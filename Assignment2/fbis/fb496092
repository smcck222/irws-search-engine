  [Text] The National Assembly has endorsed the program of 
action presented by Prime Minister Edem Kodjo this afternoon 
with an absolute majority of 41 yes votes, two against, and one 
abstention out of the 46 members of parliament who took part in 
the voting. 
  The program presented by the prime minister to parliament, 
in 
accordance with Article 78 of the 14 October Constitution, is in 
line with a spirit of openness and reaches out a hand of 
reconciliation to entire Togolese political class without 
exclusion, as Mr. Edem Kodjo put it. This program is based on a 
specific diagnosis of the social, economic, and political 
situation of our country. So, Mr. Edem Kodjo's proposals cover 
all aspects of our national life, notably, national unity, 
construction of a law- abiding state, economic and financial 
redress, security, socio- cultural development, and our 
country's foreign policy. 
  Speaking on unity and national reconciliation, the prime 
minister stressed the need for a sustained fight against 
tribalism and ethnocentrism and said the aim is to renew 
confidence in the various components of the nation by ensuring 
that Togolese men and women realize they are brothers and 
sisters. 
  [Kodjo] Democracy and law-abiding state cannot be 
achieved in Togo without this necessary effort for 
reconciliation, without reaching out a brotherly hand to 
everyone. Reconciliation will not be possible either without our 
making an effort to forgive and forget, without individual and 
collective effort to make amends, without a firm renouncement of 
unworthy acts committed by some countrymen who only see the sons 
of the same country as enemies to be vanquished and as opponents 
who must be eliminated. In short, reconciliation cannot be 
achieved without a great general pardon, which is the best form 
of a true amnesty. In order to make this reconciliation 
possible, government will strive, through the adoption of 
various legal and statutory measures, to help Togolese to 
surmount their past and rise above their recriminations in order 
to try and recreate harmony and again find the sense of common 
destiny. Preference must be given to dialogue on a permanent 
basis. Dialogue must be organized in order to stamp out rancor 
and strengthen brotherhood and solidarity. This concern for 
constant dialogue will be one of government's objectives. 
  From the economic standpoint, the prime minister first 
stressed the current economic situation of Togo which is 
presently facing a crisis aggravated in 1990 and worsened by the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. He then went on to propose 
government action in this area. 
  [Kodjo] Nothing is more urgent today than the need to 
adopt rigorous measures aimed at rescuing Togo from the serious 
financial and economic crisis facing it and whose effects have 
particularly been aggravated in some areas following the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. We must bear in mind that 
democracy and misery do not cohabit. The people's aspiration 
for democracy is an aspiration for a better life in a more open 
and free society where everyone will be able to find greater 
fulfillment and be more creative. Democracy is likely to be a 
bitter disillusionment for our people who have suffered a lot. 
Right now we do not strive to ensure a rigorous reorganization 
of the situation and a good economic and financial posture of 
our country. 
  The general economic situation, which was already 
difficult in 1990 prior to the holding of the sovereign national 
conference, seriously deteriorated later throughout the entire 
transitional period. The gross domestic product fell from 445 
billion CFA francs in 1990 to 354 billion in 1993, or a fall of 
nearly 100 billion CFA francs over the three past years with an 
external debt of 654 CFA francs. When the devaluation set in, 
prices increased by 30 to over 150 percent according to the 
products. The Togolese banking system is badly overstretched. 
The economic slump resulting from the sociopolitical upheavals 
led to heavy indebtedness of the bank thus making they less 
capable of supporting the economy. These are some of the 
factors that contribute to the bankruptcy of enterprises, 
retrenchment of staff, increase in unemployment figures, and the 
development of delinquency and misery. Government action aims 
at achieving the following objectives: obtain a gross domestic 
product growth rate of which is higher that the population 
growth rate; maintain a low inflation rate; reduce trade balance 
deficit, cut down on deficits resulting from government's 
consolidated financial transactions. These goals can only be 
achieved through the adoption of the bitter but unavoidable pill 
of structural adjustment programs with the support of 
international financial institutions and assistance from 
friendly countries. However, foreign assistance cannot only 
serve to complement internal efforts that all Togolese without 
exception will be called upon to make in a general and sustained 
solidarity move. 
  Mr. Edem Kodjo's action program is a comprehensive one 
because it touches on all aspects of national life. But then no 
program can reconstruct the country without security, the prime 
minister further stated. 
  [Kodjo] We cannot build the future Togo in the absence 
of peace and renewed security. Our country, Togo, is currently 
experiencing a new type of crime. Heinous crimes have come to 
bolster political crimes. Government will not spare any efforts 
to restore security. It will take all the necessary measures to 
discourage mounting insecurity in our country. A law-abiding 
country will be empty words in the absence of an effective 
public security personnel capable of controlling and containing 
threats to public order and to reacting to violations of 
citizens' rights and freedoms. 
  Government's proposed action to stamp out insecurity 
will both be preventive and reactive. It will be necessary, 
among other things, to improve the training of top executives of 
the police corps and the Gendarmerie, and insist on the respect 
of the hierarchy; create new structures for coordination and 
monitoring of activities of security forces and reinject 
confidence in the forces; strengthen the police force and the 
Gendarmerie staff and equip them with modern communication 
means; strengthen the criminal punishments currently provided 
for by law to punish murders; strengthen antidrug programs; set 
up a mechanism to fight against the illegal possession of arms 
and work out a plan to dismantle arms caches in close 
collaboration with the Army. 
  In fact, the Army must be one of the main pillars of 
the new society. It must be in harmony with the nation in the 
respect of the provisions of the new Constitution. In this 
regard, the government, with the assistance of Army 
headquarters, intends to organize detailed and thorough 
workshops on the defense policy and on the role of the 
Republican Army in national life. The specific and beneficial 
role of the Army will be enhanced since Republican values will 
be shared and respected by all.

  [Text] South Africa nuclear scientists are apparently 
gaining notoriety amongst the world's intelligence communities. 
The National Intelligence Service [NIS] director, Mr. Mike 
Louw, says spies are streaming into the country to try and track 
these scientists down. They are also checking on South Africa's 
capacity to produce dangerous weapons. He was speaking before 
the joint standing committee on finance in what has been 
described as a symbol of the new openness on the workings of 
South Africa's civil intelligence agency. Mr. Louw admitted 
openly that the NIS had spied on many of the community's members 
in the past. He also said that once the United States had 
closed 13 of its CIA missions in Africa, South Africa would 
probably conduct the work of these missions.

<F P=106> [Report by Edward West] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- The SA [South African] Development Bank 
was positioned to disburse R1bn [billion rand] in development 
aid to meet the goals of the reconstruction and development 
programme [RDP] in the financial year to end-March 1995, CE 
[chief executive] Andre Le Grange said yesterday. 
  He said at the launch of the bank's annual report that in 
the 
past financial year about R716.7m of project finance was 
disbursed, a 59 percent increase from the previous year's R446m. 
New project approvals for the year amounted to R1.7bn. By the 
end of March the bank had approved a cumulative total of 1,475 
programmes and projects worth R8.9bn over 11 years, while a 
further 246 projects were under consideration with an estimated 
loan value of R2.1bn. 
  Le Grange said regarding the return flow of maturing loans 
that no zero performing loans were reported in the year. Loan 
repayments, which would increase as the years passed, would play 
an important role in the continued financing of projects and in 
the repayment of capital market debt, he said. 
  The Development Bank is essentially a wholesale national 
development finance institution owned by government. Le Grange 
said the bank would maintain its "arms's length" approach to 
government so as to avoid political prescription at the cost of 
economic soundness. 
  Proposals had been made to increase the shareholding of the 
bank to include the nine provinces, but it would take time to 
implement. About 10 percent of the bank's current loan profile 
was for the funding of projects and policy development projects 
outside SA's borders, but inside the southern African region. 
  Most of these projects would benefit SA in the long run, 
such 
as the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. The bank worked closely 
with the Southern African Development Community and preferential 
trade agreement organisations on projects outside SA, and would 
continue to do so, he said. 
  He believed SA should not blindly accede to pressure to join 
regional trade agreements. SA should instead adopt a functional 
approach, starting possibly with bilateral agreements, before 
deciding on which institutional approach to take. 
  As a result of problems with the implementation of projects 
in the past financial year arising from political violence and 
uncertainty, the bank's liquidity was 39 percent. Le Grange 
said the bank aimed to reduce this to 25 percent of loan 
disbursements, which would probably result in a small surplus of 
R200m this financial year.

<F P=106> [Report by Claire Gebhardt] </F>
  [Text] Less than 5 percent of companies and only about 20 
percent of taxpayers will end up shouldering South Africa's R4 
billion [rand] transition cost. 
  Commissioner of Inland Revenue Trevor van Heerden confirmed 
at a Nedbank/Old Mutual Budget Forum in Cape Town that only 
about 15,000 of the 330,000 companies registered have taxable 
income which exceeds R50,000 -- and these are mostly blue-chip 
companies. 
  Experts said this was indicative of the financial 
difficulties companies faced as a result of the recession and 
the fact that many companies were dormant. 
  However, it could also be attributed to the practice by 
which 
many companies reduce their taxable income by inflating certain 
expenses such as directors' fees. 
  Other ploys include buying groceries through a company 
credit 
card, overseas entertainment and sundry other expenses. 
  They said many companies would now be looking to defer 
income 
and advance expenditure to avoid the levy. 
  On the personal tax side, fewer than a million taxpayers out 
of a total of about 4.5 million will have to dig into their 
pockets to fork out the 5 percent levy. 
  Van Heerden also confirmed that a negligible number of 
married women earn taxable income above R175,000 a year -- 
making this concession almost meaningless.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern Cape Province Premier Manne Dipico </F>
in the Bloemfontein studio by announcers David Hall-Green and 
Chante Hinds in the Johannesburg studio, followed by a phone-in 
question-and-answer session, on the "Good Morning, South Africa" 
program--live; italicized passages in Afrikaans] 
  [Excerpts] [Hall-Green] And now time to meet another of the 
country's new regional premiers in Good Morning South Africa's 
regular series. This morning it's premier of the Northern Cape, 
Mr. Manne Dipico, and he is in our Bloemfontein studio. [passage 
omitted] 
  Let's of course give you a little bit of background on Manne 
Dipico. A Kimberley boy, and his mother brought him up. She 
was a domestic worker at the local Kimberley hospital. He 
started working in the diamond mines and became politicized. He 
was fired from De Beers and went to Fort Hare University, and 
went a pretty predictable political course -- the National Union 
of Mineworkers and so on, and stood for the Northern Cape for 
the ANC and won by a relatively narrow margin. Let's see if we 
can now get Mr. Dipico on the line again. Good morning, Mr. 
Dipico, can you hear me now? [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Dipico, with your rising up through the ranks of the 
National Union of Mineworkers, and being so much involved in 
that particular area, is this still an area of significance for 
you in terms of mining in the Northern Cape region? Is this 
going to be one of the big challenges? 
  [Dipico] It will definitely be one of the big challenges, 
because when we look at the Northern Cape, we realize through 
the breadth and length of this province, mining in Namaqualand, 
mining in Kuruman area, mining in Kimberley, former strong 
economic base and backbone for all these years; and you realize 
that it absorbs a lot of labor. Workers within the province, 
really, you find them at the mining industry. 
  [Hall-Green] A number of the papers are this morning running 
the story of the laying off of something over 5,000 workers from 
a regional mine. Is this particularly significant, you think? 
Do you think this is a sign of things to come generally? 
  [Dipico] These are things to come. I've gone through painful 
experiences where I had to sit with mining bosses who were 
laying off workers, thousands and thousands of them. As we 
realize within the Northern Cape most of the mining houses came 
and actually benefited from the mines. They never looked at 
alternatives, because they knew that at a particular time the 
minerals will be exhausted, workers will have to be contained, 
but nothing of this sort really was considered. That is a very 
serious state of affairs, and that we will call upon the 
provincial leadership, the new government to try and look at 
alternatives: How do we remedy the situation in the future? 
  [Hinds] Mr. Dipico, if you had to give a list of priorities 
that you would like to see changed in the Northern Cape -- we 
have touched on one, the mining industry, so far -- what else 
would you like to see changed there? 
  [Dipico] The other important thing that I believe is of 
significance in our province is to change the whole scenario 
where the economy has been based primarily on primary sector in 
the mining industry and in the agricultural area. In the 
agricultural area most of the raw materials taken and be 
processed somewhere else. [sentence as heard] 
  We've got cattle, we've got sheep, we've got all the goods, 
fruit and so on. But all this is being processed somewhere 
else, and we need to change that whole scenario to move into a 
secondary manufacturing industry that is light and medium 
industry, and move into tertiary type of industries, which we 
believe will give us more scope and more potential to be able to 
jumpstart the whole economy of our province because it has been 
neglected for many, many years. 
  [Hall-Green] You talk about tertiary industry, Mr. Dipico. 
Could you be a bit more explicit and give a few examples of some 
of the industries which you would envisage in this category? 
  [Dipico] We are looking at tourism, which we believe could 
attract a lot of investors, and a lot of people from the world 
to come and look at Northern Cape. We have been looking at how 
best we can develop the area of Namaqualand, and be able to move 
in such a way that it generates a lot of funding. Within the 
Northern Cape we are looking at Kimberley itself as a historic 
place -- but it has never been used profitably -- to move into a 
lot of other important things which I think are viable for the 
economy of the province. 
  [Hinds] Mr. Dipico, coming back to yourself as the youngest 
premier so far -- have you come up against a lot of 
apprehension, maybe? 
  [Dipico] Yes, but fortunately, one has gone through a 
process 
where one can stomach, one is in a position to face the 
challenges of the future. I knew that it's not going to be 
easy. When I was elected, a lot of people were saying that you 
are very young, you don't know what you are going to look at, 
but I've met people through the length and breadth of our 
province who are prepared to cooperate, who are prepared to give 
assistance and be able to give the strength and the leadership 
to be able to overcome the problems of this province. 
  [Hall-Green] Our first caller is on the line. Sir, it's 
Charles Mannenberg, appropriately from your seat of power, and 
that of course is Kimberley. Good morning to you, Charles. 
  [Mannenberg] Good morning. Tell me, Mr. Dipico, with 
Kimberley being dominated by the mining enterprise and the 
conglomerate situation there, and the municipality tax has been 
awfully high -- and Kimberley has been awfully deprived of 
recreational facilities and sporting facilities for the last 100 
years by such enterprises -- what are you going to do about the 
situation to encourage youth to stay away from criminal 
elements, and leaving school at very early ages. How are you 
going to encourage them to uplift the situation in Kimberley 
itself? 
  [Dipico] What we are fortunate about Kimberley is that we 
are unanimous as a provincial legislature to accept Kimberley as 
a capital, and we've gone out to sell Kimberley as a capital of 
this province. That in itself brings confidence to the local 
investors, and confidence in the foreign investors to come into 
Kimberley and really to give it another picture, which is a 
positive one. And we are also looking at the mining industry, 
which is really going down. To look at new challenges and new 
other avenues which we believe can actually give Kimberley a new 
shape and a new future. This is going to go around the whole 
tourist industry, and the whole secondary industries which we 
believe will be able to absorb most of the mineworkers who have 
been retrenched. 
  Coming to the youth, within my own office of the premier we 
have set up a youth commission, and also we have a minister 
without portfolio who is dealing with youth affairs. We are 
looking at job-creation areas which we believe would be able to 
absorb the youth which is running amuck, and also looking at 
capacity building, and looking at other institutions which we 
believe will be able to bring programs into play which will give 
interests to our youth in our province, so they can be going out 
not to molest people, but to engage themselves in youth programs 
which we believe will be constructive for the province. 
  [Hinds] We have George van Tonder from Carnarvon, and 
we say good morning. 
  [Van Tonder] Premier Dipico, I would like to know what 
you are going to do about the transport services. The railway 
service has been suspended by the National Party in our remote 
towns, also the bus services. [passage omitted] 
  [Dipico] What we want to say is that we have suffered a lot 
in our province. Transport industry has really contributed to 
the neglect of our province. We have identified that we've got 
only two national roads running into our province, and that is 
very bad if you are going to link up the whole industry of our 
province. The railway area, we believe, has been a source of 
income generation. The railway....[pauses] We have been having a 
meeting. We had a meeting two weeks back with Transnet 
[Transportation Network] to look how can we give life to the 
railway lines which were linking up most of the areas. When you 
look into Kimberley, go into Carnarvon, you don't really have 
public transport. When we have to go to Upington or Springbok, 
there is really no transport at all. And we believe that the 
railway needs to be given life so that we can link up our more 
important key areas, coindustrial areas, and be able to have 
roads. There is no road running from Kimberley as a capital to 
Springbok. And we believe that the taxi industry, given better 
roads, is in a position to move from one place to another. 
Moving from Calvinia to Upington will be a much better road to 
travel if we can prepare the roads. [passage omitted] 
  [Hall-Green] We have Mr. Vic Pienaar from Delportshoop. Good 
morning. 
  [Pienaar] Good morning, Mr. Dipico. I first want to 
thank you for everything that you are planning to do for us in 
the region. As a diamond digger in the Barkley West area -- 
Delportshoop, Barkley, Winterton area -- we are fairly big job 
creators for people in the area, but we are sitting with a very 
big mineral rights problem. We must try to survive on old, 
exhausted diggings -- proclaimed state diggings. Then there are 
people and companies who have mineral rights, who are not 
interested in using them because they are too small for them 
perhaps, or difficult. What is the possibility of this business 
being addressed, and will a change come about regarding this 
mineral rights issue? 
  [Dipico] What I want to tell you is that the whole approach 
of the big mining houses, which have been exploiting the 
minerals of our province -- we have realized that it is not in 
the interest of the majority of our people in the province 
because they just took the minerals and did not plow it back. 
We need to [word indistinct] they need to be processed within 
our province. But coming to the point is that small mine 
diggers around Kimberley and around Namaqualand have suffered a 
lot. Others have been around, but they could not mine those 
diamonds because companies like De Beers own the mineral rights. 
We had a summit a month ago where we brought all the small 
diggers together to look at the proposals how do we beat, and 
how do we move in to correct the situation. 
  The proposals came to the fore saying that we need to meet 
De 
Beers and other big companies to actually bring it to their 
attention that small diggers need to be given the right also to 
dig. That will create jobs for our people in Delportshoop, 
Gonggong, Barkley West, and surrounding areas, and even in 
Namaqualand and so on. We believe that is a source for revenue 
which our province is in a position to gain. These diamonds 
will be brought and be cut in Kimberley -- processed, polished 
and be sent as a complete product which has been processed 
already. We believe that it's a source generation for us, and 
we are going to have a serious meeting with the big mining 
houses to try to give an opportunity to the mineworkers, because 
they themselves are not interested really to mine these small 
areas. [passage omitted] 
  [Hinds] We've got another caller, Lourens Estherhysen from 
the Strand. Good morning. 
  [Estherhysen] Mr. Premier, I know there's a lot of work to 
be 
done, and the ANC government as such promised a lot of 
development here, and I know there's a lot going on, and I know 
you have done a lot already, but can you tell me or the man in 
the street -- can you tell the man in the street why is there no 
physical evidence of anything going on? It's still exactly the 
same as in the old government, and most of the people in this 
area are Afrikaans-speaking. I'd like you to address them in 
Afrikaans, please. 
  [Dipico] Lourens, I would like to speak Afrikaans, my 
brother. I was born in the Northern Cape, I tried Afrikaans, 
but unfortunately I cannot do it -- at this moment. I try, but 
my tongue gets tied. I will get better; you must just give me a 
chance. I'll try to address you today in English, which is 
also one of the official languages of our province. I think you 
will have to please pardon me with that one. 
  We in this province have been inundated with calls from our 
various areas to say that what are the visible things we can see 
from the promises you have made during the campaign as the ANC 
-- ourselves, Manne Dipico, and the leadership from Mandela? I 
have been going out with my team to explain to our people what 
the process is. We are still committed to those promises, and 
we are going to fulfill these promises. We said that 
there is a timeframe to everything. We know that people are 
impatient, but we believe for Kimberley, and for Northern Cape, 
we are worse off in a sense that we don't have a building for 
the administration of running the province. We have never had a 
bureaucracy which is there in Cape Town, which is there in 
Pretoria, which is there in other provinces, even in the Free 
State. We have to go through a process of building that 
administration first and foremost. We are busy with the 
process; things are moving very fast. 
  We hope that with an efficient and effective administration 
at the provincial level, we are in a position to carry out the 
mandate for the millions of our people, and in particular in our 
province. And we are hopeful. As we are interacting, that is 
the result of the election of our people, we hope that they will 
be able to participate effectively, and involve themselves in 
programs of the government which are geared to address their own 
problems. We have been sitting this weekend in a general 
council of the ANC to see how best we can accelerate the 
program, how best can we attain the goals which we have set 
ourselves during the election. That process, we believe, is 
going to be accelerated in terms of the proposals which came 
forward. And I know that people are impatient, but it is best 
to be able to inform them how the procedure will go, how we are 
going to assist, and they themselves how they are going to 
participate and assist us to reach and accelerate that process. 
I know they want to see visible things, but I hope that in the 
near future, before the end of this year, they will be able to 
see something happening, and something visible in their little 
towns. Thank you. [passage omitted] 
  Hall-Green] Thank you, Mr. Dipico, and we wish you great 
success with your revitalization program of the Northern Cape, 
and great strength to you, and we thank you for being with us 
via our Bloemfontein studio this morning.

<F P=106> [Report by Klaas Skosana] </F>
  [Text] The Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) 
provincial government has slapped a ban on information that 
could lead to the identification of sites selected for housing 
development because it fears invasion by squatters. According 
to PWV housing and local government MEC [member of the Executive 
Council] Daniel Mofokeng, nine suitable tracts of land 
throughout the PWV area, where show houses will be built within 
weeks, have been identified. 
  But he said the location of the land cannot be made public 
for fear that squatters would invade the sites. 
  The secrecy around the location of sites follows large scale 
invasion of vacant plots of land in the PWV area in recent 
weeks. Demolition of shacks erected by 850 squatters in Devland 
and Liefde and Vrede south of Johannesburg in the past weeks 
brought PWV's premier Tokyo Sexwale into a sharp confrontation 
with the Johannesburg City Council. 
  Sites identified for relocation of squatters evicted from 
the 
Liefde and Vrede informal settlements has also been identified, 
said Mofokeng, but even this will have to be kept a secret. 
  Mofokeng told NEW NATION: "The problem is huge and serious. 
If full details of the plan are made public before actual 
construction started, the following day one may find the place 
full of squatters and delivery of proper formal housing will be 
hindered." Minister of Housing Joe Slovo earlier this month 
warned that land invasion would create additional problems for 
the authorities who were working hard to deliver housing to the 
homeless. 
  But squatters claim that, by occupying vacant land, they 
were 
helping government identify sites which could be used for 
housing development.

<F P=106> [Article from "Comment and Opinion" page: "Cyril, Roelf, </F>
Think Carefully"; published in English] 
  [Text] A non-racial election has happened, which despite 
its serious irregularities, has persuaded many that there are no 
longer real conflicts left in South Africa. 
  This is combined with a good deal of politically correct 
propaganda, much of it originating from the state media, that we 
have broken with the problems of the past, and are all together 
marching towards peace and happiness. 
  Unfortunately this is not all true. Whilst the Government of 
National Unity is a compromise wherein participants pledge 
co-operation for the common good, fundamental conflicts still 
exist. 
  Now that the election is behind us it is time to get back to 
resolving these issues. They were only temporarily set 
aside--on the understanding that they would be dealt with once 
the election was over. 
<H5>  Burning Issue </H5>
  These issues are the constitutional differences between the 
ANC and NP [National Party] on the one hand, and the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] on the other. 
  Before the election it was agreed that there be further 
international mediation around the question of federalism and 
powers for regions. 
  This is probably the most effective method of defining the 
positions of the main parties relatively quickly, and 
establishing whether there is any possibility of bridging them. 
  Otherwise we will only revisit the history of constitutional 
negotiations before April 27. A history which, for the most 
part, was about stringing the federalists along in a pointless 
process, whilst Cyril Ramaphosa, and the lets pretend opposition 
of Roelf Meyer, tried to manipulate public perception to their 
own benefit. 
<H5>  Real Opposition </H5>
  The IFP's insistence on international mediation signals that 
it is the real constitutional opponent of the ANC. In this it 
might be supported by the DP [Democratic Party], whilst impulses 
towards stronger regional powers may also come from some of the 
ANC's provincial premiers. 
  The NP, as has been clear for a long time, is not a 
constitutional opponent. Its centre-right rhetoric, which it 
mouths but does not properly understand, is mostly intended as 
carving out a niche within South Africa's political system, from 
which power and position can be preserved. 
<H5>  Old Duo </H5>
  The old duo of Ramaphosa and Meyer already appear to be 
backing away from an agreement reached with the IFP prior to the 
election, that international mediation would occur. 
  Perhaps they feel, now the IFP is in the process as they 
define it, that further attempts to humour that party are 
unjustified. 
  If so they are wrong. At the heart of the Government of 
National Unity is a compromise which has not yet been fully 
reached, and which is in important respects implied by the 
promise of mediation of the burning question of regional power. 
  Unwillingness to address this issue could make the genuinely 
multi-party nature of the national unity government short lived.

<F P=106> [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] </F>
  [Text] Hundreds of workers serving in the ANC are to be 
retrenched as part of an elaborate reorganization of the party. 
  The ANC currently has about 1,200 employees in its service. 
BEELD has been informed that the party intends trimming down 
full time staff to less than 100. 
  ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said at a 
news conference that the reorganization of the ANC will come 
into effect form 1 October. 
?? Among others things the ANC's 14 regions will be reduced to 
the nine provinces, and the ANC's departments will be reduced to 
six departments. 
  The department responsible for MK [Spear of the Nation -- 
ANC 
military wing], for instance, will be disbanded. 
  Mr. Ramaphosa said those workers who will be dismissed will 
get settlement packages retroactive from July this year. "They 
are good packages." 
  He said the ANC has not yet determined how many posts there 
will be after the reorganization. He mentioned as an example 
that the ANC currently has 13 drivers, but after reorganization 
there will be only four. 
  All posts will be advertised and preference will be given to 
the retrenched workers who apply for the posts. 
  BEELD has been told that the ANC intends to bring salaries 
for the posts on par with those earned by MP's. There have been 
many complaints among ANC members whose contention was that 
"they had made the same sacrifices in the liberation struggle, 
and yet they were earning far less than ANC members elected to 
Parliament." 
  -- The ANC has a big problem in many of its regions with 
debt 
accrued during the run-up to the election. The ANC is looking 
at "creative methods for handling the debt." 
  -- The ANC's head office remains at Shell House in 
Johannesburg. The organization will, however, now occupy 
considerably less office space. The ANC is to start a 
"sub-office" in Cape Town. 
  -- The ANC wants to extend its ties with the South African 
Communist Party, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade 
Unions], the broader democratic movement and community 
organizations, and will ensure that it remains their undisputed 
leader. 
  -- The ANC's national conference, at which a new national 
executive committee is to be elected, will be held from 17 to 22 
December. 
  -- The ANC's national working committee of 26 people is to 
be 
expanded to also include cabinet members, deputy ministers, and 
provincial premiers who had not been members of the working 
committee up to now.

  [Text] Parliament June 28 SAPA -- The cost of South 
Africa's first democratic elections rocketed from R286-million 
[rand] to an eventual R1-billion (250 percent), Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler 
told the finance committee on Tuesday [28 June]. 
  The increase was due to the introduction of a double ballot, 
an staff increase from seven monitors to 22,000, and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party's [IFP] decision in the final stage of the 
elections to take part. 
  Mr Justice Kriegler appeared before the committee against 
the 
background of the total R4-billion transition-to-democracy costs 
announced in last week's budget. 
  Outlining the escalation in election costs, the judge said 
an 
original budget of R286-million was derived from a "superficial 
survey". After five weeks, a revised budget of about 
R700-million was prepared for then State President F W de Klerk 
and the Transitional Executive Council. 
  The R700-million was made up of R375-million for election 
administration, R163-million for monitoring and R27-million for 
voter education. "That was the budget with which we proceeded 
until the eve of the elections," the judge told the committee. 
  At that stage a second appropriation document was prepared 
asking for an additional R302-million which brought the total 
budget to R1-billion. 
  The IFP's entry into the election meant an additional 549 
voting stations had to be established. The IFP sticker affixed 
to ballot papers cost R20-million. 
  The IEC had not yet finalised its accounts, but was 
expecting 
to do so by the third week of July. Thus far, the IEC had 
accounted for expenditure of R825-million. It had R51-million 
in outstanding payments and about R1.3-million in respect of 
salaries. "We will either be within our end of April budget or 
not substantially over that figure." 
  The judge said it had been impossible to mount the elections 
operation cost-effectively in four months. There had been 
excessive and wasteful expenditure. "Don't put any other 
administration in this fix ever again." 
  Answering questions on why the elections had gone more 
smoothly in white areas than in townships, the judge said that 
in Soweto for example there had been uncertainty over the number 
of voting stations until April 17. 
  The IEC had identified 237 stations but the then South 
African Police had indicated that security could only be 
provided at 180. The IEC eventually settled on 137. There was 
also the disparity in the level of services and infrastructure 
between black and white areas. At 90 per cent of the stations, 
there had been no problems. 
  He said it was correct that the election had cost R50 a 
voter. This compared favourably with a figure provided by the 
Commonwealth of 13 US dollars per voter in countries where a 
voters' roll was drawn up in tandem with an election. 
  He conceded that there had been losses and pilfering but 
said 
all IEC equipment had been insured. Less than 20 vehicles were 
still unaccounted for. 
  Mr Saki Macozoma (ANC) said the IEC needed to be 
congratulated for the work it had done. It had been seen by 
many as a way of getting "easy money". 
  The judge warned against trying to run another election 
without a voters' roll and said it would take eight months to 
prepare one.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Mining Woes -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 28 June 
in 
a page-16 editorial notes South Africa's "need to wean itself 
away from its mining roots," since old mines "cannot survive 
soaring cost pressures without a gold price that is galloping 
ever upward." The "unfortunate consequence" is that many jobs 
are being lost, but now is the time to make the adjustment while 
there are "(hopefully) improved job opportunities flowing from 
embryonic economic revival and heightened expenditure on social 
infrastructure." 
  MPs Privilege List -- A second editorial on the same page 
states that "it is entirely right" to cut free flights for 
former parliamentarians. "The big problem is the 
parliamentarians of the present, whose privilege list grows 
longer by the day and whose own free flight schedule has just 
been magnified. They should rediscover that their role is as 
public servants, not public parasites." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Mine Closures -- The impending closure of the Durban 
Roodepoort Deep gold mine "will have devastating economic and 
social effects" on those who are dependent on the remittances of 
migrant workers employed at the mine, says a page-10 editorial 
in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 28 June. "None of 
this, though, would justify a permanent and probably growing 
subsidy to a mine which has done what all mines eventually do -- 
reach the end of their natural lives. A subsidy would set a 
precedent for state assistance to numerous other lossmaking, 
marginal enterprises, outside the mining industry too." 
However, there should be "routine but comprehensive contingency 
planning to mitigate the effects of decline and closure in the 
industry." This should be the responsibility of "mine 
managements and other stakeholders -- including employees and 
adjacent local authorities -- at enterprises which are still 
going concerns to begin this work now." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Kasrils Appointment a Mistake -- "Up to now President Nelson 
Mandela has treated appointments in and around the cabinet with 
great sensitivity," notes a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg 
BEELD in Afrikaans on 27 June. However, "with the appointment 
of Mr. Ronnie Kasrils as deputy minister of defense, Mr. Mandela 
has made his first significant mistake." The integration of the 
South African National Defense Force is a "difficult process" 
which has to be handled "with great caution" since there are 
already danger signals in this regard. "If the individuals and 
component parts of the new defense force do not have confidence 
in the leadership and the process, the defensive shield could 
become a threat" since the political heads of this integration 
are both two former top figures of Spear of the Nation, the ANC 
military wing, with little known about their underground 
activities, even though an investigation "has pointed a finger 
at Mr. Modise." Mr. Kasrils's role in the Bisho massacre is 
"too well known, but further we don't know for which murder and 
maiming he has been responsible." "The appointment of a 
hardened communist in a key portfolio such as defense will shock 
many. One wonders what the international world will think while 
South Africa is urgently seeking investments." "We do not 
believe that Mr. Kasrils's appointment will promote 
reconciliation and national unity." 
  Confusion Over Amnesty Law -- A second editorial on the same 
page says "last week the Ministry of Justice announced that 63 
prisoners were released. Among them were four very 
controversial former policemen who were released on the basis of 
the Law on Further Amnesty, despite having been found guilty of 
murder. It would appear as though the amnesty order in question 
had already been signed by former President F.W. de Klerk even 
before the election, after which it was discussed with the new 
minister of justice and the new cabinet." Meanwhile, the new 
justice minister and Mr. Mandela are distancing themselves from 
this decision. "Such a situation is untenable" because if each 
amnesty case -- intended to bring about reconciliation -- has to 
be "accompanied by such controversy and discord" then it would 
be "better to suspend the whole process."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The Angolan peace talks resumed today. The 
government and National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] negotiating teams today approved 18 points 
regarding specific principles for national reconciliation. The 
negotiating teams today revised the document point by point 
because UNITA is always recanting. Thus, after verifying the 
document, government chief negotiator Faustino Muteka and UNITA 
chief negotiator Eugenio Manuvakola signed it in the presence of 
UN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the observers. 
  The negotiating teams will now begin discussing the 
modalities ?ad implementation of the dossier of national 
reconciliation. The special representative of the UN secretary 
general in Angola has already delivered to the government and 
UNITA negotiating teams the intermediary document on the 
modalities and its implementation. The government and UNITA 
will have to react to it by 29 June. 
  Meanwhile, the issue regarding the modalities and its 
implementation includes Jonas Savimbi's special status which was 
scheduled to be discussed in the specific principles, but at 
UNITA's request the document was postponed until the end. Now 
UNITA wants to withdraw the issue from the agenda, claiming that 
it is not necessary to discuss a special status for its leader, 
because the document on the accommodation and security of UNITA 
and its high officials includes Jonas Savimbi. 
  The government has rejected this, saying that on point eight 
the issue only related to UNITA leaders -- that is, deputies, 
members of the political commission, and those who will 
eventually take administrative and military posts at a higher 
level, but Jonas Savimbi was not included. To avoid future 
obstacles, the government wants Jonas Savimbi's status to be 
discussed, because UNITA is always recanting, and one cannot 
withdraw a point from an agenda of negotiations as delicate as 
this, as UNITA intends to.

  [Text] No session of the peace talks was held in Lusaka, 
Zambia, today. 
  Mediator Alioune Blondin Beye is presently examining 
documents received from the government and the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] connected with the 
implementation of modalities for national reconciliation. Alves 
Antonio reports: 
  The mediator in the Angolan peace process has changed his 
tactic. He is currently examining the documents from the 
government and UNITA connected with the implementation of 
modalities for national reconciliation, so as to come up with a 
compromise which will serve as a foundation for the 
negotiations. Thus, the representatives of the government and 
UNITA remain on alert in their hotels. 
  President Frederick Chiluba is expect to receive Alioune 
Blondin Beye today to discuss issues connected with the Angolan 
peace process. 
  Meanwhile, members of opposition parties from the 
extra-parliamentary group began the day well. They were 
received by Ambassador (Rocha Pares), representing the troika of 
observers in the Angolan peace process, and they gave him a 
proposal which they consider as an alternative for the present 
peace talks. Thereafter, they met with government 
representatives. At the end of the meeting, the spokesman for 
the extra-parliamentary group spoke to the reporting team of the 
Angolan National Radio. 
  [Begin unidentified official recording] Today, 28 June, we 
also held a meeting with the government team. We presented our 
plan and they briefed us on ongoing discussions. We saw a 
certain understanding, a clear optimism on the side of the 
government, and thus we think that the process is on the right 
track. We encouraged the team to continue with this conduct so 
that peace can be found as soon as possible, since many people 
are dying in Angola. [end recording]

  [Text] Peace is in Lusaka, not in Angola. Weapons are 
still displacing words. Kuito, N'dalatando, Malanje, and 
Menongue are war zones. In the capital of Bie Province, clashes 
once again broke the silence, with Savimbi's bitter soldiers 
concentrating their artillery on Kunje commune. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao reports: 
  [Abraao] Kuito awakened today to the explosions of 
shells from long range guns of the Black Cockerel soldiers. 
Yesterday evening and dawn today were described as the most 
violent since the resumption of the clashes on 26 May. Despite 
the fact that human and material losses caused by the Jamba 
soldiers over the last few hours are not known, some military 
sources say that they are the most extensive. Kuito is 
currently experiencing an unprecedented bloodbath. 
  Yesterday it was the Kunje commune which came under 
intense shellings of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Today the rebels are 
mercilessly shelling the martyred city of Kuito. 
  Besides the shellings, the soldiers under the service 
of Jonas Savimbi have been launching attacks on government 
forces positions. Over the past 24 hours, government forces 
stationed in Kunje commune killed 23 UNITA soldiers and captured 
20 AKM arms, two 60 mm mortars, an antitank missile, two Land 
Rover vehicles, and 87 shells for B-10 guns. The government 
forces' response to the enemy of the people has been 
effective. 
  Brigadier Lucume, second commander of the Angolan Armed 
Forces [FAA] in Bie, publicly told the local press 
today that following UNITA provocations, government forces 
reoccupied the main military positions of Jonas Savimbi's 
organization during 30 days of hard clashes. At present 
[places indistinct] and some areas south east and 
northeast of Kuito are under the control of government troops, 
while government forces stationed in Kunje have repelled UNITA 
rebels who for than a year had been in [place 
indistinct], 4 km from the capital of the commune located 
north of Kuito. 
  In Malanje the military situation is still worrisome, but 
the 
FAA is scoring victories over UNITA. Our correspondent Jose 
Luis reports: 
  [Luis] A total of 11 Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola [FALA] soldiers were killed on 25 June in the 
trade area 15 km from Malanje when they tried to attack 
government forces. The FAA, National Police, and civilian 
defense recovered seven AKM automatic weapons and an assortment 
of infantry ammunition from the UNITA rebels, as well as 
capturing one soldier. 
  Reports from the northeast military front General Staff 
say that government forces on 25 June repelled a rebel ambush 
in [place indistinct], killing 12 soldiers in UNITA's 
illegal army, capturing nine AKM weapons and 1,300 rounds of 
infantry ammunition. 
  After being repelled in N'dalatando the rebels once again 
shelled Popular Ward yesterday, wounding dozens of civilians who 
are facing a difficult situation because there is no medicine in 
the provincial hospital. Our correspondent Abilio Correia 
reports: 
  [Correia] UNITA launched five shells which did not 
cause any significant damage, although they partially destroyed 
some houses. A number of people admitted to N'dalatando's 
hospital due to the UNITA shellings need emergency aid since 
they face shortages of medicine and food. 
  UNITA troops launched a strong attack on Cuchi District, 
Cuando Cubango Province, on 25 June. Government troops are 
still controlling the town. Freitas Manuel reports: 
  [Manuel] A military source in Cuchi today told our 
reporters that UNITA forces launched a strong attack on 
government forces on 25 June with the intention of dislodging 
them from the district. Five UNITA battalions have arrived in 
the area and are besieging the town. Besides infantry attacks, 
the rebels are using long range artillery pieces. Civilians 
were the main victims of the weekend attacks. UNITA soldiers 
killed 25 people, wounded 18 others, and destroyed a number of 
houses. The same military source said that during the clashes 
government forces killed 12 UNITA soldiers and seized an 
assortment of military equipment. 
  Meanwhile, the tragedy of Cuchi residents is more than 
this. They face shortages of food and medicine. Lately at least 
two people have died daily of hunger and a lack of medical 
assistance.

  [Text] Military sources say National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] antiaircraft forces shot down a 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] airplane in Huila Province on 26 June 1994. The 
sources say a Russian-made MiG-23 was hit while attacking 
civilian targets in Ngola region, north of Lubango. It all 
happened at about 1240. After being hit the aircraft tried to 
return to the Lubango Air Force Base, but exploded near the 
runway, killing all its crew. The sources added that UNITA 
armed forces are able to thwart the MPLA-PT's air force 
arrogance. 
  Meanwhile, it has been reported that fierce clashes took 
place in Huila Province where the MPLA-PT is involved in 
military offensives against UNITA. In defensive operations 
carried out by UNITA's Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola, an MPLA motorized convoy was attacked on the road 
between Cacula and [name indistinct]. 
  Our forces killed 14 MPLA-PT soldiers and wounded 32 others. 
UNITA also captured MPLA Major Manuel Bravante Ngongo, born in 
Pambangala, Cuanza Sul Province's Cassongue District. Maj. 
Ngongo was the commander of the 4th Motorized Infantry Battalion 
stationed in Cacula and the leading officer behind the offensive 
in the northern region of Huila Province.

  [Text] The issue of South African mercenaries in the 
Angolan civil war once again surfaced yesterday. Captain (Van 
du Toit), who in the 1980's was a prisoner in the hands of the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party 
[MPLA-PT] in Cabinda, traveled to Cabo Ledo to supervise 
military training of the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA], MPLA troops. This is a paradox 
since it is known that Nelson Mandela intends to assist in 
ending the Angolan conflict. Will the mercenaries contribute to 
peace in Angola? This is the big question placed before Nelson 
Mandela's good offices.

  [Text] The Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda 
Enclave-Armed Forces of Cabinda [FLEC-FAC] recently abducted 
three traditional leaders in Belize District, Cabinda Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified official] In fact, three 
traditional leaders were abducted by FLEC-FAC recently. I do 
not know what the causes of the abduction are. I cannot say 
anything else because I am still investigating the issue. It is 
only known that they have been detained. Maybe it is because 
they are traditional leaders linked to the government. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] According to reports you have, 
are they in a good health? 
  [Official] Well, recently we received a message from the 
Belize District administration saying that they are being 
ill-treated and run the risk of being killed. Two days ago, 
however, I received a report from the Belize administrator 
saying that they are in good health and have a limited freedom, 
but they are still in the hands of FLEC. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] On the occasion of the celebration of the 19th 
aniversary of national independence, President of the Republic 
Joaquim Chissano said that the issue of an eventual government 
of national unity has not been definitely put aside. [passage 
omitted] 
  The president of the Republic also said he was not worried 
about his fate or that of his party in the forthcoming 
elections. Chissano said: I would only be very worried if there 
was another war in Mozambique. I am not worried about whether I 
will continue as the country's president. The president added 
that he would be worried if we failed to create a better future, 
which is our challenge for the future. He said the forthcoming 
elections should bring the results wished for by the Mozambican 
people.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama yesterday confirmed his huge 
popularity in the city of Beira. More than 20,000 people 
gathered at the city center's CFM [Mozambique Railroad] square 
to watch and listen. 
  They began gathering at 0600 as scores of people arrived 
from 
within and outside the city. The rally was scheduled to begin 
at 0800, but the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] leader 
only arrived at 1230. Despite the long delay, everybody stayed 
put. 
  The rally ended at approximately 1500. People nearly invaded 
the tribune. The atmosphere of popular sympathy for Dhlakama 
was at one stage opposed by a group of war crippled who showed 
up, holding placards demanding compensation and the "return" of 
their limbs. 
  There were instances of violence -- which did not stop the 
rally -- when Renamo sympathizers surrounded the crippled and 
took their placards which were then destroyed. 
  Dhlakama's speech was basically a triumphant and emotional 
one, centering around his own image. The Renamo leader left the 
rally saying that "I have already won" in Beira. 
  His speech was marked by a lack of any reference to Renamo's 
program for the future. This was an issue raised at the 22 June 
meeting with Beira's businessmen. A local businessman told 
MEDIAFAX that the audience heard Dhlakama reiterating his 
solidarity with the Mozambican business sector and his 
commitment to a market economy; that pleased businessmen. The 
source added, however, that businessmen left the meeting with 
the impression that Dhlakama has no concrete economic program to 
present. 
  After yesterday's rally and at journalists' request, 
Dhlakama 
gave a news conference during which he reiterated his opposition 
to war. A journalist asked him why he only asks for money for 
Renamo and not for reconstructing the country whenever he 
travels abroad. 
  He replied that "the priority" right now is to establish 
Renamo among the people and that economic matters are "for the 
government." He added that he would deal with he country's 
economic matters once he was in government. 
  All our sources have told us that Dhlakama's visit to Beira 
proceeded without unrest between Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation 
Front] and Renamo sympathizers and served to confirm what was 
expected -- that the country's second largest city is the main 
center of electoral support for Renamo and for Dhlakama in 
particular.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama continues his visit to Sofala Province in 
preparation for the first general multiparty election due to be 
held on 27 and 28 October. Tome Igreje reports. 
  Everyone must register in order to actively take part in the 
coming multiparty elections scheduled for October this year. 
This was the principal message conveyed by Renamo President 
Afonso Dhlakama to the residents of Dondo and the administrative 
post of Mafambice yesterday. 
  Accompanied by Raul Domingos and Sofala provincial 
representative Manuel Pereira, Afonso Dhlakama reminded the 
people that the war between Renamo and the government has ended 
and he gave assurances that it will not be repeated in 
Mozambique. Proclaiming himself the defender of democracy, 
freedom, and justice in Mozambique, the Renamo leader said the 
people must prepare themselves to choose their president and 
government for the next five years. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] A voter registration process is 
under way throughout the country at present. Voter registration 
teams are recording the names, place of birth, and age of 
prospective voters. After that they distribute voter 
registration cards. I would, therefore, like to request my 
parents here, all the people here to go to voter registration 
centers. Voter registration is vital for you to be able to vote 
in the election. No matter how you like this or that party, you 
cannot vote without being registered as a voter. 
  The war has ended in Mozambique. I am the one who is saying 
it. I do not want to hear of war any more. I do not even want 
to see someone holding an AK-47. [end recording] 
  Afonso Dhlakama said proudly that he had defeated the armed 
forces of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and their 
allies of the eastern block. Frequently applauded by thousands 
of people present at the Mafambice rally, the Renamo leader 
removed his spectacles on several occasions to show his eyes to 
the people. He told the people that they should look at him 
closely so that they could better recognize him, in an apparent 
appeal to them to choose him in the coming presidential 
elections. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] I can say with pride that Renamo 
won the war. Renamo defeated Frelimo together with all its 
allies. [applause] Let us now forget war. Let us now forget war 
and speak about peace. Let us speak of peace. 
  I am always in Maputo, holding talks with my brother the 
president of the Republic. This means, therefore, that the war 
has ended. The only war that now remains is the political war. 
There should be no more hatred. We should not say: This one 
belongs to Frelimo. I do not want to associate with him because 
I belong to Renamo. That has ended. Now we are going to wage a 
political war. 
  The power now is in the hands of the Mozambican people. It 
is up to them to choose the future president of Mozambique who 
will be able to respect their supreme interests. We say thank 
you for your presence here at this rally. [preceding sentence in 
Sena] Thank you, thank you very much, Mozambican people. [end 
recording] 
  The Renamo president then left for Mafambice in a luxurious 
Mercedes Benz. There he visited the installations of the sugar 
factory and was briefed on its operation. At present the 
factory is paralyzed. 
  Afonso Dhlakama also visited other districts of Sofala 
Province today, but these were not named for security reasons. 
  At a meeting presided over by Afonso Dhlakama in Dondo 
yesterday, two citizens were detained by Renamo men for 
allegedly carrying placards which were against Renamo. The two 
men were forcibly carried by Afonso Dhlakama's men to Mafambice, 
where the second rally took place. 
  In Mafambice journalists wanted to approach the two citizens 
who were detained in a vehicle but were prevented from doing so 
by Renamo men who said there was no reason to interview them. 
Following journalists' insistence, the Renamo men said there was 
no major problem with the detained people. They were there just 
to investigate who sent them to the meeting with the placards, 
which the journalists were unable to see. The two men were 
later on released before the holding of the mass rally.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chaotic Growth"] </F>
  [Text] Nineteen years after independence, Mozambique is a 
case of chaotic economic growth. 
  On one hand, there is a productive sector that is being 
increasingly pushed into activities that are typical of an 
informal economy. On the other hand, there is an "unstoppable" 
informal commercial sector which ends either at the doorsteps of 
the black market or of organized crime, though it starts 
precisely with the fast moving privatization of the state 
apparatus. 
  Within the state sector civil servants behave more like mini 
private enterprises, using the taxes paid by the productive 
sector as the financial basis of their own businesses which, by 
and large, imply growing levels of extortion from the productive 
sector. 
  The situation is becoming so rampant that if there is 
anything that can unite entrepreneurs of the so-called formal 
sector -- which has no businesslike solidarity -- it would be a 
common action against taxes, plunging civil servants into 
unemployment, including those who adhere to ethics in their jobs. 
  In any case, some 60 percent of the General State Budget, 
including the payment of civil servants' salaries, already comes 
from foreign funds. In plain language, that means that 60 
percent of our sovereignty needs to be reacquired. In other 
words, 19 years after its independence, Mozambique is far less 
independent than in 1975. 
  The possibility of a recovery is today more viable than in 
October 1992 when the Rome accord was signed. 
  It was sufficient to have a few months of peace and a good 
agricultural season (92/93) for the statistics to show a 19 
percent growth. This figure does not give us a reason to 
celebrate -- the starting point being so insignificant -- but it 
is undoubtedly an indication of our real working capacities and 
sense of initiative. 
  In cities today thousands of Mozambican households once 
again 
receive food from relatives somewhere in the rural areas, there 
are thousands of retailers doing business across the border, and 
hundreds of truckers are in business for most of the year. 
  There is, therefore, an atmosphere of growth in terms of 
quantity and variety in business transactions. That atmosphere 
proves that it can withstand the political uncertainties of a 
country heading to multipartyism. 
  Out of the chaos in which those transactions take place, and 
of the standards that gradually emerge, a system regulating the 
economy will eventually surface. It will be free of the 
claustrophobia that characterizes the colonial and socialist 
formal sectors, and of the dangers posed by the crumbling of a 
state as seen in Rwanda. 
  Elsewhere, in a scenario that cannot be defined, the country 
will find a balance between central command and individual 
enterprise. The 19 percent growth is perhaps an indication that 
that may happen sooner than expected.

  [Text] Military equipment to the value of N$4.2 million 
[Namibian dollars] was handed over to the Namibian Defense Force 
by the German Army at Luiperdsvallei outside Windhoek on 
Thursday. The equipment consists of eight standard troop 
carriers, five recovery vehicles, workshops, and the required 
spare parts. The vehicles form part of the German Government's 
donation of N$13.2 million of military equipment to the Ministry 
of Defense over a three-year period. Although technical 
assistance from the German Army was supposed to have been 
suspended at the end of this year, Minister of Defense Peter 
Mueshihange announced that the German Government favorably 
considered Namibia's request to extend the assistance by an 
additional three years. The minister said: "We appreciate the 
assistance because it ensures the Namibian Army's mobility and 
independence in the area of transportation." 
  Since the cooperation agreement came into effect in 1992, 
certain members of the Namibian Defense Force were trained by an 
engineering team from the German Ministry of Defense in MAN 
mechanics. The members who passed the training exercise were 
then allowed to train other personnel in the fixing of MAN 
vehicles. MAN vehicles form the largest part of the Namibian 
Defense Force's troop carriers and delivery vehicles. The 
Ministry of Defense, therefore, has made a policy decision to 
use MAN as the Army's standard troop carrier and delivery 
vehicle. "The decision was made because of the vehicle's power 
and reliability. A decision will be made soon on standard 
control and administrative vehicles. Standardization is 
necessary because it alleviates the problem experienced with 
shortage of spare parts and improves the standard of 
maintenance," according to Mr. Mueshihange.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 27 Jun (KNA/PANA) -- Former President 
Pierre Buyoya said Friday [24 June] in a televised broadcast 
that he was concerned by the "deep contradictions within the 
government" that could plunge Burundi in a civil war as 
atrocious as the one raging in Rwanda. While some are 
negotiating in an attempt to reinstate the presidential 
institution, others are preparing for war, he said, in apparent 
reference to the case of the minister of the interior, Leonard 
Nyangoma, who disappeared three months ago. 
  The former Burundi president said he perceived the "obvious 
signs of a civil war" in the fiery statements of some senior 
government officials and the operation of an unlicenced radio 
station calling for ethnic hatred and the arming of civilians. 
  Buyoya called for an end to "political bickerings" to avert 
civil war in the central African country. Urging his fellow 
countrymen to think about the 500,000 dead and three million 
displaced people in neighbouring Rwanda, he declared that he 
believed the Burundi people had other more urgent challenges to 
tackle. 
  In another development, the former Burundi president 
disapproved of French intervention in Rwanda, saying it came too 
late. Buyoya explained that it was "everything but a 
humanitarian initiative". The Rwandan crisis, he said, was a 
tragic theatre, adding that France, a country which was not 
neutral, could not, alone, play all the roles, as such, it could 
not act as a fair umpire between the warring parties, he added. 
  Pierre Buyoya, who spearheaded the democratic process in his 
country which led to the first multiparty elections of last 
June, said he was sceptical about the fate of democracy in 
Africa. According to him "it is a raw deal which does not take 
into account African realities and only the West stands to gain 
from the process."

  [Text] Ouagadougou, 24 Jun (AFP) -- The Burkinabe prime 
minister today in Ouagadougou announced the launching of a 
three-year (1994-1996) agricultural development program that 
will cost 62 billion CFA francs (Fr 620 million) and the 
introduction of a "new and more stimulating investmement code." 
  In a general policy statement before the Assembly of 
People's 
Deputies, he recalled that the "immediate effects" of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc last January have strongly 
disturbed the country's economic balances. 
  He said his goal is to reach a real growth rate of more than 
five percent a year by 1996, to limit the rise in prices of 
consumer goods, and to reduce deficits in public finances. 
  On the political plane, he announced that municipal 
elections 
would be held "in the first half" of February 1995.

  [Text] Negotiating teams from the government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
today approved specific principles for the implementation of 
modalities for national reconciliation. As is normally the 
case, in its attempt to hinder the peace talks, UNITA wants to 
introduce new elements in the issue connected with Jonas 
Savimbi's status which has already been discussed and has 
received the consensus of all parties. Our correspondent Alves 
Antonio reports. 
  Negotiating teams from the government and UNITA have finally 
approved specific principles for national reconciliation which, 
among other things, include the issue of installations for Jonas 
Savimbi's organization. Thus, the government and UNITA are now 
able to tackle practical issues in the implementation of 
modalities for national reconciliation which include the major 
guidelines and a future government of national unity. 
  Surprisingly, UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim said and we 
quote, it is not necessary to have a special status for 
President Savimbi, unquote. Meanwhile, regarding this issue, 
the government version is different in that Savimbi's status has 
already been discussed and approved. What UNITA now wanted was 
to introduce new changes. This being the case, the government 
is demanding from UNITA a written document saying that it wants 
to withdraw this issue from the dossier.

  [Text] The leaders of 14 African countries met in 
Libreville today to make a preliminary assessment six months 
after the devaluation of the CFA franc. Even before this summit 
began, Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, was at pains to 
clarify that there is to be no further devaluation. The 
adjustment of 11 January is the final one. This comment is in 
response to the concern expressed by certain African heads of 
state, and is also intends to kill off the rumors still 
circulating in Africa. This statement by Alain Juppe was 
recorded by Laurent Bertaud: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We have not changed our strategy in 
any way. The strategy for the franc zone is the maintenance of 
fixed exchange rates, and all these rumors circulating are 
clearly being fostered by those who want to make the operation 
fail. This was a once and for all adjustment, and, I repeat, we 
have good reason to believe today that it is succeeding. This 
is due to many factors: the aid that has been made available by 
France -- which, contrary to what has been said, has not 
abandoned Africa, quite the opposite -- and by international 
financial institutions, but it is also due to the determination 
of the African governments and the maturity of the people, who 
have displayed a strong sense of responsibility when faced with 
what is obviously a difficult measure. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] African heads of state and government from 14 
franc zone countries are meeting this afternoon in Libreville 
six months after the devaluation of the CFA franc. The summit 
will take stock of the situation after the devaluation and it 
follows two previous mini summits of the West African Monetary 
Union and the Central African Economic and Monetary Community 
for Central Africa. Closed consultations focused on reports 
drawn up by experts last week in Libreville and then completed 
by the finance ministers of the franc zone. One of their 
recommendations was the revamping of economic activities by 
placing emphasis on the payment of internal debts. Then the 
heads of state will review the way the devaluation of the CFA 
franc was managed, Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba, said 
in Libreville this morning. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>
  [Excerpts] The summit of the heads of state of the franc 
zone has just ended at the Presidential Palace in Libreville. 
It began late this morning and its purpose was to take stock of 
the financial situation in the 14 countries of the franc zone 
six months after the devaluation of the CFA franc. This summit, 
proposed on the sidelines of the funeral of late President 
Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire in Yamoussoukro, was aimed at 
harmonizing the economic policies of the countries concerned to 
cushion the impact of the devaluation. 
  In the same vein, while opening the summit in his country 
this morning, President Omar Bongo of Gabon, called on his peers 
to work towards a genuine integration: 
  [Bongo] What is needed here is to take stock of what 
has been achieved so far and to define some orientations for our 
common future. We will look at the progress made in the 
implementation of various programs set up by the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the effective mobilization 
of aid promised in Dakar both by France and the other financial 
backers. As for our countries debts, the monetary adjustment 
has contributed to increase (?taxes) and the present treatment 
no longer appears to be adapted to enable progress in the 
implementation of the policy of new integration instruments 
within the zone of West African Monetary Union and the Bank of 
Central African States. 
  Today, more than in the past, the fate of our countries 
lies in our own hands. We have the duty to resolutely commit 
ourselves to implement a genuine integration process, without 
any ulterior motives and without selfishness. 
  The summit continued in the afternoon behind closed doors 
and 
12 of the 14 heads of state attended. Persistent rumors have 
been circulating on a possible devaluation of the CFA franc. 
The rumors are denied by the Africans and their economic 
partners along with the IMF, the World Bank, and France. 
  Correspondent Franck Medome talked to Niger president 
Mahamane Ousmane on a possible devaluation. President Ousmane 
said that the devaluation rate decided in Dakar was fixed at 50 
percent to prevent further devaluation: 
  [Ousmane] First of all, I would like to say that this 
decision will not be made now. These rumors are circulating 
just because people are seeing the 14 heads of state of the 
franc zone meeting here in Libreville with other partners. This 
makes people think of a new devaluation, especially when they 
remember the Dakar summit in January. They saw the heads of 
state meet in Dakar and saw the outcome and now the same heads 
of state are meeting in Libreville and think that this is to 
devaluate the CFA franc once again. No. This is not the case. 
People should understand that at the Dakar summit we agreed to 
devaluate the CFA franc by 50 percent in order to ensure a 
further devaluation was unneccessary. We said this was once and 
for all and would last for years to come. And this should be 
clear, there will be no other devaluation. It would be 
nonsense. 
  [Medome] We can therefore be sure that President 
Mahamane Ousmane will not be contradicted. There will be no 
other devaluation of the CFA franc, at least not for the time 
being. 
  [Ousmane] That is the truth. [passage omitted] 
  Several resolutions were adopted at the end of the 
Libreville 
summit. Among them, the resolution on Rwanda: 
  [Unidentified rapporteur] Preoccupied by the massacres 
of the Rwanda civilian populations and the massive destruction 
taking place in Rwanda for several months, satisfied with the 
decision made at the OAU summit and the efforts made recently by 
the international community to end this intolerable situation, 
including Resolution No. 929 of the UN Security Council on 22 
June 1994, and [words indistinct] in line with the same 
resolution on humanitarian grounds by several members of the 
United Nations at the initiative of France and some African 
states, and while waiting for the reinforcement of troops of the 
UN Observer Mission in Rwanda, we call on the entire 
international community and especially on African states to 
contribute and increase the UN troops in Rwanda in order to make 
them more operational. We also call on the heads of state of 
neighboring countries to pursue their mediation efforts in order 
to find a lasting solution to the conflict, and stress the need 
for urgent action from African states to find a peaceful 
solution to the conflict and to ensure the protection of the 
population and the return of civil peace.

  [Excerpt] The French soldiers yesterday pushed their 
patrols forward as far as 20 km from battlefields in Gikongoro 
Prefecture. According to Captain Emmanuel Ndahiro of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Army [RPA], French soldiers found to be standing in 
RPA's way will be asked to account for it. 
  Although Paris describes the present mission as a 
humanitarian one, nobody is fooled by the real intentions of its 
intervention which is to protect criminals. Moreover, these 
criminals have started (?rejoicing). Prime Minister Kambanda, 
the so-called prime minister, for example, announced clearly the 
day before the French troops landed in Goma and Bukavu in 
eastern Zaire, that his men had received new consignments of 
arms which would enable them to celebrate the 32nd independence 
anniversary in Kigali on 1 July. [passage omitted].

50." The box is 15 cm square and 4 cm thick. On one of its 
sides, a silver and blue plate -- marked "Litton" -- stands out 
against the black background. In the center is an electrical 
socket, sealed with red wax, connected up to a dozen or so 
colored wires to a pin plug that hangs free. 
  The aircraft of the late Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana, which crashed on 6 April in Kigali leading to his 
death and that of the president of Burundi and the 10 other 
passengers and crew members, did indeed have a "black box," 
irrespective of what has been claimed since, and this black box 
is now in Paris. Former Captain Paul Barril, the former 
commander of the GIGN (National Gendarmerie Intervention Unit), 
a one-time member of the famous "cell" of gendarmes at the 
Elysee [French presidential palace] and now the unofficial 
adviser to several black African and Middle Eastern heads of 
state, claims to have obtained the box in Kigali and says he 
will make it "available to the international authorities." 
  The existence of this flight recorder -- to use the 
technical 
term -- is stubbornly denied in official circles, but former 
Captain Barril showed it to a LE MONDE journalist on Thursday, 
23 June, in the offices of his company, named Secrets, in Avenue 
de la Grande Armee in the 17th district of Paris. 
  The former Army officer claims he has been to Rwanda twice 
since the presidential aircraft crashed, during April and at the 
beginning of May, to investigate, at the family's request, the 
circumstances surrounding the death of the Rwandan head of 
state, which no one still believes was an accident. Shortly 
after 2030 on Wednesday, 6 April, as it was preparing to land at 
Kigali airport's only runway, the Falcon 50 was hit in the rear 
by two rockets and crashed on the grounds of the presidential 
residence, which is near the airport. Paul Barril shows 
photographs taken by President Habyarimana's youngest son 
depicting the debris piled up on the lawn and the bloody bodies 
of the victims. They were published in the 28 April edition of 
the JEUNE AFRIQUE weekly. He also readily shows the photos he 
took on his two trips to Kigali, some of which show him next to 
a piece of artillery and standing in front of the French Embassy 
in Kigali, which has been deserted since the last French 
nationals left on the morning of 12 April. 
  Agathe Habyarimana, the president's widow who is exiled in 
France with her children, gave Barril "a mandate for 
investigation and research" on 6 May that lays down the 
conditions of his mission: "To make all investigations he 
considers useful to uncover the truth surrounding the attack," 
discover "the guilty parties and, in particular, those in 
command," and take "all necessary action with the insurers." A 
French lawyer, Helene Clamagirand, was moreover charged with 
drawing up a legal report and lodging "in the coming weeks" a 
murder charge with the International Court of Justice in the 
Hague. 
<H5>  `Everything Is OK' </H5>
  In addition to the famous black box -- and no one knows what 
its decryption, requiring special equipment, will reveal -- 
former Captain Barril has returned from his Rwandan visits with 
the Kigali airport control tower tapes: three large, 
Assmann-brand aluminum reels, each containing eight hours of 
tape. These should contain the last conversations between the 
presidential plane and the tower controllers on 6 April. He 
also has in his possession all the telexes received by the 
airport in the days leading up to the attack, the airport's 
"duty book," which contains the names of the three men who were 
on duty in the airport on 6 April, and the book of "transmission 
and radio navigation services," whose last entry, dated 5 April 
at 0742 (universal time), noted that "the recorder has again 
been unblocked" after a power cut and concluded: "Everything is 
OK." 
  In truth, the African findings of the former gendarme have 
been an open secret in the French Government for a number of 
weeks. The personal cabinet of Cooperation Minister Michel 
Roussin confirmed that "contacts" had been made with Paul 
Barril, but both parties claim with equal vigor to have started 
the initiative. For his part, the former captain told us that: 
"All the elements in my possession will be made available to 
the international authorities as soon as an inquiry is launched." 
  The initial effect of the intervention of the burdensome 
captain, whose adventurous profile is well-known but his motives 
less so, has been to show up the absence of any official 
procedure to identify the perpetrators of the attack on the 
Falcon, despite the declarations made the day after 6 April. 
Almost three months later, neither the United Nations, which 
was then responsible for security in Rwanda, nor Burundi, whose 
president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, also died in the plane crash, nor 
France itself, despite the loss of three French crew members, 
have yet launched any kind of inquiry. 
  Only an initiative by the families of the crew members could 
lead to the case being submitted to an examining magistrate by 
way of the same procedure that was used in 1989 after the attack 
on the UTA DC-10 over the Chad desert, whose case was submitted 
to Parisian Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere. At the end of last 
week, a close collaborator of Mr. Roussin told us: "The 
families are free to bring a case to justice." Charged with 
defending the interests of the family of the Rwandan president, 
Mrs. Clamagirand makes no bones about the fact that she would 
like a number of other cases to be brought in association with 
hers to "break the rule of silence" surrounding a terrorist act 
without which Rwanda would probably not be the war-torn country 
it is today. 
  There are still the investigations being made by the Belgian 
military auditors attached to the Belgian Justice Ministry, 
which has been charged with establishing the causes not of the 
attack, but of the subsequent death of 12 Belgian Blue Helmets. 
Nobody knows what progress they have made with their 
investigation, but it would appear that the Brussels civil 
servants have modest resources and to date they have only 
focused on obtaining information on the circle of Hutu students 
in Belgium. They want to know who killed the soldiers and how. 
On 8 April, the Belgian Defense Ministry indicated that the 
soldiers had been "apprehended, led away, and executed" while 
they were trying to protect the fleeing Rwandan prime minister, 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was murdered in Kigali during the 
massacres that began shortly after the aircraft exploded. On 
the same day, the United Nations stated that they had been 
killed after being disarmed by members of the Presidential Guard 
while they were on their way to the airport to investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the death of the president and his 
Burundian counterpart. On 15 April, a memo from the Rwandan 
foreign minister to all diplomatic missions in the world 
reported the arrest of "three suspects" from the "Belgian 
contingent" when they tried to "retrieve by force the black box 
from the wreck of the aircraft." 
<H5>  Mercenaries from Europe </H5>
  This succession of contradictory reports illustrates, as if 
it was necessary, the confusion that reigns in Rwanda and that 
prevents any hope of a rapid clarification of the circumstances 
surrounding the attack. All sides -- the Hutus in the 
presidential circle of supporters and guard, those in the 
regular army, and the Tutsis in the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] -- have their own version of events, their own 
suspicions, and their own insinuations. Any verification on the 
ground is now impossible: The RPF has taken control of the 
airport zone, and many of the witnesses to the attack and the 
ensuing conflict have perished. Thus, the information published 
in the Belgian daily LE SOIR, whereby the Rwandan presidential 
plane was brought down by "two French soldiers" and which 
claimed to coincide "on a number of points, with the inquiry 
being carried out in Belgium by the military auditors," was met 
with denials, not just from the French Government, but also from 
the Belgian Government. In any event, the report substantiated 
a hypothesis floated by the intelligence services of both 
countries whereby the guilty parties are indeed "two white men," 
who could be mercenaries from Europe or South Africa. So who 
were they working for? 
  During May, the French secret services indicated that, at 
the 
end of last year, "an American company represented in Central 
Africa" had tried to recruit, through Belgian intermediaries, 
mercenaries skilled in handling antitank and antiaircraft 
missiles. Part of the recruiting is said to have been done in a 
hotel in the 17th district of Paris. According to the DGSE 
(General Directorate for External Security), the operation was 
to have taken some 15 or so men from Brussels to Nairobi and 
then to Uganda, from where they would infiltrate Rwanda "to sow 
the seeds of discontent in the regular Rwandan army." However, 
the attempt came to nothing. 
  An investigation into the supposed motives of each party 
does 
not add to any convictions. Did the RPF have any interest in 
killing a president who, although abhorred, was to bring it into 
government on 4 August in accordance with the Arusha agreements? 
As for the "hard core" supporters of the regime, who took their 
members from the presidential entourage itself, they could have 
been trying to prevent any reconciliation with the Tutsi 
minority, but the presence on board the Falcon of Colonel Elie 
Sagatwa, one of their leaders, considerably weakens this 
argument. As for France, it is hard to see what advantage it 
could have had from eliminating a regime it stands accused of 
having supported in favor of rebels who treat it openly as an 
enemy. 
  In any event, the fact that many witnesses confirm that 
fighting broke out almost the very moment the plane exploded 
leads us to think that this was an organized operation. 
However, here again, it appears impossible to know who really 
started hostilities. Jeanne, the eldest daughter of President 
Habyarimana, said: "The instant the plane crashed, we were 
opened fire upon. The shots were coming from the hills occupied 
by the RPF. During the night, we learned that the fighting was 
intensifying. First of all in Kigali, and then throughout the 
country." It has also been established that after the attack, 
the soldiers of the presidential guard carried out savage 
reprisals in the Rwandan capital against not only the Tutsi 
population, but also against the Hutu opposition, as if to 
better prove that the civil war ravaging the country could not 
be summed up as an ethnic conflict. While shots were ringing 
through the town, the official Rwandan army had a statement read 
on the national radio station calling for the people to support 
it in its struggle against the "criminals" and denouncing the 
exactions of angry soldiers following the assassination of the 
president. 
<H5>  Six Frenchmen Killed in Kigali </H5>
  It was at this time, too, that two French gendarmes -- 
Deputy 
Chiefs Rene Maier and Alain Didot -- and the latter's wife were 
killed. Members of the military aid mission to Rwanda since 
1993, the two noncommissioned officers and Mrs. Didot, shot and 
hacked to death by machetes, were summarily buried in the garden 
of their villa. That is where the Blue Helmets discovered them 
on 13 April. Their bodies were met in Le Bourget on 15 April by 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard and Cooperation Minister 
Michel Roussin. The latter's staff said that "their death was 
not linked to their job (one of them was a communications 
specialist -- LE MONDE editor's note), but to their residence 
and to the fact that they were said to be hiding Tutsis in their 
house." It must therefore be understood that the three French 
nationals were supposedly victims of Hutu militiamen or the 
presidential guard. Their house, however, was located in the 
Kanombe area, which was already under RPF control. The news of 
their death -- which was known to the French Embassy in Kigali 
by 8 April, as attested to by a memo sent to Paris by telex at 
1900 -- was only made public three days later. Curiously, the 
death certificate, dated 6 April, says that it was an 
"accidental death." 
  No less curious is the fact that the JOURNAL OFFICIEL of 14 
June, which published the appointment to the rank of "Knight of 
the Legion of Honor" for the three crew members of the Rwandan 
airplane -- the pilot, Jacquy Heraud, his copilot, Jean-Pierre 
Minaberry, and the mechanic, Jean-Michel Perrine -- put their 
date of death at 7 April, whereas the airplane crashed the night 
before, and without anyone knowing whether this was simply a 
transcription error. Recruited within the framework of the 
cooperation effort to fly the airplane offered by France to 
Rwanda in 1989, the three crew members, at least one of whom 
used to be with the GLAM [Ministerial Air Liaison Group], were 
rapidly hired by a rather shadowy Paris-based company, SATIF 
(Service and Assistance in French Industrial Technologies), 
which, according to its general manager, is a "company which 
provides services in the aeronautics and electronics sectors." 
It has contracts with, among others, the Cooperation Ministry 
"with the skill and discretion that this requires." Maintaining 
the Falcon 50 crews cost around 3 million French francs per 
year. Surely it would have been better to go through a 
"friendly" company, so that the cost would not be borne by 
French financiers. This hypothesis has been put forward by 
several sources, who suggest that in the past the company has 
already provided other discreet services on behalf of 
cooperation. 
  "We are not a company working unofficially for the 
Cooperation Ministry," the SATIF official told us, although he 
had not been asked if that was the case. Michel Roussin's staff 
admits that it has been in "financial contact" with the company, 
which seems to have been replaced by a limited liability company 
called ASI (Aeroservices International), which, although 
dissolved on 30 June 1992, still appears to be active, even 
though it has never met its legal obligation to submit its 
accounts to the Commercial Court. "We have nothing to hide," the 
same interlocutor explained. "Our customers are aware of 
everything we do, but we do not like people sticking their noses 
into our affairs. This is not the United States!" During the 
same interview, he assured us last week that the airplane did 
not have a black box. 
<H5>  Pilot's Last Words </H5>
  The Falcon 50 -- a symbol of France's preferred relations, 
which are now widely disputed -- was purchased second-hand and 
then given to President Habyarimana to replace an aging 
Caravelle under conditions which would have nothing to gain by 
being held up to the light. The negotiations were led by an 
eminent member of Francois Mitterrand's staff, assisted by a man 
from the "Elysee cell." The middleman chosen by the Rwandan 
head of state was Dr. Bele Calo, an African born in Belgium, who 
has had several brushes with the police for confidence trickery 
and fraud in the early eighties. Said to be close to the former 
Rwandan ambassador to France, Denis Magirimana, who was supposed 
to have been dismissed for embezzlement of public funds, this 
dubious figure is said to have left France for Uganda, and 
nothing further has been heard of him. 
  On 6 April, at around 2030, it was this airplane, carrying 
the Rwandan and Burundian heads of state, which crashed after 
being hit by two projectiles, most likely two Soviet-built SAM-7 
missiles. According to our information, the two missile 
launchers were found on the Masaka hill, from which the firing 
came, in the heart of the RPF zone, and are now said to be in 
the hands of the Rwandan defense minister. The airplane was 
carrying the two presidents from Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), where 
a summit on the situation in Burundi had just been held. 
Several heads of state from this part of Africa who had said 
that they would be participating in the meeting, ended up 
canceling. These included Marshall Mobutu, president of Zaire, 
with whom Juvenal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira had dined 
the night before in Kinshasa, but who decided at the last minute 
not to go to Tanzania. 
  Since the Burundian president's airplane had broken down, 
Mr. 
Habyarimana suggested taking him home, in accordance with the 
African custom of "airplane taxis." Having left Dar es Salaam 
at 1850, the Falcon was supposed to touch down in Kigali in the 
early evening, and then go on to the Burundian capital of 
Bujumbura to drop off its passenger, and finally return to 
Kigali, where the airport was still being guarded by Belgian 
troops working under UNAMIR (UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda). 
  As it was approaching the runway, military sources say that 
the copilot's wife heard the final dialogue between the airplane 
and the control tower: Her husband had told her the frequency 
on which she could receive the airplane communications during 
the approach phase on an ordinary radio. 
  So, before losing contact and several minutes before the 
explosion, she is said to have heard the control tower ask the 
pilot several times about the presence on board the plane of the 
Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira. Are we to deduce from 
this that the latter was the target, that they wanted to kill 
two birds with one stone, or, on the contrary, that the 
conspirators were trying to spare him? An examination of the 
black box might be able to say. 
  There is another unanswered question: Is the death of the 
two French gendarmes at their villa in Kanombe, located exactly 
along the same axis as the Kigali runway, related to the attack? 
Did they witness it, and were they therefore silenced because 
of it? Even an official inquiry has little chance of 
determining that. 
  Many witnesses, both civilian and military, who have 
frequented the Rwandan capital since the beginning of the year, 
have said: "We had the feeling that something was brewing." 
One of President Habyarimana's nephews said that during a phone 
conversation one week before his death, he told his uncle that 
there were rumors of a coup. The reply was: "We know about 
it." The wife and children of the Rwandan leader recall a 
conversation on Easter Sunday -- three days before the tragedy 
-- with an African diplomat bearing a message from Paul Kagame, 
the military leader of the RPF: "You must know that he will do 
everything in his power to kill you, even if it means gambling 
his own life." 
  A few hours after his death, the presidential clan clearly 
pointed the finger at the RPF and its alleged accomplices. "The 
Rwandan Government will shortly launch an inquiry in order to 
shed some light on the responsibilities of the Belgian Blue 
Helmets suspected by Rwandan public opinion of being involved in 
the plot to assassinate the head of state," wrote the Rwandan 
Foreign Ministry in the above mentioned memo dated 15 April 
which it sent to its diplomatic missions abroad. Before 
indicating, more cautiously, in the same document that, while 
awaiting the expert report on the celebrated black box (which is 
today in the hands of former gendarme Paul Barril), "it would be 
risky to draw a definitive conclusion as to the perpetrators of 
the attack which took the life of President Habyarimana." 
Almost three months after the event, this is still -- 
unfortunately -- the accepted conclusion in the midst of the 
Rwandan chaos.

  [Text] Zairians are still expecting Prime Minister Leon 
Kengo Wa Dondo to form the ninth transitional government. 
Yesterday, the prime minister called for greater responsibility 
from the conclave's political forces and the Sacred Union of the 
Radical Opposition and Allies. He asked them to submit to him 
all their proposals for the formation of the new government by 
1100 GMT today at the latest. As demanded by Article 78, 
paragraph 5, of the transition constitution, the prime minister 
must propose the list of the cabinet members for appointment to 
the president of the Republic tomorrow. Furthermore, transfer 
of authority between the outgoing and incoming ministers is 
supposed to take place on 30 June. The first cabinet meeting, 
which will be held on 1 July, will mainly examine the prime 
minister's policy speech.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Three people were 
reportedly shot dead in Mbuji-Mayi, in the central Zairian 
Kasai-Oriental Region, during a shoot-out at an opposition 
meeting, an authoritative source disclosed in Kinshasa today. 
Communication Minister Ngongo Luwowo, who was questioned by 
AFP, denied the report, however. 
  According to a pro-opposition newspaper quoting the Union 
for 
Democracy and Social Progress [UDPS] leadership in the Zairian 
capital, 12 others were also wounded seriously in the shoot-out 
in which the Army was reportedly involved. 
  The newspaper added that the incident occurred while Lambert 
Mende, an UDPS official, was holding a news briefing at the UDPS 
headquarters in Mbuji-Mayi, the country's diamond capital. Mr. 
Mende was reportedly abducted with his aides. According to an 
independent source, Mr. Mende was released shortly after he 
being picked up for interrogation.

  [Text] A rumor gave the impression that some incidents had 
occurred at Mbuji-Mayi, claiming three lives and leaving several 
people injured. After checking with all the civilian and 
military authorities, Tele-Zaire has been able to establish the 
facts. Having gone to the area from Kinshasa, Mr. Lambert Mende, 
chairman of one of the wings of the Congolese National Movement 
[MNC]- Lumumba, began to incite the local population to attack 
the interests of so-called pro-government firms and French 
interests. Reacting to this call to hatred and violence, Western 
Kasai Governor (Bachala Kamtua Milandu) called Mr. Mende to 
order, asking him to put an end to all forms of agitation. Mr. 
Mende promised not do that any more and said he was simply going 
to visit his family at Mwene Ditu. On reaching the area, 
however, he started all over again. He was never kidnapped and 
should, in principle, have returned to Mbuji-Mayi today. 
  Also, in a release to the press passed on to us only a few 
minutes before we entered the studios, sources close to the 
National Intelligence and Security Service say that according to 
their information a peaceful atmosphere reigns at Mbuju-Mayi, 
chief town of the Western Kasai Region, where Mr. (Mende 
Omalanga), an influential Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] 
member, freely held a public debate. The said sources say the 
man is continuing his tour of the Western Kasai Region smoothly 
without harassment. This release categorically denies reports 
carried today in certain newspapers in Kinshasa alleging bloody 
incidents which, they claim, took place at Mbuji-Mayi between 
security forces and USOR fighters.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Soon after news on his [Dr. 
Frederick Masinde's] death was broken, FORD [Forum for the 
Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya top officials called for a 
judicial inquiry into the death. The party top brass, led by 
the second vice chairman Professor Rashid Mzee, said they were 
not satisfied with the explanation given by police about the 
accident. "We therefore call for an independent judicial 
inquiry to be constituted urgently," they said at a hastily 
called press conference at parliament buildings last night. 
They said they were dissatisfied with the police explanation 
because of the urgency with which the scene of the accident was 
cleaned up. They claimed blood stains were washed away from the 
scene 15 minutes after the accident occurred. Professor Mzee, 
who read the statement on behalf of his colleagues, said Dr. 
Masinde died at 2:30 PM at Nairobi Hospital. [passage omitted] 
  Last night, one NATION reader who works at the Nairobi

  [Text] A spokesman for the United Somali Congress-Somali 
Salvation Alliance [USC-SSA] announced today that the fighting 
provoked by the Somali National Alliance [SNA] in violation of 
peace agreements, is still going on in Mogadishu and that the 
SNA has continued to strengthen its attacks especially in Makka 
and Madina districts in Mogadishu. 
  He said that USC-SSA forces are courageously facing the 
SNA's 
antipeace provocations. The spokesman said: We have in 
principle endeavored and are ready to halt the fighting in which 
Somali blood is being shed but the SNA leader, Aidid, is 
adamant. It is therefore right for us to defend our lives, 
property, principles, and generally the security and unity of 
the Somali people, the spokesman added, particularly since the 
SNA forces are planning new attacks in the rest of Mogadishu in 
the near future. The spokesman termed as far-fetched and untrue 
reports released by the BBC and those carrying white flags while 
actually serving Aidid to the effect that peace has been reached 
and that the fighting has ended. In conclusion, the spokesman 
explained that the fighting in Mogadishu is not based on clans 
but is being fought between the USC-SSA and small SNA groups. 
He pointed out that nobody will gain from resorting to clan 
loyalties.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] The mediator's document on the implementation of 
modalities for national reconciliation has already been 
presented to the negotiating teams of the government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
Today, the teams examined the document that provides for 
UNITA's participation in the government of national unity. 
There was no session today, which was nevertheless 
characterized by intense diplomatic activity. 
  Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN 
secretary general in Angola and mediator in the peace talks, was 
today received by Zambian head of state Frederick Chiluba, whom 
he briefed on the present situation of the peace talks and 
requested political and moral assistance with a view to finding 
a quick solution for the peace talks. 
  The extra-parliamentary group led by Miguel Mwendo was today 
received by the government negotiating team and Alioune Blondin 
Beye. The group, led by the leader of the National Union for 
the Beacon of Democracy and Development of Angola, includes the 
president and deputy president of the Angolan Socialist Party. 
It has already been received by Ambassador (Rocha Pares), 
representing the troika of observers in the Angolan peace 
process, and they gave him a proposal for the establishment of 
peace in Angola. 
  Not until tomorrow will we know whether the negotiating 
teams 
of the government and UNITA will discuss Jonas Savimbi's special 
status, within the framework of national reconciliation. The 
government and UNITA were expected to discuss this issue 
tomorrow. According to some political observers, it is extremely 
risky to accept UNITA's request, but it is only though talking 
that men can understand each other. The government and UNITA 
know what they are doing to reestablish peace in Angola.

  [Text] Cape Town June 28 SAPA -- The South African National 
Defence Force [SANDF] had made contingency plans for armed 
intervention in Lesotho and was waiting to be given 
instructions, minister of defence Mr Joe Modise said on Tuesday 
[28 June]. He told a press conference that the SANDF had 
contingency plans for all southern African flashpoints in case 
it was required to move in. 
  There had been increasing concern among the Frontline States 
over events in Lesotho, where dissident police and army factions 
have been responsible for continuing armed disruption and 
killings. 
  Earlier this month President Nelson Mandela expressed fears 
that the unrest could have en effect on South Africa.

  [Text] Senate June 28 SAPA -- South Africa should 
concentrate on its own problems rather than send troops to 
strife-torn Rwanda, minister of defence Mr Joe Modise said on 
Tuesday [28 June]. Replying in question time he said it was not 
the government's intention to send combat troops or support 
personnel to the Central African nation. 
  It was however committed to supporting all mediation and 
other efforts by the international community to ensure a 
peaceful and lasting solution there. 
  It would donate emergency supplies specified by the United 
Nations, was negotiating with the UN on the possible lease of 
troop carriers for use by UN personnel, and was considering 
airlifting material collected in South Africa by the Rhema 
church. 
  Asked by Senator E K Moorcroft (DP) [Democratic Party] 
whether he would be prepared to reconsider the issue if the 
genocide continued in Rwanda, Mr Modise said South Africa should 
concentrate on its own problems at home. "We think the Rwandan 
situation is taken care of by forces coming from the United 
Nations and at present there are French forces there....We have 
to address the problems at home first."

  [Text] Cape Town June 28 SAPA -- The chief of staff of 
Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing], 
Siphiwe Nyanda, has been appointed acting chief of staff of the 
South African National Defence Force [SANDF] with the rank of 
lieutenant-general. He is one of nine senior MK officers whose 
placement in top positions in the integrated SANDF were 
announced by Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise on Tuesday [28 
June]. 
  He said the curriculum vitae of officers from the PAC's 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's 
Liberation Army], were still being examined, and that the SANDF 
placement board would decide on where they should be 
accommodated. 
  The former chief of the Transkei Defence Force, Major 
General 
T T Matanzima, had been appointed general officer commanding 
Eastern Province, with the same rank. 
  Other appointments were (SANDF ranks): chief of Service 
Brigade: Lieut-Gen Lambert Moloi; chief of personnel SANDF 
headquarters: Major-Gen Andrew Masondo; chief of Army Staff: 
Maj-Gen J Tshali; chief director of logistics SANDF 
headquarters: Maj-Gen A Ismail; deputy chief of staff 
intelligence: Maj-Gen P Tshikare; commander of SA [South 
African] Army Command: Maj-Gen N Ngwenya; director inspections 
with special responsibility for human resources and women's 
rights: Brigadier J Molefe. 
  Brigadier M Motau had been assigned to military 
intelligence. 
  Mr Modise said the men were MK stalwarts who had held 
command 
for many years. Their ranks were based on their experience and 
their contribution to the democratic transformation in South 
Africa. 
  Mr Modise also confirmed the positions of the present chiefs 
of the Army, Air Force and Navy, Lieut-Gen J H Pretorius, 
Lieut-Gen J Kriel and Vice Admiral R C Simpson. 
  Other appointments -- including chief of staff intelligence 
-- would be made as the integration process proceeded. 
  Mr Modise said Gen Nyanda's appointment would be made 
permanent after he had completed a training course over the next 
three years or so. There had been bitter complaints from the 
public and within the defence force about the standards of the 
non-statutory forces, and the SANDF was "accommodating these 
complaints". 
  "We are going to empower our people to enable them to hold 
these jobs and acquit themselves in a manner in which we would 
like them to acquit themselves," he said. 
  Chief of the SANDF General Georg Meiring said he was "quite 
happy" with the appointments. 
  He expected the personnel of the SANDF to swell to about 
120,000 over the next year with the incorporation of the 
homeland and non- statutory forces. This would then be 
rationalised over a period of three years back to the present 
"affordable" 91,000. 
  Asked about the former head of the National Peacekeeping 
Force [NPKF], Brig Gabriel Ramushwana, Mr Modise said the senior 
appointments announced on Tuesday were not all those that had to 
be filled. "So when we reach him a decision will be taken and an 
announcement made," he said. 
  The now-disbanded NPKF had been worth it in the sense that 
it 
was meant for a good cause. "They never had a chance really," he 
said. "It was originally planned to train them for nine months, 
but in effect they were trained for eight weeks." 
  The issue of MK members being turned away when they tried to 
join the SANDF was a very serious one. The lists that had been 
drawn up as stipulated in the constitution would be looked at 
again. "Constitutionally there was a cutoff date, but we are 
doing everything we can to bring them in."

  [Text] Parliament June 29 SAPA -- The intelligence budget 
component of the Special Defence Account [SDA] was split between 
obtaining intelligence on weapons smuggling, 
counter-intelligence and intelligence operations outside South 
Africa, chief of the South African National Defence Force 
[SANDF] Gen Georg Meiring said on Wednesday [28 June]. 
  Addressing the joint standing committee on finance, he said 
R37 million [rand] of the R3.093 billion Special Defence Account 
was earmarked for intelligence projects. The remainder of the 
SDA was allocated to capital expenditure and non-project related 
expenditure such as ammunition, weapons, missiles, vehicles, 
spares and repairs. 
  The SDA was subject to more stringent control than the rest 
of the defence budget. Any expenditure had to be authorised by 
both the ministers of defence and finance. The ministers also 
had to individually authorise spending on intelligence projects. 
  R297 million had been cut from the SDA for re-allocation to 
the Reconstruction and Development Programme in the current 
financial year. He offered the joint committee a detailed 
briefing on the manner in which the SANDF determined its 
strategic threat analysis which forms the basis for its 
budgeting. Chairperson Jill Marcus accepted the offer on behalf 
of the committee.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  More Transparent Intelligence System -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR 
in English on 29 June in a page-18 editorial finds that "sadly" 
the country does need the 400 million rand budgeted for the 
National Intelligence Service (NIS). NIS Chief Mike Louw makes 
a case for this budget: "Violent endeavour on the political 
fringes, while happily dormant, is by no means buried. 
America's spy system is closing 13 missions in Africa, perhaps 
to consolidate their efforts from a single SA base. Organised 
crime is both growing and is overlapping with the political 
arena. Clandestine combat in the economic and technological 
fields is overtaking the old simple James Bond issues." 
Furthermore, "From what little we know of disruptive intentions 
on and around April 27, it seems that without the intelligence 
community we may today have been embroiled in something close to 
a civil war rather than basking in the joyous birth of a new 
nation." However, "what we can demand is an intelligently 
transparent intelligence system. Towards that, we make an 
unexpected start with Louw's testimony. A new parliamentary 
committee on intelligence will soon take it further. We trust 
that equivalent information will come to light regarding the ANC 
and former homeland services that are now part of the expanded 
NIS." 
  Kasrils Appointment Undesirable -- A second editorial on the 
same page believes Ronnie Kasrils' appointment as deputy defense 
minister "is neither necessary nor desirable." The paper points 
to the "irresponsible role he played in the events leading up to 
the Bisho massacre of September 1992. Moreover, the key police 
ministry is already under the control of a communist, Sidney 
Mufamadi. The appointment of another, Kasrils, as the number 
two man at Defence could perturb a good few people at home and 
abroad who still remember old-style communist security 
machinations." 
<H5>  BUSINESS DAY </H5>
  Secret Services Accountable to Parliament -- "One of the 
more 
challenging tasks for the new South African administration is to 
establish a network of spies which behaves decently and does not 
impinge on the rights of law-abiding citizens," begins 
Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 June in a page-6 
editorial. "At the head of the network would probably be 
someone like National Intelligence Services director-general 
Mike Louw, who had the unusual experience this week of appearing 
before a public hearing to explain why his service should be 
given a budget of more than R400m [rand]." BUSINESS DAY 
believes governments cannot get by without intelligence 
services, however, "the important thing is that secret services 
should be accountable to Parliament rather than to the executive 
of government, which would soon be tempted to get involved in 
the intrigue, and start justifying secret funds and all the 
excesses that go with them."

  [Text] The National Constitutional Conference has adjourned 
sitting until the 11th of next month following some logistic 
problems. Our correspondent covering the deliberations in 
Abuja reports that although there was no mention of the 
problems, this might not be unconnected with lack of necessary 
documents for the assignment. 
  Delegates to the conference had earlier this morning at 
their 
sitting deplored the situation where many of them were not 
provided with the agenda and other necessary documents for the 
conference. The delegates also want the conference to be 
provided with standing orders that will govern proceedings or 
deliberations as well as business committees to look into the 
agenda to enhance easy deliberation on issues. 
  Meanwhile, there has been a reshuffle at the National 
Constitutional Conference Commission. A statement from the 
commission announced the appointment of new chairmen to head 
various subcommittees. They include the constitutional drafting 
and documentation committee to be headed by Dr. Beshir Ahmed 
Ikara, Alhaji Shehu Malami for finance and administration, and 
the general purpose committee will now be headed by Dr. Tunji 
Otegbeye. The publicity committee will be chaired by the former 
civilian governor of Anambra State, Chief Jim Nwobodo. All 
appointments are with immediate effect.

  [Text] The 30-point agenda for the national constitutional 
conference has been published. It was drawn up by the national 
constitutional conference commission which based the agenda on 
the memoranda submitted to it. The first item on the agenda is 
on the philosophical foundation of the Nigerian state. It 
proposes four different terms for consideration by the 
conference. These include the philosophies of one united 
country or a unitary state, as well as a federation or 
confederation. 
  An analysis by the constitutional conference commission 
shows 
that 60 of the total memoranda received were in support of one 
united country, while 205 were in support of a federation. The 
philosophy of a confederation received the support of 43 
memoranda and only one memorandum was in support of a unitary 
government. Another point of the agenda concerns the political 
structure of the Nigerian state. The constitutional conference 
is to consider three different forms. One is a two-tiers system 
which has a central government and a local government without 
state administration, or a central government with state 
governments without local administrations. The second form is a 
three-tiers system like the present one in the country while the 
third proposal is a four-tiers system of central government, 
regional governments, state governments, and local governments.

  [Text] The National Constitutional Conference is to 
reconvene today after yesterday's adjournment. Members will 
spend the next few days analyzing the address by the head of 
state, General Sani Abacha. The conference adjourned sitting 
soon after members (?checked) into the conference. Inaugurating 
the conference, Gen. Abacha said that the tenure of power for 
the administration would be determined by the outcome of the 
National Constitutional Conference. State House correspondent, 
Ogie Ogbonnaya Ogie reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ogie] Gen. Abacha said that the 
clarification was necessary as a result of the debates and 
arguments which the tenure of office of the administration had 
generated in some quarters. 
  [Abacha] We are aware that it's neither in our personal 
interest nor that of the nation to perpetuate ourselves in 
power. [applause] Nothing could be further from our plans. It 
ought to be clear, according to the laws guiding politics that 
[words indistinct] political factors viewed from all quarters of 
national life, the most logical process will be activities 
leading to elections into the various tiers of government which 
the Constitutional Conference will recommend. [applause] 
  How do we now begin searching for an exit date when it is 
unclear what the Constitutional Conference would decide? The 
amount of time required to establish the framework for realizing 
the various decisions of the conference depends on the nature of 
those decisions. An attempt to fix a date totally without 
reference to the decisions of the conference will not only 
appear to jump the gun but will surely be seized upon by a fresh 
[word indistinct] of cynics to suggest the administration is 
teleguiding the conference. We are also not unmindful of the 
high price the last administration had to pay when it set dates 
and had to change them because of one exigency or the other. 
[applause] We wish to avoid that mistake and ask that our 
actions and commitment to the democratic process should speak 
for themselves. 
  [Ogie] In the 30-page inaugural address, the head of state 
also listed areas which the conference must properly examine and 
spell out its acceptable constitutional provisions to ensure 
fairness, justice, and equity as well as allay the fears of some 
ethnic groups who have been complaining of marginalization. 
  [Abacha] You have the mandate to deliberate upon the 
structure of the Nigerian nation and state and to work out the 
modalities for ensuring good governance, to provide for our 
people a system of government guaranteeing equal opportunities, 
the right to aspire to any public office irrespective of state 
of origin, ethnicity, or creed and thus engender a sense of 
belonging in all our citizenry. [applause] 
  Our 34 years of sovereign existence has been beset with a 
history of continuous political uncertainties. We have had 
crises of legitimacy, crises of succession, crises of authority, 
and crises of nationally acceptable leadership. Our country is 
today resolved to terminate this vicious circle of crises. 
  [Ogie] Gen. Abacha also advised the conference to critically 
examine the advantages and disadvantages of both the 
parliamentary and presidential systems of government and produce 
any terms of democratic government or recommend a system that 
will be consistent with the Nigerian culture, ethnic diversity, 
and other peculiar social systems to developing countries. The 
head of state also identified the judiciary, social services, 
state freedom, security agencies, and the economy as areas which 
the conference must give priority attention to in its 
deliberations. Gen. Abacha said it was a challenge for the 
conference to find solutions to military interventions in 
politics. 
  [Abacha] This conference has the crucial responsibility to 
examine why out of the nearly 34 years of our independence, 24 
years have been spent under military rule. It is clearly a 
manifest, not least among the Armed Forces themselves, that 
there is a great wealth of opinion that the cycle of military 
interventions be terminated. [applause] It has become imperative 
that [words indistinct] permanent, irrevocable, and binding 
arrangements will permanently end the coup culture in Nigerian 
politics. We will do all to identify and rectify the systematic 
[words indistinct] line rather than dwell on simplistic 
behavioral explanations if we are to make any sensible progress 
in this regard. 
  [Ogie] The inaugural ceremony attracted people in various 
walks of life. Service chiefs, members of the Transitional 
Ruling Council, ministers, state administrators, (?governors) 
and their families also witnessed the occasion. [end recording]

  [Text] Lagos, June 28 (AFP) -- Jailed Nigerian 
pro-democracy leader Moshood Abiola has fallen ill under 
mysterious circumstances, his daughter said Tuesday [28 June]. 
  Lola Abiola-Edewor told AFP she had received "an ugly 
report" 
about her father's health through a "secret message sent to the 
family by a reliable source." 
  "The unexplainable happened less than 24 hours after reports 
had it that he was hale and hearty," she said. 
  Abiola was arrested by Nigeria's military junta last 
Thursday 
after declaring himself president and commander in chief. He is 
widely believed to have won elections a year ago that the 
military annulled on grounds of fraud.

  [Text] The Senegalese opposition are continuing to agitate 
for the release of party leaders Abdoulaye Wade and Landing 
Savane. 
  Pressure has been building up since last week when two of 
Wade's colleagues, Mody Sy and Samuel Saar, went on hunger 
strike. They were detained in connection with the murder of the 
vice chairman of the Senegalese constitutional court, in the 
wake of last year's general elections which, Wade's party 
claims, were rigged. And today, there was trouble in Dakar when 
opposition supporters were banned from holding a rally. On the 
line, Chris Green asked Odile Bueret when happened: 
  [Begin recording] [Bueret] You see, early this morning, 
armored vehicles took place at strategic crossroads of the 
Senegalese capital. Although Dakar police headquarters had 
forbidden Abdoulaye Wade's party to demonstrate as planned, the 
Senegalese authorities are really traumatized by the bloody 
events on 16 February when six policemen were killed by 
demonstrators, so they decided to have the police forces 
positioned throughout Dakar. According to the Senegalese 
Democratic Party [PDS]'s spokesman, Ousmane Ngom, since the 
demonstration had not been authorized, the PDS sent several MP's 
at the party's headquarters to tell militants that the 
demonstration had been called off. In the meantime, says 
Ousmane Ngom, 20 people were arrested including three MP's and 
several people were hurt. 
  [Green] So, the MP's who were arrested had actually gone to 
try and stop the demonstration? 
  [Bueret] That is right. 
  [Green] Have you any information as to how the people got 
hurt. Was there fighting between the police and the 
demonstrators? 
  [Bueret] I do not think they actually fought with the 
police, 
it's just, you know, there were so many people to be arrested 
that things happened. 
  [Green] Do you know what happened to those who were 
arrested? 
  [Bueret] Not yet. It is very difficult to get information 
and I think the PDS party is likely to give a press conference 
in a few hours, so we will know more in a few hours time. 
  [Green] So, following today's events, what is the atmosphere 
like in Dakar tonight? 
  [Bueret] Everything is very calm, you know. You can see 
[words indistinct], you can see armored vehicles all around 
Dakar, not many but just at strategic points of the capital. 
The only thing is the whole opposition is planning a 
demonstration on Friday [1 July] and it wants to join with the 
students, the unions, and it could be a big demonstration. 
Probably, again, this demonstration will be forbidden by the 
authorities but as you can see, all of people in the Senegal are 
now ready to demonstrate against what is happening in Dakar and 
the political situation with the main opposition leaders being 
incarcerated for four to five months without being judged for 
what they have been arrested. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town -- National Intelligence Service (NIS) 
director-general Mike Louw make an unprecedented appearance at a 
public forum yesterday to argue for the continuation of his 
service, because of a huge increase in spying in SA [South 
Africa]. 
  Appearing before Parliament's joint standing committee on 
finance, Louw confessed to being nervous, acknowledging that 
some of the committee's members had been "intelligence targets" 
not too long ago. 
  One of the new parliamentarians, former trade unionist and 
ANC MP Phillip Dexter, asked whether "greater transparency" was 
not needed to reduce hostility to NIS because then "many of us 
wouldn't be so hostile to the idea of you getting any money at 
all." 
  Louw said: "I suppose that many of the people in this room 
have been intelligence targets of our organisation in the past." 
  But he recalled sitting in Parliament listening to an attack 
on the intelligence services by the leader of the opposition, 
who said NIS was spying on his party which was law abiding and 
had nothing to be ashamed of. Just a few weeks later it became 
known that members of that party had planted bombs. 
  It was wrong to think that there was no longer any political 
threat to the country. The right wing was "vociferous" and, 
although it seemed to be "a bit downtrodden and shocked by the 
election results," there were indications that it was 
regrouping. On the left of the political spectrum, many had 
great expectations and what their reaction would be when these 
expectations were not met was uncertain. 
  Louw said the number of foreign missions had grown by 160 
percent since 1990 and foreign intelligence personnel had 
increased 182 percent. 
  The CIA had indicated it intended closing 13 of its missions 
in Africa. "I can only surmise that those 13 missions will be 
run from SA. I have very little doubt about that. It is just 
another thing to take cognisance of." 
  He said no decision had been taken on how NIS, the 
intelligence arms of the liberation movements and those of the 
former homelands, might be integrated. A special Cabinet 
committee was currently considering the matter. 
  Louw also said organised crime was increasingly the terrain 
of intelligence services because of the link between crime, 
terrorism and drugs. 
  Asked about the future of NIS, he said the organisation had 
tried for many years to recruit people from communities other 
than the Afrikaaner community with very little success. Despite 
a drive to recruit from many universities, including black 
campuses, NIS had found that many people did not want to join 
"simply because of the bad image we had as an instrument of 
state." 
  Rather than looking at NIS's past activities, the focus 
should be on the future and the need to ensure a "common 
intelligence" in a country which could look forward to an 
intelligence service "at peace with itself."

  [Text] Conakry, June 29 (AFP) -- Guinea is to send a 
"military contingent" to reinforce the United Nations Mission to 
Rwanda toward the end of next month, the Guinean foreign 
ministry disclosed late Tuesday [28 June]. 
  A ministry statement said Guinea was preparing "to take part 
in humanitarian actions under the aegis of the United Nations by 
sending a military contingent there." Some 5,500 UN troops are 
expected in war-ravaged Rwanda by the end of July. 
  The ministry added Conakry understood the need for the 
French-led Operation Turquoise humanitarian mission and wished 
to underline its "concern in the face of general genocide" being 
practised between rival Rwandan ethnic factions. Guinean forces 
are already engaged in UN peacekeeping missions in Liberia, 
Sierra Leone and Western Sahara.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], has told the MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY, 
AIM, that he could ask for the UN Security Council to intervene 
if the General Peace Accord's Supervision and Control Commission 
[CSC] does not resolve the problems allegedly arising from the 
preparations of the October elections. 
  AIM cites Dhlakama as saying the Mozambique Liberation Front 
[Frelimo] is already involved in fraud, and his organization is 
worried about and will refer the matter to the CSC. Dhlakama 
added if the CSC cannot resolve the problem, Renamo will write 
to the Security Council asking it to deal with the matter. The 
Renamo leader alleged that fraud began when electoral 
registration teams included Frelimo Party members instead of 
ordinary Mozambicans as had been planned. Dhlakama also accused 
the government of not providing food to members of the 
opposition parties monitoring the registration of voters. 
  Meanwhile, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana says Dhlakama's 
accusations are worrisome because they cast serious doubts over 
the National Elections Commission's role. 
  Jose Estevao Muchine, director of the Elections 
Administration Technical Secretariat, said Dhlakama is not 
telling the truth. Muchine said electoral arrangements are being 
jointly made with Renamo and other party officials, adding that 
the Secretariat has never received reports of such allegations.

  [Text] As you know, France has become involved in the 
Rwandan conflict, with Senegalese soldiers as their sole de 
facto African ally on the ground. On the occasion of the 
meeting of the franc zone countries in Gabon, a broader stance 
was expected from francophone African countries. Stephane 
Manier and Philippe Josselin report: 
  [Mannier] The 14 francophone African heads of state support 
France in Rwanda. They approved the humanitarian intervention 
in order to please Paris, whose greatest fear was that it would 
remain isolated. There is relief even if some reservations have 
slipped in behind this apparent unanimity. The final 
communique, for instance, uses generalities to approve the 
intervention and insists on the authority of the United Nations 
as a framework for any African participation. Does African 
participation necessarily mean sending in military troops? 
  [Begin recording] [President Pascal Lissouba] In order to 
support the efforts currently under way, yes. 
  [Mannier] In what framework will these troops be involved? 
  [Lissouba] In whatever framework. Everything is now 
supported by the United Nations. [end recording] 
  [Mannier] In any case, this will take a long time to 
implement, not only because the logistics of this participation 
must be finalized--and this is never simple in Africa--but 
mainly because it is important to know who will pay: 
  [Begin Lissouba recording] My country is wrestling with 
major 
difficulties and we do not have means of transport, we do not 
have any equipment, we do not have the necessary logistics for 
that, so we are waiting for the United Nations to show 
willingness to help us, the United Nations or other countries, 
France for instance. [end recording] 
  [Mannier] In fact, this is fair enough since this Libreville 
summit was theoretically devoted to monetary issues and to the 
aftermath of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc 
devaluation. The francophone African countries pointed out 
that, if Paris wanted to be helped, it had to show understanding 
toward Africa. The message seems to have been received. This 
is the way the best friendships are reinforced.

causes of insecurity. 
  Concluding, Ali Mohamed Ugas Ali stressed that Somalis in 
general, and those in Mogadishu in particular, should be extra 
alert to the traps being laid by those wishing to start 
senseless fighting. He added that efforts should be made 
towards healing the wounds of the past.

  [Text] The French ambassador to Uganda, Mr. (Francois 
Descoyet), has held a press conference at the French Embassy in 
Kampala to clarify on a number of issues concerning his 
country's presence in Rwanda. Mr. (Descoyet) categorically 
stated that French operations in Rwanda are strictly 
humanitarian, and have nothing to do with military or political 
interference in Rwanda's affairs. He told the press that 
France's operations in Rwanda are a fulfillment of a United 
Nations Security Council resolution, passed on 22nd June, which 
warrants those operations. 
  Mr. (Descoyet) reiterated his country's stand on Rwanda's 
affairs, that it is the rule of the United Nations and Africa to 
mediate between the warring parties, not France. He 
categorically refuted press reports that France has interests in 
Rwanda and is taking sides, emphasizing that theirs is purely to 
safeguard the innocent threatened civilians by war, which work 
it is doing very well. 
  He also refuted allegations that his country trained the 
Rwandese Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy 
and Development, MRND, militia] who are accused of constant 
violation of human rights in Rwanda. He said France has a 
written cooperation with Rwanda like it is doing with other 
African countries, but when incidents of violation of human 
rights continued, this cooperation was reduced to nothing. He 
refuted allegations that his country has been aiding the Rwanda 
interim government.

  [Text] An orchestrated propaganda scheme being developed in 
Monrovia by a gang of Communist-minded individuals, to divert 
international attention and counter continued calls by former 
President Taylor for the total and unconditional withdrawal of 
the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and move towards the 
establishment of a national army, has been exposed. A series of 
[word indistinct] activities, with the backing of the local BBC 
correspondent -- who is an ECOMOG paid agent in Monrovia -- sent 
panicky waves of fear in Monrovia and elsewhere of an imminent 
war, despite calls for the cessation of all hostilities in the 
country. The exposure of the Nigerian complicity in aiding and 
abetting splinter armed groups in Liberia, particularly, the 
Liberian Peace Council and one of ULIMO's [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] factions, has led to harsh 
international criticisms and demands by local interest and 
pressure groups for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal 
of the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG from Liberia.

  [Text] The Ghanaian contingent of ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] 
has reportedly arrested several truckloads of arms and 
ammunition on the Monrovia- Buchanan Highway. According to the 
reports, the consignment of arms and ammunition was intended for 
the Liberian Peace Council [LPC], and was being escorted to 
Buchanan by the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG. This exposure by 
the Ghanaian contingent proves what the NPFL [National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia] and Africa Watch have revealed that the 
Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG is the sole supplier of arms and 
ammunition to the LPC in its onslaught against the Liberian 
people in southeast Liberia. 
  In a related development, military personnel of the NPFL 
recently intercepted large quantities of arms and ammunition 
from members of the LPC, which had been delivered by the 
Nigerian ECOMOG soldiers during late hours of the night.

  [Excerpt] The leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia] says while it welcomes the idea of the arms 
seizure exercise in Monrovia, it is questioning the motives 
behind the scheme. Recently, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] was reported to have 
raided the residence of ULIMO's [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia] leader, Alhaji Koromah, in Paynesville, 
Monrovia, claiming to have discovered large quantities of arms 
and ammunition and arresting several loyal supporters and 
soldiers of Alhaji Koromah. Similar exercise was also carried 
out by ECOMOG on the residence of breakaway ULIMO leader 
Roosevelt Johnson. 
  The leadership of the NPFL is wondering whether ECOMOG, 
which 
facilitated ULIMO in Monrovia all along as an armed group, did 
not know whether Alhaji Koromah had arms and ammunition in 
Monrovia. The leadership of the NPFL strongly warns that the 
action of ECOMOG is a bad precedent, which jeopardizes the 
security of leaders of warring factions under the Cotonou Peace 
Accord. The leadership of the NPFL stressed that the illegal 
arms raid on the living headquarters of both Koromah and Johnson 
by ECOMOG with AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] assistance is 
totally unacceptable. The NPFL leader, President Taylor, 
stressed that Liberia is not under martial law and the 
(?seizure) exercise in Monrovia by ECOMOG with AFL assistance is 
unacceptable. 
  [Begin Taylor recording] This exercise is unacceptable and 
must be stopped now. We wish to state, in no uncertain terms, 
that this nation is not under a military regime. We have no 
state of emergency (?imposed here). Therefore, we will not 
tolerate any such illegal seizure. Do you remember, fellow 
Liberians, the same old Samuel Doe soldiers who visited [words 
indistinct] and butchered innocent citizens, leaving behind 
mutilated bodies? Yes, they claimed then to be carrying out 
searches at that time. But the results were devastating, as 
thousands were murdered in cold blood. The memories of these 
actions are fresh in our minds. Do you want them back in your 
homes? Today they are coming again. Who knows what their real 
intents are? [end recording] 
  Former President Taylor cited the legal implications 
involved 
in the search and seizure exercise, noting that the action 
constitutes a violation of the constitutional rights of 
Liberians. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Internal Affairs Minister Samuel Dhokie, as part of 
his clandestine operation to launch an attack on positions of 
the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], is reported to 
have visited Guinea. Mr. Samuel Dhokie, according to reports, 
visited Guinea to seek cooperation from local Guinean 
authorities for the use of Guinean soil for his planned attack, 
under the guise of arranging the repatriation of Liberian 
refugees there. But he is reported to have been refused any 
cooperation from the Guinean Government. 
  The NPFL controversial nominee to the Liberian National 
Transitional Government, who cut short his trip to Guinea as a 
result of the refusal of authorities there to cooperate with 
him, visited many refugee camps seeking support for his 
so-called Nimba Defense Force. Observers are questioning the 
credibility of Minister Dhokie and his cohorts, accusing them of 
working contrary to the social peace of Liberia and their 
original organizations that nominated them. There are even 
calls for their replacement.

  [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] is 
calling for an immediate investigation within the State Council 
that some transitional ministers are planning an attack on NPFL 
positions. Recently, intelligence reports revealed that some 
LNTG [Liberia National Transition Government] ministers had a 
meeting in Guinea, in an attempt to destabilize the ongoing 
peace process. The report said these ministers are financing 
armed groups to attack Nimba and Bong counties from Guinea. The 
NPFL said any attack out of Guinea will meet with reciprocal 
action. 
  In a letter to Guinean President Lansana Conte, NPFL leader 
Charles Gankay Taylor urged him not to allow his territory to be 
used as a springboard for launching attacks on Liberia. He said 
any covert assistance by Guinea to armed groups attempting to 
derail the peace process in Liberia, will amount to a violation 
of international law and an encroachment on the territorial 
integrity of Liberia. President Taylor said the brotherly 
relations between Guinea and Liberia will continue, and a few 
power-seekers and unpatriotic citizens of Liberia should not be 
allowed to destroy the lives of peoples of the two countries.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
in Liberia] faction in Liberia, headed by Alhaji Koromah, seems 
to be heading for a confrontation with ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] 
forces. On Saturday [25 June] the two sides exchanged fire in a 
shoot-out in a suburb of Brewerville. ECOMOG say they were 
forced to shoot back in self-defense. Then on Sunday, a cache 
of weapons was seized from Koromah's house in a joint raid by 
ECOMOG and Liberian Defense Ministry forces. ULIMO were 
protesting strongly about the raid, and say they have been 
singled out unfairly, and today their military spokesman, Kales 
Dumbuya, phoned us up from Monrovia to complain. On the line, 
Josephine Hazely asked Mr. Dumbuya what they were unhappy about. 
  [Begin recording] [Dumbuya] The house of the national 
chairman is not something hidden; it is not somewhere hidden. 
We were rather surprised to see the ECOMOG going there to say 
that they are going to search. They once searched the place and 
the arms and ammunition that was there they were not hiding. 
They were open. The field commander has visited that area 
before with those arms there, so we were rather taken aback by 
the fact that they had to loot computers and money and other 
valuables from the house under the pretext that they have gone 
to search for arms. 
  [Hazely] Why did you have that quantity of arms and 
ammunition in the residence of Alhaji Koromah? 
  [Dumbuya] Those things are fallacies. They took only four 
arms from the chairman's residence, four arms with some 
ammunition that was to be used for the protection of the 
national chairman, a signatory to the Cotonou Accord. We were 
not.... 
  [Hazely, interrupting] They say, the ECOMOG says that these 
arms were being moved to destabilize Monrovia. 
  [Dumbuya] Josephine, that is another fallacy. That is 
fallacy to the large extent. There is nothing like moving on to 
Monrovia. We have kept these arms and ammunition for the 
protection of the national chairman. ECOMOG is aware of that. 
  [Hazely] If you say the arms and the ammunition were for the 
protection of your chairman, Alhaji Koromah, how come you had so 
many? According to ECOMOG, they said they have seized 26,000 
rounds of ammunition along with assault rifles, rocket propelled 
grenades and launchers, and communication sets. 
  [Dumbuya] Josephine, that is another fallacy as I said. 
There was a communication set that ECOMOG and everybody was 
aware of, because when we want to contact the front we go to 
that communication set and contact the front. So it was not 
hidden, as I said. The arms and ammunition that was there, they 
were overstated. They were overstated to make us look bad. 
ECOMOG is aware that arms and ammunition were there in the 
chairman's compound. They have gone there. They have seen 
armed men holding them -- the two squad [word indistinct] 
protecting the national chairman of an organization that is 
signatory to the accord here, for Heavens sake. So there is 
nothing like having anything under our sleeves to attack 
Monrovia. What are we going to attack, to do what? 
  [Hazely] But you realize also that the house of your 
chairman, Alhaji Koromah, was not the only one raided. Also 
they went to the home of Roosevelt Johnson. 
  [Dumbuya] That is another fallacy. There is nothing like 
searching Roosevelt Johnson's house, and even if they really 
went around there, they gave him enough chance to move his arms 
and ammunition. They just gave him chance to move these things 
in the barracks, so I mean, don't let them fool you, my sister.

  [Excerpts] In their attempt to escape justice for 
involvement in massacres at the Lutheran Church and the United 
Nations compound in Monrovia and the Harbel massacre in Marguibi 
County, the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL] and the Monrovia-based 
politicians of the former IGNU [Interim Government of National 
Unity] have embarked on a cover-up for AFL officials and certain 
ministers of the dissolved Sawyer government. The officials 
allegedly connected -- especially to the Harbel massacre -- 
include State Councilman Phillip Banks and former IGNU 
Information Minister Lamine Waritay, for presenting false 
evidence on the Harbel massacre. Former IGNU Foreign Minister 
Bacchus Matthews will also face trial for attaching a cover 
letter to the communications sent to the American State 
Department and Amnesty International on the Harbel massacres. 
  Former President Amos Sawyer, as the then AFL commander in 
chief, is to also have his share of the war crimes trial. As 
for the United Nations compound and the Lutheran Church 
massacres, Armed Forces of Liberia Chief of Staff Hezekiah 
Bowen, Charles Julue, (Edward Slanger), (Moses Wright), and 
several other key elements within the Monrovia AFL and security 
network will be the ones to face trial. These massacres against 
innocent Liberian civilians by the Armed Forces of Liberia and 
the dissolved interim government of Amos Sawyer were reportedly 
carried out outside actual combat, which warrants their trial. 
Two former Nigerian ECOMOG commanders, Generals Joshua 
Dogonyaro and Adetunji Olurin, also form part of the massacre 
case in Liberia during the war crimes trial. 
  Meanwhile, the NPFL leader, Former President Taylor, has 
spelled out how ECOMOG, an alien military force, has been 
assisting the AFL and the Monrovia group in murdering Liberians 
in large numbers. 
  [Begin Taylor recording] [Word indistinct] ECOMOG (?without) 
ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] sent a 
murderous government here, and they must bear the full 
responsibility for the murder of our people. They must bear the 
responsibility for the murder of our people. [repeats sentence] 
We are not talking about recrimination. Acts, wrongful acts, 
have been committed by all sides throughout the crisis. We are 
not talking about witch-hunting, paying back, but we have known 
for several years individuals that are walking the streets of 
Monrovia that individual Liberians can identify as having slain 
their mothers, their fathers, their brothers -- beheaded them. 
Why should these people continue to walk? These are sick minds 
and must be extracted from society. They must be. People can 
identify who murdered Van Richards, people can identify who 
beheaded [name indistinct], people can identify who shot at the 
Lutheran Church. We are not talking about witch-hunting here. 
We are talking about blatant, calculated, premeditated murder. 
[end recording] 
  The NPFL leader said that various atrocities in Liberia were 
carried out with the pre-disposition of blaming them on the 
NPFL. He spoke of the need for action against those involved in 
the wailful murders of Liberians. 
  [Begin Taylor recording] [passage omitted] All of those that 
are responsible must present themselves to be arrested, and we 
are calling upon the United Nations to set up a special court to 
try these people. [end recording]

  [Text] The leader of the Liberian Peace Council, Dr. 
(George Boley), has been ordered to leave the BTC [Barclay 
Training Center] Military Barracks which is the home of the 
Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL]. The Ministry of National Defense 
action comes in the wake of overwhelming citizens' demand to rid 
Monrovia of rebel leaders. 
  In a press briefing yesterday, the assistant minister of 
national defense for public affairs, Colonel Alfred D. Dennis, 
told Information Minister Honorable Joe Mulbah that the 
appropriate instructions for Dr. (Boley) to leave the BTC have 
already been issued. Minister Dennis observed that the AFL has 
no intention of harboring any rebel leader, a situation which, 
he said, could undermine its neutrality as a national Army, 
  For his part, Information Minister Joe Mulbah said that he 
was deeply gratified by Minister Dennis' assurance that the AFL 
will remain neutral in the search for peace. He said the 
Liberia National Transitional Government will continue to 
support ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] in making Monrovia a city free of 
arms.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The movement towards peace in Liberia continues to 
be painfully slow. Since the outbreak of civil war almost four 
years ago, many thousands of people have died and inevitably as 
the man who began the insurrection against former President 
Samuel Doe, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
leader, Charles Taylor, has made no secret of his desire to take 
his place. Network's Cello Brooks has just visited Mr. Taylor's 
headquarters in Gbarnga. There, he asked him first why the 
people of Liberia should trust him with the leadership of their 
country. 
  [Begin recording] [Taylor] The Liberian people know very 
well 
that I will not sell out, that I will not kneel and bow to any 
nation, no matter how powerful, when it comes to the sovereign 
rights, liberties, and protection of the Liberian people. We 
started this revolution. We have the largest army in this 
country. We showed we have not blinked at the most powerful 
countries in this region. 
  [Brooks] What do you think are some of the qualities the 
Liberian people will look at to say: Oh yes, this man is the 
man? 
  [Taylor] We all need a leader that we can trust -- a leader 
who says that he can do something and do it. We do not need a 
puppet in this country. The Liberian people know very well that 
I will not sell out, that I will not kneel and bow to any 
nation, no matter how powerful, when it comes to the sovereign 
rights, liberties, and protection of the Liberian people. They 
need a strong leader, they do not need a little roach in this 
country. They need a man that has guts, a man that has 
credibility, a man that is strong, firm and I think that I have 
these qualities. And if Liberians make a mistake by putting 
someone who is incapable, after the crisis, of bringing all 
parties together, to reconcile the parties from a position of 
confidence and strength, that will be the biggest mistake this 
country could ever make and it would lead us probably back into 
conflict. They need someone they can trust; I think I am that 
person. 
  [Brooks] And so, are you really prepared to start up with 
the 
entire process, I mean, in terms of disarming, encamping, and 
demobilizing your men? 
  [Taylor] Well, why wouldn't I be prepared? We've said for 
months ...[pauses] do not let us forget here that we've advanced 
all or most of the initiatives so far from the Geneva meeting to 
the Cotonou meetings to recuse ourselves from the process to 
give peace a chance. We have unilaterally declared certain 
aspects of the peace process. We have always been ready, we've 
insisted on fair play, we are very glad that the United Nations 
is here, we are very glad that the expanded ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is 
here. We, however, regret that they have not entered our area, 
our controlled area, we hope they can move as quickly as 
possible. We have always hoped to move the peace forward. 
  [Brooks] Are you hoping to enter Monrovia in high spirits? 
  [Taylor] I expect to win a landslide victory in these 
general 
and presidential elections and my party, I expect, will lead 
with a majority in the parliament; and so I have no qualms about 
going to Monrovia. We will judge the safety factor [words 
indistinct] given the extent of hostilities and after that we 
will go in when we think and feel that it is right. [end

  [Text] Bamako, 27 Jun (PANA) -- A meeting between the 
Malian Government and representatives of the Tuareg rebels 
opened this morning at Tamanrasset (far south in Algeria), it 
was announced from official sources in Bamako. 
  This meeting, which is taking place under the mediation of 
Algeria, is expected to discuss the increased violence which has 
officially claimed in one month about 30 lives in the north of 
the country. 
  In Tamanrasset, the discussions will also be on the 
"National 
Peace Pact" signed in April 1992 between the Malian Government 
and the Tuareg rebels, whose implementation has already shown 
its limits on the ground. 
  This pact made for the integration of former Tuareg 
combatants into the regular Army, but after the integration 
several Tuareg combatants recently deserted the ranks of the 
Army after exchanging gunshots with the soldiers. 
  The Malian Government delegation to the meeting is led by 
Defense Minister Diocunda Traore, while that of the rebels is 
led by Zeidane Sid' Lamine of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of the Azawad, one of the four tendencies of the 
Malian Tuareg rebellion.

  [Text] Lagos, 29 Jun (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, who was 
detained for declaring himself president of the federation and 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces on 11 June, has been 
transferred by road from the extreme northeast to the extreme 
south of the country, a communique issued this afternoon by his 
daughter pointed out. 
  Mr. Abiola was arrested on 23 June at his Lagos residence. 
He was first taken to Kano in the north, followed by Gashua in 
the extreme northeast, and then to Damaturu also in the extreme 
northeast and back to Gashua, the communique signed by Ms. Lola 
Abiola-Edewor, elder daughter of the politician said. He has 
now been transferred by road from Gashua toward Rivers State in 
the south, a journey of more than 800 km. 
  The millionaire politician, who according to his family is 
now ill, made all these trips by road in less than 48 hours, the 
communique added. According to Ms. Abiola-Edewor, her father 
has been ill since he was detained and he has not been allowed 
to meet either his doctor or his lawyer or any member of his 
family. No official information has been given on Mr. Abiola's 
whereabouts. According to a close aide of Mr. Abiola, the 
politician was reportedly transferred to Lagos today, where he 
could appear in court on 30 June or 1 July.

  [Text] Lagos, June 29 (AFP) -- At least four delegates to a 
conference called by Nigeria's military regime to introduce 
democracy announced they were quitting, various sources said 
Wednesday [29 June] as a powerful union leader again threatened 
a strike if opposition leader Moshood Abiola remained imprisoned. 
  One of Abiola's daughters, Lola Abiola Edewor, told AFP late 
Tuesday that reliable sources told her Chief Abiola had suddenly 
and mysteriously fallen ill in the secret location where he has 
been held since June 23. 
  Three of the delegates -- Denis Inyang, Oladapo Fafowara, 
and 
Pascal Bafyau -- were among 96 figures chosen by the government 
to represent states at the meeting, which adjourned Tuesday just 
a day after it opened. 
  The fourth, Alhaji Yekini Alabi, was one of 272 delegates 
elected to represent 30 regions. He attended on behalf of the 
central state of Kawara. 
  Meanwhile Frank Kokori, general-secretary of the powerful 
Union of Nigerian Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, told AFP 
the union "is maintaining our ultimatum" to the government to 
turn over power to Abiola by July 4. 
  "We will go on strike from Monday, if the government does 
not 
comply," he added. 
  Abiola was arrested after he proclaimed himself president on 
the anniversary of the June 12 presidential election annulled by 
the military regime, which he is widely believed to have won. 
  The opposition, which denounced the conference as a farce, 
has called for the release of Abiola, who faces a possible life 
prison sentence for treason. 
  The meeting adjourned for two weeks Tuesday after delegates 
said they needed more time to examine the agenda. 
  Court officials Wednesday said Inyang, chairman of the 
Nigerian Students' Association, filed a complaint in the High 
Federal Court on Tuesday claiming that the government's choice 
of him to represent the eastern state of Akwa Ibom amounted to 
"assassination" of his reputation. 
  He demanded 50 million naira (2.2 million dollars) 
compensation for "defamation." 
  Two newspapers said Fafowara, formerly a career diplomat, 
released a statement saying he learned he had been chosen from 
press reports to represent the southwestern state of Osun. 
  He said he could not agree to being named by a military 
government to attend a conference which was not sovereign, at a 
time when leading figures such as Moshood Abiola had been thrown 
in prison. 
  His decision was reported by the GUARDIAN and VANGUARD 
newspapers. 
  "I cannot...claim the right to speak freely at conference 
when others, who are equally committed to reestablishing 
democracy in Nigeria are detained by the police," added 
Fafowara, who served as a Nigerian diplomat in Britain, the 
Netherlands and Turkey. 
  He added that he had resigned as general director of the 
Association of Nigerian Industrialists in 1992 because he 
opposed a non-democratic government. 
  Bafyau, chairman of the powerful Nigerian Trade Union 
Federation -- of which the oil-workers' union is a key member -- 
and picked by the government to represent the northeastern state 
of Adamawa, said Wednesday he had not attended the opening 
ceremonies Monday. 
  No one has seen him since then in Abuja, where the 
conference 
was held, according to an AFP correspondent there. 
  Newspaper reports quoted Alabi, the fourth delegate to quit, 
as saying he did so because of pressure from his advisors.

  [Text] Lagos, June 29 (AFP) -- Nigerian opposition leader 
Beko Ransome-Kuti, arrested on June 9 and charged with treason, 
has been freed on bail by the Federal High Court in Lagos, the 
opposition leader's aides said Wednesday [29 June]. 
  Ransome-Kuti, the president of the Campaign for Democracy, 
an 
umbrella group of 40 pro-democracy groups, was freed Tuesday 
after refusing an earlier bail offer linking his freedom to a 
promise to give up political activity. 
  No figure was given for the size of the bail required by the 
court. 
  The Campaign for Democracy is campaigning against the 
eight-month-old military regime of General Sani Abacha and 
called for a restoration of democracy in Nigeria. 
  Abacha came to power in November, five months after the 
Nigerian military cancelled the publication of the results of 
presidential elections widely thought to have shown businessman 
Moshood Abiola as the winner. 
  Abiola himself was arrested last week after on June 11 
declaring himself president and head of the Armed Forces. 
  Five members of the campaign group and a press photographer 
were beaten up and then detained by the police when they 
attended Ransome-Kuti's hearing Tuesday, Segun Jegede, one of 
the group's leaders, said. 
  Judge Babatunde Belgore ordered the court to be cleared 
after 
the incident, the Nigerian press agency NAN said. 
  Belgore was anxious to avoid the repetition of an earlier 
incident when a woman stripped off before the court to protest 
at the jailing of Abiola and Ransome-Kuti. 
  In south-west Nigeria, home region of both men, there is a 
tradition of women stripping off and bearing their backsides in 
protests.

<F P=106> ["Part one" of commentary by Abdulkarim Algese; from the "In </F>
Focus" program] 
  [Text] Contrary to propaganda in certain quarters, the 
national conference which has now opened in Abuja was never the 
creation of the Abacha regime. The original champions were the 
so-called Campaign for Democracy group, actively supported by a 
vocal section of the media. In an obvious attempt to meet their 
demands, the regime on coming to power made it one of their 
agenda. As the preparations for its take-off had gone far, 
those who originally called for it denounced it with the same 
force they called for it. Their complaint is that with the 
government nominating 96 of the 369 conference members, the 
exercise will not achieve the desired purpose. They are also of 
the opinion that since the conference has no sovereign powers, 
then it will amount to a wasteful effort participating in it. 
The participation of nominated members in a similar conference 
is consistent with precedence. 
  It was so during Obasanjo and Babangida. [sentence as heard] 
The complaint that the nominated members will be taking 
dictations from government cannot reasonably hold bearing in 
mind the national standing of those involved. No matter what 
else may be said of them, they are men and women who cannot be 
pushed around by anybody. Indeed, it is valid to say that they 
have added credibility to the conference and the sincerity of 
government. 
  On the question of sovereignty, the truth is that there can 
never be two sovereign powers in any state. Those of us who 
want to copy Zaire and Togo need to be told that the attempt 
failed in both countries. The constitutional nature of the 
conference is based on the fact that its deliberations will be 
incorporated into the Constitution. There was a new dimension 
to the position of Nadeco [National Democratic Coalition] 
members who called for the boycott of the conference. According 
to reports, they were said to have written a secret letter to 
government pleading that their members be nominated. This is 
the same Nadeco that launched a campaign of boycott of the 
conference now wishing to participate through the back door. 
  Some Nigerians can really be clever by half. They succeeded 
in dissuading some prominent and intelligent persons from 
certain parts of the country not to take part in the elections 
leading to the conference, while they were secretly pleading for 
nominations. It is a pity that such intelligent persons should 
easily be deceived. The atmosphere leading to the conference was 
one of zealous emotion, ethnocentricity, and beclouded 
objectivity. Never was excessive tribalism at its height and 
never was the relevance and importance of Nigerian nationhood so 
disgraced. 
  A nation is the lifeline of a people. It is their dignity 
and symbol of pride. Think of the early explorers and colonial 
administrators who lost their lives for the glory of their 
respective nations. A people without a nation are orphans. The 
Palestinians could tell the story better. A country is the most 
priceless commodity that people could have. 
  Those who want the disintegration of Nigeria should 
seriously 
reflect on what is currently happening in the former Soviet 
Union. Here was a country feared and respected and one of the 
most powerful in the world, strong enough to fight both Western 
Europe and mighty America. Alas, after its painful 
disintegration it has now become the errand servant of Europe 
and America. At the height of glory, the USSR dictated to the 
world. Today, it carries out American instructions. Its powers 
are no more, its glory gone to the winds, and its pride badly 
ridiculed. This is the price a disintegrated nation has to pay. 
  A tightly united country is honey, a dismembered one 
tasteless. The conference delegates have no reasons whatsoever 
to give us a shattered nation at the end of their deliberations. 
If indeed they are, then they should bear in mind that the 
masses of the people are for a united Nigeria. [sentence as 
heard] Besides, a certain level of integration was taking place 
so as to make a breakup unviable. In their deliberations the 
delegates must put aside their elitist tendencies and work in 
the interest of the greatest number. This is what the people 
expect of them. As what may be called the giants of Nigeria, 
the masses are full of confidence that their maturity, stand in 
the society, and self-esteem, will see them through a purposeful 
deliberation. 
  As members of the ruling class who at one time or the other 
presided over the affairs of the nation, they should put a lie 
to the popularly held view that they are part of our national 
problems, which is why they must conduct their deliberations in 
an atmosphere of maturity, understanding, and consideration. To 
take a rigid position on issues is unhelpful. Principled and 
considerate flexibility should be the strongest weapons. After 
all, the exercise is about dialogue and compromise.

  [Text] Details of the proposed summit between Nigeria and 
Cameroon to discuss the Bakassi peninsula have been formally 
presented to the Federal Government. The Togolese foreign 
minister, Mr. Boumbera Alassounouma, presented the proposals to 
the head of state, General Sani Abacha, yesterday in Abuja. 
  The summit is to be held in Lome at the instance of the 
Togolese Government. The Togolese envoy explained that the 
presentation was a follow-up to the discussion between Gen. Sani 
Abacha and President Paul Biya during the OAU summit in Tunis. 
The Togolese foreign minister expressed delight that Nigeria 
and Cameroon had accepted to meet in Lome to resolve their 
differences. 
  Responding, Gen. Abacha reaffirmed Nigeria's commitment to a 
peaceful resolution of the crisis. He directed the minister of 
foreign affairs, Alhaji Baba Gana Kingibe, to work out an 
acceptable date for the summit.

  [Excerpt] France is resuming cooperation with Togo. This 
was announced in Paris this morning by Richard Dequesne, a 
spokesman for the French Foreign Affairs Ministry. The French 
Government believes that the crisis has ended in Togo, and has 
decided to resume civil and military cooperation with our 
country. This cooperation had been suspended at the end of 
1992. The French Government noted that, up to now, the long 
political crisis experienced in Togo did not permit them to 
engage in palliative measures to cushion the impact of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc, as was done for all other franc 
zone countries. These measures were essential to the country's 
economic and financial balance. 
  The French Government also announced that, to show its 
solidarity with the Togolese people, it has decided to resume 
its cooperation, and called on its European Union partners to 
follow suit. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] In Lusaka, the frame of the negotiations has not 
altered. This morning, UN Special Representative Alioune 
Blondin Beye, who is mediating the Angolan peace talks, held a 
meeting with government representatives and probably yet another 
one with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA]. However, nothing concrete is known about the issues 
discussed, since there is an absolute silence around the sides 
involved in the negotiating process. Thus, the face-to-face 
meeting between the government and UNITA negotiators to discuss 
the implementation of the modalities of national reconciliation 
has once again been postponed. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA says that it intends by all means to govern 
Huambo Province. This position was reaffirmed in the Zambian 
capital during a meeting between the UNITA team and members of 
extraparliamentary opposition parties held yesterday. The 
latter said that UNITA would not mind continuing holding talks 
until the year 2,000. Meanwhile, the government and UNITA teams 
will return to Mulungushi this afternoon. Radio Nacional de 
Angola has learned from a reliable source that Chief Blondin 
Beye will leave for the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, tomorrow, to 
hold talks with President Robert Mugabe on the Angolan peace 
talk underway in the Zambian capital.

  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi has written to UN envoy Alioune 
Beye to say that sanctions against UNITA will not mean the end 
of the world. Jonas Savimbi warned the Angolan peace talks 
mediator about the possibility of the United Nations imposing 
sanctions against UNITA. 
  According to the letter delivered to Alioune Beye today, 
dated yesterday [28 June] from Huambo, Savimbi said that UNITA 
would no longer live with the fear of sanctions. UNITA 
spokesman Jorge Valentim refused to go into detail, but did not 
repudiate the possible interpretation that his letter implied 
that the UNITA leadership admitted that the talks might break 
down if renewed sanctions were imposed against the movement. 
  The letter comes at the same time as an impasse at the 
Lusaka 
talks.

  [Text] Dr. Marcos Samondo yesterday urged the UN Security 
Council not to impose sanctions against the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in view of the progress 
made in the ongoing negotiations. 
  [Begin Samondo recording] I hope the good sense will prevail 
so that the UN Security Council does not make the mistake of 
imposing sanctions on UNITA, because this will just complicate 
the process, and will not bring peace to Angola. [end recording] 
  Dr. Marcos Samondo, UNITA's representative in New York, 
later 
on said that UNITA wants to govern Huambo because it is a matter 
of survival, since Huambo is a place of security for UNITA, and 
this should be understood within the framework of reconciliation. 
  [Begin Samondo recording] At present there is an obstacle on 
the issue of governing Huambo. It is vital that the Security 
Council understand that Huambo is important for UNITA, because 
Huambo at present represents a third in security and protection 
against government intents. As you know populations were 
massacred in Luanda [words indistinct]. The observers and the 
mediator have not yet understood the importance of Huambo in the 
national reconciliation process. I just hope that the Security 
Council will not state that UNITA should give up its stand on 
the Huambo issue, because for us Huambo is vital at this stage 
of negotiations, as well as in this process of reconciliation, 
and in the agreements which may eventually be signed. [end

  On the involvement of South African President Nelson Mandela 
in the Angolan peace process, encouraged by UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye who has been to South Africa 
recently, and hailed by UNITA, the UNITA representative in the 
United Nations said this intervention may be void if the UN 
Security Council imposes further sanctions. 
  [Begin Samondo recording] Chief Beye has recently been to 
South Africa where he met with South African President Mandela 
having requested him to play a role in the Angolan process. 
However, 90 percent of the document on the Lusaka accord is 
already complete, and only 10 percent remains to be tackled. On 
the 10 percent, the fundamental issue regards Huambo, and I 
believe President Mandela may play a positive role, but if the 
United Nations imposes sanctions on UNITA I do not believe Mr. 
Mandela will have any chance or opportunity of being involved in 
the mediation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Standing Committee of the </F>
Political Commission of UNITA in Huambo on 28 June] 
  [Text] 1. On 18 June 1994, Jonas Savimbi, president of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], 
received Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN 
secretary general in Angola, as well as the representatives of 
the United States, Russia, and Portugal. President Savimbi 
congratulated the mediators for their efforts, noting that 90 
percent of the work at the peace talks had already been carried 
out. Thus, he encouraged them to quickly examine the remaining 
problems. This is UNITA's stand. 
  2. We were thus astonished to learn that the UN secretary 
general still wants to apply additional sanctions against our 
party. Under these conditions, the UN Security Council will only 
be jeopardizing the work carried out in Lusaka for the past 
seven months. 
  3. The Political Commission will count on the UN Security 
Council's pragmatic attitude so as not to destroy so much work 
carried out in favor of peace in Angola. With additional 
sanctions, UNITA will draw the right conclusions. Apart from 
peace and democracy, UNITA also defends the cultural values of 
the citizens in Angola and on the continent. UNITA cannot 
eternally live in fear of sanctions from the UN Security 
Council. This attitude goes against [words indistinct] 
governing the United Nations. 
  4. UNITA has accepted and decreed a unilateral cease-fire on 
20 September 1993. This cease-fire was fruitless, however, 
because the government of the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola [MPLA] did not respect it. 
  5. There are no hostages in Huambo. Those nongovernmental 
humanitarian organizations that did not want to stay in Huambo 
left for Luanda on 17 June 1994. Only the personnel of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] decided to 
remain in Huambo. If the ICRC also wants to leave Huambo, it 
can do so immediately, without any prior notice. The Luanda 
government is to blame for the suspension of humanitarian aid 
flights, since it uses food as a political weapon against the 
Angolan people. There are so much lying and pharisaical 
hypocrisy that UNITA no longer fears anything but just waits to 
see what will happen. 
  [Issued] Huambo, 28 June 1994. 
  [Signed] The Standing Committee of the Political Commission 
of UNITA.

important that the international community understand that in 
Angola there is only one violator. 
  [Begin Lourenco recording] It is not the government which

we heard that even the U.S. Administration thinks that the 
government has satisfied all the mediator's proposals and 
requests UNITA to follow the government's example. This only 
confirms that if there is no peace in the country at present, it 
is because UNITA is not ready for it. [end recording]

the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola against 
government-held positions, and the indiscriminate shelling of

Police, and the Civil Defense had no option but to flush out the 
men in the service of Jonas Savimbi [words indistinct]. 
Government forces have been in control of the city of Kuito 
since yesterday. Jonas Savimbi's organization abandoned more 
than 200 men killed and large quantities of weapons.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Angolan Government is claiming major military 
successes in its war against the UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola] rebels. For several weeks now, 
UNITA has been putting increasing pressure on towns, such as 
Malanje and Kuito. Aid flights have been badly interrupted and 
civilians have suffered badly in the sieges. But now the 
government claims there has been a turnaround and that the UNITA 
tide is being pushed back. It says all the UNITA forces in Kuito 
have been driven out of the city. Robin White asked our Luanda 
correspondent, Chris Simpson, if he could confirm that. 
  [Simpson] It seems to be born out by independent sources as 
well. The government have been gaining the upper hand. We 
understand they now control the road between Kuito and Kunje, 
four miles to the north. So, that is quite an important 
territorial victory, if that is proven to be correct. 
  [White] How much of Kuito is left standing? 
  [Simpson] It is difficult to know but I think it is very 
clear from those people who were based there previously that the 
last round of fighting has been particularly intense. When I 
was last in Kuito in February, it was a very battered city. 
Virtually every building was covered in bullet holes and one 
fears that the intensity of the recent fighting would have 
reduced it even more [words indistinct]. What people used to 
say when you talk to them there was how they thought it should 
be turned into a war museum. It wasn't a proper place to live at 
all, and I am sure they will feel that now as well. 
  [White] How important is Kuito? 
  [Simpson] Well, it is very much seen by UNITA as part of its 
heartland. What they always tell you is that Jonas Savimbi went 
to school there. They won an overwhelming victory in the 
elections there in 1992. It is very much part of their 
constituency, their heartland. What may alarm UNITA is that if 
the government recaptures or gains complete control of the 
airport that could have serious implications that the government 
could use the airport to strike out at UNITA positions around. 
I mean, UNITA still controls a vast wave of territory around 
Kuito, pretty much the whole of the Province of Bie. 
  [White] You think UNITA can get back [word indistinct]? 
  [Simpson] Well, in this war, there are very few clear-cut 
victories and the government may be sounding rather bullish at 
the moment talking about an important victory, but it is very 
much a [words indistinct] changes around quite rapidly. I am 
sure UNITA is capable of striking at government positions 
elsewhere in the country. They have certainly been putting a 
lot of pressure on N'Dalatando [words indistinct] and I 
certainly think it is certainly premature to talk about the 
government having firm control of Kuito for a foreseeable future 
even.

Correspondent Tony Joao reports. 
  A few days ago, UNITA destroyed the bridge over the Lombe 
River at Lau Comercial to halt the advance of the government 
forces. In a report issued in Malanje yesterday, the National 
Police Command reveals that the joint forces -- the FAA forces, 
the National Police, and the Civilian Defense -- have reoccupied 
the villages of Aviario and Sanzala do Lau. The report says 
that at present actions continue toward Lau [word indistinct], 
an area which was being used by Savimbi's troops to shell the 
local airport.

  [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader 
Afonso Dhlakama yesterday once again accused the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] government of infiltrating troops 
into the Police of the Republic of Mozambique. Dhlakama said 
that Frelimo is carrying out efforts to bolster the capacity of 
militiamen and the Rapid Intervention Police. Speaking to 
journalists on his arrival in Chimoio yesterday, President 
Joaquim Chissano said Frelimo is not bothered about the training 
of the new nonpartisan Mozambican army. He said this is 
evidenced by the failure to create the necessary conditions in 
the training centers. 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] That is normal. That is normal. 
The Mozambican Government is not giving emphasis to this very 
important process. As you are aware, the barracks, the training 
camps have not been rehabilitated. The process is very much 
behind schedule. Instead of giving emphasis to the training of a 
nonpartisan national army, Frelimo is carrying out efforts to 
bolster the capacity of militiamen and the Rapid Intervention 
Police. It is infiltrating troops into the Mozambican police. 
This is a lamentable situation. All the same, I believe that we 
will be able to exercise our influence. [end recording] 
  The Renamo leader said the demobilization process is 
currently experiencing difficulties because the government is 
not interested in seeing things move smoothly in order to 
boycott the elections scheduled for October this year. 
[sentence as heard] 
  Meanwhile, today, the second day of his visit to Manica 
Province, President Afonso Dhlakama will carry out internal work 
with his party members, and this evening he will have a meeting 
with businessmen in the province. 
  According to his working program, he will leave tomorrow for 
Gondola District, and he will then visit the Manica Provincial 
Hospital and some companies in Chimoio. He will also hold a 
meeting with his party's technical cadres stationed here in 
Manica. 
  Yesterday the Renamo leader was honored with a friendly 
dinner on the occasion of his visit to Manica Province.

<F P=106> [Text of address by President Joaquim Chissano on 24 June to </F>
mark the country's 19th independence anniversary; place not 
given] 
  [Text] Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots: 
  At midnight on 25 June 1994, we shall celebrate another 
anniversary of our country's existence as an independent and 
sovereign country. 
  We shall celebrate the 19th national independence 
anniversary, thus remembering a period of great euphoria and 
hope experienced by all Mozambicans on 25 June 1975, when they 
began to open a new chapter in the country's multicentennial 
history. 
  25 June 1975 was a particularly solemn and important period 
during which we assumed the responsibility of leading our 
fatherland's destiny. 
  The proclamation of independence was the result of the 
national liberation struggle, waged by the Mozambique Liberation 
Front [Frelimo], which is also celebrating 32 years of existence 
today. 
  In order to obtain success in the struggle for national 
liberation, it was necessary to unite the entire Mozambican 
people around a common objective -- to gain national 
independence. 
  It was our unity that made us Mozambicans, with our own 
identity as a people and as a state in the context of the 
international community. 
  By strengthening unity we consolidate our Mozambican 
identity, our national independence, and we consolidate peace, 
which is an indispensable condition for our country's progress 
and our fatherland's prosperity. 
  I would therefore like to call on all Mozambican people, 
regardless of color, sex, race, tribe, party, or religion, to 
preserve and defend our unity against all attempts aimed at 
dividing our people. 
  Mozambican women, Mozambican men: 
  This is the second time that we celebrate our national 
independence anniversary in peace, following the signing of the 
General Peace Accord in 4 October 1992. Since then all 
Mozambicans have been living in peace and stability, devoting 
all their capabilities and energy toward consolidating 
democracy, national reconstruction, and the well-being of all 
Mozambicans. 
  Since the establishment of peace, my government has been 
successfully implementing a number of programs within the 
framework of national reconstruction and the normalization of 
our people's life. 
  The undertakings carried out by my government include the 
reconstruction of schools, hospitals, the opening and repair of 
bore holes, wells, renovation, maintenance, and opening of 
roads, bridges, and runways throughout the country. 
  With the establishment of peace, with the return of refugees 
and war-displaced people, and following their engagement in 
productive activity during 1993, we achieved an economic growth 
rate of 19 percent, against a target of about six percent. 
  On behalf of my government and on my own behalf, I would 
like 
to salute the Mozambican people, who responded and continue to 
respond positively to efforts carried out by my government and 
civilian society to pacify the country and obtain greater 
democratic openness and the political participation for all 
citizens. 
  I would like to convey a message of appreciation to the 
national business community which, believing in the present 
political, economic, and social moment brought about by peace, 
contributed greatly to the growth of the national economy. 
  I would also like to salute the international community for 
the political and financial assistance it rendered. It is my 
hope that this assistance will continue to be rendered for our 
country's economic growth and well-being, which the Mozambican 
people deserve and so much desire. 
  We are now facing new challenges. We have the responsibility 
of continuing to develop efforts aimed at increasing production 
in conformity with this year's economic and social plan. 
  Another natural disaster, cyclone "Nadia", hit our country, 
particularly the northern provinces, leaving thousands of people 
homeless, destitute, and without food, in addition to the 
economic damage it caused. 
  My government conveyed a message of sympathy to the affected 
people and took the necessary measures to assist them. Actions 
are under way to minimize the effects of the cyclone as well as 
to guarantee the implementation of the production targets 
established for this year. 
  I would like to urge the people, economic agents, and the 
international community to continue to give their contribution 
in order to realize these objectives. 
  Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots: 
  The voter registration process is an important moment to 
prepare for and organize the general multiparty election 
scheduled for 27 and 28 October this year. 
  The voter registration process is aimed at registering and 
identifying all voting-age Mozambicans to vote for the president 
of the Republic and for deputies in the National Assembly. 
Those who do not register cannot vote. 
  The voter registration process is a major task which 
requires 
the participation of all Mozambicans. By participating in the 
election, the citizens are exercising a constitutional right, a 
right that is also a compulsory civic duty for all Mozambicans 
of voting age. 
  It is the duty of all citizens to take part in the election 
and cooperate with the relevant authorities in all actions aimed 
at facilitating the process. 
  I would, therefore, like to call on registered political 
parties, which have great responsibility in the whole process, 
to do all they can for the success of the process and to ensure 
that the first general multiparty elections are free and fair. 
It is only in this way that the elected and the unelected can 
contribute to the success of national reconstruction, 
consolidation of peace, and the normalization of life for all 
our people. 
  Mozambican women, Mozambican men, compatriots: 
  It was with joy that the Mozambican people celebrated the 
electoral victory of the African National Congress and its 
President Nelson Mandela. Immediately after the announcement of 
the electoral results, on behalf of the Mozambican people, the 
government, and on my own behalf, I congratulated the people of 
this great country for ending "apartheid" and the coming to 
power of a majority government democratically elected, led by 
the ANC. 
  It was with great joy that the Republic of Mozambique, the 
Frontline States, the southern African and OAU countries 
welcomed the new South Africa as a member of the Frontline 
States, the OAU, and the United Nations. 
  The Republic of Mozambique has already begun a useful 
cooperation in different fields, particularly in the fields of 
manpower and ports and railroads, with the Republic of South, 
and it is our hope that this cooperation will continue to 
increase on the basis of greater trust and mutual benefits. 
  Thus, we are anxiously waiting for South Africa to become a 
member of the Southern African Development Community. 
  The electoral victory of the ANC and President Nelson 
Mandela 
is the result of the struggle carried out by the countries of 
the region and the international community to completely 
eradicate "apartheid". For us, the end of destabilizatio is the 
beginning of an era of peace and security in the region, the 
establishment of cooperative health relations for regional 
development. 
  It is our sincere hope that the fraternal people of South 
Africa will have a prosperous future, and we would like to 
convey our warm greetings to President Nelson Mandela for his 
election to the leadership of the new and free Republic of South 
Africa. 
  We would like to salute President Bakili Muluzi and the 
United Democratic Front of the Republic of Malawi for their 
victory in the recent free and democratic elections held in that 
fraternal country. 
  We would also like to salute the Malawian people for their 
political maturity and desire to change toward real democracy in 
their country. We hope to begin a new era of bilateral 
cooperation, given the historic ties and the major economic and 
social interests linking the Republic of Mozambique and the 
Republic of Malawi. 
  Compatriots: 
  While on one hand, we salute positive developments in the 
Republics of South Africa and Malawi. On the other hand there 
is a cause for consternation in other republics. We refer to 
the day-to- day life in the fraternal countries of Angola, 
Rwanda, Somalia, Burundi, and Liberia. 
  Despite the great expectation surrounding peace negotiations 
in Lusaka between the Angolan Government and UNITA, we continue 
to be alarmed by the killing of innocent civilians in Angola. 
  My country appreciates the flexibility and the spirit of 
compromise demonstrated by the Angolan Government at the 
negotiating table. We would like to urge UNITA and its leader, 
Dr. Jonas Savimbi, to adopt a positive posture with a view to 
ending the suffering of the Angolan people. 
  We would like to call for a speedy conclusion of the 
negotiations with the subsequent signing of the Lusaka accord 
and the end of war in Angola. Our region desires a complete, 
true, and lasting peace. 
  What is happening in Rwanda is a true carnage that the world 
should neither ignore nor tolerate. We would like to appeal to 
the parties in the conflict to follow the path of dialogue. We 
would also like to appeal to the international community to give 
its material and financial assistance and find appropriate 
mechanisms to end this disaster at the end of the century. 
  Tensions prevail in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East where 
armed conflicts are rife. We are concerned with the situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the UN efforts to maintain peace 
and render humanitarian assistance to thousands of victims are 
rendered fruitless. 
  The problem generated around the Korean Peninsula endangers 
peace and security in that region, while in Yemen there is a 
generalized armed conflict which has been killing innocent 
people and causing the destruction of economic and social 
infrastructures in that country. 
  We favor dialogue and our desire is to see the leaders and 
the people of Yemen find the best way of resolving their 
differences. 
  Compatriots: 
  On this occasion when we celebrate the 19th national 
independence anniversary, I would like to salute the Mozambique 
Armed Forces for their commitment to and engagement in the 
defense of our country's sovereignty during all these 19 years. 
We want to reiterate that even with the establishment of the 
new national army -- the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] 
-- the government will continue to make efforts to find 
solutions which will guarantee them a honorable form of life and 
participation in the country's reconstruction. We want them to 
view their active participation in national reconstruction and 
the country's economic and social development as a right and the 
duty of each and everyone of them. 
  With unity and discipline, without hastiness, we shall be 
able to transform our desire into reality. 
  I would like to address a message of solidarity and respect 
to war-displaced people and refugees who have finally returned 
or continue to return home. It is my hope that their lives will 
normalize rapidly, as we guarantee them assistance in this 
direction. 
  To all workers, peasants, intellectuals, public servants, 
and 
others in different areas of production, I would like to convey 
my wishes for greater success in their tasks to contribute to 
the country's development and the well-being of the Mozambican 
people. 
  To all national and international nongovernmental 
organizations, foreign aid workers, religious denominations, and 
the entire civilian society, I would like to convey my 
appreciation for the effort they are exerting in the search for 
solutions to the various problems affecting the country and all 
our people. I would like to urge you to continue with your 
positive work in support of the economy and the needy. 
  I would like you all to celebrate 25 June in the happiest 
manner possible, hoping that the future will bring you 
prosperity and success in your activities. 
  It is also my desire that peace, unity, reconciliation, and 
national reconstruction will be the principal concern of all 
Mozambicans at this time when we celebrate the 19th national 
independence anniversary and when the holding of legislative and 
presidential elections, on 27 and 28 October 1994, is 
approaching. 
  Long live 25 June! 
  Long live national independence! 
  Long live the Mozambican people! 
  For peace, unity, justice, and progress; 
  For democracy, reconciliation, and national reconstruction; 
  For a better future; 
  The struggle continues!

  [Text] Finance Minister Eneias Comiche has told the 
MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY, AIM, that the Mozambican 
Government has not allocated 20 million hectares of land to the 
Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corporation based in the 
Netherlands. However, Comiche confirmed that last year the 
Mozambican Government and that organization signed an agreement. 
The finance minister said that contrary to reports made by a 
number of Mozambican and foreign journalists over the past few 
days that 20 million hectares of land were allocated to the 
organization, this agreement does not allocate or grant to the 
organization a specific portion of land in Mozambique. Eneias 
Comiche added that if the corporation chooses to carry out 
ventures in Mozambique, it will have to follow all the 
procedures stipulated by the current laws in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rachel Rawlings in Harare] </F>
  [Text] The Zimbabwe Government has decided to cash in on 
the increasingly peaceful atmosphere in the southern African 
subregion. At one time, the Zimbabwe army was heavily committed 
in Mozambique and also facing the threat of South African 
destabilization, but now it seems there is going to be a peace 
dividend. From Harare, Rachel Rawlings reports: 
  President Mugabe announced his government's intention to cut 
15,000 posts in the army, thus reducing its size by about 
one-third [figures as heard]. Opening a new parliamentary 
session today, President Mugabe said the general tranquility 
within Zimbabwe as well as the South African elections and 
Mozambican peace accord meant the time was right for the cut, 
but he reassured any fears of sudden mass unemployment, saying 
the government wouldn't simply put on the streets the affected 
young men and women who have so loyally, selflessly, and 
gallantly defended the country's sovereignty. He said 
demobilization would be carried out in two phases and the former 
soldiers would receive training in civilian skills. 
  The future of the army had been posing a serious problem. 
Zimbabwe's structural adjustment program calls for a substantial 
reduction in government's spending. The defense budget is 
massive, eating up nearly 10 percent of government expenditure, 
but it was increased last year despite the scaling down of 
military activities. This caused widespread dissatisfaction, 
because basic social services, such as health and education, 
became increasingly expensive for ordinary people. 
  On the other hand, as unemployment spirals ever upwards, it 
could have been dangerous to have thousands of unemployed 
military personnel joining the millions already searching 
fruitlessly for work. The peace dividend might be a nice idea, 
but it won't be clear until next month's budget exactly how much 
money will be saved and whether any of it will be reassigned to 
other parts of government or whether most of it will be used up 
in the proposed retraining program.

  [Text] Opposition parties yesterday dissociated themselves 
from the idea of forming a united army, advocated by Zimbabwe 
United Movement co-president Mr Edgar Tekere, to fight the 
ruling ZANU (PF) [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic 
Front] during the current campaign for next year's general 
elections. 
  Opposition leaders who were attending the Zim-rights 
consultative conference in Harare, however, emphasised that they 
were urging members of their parties to defend themselves should 
they be attacked by anybody for holding legitimate rallies. 
  Mr Tekere was quoted at the weekend as having said "Let us 
build an opposition army of "Angels with Swords" to put down the 
Mugabe-ZANU (PF) evil. 
  "Let us mobilise and recruit from among all able-bodied 
Zimbabweans, irrespective of party-political affiliation, for 
our "Angels with Swords" to put down, for all time, any 
temptation to resort to party-political violence." 
  Yesterday the president of ZANU (Ndonga), Rev Ndabaningi 
Sithole, said that if it is to be an "Army of Angels", to him 
that amounted to a call that the people involved should be ready 
for any eventuality. 
  "The angels are always there," he said. "They swing into 
action when there is need. In this sense I am thinking of 
spiritual angels. 
  "Ndonga says if we are attacked we will attack. If they kill 
us we will kill them. If they disappear us (sic) we will 
disappear them." 
  The vice-president of Forum Party of Zimbabwe, Mr Washington 
Sansole, said what the party chief, Dr Enoch Dumbutshena, meant 
by urging members to arm themselves with spears and axes had 
been taken out of context. 
  "It (the statement) is attracting confusion to what the 
original purpose of Dumbutshena was," he said. "The emphasis 
was on defensive action...Only if you are attacked within your 
home. 
  "Past experience," he said, "is the invitation for 
house-to-house campaign is a euphemism to violence. 
  "ZANU (PF) has never been successful in holding peaceful 
elections. If our supporters encounter a situation which 
requires them to take defensive action they should not be afraid 
to do so." 
  Mr Sansole spurned the idea of "Angels with Swords". 
  Rev Sithole said there should be an interim government in 
the 
run-up to, and during the, elections. 
  "The problem is changing the attitudes of the people," he 
said. "The problem is the powers-that-be. That is why we, in 
ZANU (Ndonga), believe that up to the time of the elections 
tremendous popular pressure has to be brought on the Government 
to allow the introduction of an interim government. 
  "People are losing confidence in the Government," he said. 
"Once they (people) adopt an interim government, the confidence 
will be restored." 
  Rev Sithole said an interim government would be a barometer 
indicating whether (ZANU) (PF) was sincere in saying next year's 
general elections would be free and fair. 
  Rejecting this idea, Rev Sithole said, was an indication 
that 
the Government was not sincere in its intentions. 
  He said that, with the interim government in place, the 
present government would go on as it is, but some people from 
"reputed" opposition parties would be brought into the executive. 
  "Each of these (opposition) parties would give one or two 
people to be in interim government, which will guarantee free 
and fair elections."

  [Text] Fresh clashes occurred between opposition supporters 
and security forces in the Congolese capital Brazzaville. At 
least two people were killed in Pila in the eastern part of 
Brazzaville. Tension seems to have ebbed but sporadic shots from 
automatic weapons were still heard last night at Pila considered 
as the stronghold of the supporters of former President Sassou 
Nguesso. This new tension followed the kidnapping last Saturday 
of two sympathizers of the Presidential Group in Bacongo in the 
sourthen part of Brazzaville and stronghold of the members of 
the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development 
led by Bernard Kolelas.

  [Text] A new party, the Democratic and Social Union [UDS], 
has been formed in Gabon. Led by parliament member Herve 
Oussamane the UDS tows a centrist line, and is the outcome of a 
rift that has been brewing for the past several months within 
the Gabonese Socialist Union [USG], one of the political 
organizations leaning toward the president's party. Herve 
Oussamane speaks here to Jean Valere Mbinamanza: 
  [Begin Oussamane recording] In April last year, we formed 
the USG-CGI [expansion unknown]. The idea was to keep in tune 
with a political and legal procedure, because the CGI 
represented a political persuasion which we upheld at that time 
within the USG. The USG and the CGI share the same philosophy: 
the struggle for free expression and against social 
inequalities. The problem, however, is in terms of approach. 
We thought that one cannot claim to be democratizing the 
country without first democratizing the party, and we noted 
that, indeed, the socialist ideals for which we stood during the 
national conference had been relegated to the background. [end

  [Excerpts] After inspecting his troops in Goma in Zaire and 
visiting a Tutsi refugee camp in Nyarushishi in southwest 
Rwanda, this afternoon Francois Leotard went to (Gishyita), a 
town on the central shore of Lake Kivu, still in Rwanda. The 
French defense minister was visiting a group of French special 
forces stationed less than 4 km -- as the crow flies -- from the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] positions. Francois Leotard 
explained that Rwanda must remain a multiethnic country, and 
preached French neutrality. Christophe Boisbouvier: 
  [Boisbouvier] [passage omitted] There won't be any 
evacuations, said Francois Leotard, since there is no place 
where these refugees can be housed, but there will be more and 
more frequent French missions on the ground. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Francois Leotard stressed the need to pass the 
baton on to the United Nations soon, and indeed the arrival of 
French troops in Rwanda has somewhat destablized the work of the 
UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR], the UN mission on the 
ground. The two military forces now have to coordinate their 
missions: That is what UNAMIR Commander General Dallaire wants, 
as he said just now in Nairobi, where he presented the UN medal 
to 100 or so soldiers who had served in Rwanda: 
  [Begin recording] [Dallaire] We are working hard to increase 
its capacity and to be in a position to deploy more resources to 
be able to help the humanitarian side and to be there to monitor 
the cease-fires which I hope we will have some day. 
  [Correspondent Jean Helene] Is it possible to envisage the 
French, and the coalition, the French Government, deploying in 
government zones, and UNAMIR reinforcements deploying in rebel 
zones? 
  [Dallaire] No. The scenario appears to reflect that, but my 
positions and headquarters could move, and what we are doing is 
to retire via our logistics base, which is Entebbe, and we are 
going to spread out throughout the RPF zone and in the 
government zone. We still have men in Kigali, on the government 
side, and (?will continue to have them). 
  [Helene] Do you expect to replace the French coalition in 
the 
west of the country when you have received your reinforcements? 
  [Dallaire] Well, we -- the commander of the force and I -- 
are going to hold discussions, to see exactly what its 
operational plans and its operational aims are, and the 
procedures will then be determined. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] French troops have been in our country for the 
last [word indistinct] days. The French defense minister 
reportedly has arrived in Cyangugu, southwestern Rwanda, to 
inspect his troops, and is accompanied by the French official in 
charge of humanitarian affairs. [passage omitted] 
  On 27 June the French carried out so-called patrols, up to 
20 
km from the battlefront, in Gikongoro [words indistinct]. It is 
worth recalling the RPF's conditions for avoiding fighting 
between the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] and the French Army 
[words indistinct]. First, the French Forces must not overstep 
their humanitarian mission. Second, French troops should not 
cross the borderline of the western region. Third, the French 
presence in Rwanda must end in July, as announced by the French 
Government itself. 
  Some of these three points, which should govern Operation 
Turquoise, have already been overstepped. As we have just told 
you, French (?troops) have started to approach the combat zone. 
Their mission has also started to show its nonhumanitarian 
character. How can one assess the fact that French soldiers 
abandoned 100 Tutsis they found being pursued in Kibuye Forest 
by the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy 
and Development militia], who had just killed one of the Tutsis? 
Is that not a reconnaissance mission being carried out by the 
French soldiers on behalf of the militias responsible for the 
genocide of the Kibuye region? [passage omitted] 
  Briefly, the French military operation in Rwanda is just 
meant to explore mass graves [words indistinct]. If the French 
mission is really humanitarian, why can't they disarm the 
killers found at crime spots. [passage indistinct] A wise man 
said you can fool some people some of the time, but not all the 
people all of the time.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with RPF leader Alexis Kanyarengwe by </F>
Frederic Fritscher in Mulindi on 26 June: "Rwandan Patriotic 
Front Relaxes Its Position Toward Paris"] 
  [Excerpt] Kigali -- "We have never appreciated, much less 
supported, the French intervention," RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] leader Alexis Kanyarengwe said to us at his sanctuary in 
Mulindi, located some 10 kilometers from the Ugandan border. 
"When Paris made its decision, we considered it a gesture of 
aggression. However, the international community, in the voice 
of the UN Security Council, covered France. If France sticks to 
its humanitarian mandate, then it will be a very good thing. We 
are not in principle opposed to a humanitarian operation, we 
simply would have preferred it to be carried out by soldiers 
from another country." 
  The threat of confrontation between the RPF resistance 
fighters and French troops is no longer valid, according to Mr. 
Kanyarengwe. This contradicts what his representative in Europe, 
Jacques Bihozagara, let it be understood on Thursday [23 June], 
the day after his meeting with Alain Juppe. The RPF president 
said he was reassured by the statements made by French diplomats 
who came to Mulindi last last week to clarify Paris' intentions 
to him. "I simply made it clear to them that the entire 
territory of Rwanda is a zone of operations," he stressed. 
  The RPF's less virulent tone does not erase its old 
grievances -- far from it. "France supported the old regime by 
the military presence of its troops, financing and training 
Rwandan military personnel and militias, and by diplomatic 
actions abroad," Mr. Kanyarengwe recalled. He sees no "direct 
involvement" by Paris in the attack which cost the life of 
President Juvenal Habyarimana on 6 April. 
  Mr. Kanyarengwe is satisfied militarily. "The RPF now 
occupies more than half of Rwandan territory. We hold the 
prefectures of Byumbo, Kigali, and part of the Ruhengeri, 
Gitarama, Gigumbo, and some areas in the prefecture of Butare," 
he said. "Kigali is under pressure and should fall soon. It is 
just a matter of days now." 
  The RPF leader affirmed that he wanted to reach a cease-fire 
agreement "with the government military forces" once the 
massacres have ended. He demands that those responsible for the 
genocide be brought to justice before discussing any alterations 
to the Arusha accord. This accord, signed in August 1993 by the 
Rwandan political parties, "will have to serve as the foundation 
for setting up future transitional institutions," Mr. 
Kanyarengwe said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Captain Barril is making too much of the matter and 
his verbosity risks harming the credibility of what he says and 
the credibility of those sponsoring him. Initially, the former 
"super gendarme" from the GIGN [National Gendarmerie 
Intervention Group] had assured the daily LE MONDE that he had 
the black box of the Falcon 50 in which the Rwandan and 
Burundian presidents were killed, and that he had gone to Kigali 
to look for it on behalf of [deceased] Rwandan President 
Habyarimana family.

[28 June] at noon, the former officer went much further: He 
claimed that he had recordings of the conversations with the 
control tower, in which, he says, he recognized "Belgian" 
accents. These recordings were made by the Rwandan Armed 
Forces. He also confirmed that he had satellite photos 
indicating an offensive on the Ugandan border begun on 6 April. 
  Someone who tries too hard to show something ends up not 
convincing anyone, or even raising questions about the exact 
nature of his mission. In this connection, LE CANARD ENCHAINE 
wrote that the former member of the presidential palace's 
gendarme "cell," who has not totally broken with his former 
employers, actually went to Kigali to recover President 
Habyarimana's files. It was therefore dangerous, to say the 
least, to hurriedly send someone as controversial as him to 
center stage. 
  Indeed, Barril's statements are peppered with contradictions 
and inaccuracies. First of all, it is amazing that a private 
individual should still have access to satellite photos, the use 
of which is supposed to be reserved for military personnel. As 
for the place from where the missiles were fired on 6 April, 
that was an area controlled by the Presidential Guard. The RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] did not arrive until May. As for the 
black box itself, the mystery has not been cleared up at all: 
Dassault maintenance personnel say that this type of airplane 
did not have a black box and a pilot thinks that the object 
submitted by Barril was just a radio-compass box. The fact 
remains, however, that shortly after the crash, an object 
resembling the black box was picked up in the wreckage of the 
airplane by a French military volunteer. Who handed it over to 
Paul Barril? The Rwandan Government, to whom the object was 
supposedly given afterward? One might also wonder whether the 
remains of the black box shown on French television were not 
something put together to make people forget the existence of a 
compromising "original." 
  In addition, Barril supposedly discovered parts of the SAM-7 
missile launchers in Massaka. So the elite shooters, 
undoubtedly professionals, were absentminded, were they? In any 
case, in May, when the RPF held the area, the land had clearly 
been gone over with a fine-tooth comb, so it would have been 
with the help of the previous occupants, the Presidential Guard, 
that Barril made his discoveries. 
  There is another inaccuracy in Barril's statements: He 
maintains that no international inquiry has been requested. In 
actual fact, in the first few hours after the attack, and once 
again when the Belgian Blue Helmets were accused of having 
assassinated the president, something which led to the death of 
10 of them, the Belgian Government asked the International Civil 
Aviation Organization to open an inquiry. This request is 
regularly called up by Brussels. 
  Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether the Mystere 
Falcon, piloted by a crew comprising former military personnel, 
should be considered a civilian aircraft. 
  Apart from the contradictions in the testimony, it is now 
important to wonder why the family of the dead president, and 
other sponsors, asked Barril to put his talents as a storyteller 
and editor at the service of a version which is slowly losing 
its plausibility, namely a version which claims that there was 
Belgian involvement, in collaboration with the RPF. 
Increasingly, a theory is gaining ground which says that the 
"tough guys" of the regime, members of president's wife's 
family, instigated the attack and provided the inspiration for 
the massacres. 
  Even the fact that Elie Sagatwa, considered the leader of 
the 
regime's "hawks," was also in the airplane along with the chief 
of staff, does not prove anything: President Habyarimana knew 
he was under threat, a coup had already been prepared for 23 
March and a number of high-ranking officers had already let it 
be known that important events were being prepared. President 
Habyarimana could have been trying to protect himself by 
surrounding himself with heavyweight personalities and having 
himself accompanied by the Burundian president. 
  It is also impossible not to notice that Captain Barril's 
explosion onto the media scene followed the publication in LE 
SOIR of a theory which is still being looked into by the Belgian 
military prosecutor's office and which involves two French 
nationals. 
<H5>  Screens </H5>
  In reality, Paul Barril's intervention could have something 
in common with "Operation Turquoise," namely that both are 
"screen" operations with hidden motives. "Operation Turquoise" 
despite preventing further massacres, could be considered as a 
humanitarian enterprise concealing other objectives. Among 
other things, it would be a matter of bringing out people who 
have stuck with the government or pulling local collaborators 
out of the Rwandan hell. These people do not face the greatest 
danger but they know a great deal. Radio messages have been 
broadcast, calling on those who can to reach Kibuye. The 
members of the Mille Collines Radio are also said to be 
preparing to be evacuated by the French. 
  In the Zairian city of Goma, observers have noted the 
presence of soldiers who do not belong to any officially engaged 
unit. And the push of the French Army to Gikongoro, a few km 
from the front line, worries those who fear a clash between the 
RPF and "Operation Turquoise." 
  This clash could easily take place elsewhere: A witness at 
Bangui airport in the Central African Republic saw French 
soldiers equipped with parachutes. They seemed convinced that 
they would be required to jump on Kigali in the coming hours and 
therefore directly face the RPF. 
  Moreover "Operation Turquoise," which is clearly being 
required to act circumspectly by the Balladur government, is 
producing secondary effects: The media deployment it has caused 
is revealing the extent of the genocide and inevitably leading 
to questions about everyone's responsibilities. The "screen" 
operations are also seeking to turn these questions toward other 
targets. 
  Now that at last, and too late, all the attention is going 
to 
Rwanda, its neighbor Burundi is living through very critical 
times. Provisional President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya said that 
his country was on the brink and that distrust between citizens 
had reached new heights. 
  It appears that large Israeli arms deliveries are at present 
reaching Burundi via Goma. They are probably intended for the 
extremist Palipehutu movement and the Burundi Democratic Front 
hard-liners. At this moment on the hills of Burundi, people are 
being taught how to use M-16's and Uzi machine guns.

  [Text] The federal office of the Union of Independent 
Democrats [UDI] at Matonge in the Kalamu Area was the target of 
a terrorist attack in the night of 24 June. A locally made bomb 
set in the building exploded. There was no loss of human lives 
but property damage has been reported. This was disclosed by 
Mr. (Tambo Mwamba), UDI national chairman. He was speaking this 
morning at a news briefing he held before reporters of 
state-owned and private media organs. The speaker said this is 
the fourth time his party has been the victim of acts of 
violence. He observed that his party has sufficient material 
means to react, but in a democracy people must express views and 
discuss or advance convincing arguments. It is not advisable to 
resort to violence in the event of disagreement on a viewpoint, 
UDI Chairman (Tambo Mwamba) concluded, adding that he is looking 
forward to the findings of the inquiry on the bomb attack [words 
indistinct].

  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that China welcomes foreign bankers to invest in 
China's power industry and construction on other infrastructures. 
  Li made the remarks during a meeting with bankers from the 
World Bank and representatives from 17 banks of six countries 
that are providing loans by means of Expanded Co-Financing (ECO) 
to China's Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant here this afternoon. 
  During the meeting, Li extended his welcome and 
congratulations to the bankers for the success of the 120 
million U.S. dollar ECO cooperation program for the Chinese 
plant, saying that China's economy has had sustained 
development, in which the development of the power industry 
holds an important position. 
  Long into the future, he said, China will continue to take 
in 
foreign funds and equipment to accelerate its development in the 
power industry and on other infrastructural construction. 
  Li said that for the past several decades, China's power 
industry has witnessed great progress, but it is still 
inadequate for the development of the whole national economy and 
the raising of people's living standards. 
  Therefore, Li said, the Chinese Government has adopted 
various measures to speed up power development so that it will 
be developed with an annual increase rate of eight to nine 
percent in the following five years. 
  Considering this point, said the Chinese premier, the power 
industry market in China is promising. 
  Li said that in the past 14 years, China and the World Bank 
have conducted effective cooperation. China has not only 
received loans from the World Bank but also learned experience 
in management, he added. 
  China hopes to strengthen its cooperation with the World 
Bank 
and other foreign financial institutions in the power industry 
and other infrastructure constructions, said Li. 
  The World Bank has decided to provide a 350 million U.S. 
dollar loan for the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant and agreed to 
provide a guarantee for those foreign banks which provide the 
120 million U.S. dollars in loans for the ECO program. 
  Li praised the World Bank and other relevant financial 
institutions for their efforts in promoting the ECO program with 
the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant. 
  He said that ECO is a good mode of cooperation, adding that 
the success of the program shows that the cooperation between 
China and the World Bank and other foreign financial 
institutions has a bright future. 
  The Chinese premier said that with development of China's 
economy, the enhancement of its economic strength and the 
success of its foreign currency system reform, China's ability 
to pay back loans in foreign currency is no problem. 
  The representatives of banks that are providing the ECO loan 
said that they are satisfied with the implementation of the 
program, which has been accomplished within such a short period 
of time. 
  The World Bank and other foreign banks will use the ECO 
program with the Yangzhou Thermo-Power Plant as reference for 
the next ECO program with China, so as to expand the scale of 
cooperation with China, they said. 
  Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and Minister Shi Dazhen 
of the power industry took part in the meeting.

  [Text] United Nations, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The United 
Nations Security Council tonight called for "immediate 
consultations" between the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on 
necessary measures for discharging nuclear fuel rods. 
  In a statement by the president of the Security Council, the 
Council "strongly urges" the DPRK only to proceed with the 
discharge operations at its 5-megawatt reactor in a manner which 
preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements as 
required by the IAEA. 
  In a letter dated May 27 to the U.N. secretary-general, the 
IAEA said if the discharge operation at the 5-megawatt reactor 
continues at the same rate, the IAEA's opportunity to select, 
segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements in 
accordance with IAEA standards will be lost within days. 
  The Security Council said it is "gravely concerned" by the 
IAEA's assessment. 
  The Security Council also asked the IAEA director-general to 
maintain IAEA inspectors in the DPRK to monitor activities at 
the 5-megawatt reactor. 
  During the Security Council consultation before the adoption 
of the president's statement, China's Permanent Representative 
to the U.N. Li Zhaoxing urged the IAEA and DPRK to make further 
consultations on the technical measures for monitoring the 
discharge of nuclear fuel rods and reach agreement as early as 
possible so as to ensure the continuation of nuclear safeguard 
monitoring. 
  Li reiterated China's view that the final way to solve this 
nuclear issue is by dialogues and negotiations between the 
related parties through channels that have been established, and 
all efforts by the international community should contribute to 
this goal.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Woman ambassadors and 
wives of diplomatic envoys of various countries gathered here 
today to discuss such topics as family, women and children, as a 
way to mark the "International Year of the Family". 
  Zhou Hanqiong, wife of Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen , said at the meeting that there are over 
200 million families in China. The Chinese Government has 
always attached great importance to the role of the family, as 
it is the basic cell of society. 
  She said that a happy and harmonious family constitutes an 
important part of Chinese culture. It has also many social 
functions to perform. 
  If every family enjoys harmony and progress, Zhou said, it 
will contribute significantly to social stability, cultural and 
ethical advancement, reform and development and higher 
population quality. 
  She said: "While enjoying the warmth, care and security of 
the family, we cannot forget that there are still places in the 
world where families are suffering from chaos of war, where 
numerous mothers and children have lost homes, having neither 
warmth nor security. We deeply sympathize with their plight. 
  "We hope to see an early end to these wars so that the 
mothers and their children will regain their family warmth and 
well-being in a peaceful environment," she said. 
  Farid Rahman, representative of the office of the United 
Nations Children's Fund in China, spoke on children's education. 
  He said that on the occasion of the International Year of 
the 
Family, it is of great importance to stress again the role that 
families play in children's subsistence and development. 
  Rahman noted the astonishing progress that China has made 
over the past 44 years in this regard, adding that there was 
still much to be done. The United Nations Children's Fund is 
willing to help China solve these problems in cooperating with 
it. 
  Prof Yan Renying, Chinese expert on women's health and 
children, and Mrs. Lombo, wife of the ambassador of Zaire, Lombo 
Lo Mangamanga, spoke respectively on "maternity and child care" 
and "family and children's education".

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Peng Peiyun, 
chairperson of the Chinese Organizing Committee of the Fourth 
World Conference on Women, said here today that as a host, the 
Chinese government attaches great importance to the convocation 
of the conference. 
  "Now it has been listed as an important item on the 
government's work agenda," said Peng, also Chinese State 
Councillor, at a meeting with Gertrude Mongella, 
secretary-general of the Fourth World Women's Conference, here 
this afternoon. 
  During the meeting the two agreed that they share a common 
goal of making the conference a success, with hopes for 
furthering their cooperation and making full preparations for 
the conference. 
  Peng said that now the Chinese organizing committee has been 
soundly formed and every functional committee has drawn up 
detailed plans, which are now being gradually implemented, 
  She said: "Our preparations in the fields of finance, 
materials and manpower have also been supported by governments 
at all levels and the Chinese people as well." 
  Many non-governmental organizations also have shown their 
aspirations to contribute to the World Women's Conference, she 
said, adding: "This will be an important guarantee for us to 
make preparations well." 
  Peng said that under the outstanding leadership of Mongella, 
the secretariat of the United Nations has made unremitting 
efforts and is playing an important role in promoting the 
preparatory work in regions of the world and various countries' 
departments at all levels. 
  "We appreciate this," she added. 
  She said: "We very much cherish our good cooperation and 
ties 
established between us. It is our inclination that the two 
sides will make concerted efforts for the successful convocation 
of the Fourth World Women's Conference." 
  Mongella said that her tour of China has enabled her to know 
more about the progress that China, the host, has made in its 
preparatory work. 
  Now that the Chinese organizing committee has become further 
established, she believes that with the care of the Chinese 
government, the preparatory work for the conference will be 
conducted smoothly. 
  With the growth of the Chinese economy, the social status of 
Chinese women has risen greatly. 
  "We appreciate the confidence and courage that Chinese women 
have shown in China's reform and the important roles that they 
are playing. This provides an important condition for the 
successful convocation of the conference," she said. 
  This morning, Mongella and the second study group from the 
UN 
led by Ebrima K. Jobarteh, deputy secretary-general of the 
Fourth World Women's Conference, made a special inspection of 
the Beijing International Convention Center and the Beijing Asia 
Hotel. 
  The officials of the Chinese organizing committee briefed 
them on the preparatory work made since Mongella's first tour of 
China. 
  Since then, the international convention center has been 
defined as a place for holding the conference, to be held in 
Beijing in 1995. 
  The host said that over the past year, the Chinese side has 
made positive preparations for the conference according to the 
requirements raised since the last study tour. 
  The halls for meetings and rooms for offices, press and 
services as well as various facilities that the conference needs 
have been decided on the whole. 
  Mongella congratulated China for its progress in making 
preparations for the conference, adding: "I have full confidence 
in the successful convocation of the conference."

  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Chen Muhua, 
vice-chairwoman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
Standing Committee, said here today that the Fourth World 
Conference on Women to be held here next year will be of great 
significance in raising women's social status. 
  The NPC vice-chairwoman made the remarks when she met with a 
delegation from the United Nations headed by Gertrude Mongella, 
secretary-general of the conference, here this afternoon. 
  Chen said that Mrs. Mongella, as secretary-general of the 
conference, shoulders great responsibility. Making the 
conference successful is the will of various sides and China is 
willing to strengthen contacts and consultations with the U.N. 
so as to prepare well for the conference, she added. 
  Extending her welcome to Mongella on her visit to China, 
Chen 
said that ever since the first U.N. delegation visited Beijing 
one year ago, the Chinese organizing committee for the 
conference has, according to the U.N.'s requirements and the 
needs of the conference, conducted scheduled preparations and 
achieved major progress. 
  Mongella said that before coming to Beijing this time, she 
traveled to some provinces and cities in China and saw with her 
own eyes the country's economic development. In particular, she 
added, she was impressed by the development in some economic 
development zones. 
  "We have felt the progress in the women's cause in China 
during the visit," said Mongella, "and we are greatly encouraged. 
  "Meanwhile, we are glad to see that the Chinese organizing 
committee has done a lot of preparations for the conference. 
  "The success of the conference will be the success of China, 
the host nation, as well as the success of the United Nations," 
Mongella said, "and let us work together to this end."

  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese official Liu 
Huaqiu today shared the view with visiting Gertrude Mongella, 
secretary general of the Fourth World Conference on Women, that 
they would enhance ties and cooperation and make concerted 
efforts for the successful convocation of the conference. 
  During their talks here this morning, Liu, vice-chairman of 
China's organization committee of the fourth women's conference 
and vice-minister of foreign affairs, reviewed the preparatory 
work that China has done over the past one year. 
  He described the conference to be held here in September 
next 
year as a "grand meeting" for the woman representatives from all 
over the world during which the participants will discuss the 
issue on how to raise women's status. 
  Liu said the Chinese Government, as a host, places great 
importance on the conference. 
  He told Mongella that the preparations for the conference 
have been fully conducted according to the plan under the 
leadership of the State Council and the guidance of the 
organization committee of the conference. 
  He said the conference's significance and background have 
been widely popularized in China and the holding of the 
conference here has won powerful support by the people from all 
walks of life. 
  Liu said the preparations that China has made have been 
supported by the United Nations. Both secretary-general and 
deputy secretary- general of the U.N. have introduced China very 
good experiences and raised feasible suggestions. 
  Meanwhile, he said: "Mongella has offered us very good ideas 
in this regard". 
  "It is our inclination to continuously maintain and 
strengthen such cooperative ties," he added. 
  Mongella said she has known more about China's preparations 
for the conference after she made a study tour of Beijing and 
other parts of the country. 
  She said what she has seen during the study tour is that the 
Chinese Government attaches great importance to the conference. 
  The Chinese women have shown their strong self-confidence in 
raising their social status and their great enthusiasm for the 
conference has been supported powerfully, she said, adding that 
this is an important condition for the success of the conference. 
  She expressed the belief that through friendly cooperation 
between the U.N. and the Chinese Government the meeting will 
surely achieve a full success.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Sino-foreign 
cooperation should uphold the principle of being mutually 
beneficial and Marching toward long-term stable relations, 
Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said here today. 
  He made these remarks while meeting with foreign delegates 
attending an international seminar on China's new investment 
style of "B.O.T. (build, operate and transfer)". 
  China's reform and opening to the outside world demand a 
peaceful international environment and China is willing to 
cultivate economic cooperation with foreign nations and 
international organizations, the vice-premier said. 
  Each party should make use of its own strengths in the 
cooperation, he said, adding that many Western countries have 
advanced technology, management systems and abundant capital, 
which could be combined with China's rich natural resources. 
  In addition, he said, China has established a certain 
economic basis. The country also has a huge market potential 
and its labor costs are lower. 
  The combination of both parties will be mutually beneficial, 
he said. 
  The vice-premier told the delegates that China is willing to 
cooperate with foreign partners in various forms, including the 
"B.O.T.", which is quite "acceptable". 
  Senior executives from the World Bank, the Asian Development 
Bank and other international organizations as well as 
internationally prominent companies participated in the seminar, 
which was sponsored by the State Planning Commission.

<F P=106> ["Tiananmen Five Years On" feature from the "Agenda" </F>
section: "Crackdown Continues"] 
  [Text] Five years after tanks thundered into Tiananmen 
Square and troops fired a hail of bullets at protesting 
students, many of the survivors are still suffering in Chinese 
jails. Those arrested after the 1989 campaign were sentenced to 
"reform through labour" for supporting democracy and sitting 
cross-legged with fellow campaigners in the centre of Beijing. 
Today the former idealists are gaunt figures in labour camps, 
beaten and tortured in alleged violation of Chinese law and out 
of the reach of Western aid. 
  But their long, enforced silence may soon be broken. One 
group of 40 former June 4 protesters will publish an 
international appeal for justice this week, contained in a 
letter from Hanying prison to be included in an Amnesty 
International report. "Most of the pro-democracy dissidents are 
still in prison and continue to suffer various kinds of inhuman 
torture," the group wrote to Amnesty. "(Prison authorities have) 
violated the fundamental human rights of prisoners as well as 
international standards on the treatment of political prisoners." 
  The students, workers and intellectuals jailed in the 
aftermath of Tiananmen claim the slaughter of civilians by 
troops acting under martial law has become the violent 
forerunner of more sweeping punishments. Since 1989, while 
China has continued to enjoy Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading 
status with the United States, there has been no official 
statement of regret concerning the killings and no qualification 
of the "rioter" tag slapped on each victim. 
  The appeal comes from Hanying prison, officially known as 
Hubei Provincial No 1 Reform Through Labour Detachment, a large 
camp near Wuhan. It documents incidents of beatings, denial of 
medical care, grim meal rations and systematic crushing of 
attempts at protest. The signatories claim prison guards use 
electric batons and police whips to beat up political prisoners, 
saving their most severe bashings for June 4 democracy activists. 
  "Since the Tiananmen incident of 1989, the Chinese 
authorities have imprisoned tens of thousands of students and 
citizens who were involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations 
and sentenced several thousands," the letter claims. "From the 
day of arrest we are threatened and tortured by the police to 
extract confessions. 
  "In court, political prisoners are deprived of the right to 
defend themselves and given no time to make any statement. 
After being sent to the detention centres or collective 
training stations, we are treated extremely harshly, we are 
underfed and forced to work even when seriously ill. Some 
people become mentally disturbed under such conditions." 
  The prisoners' tale strikes a sharp contrast with last 
week's 
claims by Wang Mingdi, a bureau director in the Justice 
Department, that prison conditions are so good, inmates have 
access to karaoke lounges and art salons. 
  The Hanying prisoners' testimony describes the torture of 
former student Jiang Pinchao, 25, and former writer Lin Zhiyong, 
31, who refused to work and wrote a letter of protest against 
the ill-treatment of a fellow political prisoner. "(They) were 
taken to the brigade office which was often used for physical 
punishment and interrogation of prisoners," the letter reports. 
"One prison officer named Li and several others interrogated 
and beat them both in turn from 9 pm to 1 am the next morning. 
They used police whips and electric batons to rain blows on 
their backs and legs. 
  "They also forced Lin and Jiang to stand with their arms 
raised against the wall for three hours. The two young 
prisoners eventually became so weak that they collapsed and 
fainted. Then the prison guards ordered two criminal prisoners 
to drag them by the hands along the ground for several hundred 
metres. 
  "This caused Jiang's toenails to split, reducing his toes to 
bloody stumps. After the beating they were put into solitary 
confinement. They were both made to wear heavy foot shackles 
and kept in a filthy cage, less than three square metres in 
size." 
  Two days later another prisoner 24-year-old Feng Haiguang, 
was tortured from 7 am to 1 pm for "resisting reform through 
labour". "Feng's legs were so swollen that he was not able to 
walk. He could not sit straight because his back was whipped 
too hard. His body was swollen and bruised, his face was gaunt 
and he claimed that (one of the guards) Peng had beaten him 
until his front teeth were loosened," the inmates wrote. "When 
we saw blood flowing out of his mouth and his clothes which had 
been torn to ribbons during the torture, we could not help 
crying." 
  One democracy activist, shortsighted former student Ye 
Youwen 
26, had failed to stop walking in response to a guard's signal, 
the writers report. The irate guard battered Ye with his 
electric baton until he collapsed, inflicting such damage he was 
unable to eat or drink the next day. Other political detainees 
demanded Ye receive medical treatment, but prison bosses ignored 
the request, they said. 
  "Treatment of political prisoners at Hanying prison compares 
badly even with other prisons in China," the group writes. "For 
breakfast the prison authorities provide about 50 grams of bread 
and some rice gruel, lunch and supper consist of 150 grams of 
rice and a bowl of thin soup. 
  "The small quantity and poor quality of the food, on which 
prisoners are forced to do eight hours heavy labour each day, 
means that many of us are suffering serious health problems. 
  "Our faces have turned yellow and our bodies are thin and 
weak. Those who were ill before they went to prison and those 
who have caught infections in prison suffer physically and 
psychologically. 
  "They have not been given the necessary medical treatment, 
and struggle on the brink of death." 
  Each grim bowl of rice gruel foreshadows a day of sweating 
before a fiery 180 degree furnace, moulding plastic products 
with blistered hands. There are no rest days, no holidays, 
little hope of reprieve, the prisoners report. "We stand at our 
machines in an atmosphere full of poisonous gases and dust, our 
hands protected only by rubber gloves, constantly turning high 
polythene flexible plastic products over a fire which can reach 
180 degrees. 
  "The hands of all of us are covered in huge blisters. We 
work...soaked with sweat...and often have to work at night." 
  The Amnesty International report, titled "China: Human 
Rights Violations Five Years After Tiananmen," to be released on 
Wednesday [1 June], urges Chinese authorities to launch an 
independent inquiry into the reports of torture and 
ill-treatment of prisoners, particularly into conditions and 
treatment at Hanying prison. "In April 1993, Chinese Government 
representatives stated before the United Nations Committee 
Against Torture that all cases of torture were `rigorously' 
investigated in China. There is evidence, however, that few 
cases in fact are," Amnesty reports. 
  The international document will also identify, for the first 
time, scores of civilians shot dead or crushed by tanks in 
Tiananmen Square. As international television cameras rolled, 
troops cut a bloody swathe through crowds of unarmed 
demonstrators, many in their teens or early 20s, who had walked 
or cycled to sit in the square. 
  The new Amnesty list names 75 people -- including a 
nine-year-old boy -- out of the hundreds killed when troops 
"cleared" Tiananmen Square. "Though five years have elapsed 
since the massacre, no public inquiry has yet been held into the 
circumstances in which individuals were killed and the official 
verdict about the `turmoil' is still the same," the human rights 
group reports. 
  It includes details of people shot in Muxidi, a residential 
neighbourhood in west Beijing, of almost a dozen students 
crushed by tanks at dawn on June 4, and of students shot during 
daylight while offering no resistance. Xinhua (New China News 
Agency) trainee Chen Laishun, 23 was shot in the head as he took 
photographs of the scene from the rooftop of the Great Hall of 
the People above Tiananmen Square. 
  Dong Xiaojun, 19, was crushed by a tank as he walked back to 
university after leaving Tiananmen Square. Chemistry student 
Duan Changlong, 24, was bicycling near Mimu Palace on the night 
of June 3 when he came across a confrontation between soldiers 
and crowds. Duan began to mediate in an attempt to defuse the 
stand-off, but a soldier blasted him in the chest with a handgun 
at close range. 
  Journalism graduate Lin Keqin, 22, had been dragging the 
wounded from the gateway of a Muxidi hotel when he was shot in 
the chest. Soldiers sprayed bullets into the head, chest and 
back of nine-year-old Lu Peng as he stood near a bridge at 
midnight on June 3. Men and women, some in their 60s and late 
70s, were shot dead in their homes at Muxidi as troops fired 
indiscriminately on their way to Tiananmen Square. 
  Families who collected their dead were forced to sign forms 
identifying their relatives as "ruffians". In the years since 
Tiananmen, relatives of those killed have been harassed, 
intimidated or dismissed from their jobs for being uneasy with 
the official verdict. 
  The international body urges Beijing to launch an inquiry 
into the killing of unarmed civilians in early June 1989 and 
compensate the scores left crippled or injured after martial law 
took effect on May 20, 1989. "The protests, which were 
essentially peaceful...were officially described after the 
crackdown as a 'counter-revolutionary riot'," Amnesty reports. 
"This official verdict has not been reviewed and is still used 
to justify the imprisonment of many people who are the victims 
of human rights violations."

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (AFP)--Chinese dissident 
intellectual Yu Haocheng left Beijing Saturday for the United 
States, more than three years after he first applied to the 
authorities here for an exit visa, his wife said. "Yu left this 
morning on a Northwest Airlines flight for New York," where he 
is to take up a research and teaching post at Columbia 
University, his wife said. 
  A leading expert on constitutional law, the 68-year-old Yu 
was placed under house arrest in the northern suburbs of Beijing 
for more than one year after the June 1989 pro-democracy 
crackdown. On May 14, 1989, Yu had joined 11 other 
intellectuals in a public appeal to the government to declare 
the student-led pro-democracy campaign "a patriotic democracy 
movement." 
  Formerly a director of the Public Security Department's 
Masses Publishing House, Yu was effectively forced into 
retirement in 1986 for allegedly publishing "questionable" books 
and advocating political and legal reforms. 
  Since his release from house arrest in late 1990, he 
continued to speak out on the need for fundamental legal reforms 
and to publish dissident-style views in the foreign media. Yu's 
repeated applications to leave China so that he might accept 
invitations from abroad had previously all been turned down, but 
he finally received a passport on May 9. The decision to grant 
Yu a passport was widely seen as as a gesture to the United 
States in the run up to President Bill Clinton's decision on 
whether to renew China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading 
status. Freedom to leave China had been one of the conditions 
set by Washington for MFN renewal. 
  Clinton renewed China's MFN Thursday with only limited 
sanctions, and abandoned his policy of linking trade issues with 
human rights.

  [Excerpt] Beijing police resumed their harassment of 
dissidents' relatives immediately after the United States 
renewed China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status last 
week. Police moved into position outside the home of Chen 
Zihua, sister of released political prisoner Chen Ziming, early 
on Friday [27 May ] morning, hours after US President Bill 
Clinton announced that he was severing the link between human 
rights and MFN renewal. A police car and six uniformed officers 
remained in position until 2 am, closely monitoring the family's 
activities. 
  It was the first time Chen's family had been put under 
surveillance since the National Peoples' Congress met in Beijing 
in March. Chen was released two weeks ago on medical parole 
after serving nearly five years of a 13-year sentence, in a move 
seen as concession to the Clinton administration in order to win 
MFN renewal. However, Chen was not allowed to return home and 
was forced instead to leave Beijing with his wife and parents. 
He is not expected to return until after the fifth anniversary 
of the June 4 crackdown. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 KYODO -- A Beijing family whose son 
was shot dead five years ago during pro-democracy demonstrations 
in Tiananmen Square when the army marched on the city has 
demanded that police stop harassing them and let their son rest 
in peace. 
  Jiang Peikun, professor at the prestigious People's 
University, sent a letter to the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress demanding that plainclothes police 
end a 10-day vigil outside his apartment. 
  In the letter, Jiang and his wife said they would stage a 
hunger strike from Thursday if police surveillance was not 
stopped. 
  Jiang Jielian was killed by a bullet in the back on the eve 
of June 3, 1989, a day after his 17th birthday. 
  His death was one of what could have been thousands of 
people 
killed by soldiers of the People's Liberation Army which was 
ordered by the Chinese Government to quell six weeks of 
pro-democracy protests. 
  "We demand a little human sympathy, we demand to know what 
humanity is. Who cannot understand the significance that a day 
like this holds for us? The love parents have for their son is 
known by all," the letter said. 
  "This year marks the fifth anniversary of the death of our 
son, his ashes and other belongings still remain in the house. 
Is there not even one peaceful place where his spirit can rest? 
Cannot his parents have even a little peace?" It said. 
  Jiang said the police harass everyone who visits their house 
and that even his son-in-law was followed and then searched by 
police who suspected him of smuggling papers or information 
concerning the names and addresses of other victims of the 
killings out of the house. 
  Ding Ziling, Jiang's wife, is believed to have made efforts 
to find out who and how many people were killed in those fateful 
June days, press reports said. 
  The government has said some 300 people were killed, 
including police and soldiers torn apart by angry citizens, but 
five years after the killings a name list has yet to be 
published. 
  Police presence in Beijing has been tight since March and is 
expected to increase this week as the anniversary of the June 
event falls on Friday and Saturday with government fears of 
renewed protests mounting.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] In a sign of just how nervous the authorities are 
in the run-up to the Beijing massacre anniversary, police are 
carrying their battle for social stability even into areas which 
do not impinge upon state security -- like fun. 
  Last Saturday night, public security literally pulled the 
plug on a party at Ritan Park, in Beijing's diplomatic area, for 
an American journalist preparing to return to the United States 
at the end of an assignment in China. 
  Just a few hours before hundreds of foreigners and Chinese, 
including some prominent figures in the world of film and music, 
were due to arrive, the restaurant managers announced that there 
was an electricity overload and the lights went out. Apparently 
taking instructions from the police, the managers would not 
allow a private electrician in to fix the problem and they 
rejected the idea of a party by candlelight. 
  Later, the entire road leading to the restaurant was blocked 
off by uniformed police, and nearly a dozen plain-clothes 
security agents guarded the restaurant itself until late that 
night, even after the party had moved to another venue. But the 
managers of that nightspot also seemed to have been warned off, 
and refused to sell disco tickets to Chinese guests. 
  Beijing is always tense around the time of the massacre 
anniversary, but this year residents have been struck by the 
bizarre extremes to which the authorities have been going. 
Among other things, officials have reportedly cancelled a 
charity bazaar, an art exhibition and a tennis club dinner, all 
sponsored by foreign embassies. 
  The Foreign Ministry last week called in a Western news 
agency and warned its reporters not to talk to dissidents, their 
families or friends, or other "sensitive persons". The ministry 
reminded the journalists of a rule, which had not been strictly 
enforced, that requires official approval for all interviews 
with private citizens. If the journalists disobeyed, the 
ministry said it would not be able to help them should trouble 
arise. 
  Dissidents had spoken privately for months about 
commemorating the fifth anniversary of the massacre, and there 
is still talk that some activities may take place to mark the 
date. But it is hard to see how they will be able to carry off 
any plans now, given the tight security. 
  Some dissidents, such as student leader Wang Dan, have left 
town to avoid trouble. Those that remain in the capital find 
themselves under heavy guard. The dissident Ding Zilin, for 
example, said that security agents had begun following her again 
after having left her alone for the previous few weeks. 
  "They're more open about it now," said Ms Ding. When she 
visited the doctor last week, two unmarked Mercedes-Benz cars 
filled with police agents followed behind her vehicle and a 
police motorcycle went ahead of her. When she takes the bus, 
plain-clothes agents follow her on and off. 
  On Saturday, a Chinese friend was searched by campus 
security 
for half an hour after visiting Ms Ding, who lives at the 
People's University, and Jiang Qisheng, a university PhD who was 
jailed for 1-1/2 years after the Tiananmen massacre, went 
missing after going to Ms Ding's home two days ago. 
  Ms Ding yesterday issued a statement to the Government 
saying 
she and her husband would go on a hunger strike from June 2 to 4 
unless plain-clothes agents stopped harassing them. Ms Ding's 
17-year-old child was killed in the massacre. "We are people who 
should not be penned up like animals in a zoo," she said. 
  In recent days, the entire security apparatus has been 
making 
its presence felt, as a threat to the population if nothing else.

<F P=106> [Article by special reporter Ti An (4895 1344): "Dissident </F>
Chen Ziming is Recuperating at a Hot Springs Resort, and Bao 
Zunxin Complains About High Medical Costs"] 
  [Text] The fifth anniversary of the June 4th incident is a 
very sensitive date for the Beijing authorities. Recently, 
public security personnel could be seen outside the houses of 
some well-known democracy activists in Beijing; they stood 
guard, watched them, and followed them closely. It is believed 
that they want to restrict contacts between the dissidents and 
foreign reporters. Some democracy activists, including former 
student leader Wang Dan and the old scholar Xu Liangying and his 
wife, have had short trips arranged by the authorities to areas 
outside Beijing to avoid "June 4," a date which causes concern 
among the authorities. 
  Chen Ziming, an intellectual who has just been released, is 
staying outside Beijing with his wife Wang Zhihong; they have 
gone to a hot springs resort to recuperate. A medical 
examination found that Chen Ziming has hypertension and a heart 
problem (Chen Ziming's blood pressure is too high, over 100), 
however, Chen Ziming's skin disease, which was not able to heal 
in jail, has improved a bit after days of immersion in the hot 
springs water (Chen Ziming had not taken a bath in a whole year 
while in jail, and as he could only rub his body with water, his 
skin disease got worse). 
  It is believed that Chen Ziming and his wife can only return 
to Beijing after the fifth anniversary of the "June 4th" 
incident. His family said that after Chen Ziming returns to 
Beijing, he must visit the hospital for a thorough medical 
examination. In addition, Chen Ziming wants to complete a book 
on China's modernization--a book he started writing in jail; at 
present, he has almost finished writing the book. 
  When Chen Ziming was in jail, his wife Wang Zhihong and his 
sister Chen Zihua made a living by doing temporary jobs. 
  Chen Ziming was originally president of the Beijing Research 
Institute of Social Sciences and Economics, a nongovernmental 
think tank. According to his family, Chen Ziming, after several 
years of hardship in jail, remains loyal to his view on the 
country's affairs and has not changed his beliefs. 
  Bao Zunxin, another intellectual who was jailed for his part 
in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was a historian at the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; he has not been able to 
regain his job so far and has been ill. Therefore, he relies on 
his wife and daughter to earn wages to support the family, and 
this means he has greater difficulties in his life. 
  Bao Zunxin's health was affected by his imprisonment. Since 
he was released at the end of November 1992, he has been 
recuperating up to this moment. Last week, he had a minor 
operation to remove a polyp from his colon. He sighed and said 
that medical costs in Beijing are very expensive and he cannot 
afford it; for example, a visit to the doctor to treat influenza 
costs more than 80 yuan, so he usually does not go to see the 
doctor when he has influenza and just takes medicine prepared by 
a pharmacy. 
  Bao Zunxin hopes to continue his academic research, and he 
is 
writing an article on the history of thought during the late 
Qing period. 
  As the fifth anniversary of "June 4th" draws closer, two 
public security personnel have appeared in front of Bao Zunxin's 
house to watch him. He was forbidden from leaving to buy 
vegetables, but he insisted on going out, and the public 
security personnel let him go but followed him at all times. 
  In another development, apart from Wang Dan, who will leave 
Beijing to avoid "June 4th," the well-known intellectuals Xu 
Liangying and his wife have also had to leave Beijing 
temporarily as a result of arrangements by the authorities. 
According to their family, the Xu couple left Beijing last 
Wednesday (25 May) for a certain locality, and will return to 
Beijing on or after 8 June. 
  As for other young and middle-aged intellectuals who were 
jailed for their part in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, such 
as Liu Xiaobo and Min Qi, they are in Beijing but feel bored and 
can only amuse themselves by playing cards.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 29 May (XINHUA) -- The people's courts 
have concluded the trials on two major smuggling cases in Rushan 
city, Shandong Province and Zhuhai city, Guangdong Province. 
With the approval of the Supreme People's Court, Liu Qishan, 
Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning, who were charged with smuggling, and 
accepting and offering bribes in the smuggling case of the 
Rushan Commerce Bureau, and Yang Mingji, who was charged with 
smuggling in Zhuhai's cigarette smuggling case, were executed by 
shooting in Weihai and Zhuhai, respectively, today. 
  Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, 
announced this result of the people's courts' verdicts at a news 
briefing on harshly punishing major smugglers today. 
  It has been learned that the cigarette smuggling case in 
Rushan is a serious one in which smugglers and law enforcers 
colluded with each other, and the smuggling activity was covered 
up by armed personnel. In July 1993, Fan Zhanwu, political 
commissar of the frontier security subbureau under the Weihai 
Public Security Bureau, and Liu Ning, deputy director of the 
operation department, worked out an "emergency circular on the 
issues concerning smuggling units' surrendering themselves to 
the police according to stipulations," which provided that 
smuggling units that "turn themselves in" to the Weihai Frontier 
Security Subbureau will be "fined" on the principle that they 
still "keep their capital." To keep their previous promises, 
Fan and Liu separately released this information to Liu Qishan, 
director of the Rushan City Commerce Bureau, who had bribed them 
many times, and implied that he may take this chance to engage 
in smuggling. No sooner had Liu Qishan and others got the hint 
than they contacted smugglers in South China to smuggle 
cigarettes. On 16 July, when Liu Qishan was informed that the 
boat loaded with smuggled cigarettes was on the high seas, he 
immediately dispatched Jiang Hai, an employee of the commerce 
bureau, to go through the procedures of "turning oneself in" at 
the frontier security subbureau, whereas Fan Zhanwu dispatched 
Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Weidong to bring three persons, 
carrying four submachine guns, to greet the boat off Rushan 
City. Before Wang Weidong and his men embarked, Liu Qishan gave 
them 5,000 yuan as "labor money" and demanded that they 
underreport the quantity of smuggled cigarettes. On the 
afternoon of 19 July, Wang Weidong and the other three armed 
persons escorted the boat loaded with over 9,900 cases of 
smuggled cigarettes to the wharf of Rushan Port, and Sun Xiping 
and Wang Xuefeng, persons in charge of the Rushan Public 
Security Bureau, brought some 20 policemen and three police cars 
to the wharf to "maintain order" at the request of Liu Qishan. 
  On the same afternoon, customs officers had twice rushed to 
the wharf of Rushan Port to seize the smuggled goods and halt 
the unloading, but were stopped by Fan Zhanwu on both occasions. 
To avoid armed conflicts, the customs officers withdrew after 
reaching an agreement with Fan Zhanwu and others that the 
cigarettes should not be unloaded, the boat should not leave the 
wharf, and that someone be assigned to keep watch on the boat. 
After the customs officers left, Wang Xuefeng, who was in 
charge of the lookout for the boat, called Liu Qishan, who 
immediately organized the unloading and sale of the smuggled 
cigarettes. The smuggled cigarettes were able to be unloaded 
and sold because Yan Shili, director of the operation department 
under the frontier security subbureau, had ignored the higher 
authorities' ban on unloading the cigarettes during the 
unloading. After that, only 3,000 cases of smuggled cigarettes 
were sealed up, as Liu Qishan planned, to cope with the 
investigation of relevant departments. The whole smuggling 
activity was covered up. 
  After the case was reported, Wang Jianzhi, secretary of the 
Rushan City party committee, heard an overall briefing by Liu 
Qishan and helped Liu Qishan and others avoid legal punishment 
by repeatedly inciting Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and others to 
come up with measures for self-protection and synchronize their 
story to conceal the facts. 
  In addition, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, Liu Ning, Wang Jianzhi, 
and others had, on many occasions, extorted or accepted large 
sums of bribes from others. Among which, Liu Qishan received 
over 62,000 Renminbi in bribes; Fan Zhanwu, over 154,000 yuan; 
Liu Ning, over 258,000 yuan; and Wang Jianzhi, over 221,000 yuan. 
  After the public trial, in accordance with the law, the 
intermediate people's court of Weihai City reached a verdict of 
the first instance on the 11 defendants involved in the Rushan 
smuggling case, sentencing Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning 
to death; sentencing Wang Jianzhi, defendant of the same case, 
to death with a two-year reprieve; sentencing Sun Xiping to life 
imprisonment, Wang Xuefeng and Yan Shili to a fixed-term 
imprisonment of 20 years, Wang Weidong and Qiu Guojian to a 
fixed-term imprisonment of five years, and Jiang Hai to a 
fixed-term imprisonment of three years with a three-year 
reprieve. At the same time, the court also fined the Rushan 
City Bureau of Commerce, which was guilty of smuggling, 100,000 
yuan. After the court reached the verdict of the first 
instance, Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, Liu Ning, Wang Jianzhi, and 
others disagreed with the verdict and filed an appeal. After 
rejecting the appeal, the Higher People's Court of Shandong 
decided on 11 May 1994 to maintain the original verdict. The 
Supreme People's Court approved the death sentence for Liu 
Qishan, Fan Zhanwu, and Liu Ning on 23 May. 
  In February 1993, Yang Mingji, former head of Sanzao Border 
Brigade, concurrently head of its antismuggling group, under the 
border branch of the Zhuhai City Public Security Bureau of 
Guangdong Province, colluded with smugglers in smuggling 
cigarettes from Macao to be sold in Zhuhai. According to the 
agreement, Yang Mingji was to provide armed cover for the 
smugglers, for which he received cover fees. From 8 to 28 
March, on four occasions, uniformed police carrying arms, 
including Lin Shouru, under Yang Mingji's leadership or 
dispatched by him, drove a speedboat to sea to provide armed 
cover to freighters engaged in smuggling cigarettes and escorted 
them to the Sanzao Dock. They also helped the smugglers sell 
cigarettes. A total of 2,300 boxes of cigarettes were smuggled, 
worth 5.17 million yuan. Yang Mingji and others received 
172,000 yuan protection fees, and Yang himself got 48,000 yuan. 
  The intermediate court of Zhuhai City reached a verdict of 
the instance, sentencing Yang Mingji and Lin Shouru to death. 
Yang and Lin disagreed the verdict and filed an appeal. The 
Higher People's Court of Guangdong Province rejected the appeal, 
kept the original verdict, and reported, according to law, to 
the Supreme People's Court for approval. 
  At the news briefing, Zhu Mingshan said: The antismuggling 
struggle is a long-term and arduous task. Relevant departments 
should coordinate closely, resolutely combat local protectionism 
and departmental protectionism, work hard to enforce law 
strictly, and spare no effort to punish smugglers and criminals. 
At the same time, it is imperative to apply party disciplinary 
rules and state laws to strictly deal with those who intercede 
for law-breakers through bribery, who interfere with the 
handling of cases, and who protect and wink at smugglers, in 
order to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening to the 
outside world, and economic construction.

  [Text] The Supreme People's Court has announced its 
decision on severely punishing, in accordance with the law, 
criminals involved in the two major smuggling cases in Rushan 
and Zhuhai cities. The two cases involved huge amounts of 
smuggled goods, and the circumstances of the crimes were vile. 
The first case also involved such offenses as offering and 
accepting bribes and bending the law for personal gain. Among 
the offenders were leading cadres of leadership bodies of party 
and government and law-enforcement departments, including the 
head of a commerce bureau, the political commissar of a border 
subbureau, a deputy head of a border brigade, and the secretary 
of a city CPC committee. Violations by those who know the law 
and are themselves in charge of carrying it out are incompatible 
with legal principles. Popular indignation will not be assuaged 
if they are not harshly punished in accordance with the law of 
the land. 
  The serious way in which the two major smuggling cases was 
investigated and punished represents an achievement of the 
anticorruption drive. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out 
explicitly: "Party members, high- and middle-ranking cadres in 
particular, must heighten their awareness and set a good example 
by being honest and observing discipline. As for those corrupt 
elements, we must punish them in accordance with state laws and 
party discipline, no matter who they are. We must not tolerate 
or abet their wrongdoing." The Rushan city case was a serious 
instance of providing an armed escort for smuggling, in which 
the smugglers worked hand in glove with a handful of 
law-enforcement personnel and local cadres who offered 
assistance and who helped cover it up. The case in Zhuhai city 
was one of providing an armed escort for smuggling in which the 
smugglers worked in collusion with a law-enforcement official 
who abused his power for personal gain. From these two cases, 
we can see how rampant the crime of smuggling has become; from 
the severe punishment that the offenders in the two cases 
received, we can see the firm determination of the CPC Central 
Committee to tackle major cases in the anticorruption drive and 
the effective measures it has taken in this regard. Facts have 
shown that any violation of the law, regardless of who the 
perpetrator is and where it takes place, will be punished by the 
law. Any violator, even those who made contributions to reform 
and construction, must be prosecuted according to the law. All 
citizens are equal before the law -- this is the fundamental 
principle of the socialist legal system. 
  Smuggling is a serious economic crime that eludes the 
state's 
administration of international trade and that illegally rakes 
in extraordinary profits. The crime of smuggling batters the 
domestic market, harms the development of national industries, 
obstructs normal international trade, disrupts the economic 
order, corrupts social conduct, contaminates the ranks of 
cadres, and tarnishes national sovereignty and dignity. For 
this reason, the crime of smuggling is a major political issue 
as well as a major economic issue. 
  The fact that the crime of smuggling has, in spite of 
repeated injunctions, gone from bad to worse and even drawn in 
many leading cadres and law-enforcement personnel -- as has been 
amply demonstrated -- can be attributed to the mistaken 
understanding of some leading cadres, to the bad practice of 
protecting small-group interests in some localities and 
departments, and to the widespread corruption in some government 
and law-enforcement organs. Local protectionism and 
departmental cover-ups have served as, intentionally or not, 
"air raid shelters" or "umbrellas" for smuggling crimes. A 
handful of localities or departments put local or departmental 
interests above overall national interests by following the 
practice of "countering a central measure with a local one" to 
undermine the overall national interest. This is very wrong and 
will lead to dangers if it is allowed to develop unchecked. From 
the Rushan case, we can see that these offenders were not, as 
they themselves claimed, "dedicated heart and soul to the public 
interest" or that "no money went into their pockets." They are 
rather unclean and are guilty of, in addition to smuggling, a 
whole bunch of economic offenses including taking bribes. Past 
experience and lessons told us that we must set strict demands 
on cadres in accordance with party discipline and state laws, 
educate them on keeping the cardinal principles in mind, take 
the overall situation into account, and place the fundamental 
interests of the state and the people above everything else. 
Strictness embodies real care, while toleration will lead to 
the destruction of many cadres, which would mean losses far 
greater and more unfortunate than economic losses. 
  Some people contend as if smuggling, whether carried out 
either openly or on the sly, should be tolerated in order to 
develop a socialist market economy. Some localities even come 
up with the ridiculous theory of "prosperity through smuggling." 
They are only finding excuses for smuggling. To develop a 
socialist market economy, we must have strict standards and a 
sound legal system. Moreover, we must also strengthen and 
improve macroeconomic regulation and control, safeguard the 
uniform implementation of the decrees of the central government, 
and ensure a normal order in economic operations and social 
life. Every country in the world without exception strictly 
bans and cracks down hard on smuggling. There has never been a 
country that has established a socialist market economy and that 
has accomplished an economic takeoff on the strength of 
smuggling. Just think, if we allow -- in the course of reform, 
opening up, and establishing a socialist market economy -- 
smuggling to run rampant and people to fatten themselves by 
undermining the interests of the state, then who will want to 
work honestly or engage in legitimate business? Which foreigner 
will then want to come here to set up factories or do business? 
  The lesson to be learned from these two smuggling cases is 
profound and thought-provoking. In the important talks he gave 
when he visited the south in 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: 
"We should pay persistent attention to two tasks--the 
continuation of reform and opening and a crackdown on various 
crimes. Both tasks require tenacious efforts. The attack on 
various criminal activities and the elimination of a variety of 
hideous phenomena allow no leniency." As China has entered a 
new phase of economic restructuring -- a phase of combining a 
package of reforms with breakthroughs in key areas -- this year, 
it is of great significance to properly handle the relations 
between reform, development, and stability and to perform the 
various tasks well. Only when we attend to the two tasks with 
equally tenacious efforts will we be able to truly seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, 
and ensure stability. Only then will we be able to ensure that 
the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics will advance from victory to victory.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The "PEOPLE'S DAILY" 
[RENMIN RIBAO], China's leading national newspaper, in an 
editorial today stressed once again that it is necessary to 
severely crack down upon the crime of smuggling. 
  The Chinese Supreme People's Court made public Sunday [29 
May] two serious cases of smuggling at Rushan City in east 
China's Shandong Province and at Zhuhai City in south China's 
Guangdong Province, respectively. Four principals in the two 
cigarette-smuggling cases, including one government official and 
three frontier police officers, were executed Sunday morning. 
  The crimes were committed by smugglers in cahoots with 
officers of law enforcement bodies. They carried out their 
criminal activities under armed escort and protection from some 
local officials. "This shows that smuggling activities are 
rampant," the editorial said. 
  Noting that the criminals in the two cases have all been 
severely punished, the newspaper said that "this demonstrates 
the firm determination of the central authorities in the 
struggle against corruption. 
  "Anyone violating the law, no matter who, where and in which 
department he is, will be punished in accordance with the law." 
  The editorial pointed out that smuggling is an illegal 
economic activity that can severely disrupt the domestic market, 
the nation's industry, international trade, the economic order 
and the general confidence of society. It has a specially 
corrosive effect on cadres. Therefore, it added, the crime of 
smuggling is not only an economic problem but also a political 
problem. 
  The editorial said that experience has shown that smuggling 
is a growing problem in certain places despite the central 
government's repeated orders banning smuggling. It is precisely 
because some local officials and officers of law enforcement 
bodies have been involved in such criminal activities, that some 
local officials have taken the attitude that they can run their 
localities as their own fiefdoms, and that corruption has become 
rampant in some local government departments and law-enforcement 
bodies. 
  A few localities and departments have put their own 
interests 
above the national interests, the newspaper said. 
  The editorial also pointed out that it is a mere pretext for 
smuggling activities when some people argue that in the process 
of developing a socialist market economy a blind eye should be 
turned to smuggling. It stressed that in order to develop a 
socialist market economy it is necessary to establish a strict 
and complete legal system, and severely crack down on smuggling 
activities.

<F P=106> [By FAZHI RIBAO reporter Xu Lai (1776 0171) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Zhang Yinshu (1728 6892 2562)] 
  [Text] Hefei, 29 May (XINHUA) -- At a third national 
criminal prosecution conference which ended today, Liang 
Guoqing, deputy procurator general of the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, stressed: Procuratorial organs at all levels 
across the country must practically give first priority to 
maintaining political and social stability, strictly enforce the 
law, vigorously investigate and handle cases, sternly punish 
those committing acts of corruption and bribery, and crack down 
on various criminal activities according to the law in order to 
provide a favorable legal environment for reform and economic 
development. 
  It has been learned that from January to April, 
procuratorial 
organs at all levels across the country prosecuted at people's 
courts 5,634 cases of economic crimes, including cases of 
corruption and bribery, involving 6,738 persons of whom 115 were 
cadres at or above the county or department level. 
Procuratorial organs in various localities also promptly 
arrested and prosecuted a number of gangster-robbers, rapists, 
and other gang criminals according to the law. At the same 
time, procuratorial organs at various levels promptly arrested 
and prosecuted a number of highwaymen and train robbers who had 
done great harm to society, thus initially changing the 
situation for the better in some key areas and key sections of 
highways and railways. Cases of smuggling by units were 
investigated and handled. From January to April, 35 major cases 
of smuggling involving legal persons were directly investigated 
and handled by procuratorial organs. 
  Liang Guoqing pointed out: Political and social stability 
now 
prevail in our country. However, public order has yet to be 
strengthened in some localities. He said: Social evils are 
often accompanied by grave crimes, serious acts of fraud -- 
especially financial and commercial fraud -- and crimes 
committed by legal figures that seriously jeopardize public 
order. Criminals often collude with members of some units, and 
the latter go along with the former in their evil deeds. He 
called on procuratorial organs at all levels to link the effort 
to crack down on serious crimes with the struggle against 
corruption. He also called on them to vigorously prosecute 
cases of economic crimes, including cases of corruption and 
bribery, and crack down on such criminal activities. 
  Liang Guoqing stressed: In the near future, procuratorial 
organs should select a number of major, influential cases for 
prosecution at people's courts in order to create a strong 
momentum in cracking down on criminal offenses and crimes of 
corruption and bribery. 
  At the conference, leaders of provincial, autonomous 
regional, and municipal people's procuratorates also discussed 
questions such as arrests, prosecutions in court, and protests 
by procuratorial organs.

<F P=106> [Sixth in series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F>
Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 
7160): "Qigong, Embroidery, and Psychological Corrective 
Therapy"--Part 5 was published in the 25 May China DAILY REPORT] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Many 
criminals serving their terms in prison find it difficult to 
quit their bad habits due to the weaknesses in their character 
and psychology. In response to this, China's prisons have found 
many extremely characteristic corrective methods in the course 
of practice. 
<H5>  Qigong Corrective Therapy </H5>
  Every morning and evening, at the gate of Shanghai Municipal 
Prison, one can find several lines of female prisoners 
attentively practicing qigong to soft and relaxing music. After 
practicing qigong for three years or more, many female prisoners 
find that their health has obviously improved and their 
willpower has strengthened. 
  Several years ago, Shanghai Municipal Prison and the 
Municipal Qigong Scientific Research Institute were already 
cooperating in exploring the practical corrective effect of 
qigong in the reform of criminals, and their qigong training 
topics on violent criminals and sex offenders have recently been 
included as research subjects for this year by the China Medical 
Association. 
  Violent criminals have an irritable and bellicose character. 
They are ready to fight at the slightest provocation. The 
prison authorities insist on having them practice slow "calming" 
qigong. After several months, their irritable temper can be 
effectively corrected. As for sex offenders, qigong training is 
of particular significance in stabilizing their emotions, 
creates a fine psychological environment, and optimizes their 
psychological mechanisms. By practicing qigong, senile 
prisoners can have their symptoms of senility improved or 
completely eliminated. Moreover, their minds can be broadened 
and their self-control increased. 
<H5>  Embroidery Corrective Therapy </H5>
  Early this year, Sun Chenggong had his prison term reduced. 
He had been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for theft, 
robbery, and harming and hindering the execution of public 
affairs. He was dissatisfied with the sentence when he was sent 
to Shandong Beishu Prison and made an attempt to escape. 
  A small embroidery needle has changed his life. He told this 
reporter that after he had been caught again in an escape 
attempt, instructing cadres had him learn embroidery. He said 
that he was not used to it at the beginning and felt 
uncomfortable sitting just for a short while, but that later he 
slowly mastered embroidery and his temper changed a lot. 
  Having bellicose and energetic violent criminals learn 
embroidery, training their characters, and correcting their 
behavior is a new method found by Beishu Prison in the practice 
of reforming criminals. At an embroidery workshop, dozens of 
male criminals quietly do embroidery work with their needles and 
thread. They are not inferior to females in speed. A young 
criminal said: This is also labor. Except for using the eyes, 
it is lighter than other jobs. Moreover, I am energetic by 
nature. I hated sitting, but embroidery can help reform me. 
<H5>  Psychological Corrective Therapy </H5>
  In-prison psychological counseling was initiated in Western 
countries as early as in the twenties and thirties. Although 
exploration of the feasibility of in-prison psychological 
counseling has been carried out for only three to five years in 
China, it is now being extensively adopted in prisons across 
China. 
  According to a survey by Shanghai Municipal Prison, a 
criminal entering a strange prison from the familiarity of 
society will often be psychologically unbalanced and depressed 
and feel at a loss or even tired of life. The incidence of the 
psychology [as published] and cognitive retardation among 
criminals is obviously higher than that among ordinary people. 
The psychological problems of criminals not only hinder their 
admission of guilt and observance of law and their reform, but 
also bring difficulties to prison management. 
  In addition to offering special out-patient psychological 
counseling services, Shanghai Municipal Prison also demands that 
instructing cadres have some mastery of the knowledge of 
psychology. It has also achieved good results in organizing a 
series of studies on knowledge of psychology among prisoners so 
that they can come to understand themselves and judge people and 
things around them from a rational angle and so that they can 
use psychology to explain the inexplicable phenomena and 
feelings that once affected them and thus enhance the awareness 
of reform.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (AFP)--The Chinese government 
denied Monday a report by the Tibet Information Network (TIN) 
that hundreds of people had demonstrated Saturday in Lhasa, the 
Tibetan capital. 
  "No incident of this kind occurred, according to our 
information," a government spokesman for the Tibet Autonomous 
Region said by telephone. He made no other comment. 
  TIN, a London-based agency that monitors human rights and 
developments in Tibet, said Sunday that between 200 and 300 
people had protested in Lhasa against an increase in taxes for 
shopkeepers. 
  Several demonstrators were beaten up and five were arrested, 
TIN said, adding that three foreigners who witnessed the 
incident had had their passports confiscated. 
  Accounts garnered from foreign tourists who have recently 
been in Tibet say the situation in Lhasa is still very tense, 
and the Chinese police and military have high-profile 
deployments there. 
  The Chinese authorities are apparently concerned that 
anti-Chinese sentiment among Tibetans is being inflamed by 
inflation and unemployment, the sources say. 
  In May 1993, demonstrations erupted against rising prices 
and 
quickly degenerated into protests against China's occupation of 
Tibet. 
  China annexed Tibet in 1959 after crushing a 
pro-independence 
movement. 
  According to human rights organisations, hundreds of Tibetan 
dissidents are in Chinese jails, many of them arrested after a 
wave of anti-Chinese rallies in 1987.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- At a national telephone 
conference on the inspection of the Statistics Law enforcement 
tonight, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said that effective measures 
should be taken in a timely fashion to stop negative and corrupt 
behavior, such as daring to defy the law, seriously running 
counter to the party's ideological line of seeking truth from 
facts, and practicing fraud in statistics data. He urged all 
localities and departments to put inspection work high on the 
agenda and try to achieve practical results. 
  Zou Jiahua said: In light of the guiding spirit of the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
concerning resolutely combating fraud and proneness to boasting 
and exaggeration and striving to improve the work of statistical 
and administrative supervision and auditing supervision, the 
State Statistical Bureau, the Supervision Ministry, and the 
Legislative Affairs Bureau are launching a nationwide inspection 
of the Statistics Law enforcement. The inspection drive is 
important to correcting the party's work style and guaranteeing 
the state's scientific decision-making and modern management. 
Meanwhile, the inspection drive also plays an important role in 
strengthening the building of the Statistics Law system and in 
pushing forward the reform of statistics work. 
  Zou Jiahua continued: Since the promulgation of the 
Statistics Law, China has achieved great results in statistics 
work over the past 10 years and more. Meanwhile, we should have 
a clear understanding of the existing problems. At present, 
phenomena such as being late in filing statistics reports or 
refusing to file them at all are very flagrant. The practices 
of boasting, exaggeration, and fraud, mainly caused by the 
changes of the interest pattern, begin to emerge in some 
localities and units and become very serious in some localities. 
Resolute efforts should be made to stop such behaviors. 
Otherwise, these practices will lead to incorrect statistical 
data, which in turn will cause the state to make wrong 
macroeconomic decisions and bring about serious consequences to 
economic development. 
  Zou Jiahua said: While carrying out this inspection, first 
of all, localities and departments should make great efforts to 
strengthen the educational campaign to publicize and enforce the 
Statistics Law. Any one, including party and government leaders 
whose jobs are related to statistics work, should learn, 
understand, conscientiously observe, and strictly carry out the 
Statistics Law. While carrying out this inspection, we should 
conduct a thoroughgoing investigation of the new situations and 
problems in implementing the Statistics Law and sum them up. 
Great efforts should be made to amend the law to improve the 
statistics legal system. It is necessary to conscientiously sum 
up practical experiences at home and boldly borrow foreign 
countries' successful practices. We should strive to be 
specific and concrete in setting up our statistics requirements. 
In this way, we can establish a supervision and control 
mechanics that will enable us to guide, push forward, and 
guarantee the smooth progress of the statistics work reform to 
prevent and eradicate the corruptive phenomena of artificially 
imposed obstacles and frauds. 
  Zou Jiahua stressed: The following people will be severely 
punished--anyone who refuses to perform statistics obligations, 
who is late in reporting statistics data or refuses to report 
statistics data, who files incorrect statistics data, who 
fabricates or changes statistics data, who forces or incites 
statistics organizations or personnel to practice fraud in 
statistics data, who fabricates statistics data to cover up 
serious mistakes or fish for honor, position, or other personal 
objectives, who brings about losses or bad consequences to the 
interests of the state and the people, who retaliates against 
those who dare to adhere to the principle and expose violators 
of the Statistics Law, and who obstructs those who conduct 
investigations on illegal statistics practices. If a case is 
particularly severe, it will be exposed in the newspapers. We 
should ensure that whenever a wrong practice is dealt with, all 
the people will learn from it.

(2621 1696 3046)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA)--"Wan Li on Urban 
Development" was published in Beijing today. At a ceremony 
marking the book's publication, Li Ruihuan, member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, said: In urban 
development, we must pay heed to long-term benefits. We must 
not pursue only speed and economic benefits, disregarding 
environmental benefits. 
  Li Ruihuan said: The publication of "Wan Li on Urban 
Development" marks a major event in China's urban and rural 
development. Following the republic's founding, the focus of our 
work shifted from rural to urban areas. Although we were not 
totally ignorant of urban planning, development, and 
administration, we were indeed not very well informed. After 40 
years of real experience, we have scored tremendous progress and 
accumulated a wealth of experience in this regard. At the same 
time, we have also learned quiet a few lessons. 
  Comrade Wan Li had many years of leadership experience in 
urban development. "Wan Li on Urban Development" -- a 
collection of 48 speeches and written instructions on urban 
development written by Wan Li between 1956 and 1993 -- offers an 
incisive summing-up of the republic's good and bad experience in 
urban development. Li Ruihuan said: Every comrade in charge of 
urban development work, leading comrades in particular, should 
carefully study this book and use it as guidance in summing up 
our historical experience and solving the immediate problems. 
  Li Ruihuan stressed in his speech: Historical experience 
shows that we are more prone to mistakes when we carry out 
massive economic construction and accelerate urban development 
across the board. There are indeed cadres who are rather 
ignorant of urban planning. Unwilling to put in some efforts to 
study it or listen to people's criticism with an open mind, they 
often pay attention only to local, immediate interests to the 
neglect of long-term interests. They stress only economic 
benefits and not environmental benefits, only the utility 
functions and not the aesthetic effects, and they blindly 
imitate foreign styles and belittle national traditions. In 
some cities, too many high-rise buildings were built and their 
layout was irrational. Shoddy outward embellishment will cause 
endless trouble in later years. The colors used were 
incongruous and no attention was paid to balance. The green 
areas are small and untidy. All these phenomena are worrisome. 
Urban development has a great impact on overall national 
development and on the immediate interests of hundreds of 
millions of people. A blunder in urban planning often cannot be 
corrected in a short time, some cannot be corrected at all. 
Leaders and administrators of all types of cities at various 
levels must, out of their sense of responsibility to the state 
and future generations, earnestly sum up experience, constantly 
raise their levels of performance, and tackle the problems in 
urban planning with a positive yet modest approach. 
  A graduation ceremony for the 18th training class for mayors 
was held simultaneously with the book launching ceremony. Chen 
Xitong and Hou Jie spoke at the graduation ceremony.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Jinye (3769 6651 2814)] </F>
  [Text] Jinan, 27 May (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong Yiren 
pointed out during his recent inspection of Shandong: Large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises should treasure the present 
good opportunity for development, work hard to improve their 
operation, pay attention to market demand, do a good job in 
terms of capital funding, material resources, technology, 
qualified personnel, management, and quality and variety of 
products, and truly play a leading role in the national economy. 
  Rong Yiren inspected Shandong and investigated the problems 
of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises there from 19 
to 26 May. During the inspection tour, he was accompanied 
separately by Jiang Chunyun, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Shandong Provincial CPC 
Committee; Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and vice governor of Shandong Province; and Han Xikai, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee. He 
thoroughly familiarized himself with the situation of a dozen or 
so enterprises in seven cities, including the Jinan Light 
Motorcycle General Plant, the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation, 
and the Yantai Beijixing Watch General Plant. He also inspected 
the economic and technological development zones in Yantai and 
Weihai. He fully affirmed the efforts and exploration made by 
Shandong with respect to improving large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, and was satisfied with Shandong's 
achievements in this regard. The present overall situation of 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in Shandong is 
better than last year, though some of them still have 
difficulties. In the first four months of this year, the total 
output value of large and medium-sized enterprises in the 
province rose 15 percent over the same period of last year, 
while their combined total of profit delivery and tax payment 
increased by more than 20 percent. 
  Rong Yiren pointed out: Village and town enterprises have 
developed very rapidly and contributed to rural prosperity and 
stability and to the economy as a whole in recent years. 
Relatively speaking, large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises have been slower in development and suffering many 
difficulties. We should know that if large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises are in poor condition and fail to play a 
leading role in the economy, village and town enterprises will 
be unable to maintain a sustained and healthy development. It 
is understandable that the plant directors or managers of some 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are feeling the 
pressure of difficulties. The promotion of the socialist market 
economy at present is providing large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises with a very good opportunity for 
development. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
have the edge in qualified personnel, technology, and equipment. 
Some successful enterprises among them have set an example. I 
believe that the cadres, workers, and staff members of large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises are full of confidence and 
they will work hard to make progress. 
  Rong Yiren emphatically pointed out: In order to improve 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should take 
the road of reform to establish a modern enterprise system; we 
should carry out coordinated reforms of the hiring, income 
distribution, cadre, and other systems of the enterprises to 
build a good mechanism which conforms to the socialist market 
economy and fully arouses the enthusiasm of cadres and workers 
for production; we should seriously change the mode of operation 
of the planned economy and make great efforts to develop 
marketable products of good quality, great variety, and low cost 
according to market demand, and to eliminate inferior, outmoded 
products promptly; we should establish the notion of large-scale 
cooperation and abandon the practice of making an enterprise 
all-embracing regardless of its size; and while keeping to a 
main line of production, an enterprise should also engage in 
diversified undertakings, and in this way, it will widen its 
market and help resettle the surplus personnel resulting from 
streamlining. Of course, we should not do things beyond our 
reach, otherwise we will accomplish nothing. 
  During the inspection tour, Rong Yiren showed great concern 
about and emphasized the scientific and technological progress 
of enterprises. He said: Large enterprises should have their 
own scientific research institutes, if conditions permit; this 
is the way to accelerate the updating of products, increase the 
scientific and technological contents of products, and enhance 
competitive power in the market. Attention should be paid to 
the training of enterprise workers and staff members so as to 
improve the overall quality of enterprises. Using foreign 
capital and advanced technology, particularly high technology, 
is a good way to transform the large and medium-sized 
enterprises. However, we should deal with reliable foreign 
businessmen and guard against fraud. In the meantime, we must 
not always trail behind others; instead, we should first learn 
from others, and then make our own creations and surpass others. 
He pointed out: We should put our own scientific and 
technological achievements to good use. At present, many of 
them have not been utilized; such a situation affects the 
improvement of the quality of enterprises and their products and 
restricts scientific and technological development. 
  On the circulating-fund shortage reported by some 
enterprises, Rong Yiren pointed out: It is crucial to make 
funds circulate and to distribute them well. Since the 
state-supplied funds are limited, enterprises should mainly rely 
on society and themselves. He said: At present, the circulation 
of funds is too slow in quite a few enterprises. Enterprises 
should pay more attention to careful calculation and strict 
budgeting and to accelerating fund circulation. If they fail in 
this regard, the development of our market economy will be 
affected. The central authorities have already started to 
rectify the debt chain problem among enterprises. He emphasized: 
Enterprises must keep their word in business operations. They 
must not repudiate a debt, nor resort to dishonest practices. 
They must conduct business in an legitimate way and regard 
honesty as the best policy. Only in this way will our socialist 
market economy be vigorous and orderly.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Senior Chinese official 
Li Tieying today awarded the top prize to the film "Phoenix 
Zither" in this year's government film awards. 
  The movie depicts a group of rural teachers who persist in 
opening classes for dozens of poor children in a mountain area. 
The movie has moved audiences to tears in many Chinese cities. 
  Li is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as well as a state 
councillor. 
  The film represents a group of works depicting heroes among 
the common people. This category of arts is likely to go over 
big here and is largely advocated by the government. 
  These works mostly center on humble figures who have the 
same 
life problems as the audience or readers. But they always find 
it a pleasure to assist others, give no thought to personal 
gains or losses, and help others restore confidence in life. 
  Other prize-winning films fall into the categories of 
historical events or ethnic issues, for example, "Chongqing 
Negotiations", which rehashes the historical meeting of Mao 
Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek. 
  Several children's films, documentary films, cartoon films 
and translated films were also given awards. 
  In addition, the film bureau recognized a feature film set 
in 
the securities market and co-produced by the Chinese mainland 
and Hong Kong. 
  The government-controlled contest was first staged in 1957 
but was suspended during the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976) 
when film production came to an almost complete halt. The 
contest was revived in the 1980s. 
  It reflects the government's guidelines on film production. 
In addition to the government film event, there are now two 
other major film contests in China. In the "Golden Rooster 
Awards," top works are selected by movie experts and 
professionals. Prizes in the "One Hundred Flowers Awards" are 
voted on by film audiences.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhaoguo, director 
of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central 
Committee, met here with a delegation from the federation of 
textile-related guilds of Hong Kong this afternoon. 
  The group, consisting of more than 20 members, including 
(Tang Jiqian), (Chen Ruiqiu) and (Fang Keng), arrived in Beijing 
on 24 May. Wang Zhaoguo welcomed the representatives of Hong 
Kong's textile trades. He thanked people of Hong Kong's 
textile-related trades for joining their mainland counterparts 
in working hard for economic development during China's reform 
and opening up period. He also thanked people of Hong Kong's 
industrial and business circles for their work in the 
development of education and public welfare on the mainland. 
  The federation of textile-related trades of Hong Kong, set 
up 
in 1989 and composed of textile, dyeing, garment, and eight 
other guilds, represents Hong Kong's textile and garment 
industries. It is one of the largest industrial organizations 
in Hong Kong. The federation's board of directors is composed 
of well-known industrialists and businessmen of Hong Kong. Most 
of the members of the federation have invested in running 
factories on the mainland. The current visit by the delegation 
is for the purpose of enabling Hong Kong's textile and garment 
industries to increase contacts with the relevant central 
departments, know more about the situation of reform and opening 
up on the mainland, and expand relations and cooperation with 
the mainland. During their stay in Beijing, the members of the 
delegation will pay courtesy calls on the responsible persons of 
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the 
United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the China 
Textile Council, and other departments concerned. 
  Wang Zhaoguo said during the meeting: Over last decade since 
the start of reform and opening up, China has made tremendous 
economic progress, with a rapid increase in investment by people 
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. With the economic and trade 
relations between Hong Kong and the mainland becoming closer and 
closer, Hong Kong and the mainland have been economically linked 
together, complementing each other and working for a common 
prosperity. 
  Wang Zhaoguo exchanged views with the representatives of 
Hong 
Kong's textile and garment industries on questions of concern, 
such as how to work more for Hong Kong's economic prosperity and 
smooth transition.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (CNS) -- According to the State 
Education Commission, universities and colleges in China have 
planned to enroll 895,000 new students this year, a slight drop 
over last year. The commission stressed that the enrollment 
work must be carried out properly and its management 
strengthened. 
  According to an official from the commission, though the 
enrollment scale will drop slightly this year, it does not mean 
that development of higher education in the country would be 
limited nor does it mean that there would be a drop in the 
entrance rate of students enrolled into higher learning 
institutions. Since the number of graduates this year will be 
fewer than that of freshmen, the actual number of students 
studying in universities and colleges will be up to 2.79 
million, an increase of nearly 260,000 or about 10 per cent over 
last year. 
  According to an education development programme drawn up by 
the commission set for the year 2,000, China will see 3.5 
million students studying in such institutions by the year 
2,000, showing an average annual growth of 6.5 per cent. The 
actual growth in the number of students during the past two 
years was higher than the planned figure and so do such growth 
to be seen in this year. [sentence as published] Students who 
will graduate this year are expected at 2.15 million, a drop of 
160,000 while the entrance rate of high school graduates to be 
enrolled into these higher learning institutions will grow by 
1.7 percentage points. 
  The official pointed out that the country had in recent 
years 
seen some violation of state policy on education including 
illegal enrollment of students and running of schools. In order 
to keep the running of these higher learning institutions in 
good order across the country, governments as well as 
departments in charge of student enrollment at various levels 
must strengthen their administration of enrollment plans. The 
commission would make public a number of universities and 
colleges qualified for the enrollment of students on their own. 
Other universities not included in this list can not enroll 
students on their own.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The reminiscences of 
late Hu Qiaomu, who served as Mao Zedong's personal secretary 
from 1941 to 1948, is shortly to be published here. 
  "Hu Qiaomu Recalls Mao Zedong", is being brought out by the 
People's Publishing House. 
  Hu Qiaomu -- who was 29 when he began working as Mao's 
secretary and secretary of the Communist Party's Politburo and 
who went on to become an eminent party theorist and historian -- 
started writing the book in the early 1990s. 
  He died at the age of 81, after an illness, on September 28, 
1992. The writing group which had been helping him to write the 
book then divided its contents into two parts: "The Recorded 
Talks" and "The Initial Drafts," and finished compiling the 
volume. 
  "The Recorded Talks" part includes records of a dozen talks 
by Hu Qiaomu on the subject, while the other part consists of 19 
articles drafted by the writing group along lines requested by 
Hu. 
  These talks and articles cover many important aspects of Mao 
Zedong's thinking and activities in the 1940s.

<F P=106> [By Chris Dobson and Billy Wong Wai-yuk] </F>
  [Text] Yellow Bird, the underground movement responsible 
for helping hundreds of political activists escape from China, 
is still operating -- five years after it was formed in the 
bloody wake of the crackdown on pro-democracy students in 
Tiananmen Square. One of the latest people to be helped by the 
secret organisation is a Shenzhen judge who fled after he 
complained openly about corruption and persecution by the 
judiciary in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ). 
  Mr Zhang, who did not want to give his full name, is the 
first senior judicial figure to cross the border in several 
years. Although he made his own way out of China and is not a 
pro-democracy supporter, Mr Zhang was helped when he first 
crossed the border by the Yellow Bird underground movement. 
Once in Hong Kong he made contact with the same Yellow Bird 
officials who, in 1989, helped Tiananmen Square organisers such 
as Wuerkaixi and Chai Ling flee abroad in the tense weeks after 
the June 4 crackdown. 
  Although the organisation had scaled down its operation, 
officials were still able to put Mr Zhang in a safe house. He 
is now on his way to another country. Yellow Bird is currently 
looking after six activists who are in Hong Kong awaiting asylum 
in a third country. 
  Using a system of mainland sympathisers, who operated at 
great personal risk, the movement managed to slip some of the 
most wanted student leaders out of the country. It has never 
revealed its methods in case further problems in China meant the 
"railroad" would be put into full use again. "After five years, 
I think all Chinese people in Hong Kong are still thinking about 
Tiananmen Square," one of the organisers said. "I think they 
are very concerned about what will happen, because in three 
years we are united." 
  He said the number of dissidents leaving China has dropped 
over the last year, and that many were being encouraged to stay. 
"After five years, many people still want to come out, but we 
advise them to stay . . . we need them inside to bring about a 
new kind of China." Since Yellow Bird was formed, it has helped 
500 dissidents flee from the mainland. And it supports people 
like Mr Zhang, who was wanted in every province for trying to 
expose high level corruption and for escaping from an education 
centre although he had never been convicted of a crime. 
  "I did not intend to link my personal ordeal with politics 
at 
first, but what I experienced during this period made me 
understand the fundamental problem is the system of the 
country," Mr Zhang said. During a seven-month stay in an 
"education centre" on the other side of the Lowu border fence, 
Mr Zhang documented unconvicted "prisoners" making rice noodles 
for export to the United States in filthy conditions. 
  His comments on the abuse of power in the legal system in 
Shenzhen has given the first real insight into an otherwise 
closed part of the society. "China has laws, but no one wants 
to carry them out," Mr Zhang said. "I went to Shenzhen because 
it is an open place with good prospects. My decision was not 
wrong. Shenzhen is a good place, and there are a lot of chances 
but it is the people inside it who are corrupt who disappoint 
me." 
  Mr Zhang's problems began in 1990 when he tried to divorce 
his wife who did not want the separation. He now believes she 
had formed some sort of relationship with a senior court 
official. Soon afterwards, he said, the official "lost face" 
when Mr Zhang saw him and his wife in the official's car outside 
the Shenzhen Middle People's Court. 
  Three days later the official, who Mr Zhang said was a 
powerful man, had him "unlawfully detained" for three days in a 
room at the court building. "Twenty-five days later they held 
me again for three days. They had no right to arrest me and 
were abusing their power," he said. 
  But his real problems began in 1992, after a court clerk 
allegedly found that the senior court official had accepted a 
bribe -- said to have been paid in US dollars--during a 
multi-million fraud trial involving a Shenzhen company. Mr 
Zhang, who was first employed as a judge by Shenzhen city in 
1988 handling mid-level commercial cases, said the manager of 
the company later left China for Singapore. "I then wrote to a 
lot of the upper level judges and to the central authorities, 
including Li Peng, complaining about the case but I never 
received any response," he said. In all, Mr Zhang wrote about 
300 letters over the next two years to senior government 
officials asking for help and seeking an investigation into his 
detention. 
  But in April last year he was grabbed by Public Security 
Bureau (PSB) officers at his house and taken to the Shenzhen 
Labour Education Centre on Shang Bu Bei Road. As soon as he 
arrived he was punched and kicked by five members of staff, a 
beating he believed seriously damaged some internal organs. All 
of his attempts to have an appeal heard went unanswered. 
"Finally a judge from the Guangdong High Court came to see me 
and promised to help," Mr Zhang said. "But then he said I was 
making a lot of trouble between government departments and that 
I had a light sentence at the moment, but if I continued I would 
get a longer one. 
  "On September 1 last year, because I kept writing letters, 
the chief judge and three sub-chief judges came to see me to 
sort out the problem peacefully." They told Mr Zhang if he did 
not agree to sign a "contract" binding him to stop pursuing the 
matter, he would be held in solitary confinement normally 
reserved for violent criminals. 
  When he again refused to comply, he said guards at the 
centre 
started going through his possessions and he found himself given 
harder tasks and told to work longer hours. During his seven 
months at the centre he saw inmates blinded and made deaf by 
beatings. He also witnessed young inmates making rice noodles 
for export to the US in rooms where hygiene conditions were 
"dreadful". 
  Then, last November, he had an accident while working on the 
printing press when one eye was flooded with ink. "The 
authorities allowed me to go out for treatment and when I got to 
the Shenzhen People's Armed Police Hospital, I fled. 
  "The same night I bought a plane ticket to Beijing and went 
to the US Embassy, but I couldn't get in because of the army 
guards outside." 
  He said he kept trying to hand over his evidence but was 
followed, and every time he made a telephone call the line was 
tapped. Earlier this year he slipped into Hong Kong using a 
false name while part of a seven-day tour of the territory.

  [Text] Hong Kong made its decision to demolish Rennie's 
Mill [Village] under pressure from Beijing a senior Taiwan 
official in charge of overseas Chinese affairs alleges. 
  Chang Hsiao-yen, chairman of Taiwan's cabinet-level Overseas 
Chinese Affairs Commission, told a delegation of Hong Kong 
journalists last week that Beijing was behind the government's 
decision to reclaim the village where many Kuomintang soldiers 
have lived since the communists took over the mainland in 1949. 
  He said Taiwan was dissatisfied with compensation made by 
the 
British Hong Kong Government for those forced out of their 
homes. "I believe Beijing has given very heavy pressure to the 
Hong Kong Government," said Mr Chang, a son of former Taiwan 
strongman and president Chiang Ching-kuo and grandson of 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. 
  He said Beijing would not tolerate a sea of Taiwan's 
national 
flags flying on the territory after 1997. However, he said 
Taiwan would not retreat from Hong Kong after 1997 despite its 
reversion to mainland rule. Mr Chiang vowed to continue 
Taiwan's presence. "To think that the government is retreating 
from Hong Kong is absolutely wrong," he said. "Instead, we are 
considering expanding and strengthening our presence and our 
services to our compatriots there but we should make some 
changes in our approach to business." 
  Mr Chiang said the Taiwan Government would not make any 
changes to its policy towards Hong Kong after 1997 and would 
continue its economic, trade, cultural, and educational 
exchanges with the territory. "We will not make changes to any 
of our policies concerning relations with Hong Kong and we will 
spare no effort to continue to assist the territory to maintain 
the present conditions after Beijing's takeover," he said. 
  Mr Chiang said freedom and democracy were two of the most 
important and basic elements that the territory should be 
allowed to preserve, adding that that was the ruling 
Kuomintang's basic policy towards Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong 
affairs would be under the jurisdiction of another cabinet-level 
ministry instead of under Mr Chiang's commission after 1997.

  [Text] Hong kong, May 27 (AFP)--A leading human rights 
monitor rounded on President Bill Clinton on Friday [27 May] for 
renewing China's preferential trade status, lashing it as "one 
more capitulation" that would imperil dozens of activists for 
democracy. The organisation, Human Rights Watch/Asia, scorned 
Clinton's assessment that China had complied with several 
conditions on human rights that he linked to renewal of 
most-favoured-nation status, which gives Chinese goods lucrative 
customs access to the US market. 
  "Far from improving, the overall human rights situation has 
significantly worsened in the year since (Clinton's) executive 
order (on MFN conditions) was issued," the group said in a 
statement issued here. The decision was "one more capitulation 
on human rights," the statement said. 
  "President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on 
China to improve its human rights practices," said Sidney Jones, 
Human Rights Watch/Asia's executive director. "Clinton has left 
his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, while 
the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed, 
uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by 
this decision." 
  Human Rights Watch/Asia -- formerly known as Asia Watch -- 
enjoys a strong reputation as an independent monitor of human 
rights in China. Earlier this month, it released a report 
documenting what it said were the cases of several hundred 
protesters, seized in the crackdown of the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement, who remain behind bars. 
  The statement issued Friday said the leading dissidents, 
workers and religious activists would now be more vulnerable to 
persecution and arrest, given that Chinese leaders "understand 
that a crackdown would not bring about a disruption of trade." 
"Dozens of dissidents had their trials or sentences postponed 
while the Chinese government awaited Washington's decision," it 
said. "Now they can happen with little fear of persecution."

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong economists 
welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's 
most favored nation (MFN) trade status for another year. 
  Xu Yongfu, a senior research fellow in the Hong Kong-Macao 
regional office of the Bank of China, said the decision to renew 
China's MFN trade status and delink human rights from trade 
issues was a pragmatic and wise option. 
  He said that the decision dispelled fears over the Sino-U.S. 
trade development and laid a foundation for the trade growth 
between China and the United States and in the world trade as a 
whole. 
  Edward Leung, chief economist of Hong Kong Trade Development 
Council, said Clinton's announcement to delink human rights from 
trade issues provided a basis for the smooth trade development 
between the two countries and is conducive to China's reentry 
into the GATT. 
  As a large number of Hong Kong manufacturers have opened 
plants in southern China and shipped their products to the 
United States, renewal of China's MFN trade status will make 
owners of these plants at ease and help increase the volume of 
re-export. 
  Benny Chiu, research manager of the China Service Ltd. of 
the 
Hong Hong Bank, said that Clinton's decision will benefit both 
the United States, a major supplier of funds to China, and 
China, a big market for U.S. investors.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation [MFN] 
trading status for another year and to delink human rights from 
trade issues has been warmly received by HK [Hong Kong] 
residents, especially businessmen here. 
  Local business leaders today hailed the decision as not only 
conducive to the trade development among China, the United 
States and Hong Kong, but also conducive to China's reentry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Raymond Ch'ien Kuo-fung, chairman of the Federation of Hong 
Kong Industries, said that the decision will have positive 
impact on the economic development in the three areas, 
especially in Hong Kong. 
  Before the decision was made, some investors had taken a 
wait- and-see attitude towards investment in China, now that 
most of the uncertainties have been cleared away, investors' 
confidence in China will surely be enhanced, which, in turn, 
will benefit Hong Kong, Ch'ien said. 
  Ian A. Christie, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber 
of 
Commerce, believed that the renewal of China's MFN trading 
status has increased the chance for China to reenter the GATT. 
  He hoped China could get its permanent MFN trading status 
from the United States next year, which he said would benefit 
all of the three sides. 
  Henry Tang Ying-yen, vice-president of the Federation of 
Hong 
Kong Industries, expressed his welcome to President Clinton's 
announcement to delink human rights from trade issues while 
deciding to renew China's MFN trading status. 
  He said that the bilateral trade between two countries 
should 
be conducted on an equal basis, and it is never correct for one 
country to threaten the other with unfair trade conditions. 
  Meanwhile, many local public figures have also expressed 
their concerns over the U.S. decision to ban the import of 
Chinese weapons.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The American Chamber 
of Commerce in Hong Kong welcomes President Bill Clinton's 
decision to renew China's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status 
and delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN. 
  "it is critically important to Asia -- the most dynamic and 
vital region on the face of the globe -- that our two countries 
have a relationship that works," the chamber said in a news 
release issued here this evening. 
  It noted that the president's statement of his intention to 
delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN 
signals a firm commitment on the part of the American Government 
to rebuild a "functional, effective and wide-ranging bilateral 
relationship." 
  "The long and bitter debate over MFN is over at last," said 
Gerald Murdock, chairman of the chamber. 
  This is a time for "moderation and optimism," he said, 
adding 
"both the United States and China must seize the moment to build 
new ties, based on broader engagement and dialog."

  [Text] Beijing, 18 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--This 
afternoon, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, met a 
visiting delegation from the five associations of the plastics 
industry of Hong Kong headed by Leung Kei-yau at Ziguangge in 
Zhongnanhai. 
  Zou Jiahua first asked about the current condition of the 
plastics industry, one of the pillars of Hong Kong's 
manufacturing industry and its investment in mainland China. 
  He told the guests that the petrochemical industry had 
become 
an indispensable part of China's economic development, and the 
mainland was also going all out to develop petrochemical and 
related industries in order to meet increasing market demand. 
He also mentioned many times that Hong Kong's plastics industry 
will play a big role in promoting economic cooperation between 
Hong Kong and the mainland and promoting that industry's 
production in the mainland. 
  As requested by the guests, Zou Jiahua gave a detailed 
explanation of the Chinese Government's position and viewpoint 
on the development of Sino-U.S. relations and the 
most-favored-nation status issue. He held an optimistic 
attitude toward the prospect of solving relevant problems and 
expressed confidence in overcoming possible obstacles and 
difficulties. 
  He also answered questions about strengthening macroeconomic 
control and curbing high inflation. 
  Jing Shuping, chairman of the National Federation of 
Industrialists and Businessmen, and Chen Ziying, deputy director 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended the meeting. 
  In addition, tonight, Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and director of the CPC Central 
Committee's United Front Work Department, and Wan Shaofen, 
deputy director of the United Front Work Department, also met 
with the delegation headed by Leung Kei-yau.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
met here today with Peter Chiu, managing director of the Hong 
Kong Health Food Enterprise Company, and his wife Cheung Yeuk 
Lee. 
  Chiu and his wife made the trip to donate six million yuan 
to 
build 100 primary schools in poor regions on the mainland. 
  Li spoke highly of the action and said that people around 
the 
country were paying great attention to education, one of the 
most important and outstanding problems in China now. 
  In recent years, Li said, many patriotic overseas Chinese 
and 
compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao have donated large amounts of 
money to help build schools in poor areas. The donors should be 
praised, he added. 
  He also expressed his hope that relevant departments on the 
mainland cooperate closely with donors and apply their donations 
to yield effective results. For instance, with support of the 
United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee, Taiwan entrepreneur Kander Lee's donation has 
achieved real results in development of education, he said. 
  The 100 schools underwritten by the couple, under 
arrangements by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, are expected to be finished 
by the end of 1995. 
  Part of the donation will be used to construct "Chunlei 
Primary Schools", sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation 
exclusively for girl dropouts.

  [Text] Lu Ping, the director of Beijing's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, last night signalled China's willingness 
to make progress on the much-delayed talks over the building of 
the territory's ninth container terminal and the new airport. 
Lu's remarks indicate a significant gesture by China to improve 
the atmosphere surrounding talks on economic matters. However, 
Lu's seeming desire for progress in talks has in the past been 
followed by serious backtracking. 
  Lu told a Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce delegation in 
Beijing 
that the issue of Container Terminal 9 (CT9) should be 
approached "from the commercial perspective" rather than "mixing 
it up with political factors." Lu said, however, that China 
could not proceed to discussions with the British side before 
the Hong Kong Government had finalised arrangements with 
developers. He said that "economic rules", rather than 
"political trading" should be the guideline for building CT9. 
  Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, last night welcomed Lu's 
remarks. "We accept Lu's comment with delight but the 
government has never mixed the CT9 issue with any political 
factors. The government is now discussing development rights 
with consortia," she said, adding Hong Kong hoped to settle the 
matter as soon as possible as container terminals were very busy. 
  Lu also said Beijing "genuinely wished" to maintain its 
cooperation with Britain in other areas, citing the progress 
made during the latest talks on the financial arrangements for 
the new airport project. Both sides had agreed to discuss the 
Airport Corporation Bill and hoped to reach a general agreement 
on financial arrangements. 
  John Meredith, managing director of Hong Kong International 
Terminals (HIT), has said that construction costs have increased 
by about 20 percent as a result of the lengthy delay. 
  Interested developers include a consortium formed by Modern 
Terminals Ltd (MTL), HIT, the state-owned China Ocean Shipping 
Corporation, and the Jardine Pacific-led Tsing Yi Container 
Terminal group. 
  Turning to other matters, Lu called for an increase in the 
number of meetings of experts from both sides under the Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). He urged the speeding up of work on 
localizing Hong Kong's laws, only some of which could be left 
until after 1997. He invited Hong Kong's "business friends" to 
suggest which laws had to be adapted and approved (by the JLG) 
as soon as possible. 
  On the issue of permanent right of abode for returning Hong 
Kong emigrants, Lu said China welcomed Hong Kong returnees. He 
promised that China would formulate a "lenient policy" and "more 
simple approaches" to enable them to continue to live and work 
in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The value of Hong 
Kong's total exports grew by 8.1 percent in the first four 
months of this year over the same period of last year, the 
Census and Statistics Department announced today. 
  Among the total, the value of re-exports rose by 13 percent, 
while that of domestic exports fell by 7.8 percent, according to 
external trade figures released by the department. 
  Supported largely by the continued expansion in Hong Kong's 
re- export trade, the value of imports showed an increase of 9.5 
percent. 
  These led to a visible trade deficit of 24.4 billion H.K. 
dollars (3.13 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months, 
equivalent to 6.8 percent of the value of imports during the 
period. 
  This compared with a deficit of 18.4 billion H.K. dollars 
(2.34 billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 5.6 percent of the 
value of imports, recorded in the same period of last year. 
  Commenting on the trade figures, a government spokesman said 
that the performance of re-exports was still quite robust, 
although the growth rate had moderated somewhat from last year. 
  The spokesman attributed the moderation mainly to slower 
growth in re-exports to the Chinese mainland, the United States 
and Germany.

  [Text] Macao, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The continuity of China's 
most favoured nation (MFN) trading status was not only 
beneficial to China's economic and trade development, but also 
good for Macao's economy. 
  Maria Gabriela dos Remedios Cesar, director of the Macao 
Government's economic department, was quoted by local newspapers 
as saying that the continuity of China's MFN status was a good 
news for businessmen and also was favourable for steady 
development of Sino- U.S. trade relations. 
  In another development, chairman of the Macao Export and 
Import Association Victor Ng said it was a sensible act of the 
U.S. Government to continue China's MFN status, for it is good 
for economic development of both sides. 
  He also said that it was a good thing that the U.S. 
Government has ever done to separate human rights from MFN 
issue. However, he added, it is hard to understand that the 
U.S. Government use munitions as a condition for continuity of 
China's MFN status.

  [Text] Liu Huaqing, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
Standing Committee member and Central Military Commission vice 
chairman, inspected Hubei Province 17-20 May. 
  During his inspection tour, Liu Huaqing visited the Wuchang 
Shipyard, where he inquired about production and met and held 
talks with cadres and workers; visited Wuhan's Changfei Optical 
Fiber Cable Company Ltd. and the Donghu High and New Technology 
Development Zone; visited Yichang, where he inspected the Three 
Gorges Project on Zhongbao Island; and visited the Gezhouba 
Power Plant, where he was briefed on the plant's construction 
and management. 
  During his stay in Wuhan, Liu Huaqing met with locally 
stationed military and armed police commanders. During his 
inspection of Hubei, Liu Huaqing energetically called for 
building a national defense industry characterized by high and 
new technologies, speeding up the national defense modernization 
drive, making the national defense industry submit to and serve 
the central task of economic construction, and contributing more 
to national economic growth. 
  Liu Huaqing stated: The old generation of revolutionaries 
have all along been very concerned about the national defense 
industry. They have not only offered brilliant expositions on 
national defense development but have also personally supervised 
a large number of key defense-related scientific research 
projects. As a result, China has now joined the ranks of the 
scientifically and technologically developed countries. Over 
the past few years, under the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission, China's defense-related scientific and technological 
undertakings have registered faster growth. In the years to 
come, we should continue to carry out more arduous work, 
constantly forge ahead, continually make explorations, and 
strive to live up to each and every ardent expectation placed on 
us by the old generation of revolutionaries in this connection. 
  Liu Huaqing pointed out: Having been tempered and trained 
over the past several decades, China's defense-related 
scientific and technical personnel and managerial personnel have 
now become a professional contingent capable of doing hard work, 
offering selfless devotion, and making more contributions to 
China's national defense cause. With this highly competent and 
commendable contingent, China's national defense modernization 
drive definitely stands a very good chance of success. 
  Liu Huaqing maintained: China's national defense industry 
should strive to keep abreast with the current rapid high and 
new technological development, should organically combine 
domestic scientific research achievements with advanced foreign 
technology and equipment, should continually improve and upgrade 
defense-related technology and equipment, and should more 
efficiently implement the strategic principle of active defense. 
In the years ahead, in order to ensure systematization, 
integration, and reliability, we should set higher technological 
requirements on and new goals for the country's defense-related 
scientific research, should vigorously improve scientific 
research management and quality, should avoid formalism and 
fraud in scientific research, and should conscientiously and 
meticulously conduct scientific research. 
  Liu Huaqing emphatically noted: Now that the whole country 
is giving top priority to and taking economic construction as 
the central task, the country's national defense industry should 
unswervingly submit to and serve the overall interests of 
economic construction and should actively support industrial and 
national economic development in local areas. 
  Accompanying Comrade Liu Huaqing during his inspection of 
Hubei were Xie Guang, vice minister of the Commission of 
Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense; Wang 
Shen, deputy commander of the Guangzhou Military Region; Hubei 
Governor Jia Zhijie; Hui Liangyu, Hubei Provincial CPC Committee 
deputy secretary and Hubei Provincial Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference Committee chairman; Qian Yunlu, Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee deputy secretary and Wuhan City CPC 
Committee secretary; Xu Shiqiao, Hubei Provincial Military 
District political commissar; among others.

<F P=106> [By reporters Jia Yong (6328 3057) and Ma Xiaochun (7456 </F>
2556 2504)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- Since China's current 
military service law was promulgated 10 years ago, people across 
the country have fulfilled their obligation according to the law 
and have actively supported and participated in national defense 
building, ensuring the smooth development of national defense 
work and socialist modernization. 
  Tan Dongsheng, director of the Mobilization Department of 
the 
General Staff Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
told reporters that, since the current military service law, 
which was approved by the Second Session of the Sixth National 
People's Congress [NPC] was promulgated on 31 May 1984, 
servicemen and people across the country, under the leadership 
of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the 
Central Military Commission, have worked diligently to enforce 
the law and have achieved noticeable results. 
  -- A good trend has been formed in which everyone has shown 
concern for and supported national defense work. The state has 
listed the study of the military service law as an important 
part of the efforts to popularize legal knowledge. All 
localities -- in light of their local realities, especially 
their annual conscription work -- have regularly publicized the 
law and applied themselves to enforcing it, enabling the masses 
to be more national defense-minded. Party committees and 
governments at all levels and all social sectors have endeavored 
to do a good job related to military service and militia and 
reserve service, and a good job in giving special care to and 
making job placement for disabled servicemen and to family 
members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen. Moreover, many 
provinces and cities have established and promulgated relevant 
regional laws and regulations. 
  -- The vast numbers of military service-age youths have 
enthusiastically enlisted themselves for military service, 
providing large numbers of high-quality soldiers to the troops. 
During each year's conscription season, people in both urban 
and rural areas across the country scrambled to enlist 
themselves for military service. The number of newly enlisted 
young people with college or special secondary school 
educational level has been on the increase year by year. 
  -- The large numbers of militiamen and reserve service 
personnel have actively participated in military training and 
endeavored to perform their duty to stay combat-ready, making 
themselves the PLA's right hand and a powerful reserve force. 
They have played an important role in building bridges, 
constructing roads, developing mines, harnessing rivers, 
building water conservancy projects, reclaiming lands for 
farming use, afforesting lands, taking the lead in studying and 
applying sciences, tackling key quality problems, and helping 
the poor to improve their lot. 
  -- Work in supporting the army and giving preferential 
treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs has 
been strengthened and has developed in the new situation. 
"Regarding the troops as the great wall and servicemen as one's 
family members" has been truly practiced among the people. In 
particular, since Comrade Deng Xiaoping wrote the inscription 
for the "Model Double-Support City" in early 1991, the country's 
double-support work has been raised to a new level and large 
numbers of model double-support cities (counties) and advanced 
double-support individuals have emerged. 
  -- Importance has been attached to giving preferential 
treatment to active duty servicemen and to job placement for 
demobilized and retired servicemen. The State Council has held 
annual meetings on job placement services for demobilized 
military cadres and party committees, and governments at all 
levels have regarded the work as a political task, enabling 
demobilized military cadres to be properly resettled. The 
"Regulations on Resettling Retired Compulsory Servicemen" -- 
promulgated in 1987 by the State Council -- have assured 
employment for compulsory servicemen retiring from active duty. 
Governments at all levels have given various preferential 
treatments to active duty servicemen and their families, and 
this has played an important role in raising the servicemen's 
social status and in helping them perform their military duty 
free without worries. 
  -- Military training for college and secondary school 
students has been widely conducted. As demanded by the military 
service law and the "Outline for China's Educational Reform and 
Development," which was jointly issued by the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, as of this date, 1.04 million 
college students and 620,000 secondary school students have 
received military training.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- A television film "The 
Great Wall Is in My Heart" -- a joint production of the 
Mobilization Department of the General Staff Headquarters and 
the Mass Work Department of the General Political Department -- 
whose title was inscribed by Jiang Zemin, has been completed. 
The eight-part defense education series will soon be 
distributed to people's armed forces departments across the 
nation. 
  "The Great Wall Is in My Heart" is China's first 
comprehensive and systematic educational TV film on national 
defense. Guided by the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought and based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on 
army building in the new period, the series employs a large 
amount of stirring historical data and illustrative facts in 
presenting a vivid picture of how the three generations of CPC 
leadership collectives care about and value defense buildup. 
The series, which gives publicity to the series of principles 
and policies for China's national defense buildup; the 
achievements scored in this regard; and national defense laws 
and regulations including the "Military Service Law"; and 
disseminates modern defense knowledge, is visual teaching 
material on defense education for the broad mass of militiamen, 
reservists, and youngsters.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned from the 27 May press briefing 
jointly sponsored by the Commission on Politics and Law and the 
propaganda department of the provincial CPC committee that Anhui 
has scored marked interim progress in its crackdown on crime 
over the past month. The number of criminal cases has dropped 
significantly throughout Anhui, and the increase in major crimes 
was halted. The crackdown is now developing both in breadth and 
depth. 
  After the provincial CPC committee and government announced 
the crackdown in a telephone conference on 25 April, the 
provincial judicial and public security departments and the 
prefectures and cities took immediate action by instituting a 
system of leadership responsibility and setting up crackdown 
offices. Principal leaders took upon themselves the 
responsibility of implementing the crackdown. Pursuant with the 
provincial plan and in light of their respective public security 
conditions, the various prefectures and cities set the tasks, 
objectives, target areas, and prime targets of the crackdown 
and formulated general requirements and methods and steps for 
implementing the crackdown. Moreover, they also utilized mass 
media and other propaganda tools to build up the momentum and 
offered support in terms of financial and material resources. 
  As of 25 May, the province had cracked over 5,000 criminal 
cases, of which 1,400 were major ones. A total of 875 criminals 
gangs were crushed and 4,100 gang members were pacified. Over 
12,000 criminal offenders of every description were arrested, of 
which 1,500 were escaped criminals and convicts. Stolen money 
or goods worth 15 million yuan and over 1,000 firearms were 
seized. 
  At present, the prefectures and cities have entered the 
phase 
of punishing and processing the criminals. Public security, 
procuratorial, and court departments are working together to 
exploit the victory and to ensure that the crackdown will be a 
success.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Fuzhou, China, May 30 (AFP)--Southeast China is 
booming, and nowhere more than in Fujian where the government is 
straining to keep the economy on a leash. Austerity is a taboo 
word in wealthy Fujian, which posted a 25 percent growth rate in 
1993, double the national average and displeasing to the central 
government. The two economic engines in the coastal region, the 
capital Fuzhou and the special economic zone of Xiamen, have 
forecast respective growth rates of 17 and 27 percent in the 
face of futile government calls to limit growth to 9 percent. 
  "This rhythm suits perfectly the needs of our city," said 
Xiamen deputy mayor Zhu Yayan, who is in charge of economic 
matters. 
  For most of the province, planning called for a modest and 
politcally acceptable 11 percent growth. "The forecasts are in 
general on the low side. We didn't foresee such a rapid rise 
for last year," said Wang Dexian of the Fujian planning 
commission. 
  And when Wang and other provincial officials reel off the 
impressive list of projects in store for Fujian in 1994 and 
subsequent years in the fields of construction, transport, 
energy and telecommunications, it is difficult to imagine growth 
coming back into single digits soon. The province's cities seem 
to work 24 hours a day, and factory after factory appears in the 
countryside. 
  "Public investment will undoubtedly be less important this 
year than last, but it's difficult to pinpoint an amount," said 
Wang Wengui from the communist party in Fuzhou, a city in which 
growth topped 33 percent last year, among the highest in the 
country. 
  The most difficult task facing authorities here is to 
control 
expansion in the private sector, which is playing an 
increasingly important role in increasing the wealth of Fujian 
residents. Joint ventures now account for over half the 
province's industrial production, and have left state stores 
back in the stone age of Chinese commerce. 
  The frenzied pace of economic development has authorities 
deeply worried not only about inflation, but of the lapse in 
social order that uncontrolled inflation could spark. But the 
authorities know that official attempts to dampen down the 
economy could anger traders and the public alike. The public is 
already fed up with power cuts that regularly hit stores, 
restaurants and Xiamen's increasingly popular video games rooms. 
  "We must satisfy the population," Zhu said in the face of an 
inflation rate of over 20 percent for the first part of 1994. 
  "Our sincere wish is to avoid consumer panic like in 1988, 
and we have already taken macroeconomic control measures," said 
Zhen Longyang of Xiamen's economic commission. "For certain 
essential goods such as pork and several types of vegetables we 
have established ceiling prices, and have started stockpiling 
grain, oil and cotton," she said. 
  "Our politics are summed up in three words: Reform, 
development, and stability," Zhu said, refusing to enter into 
the debate curently taken up in Beijing about the importance of 
stability in relation to the other two goals. And if it is 
suggested to him that Fujian's rapid growth will only widen the 
chasm between China's rich and poor areas and so affect the 
country's stability, Zhu answers: "Deng Xiaoping has fully 
explained that some have to get rich before others."

  [Text] The province's public security organs have cracked 
a exceptionally serious fraudulent case of running joint 
ventures by cheating and using the signboard of Sino-foreign 
joint ventures to forge the certificates of foreign exchange 
funds and to defraud customers of their money by more than 100 
million yuan. Zheng Chen, and 14 other criminals have already 
been arrested and brought to justice. 
  On 6 July last year, the Pingyi County Public Security 
Bureau 
seized five unlawful elements for illegally purchasing old bills 
of U.S. dollars in the county's (Hongshi) Town. And 4.5 million 
yuan in Renminbi, seven cars, and eight wireless mobile 
telephone sets were captured on the spot. According to 
preliminary investigations, they were an exceptionally serious 
criminal gang engaged in fraudulence. This case has drawn the 
attention of the provincial party committee, the provincial 
government, and the Ministry of Public Security. The provincial 
public security department has directly commanded the 
investigation of this case and organized the public security 
organs of related prefectures and cities to conduct 
investigation in all directions. Through a lot of investigation 
work, it has been ascertained that Zheng Chen, principal 
offender, had been sentenced to three and half years of 
imprisonment in Beijing on the charge of embezzlement and 
bribe-taking. In April 1992, criminal Zheng, in collusion with 
his partners, fled to Shandong and got acquainted with a foreign 
trader through all sorts of relations. Under the condition of 
paying $50,000 or 500,000 yuan in Renmenbi to this foreign 
trader every year, Zheng used the name of this foreign trader to 
run some false joint ventures in Weifang and Taian one after 
another. Zheng Chen himself served as president and general 
manager of these joint ventures. Then, by using the signboard 
of Sino-foreign joint venture, and by using the mentality of 
urgently needing foreign exchange among large and medium-sized 
enterprises, Zheng Chen forged the certificates of foreign 
exchange funds and signed many contracts on exchanging U.S. 
dollars in the name of supplying goods. Whenever he gained a 
certain amount of money by cheating, he wrote new certificates 
of funds from banks to lure even more customers to be deceived. 
In addition, by using the difference of time, he adopted the 
method of drawing in a large amount of money and paying a small 
amount of money and the method of tearing down the east wall to 
repair the west wall to occupy a huge amount of funds for 
operation and circulation. He also spent money without 
restraint. It has been ascertained that this criminal gang 
defrauded some 106 million yuan from more than 40 enterprises in 
Hebei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shandong, and seven other 
provinces and municipalities. 
  In the course of handling this case by public security 
organs, in order to reduce the economic losses of the deceived 
units and support enterprises to develop production, the 
captured 60 million yuan of illicit money and property have 
already been returned to the deceived units. At present, this 
case is still under further investigation and handling.

  [Text] According to the figures released by the provincial 
meeting on employment held on 28 May, last year 771,000 persons 
in the province registered with proper units for seeking jobs. 
Of them, 473,000 persons obtained employment through the 
introduction by employment service centers, 186,000 persons were 
placed in urban areas, and more than 70 percent of them were 
employed through the two-way choice between the employing units 
and employees. This shows that the province has basically 
defined the dominant position of market-oriented employment. 
  Since the beginning of last year, labor departments at all 
levels in the province have further emancipated the mind, 
renewed ideas, and continuously expanded the employment sphere 
based on the characteristics of market-oriented employment, thus 
making the province's employment work witness a new situation of 
reform and development. The old employment concept that existed 
for scores of years has begun to be broken, and new employment 
ideas and modes have occupied a dominant position. Instead of 
squeezing in state-owned units, urban job-seekers have vied with 
each other in working for nonstate-owned sector of the economy, 
such as urban collective enterprises, foreign-invested 
enterprises of three types, and township and town enterprises. 
Along with the changes in the people's employment ideas, 
flexible employment forms have also begun to emerge. In the 
past, once a person was employed, he obtained a life-long job. 
And most workers were long-term fixed workers, and the form of 
employment was unitary. At present, the province is 
experiencing the coexistence of diverse and flexible employment 
forms, such as contract workers, temporary workers, seasonal 
workers, odd-job workers, and hour-based workers. The 
employment pattern of separating urban areas from rural areas 
has also been broken. Instead of mainly employing urban 
job-seekers, the province has begun to employ job-seekers in 
both urban and rural areas. According to the unified arrangement 
of the state, the province has conducted [words indistinct] for 
employment of rural people and has begun to manage in a unified 
manner the transfer and flow of the 10 million surplus laborers 
in rural areas. Some economically developed cities have begun 
to carry out unified arrangements for urban and rural laborers. 
In addition, export of laborers has developed further. Last 
year, the province exported some 2 million workers abroad, and 
the situation of making unified arrangements for employment in 
urban and rural areas also began to emerge in this regard.

  [Text] Jinan, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Shandong, one of China's 
major bread baskets, is expected to reap another record harvest 
for its summer crops this year, provincial officials announced 
here today. 
  According to a recent survey and remote sensing by 
meteorological satellite, the east China province is expected to 
produce 20 billion kg of wheat, a little more than last year. 
  Wheat production accounts for half of Shandong's annual 
grain 
harvest. The province sowed 4.4 million hectares of wheat this 
year, a little less than last year. But total output can be 
better as per unit production can reach 5,805 kg per hectare, up 
by 240 kg over last year. 
  Local officials attributed the growth of summer crop output 
to improved field management, favorable weather conditions and 
intensified efforts in technological extension services, as 
high- quality seeds were provided for 95 percent of the sown 
areas.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ji Hongkeng (6060 3126 6342); from the special </F>
column: "China's March Toward Economic Efficiency"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- In the past, people 
used to say Shanghai people were astute but somewhat unwise. It 
is different now. We can get some idea of this by viewing 
Shanghai's use of foreign capital. 
  The strategic policy known as "one head, three centers" 
(aimed at building Shanghai into one of the world's economic, 
banking, and trade centers by relying on the development of the 
Pudong New District as the head or driving force) is bringing 
about earth- shaking changes in Shanghai. The Shanghai people 
have stood up, they have widened their horizon, and naturally 
they have demonstrated their skills and become much wiser. 
<H5>  "Optimization" and "Stressing Eugenics" </H5>
  On the matter of utilizing foreign capital, whether to 
recklessly go after quotas and quantity and to integrate 
"quantity" with "quality" or to pay more attention to quality -- 
this is a problem that has not been satisfactorily solved until 
now. The practice of seeking quick results, rushing headlong 
into mass action, and never rejecting offers is very common 
today. As a result, "what has been picked up and placed into 
the basket" was not necessarily a "vegetable." 
  What is astute and wise about Shanghai is that its people 
pay 
attention to efficiency. The rate of success in forming joint 
ventures was high, and the economic results were good. Among 
the nearly 4,000 foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai, more 
than 80 percent are making profits. Last year, their exports 
were worth $1.61 billion, accounting for 22 percent of the 
municipality's total export volume. Last year, the (Hezhong 
Kaili) Air Conditioning Equipment Company's per-capita profit 
(after tax) was 50 yuan, making it an outstanding enterprise. 
The joint venture partner is the transnational (Kaili) 
Corporation of the United States, which has been known as "the 
father of central air conditioning." Its American deputy 
director boasted that the joint venture is the most successful 
enterprise the corporation has invested. 
  The Shanghai Caohejing New Technology Development Zone has 
paid attention to the size of investment projects. More than 
120 foreign-funded enterprises have been established in this 
zone, with the rate of success reaching 95 percent. It has 
developed into an industrial park with microelectronics as the 
forerunner, followed by industries employing new technologies, 
such as computers, optical fiber communications, biological 
engineering, new materials, electronic parts and elements, 
industrial automation instruments and meters, and the space and 
aviation industry. A large number of well-known transnational 
corporations have established plants in the zone, and 16 of them 
were investment projects with more than $10 million each. Last 
year, 82 foreign-funded enterprises went into production. Their 
per-capita income was 340,000 yuan; per-capita tax and profit, 
77,000 yuan; and per-capita foreign exchange earnings, 26,500 
yuan. In this zone, the Shanghai (Fukesibolo) Company, a 
Sino-U.S. joint venture, manufactures industrial "brains" -- 
instruments, meters, and systems for controlling and managing 
industrial processes. Its automation control systems have been 
used by the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant. The company made 
profits in its second year after going into production, with 
profits surging to a peak in 1991. Between 1991-1993, the 
foreign joint venture partner made more than $4 million. A boss 
of the foreign joint venture's mother company said jokingly, 
when he met general manager Wang Zhenfeng in Singapore: "Hey, 
we are millionaires!" 
  In Shanghai, veteran experts said that selecting the correct 
investment project is very important, adding, to select the 
right investment project, it is better to have less than too 
many. In using foreign capital, it is necessary to pay 
attention to "optimization" and "eugenics." This is because if 
a problem occurs in the fetus of the mother, economic efficiency 
is out of the question. They said: Foreign businessmen have 
come to make money, but we have to choose the moneymaker who 
will benefit China. This is called mutual benefit. 
  To accept offers uncritically is not wise. A responsible 
person of the State Council Special Economic Zone Affairs Office 
in charge of foreign investments said: In using foreign 
capital, we should take the initiative and avoid being passive. 
We should not accept all offers. Instead, we should strive for 
projects that we need. 
  Many economically efficient joint ventures in Shanghai 
constantly import advanced technologies; some even set such a 
condition in the joint venture contracts. This is a wise policy. 
  A one-time deal with respect to importing technology is not 
to our advantage, let alone importing what is abandoned by 
others. Modern science and technology are subject to fast 
updating. To make our enterprises economically efficient and 
win in competition, we must not overlook the dynamic import of 
technology. 
  What do we mean by dynamic import? It means that the 
imported technology should be like a river with constantly 
running water: After an imported project is put into operation, 
it continues to receive updated versions of the technology from 
its foreign provider. In this way, the product will be 
maintained at an advanced technological level and have 
competitive power in the international market for a long time. 
  The automatic control system at Shanghai's Baoshan Iron and 
Steel Corporation is a new product just developed in the United 
States and supplied by a Sino-American joint venture in Shanghai 
-- the (Foxboro) Company. How could the company obtain the 
product so fast? It is because the company has a constant 
supply of the latest American technologies. According to the 
company, to import a product dynamically is like eating, and you 
should chew one in your mouth, hold another in your hand, and 
set eyes on a third; otherwise, the imported product will be 
unpopular and even lose its market. 
  The Sino-German Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation [SVWC] 
imported the technology for the Santana sedan. According to the 
contract, the German partner is obligated to help the 
corporation develop new car models. With the constant increase 
in the proportion of parts produced by our country, for the 
first time, our sedan industry has the ability to follow 
advanced foreign technology and to develop new car models. Now, 
SVWC has begun to develop a new model. So far, the SVWC has 
produced more than 200,000 sedans which sell very well. It 
plans to produce 200,000 cars this year. When the new model is 
developed, SVWC will become even stronger. 
  The strong win and the weak fail. Old products and 
technology inevitably have no competitive market power. When 
using foreign capital, and particularly when using it in running 
high-technology industries, it is necessary to regard dynamic 
import as an important part of the cooperation. 
<H5>  Enlightenment From the Investment by Transnational Companies </H5>
  The comrades in Shanghai told me that 27 of the world's top 
100 transnational industrial companies have come to invest in 
Shanghai, and others are discussing investment projects with us. 
In the New Pudong District, 30 joint ventures, cooperative 
enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises have 
investment from transnational companies. Large transnational 
companies, with combined functions of investment, trading, and 
banking, is the major form of modern production in the present 
world. They have more and more become the principal part of the 
world's economic activities. In cooperation with them, we can 
benefit from their large-scale and systematic operation. 
  The United Nations has rated the Shanghai Bell Telephone 
Equipment Manufacturing Company, a famous Sino-Belgian joint 
venture, as one of the top 10 best joint ventures for the fourth 
consecutive time. All its 1994 products have been pre-sold. 
(Mauriel), an old member of the board of directors on the 
Belgian side, arrived in Shanghai in April; it was his 100th 
visit to China. Well-known in Belgium for being a representative 
of the Sino-Belgian joint venture "Shanghai Bell" founded 11 
years ago, he is frequently invited to give lectures here and 
there, and he takes pride in his role. Since "Shanghai Bell" 
tided over some difficulties in the initial stage, its major 
product, the Sino-Belgian digital program-controlled telephone 
exchange system (of the world's technological level of the late 
eighties), has been selected by the state as an exceptional 
piece of equipment and rated a universal product up to (ARCAT) 
[a er ka te 7093 1422 0595 3676] international standards. The 
product can compete with its counterparts produced by other 
companies in the world in terms of both quality and price. 
Shanghai Bell's products account for more than one third of all 
program-controlled telephone exchanges currently used in China, 
and the users of the company's products are all over China. 
Shanghai Bell has exported complete sets of hardware and 
software. It is buying land in Pudong for the construction of a 
larger and technologically more advanced production base. 
  It is very necessary to attract more powerful consortiums 
and 
transnational companies to cooperate with us. It is because 
they are capable of working on high-technology, new-technology, 
and large-scale projects, as well as capital-, technology-, and 
knowledge-intensive projects. They are more dependable in terms 
of capital funds and they can play a remarkable demonstration 
role. Of Shanghai's economically efficient large and medium 
backbone enterprises, the top five with the highest per-worker 
profit earnings are enterprises funded with transnational 
investment. Cooperation with transnational companies meets our 
needs in terms of substitutes for imports, industrial policy, 
and industrial structure. Transnational companies invest in a 
wide range of areas, including banking, trading, guesthouses, 
real estate, and infrastructure. One bird can attract 100 more 
birds; so, a large transnational company's investment usually 
inspires other relevant companies and trades to invest in China. 
Transnational companies are law-abiding, more trustworthy in 
contract fulfillment, and work according to international 
practices. 
  Our use of foreign capital is progressing from lower to 
higher levels, and from the labor-intensive stage to the 
technology- and knowledge-intensive stage. So far, China has 
approved the establishment of over 180,000 joint ventures, 
cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises. 
The absolute figures show that only a small number are large 
projects, but the large projects involve a large sum of 
investment. In Shanghai, there are 472 enterprises each funded 
with an investment of over $10 million. They account for only 6 
percent of the total number of foreign-funded enterprises, but 
their investment accounts for 65 percent of the total 
investment. In addition, all of them are advanced-type 
enterprises. 
  In the use of foreign capital during the initial stage of 
opening up, we paid more attention to importing single items. 
With the change in the situation, we need more systematic 
imports because a system's force is greater than the combined 
total of several single items. According to a Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Ministry International Economic Cooperation 
Institute researcher, who is well-versed in transnational 
companies, the characteristics of transnational companies are 
systematic operation and investment by combining industry with 
science and trade and by involving more than one industry and 
one trade. Transnational investments have enlightened us. 
  Calculating "Grade Differences" 
  Some say we should not be content with using foreign capital 
on small-scale projects, while others call for concrete analyses 
to replace the "sparrow warfare" and "guerrilla warfare" 
tactics. For regions that have made some headway in inducing 
foreign capital, it is correct not to rest content with 
small-scale foreign-funded projects. However, as regions have 
developed unevenly, most transnational corporations have 
invested in major coastal cities and other regions with better 
infrastructure. For a greater number of regions, should they 
carry out small, medium, or large foreign- funded projects? 
Even major cities do not use foreign capital entirely on large 
projects. Therefore, we should not neglect the use of foreign 
capital on small and medium projects, which should be carried 
out selectively and on the condition of mutual benefit. Foreign 
capital must not be induced to our disadvantage and, much more, 
to the detriment of our spiritual civilization. 
  As far as foreign capital use is concerned, the issue of 
phased transfer and technological "grade differences" merits our 
thought. Special economic zones and major cities are golden 
regions, where we should concentrate on high-grade projects in 
line with the investment trend and conducive to the readjustment 
of production structure; primary and labor-intensive and 
semifinished products manufacturing projects should be 
transferred to other regions. We should do some economic 
calculations of the "grade differences." 
  Shanghai Bell Vice President Li Dalai remarked: "We do not 
want to promote small and comprehensive projects, but will 
concentrate on software. Some domestic enterprises have their 
machine tools lying idle. We intend to reinvigorate them by 
moving them to other regions. We may even set up some research 
institutes in the hinterland, with headquarters in the coastal 
region and the same wages and living conditions as those of the 
coastal region. The environment there [the hinterland] is peace 
and quiet and good for doing research." His remarks reflect the 
demand for the coastal region to move out to and bring along the 
hinterland as well as for foreign-funded enterprises to raise 
their rate of domestic production. 
  It is time for special economic zones and some major coastal 
cities to transfer step-by-step labor-intensive enterprises to 
other regions and to increase the value of golden regions 
themselves by increasing contacts with leading and transnational 
corporations having high-grade technologies and substantial 
strength. 
  China vis-a-vis the world and vice versa shows that the 
changing global economic structure has provided us with many 
development opportunities. We should adopt a strategic vision 
and improve the work of using foreign capital with astute and 
wise thought.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 28 (XINHUA) -- A Sino-Japanese 
supermarket was launched here today, the first Sino-foreign 
joint venture of its kind set up in Shanghai. 
  The store, a joint venture between Japan's noted retail 
company Yaohan, and the Shanghai Liannong Inc., cost 300,000 
U.S. dollars and sells foodstuffs, clothes and other daily 
consumer goods, some being imported from Japan, company 
officials said. 
  Feng Guoqin, vice-secretary-general of the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government, said the supermarket demonstrated that overseas 
businesses will be allowed a share in developing local chain 
supermarkets. 
  An official from Yaohan said today that the company has set 
up a China department to supervise its development in China. 
  The Yaohan-Lian Co. plans to set up five more chain 
supermarkets in Shanghai in two years, sources said.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 30 (XINHUA) -- A hundred thousand 
callers per day dial 168 for Shanghai's telephone information 
service -- and most of the callers want information about 
banking or sex. 
  The round-the-clock service is about to celebrate its first 
birthday -- and a survey has shown which section is most 
consulted by the public. 
  The service was set up in June last year by the municipal 
telecommunications bureau. 
  When a caller dials 168, he or she hear a recording listing 
the numbers for the available subjects. A second call will 
provide recorded information on that topic. 
  The list includes general knowledge on psychology, sex, 
family, banking, foreign exchange, stocks and shares, mainland 
entry and exit formalities, and a special service for foreigners. 
  "Most of the daily 100,000 calls were for banking 
information 
and general knowledge about sex," said Chen Qiang, deputy head 
of the center said. 
  "This indicates the rise of Shanghai people's sense of 
banking and investment. Nowadays, more and more people who are 
embarrassed to ask for sex general knowledge face to face with 
the experts like to make a phone call," he said. 
  Chen said that Shanghai was the third city after Nanhai 
city, 
Guangdong Province, and Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, to 
open such a phone service, which has been praised by residents, 
the municipal government and experts.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The new Shanghai 
University, merging four previous universities in the city, was 
officially launched today. 
  The four forming the new university are the Shanghai 
Polytechnical University, Shanghai University of Science and 
Technology, Shanghai Science and Technology School and the 
original Shanghai University. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin personally calligraphed the 
new 
university's name-board. 
  Qian Weichang, noted Chinese scientist and vice-chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, was made the first president of the 
university. 
  Speaking at today's ceremony, Qian said that graduates of 
the 
new university should be patriots, people of high morality and 
noble hearts first of all, and then people of knowledge. 
  The new university will combine schools of science, 
technology, literature, arts, law, business and management in 
one. It will have 7,700 teachers and support staff, and close 
to 17,000 students, the largest among higher education 
establishments in Shanghai, said university officials. 
  The new university will have eight campuses totalling nearly 
100 ha., and college buildings totalling 610,000 sq.m. in floor 
space, the officials added.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] New York has the Statue of Liberty, Paris has the 
Eiffel Tower, now Shanghai will have its own imposing monument 
to symbolise China in the 21st century. 
  When the statue, tentatively called "China Colossus", is 
finished around the year 2000, it will be 118 metres high, twice 
the size of its New York counterpart, according to Xie Lin, of 
the city's statues commission. 
  But comparisons with the Liberty Island lady, which ran 
rampant in the Shanghai press after the decision was made this 
week, were not being encouraged. "In terms of meaning, ours 
will be completely different from the Statue of Liberty," Xie 
said. 
  "The China Colossus will be a profound symbol of the Chinese 
nation, symbolising the reform and opening policies of our 
powerful country at the onset of a new century." Like its New 
York counterpart, it would be likely to be a woman, but other 
human representations could also be considered, Xie said. 
  An exact replica, as was erected by students in Tiananmen 
Square five years ago, was "impossible", Xie said. 
  Xie said arguments were still raging about cost-sharing 
between the central and local governments and some political 
questions concerning the design. "Experts from the central 
government have many ideas. This is not something we can decide 
in a flash," he said. 
  Xie said it might be premature for him to even talk about 
the 
choice of Shanghai, a decision made while Beijing's statues 
group was in the city this week. "I can't disclose which 
departments in the central government are in charge. But they 
feel this matter is not ready for public announcement," he said. 
  But he could not restrain his enthusiasm over the city's 
success in winning the statue. Guangdong province had been the 
front runner when the central government first began secret 
discussions about erecting a "symbol of rising China" last 
November. 
  "We will have to draw on all the experience of thousands of 
Chinese sculptors around the world for this solemn task," he 
said. Nor could the city's press refrain from a little chest 
thumping after the supposedly secret conclave on the statue left 
town this week. 
  "Standing aloft in Shanghai will soon be a statue of 118 
metres, twice as high as America's Statue of Liberty," the 
Shanghai Labour Daily said. Beijing leaders are understood to 
be angry at the reporting of the statue in Shanghai before the 
official New China News Agency (Xinhua) was informed. 
  "Beijing will have the final say on what the statue looks 
like and where it stands, not Shanghai," one Shanghai official 
said. 
  Present plans call for the statue to be built up-river of 
Shanghai proper along the Huangpu River, the official said. 
This would avoid any charge that the statue was incompatible 
with the traditional architecture of the Bund. 
  It would also ensure that China's newest symbol is not 
diminished by the 450-metre Oriental Pearl television tower, 
which is already halfway to the skies across the river in the 
Pudong new area.

  [Text] Foreign espionage remains a threat to Guangzhou's 
political and social stability as well as the overall safety of 
China according to Guangzhou leaders. 
  "Activities by foreign spies in China aimed at subversion, 
infiltration, divisiveness and rebellion have not stopped," the 
Guangzhou party secretary, Gao Siren, told a recent state 
security meeting, the official GUANGZHOU DAILY reported on 
Sunday. "Foreign enemy forces have joined hands to encourage 
destructiveness, which is a danger to the social stability of 
Guangzhou," he said. 
  The mayor of Guangzhou, Li Ziliu, said many people were 
lulled into a "one-sided" belief that economic prosperity meant 
"not being conscious about secrecy and the movements of the 
enemy." 
  The warnings follow a special trip to the Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone in April by the director of the State Bureau of 
Secrecy, Shen Hongying, who said those regions on "the front 
line of China's opening to the outside world" caused the 
greatest loss of state secrets. "The frequent foreign economic 
exchanges of Shenzhen... have led to arduous and complicated 
secrecy needs," Shen said. 
  Chinese leaders have expressed alarm at the frequency of 
contacts between foreigners and Guangdong officials, which they 
believe has resulted in disclosure of state secrets. 
  Officials from other parts of China frequently travel to 
Shenzhen or Guangzhou to meet foreign couterparts for the sake 
of convenience. 
  China's concept of enemy spies is not limited to 
trenchcoated 
diplomats poking around military bases. It includes everyone 
from foreign businessmen gathering conventional market data to 
journalists doing what in most countries would be considered 
their regular work of news reporting. 
  Shen's and Gao's use of the term jingwai (outside the 
border) 
rather than waiguo (foreign country) in reference to espionage 
activities that are supposed to be aimed against China reflects 
their belief that Hong Kong and Taiwan people are possibly the 
biggest threat to them. 
  While political secrets remain closely guarded, economic 
reform has made it almost impossible for any significant 
economic policy or information to be kept secret for long, 
despite the best efforts of the secrecy cadres assigned to every 
department of both central and local governments. 
  Gao said stepped up vigilance in guarding state secrets in 
Guangzhou was crucial for both government cadres as well as the 
common people. 
  Li dismissed suggestions that stepped up vigilance in 
protecting economic, technological, and commercial secrets would 
harm Guangdong's economy. "All such thoughts are badly 
mistaken," the mayor said, without further explanation.

  [Text] Workers in a Hong Kong owned factory have won 
higher pay rises after they went on strike protesting against 
12-hour working days and wages below the minimum set by labour 
regulations. 
  The three-day strike went ahead as official trade unionists 
campaigned for better protection for employees of foreign 
investors. 
  They said reports were increasing of industrial accidents 
caused by mismanagement and maltreatment of Chinese workers by 
overseas enterprises. 
  The workers, more than half of about 4,000 employed in a 
computer disk factory in Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, went on 
strike 10 days ago. Last April, they were offered a 13 per cent 
pay rise, well below the inflation rate in the city. They said 
that, in defiance of local labour regulations which set a 
minimum rate of 325 yuan (HK$289) a month for the average 
worker, and a maximum eight-hour day, the company had made them 
work 12 hours every day for an average take-home monthly pay of 
about 300 yuan. They said that despite the extra hours, they 
had received no over-time pay nor had they been given free 
accommodation, a condition most foreign-funded enterprises were 
obliged to provide. 
  The dispute was resolved when the employer, with the 
mediation of government officials, agreed to meet the workers' 
demands. 
  An official of the Zhuhai foreign investment management 
centre said some foreign funded enterprises imposed harsh 
regulations on workers, defying labour laws. A labour mediating 
centre was set up last year in Zhuhai to handle disputes at 
joint-ventures enterprises in the zone. 
  Official unionists say joint ventures were caught up in more 
than 100 strikes in the past year. In 90 per cent of such 
cases, the workplace did not have a union or was only partly 
unionised. They said a long-awaited labour law giving greater 
protection for workers was under deliberation and was expected 
to be put forward this year. 
  The vice-president of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions, Li Qisheng, said Chinese law stipulates that workers 
enjoy collective bargaining power so that, represented by 
official trade unions, they could participate in the formulation 
of worker-related company rules. However, international labour 
unionists say Chinese workers often have difficulties 
safeguarding their rights. 
  Although the federation claimed to represent most workers, 
many had quit or given up on it because it failed to offer 
practical assistance. 
  The Chinese Government has outlawed unofficial labour 
unions.

  [Text] While carrying out investigations and studies in 
Guilin Prefecture, regional party Secretary Zhao Fulin pointed 
out: Proceeding from the practical conditions in our region, we 
must treat the efforts to increase grain output and make money 
to ensure a good crop and the wealth of our people as a guiding 
principle for agricultural development. Meanwhile, it is 
necessary for us to take practical measures to conscientiously 
work for increasing grain output in a steady way, and for 
continuously enhancing peasants' incomes to maintain a 
sustained, comprehensive and coordinated rural economic 
development. 
  On 15-19 May, Zhao Fulin successively conducted 
investigations and studies in Guanyang, Pingle, Yongfu, and 
Lingchuan Counties of Guilin Prefecture. He went to the fields, 
visited peasant households, forest farms and orchards, and went 
deep into large specialized households in farming and breeding 
and township and town enterprises to find out about the 
situation of agricultural production and township and town 
enterprises. Guilin Prefecture has been increasing its grain 
output for years running. Last year, on the basis of greatly 
adjusting its farm production structure, per capita consumption 
of grain by peasants in the prefecture was 446 kg. Its 
diversified economy and township and town enterprises have been 
developing considerably. Zhao Fulin affirmed the achievements 
of Guilin Prefecture. Wherever he went, he discussed with 
county, township, town, and village cadres and the masses the 
way to correctly handle relations between increasing grain 
output in a stable way, developing diversified economy, and 
expanding township and town enterprises, as well as measures for 
speeding up development. 
  Zhao Fulin pointed out: Handling well the above-mentioned 
relations is an inherent need of the development of agriculture, 
and the correct path for promoting a benign agricultural cycle 
and sustained, comprehensive and coordinated development of our 
rural economy. It is also needed by our efforts to guide 
peasants to become rich and advance toward small-scale 
prosperity, and to preserve social stability. With regard to 
the way to increase grain output and make more money to ensure a 
good crop and people's prosperity, Zhao Fulin stressed that the 
following work must be done effectively: 
  We must first enhance and unify our ideological 
understanding. Zhao Fulin stressed: Only by developing grain 
production can we stabilize the livelihood of our urban and 
rural residents. Only thus can rural areas develop forestry and 
fruit undertakings, animal husbandry, aquatic production, and 
other undertakings which rely on meat and grain. In the 
meantime, only by developing diversified economy and township 
and town enterprises can we increase peasants' incomes and 
gradually improve their living standard and quality. Only thus 
can we arouse peasants' enthusiasm in farming and producing 
grain. 
  Zhao Fulin continued: Judging from our region's conditions 
for agricultural production, it is a unified matter to increase 
grain output and develop diversified economy, because they help 
each other. Therefore, grasping a stable increase in grain 
output will not affect the development of diversified economy. 
It is not necessary to base the development of diversified 
economy on a reduction in the acreage under grain or in grain 
output. Increasing grain output does not conflict with making 
money. Leading cadres at all levels must unify them well in 
both understanding and practice. While grasping the stable 
growth of grain output, they must also vigorously develop 
diversified economy to achieve comprehensive agricultural 
development, and ensure that we reap a good crop and that our 
people are wealthy. It is necessary for us to take practical 
and effective measures to ensure a stable increase in our grain 
output. 
  Zhao Fulin added: Agriculture is the foundation of our 
national economy, while grain is the core of this foundation. 
We must never waver in this basic idea at any time or under any 
circumstances. To ensure a stable growth in our grain output, 
an important thing for us to do is that we must conscientiously 
implement the policies of the central authorities, and the 
preferential policies for grain production in particular. We 
must establish and perfect our grain storage system, and pursue 
a grain purchase protective price. Even in a bumper harvest 
year, we must not delay in purchasing grain, and never issue 
IOU's. We must ensure that peasants are not adversely affected 
by great increases in grain output so as to arouse and protect 
their enthusiasm in producing grain. In the meantime, we must 
rely on science and technology to increase yield per unit area, 
and multiple cropping to raise the total output of grain. It is 
necessary to vigorously develop diversified economy and township 
and town enterprises to further boost peasants' incomes. 
  Zhao Fulin emphasized: Under the prerequisite of steadily 
increasing grain output, we must persist in sticking to the 
principle which is beneficial to giving play to our strong 
points, conforming to market demand, and attaching importance to 
efficiency to greatly develop diversified economy. Various 
localities must suit measures to local conditions to greatly 
adjust rural production setups, develop their strong points and 
avoid their weaknesses, and make use of their own favorable 
conditions. Marketability and efficiency determine what they 
plant, breed, exploit, process, and develop. 
  Zhao Fulin pointed out: In light of the practical 
conditions in our region, we can mainly develop our diversified 
economy in the following ways: 
  1. Making use of hills and waters. This means we can develop 
forestry, orchards, and breeding undertakings on hills and 
mountains, and the aquatic products industry in waters. To 
become rich, we must plant more trees. In the future, our 
region must not only increase the acreage under fruit trees, but 
also attach importance to transforming low-yield orchards. In 
particular, we must pay attention to developing famous, special, 
excellent and rare fruits to enhance our economic efficiency. 
There are vast grasslands in our region, and we have huge 
markets because of being close to Guangdong, Hainan, Hong Kong 
and Macao. We have good conditions for developing animal 
husbandry. We can raise large quantities of pigs, cows, 
chickens, ducks, milch cows and so on. We must stabilize the 
acreage under sugar cane. Some localities must make use of dry 
land to expand the acreage under sugar cane to meet the pressing 
capacity of the existing sugar refineries. There are pools, 
reservoirs and fish ponds in our region, and the area for 
fresh-water fishery has reached nearly 2 million mu. A 
considerable part of this fresh-water fishery area has not yet 
been utilized. It is necessary for us to develop fresh-water 
fishery. In the meantime, we must fully utilize the sea in our 
region to speed up the pace of developing our sea fishery. We 
must work hard for several years to ensure that total output 
value of aquatic products in the coastal counties and cities 
will exceed or be equal to the output value of their planting 
and breeding undertaking on land. It is necessary for us to 
create several additional cities and counties relying on sea 
resources. 
  2. Making use of winter agriculture: Our region has a 
temperate winter climate. It is beneficial to making use of 
winter idle farmland to develop the winter farming and breeding 
undertaking. In the future, the areas of winter agriculture 
must be increased year by year. We must strive to eliminate 
winter idle farmland in two or three years. 
  3. Making use of city suburbs. Rural areas in city suburbs 
must be developed around the needs of cities, and grasp well 
vegetable basket projects by developing vegetables, pig-raising, 
fishery, chickens, ducks, eggs, milk, and so on. This will not 
only ensure sufficient market supplies in cities, but also 
increase the income of peasants in city suburbs. 
  4. Making use of science and technology. We must devote our 
main efforts to producing high-quality vegetables, fine-breed 
pigs, precious fish, and rare birds and animals to significantly 
increase the economic efficiency of our farming and breeding 
undertaking. 
  Zhao Fulin stressed: It is necessary for us to vigorously 
develop township and town enterprises. Due to the fact that our 
region was late in starting its township and town enterprises, 
we must now attach importance to developing undertakings related 
to resources. We must stick to the principle of the 
simultaneous movement of wheels, and multitrack advance. While 
attaching importance to developing rural collective economy, we 
must also pay attention to the development of individual and 
private economy. We must deepen rural reform to promote 
simultaneous development of grain and diversified economy with 
emphasis on promoting the shareholding system and the 
shareholding cooperative system. We must exercise land use 
rights in a flexible manner. Through the rural shareholding 
system, we must speed up and optimize the composition of the 
elements of production, including land, work force, funds and 
technology. We must speed up rural water conservancy works 
projects, and improve conditions for agricultural production. 
This will provide a guarantee for the stable growth of grain 
and the development of diversified economy. On the basis of 
improving the contract responsibility system on a household 
basis with remuneration linked to output, we must exercise land 
use rights in a flexible manner. We must mainly allow peasants 
to use land as their share in joining rural shareholding 
cooperative economic organizations. In some localities, land 
transfer with compensation such as leasing should be allowed. 
With regard to barren hills, hillside fields, waters, and sand, 
other forms of transfer should also be allowed. 
  Zhao Fulin continued: Through promoting the shareholding 
system and the shareholding cooperative system, we must 
establish and improve our service system and speed up our 
comprehensive agricultural development. In the meantime, we 
must gradually realize specialization in our agricultural 
production, unification in operation, the combination of 
industry and agriculture, large- scale operation, and mutual 
supplementation of the strong points of grain and diversified 
economy aimed at common development.

  [Text] Nanning, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region utilized foreign funds of 120 
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter this year, up 56 
percent over the same period in 1993. 
  According to Lei Aizu, official in charge of opening 
affairs, 
overseas money has now turned to industry, agriculture and 
infrastructures from real estate and tourism, which were hot 
spots in recent years. 
  Industrial and farming projects accounted for 69 percent of 
the 239 foreign-funded enterprises newly approved in the last 
quarter. 
  Ten of them have been invested with over 10 million U.S. 
dollars each. 
  Lei said that 80 percent of the newly-approved projects are 
funded by investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  He also noted that foreign investors have started to expand 
their businesses into the mountainous areas. 
  At the beginning of this year, a special committee led by 
the 
region's top officials was set up to promote investment from 
abroad. 
  The region's growth of foreign investment in 1993 topped the 
list among the provinces in China's coastal areas.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Four Chinese and 
foreign companies have won the bid for three major parts of the 
World Bank financed Xiaolangdi water control dam construction 
project on the middle reaches of the Yellow River. 
  The Inpergilo company of Italy, the No. 14 Water Conservancy 
and Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau of China, and Dumiz Company 
of France and the No. 6 Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric 
Engineering Bureau of China, which are selected among more than 
30 Chinese and foreign companies, have been given the jobs of 
building the dam, culverts and spillways, and facilities for 
generating electricity. 
  They have formed two international joint management groups 
to 
achieve best effect and will soon start work on the construction 
site. 
  Xiaolangdi water control dam is among the first of its kind 
in China to select builders through international bidding and 
the practice is in accordance with requirements of the World 
Bank. 
  Earlier reports also showed that the Xiaolangdi water 
control 
project, situated 40 km north of Luoyang city, Henan Province, 
has won a loan of 570 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank. 
  As a project to introduce World Bank loans, the Xiaolangdi 
water control dam has received the assessment of 15 delegations 
sent by the World Bank since 1988. 
  Through concerted efforts from Chinese and foreign experts, 
the Xiaolangdi Dam is believed to have basically met the 
requirements for appraisal from the World Bank in aspects such 
as engineering technology, dam safety, relocation of people, 
budgetary estimates of projects, economic and financial 
analysis, consultancy of supervised management in construction, 
training program of technical workers, and the drafting of the 
tender documents. 
  Preparatory work for the Xiaolangdi water control project, 
which was initiated in September 1991, has been completed ahead 
of schedule after two years' efforts from 15,000 builders. 
  The preparatory work has cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 
137 million U.S. dollars). It includes facilities for 
transport, water and electricity supplies, telecommunications 
and facilities to house the construction workers, according to 
earlier reports. 
  The relocation of the first 10,000 local residents in the 
construction area -- mainly in Jiyuan and Mengjin Counties of 
central China's Henan Province -- has also come to an end, with 
full support from local governments and farmers concerned. At 
the same time, the Ministry of Water Resources has also 
established a department in charge of construction and a 
department responsible for supervised management in accordance 
with international common practices, as well as management 
information system of projects. 
  More than 300 supervisory engineers have been brought in 
from 
across the country to attend training courses where lectures are 
given by World Bank officials. 
  When completed, the Xiaolangdi water control project will be 
the largest conservancy works on the Yellow River and will be 
China's second biggest after the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang 
Jiang. It will play an important role in diverting the Yellow 
River flow, preventing floods, generating power and controlling 
sediment, according to experts. 
  The experts say that the entire project, which will take 11 
years to finish, together with other reservoirs nearby, will 
enable the lower reaches of the Yellow River to absorb a flood 
of a magnitude that occurs only once in one thousand years.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
financed resettlement project has proved to be a stunning 
success as the first group of more than 10,000 residents have 
moved to a new settlement area to make way for a large scaled 
water control project at Xiaolangdi on the middle reaches of the 
Yellow River. 
  The 570 million U.S. dollar resettlement project should be 
held up as an example to follow in future resettlement, said a 
World Bank official, after an on-the-spot investigation of the 
resettlement area. 
  The first group of resettlers have moved into 12 new 
villages 
where water and electricity supply is available. 
  "We used to live in cave dwellings," a local peasant Tu told 
the World Bank official. "Now the conditions are much better. 
[no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Persisting in the principle of resettlement through 
development, the local government has built houses totaling 
220,000 square meters and created a dozen hectares of new land. 
The 12 new villages are accessible by roads. In addition, more 
than 800 local peasants have been given jobs in more than 30 old 
and new industrial enterprises. 
  The 300 households from the Xiaolangdi village of Mengjin 
County, Henan Province, have moved into new detachment houses 
[as received]. The village has also built a primary school and 
a kindergarten. Last year the village invested three million 
yuan in a new steel rolling mill which may produce 40-million 
yuan worth of products a year. 
  Located 40 km north of Luoyang city, in central China's 
Henan 
Province, the Xiaolangdi water control project, China's second 
largest after the Three Gorges Dam on the middle reaches of the 
Chang Jiang, will play an important role in diverting the Yellow 
River, handling floods, generating power and controlling 
sediment, according to experts. 
  The project will displace 180,000 rural people of 190 
villages in eight counties of Henan and Shanxi Provinces. 
  In addition, five million sq. m. [square meters] of houses 
and cave dwellings, and seats of 11 township governments, 250 
factories and enterprises will have to be moved. 
  The officials in charge of resettlement of Xiaolangdi water 
control project said the relocation of residents from the 
construction area completed so far was only a very small part of 
the entire resettlement work for Xiaolangdi Dam, and greater 
efforts should be made to relocate the remaining 170,000 rural 
population from the dam area. 
  According to the resettlement plan, 154,000 more rural 
residents will have to be relocated by the turn of this century, 
while the remaining 17,000 will be relocated during the second 
phase during 2010-2011 period. 
  The local officials added that supervised management system 
will be introduced in resettlement work of Xiaolangdi water 
control dam, which means that specially-assigned engineers will 
carry out an overall supervised management on relocation of 
resettlers, and social and economic appraisal organizations are 
also supposed to give an objective and fair assessment of the 
resettlement, in a bid to protect the legitimate rights of 
resettlers.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 28 (XINHUA) -- There is a rush among many 
people to join the private economy in central China's province 
of Hubei. 
  More and more people from government departments, colleges, 
institutions and state-run enterprises are "plunging into the 
sea of business", as the Chinese expression for joining the 
private economy goes. 
  By the end of March this year the number of private 
enterprises and individually-run firms had reached 95,173, 
employing 196,800 people. They have produced a total value of 
1.83 billion yuan so far, a 43 percent increase over the same 
period of last year. 
  The Wuhan city government has taken the economic growth in 
private sector as an important part of the reform in recent 
years. To make it work better, the government has drawn up a 
series of regulations and policies, urging government 
departments at all levels to turn on the green light for the 
registration, land use, personnel recruitment and money raising 
of private and individual enterprises. 
  Now, most of the new private businesses can get their 
licences within two or three days. 
  The development of the private economy not only provides 
jobs 
for both surplus staff of government departments and the 
unemployed, but also makes a great contribution to the 
development of the whole local economy.

  [Text] Changsha, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Regulations on 
protection of minors, implemented as early as 1988, has produced 
positive results in central China's Hunan Province. 
  The province has carried out the law thoroughly, 
coordinating 
parents, schools and citizens, three main elements in educating 
and protecting people under the age of 18, to work for the 
healthy growth of minors. 
  More than 3,400 counselling centers have been opened, at 
which parents can realize their obligations and responsibilities 
for their children and be given information on juvenile 
psychology and physiology. 
  The province has extended a warm hand to its 91,000 school 
dropouts, mostly in poverty-stricken mountain areas. 
  Backed by more than six million yuan raised through various 
channels, over 30,000 dropouts have returned to school in three 
years. And eight "hope" primary schools have been set up. 
  Some 96.7 percent of children of school age have sat in 
classrooms. 
  The province has spared no efforts to enrich the cultural 
life of minors and crack down on pornography. 
  Its juvenile and children's library, whose name was 
personally calligraphed by Communist Party General Secretary and 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, has a collection of 500,000 
books, and last year had two million juvenile readers. 
  In 1993, more than 100 books by the two publishing houses 
which target adolescents gained awards at or above provincial 
level. 
  Moreover, orphans and disabled children have received 
medical 
care from the provincial civil affairs departments and hospitals. 
  In Xiangxi (western Hunan) Autonomous Prefecture, 1,100 
children who contracted cataracts and 377 young polio patients 
have been relieved of their suffering.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chaowen (1728 6389 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Jointly sponsored by 
the State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, and the Ministry of Power Industry [MPI], a national 
work conference on rural electrification, which opened in 
Beijing today, declared that China will, within this century, 
supply electricity to all its counties, provide electricity to 
more than 120 million farmers living in remote and 
poverty-stricken areas, and raise to over 95 percent farmers' 
households with access to electricity. 
  On behalf of the State Council, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua told 
the conference that there are three essential requirements in 
bringing about rural electrification: policy implementation, 
self-reliance, and vigorous utilization of rich local 
resources. He said that the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council have always been deeply concerned about agriculture, 
rural areas, and farmers. They are also deeply concerned about 
the process of rural electrification. He urged electricity and 
other departments and sectors to cooperate with each other; 
enlist the support of local governments and people; redouble 
their efforts in implementing the project of using electricity 
supplies to alleviate poverty; help the broad masses overcome 
poverty and achieve prosperity; and make new, solid 
contributions to a thriving rural economy. 
  It has been learned that China's rural electrification 
process, which started in the 1960's, has achieved remarkable 
progress since China started implementing the policy of reform 
and opening up. By the end of 1993, electricity consumption at 
the county and lower levels reached 249 billion kwh, or 35 
percent of the nation's total; 97 percent of townships, 93 
percent of villages, and 89 percent of farmers' households had 
been provided with electricity, showing an increase of 5.2, 
14.9, and 23.7 percent, respectively, over the 1980 levels. Per 
capita annual electricity consumption for the rural population 
reached 48 kwh in 1993, 7.9 times the figure for 1978. 
Nationwide, 144 counties have accomplished rural electrification 
while plans for rudimentary electrification through the 
development of hydroelectric power stations are being carried 
out smoothly in 200 counties. Power stations are being built in 
the countryside nationwide at different levels and through 
multiple channels. A structure of rural power sources that 
include electricity supplies from the major power grids, small 
hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations, and wind and solar 
energy is beginning to take shape. 
  However, due to the restraints of a multitude of historical 
and economic factors and natural conditions, there are still 28 
counties, 1,269 towns, and 54,860 villages that have virtually 
no electricity supply. About 120 million farmers in 
poverty-stricken areas in a dozen provinces and autonomous 
regions, mostly in central and western China, are waiting to get 
electricity. These areas, often sparsely populated and 
economically undeveloped, are the most difficult to electrify 
because they are far from major power grids, and the local 
finances are tight. 
  At the conference, the MPI put forward the "Program for 
Electrifying China's Countryside in the 1990's." Among its 
primary targets are supplying electricity to all counties by the 
year 2000 so that most of the poverty-stricken villages and over 
95 percent of farmers' households will have electricity. It 
also calls for building 1,000 counties with electricity across 
the country. These targets have been incorporated as key parts 
of the State Council's plan for helping 80 million people 
overcome poverty in the next seven years. 
  It has been learned that the MPI's "project of alleviating 
poverty and bringing about common prosperity through the supply 
of electricity" has received vigorous support from local 
governments. The Shandong Provincial Power Bureau, for example, 
has announced a six-point preferential policy. The Inner 
Mongolian Autonomous Region worked out a plan of providing power 
supplies to all villages. Shaanxi Province has announced a plan 
of electrifying impoverished areas in three steps. The meeting 
urged local governments and national departments in charge of 
planning, economics, electricity, and poverty alleviation to 
work as one and make contributions to providing electricity to 
farmers' households across the nation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese leader Li 
Ruihuan said here today that long-term interests and the 
environment should be emphasized in city construction. 
  Addressing the gathering for the first publication of the 
book "Wan Li's talks on city construction", Li, member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, said faults are likely to 
emerge with the fast growth of the economy and the speeding up 
of city construction. 
  The book, made up of 48 talks on city construction by 
China's 
former Minister of Construction Wan Li, was praised by Li as a 
"summary of lessons and experiences of China's 40 years of city 
construction." 
  Li cited the publication of the book as "a great event", 
saying that all leaders in charge of city construction should 
read it in earnest. 
  He said that there are some leaders who know little about 
city construction and never listen to other's criticisms with an 
open mind. 
  He pointed out that in some cities, many high buildings are 
arranged inappropriately, too much outside decoration is used on 
high buildings, the colors of some buildings are not in harmony, 
and the green areas are scrappy and scattered. 
  "Some faults in city construction can not be redressed until 
long after the fact, if ever," Li warned. 
  He called on city leaders and managers summing up historical 
experience and prudently handling various issues in city 
construction. 
  China had more than 570 cities by 1993, with 32 extra-large 
cities each with a population of over one million, 36 big cities 
each with a population of 500,000 to one million, 161 
middle-sized cities with 200,000 to 500,000 people, and 341 
small cities with a population of no more than 200,000.

  [Text] Hefei, 26 May (XINHUA) -- An on-the-spot meeting 
sponsored by the State Council Environmental Protection 
Committee on reviewing the law enforcement of environmental 
protection in the Huai He basin concluded in Bangbu, Anhui, 
today. During the meeting, a plan for controlling water 
pollution in the Huai He basin was adopted, ushering in a 
massive effort to control pollution there. 
  State Councillor Song Jian, who is also in charge of the 
State Council Environmental Protection Committee, said that it 
is necessary to take economic, administrative, and legal 
measures to control the Huai He's pollution within a set time so 
as to achieve the goal of making the Huai He clean by the end of 
this century. 
  During the meeting, leaders from four riparian provinces 
along the Huai He --Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong -- as 
well as responsible people of relevant state ministries and 
commissions adopted a plan for pollution control in the Huai He 
basin after carefully analyzing the river's pollution and 
control situation. To control Huai He pollution, the following 
efforts will be made: The State Council Environmental 
Protection Committee and the Water Resources Ministry will take 
the lead in forming a Huai He water quality control 
organization, with the participation of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, 
and Shandong and relevant State Council departments. The 
organization will be responsible for coordinating and planning 
the overall control of the Huai He's pollution. A Huai He water 
quality pollution control monitoring network will be established 
and improved to conduct dynamic monitoring of the river's 
mainstream and all major tributaries and carry out a target and 
comprehensive control of pollution in all of its sections. A 
group of enterprises along the Huai He whose pollution is severe 
and hard to control will be closed down, suspended, merged with 
other enterprises, or their product lines changed in three 
years. The first batch of enterprises whose pollution is severe 
and whose economic performance is poor will be closed down, 
suspended, merged with other enterprises, or product lines 
changed this year. In addition, 200 control projects will be 
accomplished in three years. By 2000, all riparian cities and 
counties along the river must build water pollution treatment 
facilities suitable to local conditions. It is necessary to 
formulate relevant laws and regulations concerning the control 
of the Huai He's pollution to put the control work on a legal 
track. The meeting urged the four riparian provinces to carry 
out and accomplish the control plan included in the "Eighth 
Five-Year program." Any construction projects that might cause 
severe pollution will be banned in the future. 
  State Councillor Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai 
He's pollution, it is necessary to have a resolute attitude and 
action and carry out the work in a planned and systematic way. 
In this way, we can achieve practical results. We will never 
leave the polluted Huai He to the next century. Riparian local 
governments at all levels should conscientiously strengthen 
their leadership and supervision and inspection. They must 
carry out the water pollution control plan. They must clearly 
define their responsibility and achieve their goals within the 
set time. Any units that are slack in carrying out pollution 
control measures or shift their responsibility onto others and 
cause bad consequences will be criticized in circulars. If a 
case is serious, their leaders shall be investigated and affixed 
the responsibility for it. 
  Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai He's pollution, it 
is necessary to adhere to the principle that "polluters are 
responsible for cleaning up." Through the cleaning-up process, 
it is imperative to help cadres and people living along the Huai 
He foster a sense of importance to protect the environment. We 
should establish a new norm of social behavior that is 
beneficial to the environmental protection. The drive to 
control the Huai He's pollution is China's first attempt to 
clean up the whole basin of a river that flows through several 
provinces. This will be a giant project involving a wide 
stretch of areas and many people. Under the leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, we should mobilize 
leaders at all levels and the broad masses of the people to 
actively participate in the work. We should launch a joint 
effort to control pollution in the Huai He. We must make the 
Huai He clean again in this century and provide experiences and 
methods for the drive to clean up other transregional rivers in 
China.

  [Text] Haikou, 17 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The annual 
meeting of the Society for Research on Restructuring Economic 
System was held today at the China Reform and Development 
Research Institute in Haikou. Well-known economist Gao 
Shangquan, the institute's president, talked about the society's 
five major research topics for the future as he reviewed the 
actual conditions of the development of economic reform. 
  --The way to properly handle the relations among reform, 
development, and stability. This is a problem which is very 
complicated and covers an extensive area. Correct decisions 
will be made only after systematic study by various quarters, 
careful comparisons, and the consideration of advantages and 
disadvantages. 
  --The way to expedite the reform of state-owned enterprises 
and the establishment of a modern enterprise system. This is a 
weak link in China's economic reform, as well as a problem which 
must be earnestly solved as reform enters the current stage. 
  --The way to further develop and cultivate the market 
system, 
especially sensitive markets, such as the securities market, the 
property rights market, the futures market, and the real estate 
market. Not only are there different concepts and 
understandings, but there is also a certain degree of risk, and, 
if this work is not done properly, the system can become a venue 
where some people engage in purely speculative activities. 
Therefore, it is necessary to carry out thorough research on 
how to unswervingly, healthily, and systematically develop the 
market economy. 
  --The way to properly carry out reform of the wage and 
social 
insurance systems. Reform in this area involves the immediate 
interests of millions of people and has a great degree of 
difficulty and risk; therefore, it is necessary to adopt active 
and prudent principles, win popular understanding and a 
consensus, then promote them step by step in a planned manner. 
  --The way to promote the smooth implementation of the 
macroeconomic reform measures that have been announced for this 
year and to achieve the transformation of government functions 
as soon as possible. 
  The Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System 
has 
been in existence for 11 years. The members of the executive 
committee of the society include a large number of experienced 
economists and officials in charge of economic matters. The 
current annual meeting in Haikou, the first meeting of the third 
executive committee of the society, will elect a new group of 
executive committee members. 
  Li Tieying and Wang Shiyuan, minister and vice minister 
respectively of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy; 
An Shiwen, president of the Society for Research on 
Restructuring Economic System, and Zhou Taihe and Tong Dalin, 
the two vice presidents of the society; Hainan Governor Ruan 
Chongwu and Hainan Deputy Party Secretary Du Qinglin, attended 
the meeting along with approximately 180 experts and officials.

  [Article by Tong Zhiguang (0157 1807 1639): "My Opinion of 
Strategy for Foreign Trade Development in 1990's"] 
  [Text] Conglomeraton is one of the major characteristics in 
the present international situation of economic relations and 
trade. The process of "integration" of the world economy will be 
a long-term one, but we can clearly see that competition in 
international commodity market is increasingly fierce, and that 
the situation for superior commodities to win out and inferior 
ones to be eliminated through competition is extremely clear. 
This is one of the important characteristics after the Cold 
War. High-quality and inexpensive commodities carry all before 
them, and low quality, high cost, low technological content, and 
low added-value commodities gradually retreat from the market. 
This is an inevitable outcome of the function of objective 
economic laws that admit of no sentiment. Any people or country 
that wants to occupy a place in the market full of fierce 
competition, especially those who want to occupy a larger share, 
must realize, understand, and control such a law. From an 
economic point of view, such a law is objective and impartial. 
This is the genuine force behind international market 
competition--comparative advantage. 
  Out of consideration of "being prepared for danger in times 
of peace", theoretical and academic circles are now discussing 
the strategy for foreign trade development in the 1990's. No 
doubt this is extremely far-sighted. The author believes that 
only by studying this question at several levels can we draw a 
correct conclusion. 
<H5>  I. Study Practical Problems by Integrating Theory With </H5>
Practice 
  We must first see clearly that foreign trade has entered a 
new stage either in the world or in China. The characteristics 
of the new stage are: Machinery and electronics products are 
highly technological, and consumer goods are high-grade. 
Intellectual property, visible, invisible, and service trades 
are all included in the large context of foreign trade. Foreign 
trade in its original sense can no longer cover the current 
foreign trade activities. The sphere of study of foreign trade 
has obviously been enlarged, and relations between various forms 
of foreign trade have become one of the focal points of study. 
  Second is the integration of foreign economic relations with 
foreign trade. It is very difficult to separate so-called pure 
foreign economic relations from pure foreign trade. Under many 
circumstances, foreign trade export is no longer the material 
export of commodities. It may possibly be invisible export of 
funds, technology, and labor, that is to say, production centers 
have been moved to sales markets. China's attraction to foreign 
investments lies in the huge sales market. 
  China's foreign economic and technological assistance is of 
such a nature, but it is a pity that it has never been 
consciously linked with foreign trade, or they have even been 
seriously separated. The state encourages, through policies, 
close integration of the two, which is a big step forward under 
reform. We can already feel the economic performance brought 
about by such integration. 
  Third is foreign trade legislation and policy guidance. When 
we have the above basic understanding, it does not mean that 
foreign trade work will certainly succeed. We must have a whole 
set of legislation for standardization and a whole set of 
policies for guidance, encouragement, or restraint. Here in the 
first place is the basic legislation adopted by the National 
People's Congress--the "Foreign Trade Law" and related laws 
enacted on anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The second 
line is industrial policies, and country and regional policies. 
  The most important goal of foreign trade legislation, of 
course, is to standardize the operational behavior of foreign 
trade operators, so that foreign trade will develop healthily 
according to legal regulations. Foreign trade legislation is 
also an important means for ensuring and safeguarding China's 
interests after resumption of GATT status. 
  Primary level [zu fu ji 4371 3637 4787] basic legislation is 
all the more a powerful weapon in trade negotiations. A task of 
top priority is to speed up legislation, so that there are laws 
to abide by for the cause of vigorously developing foreign trade. 
  Industrial policy is the basis of foreign trade policy and 
the latter is an extension of the former. It is not difficult 
for western countries to understand such a logic. This is 
because their economies have always been export-oriented, their 
domestic markets and foreign markets have been linked together 
since World War II, and their industrial policies have taken 
into account the needs of both domestic and foreign markets. In 
China, the system of planned economy had been carried out for 
years, domestic and foreign markets were seriously separated, 
and even the international market was artificially divided into 
so-called "two parallel world markets." This made China's 
industrial policies mainly emphasize domestic needs, with a 
small amount of exports to the Soviet Union and East European 
countries, without being able to go beyond the big circle. This 
has resulted in the fact that the technological level of China's 
products has lagged behind that of the world's advanced level 
for a long time, that China's export products are not up to 
grade, and that China can neither make full use of two markets 
nor two kinds of resources, leading to the situation of relying 
for years on a small number of products for foreign exchange 
earnings. China has taken a big step forward, we should say, 
toward a unified international market in recent years, but there 
is still quite a long way to go. It seems that it is necessary 
to join tracks finally with the international market and take 
part in a unified international market by "resumption of GATT 
status." 
  Fourth, big powers have become increasingly dependent on 
foreign economic relations and trade. For years in the past, 
there existed a view in international economic circles that 
foreign trade was not so important for big powers, but very 
important for small and island countries deficient of resources. 
Therefore, for them there is no question of the validity of the 
slogan "to build the country by trade," rather it is a tenet 
they must try to pursue. This has been confirmed by the 
fantastic achievements of Japan, the Asian "four small dragons", 
and even Switzerland, among other places. 
  Modern developments have shown that this point of view has 
the defect of being biased. The extent of big power dependence 
on foreign trade is ever intensified, which is even linked to 
social stability and employment. The establishment of GATT and 
many rounds of trade negotiations have indicated the importance 
attached by various countries to foreign trade. The proportion 
of foreign trade in the GNP of various countries is gradually 
going up. Such a trend becomes more obvious in the process of 
integration of the world economy. Moreover, trade between big 
powers (including blocs) is in fact playing the role of a 
locomotive in bringing along the development of the world 
economy. This is dominated by a fundamental economic 
law--developed economies, in particular, rapidly developing 
economies, need big markets, and they want to break through 
national boundaries and enter broader areas of activities; 
conversely, opportunities provided by the international market 
in turn promote the development of their own economy. The 
reality of China's economy is an example. 
  Fifth, commodity production is the crux. The front part of 
foreign trade is production, and the back is consumption. 
Foreign trade is circulation. Foreign economic and 
technological cooperation integrates the production process 
directly with foreign trade. What we emphasize is commodities, 
and not production under the circumstances of self-sufficient 
natural economy. Such production formation exists in regions 
where a commodity economy is undeveloped, and it can only be 
regarded as reproduction. The commodity economy we are talking 
about is large production under the circumstances of a market 
economy. The products turned out are not for our own 
consumption, but for meeting the market needs. Such production 
is precisely the basis of foreign trade. Now the problem we must 
solve is that China's production enterprises are not simply to 
meet the needs of domestic markets, but of both domestic and 
foreign markets, which is the goal of our work. This puts forth 
high requirements on the quality of commodities. I have always 
maintained the carrying out at home and abroad of a unified 
quality standard, and we cannot support foreign trade 
development by a "special faovrs" [xiao zao 1420 3501] method. 
There is no developed foreign trade without highly developed 
commodity production. 
  Sixth, the level of merchandizing is an important factor of 
foreign trade. A conceptual error to which ordinary people are 
easily subject is that general production is regarded as 
commodity production, and commodity production is mistaken for 
highly merchandized production. So-called merchandizing refers 
to intrinsic quality, production technology, mode of production, 
exterior design, packaging, stable quality, and unified 
specifications. Without quality, there is no commodity 
production, and without quantitative scale, there can't be 
commodity production either. 
  Seventh, trades which render services to foreign trade 
require major development. After the founding of new China, we 
have built on a preliminary basis trades that render services to 
foreign trade. After forty years of development, they have 
attained an initial scale, but there is still a gap in what is 
required. The building of wharves and ports, the capacity of 
land and sea transportation, and the means to promote exports, 
such as banking and insurance, are still far from meeting the 
objective needs of foreign trade development. Among them 
banking support in particular still lags behind need and is a 
bottleneck that restrains foreign trade exports, directly 
hampering the growth of export trade. 
<H5>  II. Discover, Safeguard, and Create Comparative Advantages </H5>
  If we review the history of international trade, 
particularly 
the history of various countries in "building the country by 
trade," we discover some common characteristics. These include: 
A long-term development strategy, necessary legislation by the 
state, a whole set of supportive policies, correct industrial 
guidance, and high quality commodity production that meets the 
needs of both domestic and foreign markets. These are the keys 
to realizing the strategy for foreign trade development, and 
other means are factors that ensure the realization of strategic 
principles. 
  Now the problem is how to organize and put into effect high 
quality and high grade commodity production. The author 
believes that to discover and create comparative advantages is 
the key to solving such a problem. 
  There are always some advantages for a country or a region 
in 
commodity production. The responsibility of operators is to be 
good at discovering and catching hold of these advantages and 
making full use of them. These advantages may be expressed in 
relatively cheap labor, inexpensive raw materials, or highly 
efficient production. Overall performance requires low 
production costs and strong market competitive power. We have 
repeatedly seen in practice that comparative advantages change 
and move. If we cannot consciously safeguard advantages, they 
slip away unconsciously. This is a problem to which 
policymakers and operators should pay attention at all times. 
Therefore, to safeguard comparative advantage is also a 
continuous process of improvement and enhancement. 
  China is a country with a large population, vast 
territory, and rich resources, which objectively provide 
advantages for China to develop commodity production, and China 
has ample conditions to give play to these comparative 
advantages. The key is to understand and distinguish where the 
advantages are after all and to set correct policies. 
  China has a clear labor advantage, and this advantage has 
been and is being brought into play. Since reform and opening 
up, the reason investors from outside China have kept pouring in 
is that they set store by China's cheap labor and the huge 
potential market. Labor intensive commodities with a ready 
market have developed at high speed within a short period of 
time. There has been a certain degree of blindness, and there 
have appeared chaotic phenomena of repeated importation, but it 
is an indisputable fact that the export of toys, TV sets, 
clothing, home electrical appliances, tape-recorders, 
audio-visual equipment which has been growing by leaps and 
bounds for years soon presents a scene of prosperity. Moreover, 
inaccessibility of market information in China and the 
phenomenon of production divorced from marketing instantly 
become things of the past. The general slogan of market economy 
"basing production on sales prospects" soon became a reality. 
China has become a big power in export trade in the sphere of 
these commodities. Though not the only country attaining 
excellence, China has become a decisive market force. 
China-made toys occupy one-third, and shoes, socks, and 
stockings one-fourth of the U.S. market. We have to admit that 
these are fantastic achievements. There is a fact which is 
often neglected here: The introduction of labor intensive 
commodities has promoted rapid development of industry as a 
whole at home, and organization, management, and sales channels 
have entered a new stage. It is difficult to overestimate the 
significance of this example which is more significant to a 
certain extent. 
  The comparative advantage of labor has indeed brought the 
greatest benefit to economic performance in China. China's 
textile export, especially of clothing, occupies an important 
place in export trade, taking up almost over one-fourth of total 
export volume. This is the direct outcome of China's making 
full use of the comparative advantage of cheap labor. We should 
not only continue giving play to this advantage, but should also 
raise it to a higher level--a new stage of high technological 
content, high added-value, and high efficiency. 
  However, we must face up to the problem that with the 
building of a market economy, the raising of the standard of the 
people, and prices rise, the cost of labor will also go up. In 
recent years the export of yarn and cloth as raw materials has 
met with difficulties. Beside other reasons, increases in the 
cost of labor and delays in the heightening of labor 
productivity are important reasons. Therefore, to continue 
giving play to comparative advantage, we must raise the grade of 
products, and speedily heighten labor productivity. If we still 
cannot achieve the goal after making efforts, then there is only 
one choice: Let this comparative advantage slip away, turn over 
a new leaf, and explore other advantages. This is an objective 
economic law which cannot be controlled subjectively. 
  Traditionally, another of china's comparative advantages is 
abundant raw materials and low prices. But from the point of 
view of market, this advantage is quite fragile. Due to 
climate, supply and demand, and cost, prices may rise or fall. 
China's present situation is that after an end to pricing 
policies which have been manipulated for years, prices of raw 
materials generally have gone up, thus gradually reducing the 
role of this advantage. 
  The cruel reality with which we are faced at present is how 
to safeguard the original comparative advantages and how to 
create new comparative advantages. Advantages can be created, 
and such creations are involve fierce competition. This is a 
road developed countries have down already. Only through 
concerted efforts on the part of the government (through 
policies), production departments, and foreign trade management 
departments can the creation of new advantages be completed. 
Now the situation is that the government has worked out a 
number of policies for encouraging exports and foreign trade 
management departments have take great initiatives. The most 
important thing is that production departments must understand 
that the survival of an enterprise rest in its rising head and 
shoulders above others in competition in both domestic and 
foreign markets and that the core of competition is human 
resources and technology. Only when this problem is overcome 
can production be upgraded, commodities of high technological 
content and best quality produced, and comparative advantages 
created. Therefore, the present policy should mainly be to pay 
attention to the production of commodities which are of high 
quality and high technological content. I believe that 
machinery and electronics products in a broad sense and complete 
sets of equipment have potential. Agriculture that earns 
foreign exchange, audio-visual equipment, high-grade clothing, 
high-grade shoes, socks, and stockings, and even low cost 
consumer goods subject to wear and tear are still areas that 
China should strive to develop continuously. 
<H5>  III. Financial Support Is the Motive Force for Major Foreign </H5>
Trade Development 
  If we make a comprehensive survey of the history of the 
world's foreign trade development, we can discover that foreign 
trade is the natural outcome of economic development and 
progress, and that it in turn also promotes the development of 
the economy. The history of World War I and World War II all 
the more explains that when the economy of some countries 
develops to a certain degree, their need for world market can 
get to such an extent as to unleash war at all costs to redivide 
the world market. The history of the world's foreign trade 
development has also proved another fact: To promote export, 
the state always introduces a number of policies to "encourage 
export and restrict import" to support foreign trade, of which 
most commonly seen are tax policy and financial policy, 
complemented by non-trade administrative means. 
  For decades when the planned economy was carried out, 
China exercised a system of control over foreign trade and plans 
were centers. With plans, everything is set, and foreign trade 
was supported by various fields. Under the environment of the 
time when the economy was not quite developed, plans did play 
their proper role. Today, we are carrying out the system of a 
socialist market economy, and markets becomes the subject of 
economic life. Obviously, the original foreign trade system must 
change with changes in the economic system. The characteristics 
of such changes are abandoning the original management method of 
mandatory plans, using necessary administrative means to promote 
the building of market mechanisms, and standardizing foreign 
trade activities according to law on the basis of a number of 
legal regulations. So- called economic law consists, in the 
first place, of the law of supply and demand, the law of 
competition, and the law of superior things winning out and 
inferior ones being eliminated through competition. 
  It requires investment to take the road of stepping up the 
strength of competition, carrying out technological 
transformation, and turning out upgraded products. With foreign 
trade developed to the present stage, the sharpest problem which 
arises is the integration of foreign trade with financial 
capital; in a certain sense, this is also the natural extension 
of integration of industry with financial capital. 
Unfortunately we have been a little late to understand this a 
law, which has affected the growth rate of China's exports and 
delays the renovation of China's export product mix. 
Agricultural, sideline, native, and special products that 
contend in the domestic market for sources of goods have long 
been China's major export commodities. Conversely, products of 
low production cost and high technological content hardly 
developed their strength for a long time. If we compare 
ourselves with South Korea, one of the "four small dragons", it 
forms a striking contrast. It took a very short time for it to 
change from the primary export stage to a high-level export 
stage, and the export of its technological products, especially 
automobiles, gave it an advantage within a short period of time, 
making it a major export force. Even such competitive opponents 
as Japan also cry out in alarm: "Terrific!" 
  One may well say that a Chinese import-export bank should be 
set up and emerge as the times require. Although some people 
describe it as "it comes out at long last after thousands of 
calls," but it is born after all! It would undoubtedly increase 
the potential for the developing cause of China's foreign trade. 
<H5>  IV. Make Full Use of the Opportunity Brought by the </H5>
"Resumption of GATT" Status, and Build Up the Concept of a Big 
Unified Market 
  In modern world economic development, Karl Marx's thesis 
that 
markets have no national boundaries has been repeatedly proved 
to be absolutely correct, and contemporary developments have 
further testified to the existence of this law. People have 
been compelled to take consciously or unconsciously various 
measures to promote the realization of a big unified market. 
The European Economic Community, the North America Free Trade 
Zone, and various proposed regional trade blocs do not just make 
no distinction between national boundaries, but also want to 
achieve a high degree of unification. As an outcome of the 
Uruguay Round talks, the world trade organization is a new 
attempt at these efforts. 
  China's point of view of building up a big unified market is 
related to traditional domestic and foreign markets. In fact, 
with China's resumption of GATT status, we must write a full 
stop, or put an end to our traditional concepts. By then, we 
must take the world as the stage in commodity production and 
sales markets. If we work efficiently, it will pave the way for 
China to move toward world markets; if we are not 
self-conscious, and our measures are not efficient, it may lead 
to practice being in position and concepts not being in position 
with a resulting lack of vitality in the face of a vast big 
world market. We may be open in the domestic market, but cannot 
make full use of world market. We are only put to much trouble 
by world market, but cannot enjoy its benefits. This raises the 
question of how to make full use of the opportunity brought by 
the "resumption of GATT" status. The "resumption of GATT" 
status will bring China, I believe, the following opportunities: 
A vast world market, a favorable and equal trade environment, 
MFN treatment in general and on a multilateral basis, full 
enjoyment of a generalized preferential system (so long as per 
capita national income is low, and the developing country status 
remains unchanged, China is entitled to such treatment), the 
right to participate in working out trade regulations, the right 
to protect young industries, the right to obtain the latest 
information on economic relations and trade, the right to 
protect intellectual property, and other rights. 
  China's rapid economic development inevitably puts forward 
new requirements on foreign market, and the "resumption of GATT" 
status precisely fits in with this need. It is a law that a 
powerful economy inevitably leads to powerful foreign trade. We 
must comply with and understand this law, and use it to serve 
our purposes. 
  It goes without saying that the "resumption of GATT" status 
will bring China opportunities and also require China to carry 
out commitments, which are no more than appropriately opening up 
the market and getting prepared for competitions. But one thing 
that makes people feel comfortable is that various countries 
benefit rather than are harmed to a varying degree after joining 
GATT. I think this has something to do with the age in which we 
live. Various countries are making efforts to develop their own 
economies, and join GATT after having made certain achievements. 
In other words, they join GATT when they have the conditions to 
make full use of GATT's favored treatments. This is even more 
so China's situation. 
  As for competition, we should look at it from the positive 
side, and see that competition yields achievement. China's over 
90 billion dollars in exports last year has proved that China 
has the ability to compete and succeed. As to the impact on some 
of China's industries, I think as long as we are fully prepared, 
take the world as the stage, improve quality and efficiency, and 
give play to comparative advantages, it is fully possible for 
China to win out in competition. If some of our products are in 
fact "counterfeit and inferior," they should be eliminated, 
shouldn't they? It is fully possible for Chinese enterprises, 
after 15 years of tempering through reform and opening up, to 
participate and win out in international market competition, 
pushing China's economic level to a higher stage.

  [Text] Hong Kong 23 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce has recently adopted 
measures to tighten the supervision and investigation of 
foreign-funded enterprises' capital contributions. 
  The measures stipulate that enterprises in this category 
with 
registered capital up to and including $2 million should 
contribute the whole sum within six months after the operational 
license is issued. Those with registered capital between $2 
million and $5 million inclusive should contribute the whole sum 
within a year after the issuance of their operational licenses, 
and those with a registered capital between $5 million and $10 
million inclusive should contribute the whole sum within two 
years after the issuance of operational licenses. Those with a 
registered capital ranging from $10 million to $30 million 
inclusive may have the deadline appropriately extended according 
to their conditions, with the approval of the organizations in 
charge of examination and approval and the organizations in 
charge of registration. If enterprises violate the regulations 
of the departments in charge of registration, these departments 
may directly decide to suspend their operating licenses. 
  The new measures also provide: 
  It is totally unacceptable for the Chinese side in a 
foreign-funded joint venture to contribute the registered 
capital on its foreign partner's behalf. When the organizations 
in charge of registration discover that this has occurred, these 
cases will be handled as failures to contribute capital. If the 
Chinese side in a joint venture is found to have provided 
foreign investors with nominal shares as a reward or has 
borrowed the name or materials of some foreign businessmen to 
deceitfully acquire an operating license, as soon as the case is 
verified, the joint venture's license should be suspended and 
the appropriate penalty should be meted out according to the 
relevant laws and decrees. 
  State-owned enterprises that use their stock assets to apply 
for running joint ventures or enterprises in cooperation with 
foreign business enterprises should simultaneously submit the 
Chinese side's asset evaluation reports, which must be certified 
by the administration of state assets. 
  For joint ventures in which a foreign partner invests by 
providing equipment or other goods in kind, the real prices of 
the equipment and goods must be explicitly stated in the 
contract, which must be certified by an intermediary notary 
authority acceptable to the two sides. 
  When a central-level enterprise sells shares to foreign 
firms 
or uses part or all of its state-owned stock assets to launch 
joint ventures or cooperate with foreign firms, it must submit 
documents to the relevant state department for examination. At 
this moment, no approvals or registrations will be granted to 
the local authorities who want to use the stock assets of the 
state enterprises -- the enterprises operating a single trade or 
running a business which incorporates various trades -- to 
launch joint-venture projects with foreign firms. For the 
projects of this type that are already in existence, a good job 
should be done of weeding them out in coordination with the 
organizations in charge of examination and approval. 
  In the contracts submitted by joint ventures with Chinese 
and 
foreign investment or cooperative enterprises, if there are 
clauses which violate the principle of shared interest and 
responsibility for running risks, separately provide guarantees 
for investment loans according to the investment proportion of 
the two sides involved, or make the Chinese side guarantee 
profit rates of foreign investment through loans, bonds or other 
instruments, the organizations in charge of registration are 
authorized to require the parties involved in joint ventures to 
revise them according to the stipulations of state laws and 
decrees; otherwise, their examination and registration will not 
be granted. 
  Figures from economic circles have indicated that these 
measures presented by China primarily target the low rate of 
foreign capital actually contributed; presently, the foreign 
capital contributed as investment in China accounts for only 20 
percent or so of the negotiated amount.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Controls on Fixed Assets Investment Achieve </F>
Preliminary Success"] 
  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- China's efforts to 
control over-investment in fixed assets have scored preliminary 
success so far but the pressure for fixed asset investment is 
still heavy. 
  Since the beginning of this year the rate of investment 
increase has declined. During the first four months of the 
year, investments by state-owned enterprises grew by 38.4 
percent, a 30.5 percent slow-down from the same period last year. 
  The investment structure is becoming more balanced. More 
money is being spent on projects involving raw materials, 
transportation and telecommunications. The investment fever in 
development zones, holiday resorts, villas and real estate has 
been lowered. 
  In addition, loans to key state projects increased by more 
than 10 billion yuan in the first four months compared to the 
same period of last year, and some 20 percent of the capital has 
been delivered. Typically, about 15 percent of planned 
capitalization is fulfilled in the first quarter. 
  As a result of the controls, the marketing of materials for 
production has become stable. 
  The State Council ruled in January this year to continue the 
efforts to control investment in fixed assets as the government 
aims to maintain its gross national product (GNP) growth rate at 
9 percent and the growth of prices within 10 percent this year. 
  The investment growth rate of state-owned enterprises has 
been estimated at about 30 percent for the first half of this 
year, said Wei Liqun, a spokesman for the State Planning 
Commission. 
  Qiu Xiaohua, a young economist with the state statistics 
bureau, said that if the 30 percent growth rate target can be 
achieved nationwide in the first half of the year, inflationary 
pressure will be greatly eased and China's economy will grow at 
a steady rate. China's reforms and opening to the outside world 
will go more smoothly, he said. 
  If the growth rate for investment in fixed assets can be 
kept 
at 30 percent for the whole year, he added, the total investment 
in fixed assets for the year will marginally surpass the 13 
trillion yuan target set by the central government, but it will 
still be a factor conducive to China's overall economic growth. 
  He stressed that although certain achievements have been 
made, controls are still not powerful enough since the 
investment mechanism reform is yet to make a significant impact. 
Local investment fever is still high and many localities are 
eager to construct more projects without paying attention to the 
overall economic situation. 
  "Investments might increase rapidly if the controls are not 
carried out strictly," he said, "because the investment 
mechanism in which the local government has the final say in 
investment has not changed completely." 
  The economist said that reform of the investment mechanism 
should be carried out in such aspects as making certain laws and 
regulations to safeguard the interests of investors and to 
guarantee a scientific and standardized investment procedure. 
  In addition, he said, investment decision-making rights 
should be transferred from the government to enterprises 
themselves. And more overseas investment should be exploited.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 30 (XINHUA) -- China had exported 34.8 
billion U.S. dollars worth of products by May 10 this year, up 
by 45.8 percent over the same period last year, while imports 
also reached 29.8 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 33.9 
percent. 
  This means that a series of reforms in foreign currency, 
finance and tax and foreign trade structure, especially those 
eliminating subsidies for exports, have proved effective, said 
an official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation here attending the opening ceremony of the Tianjin 
Export Commodity Fair Saturday [28 May]. 
  According to the official, China's foreign-funded 
enterprises 
imported 11.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of products, surpassing 
their export volume by 2.9 billion dollars. 
  However, the official admitted that this year's foreign 
trade 
has been affected by price hikes, resulting in the decline of 
export efficiency and shortages in capital and raw materials. 
The ministry is trying to work out an effective way to further 
boost imports and exports, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (CNS) -- The State Administration 
for Industry and Commerce has recently listed ten main provinces 
and cities which accommodated the greatest number of three type 
foreign funded enterprises while at the same time the ten main 
foreign countries and regions which made the largest investment 
in China were also selected, according to a national meeting on 
the registration and administration of foreign funded 
enterprises. 
  There were 167,500 three type foreign funded enterprises as 
of late last year since the implementation of reform and the 
opening to the outside world 14 years ago. Of them the 
Sino-foreign joint ventured enterprises made up 107,800, 
Sino-foreign cooperative ventured enterprises 25,500 and solely 
foreign funded enterprises 34,000. The ten main provinces and 
cities seeing the largest number of foreign funded enterprises 
were ranked in descending order as follows. Guangdong Province 
same first, followed by Jiangsu Province, Shandong Province, 
Fujian Province, Zhejiang Province, Shanghai Municipality, 
Hainan Province, Liaoning Province, Beijing Municipality, and 
Tianjin Municipality. 
  Countries and regions where three type foreign funded 
enterprises came from and made investment in China rose to 146 
as of late 1993. The ten main countries and regions which saw 
the greatest number of such enterprises run in China were put in 
a descending order. Hong Kong topped others and were followed 
by Taiwan, the United States, Japan, Macao, Singapore, South 
Korea, Canada, Thailand and Australia.

  [Text] Guangzhou--A new regulation governing Guangzhou's 
foreign funded firms is being reviewed by the city government 
and is to be implemented as soon as it receives final approval. 
  Officials said that although Guangzhou has succeeded in 
attracting overseas investment, it has filed to maintain proper 
oversight of overseas-invested firms. 
  Over the past few months, more than 100 such enterprises in 
Guangzhou that failed to meet their financial commitments have 
been closed down. 
  Of $80 billion in investments called for in contracts, only 
$29.5 billion has actually been provided. 
  Yan Guanghua, joint venture boss for the local trade 
commission said the regulation and crackdown willing 
overseas-funded firms into line and protect their interests. 
  "The majority of overseas-funded firms are following the 
laws 
and regulations, and their legal rights and interests are 
protected by the government," Yan said. 
  Guangzhou has nearly 5,000 overseas-funded firms. Last year 
their total industrial output was 30.2 billion yuan ($3.5 
billion) and their exports were worth $1.4 billion. However, 
Yan complained that some foreign partners are not honest when 
doing business with Chinese in Guangzhou. 
  Some fail to meet their financial commitments or escape 
abroad with bundles of money. Others intentionally quote higher 
prices for imported equipment while deflating their export 
prices. 
  The new regulation authorizes the withdrawal of licenses for 
unfunded or suspended firms. 
  It also specifies that export products listed among foreign 
country's anti-dumping items should be reported to the local 
trade organization as soon as possible and be subject to 
investigation. 
  In addition, workers are allowed to organize legitimate 
labour associations, and firms should respond to that effect. 
  Finally, firms should not be managed on contractual terms 
without government approval.

<F P=106> [By Zheng Caixiong: "Overseas Aid Sought To Prop Up State </F>
Firms"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou--The Guangzhou municipal government will 
soon make 50 money-losing State enterprises available for 
foreign investment. 
  Foreign investors will be encouraged to buy entire firms for 
technological renovation and expansion of production, hold some 
stakes, set up joint ventures transfer equipment and 
technologies, and even join in managing the firms. 
  According to a government official who declined to be named 
36 per cent of State enterprises in the city lost money last 
year. Together he said they lost about 3 billion yuan ($345 
million). 
  "To save these State enterprises, which in previous years 
were backbone businesses, we need to increase investment, import 
new technologies and advanced equipment and introduce new 
management systems," the official said. 
  Some factories in the busy downtown areas will be allowed to 
move to the city's outskirts and develop service industries in 
co-operation with overseas partners. 
  To attract foreign investors, Mayor Li Ziliu will lead a 
delegation to the United States early in June. 
  On the delegation's list for foreign investment are new- and 
hi-technology projects and infrastructural works such as the 
second phase of the Metro subway, light railways, the second 
phase of the Zhujiang Power Plant and Pumped Water Storage Power 
Plant, and expressways. 
  The delegation will also try to sell to foreign investors 
the 
property rights to most State enterprises for future development. 
  The delegation will consist of more than 150 people, 
including government officials, company managers and directors, 
and will hold trade fairs in several cities during its tour from 
June 5 to 20. Municipal authorities are also planning a similar 
fair in Hong Kong in November. The government official expects 
Guangzhou's booming economy, political stability and improving 
investment climate to attract more overseas investors to join in 
the city's economy construction. To improve its investment 
environment Guangzhou has embarked on an infrastructural 
construction campaign that includes the Metro, the Ring 
Expressway, a 115,000-ton ethylene factory and the Zhujiang 
Power Plant. Meanwhile, the government intends to establish a 
solid framework for a market economy and encourage more 
companies to re-orient themselves toward a market economy. 
Within three years, all 20,000 enterprises in Guangzhou are to 
become corporations, preferably shareholding ones. All will be 
guided by the Company Law that takes effect July 1 and will be 
run by their directors according to free-market standards. 
  "Government officials will no longer interfere in the 
enterprises' management as they did in previous years," the 
official said. Foreign investment and foreign trade in 
Guangzhou have grown steadily this year. In the first four 
months the city used more than $640 million foreign capital, up 
84.6 percent over the same period last year. During this period 
Guangzhou exported nearly $1.1 billion worth of goods, an 
increase of 32 percent.

<F P=106> [By Hang Yuan] </F>
  [Text] Senior bankers in China have pledged to turn the 
national currency, the yuan, into a fully convertible unit in an 
effort to reverse an exodus of capital from the country. 
  Zhou Xiaochuan, Vice-Governor of the central bank, the 
People's Bank of China, recently told the nation's bankers that 
full convertibility of the yuan had been given top priority by 
the leadership as reform reached a critical stage. 
  But speaking on the same subject, Xu Bin, Deputy Director of 
the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC), stressed 
that full convertibility would be attempted only if the 
authorities were convinced it would not cause market disruption. 
And Mr Xu hinted that the authorities had no intention of 
changing the present exchange rate -- U.S.$1 to 8.7 yuan -- and 
would not allow "significant" depreciation of the yuan even 
after it became fully convertible. 
  But Mr Xu warned that the Government faced increasing 
difficulties in maintaining a stable foreign exchange market as 
China faced a huge foreign trade deficit, double-digit inflation 
and high interest rates. 
  Although Mr Zhou did not give a specific target date for 
full 
convertibility, he said it was considered an essential step to 
reform. "Full convertibility is not the goal of reform, but an 
indispensable step in achieving our ultimate goal of reform and 
opening (to the outside world)," Mr Zhou said. 
  "Pledging to turn the yuan into a convertible currency helps 
to build up public confidence in our national currency," said Mr 
Zhou. "[We also believe] full convertibility would not have a 
great impact on our national reserves." 
  According to Mr Zhou, the Government was now inclined to 
adopt a two-step approach to turn the yuan into a fully 
convertible currency. The Government would first lift controls 
over servicing accounts such as those for trade and investment. 
Full convertibility in the marketplace would follow later. The 
latest remarks by senior bankers were seen by analysts as 
indications that reformist officials were keen to push ahead 
with controversial policies before the death of paramount leader 
Deng Xiaoping. 
  Full convertibility of the yuan is also one of the 
conditions 
China has to fulfil for re-entry to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. 
  According to Vice-Governor Zhou, the Government understands 
that the conversion restriction does not help to stop money 
leaving the country. On the contrary, the restriction is a 
disincentive for China-funded businesses to remit profits home. 
He also cited a survey in the United States which showed that 
China had suffered a net outflow of capital into the U.S. and 
much of the cash was being siphoned out of China through 
"suspicious channels". 
  Quoting sources in Hong Kong, the Vice-Governor said it was 
believed a large number of China-funded companies had reinvested 
their profits in high-yield businesses in the territory to 
escape the foreign exchange controls imposed by the Beijing 
Government. He said there was no reason why China should suffer 
a net outflow of capital when the country's interest rates and 
rate of return on investment were both higher than those offered 
in most developed countries. 
  In 1992, more than U.S.$17 billion (HK$131.2 billion) of 
foreign money flowed into China, up 50 per cent on the previous 
year. Meanwhile, Mr Xu denied the authorities had intervened in 
the markets and claimed the stability in foreign exchange 
markets was the result of market forces. 
  "Not only has the SAEC not tried to support (the 8.7 yuan 
exchange rate) by buying in the markets, other departments have 
not intervened through administrative methods," he said. "This 
is really an exchange rate [set by] the market." 
  It was the consensus among foreign investors and bankers 
that 
China was able to maintain the 8.7-yuan exchange rate through 
government intervention.

  [Text] Escalating grievances relating to the Shanghai and 
Shenzhen stock exchanges and a top-level power struggle forced 
chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), 
Liu Hongru, to hand in his resignation, Beijing sources say. 
Although his imminent departure has yet to be announced, 
securities experts in China and overseas have already begun to 
wonder whether his resignation will mean any policy changes on 
mainland enterprises' domestic and overseas listings. 
  "The general feeling in China's securities industry is that 
(Mr) Liu should take the blame for the B-share doldrums in the 
two mainland stock markets, which has lasted for more than a 
year," one source said. "He has been criticised by the mainland 
exchange officials as having been paying too much attention to 
the A-share market and has neglected the (development of the) 
B-share market. Such a situation was crucial in his downfall," 
the source added. 
  A securities watchdog spokeswoman in Beijing refused to 
comment on the strong rumours of Mr Liu's resignation. When 
questioned, she said: "I don't know...this is not a question 
that we would be in a position to answer". 
  Mr Liu seemed to favour overseas listings in the form of H- 
shares, preferring this form of raising capital to cultivating a 
solid infrastructure for B-share markets. The 64-year-old, 
Soviet-educated economic technocrat is a former deputy governor 
of the People's Bank of China and vice-minister of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy. 
  He is regarded as China's best-known banker overseas. He was 
appointed the central bank's vice-governor in 1982 and has 
represented China at meetings of the International Monetary 
Fund. Mr Liu was appointed to the hot seat when the national 
securities watchdog was set up in 1992. His appointment at that 
time was read as a compromise of interests between the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the central bank. 
  The development of the securities industry in China has long 
been a power game between the two entities. Before the 
setting-up of the national-securities watchdog, stock market 
development was nominally under the Stock Exchange Executive 
Council (SEEC) but in practice was under the supervision of 
central bank. The bank played both a policy-making and an 
executive role through the financial divisions of its local 
branches in Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  When the CSRC was formed, the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy appeared to have in turn gained an 
upper hand. But struggles went on behind the scene. "(The) 
CSRC is a coveted body in China. It represents influence and 
money," one local analyst said. 
  It is said Mr Liu will be succeeded by the 54-year-old Hong 
Hu, who is presently the vice-minister of the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economy. His formal appointment will 
underline the diminishing role of the central bank in the 
securities industry. Swiss Bank Corporation associate director 
Lawrence Ang noted that the development of the mainland 
securities industry had reached a critical point, and it made Mr 
Liu's departure more unusual. "His apparent preference for 
H-share listings overseas, American listings in particular, plus 
the recently announced measure of doubling the number of B 
shares by the end of the year have been extremely 
controversial," Mr Ang said.

<F P=106> [By Shuang Mu: "Broader B-Share Issues Weighed as a </F>
Stimulus"] 
  [Text] China is considering expanding the issuance of B 
shares, which are exclusively for foreign investors, to 
stimulate the sluggish B-share market. 
  Also, said an official with the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission, firms outside Shanghai and Shenzhen would be allowed 
to issue B shares in the future. 
  So far, 42 enterprises have issued B shares with a total 
capital of 3.01 billion yuan ($346 million). All are in 
Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  Many enterprises outside the two cities want to issue B 
shares, because they think it is a quick way to pool foreign 
capital. 
  The regulatory official said some large enterprises dealing 
in energy, communications, transportation and railways will be 
selected to issue B shares. 
  To ensure that the expansion proceeds smoothly, he said, the 
most important thing is to improve the trading mechanism and the 
information-disclosure system. 
  Supervision over listed B-share companies will be enhanced, 
and the issuance, trading and settlement of B shares will be 
improved. 
  He said authorities are drafting a set of national 
regulations governing B shares. 
  When they are adopted, he said, the State will consider 
listing B-share companies outside Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  But the official ruled out establishing a third market for 
trading B shares besides the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities 
exchanges. 
  While expanding the domestic B-share market, the country is 
also considering the listing of B-share companies on the Hong 
Kong Stock Market. 
  Meanwhile, the country is considering expanding the investor 
base by allowing B-share firms to issue American Depository 
Receipts, convertible bonds and other stock-related instruments. 
  China opened its B-share market in November 1991, when the 
Shanghai Vacuum Electronics Co Ltd signed the first agreement to 
issue B shares. 
  Creating B shares, which are denominated in renminbi but 
traded in foreign exchange, was based on two considerations. 
  First, that the establishment of a stock market available to 
foreign investors would help Chinese enterprises gain access to 
foreign capital. 
  Second, that, since the renminbi is not freely convertible, 
foreign investors and stock exchange firms are limited in their 
scope of business and must be separated from the A-share market, 
which is devoted to Chinese investors. 
  In this way the development of a domestic market could be 
shielded from the influence of foreign factors while the 
interests of overseas investors, in turn, would be protected. 
  Securities authorities have come to realize that the 
long-term division of the A- and B-share markets could create 
many problems. 
  "From the view of progress, the two market should be 
merged," 
said Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission. 
  The most essential prerequisite for the merger, Liu said, 
would be the free convertibility of renminbi. 
  Technically, the timing depends on the prices on the A-share 
and B-share markets. 
  Some local investors have suggested opening the B-share 
market to Chinese. 
  Analysts say that opening the B-share market to domestic 
investors would give it a big boost. They note that, as of the 
end of April, individual foreign exchange savings in the Bank of 
China surpassed $10 billion, enough capital to easily push up 
the price of B shares.

<F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>
  [Text] China's securities regulators and police have 
jointly issued an order to check increasing market violations 
amid the bearish markets which threaten to impinge on social 
stability. 
  The order warns of increasing disputes, suicides and 
malpractice in the stock markets and calls for more 
professionalism and tighter control over shareholders' meetings. 
  The move comes as mainlanders see their investments dipping 
by the day on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with no 
recovery in sight. 
  Because of the slump in the market, some investors have been 
unable to endure their losses and have committed suicide; 
brokers have turned to insider trading or used public money to 
speculate on stocks, and there has been an increase in disputes 
between investors and securities departments. 
  Published in China Securities News by the Shanghai Public 
Security Bureau, the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of 
China and the Shanghai Securities Administration Office, the 
order says that last year and in the first quarter this year the 
authorities discovered 49 cases of speculation with public money 
totalling 91.66 million yuan (about HK$81.71 million). 
  To address the three problems, the order calls for better 
control of information, promotion of better understanding among 
the public of investing in stocks and a complete ban on 
unauthorised information and illegal stock publications. 
  It urges more professionalism among stockbrokers, an end to 
fraud and imposters trading shares belonging to other people, 
and a ban on trading on credit. 
  Last month, China's legal authorities uncovered rampant 
stock 
market violations by brokers, bankers and even regulators. 
  An investigation by the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
reportedly found violations to be common, including brokers 
cheating investors, market officials taking bribes and managers 
using company funds to trade shares. Two weeks ago, Shanghai 
People's Procuratorate confirmed that Ma Yue, deputy-general 
manager of Shanghai Haitong Securities, was under criminal 
investigation on unspecified charges. 
  Analysts say fraud is not uncommon in fledging securities 
markets, where necessary legislation is passed as the market 
grows. 
  The problem has been compounded in China where the 
government 
hierarchy is complicated. 
  "What I'm afraid of is insider trading, because companies 
are 
all state-owned and brokerage houses are all state-owned as 
well," an analyst said. 
  "Regulators have to look through malpractices such as 
insider 
trading. This is particularly important for B shareholders who 
do not have much influence on companies." 
  The order says firms holding public shareholders' meetings 
must inform the police five days in advance with information 
including the date, time, place, content, the number taking part 
and planned security measures. 
  "If incidents such as the smashing of cars, illegal marches 
or demonstrations, attacking (Communist) Party or government 
buildings happen, firm steps must be taken to prevent them and 
stop matters from getting out of hand," it said. One recent 
shareholders' meeting saw the board of directors yield to the 
demands of minority shareholders who are suffering from the 
falling stock market. 
  Examples of changes to boards' payout plans include Bao An 
Enterprise, Shenzhen Gintian Industry, Shenzhen Konka 
Electronics and China Vanke. All are Shenzhen-listed companies. 
  Concern has been raised over the power of shareholders 
during 
meetings and whether changes to payout proposals should be 
backed by rational and reasonable justification.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The planned amount of 
27 billion yuan worth of two-year state treasury bonds for this 
year was sold out by the end of May 25, five days earlier than 
the target date, according to sources from the Ministry of 
Finance here today. 
  In addition, the public have purchased about 40.25 billion 
yuan three-year bonds so far, accounting for 67 percent of the 
total issue of 60 billion yuan. 
  Treasury bond sales has been rather smooth this year, thanks 
to the sound economic environment and swelling personal purses, 
said a finance official in charge of the issue. 
  He was confident that the remaining 20 billion three-year 
bonds would be sold out by the end of June as planned. 
  The interest rate for 1994 two-year treasury bonds is 13 
percent, and 13.96 percent for three-year ones. Both are higher 
than the interest rates for bank deposits of the same term.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Work is progressing full 
steam ahead on a new high-tech industrial belt along its 
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu expressway in north China. 
  The whole scheme is expected to be completed in about 15 
years, according to a state plan. 
  This is one of the five high-tech belts so far planned in 
the 
country's coastal areas for the coming decades. 
  The others are located in the areas along northeast China's 
Shenyang-Dalian expressway, east China's Shandong peninsula and 
Suzhou and Wuxi city, and south China's Pearl River Delta. 
  At the eastern end of the expressway lies the Tianjin 
development area and bonded zone, a hot spot for high-tech 
investment from many world-known transnational companies. 
  Not long ago, the world's biggest enzyme producer invested 
250 million U.S. dollars in a modern biological plant in the 
development zone. 
  Midway along the expressway is arising the Wuqing 
development 
zone, another high-tech industrial park, covering an area of 
24.8 square kilometers. 
  Approved by the state in 1991, the Wuqing zone is the site 
of 
114 foreign-funded joint ventures in electronics, biology, new 
materials and new energy. 
  The Japanese-funded Tianjin Quartz Vibrator Company, built 
in 
the zone with an investment of five billion yen, went into 
operation recently. 
  About 40 kilometers from the country's capital Beijing is 
the 
Langfang economic and technical development zone in Hebei 
Province. The infrastructural facilities of the zone, including 
transport, telecommunications and water and power supply 
systems, have been completed. 
  It has attracted many governmental agencies and research 
institutes which plan to build a number of advanced 
technological projects and laboratories in the zone. Some of 
the 16 foreign-funded joint ventures so far built in the zone 
have gone into production. 
  At the western end of the expressway is the Beijing 
development zone, which also has attracted a group of 
international consortiums such as GE of the United States, JVC 
of Japan and Bayer of Germany. 
  Within the three-square-kilometer first phase area of the 
zone, more than 50 joint ventures have been built, involving 850 
million U.S. dollars. 
  In addition, adjacent to the zone, an international 
container 
station and a goods transfer center have been built along with 
the requisite customs office and commodity inspection bureau, 
which facilitate procedures for imports and exports. 
  Started in 1988 and opened to traffic in September 1993, the 
expressway is 142 kilometers long, linking Beijing to the port 
city Tianjin. 
  The plan for developing the high-tech industrial belt 
alongside the expressway was formulated by a group of Chinese 
economists after a one-year investigation into the U.S. "Silicon 
Valley" and expressway 128 in Boston. 
  Ma Qihui, an official with the Tianjin Commission of Science 
and Technology, who participated in the economic belt planning, 
said that the area boasts many advantages that will allow the 
belt to boom. 
  She said that in Beijing and Tianjin there are more than one 
hundred institutions of higher learning and thousands of 
research institutes with an army of technical talents that 
account for 37 percent of the country's total. 
  "This is the most distinct feature of the belt," he [as 
received] said. 
  Analysts here believe that the rise of the industrial belt 
will power regional economic growth. Its influence will be felt 
throughout north China and even the whole country.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China is to develop and 
put into production at least 300 new and major chemical products 
every year between 1996 and 2000 under a government program to 
prepare the chemical industry for the next century. 
  Minister of the Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian said today that 
by 2000 some 65 percent of China's 1,200 major chemical products 
should meet international standards. Moreover, fine chemical 
products should account for half of the chemical production. 
  She was speaking to about 300 officials and experts at the 
third national conference on scientific and technological 
progress in the chemical industry, who are to give the finishing 
touches over the next three days to the 1996-2000 program for 
science and technology. 
  The program aims to bring the industry up to international 
standards, and calls for concentrating human and financial 
resources on projects that have a direct bearing on the entire 
national economy and problems that affect the development of the 
chemical industry as a whole, she added. 
  "We aim at narrowing the gap between China and the developed 
countries in the chemical industry, and we'll prepare ourselves 
for tackling issues of key importance to China's development in 
the 21st century," she said. 
  Under the program, priority will be given to nine fields, 
including the development of new catalysts and gas separation 
methods, as well as biochemistry and the application of 
computers to the chemical industry. 
  China is also to become capable of designing and building 
synthetic ammonia plants producing a total of 300,000 tons a 
year with natural gas as the material and urea plants capable of 
turning out 520,000 tons a year using what is known as the 
"ammonia steam process". 
  It will also develop six series of fine chemical products up 
to the latest world standards, including insecticides, dyestuffs 
and chemicals used in electronics products. 
  "Our policy is to concentrate on what is advanced and new, 
on 
complete sets of equipment and special-purpose equipment, on 
what saves energy and on what is environmentally clean," Gu told 
the meeting. 
  By 2000, she said, high-tech enterprises will be yielding 
ten 
percent of China's chemical industrial output. Work will also 
be done to promote the nationwide use of 30 items of chemical 
technology which have proved important to the technological 
progress of the whole chemical industry. 
  The participants are also to discuss how to commercialize 
research findings, Gu said, adding that the problem of research 
and design institutes being separate from enterprises "must be 
overcome". 
  The minister also called for expanding the industry's 
external co-operation, suggesting that domestic research and 
design institutes establish "sister relations" with 
internationally known institutes for the joint development of 
science and technology. 
  Over the past two years, she noted, the ministry has signed 
agreements on all-round co-operation with a dozen transnational 
companies, including Du Pont of the United States and Bell of 
Germany. 
  Also signed were agreements with the GE company of the 
United 
States and the BASF company of Germany on co-operation in 120 
specific projects.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Minister of Power </F>
Industry Shi Dazhen: "Power Industry To Accelerate Reform"] 
  [Text] China's power industry is responsible for meeting 
the ever-increasing demand for electricity as the country builds 
up its socialist market economy. Without the necessary supply 
of power, the entire economy will be bottlenecked. 
  The country's power industry has been improving steadily 
since 1975 when Deng Xiaoping was in charge of the work of the 
State Council. But the most rapid progress has been recorded in 
the last six years, as 12 to 14 million kilowatts of generating 
capacity has been installed annually. 
  Nevertheless the industry still faces a shortfall. 
  This so-called electricity bottleneck has, in fact, lasted 
for 24 consecutive years. Today, electricity production falls 
short of demand by 20 per cent and some 120 million rural 
Chinese still live in the dark. 
  Rapid expansion of the power industry is necessary. 
  During their industrialization, some countries in the world 
have invested more than 2 per cent of their gross national 
product (GNP) annually to expand their power industries. 
However, between 1980 and 1992, only 1.24 percent of China's 
GNP per annum was invested in the power sector. 
  Construction of power grids has also lagged behind demand. 
  Moreover, investment in applied science and technology for 
power generation has been declining. 
  The fund-raising mechanism for enterprises in the power 
industry should be implemented and a scientific and rational 
pricing system for the use of electricity should be set up. 
  That electricity is a commodity was ignored as recently as a 
few years ago, and so fund-raising for construction projects of 
the power industry from both the domestic and international 
financial markets was severely hindered. 
  Plants, equipment and the technology used in many power 
stations and transmission grids are outdated. This results in a 
waste of generated energy. 
  As to the future, the Ministry of Power Industry (MPI) is 
considering increasing China's generating capacity by about 15 
million kilowatts per year between 1995 and 1997. 
  Beyond that to the year 2000, 20 million kilowatts are to be 
added annually. Assuming China carry out this plan [as 
published], its total installed electricity capacity will be 
about 300 million kilowatts by the turn of the century. 
  If China's GNP grows 8 to 9 per cent annually, the estimated 
generating capacity of 300 million kilowatts should by and large 
ease the power shortage nationwide, making it possible for each 
county in the country and 95 per cent of the country's rural 
households to have access to electricity. 
  It is hoped that the State, with the backing of relevant 
departments, will increase its annual investment so that the 
input constitutes at least 2 per cent of GNP, the minimum 
required to ensure the industry's steady development. 
  In line with the central government's policy of allocating 
funds for building key State projects the MPI will compete for 
preferential policies. Particularly, low-interest loans for 
rural regions in the country's minority, poor and remote areas 
will be sought to develop the power industry. 
  The MPI will also encourage the development of new power 
sources. the transmission of power via grids from energy-rich 
provinces to those suffering from shortages, and investment from 
developed coastal regions to the relatively poorly developed 
power supply industries of the hinterlands. 
  Economically advanced regions will be encouraged to be 
self-reliant in terms of electricity by collecting funds 
themselves for investment in their own power sectors. 
  The MPI urges enterprises to create new channels of 
fund-raising and will permit them to apply to banks directly for 
loans and to other financial institutions for the issue of bonds 
and shares after seeking the approval from relevant government 
organs. 
  State Council officials said that China needs more foreign 
investment in the power industry to compensate for the shortfall. 
  The MPI will experiment with issuing bonds of enterprises 
abroad, and use the money collected to develop the power 
industry. 
  It will also permit some power sector enterprises, which 
have 
good economic returns, to issue shares overseas. And it will 
set up fund-raising companies abroad to help enterprises in the 
power industry to raise funds from international sources. 
  Because power supply is of great importance to the national 
economy, foreign investment in it will proceed under the State's 
macro-control. 
  Domestic investment should provide about 80 per cent of 
funding and the remainder will be sought from foreign investors. 
  To provide the public with reliable and quality service at 
reasonable prices, the MPI will continue to develop thermal 
power, hydro-electric power and limited amounts of nuclear power. 
  The MPI aims to harness the country's rivers to generate 
between 70 and 80 million kilowatts of hydropower by the turn of 
the century. 
  To achieve the goal, hydro-electric sites in the mainstream 
and tributaries of the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze 
River, the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the 
Lancangjiang and Honghe river valleys will be targeted. 
  The power industry will monitor experience in the 
construction and operational performance of the Qinshan and Daya 
Bay nuclear power stations. The two successful nuclear power 
stations in China will lay a good foundation for the development 
of nuclear power in China in the next century. 
  In terms of the operational mechanism of State-owned 
enterprises. modern corporate systems will be introduced. 
  State-owned enterprises will gradually be converted into 
limited companies and shareholding companies. 
  The standard shareholding system will ensure independence 
from government interference and create more channels for 
fund-raising. 
  To pave the way for the management reform of the industry 
the 
MPI has drafted the Electric Power Law. 
  Within three to five years, a comprehensive legal provision 
for the power industry, with the Electric Power Law as its 
centre, is expected to be established in China.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (CNS) -- Minister of Railways, Mr 
Han Zhubin, recently revealed that diversified business had 
become an important economic pillar of railway enterprises in 
China. 
  After more than ten years' development, railway enterprises 
in the country have developed their business from the mere 
railway industry to a dozen of industries including commerce, 
trade, tourism, food and catering, storage and construction. 
The diversified business has not only offered an economic 
backing to the construction and development of railways in the 
country, but also streamlined staff and workers in the railway 
sector, creating relaxed conditions for the reform of railway 
enterprises. 
  The diversified business of railway enterprises started in 
1984 and by the end of last year, there were over 7,000 
enterprises engaging in diversified business with employment of 
more than 380,000. Business income earned by them in 1993 made 
up nearly half of the total earned from railway shipment while 
their profits surpassed that from railway shipment. According 
to statistics, the diversified business income between 1986 and 
1993 was RMB [renminbi] 75.7 billion and some 218,000 staff and 
workers originally engaging in railway shipment had been 
transferred to enterprises specializing in other businesses. 
  The minister said that the goal set for the railway sector's 
diversified business in the next 6 years was to increase its 
business income and sales value as well as profits all by four 
times and streamline another hundreds of thousands of staff and 
workers from shipment enterprises to diversified business ones.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (CNS) -- According to a survey 
conducted by the Consumers Committee of the China Quality 
Management Association and the Beijing Shiqing Market 
Consultancy to 5,120 households in Beijing, Shanghai and 
Guangzhou, the three municipalities are now taking a lead in the 
country in terms of households' possession rate of colour TV 
sets, hi-fi sets, refrigerators, air conditioners, automatic 
washing machines, electric fans and water heaters. 
  The possession rate of colour TV sets by households in these 
cities has reached 97.4 percent, that of refrigerators 95.7 
percent, that of electric fans 90.7 percent and that of water 
heaters 58.7 percent. Such a possession rate of hi-fi sets is 
25.3 percent in Beijing, 23.8 percent in Shanghai and 45 percent 
in Guangzhou. Owing to the regional weather differences, the 
possession rate of air conditioners is 4.6 percent in Beijing, 
14.5 percent in Shanghai and 34.9 percent in Guangzhou, while 
the average rate of this machine in these three cities is 16.3 
percent.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Li Zhurun and Li Jun] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Trade unions, together 
with the government, are busy drafting laws on social insurance 
and labor safety that concern the "vital interests and rights of 
the 150 million Chinese workers," a union leader said today. 
  Li Qisheng, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions (ACFTU), told XINHUA that the ACFTU and the 
Ministry of Labor have finished drafting China's first labor 
law, which will be published this year after examination and 
approval by the National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  Li is leaving soon for Geneva to attend the 81st 
International Labor Conference, in his capacity as the 
representative of the Chinese workers. 
  "We safeguard workers' interests and rights by helping 
formulate legislation and reform programs, especially those 
concerning wages, employment, social insurance, medical care, 
housing and fringe benefits," he said. 
  "We see to it that laws, government decrees, policies and 
reform measures promote the welfare of the working masses as a 
whole, and that those affected are ensured of a livelihood," he 
said. 
  Li noted that since 1978 actual wages had seen an annual 
average increase of 5.9 percent. "The majority of the workers 
have benefited from the reforms and China's economic growth, and 
that's why they support the reforms and the ACFTU as the unified 
union organization in China," he said. 
  Beginning March 1, wage earners had their work hours cut 
from 
44 hours per week to 40, meaning that they now work five and a 
half days a week instead of six. Moreover, they are entitled to 
an annual vacation of about two weeks with full pay. 
  "The ACFTU was a key party in urging the government to 
institute such practices," he said. 
  Three union leaders are on the NPC Standing Committee, the 
supreme legislative body, and unionists are also leaders or 
members of groups charged by the State Council to formulate 
plans of reform measures that concern workers' everyday lives 
and benefits. 
  Moreover, the NPC and the State Council, as a rule, consult 
unions before publishing other laws or decrees. "In recent 
years, the ACFTU has contributed 2,000 proposals and ideas when 
laws and decrees were formulated or revised, and most of these 
were accepted," he said. 
  At a given enterprise, Li said, the employee is, for the 
first time, enjoying the right to collective bargaining or 
negotiation with the employer on matters ranging from wages and 
fringe benefits to labor safety. 
  "By law, the union, as the representative of the workers, 
discusses and signs the collective labor contract with the 
employer," he said. "Meanwhile, it co-operates with the 
employer in seeking development of the enterprise." 
  The union leader showed XINHUA several sample contracts, 
including one from the Beijing Jeep Company, a Sino-U.S. joint 
venture. 
  Under that contract the union chairman or his representative 
attend board meetings. The union must be consulted before the 
employer imposes new rules concerning employment, work hours, 
wages, fringe benefits, etc. 
  Workers may sign labor contracts individually, but the union 
sees to it that the terms must not be worse than those of the 
collective contract. Moreover, the unions supervise the 
implementation of individual labor contracts.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make a Key Breakthrough in Boosting </F>
Agriculture With Science and Technology"] 
  [Text] Since the Agricultural Work Conference held by the 
CPC Central Committee in March this year, various localities 
have energetically gone into action, seriously implemented 
relevant policies of the party, aroused in every possible way 
the peasants' enthusiasm, raised funds, gathered materials, 
increased input in agriculture, seized the time to do a good job 
in spring plowing and sowing and in field management, and 
strived to get a good harvest of summer crops and of crops of 
the whole year. 
  However, we should be aware that the task of developing 
agriculture remains quite arduous. In order to attain the goal 
of stabilizing grain output, increasing cotton output, and 
enriching the nonstaple food basket, it is necessary at present 
to stress once more the importance and urgency of depending on 
science and technology. 
  Last year, thanks to a series of measures adopted by the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council and the efforts of 
various quarters, a relatively good harvest was reaped in 
agriculture. While affirming achievements, we must be prepared 
against undesirable events and must soberly pay attention to 
severe challenges to agriculture in the future. The net annual 
increase in China's population is nearly 15 million. This means 
an annual increase of 6 million tonnes of grain can only 
maintain the existing level of grain per capita, and the 
increase in output since 1984 has all been consumed by the 
increase in the population. Farmland and other natural 
resources are decreasing day by day because of the development 
of infrastructure in towns and cities, such as transportation 
and the power industry. China's per capita area of farmland 
ranks third from the bottom among 26 countries with populations 
exceeding 50 million each. For quite a long time to come, these 
increasing and decreasing trends will remain irreversible. 
Also, in the course of becoming relatively well-off, people 
will set higher demands on the quantity and quality of food and 
industrial raw materials and, after reentry into GATT, there 
will be keen competition between the domestic and foreign 
markets. These are two facts which we have to face in the near 
future. The "irreversible" and "have to face" mentioned above 
will exert a tremendous pressure on agriculture, the primary 
industry, and we should not be blindly optimistic about the 
future. Moreover, in recent years, because of the enlarging 
price scissors of manufactured goods and agricultural produce, 
and the decreasing comparable benefits of agricultural 
production, those of growing grain and cotton in particular, the 
peasants' enthusiasm has not been great. 
  To a very great extent, this also has an adverse impact on 
the further development of agriculture. Therefore, to attain 
the goal of agricultural development in China in the 1990's, and 
to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chixu 
kuaisu jiankang fazhan] of the rural economy, we must, on the 
one hand, seriously and properly grasp the implementation of 
various rural policies of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council and, on the other hand, attach importance to the 
application of science and technology to agriculture, and 
develop the rural productive forces by means of the progress of 
science and technology in agriculture in a bid to ensure the 
effective supply of agricultural produce. 
  History since the founding of the people's republic shows 
that every step forward taken by agriculture and every upgrading 
of agriculture in China were inseparable from progress in 
science and technology. Let us recall what happed in the early 
and middle 1980's. The state increased input into agriculture, 
the peasants' enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high because of 
rural reforms, the peasants strived to apply the knowledge, 
technology, and research achievements accumulated for many years 
by science and technology personnel, and the best combination of 
various factors led to achievements in agriculture which 
attracted worldwide attention. In a short span of several 
years, the phenomenon of a serious shortage of agricultural 
produce resulting from the 10 years of turmoil was eradicated 
and various rationing coupons were abolished. Farmland 
accounting for only 7 percent of the world's total was able to 
support a population accounting for 22 percent of the world's 
total. The steady progress of urban reforms was also ensured. 
Such great achievements could not be separated from the 
application of science and technology to agriculture. 
"Depending first on policies and second on science and 
technology" was the simplest and most profound conclusion at 
that time. Historical experience is worthy of our serious 
attention. To attain the goal of a sustained and steady growth 
of agriculture and the rural economy, we still must stress the 
necessity of depending on progress in science and technology and 
on strengthening science and education to revitalize agriculture. 
  According to our national conditions, only by stressing 
focal points and making the targets clear for the input of 
science and technology, which is quite limited, can we achieve 
maximum economic, social, and ecological benefits. Let us take 
planting as an example. If an overall upgrading of species 
increases output by 10 percent, it will mean an increase in the 
output of grain of 45 million tonnes and of cotton of 400,000 
tonnes; if the utilization ratio of chemical fertilizer is 
raised by 10 percent, it will be equivalent to increasing the 
output of chemical fertilizer by 12 million tonnes; as bollworm 
was effectively prevented and controlled in the last few years, 
the peasants were able to increase their income by 6 billion 
yuan and the textile industry to increase its economic results 
by several times; and if 10 to 20 percent of straw is used to 
feed domestic animals and the manure of these animals is used to 
make the fields fertile, a large quantity of animal feed will be 
saved for breeding cows and sheep, the leather industry will be 
developed, and organic matter will be added to the soil. All 
the measures mentioned above will also be conducive to the 
protection of the ecological environment. The input of science 
and technology has the highest output rate. Therefore, while 
speeding up work to spread applicable scientific research 
results and advanced technology, the Ministry of Agriculture has 
decided to lay emphasis on spreading four items of agricultural 
technology -- properly grasping the system for selection, 
cultivation, and reproduction (including systems of improved 
varieties of seedlings, stock, poultry, and offspring) whose 
function is to provide good species; raising the utilization 
ratio of chemical fertilizer, mainly by applying the fertilizer 
at a deep level; comprehensive prevention and cure for animals 
and plants with the prevention and cure of "one worm and two 
diseases" as the focus; and regenerating abandoned agricultural 
resources by using straw to feed domestic animals and using the 
animals' manure to fertilize the fields. Also, the ministry has 
energetically worked to lay a foundation for science and 
technology, strengthened research in basic science with emphasis 
on key points, and strived to make major breakthroughs in 
scientific research in order to maintain the staying power of 
agricultural development. 
  To depend on progress in science and technology, we must 
attach importance to the use and training of qualified 
personnel. An important achievement in scientific research 
often requires the arduous exploration of science and technology 
personnel for 10 or even 20 years and the spreading of such an 
achievement over a large area again requires the hard work of 
tens of thousands of grassroots science and technology 
personnel. Leadership at all levels must adopt all necessary 
measures, attach importance to the building of the contingent 
for spreading science and technology at the grass-roots level 
and give full play to the role of the contingent, be good at 
absorbing science and technology personnel of institutions of 
higher learning to apply their advanced technology and research 
results to various projects for increasing investment benefits, 
make great efforts to support scientific research so that 
science and technology personnel will constantly score new 
achievements in their research, ensure the sustained growth of 
agriculture, show concern for the living and working conditions 
of science and technology workers, and dare to award those who 
have made outstanding contributions. In this respect, township 
and town enterprises and some enterprises using high and new 
technology, which have survived and developed amid acute market 
competition, have taken a step forward and have proved with 
their economic results and development that this strategic view 
is correct. We should attach importance to, and sum up, their 
experience. 
  At present, the people of the whole country are studying the 
Third Volume of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. 
We must seriously study a series of important instructions on 
agriculture, science, and technology given by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, and really understand the scientific conclusion that 
"science and technology is the primary productive force" and the 
guiding idea that in the final analysis, agriculture depends on 
science and technology to solve its problems. In this way, we 
shall be able to emancipate our minds, upgrade our concepts, 
adopt effective measures to strengthen science and technology 
work, really put the development of agriculture and the rural 
economy into the orbit of depending on progress in science and 
technology and improving the quality of laborers, ensure the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of agriculture and the 
entire national economy, and make due contributions to making 
the people of the whole country relatively well-off.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Having solved a series 
of technical problems, Chinese scientists have started to 
promote soilless cultivation of vegetables and crops across the 
whole country. 
  This was learned at the "International Seminar on Soilless 
Cultivation" held here last week. 
  Vegetables like tomatoes, aubergines, peppers and cucumbers 
raised in soilless hothouses have been supplied to markets all 
the year round in some provinces and cities. Rice is the main 
grain crop grown using this technique. 
  China's Agriculture Ministry began to research soilless 
cultivation in 1985, with more than 30 colleges and agricultural 
research institutes taking part in the project. 
  Vegetables grown this way have many advantages, such as 
saving water and fertilizer, high output, fine quality and 
resistance to pests. 
  Meanwhile, progress has been made in planting rice on water 
surfaces. Such rice in Zhejiang Province has an output of 7,500 
kg. per ha. 
  Soilless cultivation helps to makes good use of China's 
inland water resources and build them into grain production 
areas, which, it is hoped, will help China to solve the 
contradiction between population increase and the shrinkage of 
arable land. 
  If the technique were spread to China's current 
10-million-ha 
lake surfaces and 4.3-million-ha reservoir water surfaces, it 
would bring about great economic and social benefits, according 
to specialists. They predict that soilless cultivation will 
become the next trend in agricultural development in both China 
and other parts of the world.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 May (XINHUA) -- The structural 
contradiction of China's consumer goods market which was once 
quite conspicuous has diminished significantly since the 
beginning of the second quarter. Various locales have adopted 
effective measures to ensure sufficient funds for the 
procurement of agricultural and sideline products and to lessen 
peasants' burdens. As a result, the purchasing power of the 
vast number of peasants has increased to a certain extent, sales 
in rural markets have increased, and the gap between urban and 
rural markets has been further reduced. 
  From the second half of last year to early this year, there 
was a quite different situation in the rate of increase of sales 
in urban and rural markets. The rate of increase of sales in 
cities was far greater than that in the rural areas, and this 
extremely uneven situation has created a conspicuous structural 
contradiction in China's market situation. Some experts 
analyzed the situation and pointed out that this situation was 
mainly due to the fact that some locales have not earnestly 
implemented the policy of the party Central Committee on 
accelerating the development of agriculture, that the peasants' 
burdens were too heavy, and that the funds for procuring 
agricultural and sideline products were not appropriated 
promptly. The rate of increase in peasants' income was slow, 
and the extent of the increase of their purchasing power was 
relatively small. 
  Based on information from the State Statistical Bureau, 
since 
the beginning of this year's second quarter, various locales 
have strengthened measures to promote agricultural development 
and have achieved initial results. Peasants' income from 
selling agricultural and sideline products has increased to a 
certain extent, and their purchasing power has increased 
significantly. In April, the total volume of retail sales of 
consumer goods was 117.1 billion yuan. Of this amount, total 
retail sales of consumer goods in cities were 70.3 billion yuan, 
which was a 25.4-percent increase compared to the same period 
last year. Total retail sales of consumer goods in counties and 
lower levels were 46.8 billion yuan, an increase of 22.8 percent 
over the same period last year. The rate of increase of retails 
sales in rural areas in April was 1.8 percent higher than the 
previous month. The gap between the rate of the increase in 
sales of consumer goods between cities and rural areas was 
reduced from 5 percent in the first quarter to 2.6 percent. The 
extent of the increase in retail sales of consumer goods in 
counties and lower levels in Shandong, Hebei, Guangdong, Hunan, 
and Henan Provinces has even exceeded that of cities.

<F P=106> [By NONGMIN RIBAO reporter Sun Yongren (1327 3057 0088) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Hua Guiqin (5478 2710 0530)] 
  [Text] Nanchang, 27 May (XINHUA) -- "We should make the 
acceleration of the economic development of major grain and 
cotton production areas a systems engineering project, ensuring 
a steady increase of grain and cotton production, all-around 
development of the economy, and more income for farmers." This 
is the common understanding reached by economists attending a 
national seminar on the economic development of major grain and 
cotton production areas. 
  Over the years, for historical and many other reasons, 
China's major grain and cotton production areas have, on the one 
hand, provided large amounts of commercial grain and cotton to 
the whole country and made important contributions to the 
national economic development and improvement of the people's 
living standards; on the other hand, these areas have seen a low 
level of overall economic development, slow growth of local 
financial revenues, and comparatively low income for farmers. 
To properly resolve this outstanding problem in the Chinese 
rural economy, leaders, experts, and scholars from Heilongjiang, 
Jilin, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang Hunan, Hubei, 
Anhui, and Jiangxi -- the major grain and cotton production 
areas -- attended a seminar cosponsored by the State Council 
Research Office and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to discuss 
measures to promote grain and cotton production areas' economic 
development. Yuan Mu, director of the State Council Research 
Office, gave a keynote speech at the seminar. 
  The seminarians held: China has always attached great 
importance to grain and cotton production. The Central Rural 
Work Conference, convened last October, explicitly called for 
prioritizing support for major grain and cotton production 
areas' economic development. However, in the past we paid more 
attention to grain and cotton production within the context of 
promoting production, than to systemamtic study and solutions of 
questions related to these areas' all-around economic 
development. As a result, many areas faced the predicament of 
"major grain and cotton production counties having weak industry 
and being in financial straits," causing fluctuations in grain 
and cotton markets. A summary of historical experiences and 
lessons shows that we should make the promotion of major grain 
and cotton areas' economic development a systems engineering 
project. This is a new strategic concept for solving problems 
related to grain and cotton production under the condition of a 
socialist market economy, about which leaders at all levels and 
relevant departments should reach a common understanding. 
  In line with this new concept for major grain and cotton 
production areas' economic development, the seminarians 
suggested that attention be paid to identifying and solving 
problems related to the following 10 issues: Defining a 
comprehensive and correct economic development goal for the 
major grain and cotton production areas by shifting from the 
previous simple mode of grain and cotton farming to the 
establishment of a comprehensive goal that organically combines 
steady growth of grain and cotton production with all-around 
economic development and a rapid increase of farmers' incomes; 
making agricultural modernization the foundation of economic 
development, with the emphasis on extensive popularization and 
application of science and technology to revitalize agriculture; 
bringing into better play the areas' advantages in grain and 
cotton production as they form the foundation and pillar as well 
as provide the source for steady growth of farmers' incomes in 
these areas; continuously readjusting and optimizing these 
areas' production structures, ensuring a stable growth in the 
total grain and cotton output while actively developing 
diversified management and nonagricultural undertakings; 
transferring surplus laborers from these areas through various 
channels and strengthening efforts to organize, guide, and 
manage such transfer; gradually introducing large-scale 
operations to these areas and, first of all, utilizing these 
areas' advantages in grain and cotton production by promoting 
large-scale comprehensive agricultural development projects; 
establishing a pricing system conducive to a stable increase of 
grain and cotton output and in line with the principle of 
production cost plus reasonable profit; establishing a new 
system for grain and cotton procurement and market in keeping 
with a market economy; establishing fair and reasonable 
relations of interests between grain and cotton producing and 
marketing areas; and adopting effective goverment preferential 
policies toward major grain and cotton production areas, mainly 
in terms of providing funds, loans, major scientific and 
technological projects, the pattern of processing industries, 
and foreign trade exports.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "State Puts More Money Into Farm </F>
Production"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government is set to pour more money 
into agriculture this year to boost grain and cotton output, 
according to official sources. 
  More investment will be channeled to leading grain and 
cotton-producing areas and the less developed central and 
western regions, said Wang Xinjian, an official from the State 
Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development Programme 
(CADP), yesterday. 
  The government has decided to pour 1.9 billion yuan ($219 
million) into CADP projects, including grain and cotton 
development. This figure is 200 million yuan ($23 million) more 
than last year, according to Wang. 
  But the official did not reveal how much of this money would 
be used for grain and cotton development projects. 
  The central government will also set aside another 1 billion 
yuan ($115 million) as special fund to provide work for the 
poverty stricken population from this year to 2000, said the 
official. 
  A total of 25 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) has been injected 
into the programme from the central and local governments and 
other sector since the programme was launched six years ago. 
  Seventy-five per cent of the fund was used for developing 
facilities aimed at bolstering the production of grain, cotton 
and edible oil, 15 per cent for meat, eggs and aquatic products, 
and 10 percent for forest and grassland construction. 
  Most of the fund was used for infrastructure construction 
for 
agricultural production, while the rest has been poured into 
biological development projects and scientific and technological 
promotions, said Wang. 
  The development of low- or medium-yield farmland into 
high-yield plots is the most important part of the programme. 
Usually the per-unit yield would double after the land is 
improved. 
  A total of 8 million hectares of low- or medium-yield 
farmland has been transformed since 1988 and 1 million hectares 
of wasteland have been reclaimed. 
  In addition, 1.2 million hectares of new forest farms have 
been planted and 350,000 hectares of grassland improved. 
  These efforts have turned out an additional 18 billion kg of 
grain, 252 million kg of cotton, 700,000 tons of edible oil, 10 
million kg of sugar, and 650,000 tons of meat during the last 
six years. 
  The country inaugurated the CADP projects in 1988 by 
concentrating massive investment on selected agricultural areas 
and projects in a bid to tackle rural problems comprehensively. 
  The thrust of the projects is the attempt to increase 
production of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar, while 
ensuring an all-round, coordinated development of farming, 
forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fishery. 
  The first batch of the programme covered 10 provinces and 
autonomous regions, including the Three-River 
(Heilong-Wusuli-Songhua rivers) Plain in Northeast China, plains 
along the Yellow River, Huaihe River, and Haihe River, and the 
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

  [Text] Chongqing, May 31 (CNS) -- According to the Foreign 
Economic and Trade Commission of Chongqing City in Sichuan 
Province, with expansion of the foreign investment size and 
widening of realm of such investment, foreign capital is playing 
an increasingly important role in promoting the development of 
Chongqing's economy. 
  Statistics have showed that there are 1,613 items utilizing 
foreign capital in the City with the contracted foreign capital 
of US$2.49 billion in the past ten or more years. The City has 
also had 1,316 three-type foreign-funded enterprises with the 
contracted foreign capital of US$1.29 billion. By the end of 
last year, foreign investment in fixed assets in the City has 
made up 15 percent of the total investment put in state-owned 
and collectively-owned enterprises, indicating that foreign 
capital has become an important source of fund-raising for 
economic construction of the City. In addition, the city has 
also gained from foreign-funded enterprises an increasing amount 
of tax revenue, which was as high as RMB 140 million [renminbi] 
last year. 
  In recent years, the City has introduced US$700 million for 
construction of basic industries and the urban infrastructure 
such as transport and telecommunications with some key programs 
like a large-scale thermal power plant, 250 000 
program-controlled telephones and a bridge over the Yangtze 
River having been completed. 
  The three-type foreign-funded enterprises have become an 
important force in the City's foreign trade sector with their 
import and export value increasing a lot every year. The export 
value of such enterprises of the City was US$22.27 million in 
1992 and the value increased to US$54.60 million last year with 
the exports involving 30 categories such as automobiles, 
electronic products, medicine and garments. 
  The city is planning to adopt more flexible ways to 
introduce 
foreign capital and has set US$3.5 billion as its target for 
utilization of the contracted foreign capital by the end of this 
century.

  [Text] Chengdu, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province has been engaged in popularizing agricultural 
science and technology and has consequently reaped bumper 
harvests over the past few years. 
  According to statistics from the agricultural department of 
the province, grain output increased by 1.3 billion kg and the 
farmers obtained a total extra income of 588 million yuan last 
year by utilizing the new technologies and techniques. 
  As the major pork production base of the country, the 
province has spread scientific pig-raising techniques. Animal 
husbandry in the province has been developing for 17 years 
running. 
  The province produced 4.l49 million tons of pork last year, 
3.33 percent more than in 1992. 
  From the beginning of this year, the provincial committee of 
science and technology, the provincial agricultural academy, 
Southwest China Agriculture University in the province and 
Sichuan Agriculture University have sent 100 scientists and 
technicians to grassroots units to contract a total area of 
10,000 mu (about 666 hectares) to set examples of high-yield 
farmlands for the local peasants. 
  Since 1990, governmental organs also sent more than 2,200 
officials to comparatively backward counties to help residents 
to shake off poverty. 
  Thousands of technicians from large enterprises work in 
township enterprises to help them develop products and seek 
markets.

  [Text] Chengdu, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province, the largest pork producer in China, marketed 
18.1 million head of pigs in the first three months of this year. 
  Making up one third of the total pork output of the country, 
Sichuan supplied other provinces with about one million tons of 
pork last year. 
  As pig raising is profitable, more and more farmers are 
taking to it. At present, more than 60 percent of the local 
farmers' cash revenue comes from sales of pigs. 
  Meanwhile, the local government has drawn up favorable 
policies to encourage the farmers to raise more pigs and 
popularize new technology in this field. Twenty counties have 
been chosen to be built into lean pork export bases. 
  The province is also paying attention to pork processing and 
trading in a bid to improve economic efficiency.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 KYODO -- Armed police beat and 
rounded up some 40 Tibetan merchants who demonstrated against a 
tax hike in the Tibetan city of Lhasa, informed sources said 
Friday [27 May]. 
  The policemen also confiscated the camera, films and 
passports of four foreign travellers, including American 
tourists, who photographed the scene of the clampdown, the 
sources said. 
  The police charged the Tibetans as they shouted such slogans 
as "we oppose a tax increase" in front of the local 
administration office, according to foreign travellers who 
witnessed the beatings. 
  A column of some 100 armed policemen blockaded roads leading 
up to the scene of the brawl for a few hours, they said. 
  The latest clampdown followed the arrest of a Tibetan 
Buddhist priest who demanded independence from Chinese rule on 
April 24.

<F P=106> [From Robbie Barnett in Lhasa] </F>
  [Text] Chinese police are alleged to have beaten 
demonstrators and arrested five Tibetans when shopkeepers staged 
a protest in Lhasa, according to sources in the city. Up to 200 
Tibetans joined a crowd in the Tibetan capital on Friday [27 
May] protesting against tax increases. The demonstrators were 
rallying against recent increases of more than 20 per cent in 
taxes on shopkeepers. 
  But the incident, which fell close to two sensitive 
anniversaries, could have a concealed political agenda. Last 
Monday marked the 33rd anniversary of the Tibetans' formal 
surrender to the Chinese in the "17 Point Agreement" of 1951, 
and Tuesday was the anniversary of a major protest in 1993 which 
began as a complaint about prices but turned into a 
pro-independence rally. 
  Friday's protest began around 2 pm when traders in the 
Barkor, the main shopping street in the Tibetan quarter of the 
city, closed their shops, apparently in protest at the tax 
increase. Between 100 and 200 people gathered in front of the 
offices of the Lhasa "Chengguanqu", the inner city government, 
in Dekyi Shar Lam (Beijing Dong Lu), and shouted slogans against 
taxation. The protesters were joined by about 100 onlookers who 
also began shouting, one report said. 
  At about 5 pm riot police carrying shields marked "gong an" 
(police) took up positions along Dekyi Lam and sealed off the 
area around the inner city government offices. A number of 
demonstrators were beaten and five people were believed to have 
been arrested, according to an unconfirmed report. A platoon of 
armed police was moved by truck into the area at around 7.30 pm, 
by which time the crowd had dispersed. Police confiscated the 
passports of three tourists staying at the Banakshol Hotel, 
opposite the government offices, who had witnessed the protest. 
Watching disturbances is illegal for foreigners in Tibet, 
according to local laws. 
  This is the second incident to have been reported in Lhasa 
in 
the past week. Last Tuesday, four monks were said to have been 
arrested after they began a pro-independence protest near the 
Jokhang Temple in the Barkor area, according to a report 
yesterday by the KYODO News Agency in Tokyo, citing unnamed 
foreign tourists. The four monks were detained by police after 
shouting pro-independence slogans, and some of the monks were 
knocked to the ground by the police before being led away. 
  Meanwhile in neighbouring Nepal, fears that Tibetans might 
demonstrate to mark the anniversary of the "17 Point Agreement" 
led to a wave of random arrests of Tibetans in Kathmandu. In a 
well co-ordinated security operation, an estimated 70 Tibetans 
were imprisoned for eight hours in police quarters in the 
Nepalese capital, according to one detainee. "We were held from 
10 in the morning until six o'clock that evening. We had no 
food or water and were escorted by police even to go to the 
toilet," said the detainee, who had been picked up by police for 
no apparent reason while he was on his way to collect a visa 
from the Chinese' Embassy in Kathmandu.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by staff correspondent Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F>
1627): "New Policies on Tibet Being Drawn Up by the Central 
High-Level Authorities Attempt To Promote the Region's Economy 
With Preferential Treatment"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29th--An authoritative figure here has 
revealed that decisionmakers at the highest level in the central 
authorities are stepping up efforts to come to a decision to 
develop and open the Tibet Autonomous Region, which represents 
one eighth of China, and to pursue a policy there which is even 
more open than those in all the special economic zones and 
Shanghai's Pudong. The idea is to promote Tibet's economy with 
massive and large doses of preferential policies, so that the 
region can be incorporated in the country's modernization effort 
and launched on the fast track of development as soon as 
possible. 
  This person said that, over the last 40 years, the central 
authorities have pumped tens of billions of yuan into Tibet and 
have actively supported and assisted its economic development, 
regarding it as a matter of great importance. The highest 
levels are currently conducting a comprehensive review of their 
rule over Tibet and the successes and failures of their policy, 
comparing the region's economic development with that of its 
neighbors, and studying the experiences gained over the last few 
years in border opening. The central authorities believe that 
Tibet is now ready to be opened to the outside world, 
particularly southern Asia, and has the right conditions for 
being incorporated in the country's modernization effort. In 
view of its geographic and various unique features, the central 
authorities have decided to jump start Tibet's economy with 
massive doses of preferential policies. The authoritative 
person said that Tibet's unique position among the country's 
provinces, cities, and autonomous regions means that the special 
policy to be pursued toward Tibet will not be applicable to 
other minority nationality autonomous regions. 
  It is understood that the special preferential policy for 
Tibet, which the highest levels in the central authorities are 
working on, is only at the discussion stage. It is not known 
when it will be unveiled, and there have not been any 
disclosures of detailed procedures for the policy. However, the 
authoritative figure was certain that the central preferential 
polices to be granted to Tibet will be much more favorable than 
those for the five special economic zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, 
Xiamen, Shantou, and Hainan and Shanghai's Pudong.

<F P=106> ["Second Session of Sixth Autonomous Regional People's </F>
Congress Opens Ceremoniously"] 
  [Text] The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress opened ceremoniously as the majestic 
"National Anthem of the People's Republic of China" was played 
in the Hall of Tibetan People on the morning of 15 May. 
  Under the stately national emblem, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu 
said in a report delivered by him on behalf of the autonomous 
regional people's government: In 1993, the governments at 
various levels worked under the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, firmly implemented the party's basic line, 
seriously carried out the guidelines of the Fourth Enlarged 
Plenary Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee 
and the First Session of the Sixth Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress, and adhered to the principle of fostering both 
material progress and cultural and ideological progress. They 
took economic construction as the central task, deepened reforms 
for the purpose of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, and promoted the development of productive forces. 
The region's gross domestic product was 3.65 billion yuan, up 
8.1 percent from 1992. New achievements were reached on all 
fronts. 
  At 0930 hours, 368 deputies present at the meeting heard the 
government work report and applauded it frequently and warmly. 
During the session, the deputies will examine and discuss the 
report and adopt a resolution on it. 
  Raidi, executive chairman of both the session and its 
presidium, presided over the opening ceremony. Other executive 
chairmen of the session and its presidium were seated in the 
front row on the rostrum. They were Puqung, Zheng Ying, Pudoje, 
Namgyai, Sangding Duojipamu Deqinquzhen, Gong Daxi, Tian Fujun, 
Baima Duoji, Yongzhong Zhawa, and Cui Jiguo. Pagbalha Geleg 
Namgyai, vice chairman of the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee, attended the meeting and was seated on the 
rostrum. Also seated on the rostrum were leaders of the party, 
government and army organizations in the autonomous region, 
including Chen Kuiyuan, Gyaincain Norbu, Basang, Hu Yongzhu, Zi 
Cheng, Lieque, Buqiong, Lu Huimin, Jiang Cuo, Jipu 
Pingcuocideng, Labapingcuo, Toinzhub, Yang Song, Luosang 
Toinzhub, Luosang Danzeng, Jangzhong Zhaxi Doje, Lhamin Soinam 
Lhunzhub, Jimzhong Gyaincain Puncog, Lhalu Cewang Doje, Tangmai

Duojizha Renzengqinmo Jiangbailuosang, Yabxi Wangdui, Qiazha 
Qiangbachilai, Zhou Qishun, Yang Chaoji, Zhou Wenbi, Jiang 
Guangcheng, and Zhang Zhu, as well as the president of the 
autonomous regional higher people's court Bai Zhao and the 
person in charge of the autonomous regional people's 
procuratorate. 
  In the 18,000-character-strong "report," Gyaincain Norbu 
first recalled the work of the past year. He said: We steadily 
developed the rural and pastoral economy, industrial production, 
and transport. The construction of energy, transport, 
telecommunications, and other infrastructural projects proceeded 
smoothly. A good trend of development was maintained in foreign 
trade and tourism, and in the work of introducing investments 
from abroad and establishing lateral ties at home. New progress 
was made in establishing the market system, new achievements 
were made in the building of spiritual civilization, and the 
people's living standards were further improved. 
  The "report" expounded in detail the salient features of 
1993, including efforts to emancipate the mind, deepen reforms, 
improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, 
adhere to the principle of fostering both material progress and 
cultural and ideological progress and attaching equal importance 
to both, achieve social stability, and wage a thorough 
anti-corruption struggle. 
  Making a comprehensive analysis and summing up achievements, 
Gyaincain Norbu pointed out: There are still many shortcomings 
in our work, as well as many difficulties and problems ahead. 
We must pay great attention to solving them seriously. 
  On the guiding principle and tasks for this year, Gyaincain 
Norbu particularly pointed out: Nineteen-ninety-four is a 
crucial year for this region to carry out comprehensive reforms, 
promote overall progress, make breakthroughs in selected fields, 
and accelerate the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure. For this reason, the guiding principle for 
the government work is: to work under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line; implement in an 
all-around way the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Fifth Enlarged Plenary 
Session of the Fourth Autonomous Regional CPC Committee; seize 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development 
and maintain statability; continue to improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control, step up infrastructural construction, 
vigorously readjust the economic structure, and constantly 
enhance economic efficiency; and bring about a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development. The goal of economic 
development is to achieve a gross domestic product of 4.01 
billion yuan, an 8 percent increase over 1993. 
  Gyaincain Norbu emphasized: All our work this year should 
be subordinate to and serve the main objective -- reform, 
development, and stability -- and reform should be put at the 
center of all our undertakings. In economic restructuring, we 
should take productive forces as the criterion and seize the 
opportunity to promote overall progress and strive to make 
breakthroughs in selected fields. Our economic restructuring 
should converge with the national framework and structure. In 
economic restructuring, we should consider Tibet's reality, take 
firm action and prudent steps, and adopt flexible policies. 
Gyaincain Norbu called on the governments at various levels to 
implement meticulously all promulgated reform measures and do 
solid work in all fields. 
  In order to adhere to the guiding principle and accomplish 
all tasks of this region this year, Gyaincain Norbu pointed out: 
Efforts should be made to increase the income of peasants and 
herdsmen, further deepen reforms in rural and pastoral areas, 
increase investment in agriculture and animal husbandry, 
readjust structure according to market demand, develop village 
and town enterprises and a diversified economy, and accelerate 
economic development in rural and pastoral areas. It is 
necessary to step up infrastructural construction and enhance 
the capacity for future economic growth. It is necessary to 
concentrate on improving the economic efficiency of industry and 
transport service. A further step should be taken to open up 
wider to the outside world and to develop foreign trade and 
tourism. We should continue to improve the fiscal, taxation, 
and banking work and ensure funds for economic and social 
development. We should accelerate the construction of markets 
and cultivate a unified, open market system. Great efforts 
should be made to develop education, science and technology, and 
improve the quality of the work force. It is necessary to 
improve the social security system and accelerate the reform of 
the urban housing system. 
  Gyaincain Norbu said: Development is the foundation for 
social stability, and reform creates a strong motive force for 
development. Only when social stability is maintained can we 
smoothly promote reform, opening up, and economic development. 
He emphasized: We should correctly handle the relationship 
among reform, development, and stability and create favorable 
conditions and a good social environment for the deepening of 
reforms and for the acceleration of development. Gyaincain 
Norbu expounded in detail such questions as how to wage a 
thorough anti-splittist struggle, strengthen the political power 
at the grass-roots level, do good work concerning nationalities 
and religions in the new period, strengthen the legal system, 
step up the building of spiritual civilization, and deepen the 
anti-corruption struggle. 
  In conclusion, Gyaincain Norbu called on everyone in Tibet 
to 
rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin at its core, hold aloft the banner of building a 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, unite as one, work hard, 
create a new situation of reform, development, and stability in 
Tibet, and rapidly bring about new development in all 
undertakings in Tibet. 
  Present at the meeting as non-voting attendees were all the 
delegates to the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference; comrades in charge of various 
departments, bureaus, commissions, and offices of the autonomous 
region; responsible persons of various Tibet offices in interior 
and coastal regions; responsible persons of universities and 
colleges; responsible persons of various organs directly under 
the central authorities; and responsible persons of various 
prefectures (cities) and counties.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Rengui (6392 0088 6311): "People's </F>
Congress Deputies Discuss in Groups the `Government Work 
Report'; Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, and Gyaincain Norbu Participate in 
Discussions"] 
  [Text] Reform, development, and stability became the focal 
points of heated discussions by deputies during the second 
session of the sixth regional people's congress. Yesterday, 
deputies began discussing in groups the "Government Work Report" 
delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu. 
  Deputies Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, and Gyaincain Norbu arrived at 
the conference center early in the morning [of 16 May]. They 
participated in discussions and attentively listened to other 
deputies' speeches. 
  At a group discussion held by the Lhasa city delegation, 
when 
the delegation convener invited Comrade Chen Kuiyuan to take the 
floor, the latter said laughingly: "I am just an ordinary 
deputy. Let everyone express his or her views." At group 
discussions of the Nagqu and Xigaze delegations, Comrades Raidi 
and Gyaincain Norbu attentively listened to the deputies' views 
on the "Report," added remarks during the deputies' speech from 
time to time, and earnestly took notes. When reporters were 
present as visitors at group discussions of Nyingchi, Qamdo, 
Ngari, Shannan, and People's Liberation Army delegations, they 
noticed deputies of these delegations unanimously maintained 
that the 20-character principle -- "Seize the Opportunity, 
Deepen Reform, Open Up Wider, Promote Development, and Maintain 
Stability" -- decided upon by the central authorities had been 
conscientiously implemented and had produced concrete results in 
Tibet. It was also embodied in the entire "Report." Deputy 
Kong Qinghua, from Maizhokunggar County said: It is a realistic 
"report" without any exaggerations or empty words, and has a 
high possibility of being put into operation. 
  Deputy Caiwang Bandian, of Xigaze Prefecture, explained the 
economic development and stability enjoyed by Tibet as a result 
of reform and opening up and in light of Xigaze's actual 
conditions. He deeply felt that 1994 is, indeed, a very crucial 
year. He said: The "Report" affirmed the main aspects, and 
found out the problems that Tibet needs to solve badly. It has 
new ideas and proposes many measures. The crux of the matter 
lies in implementation. 
  Deputies believed we must focus attention on improving 
peasants' and herdsmen's income in our endeavor to promote 
economic development at agricultural and pastoral areas. The 
"Report's" plan in this respect conforms to Tibetan realities. 
The crux of the matter lies in doing a good job of propaganda 
and explanation to win the understanding and support of the 
masses as well as their participation. The establishment of a 
market system, enterprises' "transformation of operating 
mechanisms," education, trained personnel, exploitation of 
resources, grain circulation, and foreign trade were also hot 
points of deputies' discussions. 
  The special importance of stability in Tibet was a topic to 
which deputies paid very close attention. They believed the 
third part of the "Report" offered a clear, definite, and 
specific explanation on how to create a favorable social 
environment to ensure the smooth progress of reform and 
development. Deputies suggested that emphasis be laid on the 
grass roots when carrying out the work of maintaining stability, 
and that all problems be resolutely addressed in the bud while 
efforts are made to do a good job of propaganda and guidance.

  [Text] The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress held its second plenary meeting 
yesterday afternoon at the Tibet People's Hall. 
  Deputies attending the meeting heard a report by Wu 
Shunxiang, deputy chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional 
Planning and Economic Commission, on the execution of Tibet's 
1993 economic and social development plan and on the autonomous 
region's draft economic and social development plan for 1994. 
They also heard a report by Pingcuo, director of the Tibet 
Autonomous Regional Finance Department, on Tibet's final 
financial account of 1993 and on its draft financial budget for 
1994. 
  Puqung, executive chairman of the meeting and the presidium, 
presided over the meeting. 
  Other executive chairmen of the meeting were Chen Kuiyuan, 
Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Luosang Toinzhub, Jiang Chengguang, Ma 
Guanghua, Gao Shizhen, Zheng Guangju, Zhan Dui, Ni Zhicheng, 
Baima Ciren, Chilai, Wang Xiaoruo, Luosang Xinba, Cidian Lamu, 
Yixi Danzeng, Lu Sheng, Liao Jikang, Sangzhub, and Xiangba 
Pingcuo. 
  Wu Shunxiang, who was entrusted by the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional Government to make the report, said in his report: 
Tibet continued to adhere to the reform and opening up policy 
in 1993 and the region's economic and social development 
maintained at a considerable speed last year. Over the past 
year, under the leadership of the regional CPC Committee and 
government, following the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
remarks made during his south China tour, centering on economic 
construction, and proceeding from reform, people of all 
nationalities in Tibet emancipated their minds and changed the 
conventional way of thinking, enabling Tibet to take a new step 
forward in carrying out reform and opening up -- its production 
and construction developed rapidly and in a steady and sustained 
manner; and work in the science and technology, education, and 
other social sectors developed in a coordinated manner. The 
region's 1993 gross product, calculated using current prices, 
reached 3.65 billion yuan -- in terms of comparable prices, this 
represents an 8.1-percent increase over the previous year, which 
was higher than the planned growth of 8 percent. With the 
public ownership system as the pillar, a diversified economic 
setup in which simultaneous development was made in all economic 
sectors began to take shape. The market was brisk, the economy 
prospered, and the people's livelihood continued to improve. 
  To completely fulfill the 1994 plan, the report stressed 
that 
work in few important areas must be properly carried out. They 
are: First, we should do everything we can to increase incomes 
of the masses of peasants and herdsmen; second, we should ensure 
that reform of state-owned enterprises is properly carried out; 
third, we should endeavor to develop the market; fourth, we 
should strictly control price increases; fifth, we should make 
positive efforts to reform the workers pension system and the 
unemployment insurance system; sixth, we should deepen reform of 
the fixed asset investment system and further improve the 
management of capital construction projects. 
  Based on an overall analysis of last year's economic 
performance, Wu Shunxiang pointed out in his report: In 1994, 
Tibet's economy can still maintain a good growth trend. As long 
as we do our work well in all areas, we will be able to develop 
the economy in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, as 
required by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu in his government work 
report. 
  Pingcuo, who was entrusted by the autonomous regional 
government to make the report, said in his report: Following 
the more than 100 million yuan in financial revenue in 1992, 
Tibet's financial revenue further increased in 1993 -- reaching 
156 million yuan, a 43.5-percent increase over the previous 
year, which was higher than the region's gross product growth. 
Financial expenditures in 1993 was 2.16012 million yuan, a net 
increase of 494,820 yuan -- or 30 percent -- over the 1992 final 
account value. Both the absolute amount of increase in 
expenditure and the increase percentage were the highest in 
recent years. The guiding thoughts for the preparation of the 
1994 budget are: to ensure the supply of daily necessities for 
the people; to ensure that reform can be carried out smoothly; 
to support construction; while ensuring funds for wages and 
basic public expenditures, to smoothly promote financial, 
taxation, and other major economic reforms; to strive to open up 
new financial sources and to increase revenues; to adjust the 
expenditure structure -- supporting selected agricultural, 
animal husbandry, science and technology, and educational 
projects and to the construction of infrastructural facilities; 
and sharply reducing general consumption expenditures to ensure 
that the economy develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
manner and to maintain social stability. 
  Tibet's party, government, and military leaders attended 
yesterday's meeting. All members attending the Second Session 
of the Sixth Tibet Regional Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference attended the meeting as 
observers. 
  Yesterday's meeting should have been attended by 448 
deputies; 358 deputies, meeting the quorum, attended the meeting.

  [Excerpt] The central government has in the past 40 years 
invested a total of 20 billion yuan in the Tibet Autonomous 
Region, establishing there a situation of economic development, 
stability, ethnic solidarity, and social progress. In 1993, 
Tibet's GDP was 3.05 billion yuan, its peasants' per-capita 
income 521 yuan, and there was relatively rapid development in 
the region's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, 
infrastructure, and foreign trade. 
  Gyaincain Norbu, Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Government chairman, said at the National People's Congress 
session in mid-May: "1994 has been a critical year for our 
region in that it has seen comprehensive reforms, wholesale 
progress, key breakthroughs, and stepped-up efforts at creating 
a socialist market economic system." Regarding reforms, "efforts 
are under way to install a mechanism for the transfer of user's 
rights to land and pasture with compensation" and to encourage 
peasants and herdsmen to open up wasteland by "granting the 
operating rights to whoever opens up the land"; and 
manufacturing enterprises are transforming their operating 
mechanisms and rationalizing their business organization. 
Regarding opening up, Tibet has been exploiting its proximity 
to the border. It is improving its border ports, initiating 
cooperation with neighboring countries in many areas, improving 
the investment environment to attract more foreign and domestic 
investment, cooperating further with enterprises from the rest 
of the country to build more joint export bases, developing 
tourism, and so on.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 27 May, the Tibetan People's 
Armed Forces Committee, the Tibetan Military District [TMD], and 
the regional party committee's Propaganda Department jointly 
held a forum in Lhasa to mark the 10th anniversary of the 
promulgation of the present Military Service Law. Regional 
party, government, and military leaders Raidi, Puqung, (Cui 
Jiguo), Laba Pingcuo, Luosang Toinzhub, Zhou Wenbi, Hu Yongzhu, 
Gama Cedain, Jiang Chengguang, and concerned leaders from 
various regional departments and bureaus attended the forum. 
  Regional Vice Chairman Laba Pingcuo addressed the forum. He 
said: Since the present Military Service Law was promulgated 10 
years ago, party and government organizations at all levels 
across the region have been carrying out the propaganda and 
implementation of the law as a strategic task for improving the 
understanding of national defense among the masses of all 
nationalities in the region and enhancing their awareness of the 
need for national defense, and have been taking the support for 
national defense and army building as an important element in 
stabilizing the situation and developing the economy. They gave 
full support to military families accompanying the troops, 
helping them to get jobs and education for their children. Over 
the past decade, the vast number of cadres and the masses -- 
after acquainting themselves with the basic guidelines of the 
Military Service Law -- enhanced their understanding of national 
defense and of the great significance of strengthening army 
building and national defense and inspired youngsters' patriotic 
zeal and enthusiasm in supporting and joining the Army, bringing 
about a favorable general mood in society to support and show 
concern for national defense building and to support, cherish, 
and honor the people's own Army. 
  TMD Commander Zhou Wenbi and leaders from the regional party 
committee Propaganda Department, the regional justice 
department, and other relevant units also spoke at the forum.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ning Shiqun (1337 0013 5028)] </F>
  [Text] Lhasa, 30 May (XINHUA) -- The party Central 
Committee and the State Council have attached great importance 
to infrastructure construction in Tibet. Over the past decade, 
large sums of money have been invested in the region and 
significant achievements have been made in the development of 
energy sources, transportation, communications, irrigation, 
education, and other infrastructure construction projects. 
  Tibet has scored significant results in building energy 
sources. As of end of 1993, the total capacity of electric power 
stations reached 173,400 kw, capable of generating 399 million 
kwh of electricity. Now 79 percent of counties and cities and 
32 percent of townships are being served with electricity. The 
construction of the state invested Yangzhuoyong Lake pumping and 
power generating station, which has a capacity of 112,500 kw is 
being stepped up. The first phase project for the Nagqu 
underground heat experimental power station, which is a 
sino-foreign joint venture, has been completed and put into 
operation. China's current largest underground heat 
experimental power station--the Yangbajing Underground Heat 
Power Station--with a capacity of 24,000 kw has also been put 
into operation. Construction of power stations in the 19 
counties which so far have no electric power is being 
accelerated. 
  The construction of transportation projects in Tibet is 
being 
stepped up. As of now, the total length of highways reaches 
22,000 kms. A highway network with Lhasa as the center has been 
formed in the main, and highways now lead to every county in the 
region. 
  Tibet's posts and telecommunications facilities have been 
greatly improved. As of the end of 1993, there were 125 post 
and telecommunications bureaus and offices, and 24 earth 
communications stations [tong xin di qiu zhan 6639 0207 0966 
3808 4541] had been built. There are 301 long distance 
telephone lines, and 65 counties and cities now have telephone 
service with a total of 35,400 telephones. A postal and 
telecommunications network with Lhasa as the center has been 
formed. In 1993, the total volume of postal and 
telecommunications business reached 32.73 million yuan. In the 
past decade, the average annual growth volume of operation of 
postal and telecommunications services was 16.8 percent. 
  Capital construction for agricultural production and animal 
husbandry in Tibet has been further strengthened. As of the end 
of 1993, more than 20,000 irrigation projects of various sizes 
have been built. There are 174 water diversion projects and 
5,075 small water reservoirs and ponds with a total storage 
capacity of 350 million cubic meters. There are 129 pumping 
stations, 174 drinking water projects for people and animals, 
and 21 dike projects with a total length of 252 kms. The total 
irrigated area for farmland reached more than 1 million mu, 
accounting for 30 percent of arable land. The total irrigated 
area of grassland reached more than 30 million mu, and 4.25 
million mu of grassland have been fenced. The comprehensive 
development for "one river and two streams" has achieved initial 
results. The construction of grassland, fences, and disaster 
prevention bases for livestock has produced benefits. Scientific 
and technological services for agricultural production and 
animal husbandry have also made new progress. 
  The strategy of giving priority to developing education in 
Tibet has been implemented. Over the past decade, Tibet has set 
up a new university, two new technical secondary schools, 13 new 
middle schools, and 775 new primary schools. At present, the 
total enrollment of students exceeds 245,000, and 63.2 percent 
of school-age children in the region are attending school.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China is putting final 
touches to a 14-year-long, tremendous project to renovate 
monasteries throughout the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  According to Zhou Dunyou, official in charge of the region's 
nationality and religious affairs, the project, started in 1980 
and consuming more than 260 million yuan from the central 
government and Tibet regional government, has given a new image 
to over 1,400 monasteries. 
  Of these, 553 were seriously damaged during the Cultural 
Revolution (1966-76). 
  Zhou said that the renovation campaign has covered a wide 
range of lamaseries and temples. 
  The cost of renovating the Potala Palace in Lhasa alone, 
which will be completed in August, has totalled 50 million yuan. 
  Dealing with a crack in the wall of the Johkang Temple in 
Lhasa has cost the central government three million yuan. 
  About 66 million yuan and 600 kg of gold went to build a 
stupa (shrine) and memorial hall for the late 10th Panchen Lama, 
who died in 1989. 
  Zhou noted that the central government and the regional 
government are now concentrating on helping the monasteries have 
enough funds to support themselves. 
  Lamas in the Tibet region have been encouraged to take up 
some subsidiary business to raise funds for the monasteries' 
everyday expenditure. 
  "The move is going with the tide the of market economy," 
Zhou 
said. 
  Over 90 percent of all the 1,400-plus lamaseries and temples 
in the region still live on alms given by religious followers. 
  Any business activity by lamas usually consists of 
handicrafts, restaurants or transport services for local 
farmers. The region now has about 34,000 lamas. 
  According to Zhou, major monasteries in Lhasa have solved 
the 
problem of shortage of funds by such measures, while the other 
areas still have difficulties in this direction. 
  He added that lamas enjoy a good "business image" because of 
their respectable standing. 
  Local residents prefer lamas' service as they do not seek 
excessive profits. 
  For instance, lamas in Shannan Prefecture who are offering 
transport services have two hand-carts, a truck and a ferry 
boat. Poor farmers can get free-of-charge ferry crossings if 
they cannot afford the fare.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The Public Health 
Department of Lhasa city, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous 
Region, has adopted a variety of methods in recent years to 
improve the sanitary conditions for local Tibetan residents. 
  The city has more than 280,000 farmers and herdsmen in the 
surrounding rural areas. As the drinking water in the area 
lacks iodine and selenium, the city has invested more than three 
million yuan since 1990 to build nearly 400 water supply 
stations with water supply pipes and deep wells. 
  The local government is also persuading and helping local 
villagers to build lavatories. Now more than 3,600 household 
lavatories have been built. 
  The Public Health Department has shot several video tapes 
including "water and public health" and "women's and children's 
hygiene" and broadcast them in rural areas to heighten sanitary 
knowledge. 
  A book about hygiene was written and has become part of a 
compulsory course for primary school pupils in the area.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 31 (XINHUA) -- People in this capital of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region seldom ate fresh vegetables a decade 
ago, but now they have all sorts of vegetables coming from all 
the other parts of the country everyday. 
  Qimai, a 40-year-old resident of this highland city, still 
remembered her trips to the interior parts of the country and 
the things she bought. 
  "When I returned home I brought back many things for my 
family members, who appreciated the fresh vegetables most." 
  Vegetables are the main dishes on the tables of Chinese 
families, but, located at an altitude of 4,000 m above sea 
level, Lhasa has poor conditions for vegetable growing. 
  "We used to have radishes, potatoes and Chinese cabbage in 
winter. The vegetable variety was limited even in summer," 
Qimai said. 
  "However, things have changed with the introduction of the 
market economy and the government's efforts," she noted. 
  Every Sunday morning the middle-aged woman visits the nearby 
Zongqolukang Market, the largest in the city with a total 
transactional volume of 140 million yuan last year. 
  In less than one hour she returns home with two baskets of 
green fresh vegetables. 
  "Now we can buy every kind of vegetables and fruits we need 
here," she said happily. 
  The 100-m-long Zongqolukang Market, with five rows of 
stalls, 
has hotbed chives, balsam pears and "jinzhen" fungus from nearby 
Sichuan Province, sweetbell red peppers from south China's 
Guangdong Province, and garlic bolts, in addition to locally 
grown cucumbers, pumpkins, asparagus, tomatoes and cauliflowers. 
  "The varieties here are similar to those in the markets in 
Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province," said a Sichuan pedlar who 
regularly ships vegetables from Chengdu to Lhasa by air. 
  At present, Lhasa has seven major vegetable markets, where 
the sellers are mainly From Sichuan. 
  Among them is Xiang Hengguang from Chongqing, the largest 
city in southwest China, who claimed to be the first vegetable 
pedlar from the outside to the city. 
  In 1985 he rented a truck to transport vegetables from 
Sichuan to Lhasa along the bumpy Sichuan-Tibet highway. 
  "I could not find any market when I first arrived in Lhasa," 
he said, "but my vegetables quickly sold out." 
  Now, about 300 pedlars specialize in transporting vegetables 
from Chengdu, Lanzhou (capital of Gansu Province) and Xining, 
capital of Qinghai Province, to the highland city. 
  Xiang said, "sometimes, we have to ship fresh vegetables by 
air from southwest China's Yunnan Province or to Xining first, 
and then hire trucks to carry them to Lhasa along the 
Qinghai-Tibet Highway." 
  Once the vegetables arrive in Lhasa pedlars clean them and 
put them in order at market stalls. 
  "It is worth doing such business when we see people happily 
buying what they want and when we count the money we have earned 
with our efforts," the 46-year-old man said. 
  To encourage more pedlars to come to Lhasa, the city 
government began to lift the control of vegetable prices and 
grant preferential treatment to anyone who transported and sold 
vegetables in Lhasa in 1984. It also built a number of markets. 
  While encouraging farmers to grow vegetables, the city 
government spent nine million yuan building three vegetable 
farms around the city in 1986. 
  At present, the city produces about 30,000 tons of 
vegetables 
in more than 40 varieties a year.

  [Text] Kunming, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's Yunnan 
Province, rich in hydropower and coal resources, is now engaged 
in the construction of power plants and stations, aiming to 
become a power base for south China and even the neighboring 
countries. 
  It is estimated that the province has coal deposits of 22.9 
billion tons and hydropower resources of 71.16 million kw, 
ranking second in the country, and only five percent of these 
resources have been explored. 
  At present, the province is building hydropower stations 
along the Lancang and Jinsha Rivers. 
  By now, two generating units of 500,000 kw have been put 
into 
operation along the Lancang River. Eight other stations with a 
total generating capacity of 15.2 million kw are now under 
construction. 
  According to Yao Qunqin, an engineer at the Kunming 
Hydropower Surveying and Design Institute, all eight power 
stations along the Lancang River will be finished by 2020. 
  Along the Jinsha River, 19 cascade hydropower stations with 
a 
total generating capacity of 75 million kw are also planned to 
be built in the next century. 
  The province also plans to build several new thermal power 
plants and enlarge existing ones. Some German and Australian 
investors have shown interest in cooperating with the province. 
  Yao said that the province will become the country's largest 
electricity producer by 2020, supplying more than 80 billion kwh 
of electricity every year to southern and eastern Chinese 
provinces and cities.

  [Text] Taiyuan, May 30 (XINHUA) -- More and more 
international financial aid is pouring into the poverty-stricken 
areas of north China's Shanxi Province to enliven the local 
economy, according to an official of the province. 
  The official said the majority of the international funding 
went to the construction of infrastructural facilities to pave 
the way for the economic development of these areas. 
  The latest data shows that the Xiaoyi-Liulin railway, a 
project built with a loan of 39.7 million U.S. dollars from the 
Asian bank, has now opened to traffic. 
  The bank has also offered another 65 million U.S. dollars to 
build the Liulin Power Plant, the biggest of its sort in the 
province. 
  Also, the World Bank has provided 47 million U.S. dollars to 
build a water-control project in the Weifen River area in 
Xinxian County of northwestern Shanxi and an agricultural 
project in Luliang Prefecture, a revolutionary base during the 
war of resistance against Japan (1937-45) and China's war of 
liberation (1945-49). 
  In 1992, the prefecture was rendered gratis grain assistance 
of more than 78,000 tons of wheat by the joint UN-FAO [Food and 
Agriculture Organization] World Food Program. 
  Japan has also provided farm machinery and fertilizer worth 
30 million yen to enrich the soil in the area. 
  So far, the prefecture has built 46 foreign-funded joint 
ventures, 27 of which were built in 1993, with a total foreign 
investment of 13.62 million U.S. dollars. 
  With its fast-growing economy, the prefecture's tourism 
industry is also developing at a considerable speed. In 1993, 
it received 3,575 foreign tourists.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 30 (XINHUA) -- North China's biggest 
industrial center is taking steps to readjust the industrial 
structure to invigorate the state-owned enterprises and enable 
them to be more competitive in the current socialist market 
economy. 
  According to an official with the municipal planning 
commission, the city's strategy of restructuring state-owned 
enterprises was projected as early as in the 1980s. 
  The official said that its focus of the restructuring is on 
the development of auto, machinery, micro-electronics and 
communications equipment, petroleum, marine and refined 
chemicals industries, quality steel pipes and other steel 
products. 
  He said that Tianjin, as the third largest city in the 
country, has already formed a comprehensive industrial system in 
which light industry has played a considerable part since 1949 
when New China was born. 
  But, he added, the policies of reform and opening to the 
outside world have given rise to numerous joint ventures and 
township enterprises which are posing a great challenge to the 
state-owned ones and rendering them less effective in a market 
economy. 
  To support the state-owned enterprises, the investment from 
the local government has mainly gone to the four main industries 
for automobiles, electronics, chemistry, and metallurgy, the 
official said. 
  The city has now become one of the biggest auto production 
centers and the annual production output of autos has reached 
120,000, he said, adding that it has added an investment of 2.8 
billion yuan to expand its production to 450,000 autos each year. 
  The official said that one of the steps the city has taken 
to 
restructure industry is to develop the local electronics 
industry through international cooperation. 
  To date, he said, Tianjin has developed computer-controlled 
telephone exchanges, video recorders and computers jointly with 
many world-renowned companies, such as the U.S. giants IBM and 
AST, Japan's NEC and Samsung of the Republic of Korea. 
  In addition, the U.S. Motorola company has built a 
semiconductor and portable telephone production center in 
Tianjin, he said. 
  The official said that many of the country's vital chemical 
plants are located in Tianjin. Two of the country's biggest oil 
fields, the Dagang and Bohai fields, are also under city 
jurisdiction. 
  A number of petroleum and marine-chemical projects are being 
built in the city, including a 140,000-ton ethylene project, a 
200,000-ton polyester plant and a 2.5-million-ton refinery, he 
said. 
  He said that the Bohai chemical group, the country's biggest 
salt-chemical industrial group, has recently been listed in Hong 
Kong to raise more money to develop China's fine chemicals. 
  In Tianjin, he said, the most attractive project is the 
Tianjin Steel Pipe Company, with a total investment of more than 
ten billion yuan and an annual output of 500,000 tons of 
seamless steel pipes. 
  The planning official concluded that when completed, all 
these projects will change the city's industrial structure and 
become the mainstays of the city's industries. And the output 
value of these four major industries last year already accounted 
for about 70 percent of the city's industrial total.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamed is confident that the uptrend of 
Malaysian-Chinese relations will be further reinforced in the 
future. 
  He said this in his message to his Chinese counterpart Li 
Peng today on the occasion of the 20th anniversary (May 31) of 
the founding of the diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. 
  "Links between Malaysia and China actually stretched a long 
way back into history, but it is only over the last two decades 
that our bilateral relationship has reached a new level of 
understanding and cooperation," Mahathir said. 
  "The policy of friendly relations with neighboring countries 
has encouraged positive developments in our bilateral relations, 
particularly in recent years," he said. 
  He added: "In the past five years or so, bilateral relations 
have increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation. 
  "I am confident that this trend will be further reinforced 
in 
the years to come. Aside from the rapid increase in economic 
cooperation, trade and investment, cooperation in other fields 
such as tourism, cultural exchanges and people-to-people 
contacts will further encourage better understanding and 
friendship between Malaysia and China."

<F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "Qinghai Seeks Full Use of Local Resources"] </F>
  [Text] Xining, Qinghai Province--Through international 
cooperation, this land-locked province in northwest China is 
determined to step up developing the rich resources hidden in 
its snow-and-grass covered plateau. 
  As a first step, Qinghai will begin 28 projects exploiting 
natural resources this year, according to Governor Tian 
Chengping. 
  One of them is the second expansion stage of Qinghai Potash 
Fertilizer Corporation, a key state project. It is expected to 
get technical help from Israel. 
  The inland province has been trying hard to lure outside 
investment. Although the efforts have been deterred by the 
province's arid weather and craggy terrain, Qinghai had acquired 
$430 million from 14 countries and regions by the end of 1993. 
Funding has come from the United States, Japan, Australia, and 
Hong Kong. 
  The local authorities expect that foreign investments and 
overseas preferential loans to the province will total $200 
million this year. 
  The provincial government plans to build hydropower stations 
on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, opening up oil fields 
and developing its abundant salt reserves. 
  The province has cooperated extensively with other parts of 
the nation. 
  In building the huge Lijiaxia Hydropower Station, for 
example, the province and its neighbours--Shaanxi, Gansu, and 
Ningxia--are working together. They are sharing 20 percent of 
the total investment of 3 billion yuan ($348 million) in the 
station, which is expected to go into operation in 1996. 
  From 1988 through 1993, the province had signed 1,137 
cooperative contracts with other parts of the nation, absorbing 
384 million yuan ($45 million). 
  The province has also established 384 factories or offices 
in 
other parts of China. Qinghai, a province almost as large as 
France and Britain combined, is lightly populated with 4.6 
million people. But it contains 119 minerals of which 48, 
including salt, oil, gold and nonferrous metals, are among the 
nation's top 10 reserves. 
  The province is the source of the country's great rivers: 
The Yangtze [Chiang Jiang], the Yellow, and the Lancang 
(Mekong), and has abundant hydropower.

  [Text] Urumqi, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Karamay, China's oldest 
oilfield, which in the 1970s seemed to be declining, has found a 
new lease of life. 
  In the past dozen years, many new oil deposits have been 
discovered there and new oil-extraction techniques have been 
developed, so that now the oilfield again radiates the vigor of 
youth. 
  For several years running, the oilfield's annual crude oil 
output has showed a yearly average increase of 300,000 tons. 
Last year, the oilfield produced 7.6 million tons of crude oil. 
For the past four years its output has been the fourth largest 
in China. 
  Karamay oilfield was established at a deserted place -- with 
no grass, water or even a bird -- in the north-west part of the 
Junggar Basin in north-west China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region. Its first well started to produce crude oil on October 
29, 1955. 
  The annual output of the oilfield reached 1.6 million tons 
in 
1960. But by the mid 1970s the oil output started to drop and 
no new deposits had been found. The oilfield was thought to be 
declining. The people in Karamay were worried about their 
future. 
  When the Chinese Central Government started to adopt the 
policy of reform and opening to the world in 1979, the people at 
the Karamay oilfield were greatly encouraged. They launched a 
drive to tap the potential of the old area of the oilfield and 
open up new parts. 
  Karamay is rich in reserves of heavy oil. Since the oil seam 
is close to the surface, the light elements and gases of the oil 
had volatilized long ago. So the oil looks like asphalt and is 
difficult to extract. 
  In the light of advanced foreign and domestic technology, 
technical personnel at Karamay oilfield overcame a series of 
difficulties and succeeded in extracting the oil by injecting 
vapour into the oil below ground. As a result, the oilfield's 
output of heavy oil increased greatly and has stabilized at 1.5 
million tons annually for three consecutive years. 
  The technicians also used the latest technology to 
re-analyze 
the prospecting data of the old area of the oilfield, 
discovering three layers of oil deposits in the strata above and 
below the old oil- bearing stratum, thus paving the way for 
increasing the oil output in the old area. 
  The oil experts and technicians, using advanced prospecting 
technology and equipment, discovered and opened up several new 
oil-bearing areas, including the Fengchen, Xiazejie, Dongpaizi, 
Maozhuang and Huoshaoshan oilfields. The oil output of the new 
oilfields has surpassed one million tons a year. 
  As its oil output increases, Karamay has also developed its 
own oil-processing industries. The oilfield is now capable of 
refining 5.45 million tons of crude oil per year and producing 
over 190 oil products, 39 of which meet international standards. 
More than 20 of them are exported to Japan, the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea and many countries and regions in 
South-East Asia. 
  A plant to produce 140,000 tons of ethylene annually is now 
being built, due to be completed next year. Experts noted that 
with completion of the project, Karamay will again enter a 
golden age, both in oil production and oil refining.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- Despite the geographic 
distance, and language and cultural barriers separating them, 
the Republic of China [ROC] and the Commonwealth of Independent 
States should start to developing closer ties in bilateral 
economic and cultural cooperation, Premier Lien Chan said 
Saturday [28 May]. 
  Lien made the remarks when meeting Nikolai I. Ryzkov, former 
prime minister of the Soviet Union, who arrived in Taipei Friday 
for a week-long visit. 
  As the ROC and CIS economies are of a complementary nature, 
more cooperative ventures between the two sides should further 
benefit both, Lien said, adding that the CIS' high technologies 
and abundant natural resources would be a boon to the ROC, whose 
experience in economic development could be helpful as a model 
for the CIS as it charts a course toward a more open economy. 
  Ryzkov, who hopes to establish communication channels 
between 
the CIS and the ROC during this trip, agreed with Lien, saying 
there is still ample room for growth in all fields between the 
two sides, and that Taipei and Moscow should immediately begin 
trade and economic cooperation as a first step to establishing a 
full-range of cooperative ties.

  [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
hopes to develop substantive ties with all friendly, democratic 
countries in a pragmatic manner, President Li Teng-hui said 
Monday [30 May]. 
  Li made the statement while meeting with Nikolay I. Ryzhkov, 
a former prime minister of the now defunct Soviet Union, who is 
currently on a week-long visit here. 
  After more than 40 years of development, Li said, Taiwan has 
emerged as an economic powerhouse in East Asia. 
  "We are willing to share our experience in economic 
development with other countries," Li told his guest. 
  For years, Li said, Taiwan has also provided financial aid 
for many developing countries as part of its effort to return 
what it has received from the international community during its 
development process. 
  With the demise of communism, Li said he believes civilian 
exchanges between Taiwan and Russia will grow steadily in the 
years ahead. 
  Ryzhkov said he was impressed by the social stability and 
economic prosperity here. "I hope relations between our two 
countries can be further strengthened," he added. 
  Ryzhkov told Li he has joined with several Taiwan and 
Russian 
politicians and businessmen to form a permanent organization to 
boost economic, cultural and technological cooperation between 
the two countries. The new body is called the Republic of China 
and Russia International Association for Humanitarian Dialogue. 
  Li said he appreciates Ryzhkov's effort to help forge 
Taipei-Moscow ties by creating the new dialogue channel. 
"Increased civilian exchanges will lay a foundation for our 
future cooperation," he added.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Saturday [28 May] sent a written 
message to Mainland China's Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) proposing negotiations be held in early 
June between the two sides on cross-strait travel security. 
  SEF, the quasi-official organization in charge of civilian 
affairs between Taiwan and Mainland China, said in the message 
that the March 31 Qiandao Lake disaster and its mishandling by 
mainland authorities underscored the lack of an effective and 
immediate communication channel between the two sides when an 
accident occurs. 
  Amid public outrage and criticism over the incident in 
Taiwan, SEF said the two sides should hold talks to devise a 
formula for Taiwan-Mainland China travel security, and to build 
a safer environment for cross-strait travel. 
  In addition to the travel security issue, SEF, on May 25, 
proposed to hold negotiations with ARATS in early June on 
compensation for the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao 
Lake incident, but ARATS has yet to respond to the request.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- A ranking government 
official said on Friday [27 May] that cultural exchanges between 
Taiwan and Mainland China, frozen after the Qiandao Lake 
murders, may resume next month. 
  Su Chi, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), 
told a seminar that MAC will hold a meeting in June to discuss 
the resumption of cultural exchanges with the mainland. 
  Earlier this month, the cabinet-level MAC put a hold on cash 
it had planned to use to finance cultural and educational 
exchanges with the mainland to protest Beijing's callous 
handling of the Qiandao Lake crime. 
  Twenty-four Taiwan tourists, along with two mainland guides 
and six crewmembers, were robbed and killed on the lower deck of 
a pleasure boat ferrying them across the scenic lake in Zhejiang 
Province, eastern China, on March 31. 
  Beijing denied that the killings took place and did not make 
any arrests until Taiwan threatened to comprehensively review 
the existing ties between the two sides. 
  The mainland security authorities have charged three and 
arrested a fourth suspect in the mass murder. The move, however 
failed to thaw the frozen ties as many questions surrounding the 
deaths remain. 
  "The distrust and psychological trauma that have been 
brought 
to the general public is most worrying for long term relations," 
Su warned. 
  "To narrow the widening cultural and social differences, 
special efforts from both sides are needed ... and cultural 
exchanges, among others, are believed to be the most effective 
remedy," Su said. 
  The Government of the Republic of China [ROC] in 1987 lifted 
its decades-old ban on visits to the mainland by Taiwan 
residents for family reunions. Since then millions of local 
people have visited the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
Monday [30 May] called on leading industrialists to help develop 
Taiwan's industrial base in order to ensure continued economic 
growth and boost domestic competitiveness in international 
markets. 
  Li made the statement while meeting with a group of 20 
industrialists, headed by Chairman Kao Ching-yuan of the Chinese 
National Federation of Industries. 
  To seek further progress, Li said, the industrial sector 
should learn how to make the best use of its resources and 
stress personnel training as well as research and development. 
  The government will cooperate with the industrial sector in 
mapping out appropriate policies and laws to help domestic 
industries cope with challenges and competition from abroad, Li 
pledged. 
  Various phases of economic development call for different 
strategies, he added. 
  Li talked with the industrialists on a variety of economic 
and noneconomic issues, including financing, investment, the 
national health insurance program, the introduction of foreign 
laborers to Taiwan, environmental protection, and Taiwan's entry 
into GATT. 
  Among the industrial representatives were President Liu 
Kuo-chao of the Taiwan Electric Appliance Manufacturers 
Association, President Lu Chi-sheng of the Taiwan Association of 
Machinery Industry, and Chairman Wang Yiu-tzeng of the China 
Rebar Group. 
  The president said that he was happy to exchange views with 
the industrialists. Noting he has already met with delegates 
from the agricultural and fishery sectors, he said he will also 
meet with business and labor [passage indistinct] the Chinese 
Federation of Labor on June 10.

  [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- The government is seeking 
ways to cut the growing trade deficit with Japan, including 
setting up a holding company to produce key parts and components 
here and cut Japanese imports of the products, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs said Monday [30 May]. 
  The ministry officials said that Economics Minister P. K. 
Chiang will meet with more than 60 entrepreneurs on June 14 to 
promote the idea and seek investments in the holding company. 
  The ministry hopes that the holding company can come up with 
NT [new Taiwan] $10 billion (US$370 million) in its first year. 
  The officials said that although guidelines to reduce the 
trade deficit with Japan were established more than three years 
ago, they have had little effect. 
  They said that studies indicate the key to reducing large 
trade deficits lie in technology transfers. If the key parts 
and components now imported from Japan can be produced here, the 
deficit will fall. 
  The ministry is now screening 75 technology-intensive 
Japanese products which cost more than US$75 million each to 
import every year. The ministry will then choose ten of the 
products for domestication. 
  The officials noted that they will take into consideration 
domestic and foreign market demand, minimum investment and 
possibility of technology transfer when selecting the 10 
products. 
  The holding company will either produce the 10 products by 
itself or seek cooperation with foreign partners. 
  Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan hit a record high of 
US$14.42 billion in 1993 and is expected to reach US$15 billion 
this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The United States, while 
seeking to improve relations with Mainland China, should not 
damage the Republic of China's [ROC] national interests, a 
Foreign Ministry official said Saturday [28 May]. 
  Tu Chu-sheng, director of the ministry's North American 
Affairs Department, made the call during a public hearing on 
Taipei- Washington-Beijing ties sponsored by several private 
groups here. 
  Tu said Taipei-Washington relations should be separated from 
American relations with Mainland China. 
  "We have never intervened in Washington-Beijing relations," 
Tu said. "We hope both Beijing and Washington would never 
promote their bilateral ties at the expense of our national 
interests." 
  Taiwan also hopes the US Government will pragmatically face 
the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now 
ruled by two different governments which exercise full 
jurisdiction over their own territories, Tu said. "We hope the 
US can handle its relations with Taipei and Beijing separately." 
  He further said it has been Taiwan's goal to push the US 
Government to treat the two sides of the Taiwan Strait equally 
before China's reunification. 
  US President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he will renew 
Mainland China's "most-favored-nation" (MFN) trade status and 
sever the link between trade and human rights. 
  Tu said Clinton's decision marks a turning point in the 
improvement of Washington-Beijing relations. However, it 
remains unclear whether the Clinton administration will become 
more flexible in handling its ties with Taiwan, he noted. 
  Recent public speeches by US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher show no signs that the Clinton administration is 
ready to make any major change in the so-called "one China" 
policy which the US has upheld since it recognized Beijing in 
1979, Tu said. 
  He continued that Taipei-Washington relations have remained 
steady under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law 
defining American ties with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic 
relations. 
  However, Tu said, the current unofficial links cannot 
effectively reflect close substantive relations between the ROC 
and the US. America is Taiwan's top export market, while the ROC 
is America's sixth largest trade partner. 
  The ROC Government has attached great importance to its 
relations with the US, Tu said, adding Taiwan will use its 
political and economic clout to further strengthen relations 
with America. 
  Taipei hopes the US will continue to sell it defensive arms 
and support its bid to join the United Nations and other 
international organizations, Tu said. "We also hope the US will 
agree to change the title of our representative office in its 
territory to one that can better represent Taiwan," he added. 
  Taiwan's representative office is now called the 
Coordination 
Council for North American Affairs.

  [Text] Washington, May 26 (CNA) -- The Clinton 
administration will proceed with its review of US policy toward 
Taiwan in the next few weeks, White House Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake said Thursday [26 May] afternoon. 
  In response to questions at a press briefing, Lake denied 
that the Clinton administration has put its Taiwan policy review 
on hold in the past several months because of the issue of 
most-favored-nation trade status for Mainland China. 
  "I would prefer to say that it has been proceeding apace, 
rather than was on hold," he said. 
  Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian 
and 
Pacific affairs, said a high-level meeting on the issue would be 
held soon. 
  Asked whether the administration will consider increasing 
contact with Taiwan and Tibet as a tool to push for human-rights 
progress in the mainland, Lord noted that the United States 
already maintains a strong unofficial relationship with Taiwan, 
and has done so through several administrations. 
  "If anything, we believe it has become stronger in this 
administration. We will pursue that," he said. 
  Lord said the one-China policy of the United States is very 
successful because it permits the United States to improve its 
relationship with Beijing and at the same time allows it to 
maintain a strong friendship with Taiwan and strengthen Taiwan's 
de facto security. 
  "So, we will not play games or alter our one-China policy. 
We will continue to strengthen our unofficial ties with Taiwan. 
It's worked for many administrations. It's going to work under 
this administration," he said. 
  He added that the Clinton administration also will continue 
contacts with the Dalai Lama. 
  He said the administration is disappointed that Beijing has 
not yet agreed to enter into a dialogue with the Dalai Lama 
after the Tibetan spiritual leader stated openly that he was 
willing to hold talks without including the issue of Tibetan 
independence on the agenda. 
  Lake said the Clinton administration is "very disturbed" by 
many of Beijing's actions in Tibet with regard to Tibetan 
culture, and that the issue will remain on the US agenda with 
the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of 
the Council of Agriculture (COA), will visit the United States 
in late July to talk with American officials on trade sanctions 
against Taiwan for illegal rhino horn and tiger bone trade, 
council officials said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  The COA head will meet with officials of the US Department 
of 
the Interior and some wildlife conservation groups, the 
officials said [words indistinct]. 
  While Taiwan is set to face US import prohibitions on 
wildlife specimens and products, they noted, it is hoped that 
the United States will shorten the sanction period. 
  The office of US Trade Representative released a list of 
proposed import bans on Taiwan wildlife products in late April 
following an order by President Bill Clinton earlier that month. 
  The import bans, which are mandated under the Pelly 
amendment 
to the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967, are expected to be 
put into practice in mid-June. 
  Taiwan products targeted for US import prohibition include 
shoes and handbags made from reptile skins, jewelry made from 
coral, mussel shells and bones, edible frogs' legs, live 
goldfish and tropical fish for the aquarium trade, and bird 
feathers. 
  The COA officials held optimistic views about a shorter 
sanction period, saying the prospect will be better if the 
legislature passes a series of amendments to the wildlife 
conservation act by the end of June. 
  Sun is currently accompanying Premier Lien Chan on a visit 
to 
El Salvador and Guatemala.

  [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Niger President Mahamane 
Ousmane is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Thursday [2 June] 
for a six-day visit, Foreign Ministry officials said Monday. 
  President Li Teng-hui and ranking government officials will 
greet Ousmane and his wife at Chiang Kai-shek International 
Airport. 
  With a land area of some 1.27 million square kilometers, 
Niger is the largest among the 29 countries with which Taiwan 
maintains official relations. It is rich in uranium deposits, 
and is one of the few countries in Africa that has a 
self-sufficient economy. 
  Osmane, who won Niger's first popular presidential election 
in March 1993, will sign a joint communique with President Li 
reaffirming Niger's support for Taiwan's bid to join the United 
Nations. 
  The Republic of China [ROC] first set up diplomatic 
relations 
with Niger in 1963. But ties were suspended for 11 years after 
Niger recognized Mainland China in July 1974. The two nations 
re- established formal ties in 1992. 
  An agricultural cooperation program that calls for Taiwan to 
help Niger grow rice is expected to be finalized during 
President Ousmane's visit. 
  Accompanying Ousmane in his first Taiwan trip will be Niger 
Foreign and Cooperation Minister Abdourahmane Hama, and Trade, 
Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdoulaye Souley.

  [Text] Madrid, May 27 (CNA) -- Taiwan registered its first 
four-monthly deficit ever with the European Union through April, 
according to customs statistics. 
  The trade deficit of US$40 million resulted from increasing 
imports from and decreasing exports to the EU, customs officials 
said. Taiwan registered a US$543 million trade surplus with the 
EU in the first four months of 1993. 
  During the January-April period, Taiwan imported US$3.596 
billion worth of products from the EU, a growth of 8.7 percent 
from the first four months of last year. Taiwan's exports to 
the area totaled only US$3.556 billion, a 7.7 percent decline, 
the statistics showed. 
  The US$7.153 billion in two-way trade between the two was a 
0.1 percent decline.

  [Text] San Salvador [words indistinct] Armando Calderon 
Sol assumes office, ROC [Republic of China] Ambassador Andrew J. 
P. Shen said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  "The ROC and El Salvador have enjoyed long-term friendly 
ties 
and this relationship is not expected to change under Calderon's 
leadership," Shen told the CNA in an interview. 
  During his visit to Taipei last October, Shen said, Calderon 
assured senior ROC officials that he will strengthen cooperation 
with the ROC and support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations 
if he wins the presidential election. 
  "Calderon was pleased when I told him recently that Premier 
Lien Chan would attend his inauguration," Shen noted. Lien, who 
served as ROC ambassador to El Salvador in the 1970s, is an old 
friend of Calderon. 
  Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, will arrive in San 
Salvador Tuesday night to attend the inaugural ceremony 
scheduled for Wednesday. 
  After a 12-year civil war, Shen said, the Central American 
country badly needs international assistance to rebuild its 
battered economy. 
  El Salvador provides many incentives, including a 10-year 
tax 
holiday, to attract foreign investors, Shen noted. "I hope more 
Taiwan businessmen can invest here to help boost this country's 
economic development." 
  Shen said Taiwan companies can use El Salvador as a gateway 
to the North American market because the United States imposes 
no quota restrictions on Salvadoran products. El Salvador has 
also joined with Guatemala and Honduras to sign a "free trade 
agreement" with Mexico to allow freer flow of commodities in the 
region. 
  There are some 10 Taiwan-owned companies in El Salvador, 
mainly producing garments for export. 
  Shen said there is still ample room for Taiwan-Salvadoran 
trade to grow. Taiwan exported US$20.7 million worth of goods 
to El Salvador in 1992, while importing US$50 million worth of 
Salvadoran products.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- A French technology 
exhibition will open at Taipei's World Trade Center on July 1, 
with more than 100 French manufacturers participating. 
  On display will be high-tech products from the aerospace, 
transportation, energy, telecommunications, electronics, 
measuring and control equipment, environmental technology, 
construction, medical, and petrochemical industries. 
  The four-day exhibition will be jointly sponsored by the 
French Institute in Taipei (FIT) and the French Committee for 
Trade Events Abroad (CFME). The show is the centerpiece of a 
series of "French Month" activities, which begin June 20. 
  Noted French high-tech companies such as Dassault, [passage 
indistinct] the Mirage-2000 jet fighter; high-speed railway 
manufacturer GEC Alsthom; Nuclear Energy Company Cogema, and 
Fram Atome will display their latest products at the show, which 
is France's biggest exhibition in Asia in the past 15 years. 
  CFME President Paul Hunsinoer said the French technology 
exhibition will introduce French expertise and developmental 
experiences in high technology to Taiwan firms, hopefully 
leading to bilateral cooperation. 
  FIT Director Jean Paul Reau said the French Government 
unveiled a forward-looking plan in February to promote a new 
strategy toward Asia aiming to increase its export ratio in the 
Asian market from the current 7 percent to more than 10 percent 
of its total exports within five years. He said Taiwan was at 
the forefront of the plan. 
  Reau said that because France specializes in some high-tech 
industries which are being developed here, it can fully supply 
and transfer its high-technologies to Taiwan. 
  Taiwan is situated at the hub of Asia and is an admirable 
economic and trade power, Reau said. He added that there is no 
barrier for technology transfer to the island. 
  Some 130 French enterprises have set up footholds in Taiwan, 
Reau said. He added that the French technology exhibition will 
allow the people of Taiwan to see a totally different view of 
France besides the traditionally romantic one. The second 
French technology exhibition is scheduled to be held in Kuala 
Lumpur in October this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Jordan recently asked the 
Republic of China [ROC] to cut Jordan's foreign debt based on 
the spirit of the "Paris Club," of which the ROC is not a member. 
  Jordan asked Taipei to cut some U.S.$1 million from its debt 
after Taipei agreed to cancel 75 percent of Nicaragua's 
U.S.$22.84 million in loans with the island. 
  According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, Jordan 
is 
not likely to be given the same treatment as Nicaragua. They 
said that Jordan's lack of diplomatic ties with Taiwan was the 
main reason which would prevent the foreign debt reduction. 
  Jordan received several loans from the ROC in the 1970s, but 
has been unable to repay the debt as planned because of 
financial difficulties. 
  News that Taipei agreed to cancel 75 percent of the debt 
owned it by Nicaragua during ROC President Li Teng-hui's visit 
to the Central American country early this month fueled a spate 
of inquiries from several debtor countries for similar 
treatment, the officials said. 
  About 30 countries owe money to the ROC. 
  The "Paris Club" or G10, was established in 1962 by then 10 
international monetary fund member countries. It aims to unify 
loan terms and accords for international debtor nations. Club 
members reduce the foreign debts for nations which are plagued 
with anemic foreign exchange reserves but have started economic 
reforms that would secure future loan payments.

  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan and 
South Korea are meeting here to discuss resumption of bilateral 
fruit trade, which has been suspended since the two countries 
severed diplomatic ties in August 1992. 
  Chen Wu-hsiung, head of the Taiwan delegation to the 
meeting, 
said Taiwan is willing to import Korean pears and apples in 
exchange for Korea's importation of its bananas, oranges and 
litchis. 
  Chen, a department director of Taiwan's Council of 
Agriculture, arrived in Seoul Sunday [29 May] for the talks, 
which began Monday. Chang Shao-chun, Taiwan's deputy 
representative in Seoul, also took part in the negotiations. 
  Li Yong-le, director of the Farm Produce Distribution 
Bureau, 
is heading the Korean delegation to the talks. 
  Pressured by its fruit growers, South Korea is eager to 
resume fruit trade with Taiwan. 
  Before Seoul switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing, 
Taiwan allowed imports of a specified amount of Korean pears and 
apples annually in exchange for Korea's purchases of a similar 
amount of its bananas. 
  "We hope to include our oranges, litchis or mangoes in 
future 
fruit exchanges," Chen explained. 
  The two sides reached consensus on some basic principles 
during Monday talks. They will discuss technical details 
Tuesday. If all goes smoothly, Chen said, a formal agreement 
will be signed at the end of the talks. 
  Diplomatic sources here said south Korea hopes to resume 
fruit trade with Taiwan as soon as possible. Taiwan used to be 
Korea's major apple and pear market. The Korean Government also 
hopes the resumption of fruit trade can pave the way for the 
re-opening of direct airlinks between the two countries, which 
were also suspended following the breakup of diplomatic ties, 
the sources said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- Vietnam and Taiwan will 
soon sign an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation, Le 
Sinh Tang, new director of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural 
Office in Taipei, said Friday [27 May]. 
  "Negotiations are under way to remove the last and small 
obstacle to the proposed pact," Le, who assumed his post on May 
19, said. 
  Le, a former Hanoi vice mayor, said he expects trade and 
economic exchanges between his country and Taiwan, especially in 
tourism and agricultural and technological cooperation, will 
continue to increase. 
  Taiwan is currently the largest source of foreign investment 
in Vietnam, having pumped US$1.5 billion into the country as of 
the end of last month. Both nations earlier this year signed an 
investment- guarantee agreement. 
  The Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office was set up in 
Taipei 
early last year, with Dao Duc Chinh, a former Foreign Ministry 
official, as acting director. He is now serving as Le's deputy. 
  Le refused to comment on the possibility that Vietnamese 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet might visit Taiwan. 
  Vo, while taking part in the annual conference of the 
Pacific 
Basin Economic Council in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week said he 
would be willing to visit Taiwan if invited. 
  Le, however, said many obstacles would have to be removed 
before Vo could visit, given the absence of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries.

<F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) 
on Friday [27 May] issued a position paper accusing the major 
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of blindly 
pressing for a temporary pension plan for senior citizens. 
  The sternly worded paper came out as the fifth and final day 
of a sit-in staged by the DPP to campaign for old-age benefits 
drew to a close. 
  Some 800 elderly joined the sit-in, during which the 
protesters called on the legislature to discuss the DPP-proposed 
"temporary rules for old-age benefits," which would enable the 
Executive Yuan to immediately earmark special funds for seniors. 
Such a temporary pension would be a transitional measure before 
a permanent pension plan could be implemented, the DPP said. 
  Saying "a wrong policy is worse than graft," the KMT accused 
the DPP of pushing its temporary pension plan even though it 
knows it is unworkable. It added that the pledge the DPP made 
late last year during local election campaigning to pay old-age 
benefits was actually a disguised means of vote-buying. 
  During the election campaign, DPP candidates promised that 
each person 65 years of age and older would receive a pension of 
NT$5,000 (us$185.18) per month, regardless of their financial 
circumstances. 
  The commitment, however, has resulted in a dilemma for the 
DPP, as five of the six counties where DPP members were elected 
magistrates late last year have been plagued by financial woes. 
  The KMT said the DPP has declined to admit wrongdoing for 
fear of losing face and future elections. The position paper 
said the DPP's pension campaign is actually an attempt to win 
the Taiwan governorship, and pointed to the immorality of 
treating the elderly as "stage properties of politics." 
  Moreover, it stressed, "it does not make sense for the KMT 
to 
endorse the election check drawn by the DPP." 
  Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh made an apology to 
Taiwan's senior citizens, saying he regretted that the KMT did 
not respond favorably to the sit-in. 
  Reiterating the DPP's determination to pay old-age benefits, 
Shih pledged that the opposition party will continue to strive 
for the welfare of the elderly. A reasonable distribution of 
the nation's overall resources would enable the government to 
take good care of senior citizens, he said. 
  As a follow-up to the sit-in, the DPP has decided to launch 
a 
large-scale demonstration on June 26 to promote the well-being 
of the elderly.

four-pronged approach in its bid to build Taiwan into an Asia- 
Pacific business operations center, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of 
the Council for Economic Planning and Development said late 
Friday [27 May]. 
  Hsiao made the statement on the second and final day of a 
two-day Asia-Pacific Conference of the International Association 
of Financial Executives Institutes (IAFEI). 
  The government will strive to promote economic 
liberalization 
and entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to 
enhance the sound development of trade ties across the Taiwan 
strait, to improve the economic structure, and to overhaul 
outdated rules and regulations, he noted. 
  Emphasis will be placed on the exchanges of manpower, goods, 
capital and information, on cross-strait cooperation in labor 
force and resources, on infrastructure construction, and on 
revising laws involving transportation, telecommunications, and 
financing, he elaborated. 
  Stressing that trade ties between Taiwan and other parties 
of 
the Asia-Pacific region have been cordial, he said two-way trade 
reached US$120 billion last year, accounting for 75 percent of 
Taiwan's total foreign trade volume. 
  As of the end of 1993, he pointed out, Taiwan investors 
channeled about US$20 billion into this part of the world, of 
which US$15 billion went to Mainland China. 
  Judging from Taiwan's geographical location, economic 
performance, technical knowhow, high-caliber manpower, and 
cultural background, the island boasts many advantages in its 
ambition to become an Asia-Pacific business operations hub, he 
said. 
  The IAFEI's Asia-Pacific meeting was held in Taipei in 
coincidence with the 20th anniversary of the Financial 
Executives Institute of the Republic of China [ROC], which 
sponsored the two- day forum. 
  Governor Samuel Shieh of the central bank of China and 
Indonesia's Industry Minister Tunki Ariwibowo [name as received] 
were invited to deliver keynote speeches at the meeting. 
  The conference, which had as its theme "prosperity through 
cooperation and integration," brought together a number of 
financial heavyweights including IAFEI President Brian Rose, 
President Emilia Bien Bien Roxas [name as received] of the Asia 
Trust Group, and Director I. R. M. Ramsay of Jardine Fleming 
Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- A total of 93 private 
domestic business investment projects worth over NT [new Taiwan] 
$146.93 billion (US$5.44 billion) are slated to begin this year, 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Saturday [28 May]. 
  In addition to the 93 major private investments, worth over 
NT$200 million (US$7.4 million) each, another 206 projects with 
a combined value of NT$1.08 trillion (US$40 billion), are 
expected to be completed before 1997, the ministry's Industrial 
Development Bureau said. 
  Some 39.2 percent of all private investments were in the 
petrochemical industry, worth NT$427.87 billion (US$15.84 
billion). The largest investment was made by Formosa Plastics 
for the development of Taiwan's sixth naphtha cracking plant. 
  Basic metal processing followed with NT$331.48 billion 
(US$12.27 billion), or 30.4 percent of all private investments, 
and the electronics and electrical machinery industries came in 
third with NT$125.61 billion (US$4.65 billion), or 11.5 percent.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- Foreign investors are 
working to make inroads into the peripheral businesses for the 
air transportation industry in Taiwan, trade sources said 
Saturday [28 May]. 
  The sources made the remark after the ministry of economic 
affairs approved an investment plan by Hong Kong's Alde Burgh 
Ltd. to open a flight kitchen company here. Alde Burgh is an 
affiliated firm of the Swire Group, a business conglomerate in 
the British colony. 
  The project calls for a total investment of NT [new Taiwan)0 
$2.27 billion (US$84.07 million), half of which will come from a 
bank loan. 
  This is the second such project to get the green light here. 
Earlier this month, the ministry approved a similar investment 
plan by an American company. 
  The sources forecast that a growing number of foreign 
enterprises will join domestic air freight peripheral businesses 
as Taiwan aims to become an Asia-Pacific air transportation 
center. 
  Moreover, they pointed out, Lockheed Aircraft Corp. of the 
United States has decided to increase investment in its Taiwan 
subsidiary by NT$610 million (US$22.59 million) to open a 
production as well as repair and maintenance center for flight 
control systems. 
  The capital increment plan has already been approved by the 
ministry, they added.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Most export processing zone 
(EPZ) manufacturers are optimistic about the export outlook in 
the second quarter of 1994, according to a survey conducted by 
the EPZ administration recently. 
  A total of 91 manufacturers in the EPZ, or 50 percent of 
those surveyed, said they thought exports will remain stable in 
the second quarter. This is up from 46 percent from a similar 
survey in the first quarter. 
  Fifty-nine manufacturers, or 33 percent, said they thought 
exports would take a turn for the better, higher than the 23 
percent in the first quarter. 
  However, 31 manufacturers, or 17 percent, thought exports 
would become worse. This is down from 31 percent in the 
previous quarter. 
  EPZ officials said this [words indistinct] on rising [words

  [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Taiwan may ask Japan and 
South Korea to adhere to a self-imposed limit on car exports to 
the island after Taiwan opens its car market to foreign 
countries, economic officials said Monday [30 May]. 
  Taiwan, in a bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and 
Trade, is planning to open the car market by lowering tariffs, 
abolishing local content rate requirements and canceling 
existing bans on imports from certain countries. 
  But Taiwan will follow the example of the United States and 
the European Union and seek to reach "tacit agreements" with 
Japan and South Korea, asking them to voluntarily set quotas on 
their car exports to the island, 
  The officials explained that to ask a country which enjoys a 
surplus to sign such a voluntary restraint agreement is not in 
violation of the spirit of GATT. Japan had a trade surplus of 
U.S.$15 billion last year, while South Korea's was U.S.$1 
billion. 
  The government, in the meantime, will consider allowing 
foreign carmakers to set up production here in a bid to "force" 
the 11 local makers to streamline operations. Poorly performing 
local makers then would be phased out in the face of stronger 
competition brought in by the newcomers, they said. 
  The officials revealed that three foreign makers have 
contacted the ministry on the possibility of setting up plants 
in Taiwan. 
  According to an earlier assessment by the ministry, local 
makers' market share will fall to 30 percent from the existing 
50 percent after Taiwan enters GATT.

  [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- More than 14,000 pirated 
video tapes and 6,000 laser discs were crushed Saturday [28 May] 
to mark the government's determination to end intellectual 
property rights (IPR) infringement in Taiwan. 
  The counterfeit tapes and discs, worth over NT [New Taiwan] 
$20 million (US$740,000), were destroyed in an annual IPR 
crackdown campaign sponsored by the Government Information 
Office, National Bureau of Standards, and the Copyrights 
Protection Committee of the Interior Ministry. 
  In a speech before the ceremonial destruction, Vice Interior 
Minister Yang Pao-fa said Taiwan is entering a "users pay" era 
after the country vowed to join the international community in a 
campaign to eliminate IPR and copyright infringement. 
  Yang said it is particularly important for Taiwan to observe 
IPR protection practices as the country is supposed to develop 
intellectual property rights protection relations with 118 
member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) upon joining the world trade regulatory body. 
  Yang urged the public to cooperate with the government in 
achieving the ambitious goal of making Taiwan a 
"counterfeit-free" country.

  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance 
said Friday [27 May] that it will impose extra tariffs on 
polypropylene imported from South Korea and Japan beginning June 
1. 
  Taiwan Polypropylene Corp. filed an anti-dumping complaint 
with the ministry in December 1992, saying Japanese and Korean 
polypropylene suppliers have sold their products here below fair 
market price, harming the local polypropylene industry. 
  Polypropylene is a petrochemical material widely used in 
industry and in the production of plastic bags, plastic bottles, 
toys and the housings for washing machines. 
  Wu Chia-sheng, director of the ministry's Department of 
Customs Administration, said the tariff commission decided to 
impose the anti-dumping tax after an investigation proved the 
complaint to be true. 
  Ten Japanese companies involved in dumping polypropylene in 
Taiwan will face extra import duties ranging between 5.16 
percent and 68.71 percent, while eight South Korean suppliers 
will face an additional tax of between 5.4-35.01 percent. The 
tax rates vary with import quantities and prices. 
  An industry official recalled that while the investigation 
was underway, a Korean Petrochemical Association had proposed to 
freeze the prices on the imports of Korean polypropylene in 
exchange for an end to the probe. 
  The offer was rejected by the tariff commission because the 
proposal was not considered an effective measure "to end harm to 
the local industry," the official said. 
  This was the fifth anti-dumping case acted upon by the 
government since last year when Taiwan imposed an extra tax on 
imports of Japanese-manufactured sodium hydrosulfite, a man-made 
ingredient widely used by the dyeing industry.

  [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Most women feel they are 
not equally respected or granted the same rights as men in 
Taiwan, a survey conducted and made public on Monday [30 May] by 
the cabinet's research, development and evaluation commission 
found. 
  The telephone survey on women's rights cgvered 1,012 men and 
1,007 women aged more than 18 years. The survey had an error 
margin of plus or minus 2.2 percent. 
  Almost half the respondents said women do not have the same 
job opportunities or potential to advance in their jobs as men 
do, whether because of their sex, age, marital status or because 
they are mothers, as against 40 percent of the respondents who 
said this was not the case. 
  About 78 percent of the respondents agreed that women have 
the same freedom to express themselves within their families 
that men have, while 62 percent said parents educate their 
children in a consistent way regardless of the child's sex. 
About 58 percent said female family members should have the 
same right of inheritance that males do. 
  Nearly half said women should be free to make decisions on 
their own regarding their sexual activities, while 35 precent 
were opposed to the idea. Additionally, 36 percent said women 
should be free to decide whether they want to have an abortion, 
while 44 percent said they should not. 
  And 66 percent, 58 percent and 67 percent of the 
respondents, 
respectively, said property management, disposal rights, and 
children's custody regulations in the civil code discriminate 
against women. 
  Nearly 50 percent said women who are abused, raped or 
abandoned do not receive sufficient protection or help from the 
government. 
  The survey also found that more than 90 percent of the 
public 
think men should share the burden of child care and housework at 
home, while 73 percent said they are in favor of male workers 
being given child-care leave. 
  Additionally, 62 percent said the number of posts reserved 
for women candidates in government elections should be 
guaranteed, according to the survey.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign

U.S. side will refrain from engaging in any official contacts

  The spokesman made the statement when asked to comment on a

over in the United States on his way to Latin America. 
  "We are deeply concerned over this matter", the spokesman 
noted, pointing out that the "transit diplomacy" or "vacation 
diplomacy" that the Taiwan authorities have been pursuing is 
designed to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". 
  "We hope that the U.S. side will implement the principles 
laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques in its 
action, refrain from engaging in any official contacts with the 
Taiwan authorities and prevent Lien Chan from making transit of 
the United States in any way, in the overall interests of 
Sino-U.S. relations", the spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin stressed here today the importance of conscientiously 
studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and correctly handling the relations 
between the reform, development and stability. 
  Addressing a theoretical study class for senior officials, 
Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, called for unremitting efforts to help arm the whole 
party with Deng's theory. 
  He asked officials at all levels, particularly senior 
officials, to attach top importance to the study of Deng's 
theory during the current new period. 
  He noted that only by becoming clear-headed theoretically, 
will it be possible for party and government officials to be 
firm politically, to become more conscientious in carrying out 
the party's basic line of taking economic construction as the 
central task, and to attain China's modernization goal. 
  The Marxist theoretical level of leading officials is 
essential to the success of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, he told senior officials from across the 
country attending the class in the party school of the party 
Central Committee. 
  That is why all officials, veteran and young, must continue 
to study Deng's theory assiduously and lead party members in 
studying the theory persistently, he added. 
  In studying the selected works of Deng Xiaoping, it is 
necessary to seek correct answers to the questions that have 
arisen in the course of reforms and economic construction, 
especially in building up a socialist market economy, Jiang said. 
  Speaking of how to balance the relations between the reform, 
development and stability, Jiang Zemin stressed the need to 
educate party members, officials and the people, on Deng 
Xiaoping's ideas on the issue. 
  Meanwhile, it is imperative to correctly grasp the current 
overall situation in China, and solve in a positive and 
appropriate way prominent problems adversely affecting the 
reform, development and stability, he said. 
  Furthermore, "we must unswervingly follow the party's mass 
line and give play to the initiative of all sectors of society," 
he said. 
  The establishment of a socialist market economic structure 
and the deepening of reforms have made it imperative to 
strengthen and improve party leadership and party building, and 
bring the role of party organizations and members into full 
play, he said. 
  He also called for efforts to train and promote younger 
officials so that they will be able to assume leading 
responsibilities beyond the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Speech delivered by Jiang Zemin at the National Conference </F>
on the Work To Assist the Poor in Development on 3 March 94: 
"Work To Assist the Poor in Development Should Be Carried Out 
Unswervingly and Persistently for a Long Period"] 
  [Text] I have visited quite a few impoverished areas in 
recent years. Generally speaking, as relatively close attention 
has been paid to the work of assisting the poor and developing 
the poverty-stricken areas, the work has been performed very 
well. Thanks to the intensified leadership of party committees 
and governments at all levels, the enthusiastic support of 
various departments and people from all walks of life, and the 
assiduous work of the vast numbers of cadres and masses, the 
population of poor people living in rural areas across the 
country who have not totally and steadily settled the problem of 
having adequate food and clothing has been reduced to 80 million 
at present. This is a tremendous, historic achievement. 
  In attaining this achievement, we have gained rich 
experiences, the most important of which, in my opinion, is that 
we have defined a new working principle under which the original 
pattern of assisting the poor by providing relief has been 
changed to giving assistance by way of development. Practice 
has proved that as the new principle is oriented to market 
demands and aimed at developing and utilizing local resources to 
boost commodity production through the application of scientific 
and technological advances, it will not only resolve the problem 
of providing people with adequate food and clothing, but enable 
people to get rid of poverty and become prosperous. In this 
way, very good results have been achieved in the production and 
development of the impoverished areas by integrating the 
assistance and support of the state with the self-reliance and 
hard work of the cadres and masses in light of actual local 
conditions. Just as many comrades have said: "The practice of 
assisting the poor by way of development has made people 
diligent, and the more diligent they are, the richer they 
become." I have been to Yanan Prefecture in Northern Shaanxi. 
People there built terraced fields to grow grain and resolved 
the problem of having enough food to eat. They also developed 
four major backbone industries -- tobacco, fruit, sheep, and 
potatoes, and resolved the problem of having money to spend. 
The apples produced there are very nice and have reached the 
export level. The principle of assisting the poor by way of 
development is a fundamental change as well as a momentous 
creation in this work, so it must be upheld for a long time to 
come. 
  The tasks faced by the work to assist the poor are still 
very 
arduous because 80 million people is not a small figure. 
Moreover, the areas which have extricated themselves from 
poverty over the past few years are those which have relatively 
less difficulty, and the remaining areas are some hard nuts to 
crack, as you have put it. In order to resolve the problem of 
having adequate food and clothing for these 80 million people in 
the next seven years, the State Council has formulated a "State 
Plan for Storming the Fortified Positions During the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan." This is a good and encouraging plan, but the 
key to its success lies in whether or not we have the spirit of 
assaulting fortifications. When we resolve the problem of 
having adequate food and clothing for the 80 million people by 
the end of this century, the right to subsistence -- the biggest 
and most fundamental issue of human rights -- of the Chinese 
people, who account for one-fourth of the world population, will 
be resolved once and for all from then on. This is not only a 
great event in the history of the Chinese nation, but a 
magnificent feat in the history of human development. 
  Taken as a whole, the work to assist the poor has reaped 
remarkable results, but we are still facing very arduous tasks. 
Therefore, we must continue with the work conscientiously, 
unswervingly, and perseveringly for a long period of time. 
<H5>  1. We Must Further Our Understanding of the Arduousness and </H5>
Importance of the Work To Assist the Poor by Way of Development 
in Order To Continue It for a Long Time 
  The arduousness of the work to assist the poor by way of 
development can be understood from the following two aspects: 
1) It is very difficult to fulfill the tasks set in the plan of 
storming the fortified positions during the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan, so great efforts are necessary; and 2) even if we fulfill 
the tasks set in the above-mentioned plan, we will only resolve 
the problem of absolute poverty, so we must continue to resolve 
the problem of relative poverty. As our burden is heavy and the 
road is long, we have to work hard for a long time. Today, 
although the average income in some developed countries is very 
high, some people still receive low pay and their problem of 
being relatively poor has not been resolved. Ours is a 
socialist country, and our goal is to achieve common prosperity 
for the entire people. Hence, our work to assist the poor is 
not an expedient measure but must be continued in for a long 
time. 
  Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the 
intrinsic requirements of socialism, which also reflects the 
superiority of the socialist system. Our party has been leading 
the people to make revolution and build socialism for the 
purpose of liberating and developing the productive forces and 
enabling people to become prosperous. Since reform and opening 
up, we have allowed and encouraged some people and localities to 
get rich first in the hope that they will contribute to helping 
other people and localities become rich too. In this way, we 
can more effectively reach the goal of achieving common 
prosperity. In developing the socialist market economic 
structure, we should pursue the goal of allocating resources 
efficiently, and at the same time give consideration to the 
principle of fairness. We should adopt feasible policies to 
foster development in the impoverished areas. 
  Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the 
requirements of reform and development as well as the essential 
conditions for maintaining stability. Development in various 
localities is uneven. It is quicker in some localities and 
relatively slower in others. This is inevitable. In this 
process, however, constant attention should be paid to the 
economic development in the impoverished areas. If these areas 
are always in a state of poverty, they will affect not only the 
realization of the objectives of our socialist modernization, 
but also the stability of the entire country. If people in some 
places are very rich and in other places are very poor for a 
long time, there will be latent unstable factors. At present, a 
considerable number of impoverished areas in China are mainly in 
the border regions and the regions where minority nationalities 
live in compact communities. Helping these areas rid themselves 
of poverty as quickly as possible and achieve common development 
is an economic issue as well as a major political issue that has 
a bearing on national unity, unification of the motherland, and 
consolidation of frontier defense. Moreover, some old liberated 
areas are still poverty-stricken. The people in the old 
liberated areas made tremendous contributions to the Chinese 
revolution in the war years, so it is our bounden duty to do a 
good job of assisting the poor in these areas in order to 
gradually improve the people's lives there. In short, the 
development of the old liberated areas, ethnic minority areas, 
border areas, impoverished areas, and western areas is an 
important issue that has an impact on the maintenance of a 
lasting good order in the country. 
<H5>  2. To Continue the Work for a Long Time, the Key Lies in </H5>
the Intensification of Party and Government Leadership at All 
Levels 
  The work to assist the poor is not purely economic work, but 
work engaged in by the masses with distinct political content 
covering the building of material and spiritual civilizations. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should, as 
always, make further efforts to intensify leadership in this 
work. 
  The principal leaders of party committees and governments at 
all levels must concern themselves with the work to assist the 
poor, take up the matter personally, and regard it as a major 
activity to show concern for the sufferings of the masses and 
cement close ties with them. Meanwhile, they must rely on the 
masses, consider everything in their interests, and work 
sincerely for their well-being. This is the fundamental aim of 
our party. In the areas where the economy has developed 
relatively slowly and the masses' lives have been relatively 
difficult, it is all the more necessary for party committees and 
governments at all levels to show special concern for them. 
Whether or not a party committee or government in a region has 
been divorced from the masses, and stability and unity have been 
maintained there, will primarily be judged by whether or not it 
has properly performed the work for the masses whose lives and 
production are comparatively difficult. The principal leaders 
of party committees and governments at all levels must take 
account of the overall situation, focus their work on the weak 
links, and go often to the impoverished areas and ethnic 
minority regions to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses, 
conduct investigation and study, and personally help the cadres 
and masses resolve practical problems. Recently, the idea has 
occurred to me that, since people in large and medium-sized 
cities and economically developed regions have comparatively 
ampler clothes and quilts, while those in impoverished areas are 
short of clothing and covering to ward off the cold, can we not 
mobilize government functionaries and urban residents, in the 
spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance, to donate 
their surplus clothes and quilts to the masses in the 
impoverished areas before the arrival of the coming winter? 
  We should persist in selecting and sending cadres to work in 
the impoverished areas by stages and in groups. Our experience 
in practice has fully proved that this is an indispensable 
organizational measure to strengthen leadership in the work to 
assist the poor by way of development, because the more 
impoverished an area is, the greater its necessity for obtaining 
assistance and guidance from its higher authority. Therefore, 
we should transfer a number of cadres from provincial, 
prefectural, and county organs to stay in poverty-hit townships 
and villages and conduct propaganda on party policies in a bid 
to help them set up powerful leading bodies, discover a correct 
path for shaking off poverty to become prosperous, import talent 
and technology, and enlist the masses in their production and 
development. If competent cadres cannot be found in some poor 
villages for the moment, we may try to transfer some cadres from 
the county organs to work there. The practice of constantly 
sending cadres to stay and work in poor villages is also of 
great benefit to tempering cadres, training talented personnel, 
and changing the work style in the leading bodies of party 
organizations and governments. We should take the achievements 
in changing the backward appearance of poverty-hit townships and 
villages as a major aspect in the appraisal and promotion of 
leading cadres at township and county levels. 
  Party committees and governments at all levels should be 
adept in mobilizing and enlisting forces from various quarters 
to initiate a new situation of assisting the poor and succoring 
the distressed in the entire society, which is also an important 
substance of intensifying leadership in the work. The Chinese 
nation always has a traditional virtue of assisting the poor and 
succoring the distressed. Today, in establishing a socialist 
market economy, it is particularly necessary to develop this 
traditional virtue. All units, including government organs, the 
People's Liberation Army, democratic parties, mass 
organizations, enterprises, and institutions, where conditions 
exist, should exert themselves to the utmost to give positive 
support to and participate in the work to assist the poor as 
they have done before. A certain financial input is necessary 
for the work, so financial, banking, and other departments 
should extend their support by providing funds and preferential 
treatment for this endeavor. We should also encourage the more 
economically developed areas to give assistance to the backward 
areas and, through mutually beneficial and reciprocal support, 
achieve common development and prosperity. I hope that the 
three municipalities, comprising Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, 
as well as various coastal provinces will put in a bit more 
effort in this. The central authorities are of the opinion that 
the relatively developed coastal provinces and cities should 
assist the impoverished areas in their localities with their own 
money, while funds for this purpose in the hands of the central 
authorities should chiefly be used in helping the central and 
western regions, which are in greater financial difficulty. In 
the meantime, we call on you to help support the impoverished 
areas in the central and western regions through such forms as 
economic cooperation, technological transfers, cadre exchange, 
and so on. Local party committees at all levels should 
positively launch activities in their own localities, through 
which rich counties offer help to poor counties, rich townships 
help poor townships, rich villages help poor villages, and rich 
households help poor households, so that they are formed into 
pairs for mutual assistance. 
  3. It Is Necessary for the Cadres and Masses in the 
Impoverished Areas To Fully Develop the Spirit of Self-Reliance 
and Hard Struggle for Pioneering a Cause In Order To Persist in 
the Work for a Long Time 
  It is absolutely necessary for the state to give certain 
assistance to the impoverished areas and for the people from all 
walks of life in society to conduct activities of assisting the 
poor and succoring the distressed. However, settling the 
problem of having adequate food and clothing in impoverished 
areas and proceeding to shake off poverty and become prosperous 
should, after all, depend on their own efforts. This calls for 
the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the impoverished areas 
to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to 
combat nature and boost economy. With this spirit of working 
hard to pioneer a cause, it will be easier to surmount any 
difficulty. This is a fine tradition of our party as well as 
the basic experience of our endeavor to shake off poverty and 
become prosperous. I went to inspect work in Shanxi Province 
during the Spring Festival last year. In Qiaoli Village, Linfen 
City, the people there have changed the appearance of a poor 
village precisely on the strength of pioneering a cause with 
hard work. Although the villagers have become wealthy now, the 
party branch still stands together with the masses through storm 
and stress, and shares weal and woe with them. I hope that all 
the people in impoverished areas will emulate and develop this 
spirit. 
  To persist in self-reliance and hard struggle, we must bring 
forth new ideas of assisting the poor through development. We 
must extricate ourselves from the shackles of traditional 
concepts and force of habit so that we will carry out reform, 
open to the outside world, and invigorate the economy in a 
practical manner, for which the crux lies in emancipating the 
mind and discovering a correct path. Quite a few impoverished 
areas are at a disadvantage because they failed to emancipate 
their minds, so that their path of economic development was too 
narrow. On the one hand, the barren hills and slopes were left 
uncultivated and the deserted shoals and water resources lay 
waste and, on the other, large numbers of the labor force 
remained idle. We must regard the labor force as our wealth 
rather than our burden. In many localities, the labor force was 
enlisted to reclaim land, build fields, construct bridges and 
roads, develop small irrigation works, and plant trees all the 
year round, so that remarkable results have been scored. 
Likewise, satisfactory results have also been reaped over the 
past few years in carrying out the policy of providing relief 
with grain and manufactured goods in exchange for the work of 
creating land and building roads, which has proved to be 
successful and should continue persistently. As farmland is 
limited but barren hills are numerous in the impoverished areas, 
forestry, animal husbandry, fruit, and cash crops should be 
developed in line with local conditions. "With animal husbandry 
developed here and forestry boosted there, the labor force was 
well utilized and economic results were instantly produced." 
This is also experience gained in the impoverished areas. The 
export of labor is, in essence, personnel training and 
intellectual development, because laborers will broaden their 
horizons and increase their knowledge after a few years of work 
in other places, and they will become talented people when they 
return. The current issue regarding the export of labor is: In 
face of the increasingly larger scale of "waves of migrant 
workers," we must intensify leadership and management of them to 
reduce the spontaneous blind flow as quickly as possible, while 
vigorously encouraging the export of labor in an organized and 
planned fashion. Party committees and governments at all 
levels, particularly those in the impoverished areas, should pay 
serious attention to this and sum up experience conscientiously. 
Otherwise, it will adversely affect the export of labor and 
bring about serious social consequences as well. 
  The key to persisting in self-reliance and hard struggle 
rests with the proper training of qualified personnel. To 
transform the pioneering spirit into a material force, we must 
ultimately depend on the intelligence and wisdom of the 
laborers. Therefore, we must place the work of assisting the 
poor through the development of science, education, and 
intellect in a primary position. The Eighth Five-Year Plan 
stresses the need to make elementary education universal, 
positively eliminate illiteracy, conduct vocational and 
technical education among young and middle-aged people, prevent 
and cure endemic diseases, and take firm control of family 
planning work. All this is very good, so I am all for it. In 
impoverished areas, we should stabilize the existing qualified 
personnel on the one hand, and bring up new talents on the 
other. Practice in many places shows that by using an excellent 
talent, a number of people will be motivated, and this locality 
will prosper. We should extend assistance to the rural party 
organizations politically, show concern for them, and unite and 
encourage them to lead the masses in changing the appearance of 
their hometowns and shaking off poverty to become rich. 
  Whether or not the spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle, 
and pioneering a cause will be brought into full play depends, 
to a considerable extent, on whether or not the leading bodies 
in the impoverished areas are really up to the mark and the 
grass-roots organizations are staunch. There are two focal 
points here: 1) We should enhance the work in impoverished 
counties and, in light of the requirement for assisting the poor 
by way of development, select and assign competent leading 
cadres at county level. In particular, we should select fine 
cadres who are capable in work, able to bear hardships and stand 
hard work, and have close ties with the masses to take up the 
posts of county party committee secretaries and county chiefs, 
and to remain in these positions for relatively long periods. 
2) We should reinforce the building of party branches in 
impoverished villages. "We give money and things to them all 
for the purpose of building up good party branches," which is 
another good experience we have gained in the work to assist the 
poor. In order to build good leading bodies in party branches, 
we must select fine party members who are active, capable, 
honest, fair, and able to cement close ties with the masses to 
take up the leading posts. 
  In short, with the necessary support from the state and the 
help from various sectors in society, so long as our leading 
cadres at all levels always have the impoverished areas in mind, 
share joys and sorrows with the masses, stick to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, base themselves in 
reality, persist in the struggle, and stress actual results in 
their endeavor to assist the poor by way of development, the 
backward appearance of the impoverished areas will certainly be 
changed before the turn of this century.

<F P=106> ["China Executies Four Cigarette Smugglers"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Four Chinese smugglers, 
including one government official and three frontier police 
officers, were executed this morning in Shandong and Guangdong 
provinces for two separate cases, a top judge said today. 
  Another criminal named Wang Jianzhi, former party chief of 
Rushan City of east China's Shandong Province, was sentenced to 
death with a two-year reprieve for harboring smugglers and 
taking bribes of 221,000 yuan, said Zhu Mingshan, vice-president 
of the Supreme People's Court, at a press conference here today. 
  Liu Qishan, Fan Zhanwu and Liu Ning from Shandong Province 
were condemned to death with political rights deprived for life 
for illegally transporting 9,900 packing boxes of cigarettes, 
taking bribes of 62,000 yuan, 154,000 yuan and 258,000 yuan 
respectively, and offering bribes. 
  Liu Qishan was head of the Commerce Bureau of Rushan City, 
Fan Zhanwu was political commissar of the frontier subbureau of 
the Weihai Police Bureau, and Liu Ning was an officer under Fan. 
  Yang Mingji, a former frontier officer in coastal Zhuhai 
City 
of Guangdong, was sentenced to death for ordering his staff to 
provide armed escorts for cigarette traffickers four times in 
March last year from Macao, smuggling 2,300 packing boxes of 
cigarettes, worth 5.18 million yuan, and taking escort fees of 
172,000 yuan with 48,200 yuan pocketed by himself. 
  Zhu said the Rushan crime was committed by the Rushan 
Commerce Bureau, a state organization, with smugglers and 
officers of law enforcement bodies collaborating, using armed 
escorts and protection from local officials. 
  The Rushan Commerce Bureau was fined 100,000 yuan for the 
crimes of smuggling and bribing. 
  According to Zhu, the Rushan crime story began when the 
frontier subbureau of the Weihai Police Bureau issued a 
regulation contrary to existing laws in July last year. It 
stipulated that state functionaries or enterprises involving 
smuggling would be "fined without having their original capital 
confiscated," provided they "confessed voluntarily" to the 
bureau. The frontier subbureau was surreptitiously encouraging 
the Rushan Commerce Bureau to smuggle cigarettes from south 
China. 
  Once he knew that the smuggling vessel was on the sea, Liu 
"confessed immediately" to the Weihai Frontier Subbureau. Fan 
ordered his four staff members, armed with machine guns, to 
receive it. 
  At Liu's request, two police heads from Rushan led more than 
20 staff members and three police cars to the port to meet the 
vessel, to "maintain order." 
  They refused inspections by customs officers, who later left 
for fear of armed conflicts. 6,900 packing boxes of cigarettes 
were unloaded and sold immediately, with a portion of the 
illegal cargo left behind for investigation by relevant 
departments. 
  After being informed of the case, former Rushan City Party 
Chief Wang did not press for a further probe, but covered up the 
criminals' activities with false statements in ensuing 
investigations. 
  The verdicts by the local courts of Weihai and Zhuhai have 
been upheld by the higher people's courts of Shandong and 
Guangdong and approved by the Supreme People's Court, the top 
judge said. 
  Zhu said China has cracked a number of smuggling cases and 
severely punished the smugglers in its anti-smuggling campaign 
since last August. 
  He described these two cases as "typical" of the smuggling 
wave the government is battling, with crimes characterized by 
involvement of "a considerable number" of legal persons, such as 
state agencies, organizations and enterprises, with huge amounts 
of state funds siphoned off, bringing extremely harmful 
consequences to the state and society. 
  Another feature reflected in the crimes is the collusion 
between smugglers and law enforcement officers, Zhu said, adding 
that such link-ups by a small number of people have played a 
growing role in setting off rampant smuggle activities. 
  "Local protectionism and departmental cover-ups are an 
important root of the malignant and prevailing crime," Zhu said, 
warning that "those still adhering to such ideas will swallow 
what they have sown." 
  The vice-president pledged that the people's court will 
continue to severely punish smugglers according to law, 
especially in what he called the "major and important" cases, to 
guarantee the progress of the country's reform, opening up, and 
economic development.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Full Text of Jiang Zemin Speech at </F>
Meeting With Third Group of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (TA KUNG PAO)--President Jiang 
Zemin today met with the third group of Hong Kong affairs 
advisers and newly appointed members of the Preliminary Work 
Committee [PWC]. Jiang Zemin made a speech, the full text of 
which is as follows: 
  Time flies like an arrow, and the sun and the moon move back 
and forth like shuttles. Today is only three years away from 
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and many 
urgent things remain to be done. 
  The central authorities have already formulated a series of 
important principles and polices toward the management of Hong 
Kong after 1997. Ten years ago, Deng Xiaoping said to us 
earnestly: We must believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can 
properly manage Hong Kong. Not believing that the Chinese have 
the ability to manage Hong Kong properly is a type of thinking 
left behind by old colonialism. We are fully confident that the 
Hong Kong people can manage Hong Kong well. He said that Hong 
Kong's current economic stability and prosperity is inseparable 
from the Hong Kong people's diligence and creative spirit. It 
was like this in the past, it is like this today, and the Hong 
Kong people are certainly able to create a good future for Hong 
Kong tomorrow. 
  There is an old saying which goes: "Bone is linked to 
muscle," that is, Hong Kong's stability and prosperity is 
closely linked to and inseparable from the economic development 
on our mainland and interior, and I am afraid that the mainland 
still must give great support to the many economic activities in 
Hong Kong. But Hong Kong will remain different from the 
mainland in the years to come, and Hong Kong will enjoy a high 
degree of autonomy and will be different from the 30 provinces 
and municipalities on the mainland. We must also realize, 
however, that the mainland, with its socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, gives great support to Hong Kong's one country, 
two systems, to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and to 
Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy. 
  In the next three years, the British Hong Kong authorities 
will still be in charge. But the Hong Kong people must begin 
participating today. One of the important reasons why we have 
founded the PWC and have appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers is 
to provide opportunities and channels for the Hong Kong people 
to participate in the undertaking of Hong Kong's return and 
smooth transition, and to lay a foundation for "Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He [as published] expressed the 
hope that the Hong Kong people would care about the matter of 
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and would care 
about Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, for these 
are closely linked to the interests of the Hong Kong people. He 
[as published] hoped that the Hong Kong affairs advisers and the 
members of the PWC would strengthen ties with the interior 
through various channels and do a better job in involving the 
Hong Kong people in the process of making full preparations for 
the approach of 1997. 
  I wish everyone trouble-free work and good health.

  [Text] Two exiled Chinese scholars living in the United 
States have been refused visas to attend a seminar in Hong Kong. 
  Liu Binyen and Ruan Ming, who went to the U.S. in 1988, were 
to come to Hong Kong at the beginning of next month to speak at 
a seminar organised by the Democratic University, an 
organisation preaching democratic theory. 
  Both men have been told by British consular officials in New 
York that their visa applications have been rejected. 
  Liu was told by the consul ate on Wednesday that his visa 
application had failed. He was not given any explanation. 
  Liu and Ruan said they both had U.S. re-entry permits -- a 
travel document issued by the U.S. government to enable green 
card holders to travel abroad. 
  Ruan, who was secretary to the former secretary-general of 
the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, and a visiting scholar 
at Columbia University, said he obtained his re-entry permit on 
May 18 and went to the British consulate two days later. 
  A British official told him they had been informed by the 
Hong Kong Immigration Department that his Chinese passport had 
expired, so he would not be given a visa. 
  Both Liu and Ruan believe they were not granted visas 
because 
of pressure from China, which has repeatedly warned against Hong 
Kong becoming a "subversive base". 
  "This shows that the Hong Kong government's deceptive and 
cynical nature is the same as the Chinese government's," Ruan 
said. 
  "They only want to please the Chinese authorities. 
  "It is an act of duplicity and double standards, violating 
both the freedom of academic exchange and human rights. 
  "This is a bitter irony to Chris Patten's political reform 
and his calls for freedom. Even before 1997, Britain is already 
conniving with China to abuse people's rights." 
  Liu, a renowned journalist, said this incident meant China 
was taking over Hong Kong even before 1997. He said he believed 
his application was rejected because his visit coincided with 
the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  A senior government official denied last night the territory 
had succumbed to pressure from Beijing. "We are determined not 
to turn Hong Kong into a subversive base or a platform for the 
engagement of subversive activities," the official said. 
  "Why don't they give their speech in New York or Paris?" 
  On Wednesday, China attacked Hong Kong for allowing the 
exiled dissident Han Dongfang to remain in the territory. 
Another dissident, Wuer Kaixi, has also scheduled a visit to 
the territory for next month.

  [Text] Key advisers to Beijing say the Hong Kong 
Government is headed for smoother relations with the mainland 
following the move to stop two dissidents entering the 
territory. Pro-Beijing legislator and Preliminary Working 
Committee member Tam Yiu-chung said Hong Kong's relationship 
with Beijing would be helped by keeping out people China 
believed were subversive. 
  The British Consulate-General in New York last week rejected 
visa applications for Hong Kong from Liu Binyin and Ruan Ming to 
attend a seminar coinciding with the fifth anniversary of 
Beijing's June 4 crackdown at Tiananmen Square. The United 
States-exiled Chinese said the consulate had refused them visas 
on instructions from Hong Kong's Immigration Department. 
  Mr Tam said the move would help a smooth transition to 
Chinese rule in 1997. "Sino-British relations would be improved 
if Hong Kong keeps out people who China feels are subversive or 
antagonistic towards the mainland," Mr Tam said. 
  Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress Liu 
Yiu-chu said the government's decision to refuse visas was due 
to the need to cooperate with China for a smooth transition. Ms 
Liu attacked the two dissidents for trying to "rock" Hong Kong 
by importing "their political fight." 
  Exiled Mr Liu earned notoriety for revealing government 
corruption as a People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] reporter. Mr Ruan 
was secretary to former Chinese Communist Party general 
secretary Hu Yaobang, whose death in May 1989 triggered the 
Tiananmen protests. 
  While pro-Beijing groups welcome the government's stand, 
Governor Chris Patten is set to come under fire from liberal 
legislators when he returns to Hong Kong this week. Several 
said they would raise the issue at the Legislative Council on 
Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Independent legislator Christine Loh said she was not 
surprised at the visa rejection as the territory had a history 
of turning away "subversives". Ms Loh argued the "one country, 
two systems" concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong may 
disappear as China tries to dictate to Hong Kong. 
  Independent legislator Emily Lau said she could not 
understand why the two exiled scholars were refused entry. 
"They're not raving subversives. It's quite ridiculous," Ms 
Lau said. 
  Last Thursday Acting Governor Anson Chan said Hong Kong 
should not be used as a base for subversive activities for the 
June 4 anniversary. Last week China revealed a softening stance 
towards Hong Kong by indicating its willingness to allow four 
foreigners to sit as judges on the territory's Court of Final 
Appeal.

  [Text] Sensitivity surrounding this week's anniversary of 
the events in Tiananmen Square forced the government to refuse 
entry to Chinese dissidents wanting to visit Hong Kong, Governor 
Chris Patten said. He defended the government's decision to ban 
two Chinese scholars--Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming--from attending 
June 4 commemorative activities in Hong Kong. 
  Mr Patten said people should not be allowed to use the 
territory to criticize what is happening elsewhere at "sensitive 
moments." His comments implied that the government would 
consider a further ban on Chinese dissidents during other 
politically sensitive periods. "I think there is a difference 
between the freedoms that we all exercise here and at sensitive 
moments," he said on his return from Britain. "There are just 
some moments--you know it as well--which are more sensitive than 
others." 
  The two outspoken Chinese dissidents, who are now in the 
United States, were reportedly denied visas by the British 
Consulate in New York upon the Hong Kong Government's 
instruction. 
  Mr Patten also rejected comments by Chinese officials who 
attacked the government for allowing exiled labour activist Han 
Dongfang to stay in the territory. "It's a problem they have 
created, not us," Mr Patten said. 
  Mr Han was refused entry into China when attempting to 
return 
home last year.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Stresses That Stability and </F>
Prosperity Have Become Targets Sought by Young People"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the 
Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: Mainland and 
Hong Kong young people are most concerned about social 
stability. The Beijing storm which took place five years ago 
has become history, and history has come to a conclusion on 
this; we should not get entangled in this issue. 
  Zhang Junsheng believes that social stability and economic 
prosperity are the common wish of Hong Kong compatriots. In 
answer to a reporter's question while attending the anniversary 
of Zhongshan University's [in Guangzhou] law students alumnus in 
Hong Kong yesterday, Zhang Junsheng indicated that from a survey 
published in a Hong Kong newspaper conducted among Beijing, 
Guangzhou, and Hong Kong youths, he learned that Beijing, 
Guangzhou, and Hong Kong youths are most concerned about social 
stability and then a society with a legal system. Zhang 
Junsheng added that what Hong Kong people need now is a stable 
society, and he believes that Hong Kong citizens favor social 
stability and economic prosperity most. Stability and 
prosperity are the wish of the Hong Kong people. 
  When a reporter asked whether the Hong Kong Government's 
refusal of Liu Binyan's entry into the territory was the result 
of pressure from the Chinese side, Zheng Junsheng replied that 
the reporter should ask the Hong Kong Government.

  [Text] A march to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre ended with minor scuffles yesterday 
after police blocked access to the Xinhua (New China News 
Agency) headquarters. 
  The confrontation came after a three-hour march in which 
protesters demanded redress for the suffering of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement, labelled a "counter-revolutionary riot" 
by mainland authorities. 
  More than 3,000 people -- about half last year's number -- 
gathered outside Chater Garden and walked along Queensway and 
Hennessy Road to Causeway Bay, then to the Xinhua offices in 
Happy Valley. 
  A core member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the 
Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Cheung Man-kwong, said 
he believed people still had a strong passion for the movement. 
  Accompanied by alliance leader Szeto Wah and other key 
members including Mak Hoi-wah and Yeung Sum, Mr Cheung led the 
group in calling for the release of political dissidents in 
China and singing patriotic songs. 
  When the group reached the Queen Elizabeth Stadium opposite 
the Xinhua office, the police allowed 20 representatives to 
cross Queen's Road East to hand in a petition. 
  Barricades kept people back about 1.5 metres from the main 
entrance. 
  Alliance representatives were allowed to send only one 
person 
beyond the barricades to place the petition at the main gate. 
  They were not allowed to place a wreath and black banner on 
the doorstep. 
  Alliance leaders decided to stage a sit-in until the police 
yielded. 
  However, scuffles broke out when another demonstrator, Wong 
Kin, rushed the police line in the middle of Queen's Road East, 
attempting to join the alliance members. 
  He and a second protester were restrained and some 
photographers were pulled away by policemen. 
  The incident sparked allegations that human rights had been 
violated and that the Government might be bowing to Chinese 
pressure to suppress the demonstration. 
  Mr Cheung, also a legislator, said it was ridiculous for the 
police to insist that only the articles specified in the 
petition licence could be placed at the Xinhua entrance. 
  He questioned the legal basis on which the police had barred 
them from placing the flowers and banner on the footpath. 
  But Wan Chai District Commander Harold Bludd said the police 
were right in imposing the restriction. 
  "They do not have a permit to do it. That's why. They have 
a permit to hand in a petition. That's all," he said. 
  "It was not agreed that they would bring a flower cart, it 
was not agreed that they would bring their banners. There was 
no agreement that they would put them in front of the NCNA (New 
China News Agency) main entrance," Mr Bludd said.

  [Text] Police abused their discretionary right to ban 
petitions composed of unspecified materials during Sunday's 
demonstration outside the Xinhua News Agency, representatives of 
the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic 
Movement in China said yesterday. 
  Police clashed with a small number of demonstrators outside 
the Xinhua building when they tried to prevent Alliance members 
from placing a wreath and a banner in front of the entrance. A 
police spokesman defended their decision as one of "safety" and 
"to minimise inconvenience to the public". 
  And Governor Chris Patten defended the police, saying they 
behaved with a "good degree of tact." "These are not easy 
matters for the police, but I think from all I've heard... they 
behaved sensibly. Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are 
guaranteed under the Joint Declaration and we'll certainly do 
everything we can before 1997 to ensure the foundations for 
those freedoms are as secured as possible." 
  Alliance spokesman and United Democrat legislator Cheung 
Man-kwong said bringing along items in addition to the letter 
which was specified in the condition for the permit was a usual 
practice. He said that last year the group set five flags in 
front of the Xinhua building without any harassment from police. 
Mr Cheung said he was told Xinhua had expressed unhappiness 
over having items placed in front of its entrance. "The police 
have used their discretion to bow to the authorities," he said. 
  Asked whether items used in petitions should be specified in 
conditions for permits Mr Cheung said it would be "absurd" to go 
into such detail. 
  A police spokesman said the primary concern was the safety 
of 
demonstrators the public. "Those attending processions and 
demonstrations must heed police advice and directions for their 
own safety and to minimise inconvenience to other members of the 
public," he said.

<F P=106> [By Fung Wai-Kong and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Six senior journalists in ATV's [Asia Television 
Limited] News and Public Affairs Department resigned yesterday 
after the station management rejected a documentary about the 
1989 Beijing massacre. At least two other reporters indicated 
they were also ready to resign from the team of about 50 
covering Chinese and English channels. 
  Those who submitted their resignations yesterday were newly- 
appointed Acting News Controller Poon Fu-yin, Assistant News 
Controller Selina Li Yuklin, Executive Editor Lo Wing-hung, 
Managing Editor Lui Wan-sang, Assignment Editor Choy Pui-ying 
and City Editor Lau Kok-wa. 
  The news division had planned to include a Spanish 
documentary in the News Magazine programme on the Home Channel 
on June 3 to mark the fifth anniversary of the massacre. The 
programme contains film which seemed to support the long-held 
Chinese position that there was no killing in Tiananmen Square 
when People's Liberation Army troops crushed the pro-democracy 
movement with tanks and rifles. The massacre has become known as 
the Tiananmen Square incident, even though it is widely accepted 
that most of the deaths occurred in the streets around the 
square. 
  The management last Saturday ordered that a short segment 
promoting the film be taken off the air. Executives reportedly 
told news staff that as five years had already passed since the 
massacre, it did nobody any good to look back at the issue and 
that one should be prospective rather than retrospective. 
  According to one ATV journalist the decision was "very sad 
and disappointing." "This is only 1994, still three years 
before the handover and yet media owners and senior managers 
have begun to do things like that. It's a very sad thing. The 
decision actually leaves no choice for the news management 
staff. It is extremely difficult for them to remain in their 
posts when the news department no longer enjoys editorial 
independence." 
  He emphasised that the resignation of the senior staff was 
not a bargaining tactic, but rather a strong disapproval of the 
decision. "We hope this action will alert the public to the 
growing gag on the news media and to discourage other media from 
taking the same path." 
  It is understood management will meet staff today. 
  ATV management denied any knowledge of the controversy. 
  Assistant Controller of ATV's Public Relations and Publicity 
Department Lu Fung said she had not heard of the resignations 
and so was unable to comment on the issue. She added that she 
was unable to contact the station's senior management. Deputy 
Chief Executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who has overall control 
of the news division, was unavailable for comment last night. 
  The ATV newsroom is still recovering from a major shakeup a 
fortnight ago. The Assistant Chief Executive Timothy Jim and 
News Controller Garman Chan left their posts on May 16, soon 
after Mr Chang was appointed. 
  Independent legislator and a vocal supporter of press 
freedom, Emily Lau Wai-hing, said she was astonished by the 
decision which she felt was an indication that ATV was imposing 
self-censorship on sensitive programmes. She warned that the 
credibility of the company would suffer as a result of this 
incident. Rejecting the explanation that the programme was 
undesirable because five years had gone by since the massacre, 
Ms Lau said: "This is unacceptable. On Sunday we had thousands 
of people out on the streets to commemorate the incident." 
  She said it was ridiculous for ATV to make such a decision 
only a day after the company's representative criticised rival 
TVB for blocking a documentary on the private life of Mao 
Zedong. She called for an explanation from ATV management and 
asked that the journalists who resigned reveal the background to 
the incident. 
  The Journalists' Association was last night trying to 
contact 
ATV staff and would not comment. 
  Prominent Hong Kong-based activist Lau Shan-ching said: "It 
is a clear evidence of commercial interest taking precedence 
over journalistic ideals." 
  Recently television companies had been stepping up efforts 
to 
expand their market into the mainland and they also benefit 
substantially from advertisement of China's property market, he 
said. It was only natural that they feared offending their 
financial sources in broadcasting the sensitive documentary. 
  Admitting that it was inevitable, he said the only effective 
way to prevent the event from happening was to enact laws to 
prevent interference from journalistic judgment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sad For Press Freedom"] </F>
  [Text] The resignation of senior news executives and 
journalists at ATV [Asia Television Limited] last night has 
brought the debate over self-censorship in the Hong Kong media 
into sharper focus. The phenomenon has often been discussed but 
rarely has there been such clear evidence of it happening. 
  The self-censorship at the territory's television stations 
has now got to the stage where material relating to sensitive 
subjects may be cut, even when it appears to reflect the 
official Beijing view. ATV's decision not to screen a film in 
commemoration of the June 4 massacre is illogical. There is 
even less logic in the decision made by ATV as it should know 
well that some material in the programme actually purported to 
show there were no killings on Tiananmen Square itself. 
  Self-censorship is not driven by logic. It is driven by 
fear. Its proponents are always having to second-guess the 
powers they are trying to impress. Braver organisations would 
be tempted to push the limits of Beijing's tolerance, attempting 
to see how far they can go without provoking an angry reaction. 
Paradoxically, silence from Beijing makes the self-censors more 
timid. When in doubt, runs their creed, cut it out. 
  Such timidity will be counterproductive in the end. The 
journalists who quit are not the only losers. The Hong Kong 
public are also deprived of a programme which after all may not 
be as offensive to Beijing leaders, who have occasionally shown 
flexibility, as ATV management thinks. The TV stations must 
recover their self-respect or they will drag others down with 
them. They should have the courage to broadcast sensitive, not 
malicious, material. Showing a documentary recording a 
historical event would not necessarily mean ATV is anti-Beijing. 
By choosing not to screen it, ATV has alienated and 
disappointed the public.

  [Text] Hefei, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The Huaihe River Valley, 
frequently hit by devastating flood and drought over past 
centuries, has been transformed into China's leading granary. 
  That was made possible by two massive campaigns in the past 
four decades to harness the Huaihe River, the fourth longest 
river in China. The campaigns involved an investment of 27.3 
billion yuan jointly by the central government and local 
governments in the valley, including 184 counties and cities 
within the jurisdiction of central China's Henan, east China's 
Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces. 
  The first campaign was launched in 1950 by the late Chairman 
Mao Zedong shortly after the Huaihe River overflowed in the 
summer of the year, causing heavy casualties. 
  The second one was waged by the central government in 1991 
following devastating floods in the valley which killed at least 
1,000 people and caused 32.7 billion yuan of direct losses. 
  China has decided on a plan to spend about 12 billion yuan 
during 1991-2000 on improving the valley's flood control ability 
as part of its efforts to harness the river. 
  As part of the campaigns, 5,300 reservoirs have been built, 
new rivers for the passage of flood water into the sea dug and 
many other flood control and irrigation facilities, such as 
pumping stations, set up. 
  The large-scale water conservancy construction has brought 
about fundamental changes to the region's agricultural 
production. 
  Water control and irrigation facilities have been improved 
for 65 percent of the region's total cultivated land, or nearly 
eight million ha [hectares], which used to be vulnerable to 
water-logging. 
  The yearly grain output for the valley exceeds 60 million 
tons, or an average of 428 kg per head of the 140 million people 
of the region, more than the region's total consumption. 
  So the region each year supplies about 16 million tons of 
grain to other parts of the country or for industrial purposes. 
  The northern Jiangsu plain within the valley -- 60 percent 
of 
Jiangsu Province's farmland, 2.93 million ha -- used to be a 
corridor for flood water, and floods occurred in the past in 
nine out of every ten years. 
  The frequent floods led to hunger and even massive uprisings 
in the region's history. 
  As a result of the establishment of the flood controls, 
irrigation systems and other water conservancy projects in the 
plain, the per unit yield in the plain doubled and the per 
capita grain output tripled. The improved flood-control and 
irrigation capacity has also boosted the production of fruit, 
tea and fresh-water aquatic products.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 13 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Having 
experienced the test of four price-rise peaks, including the one 
happening last year, though commodity prices still rose month by 
month in the first quarter of this year, Guangdong Province 
remained unalarmed in the face of "rising prices" and managed to 
regulate and control commodity prices in a steady and orderly 
way. 
  Following the relatively sharp price rises generated by 
grain 
price fluctuations last year, plus the influence of the 
"carry-on [qiao wei 5062 1442]" effect, Guangdong Province's 
commodity prices kept on climbing up in the first quarter of 
this year. Compared with the same period last year, the 
commodity retail price index in this period increased by 20.5 
percent or 0.4 percentage point higher than the country's 
average level. Therefore, there was still a considerable gap 
between this figure and the goal set last year by the provincial 
government to keep price rises at about 12 percent. 
  In the first of quarter of this year, Guangdong devoted 
efforts to strengthening the construction of the "shopping 
basket" and "rice bag" projects to ensure production and supply 
of the residents' basic daily necessities. In terms of the 
"rice bag" program, while stabilizing the area of land sown to 
grain crops, provincial financial departments allocated 150 
million yuan to build 50 grain-producing-base counties within 
three years starting from the beginning of this year, a grain 
reserve system and a 250-million-yuan system of risk funds for 
grain were set up, and the system of purchasing grain at the 
protective prices was further implemented. In the "shopping 
basket" program, continued efforts were made to stabilize and 
expand the "shopping basket" bases; Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, 
Shaoguan, and seven other cities established 
500-million-yuan-or-so funds for regulating and controlling 
prices of non-staple foods; and active efforts were made to open 
wholesale markets for agricultural and sideline products and 
market fairs, thus unclogging commodity channels. 
  At present, with the weakening of the "carry-on" effect and 
the strengthening of regulation and control, Guangdong's 
consumer goods prices, service charges, and capital goods prices 
have dropped considerably. In the capital goods market, supply 
has exceeded demand. The prices of daily-use consumer goods are 
staying at the late-1993 levels and the prices of some of them 
have steadied or gone down. Vegetable prices are relatively 
stable. According to a survey conducted by the Guangzhou City 
Statistics Bureau, compared with the previous month, the 
commodity price index in March dropped by 1.8 percentage point. 
  Today most fellow countrymen have some understanding of the 
"twin" relationship between economic growth rate and price 
rises. Perhaps it is easier for Guangdong people, who are market 
conscious, to comprehend the relationship. 
  Nevertheless, in terms of the overall picture of Guangdong's 
market prices in the first quarter of this year, as the factors 
generating price rises continue to expand in number, relevant 
departments dare not lower their guard. 
  Guangdong's price rises in the first quarter of this year 
were characterized by a high starting point and an overall rise 
with the prices of the residents' daily necessities and service 
charges staying high. During this period, the prices of food, 
books, and magazines and the charges for communications and 
medical and health-care services rose by over 20 percent, and 
recently they registered another rise of 5.4 percent. The 
general price rise in various cities of the province was 
universally quite high. Yangjiang, Heyuan, Qingyuan, and 
Zhanjiang Cities were among the cities with the highest 
price-rise levels. 
  According to relevant statistics, compared with the 
corresponding period last year, in the first quarter of this 
year, investments by state-owned units increased by 43.3 
percent, and total volume of consumer goods retail sales rose by 
33 percent. This helped push market prices up. At the same 
time, during the same period many major reform projects were 
carried out. This also served as an important reason behind 
price rises in Guangdong. According to calculations, the 
adoption of a new taxation system, the unification of foreign 
exchange rates, and the introduction of price reform alone have 
driven up the province's commodity prices by about four 
percentage points. In addition, man-made factors causing 
inflation, such as wanton raising of prices and wanton 
collection of fees, should not be ignored because they can make 
a stormy sea stormier. 
  Jiang Shanli, director of the Guangdong Provincial Commodity 
Price Bureau, summarized the province's market price situation 
into 15 characters reading: The situation is quite grim. 
Though facing great difficulties in regulating and controlling 
market prices, we have confidence in doing so. 
  It has been learned that relevant departments in the 
province 
are taking corresponding measures, such as increasing effective 
supplies, putting the scale of investment and credit under 
control, strengthening the monitoring of prices of the 
residents' daily necessities and service charges, and expediting 
the pace of pricing legislation, to achieve the government-set 
goal of price control for this year. 
  In the first quarter of this year, although Guangdong ranked 
ninth in the country from its previous middle and lower level in 
terms of price rises, people here believe that this does not 
mean that the province's commodity price situation will further 
deteriorate. On the contrary, although some hinterland 
provinces and cities may achieve marked results in the short 
term in their efforts to control prices by relying on 
administrative measures and financial subsidies, this practice 
can be called "drinking poisoned wine to quench the thirst." In 
relying on the superiority of its relatively high marketization 
level, Guangdong has upheld the dominant position of regulation 
by market mechanisms and placed great stress on developing 
production and invigorating circulation. From a long-term point 
of view, this way of doing things is undoubtedly a wise move.

  [Text] Jinan, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren has urged major state-owned enterprises to orient 
themselves with the market and play a leading role in the market 
economy being created nationwide. 
  During a tour of inspection of east China's Shandong 
Province 
from May 19 to 26, Rong said that the establishment of a market 
economy has afforded an excellent opportunity for such 
enterprises to develop themselves. 
  The enterprises have strengths in personnel, technology and 
equipment, he said, noting that some have set an example for 
others to follow in displaying these advantages fully. 
  He expressed the belief that workers and staff of such 
enterprises will certainly brace up and work even harder to 
invigorate their enterprises. 
  Local officials told the vice president that during the 
first 
four months of 1994, output value of major state-owned 
enterprises all over Shandong Province shot up 15 percent over 
the same period in 1993. 
  Profits and taxes generated by such enterprises jumped 20 
percent during that period. 
  "Reform is essential to the invigoration of major 
state-owned 
enterprises," Rong told local officials. 
  Specifically, such enterprises must introduce a modern 
enterprise system and a market-oriented operational mechanism by 
carrying out reforms in employment, personnel and income 
distribution, he noted. 
  The leader also stressed the need to arouse the initiative 
of 
workers and staff, develop and manufacture quality and 
marketable products and pursue a diverse economy as a way to 
provide jobs to surplus workers. 
  He called for efforts to promote scientific and 
technological 
progress. He did so while visiting the Jinan Motorcycle Plant, 
the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation, the North Star Wristwatch 
Factory and seven other companies in seven cities, as well as 
two economic and technological development zones in the cities 
of Yantai and Weihai. 
  "When possible, major enterprises should set up their own 
research institutes," he said, adding that practice will make it 
possible to speed up the upgrading of products and improve their 
competitiveness. 
  According to the vice president, the import of funds and 
technology, especially high and new technology, is a good way to 
retool major state-owned companies in China. 
  Rong Yiren also asked such companies to make full use of 
domestic scientific and technological findings.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Government Creates Body To Control Land </F>
Deals"] 
  [Text] The government has created a land valuers body to 
regulate land prices and deals across the country. 
  The China Real Estate Appraisers' Association (CREAA) was 
set 
up yesterday in Beijing to bring together professionals and 
control the country's fledgling land and real estate trade. 
  Government regulations governing the land have been flouted 
recently, with many State-owned plots being sold at a discount. 
  The State has had to bear these costs, complained the State 
Land Administration (SLA). 
  "Such problems cannot be solved completely by the government 
only, but have to be settled by relying on the co-ordination of 
qualified professionals," said Zou Yuchuan, top SLA official. 
  CREAA chairman, Wang Xianjin pledged that, with government 
support, his association "will evaluate land to be sold on 
market independently by using regulated professional methods 
that are in line with international practices today." 
  "Not only will CREAA evaluate urban land on the market 
according to the relevant regulations and laws, it will also 
introduce fair and practical evaluation methods that have proved 
successful in other parts of the world." Evaluation will be 
supervised by the SLA, Wang said. 
  More than 1,000 professional land appraisers from across the 
country, including top valuers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, 
have already joined the newly-established association, according 
to former SLA director Wang. 
  The setting up of the CREAA represents a major government 
move to control the State-owned urban land market and stamp out 
the illegal land deals and speculation, which led to the real 
estate profiteering of the last two years.

  [Text] Guiyang, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Guizhou Province, nicknamed the "park province" for its rich 
natural resources and its attractive folk arts and custom, 
received more than 100,000 overseas tourists and 16 million 
domestic visitors last year. 
  The province has eight national scenic spots and four nature 
reserves. It also has many ethnic groups with unique custom and 
traditions. 
  To improve the tourism environment high-quality highways 
have 
been built to link all the main scenic spots, and more than 20 
air routes have been opened from the provincial capital to other 
parts of China. More than 60 travel service companies have been 
established and 17 hotels accredited to accommodate foreign 
tourists have been built in the province. 
  The boom in tourism has brought not only a great amount of 
revenue to the province but has also made changes in many other 
local aspects, according to Yang Shengming, director of the 
provincial tourism administration. 
  Partly as a spinoff of tourism, the province has attracted 
more than 90 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, which 
has funded more than 820 joint ventures. 
  Meanwhile, local people have begun to learn to speak 
standard 
Chinese and foreign languages, and to do business. Economic and 
cultural exchanges with foreign countries have increased. 
  The provincial government has invited some tourism experts 
to 
help draw up an overall tourism development program for the 
province, according to a local official.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed have expressed a 
strong desire to improve bilateral trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  The two prime ministers said this in a recent exchange of 
letters to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of 
diplomatic relations by China and Malaysia, Foreign Ministry 
sources said today. 
  Premier Li said that the cooperation between China and 
Malaysia had made rapid progress on the basis of the five 
principles of coexistence since the establishment of diplomatic 
ties on May 31, 1974. 
  Li said that Mahathir's three visits to China in recent 
years 
had served to promote bilateral understanding and mutual trust, 
and that the good relations between the two countries would 
benefit their peoples and be conducive to promoting regional 
peace, stability and prosperity. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mahathir said in his letter that 
the development of the good relations between Malaysia and China 
was due to the Chinese leaders being pragmatic and favoring 
openness. 
  He said that China's policy of good neighborliness had 
allowed bilateral relations to develop rapidly. He also 
expressed the belief that the two countries would widen their 
cooperation not only in the fields of the economy, trade and 
investment but also in tourism, cultural exchange and 
people-to-people contact. 
  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his Malaysian 
counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi also exchanged letters marking 
the 20th anniversary of the opening of formal relations.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Full Text of Jiang Zemin Speech at </F>
Meeting With Third Group of Hong Kong Affairs Advisers"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (TA KUNG PAO)--President Jiang 
Zemin today met with the third group of Hong Kong affairs 
advisers and newly appointed members of the Preliminary Work 
Committee [PWC]. Jiang Zemin made a speech, the full text of 
which is as follows: 
  Time flies like an arrow, and the sun and the moon move back 
and forth like shuttles. Today is only three years away from 
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and many 
urgent things remain to be done. 
  The central authorities have already formulated a series of 
important principles and polices toward the management of Hong 
Kong after 1997. Ten years ago, Deng Xiaoping said to us 
earnestly: We must believe that the Chinese in Hong Kong can 
properly manage Hong Kong. Not believing that the Chinese have 
the ability to manage Hong Kong properly is a type of thinking 
left behind by old colonialism. We are fully confident that the 
Hong Kong people can manage Hong Kong well. He said that Hong 
Kong's current economic stability and prosperity is inseparable 
from the Hong Kong people's diligence and creative spirit. It 
was like this in the past, it is like this today, and the Hong 
Kong people are certainly able to create a good future for Hong 
Kong tomorrow. 
  There is an old saying which goes: "Bone is linked to 
muscle," that is, Hong Kong's stability and prosperity is 
closely linked to and inseparable from the economic development 
on our mainland and interior, and I am afraid that the mainland 
still must give great support to the many economic activities in 
Hong Kong. But Hong Kong will remain different from the 
mainland in the years to come, and Hong Kong will enjoy a high 
degree of autonomy and will be different from the 30 provinces 
and municipalities on the mainland. We must also realize, 
however, that the mainland, with its socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, gives great support to Hong Kong's one country, 
two systems, to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and to 
Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy. 
  In the next three years, the British Hong Kong authorities 
will still be in charge. But the Hong Kong people must begin 
participating today. One of the important reasons why we have 
founded the PWC and have appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers is 
to provide opportunities and channels for the Hong Kong people 
to participate in the undertaking of Hong Kong's return and 
smooth transition, and to lay a foundation for "Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He [as published] expressed the 
hope that the Hong Kong people would care about the matter of 
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and would care 
about Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, for these 
are closely linked to the interests of the Hong Kong people. He 
[as published] hoped that the Hong Kong affairs advisers and the 
members of the PWC would strengthen ties with the interior 
through various channels and do a better job in involving the 
Hong Kong people in the process of making full preparations for 
the approach of 1997. 
  I wish everyone trouble-free work and good health.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
met here today with Peter Chiu, managing director of the Hong 
Kong Health Food Enterprise Company, and his wife Cheung Yeuk 
Lee. 
  Chiu and his wife made the trip to donate six million yuan 
to 
build 100 primary schools in poor regions on the mainland. 
  Li spoke highly of the action and said that people around 
the 
country were paying great attention to education, one of the 
most important and outstanding problems in China now. 
  In recent years, Li said, many patriotic overseas Chinese 
and 
compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao have donated large amounts of 
money to help build schools in poor areas. The donors should be 
praised, he added. 
  He also expressed his hope that relevant departments on the 
mainland cooperate closely with donors and apply their donations 
to yield effective results. For instance, with support of the 
United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee, Taiwan entrepreneur Kander Lee's donation has 
achieved real results in development of education, he said. 
  The 100 schools underwritten by the couple, under 
arrangements by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese

  [Text] Two exiled Chinese scholars living in the United 
States have been refused visas to attend a seminar in Hong Kong. 
  Liu Binyen and Ruan Ming, who went to the U.S. in 1988, were 
to come to Hong Kong at the beginning of next month to speak at 
a seminar organised by the Democratic University, an 
organisation preaching democratic theory. 
  Both men have been told by British consular officials in New 
York that their visa applications have been rejected. 
  Liu was told by the consul ate on Wednesday that his visa 
application had failed. He was not given any explanation. 
  Liu and Ruan said they both had U.S. re-entry permits -- a 
travel document issued by the U.S. government to enable green 
card holders to travel abroad. 
  Ruan, who was secretary to the former secretary-general of 
the Chinese Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, and a visiting scholar 
at Columbia University, said he obtained his re-entry permit on 
May 18 and went to the British consulate two days later. 
  A British official told him they had been informed by the 
Hong Kong Immigration Department that his Chinese passport had 
expired, so he would not be given a visa. 
  Both Liu and Ruan believe they were not granted visas 
because 
of pressure from China, which has repeatedly warned against Hong 
Kong becoming a "subversive base". 
  "This shows that the Hong Kong government's deceptive and 
cynical nature is the same as the Chinese government's," Ruan 
said. 
  "They only want to please the Chinese authorities. 
  "It is an act of duplicity and double standards, violating 
both the freedom of academic exchange and human rights. 
  "This is a bitter irony to Chris Patten's political reform 
and his calls for freedom. Even before 1997, Britain is already 
conniving with China to abuse people's rights." 
  Liu, a renowned journalist, said this incident meant China 
was taking over Hong Kong even before 1997. He said he believed 
his application was rejected because his visit coincided with 
the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  A senior government official denied last night the territory 
had succumbed to pressure from Beijing. "We are determined not 
to turn Hong Kong into a subversive base or a platform for the 
engagement of subversive activities," the official said. 
  "Why don't they give their speech in New York or Paris?" 
  On Wednesday, China attacked Hong Kong for allowing the 
exiled dissident Han Dongfang to remain in the territory. 
Another dissident, Wuer Kaixi, has also scheduled a visit to 
the territory for next month.

  [Text] Key advisers to Beijing say the Hong Kong 
Government is headed for smoother relations with the mainland 
following the move to stop two dissidents entering the 
territory. Pro-Beijing legislator and Preliminary Working 
Committee member Tam Yiu-chung said Hong Kong's relationship 
with Beijing would be helped by keeping out people China 
believed were subversive. 
  The British Consulate-General in New York last week rejected 
visa applications for Hong Kong from Liu Binyin and Ruan Ming to 
attend a seminar coinciding with the fifth anniversary of 
Beijing's June 4 crackdown at Tiananmen Square. The United 
States-exiled Chinese said the consulate had refused them visas 
on instructions from Hong Kong's Immigration Department. 
  Mr Tam said the move would help a smooth transition to 
Chinese rule in 1997. "Sino-British relations would be improved 
if Hong Kong keeps out people who China feels are subversive or 
antagonistic towards the mainland," Mr Tam said. 
  Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress Liu 
Yiu-chu said the government's decision to refuse visas was due 
to the need to cooperate with China for a smooth transition. Ms 
Liu attacked the two dissidents for trying to "rock" Hong Kong 
by importing "their political fight." 
  Exiled Mr Liu earned notoriety for revealing government 
corruption as a People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] reporter. Mr Ruan 
was secretary to former Chinese Communist Party general 
secretary Hu Yaobang, whose death in May 1989 triggered the 
Tiananmen protests. 
  While pro-Beijing groups welcome the government's stand, 
Governor Chris Patten is set to come under fire from liberal 
legislators when he returns to Hong Kong this week. Several 
said they would raise the issue at the Legislative Council on 
Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Independent legislator Christine Loh said she was not 
surprised at the visa rejection as the territory had a history 
of turning away "subversives". Ms Loh argued the "one country, 
two systems" concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong may 
disappear as China tries to dictate to Hong Kong. 
  Independent legislator Emily Lau said she could not 
understand why the two exiled scholars were refused entry. 
"They're not raving subversives. It's quite ridiculous," Ms 
Lau said. 
  Last Thursday Acting Governor Anson Chan said Hong Kong 
should not be used as a base for subversive activities for the 
June 4 anniversary. Last week China revealed a softening stance 
towards Hong Kong by indicating its willingness to allow four 
foreigners to sit as judges on the territory's Court of Final 
Appeal.

  [Text] Sensitivity surrounding this week's anniversary of 
the events in Tiananmen Square forced the government to refuse 
entry to Chinese dissidents wanting to visit Hong Kong, Governor 
Chris Patten said. He defended the government's decision to ban 
two Chinese scholars--Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming--from attending 
June 4 commemorative activities in Hong Kong. 
  Mr Patten said people should not be allowed to use the 
territory to criticize what is happening elsewhere at "sensitive 
moments." His comments implied that the government would 
consider a further ban on Chinese dissidents during other 
politically sensitive periods. "I think there is a difference 
between the freedoms that we all exercise here and at sensitive 
moments," he said on his return from Britain. "There are just 
some moments--you know it as well--which are more sensitive than 
others." 
  The two outspoken Chinese dissidents, who are now in the 
United States, were reportedly denied visas by the British 
Consulate in New York upon the Hong Kong Government's 
instruction. 
  Mr Patten also rejected comments by Chinese officials who 
attacked the government for allowing exiled labour activist Han 
Dongfang to stay in the territory. "It's a problem they have 
created, not us," Mr Patten said. 
  Mr Han was refused entry into China when attempting to 
return 
home last year.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Stresses That Stability and </F>
Prosperity Have Become Targets Sought by Young People"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the 
Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: Mainland and 
Hong Kong young people are most concerned about social 
stability. The Beijing storm which took place five years ago 
has become history, and history has come to a conclusion on 
this; we should not get entangled in this issue. 
  Zhang Junsheng believes that social stability and economic 
prosperity are the common wish of Hong Kong compatriots. In 
answer to a reporter's question while attending the anniversary 
of Zhongshan University's [in Guangzhou] law students alumnus in 
Hong Kong yesterday, Zhang Junsheng indicated that from a survey 
published in a Hong Kong newspaper conducted among Beijing, 
Guangzhou, and Hong Kong youths, he learned that Beijing, 
Guangzhou, and Hong Kong youths are most concerned about social 
stability and then a society with a legal system. Zhang 
Junsheng added that what Hong Kong people need now is a stable 
society, and he believes that Hong Kong citizens favor social 
stability and economic prosperity most. Stability and 
prosperity are the wish of the Hong Kong people. 
  When a reporter asked whether the Hong Kong Government's 
refusal of Liu Binyan's entry into the territory was the result 
of pressure from the Chinese side, Zheng Junsheng replied that 
the reporter should ask the Hong Kong Government.

  [Text] A march to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre ended with minor scuffles yesterday 
after police blocked access to the Xinhua (New China News 
Agency) headquarters. 
  The confrontation came after a three-hour march in which 
protesters demanded redress for the suffering of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement, labelled a "counter-revolutionary riot" 
by mainland authorities. 
  More than 3,000 people -- about half last year's number -- 
gathered outside Chater Garden and walked along Queensway and 
Hennessy Road to Causeway Bay, then to the Xinhua offices in 
Happy Valley. 
  A core member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the 
Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Cheung Man-kwong, said 
he believed people still had a strong passion for the movement. 
  Accompanied by alliance leader Szeto Wah and other key 
members including Mak Hoi-wah and Yeung Sum, Mr Cheung led the 
group in calling for the release of political dissidents in 
China and singing patriotic songs. 
  When the group reached the Queen Elizabeth Stadium opposite 
the Xinhua office, the police allowed 20 representatives to 
cross Queen's Road East to hand in a petition. 
  Barricades kept people back about 1.5 metres from the main 
entrance. 
  Alliance representatives were allowed to send only one 
person 
beyond the barricades to place the petition at the main gate. 
  They were not allowed to place a wreath and black banner on 
the doorstep. 
  Alliance leaders decided to stage a sit-in until the police 
yielded. 
  However, scuffles broke out when another demonstrator, Wong 
Kin, rushed the police line in the middle of Queen's Road East, 
attempting to join the alliance members. 
  He and a second protester were restrained and some 
photographers were pulled away by policemen. 
  The incident sparked allegations that human rights had been 
violated and that the Government might be bowing to Chinese 
pressure to suppress the demonstration. 
  Mr Cheung, also a legislator, said it was ridiculous for the 
police to insist that only the articles specified in the 
petition licence could be placed at the Xinhua entrance. 
  He questioned the legal basis on which the police had barred 
them from placing the flowers and banner on the footpath. 
  But Wan Chai District Commander Harold Bludd said the police 
were right in imposing the restriction. 
  "They do not have a permit to do it. That's why. They have 
a permit to hand in a petition. That's all," he said. 
  "It was not agreed that they would bring a flower cart, it 
was not agreed that they would bring their banners. There was 
no agreement that they would put them in front of the NCNA (New 
China News Agency) main entrance," Mr Bludd said.

  [Text] Police abused their discretionary right to ban 
petitions composed of unspecified materials during Sunday's 
demonstration outside the Xinhua News Agency, representatives of 
the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic 
Movement in China said yesterday. 
  Police clashed with a small number of demonstrators outside 
the Xinhua building when they tried to prevent Alliance members 
from placing a wreath and a banner in front of the entrance. A 
police spokesman defended their decision as one of "safety" and 
"to minimise inconvenience to the public". 
  And Governor Chris Patten defended the police, saying they 
behaved with a "good degree of tact." "These are not easy 
matters for the police, but I think from all I've heard... they 
behaved sensibly. Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are 
guaranteed under the Joint Declaration and we'll certainly do 
everything we can before 1997 to ensure the foundations for 
those freedoms are as secured as possible." 
  Alliance spokesman and United Democrat legislator Cheung 
Man-kwong said bringing along items in addition to the letter 
which was specified in the condition for the permit was a usual 
practice. He said that last year the group set five flags in 
front of the Xinhua building without any harassment from police. 
Mr Cheung said he was told Xinhua had expressed unhappiness 
over having items placed in front of its entrance. "The police 
have used their discretion to bow to the authorities," he said. 
  Asked whether items used in petitions should be specified in 
conditions for permits Mr Cheung said it would be "absurd" to go 
into such detail. 
  A police spokesman said the primary concern was the safety 
of 
demonstrators the public. "Those attending processions and 
demonstrations must heed police advice and directions for their 
own safety and to minimise inconvenience to other members of the 
public," he said.

<F P=106> [By Fung Wai-Kong and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Six senior journalists in ATV's [Asia Television 
Limited] News and Public Affairs Department resigned yesterday 
after the station management rejected a documentary about the 
1989 Beijing massacre. At least two other reporters indicated 
they were also ready to resign from the team of about 50 
covering Chinese and English channels. 
  Those who submitted their resignations yesterday were newly- 
appointed Acting News Controller Poon Fu-yin, Assistant News 
Controller Selina Li Yuklin, Executive Editor Lo Wing-hung, 
Managing Editor Lui Wan-sang, Assignment Editor Choy Pui-ying 
and City Editor Lau Kok-wa. 
  The news division had planned to include a Spanish 
documentary in the News Magazine programme on the Home Channel 
on June 3 to mark the fifth anniversary of the massacre. The 
programme contains film which seemed to support the long-held 
Chinese position that there was no killing in Tiananmen Square 
when People's Liberation Army troops crushed the pro-democracy 
movement with tanks and rifles. The massacre has become known as 
the Tiananmen Square incident, even though it is widely accepted 
that most of the deaths occurred in the streets around the 
square. 
  The management last Saturday ordered that a short segment 
promoting the film be taken off the air. Executives reportedly 
told news staff that as five years had already passed since the 
massacre, it did nobody any good to look back at the issue and 
that one should be prospective rather than retrospective. 
  According to one ATV journalist the decision was "very sad 
and disappointing." "This is only 1994, still three years 
before the handover and yet media owners and senior managers 
have begun to do things like that. It's a very sad thing. The 
decision actually leaves no choice for the news management 
staff. It is extremely difficult for them to remain in their 
posts when the news department no longer enjoys editorial 
independence." 
  He emphasised that the resignation of the senior staff was 
not a bargaining tactic, but rather a strong disapproval of the 
decision. "We hope this action will alert the public to the 
growing gag on the news media and to discourage other media from 
taking the same path." 
  It is understood management will meet staff today. 
  ATV management denied any knowledge of the controversy. 
  Assistant Controller of ATV's Public Relations and Publicity 
Department Lu Fung said she had not heard of the resignations 
and so was unable to comment on the issue. She added that she 
was unable to contact the station's senior management. Deputy 
Chief Executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who has overall control 
of the news division, was unavailable for comment last night. 
  The ATV newsroom is still recovering from a major shakeup a 
fortnight ago. The Assistant Chief Executive Timothy Jim and 
News Controller Garman Chan left their posts on May 16, soon 
after Mr Chang was appointed. 
  Independent legislator and a vocal supporter of press 
freedom, Emily Lau Wai-hing, said she was astonished by the 
decision which she felt was an indication that ATV was imposing 
self-censorship on sensitive programmes. She warned that the 
credibility of the company would suffer as a result of this 
incident. Rejecting the explanation that the programme was 
undesirable because five years had gone by since the massacre, 
Ms Lau said: "This is unacceptable. On Sunday we had thousands 
of people out on the streets to commemorate the incident." 
  She said it was ridiculous for ATV to make such a decision 
only a day after the company's representative criticised rival 
TVB for blocking a documentary on the private life of Mao 
Zedong. She called for an explanation from ATV management and 
asked that the journalists who resigned reveal the background to 
the incident. 
  The Journalists' Association was last night trying to 
contact 
ATV staff and would not comment. 
  Prominent Hong Kong-based activist Lau Shan-ching said: "It 
is a clear evidence of commercial interest taking precedence 
over journalistic ideals." 
  Recently television companies had been stepping up efforts 
to 
expand their market into the mainland and they also benefit 
substantially from advertisement of China's property market, he 
said. It was only natural that they feared offending their 
financial sources in broadcasting the sensitive documentary. 
  Admitting that it was inevitable, he said the only effective 
way to prevent the event from happening was to enact laws to 
prevent interference from journalistic judgment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sad For Press Freedom"] </F>
  [Text] The resignation of senior news executives and 
journalists at ATV [Asia Television Limited] last night has 
brought the debate over self-censorship in the Hong Kong media 
into sharper focus. The phenomenon has often been discussed but 
rarely has there been such clear evidence of it happening. 
  The self-censorship at the territory's television stations 
has now got to the stage where material relating to sensitive 
subjects may be cut, even when it appears to reflect the 
official Beijing view. ATV's decision not to screen a film in 
commemoration of the June 4 massacre is illogical. There is 
even less logic in the decision made by ATV as it should know 
well that some material in the programme actually purported to 
show there were no killings on Tiananmen Square itself. 
  Self-censorship is not driven by logic. It is driven by 
fear. Its proponents are always having to second-guess the 
powers they are trying to impress. Braver organisations would 
be tempted to push the limits of Beijing's tolerance, attempting 
to see how far they can go without provoking an angry reaction. 
Paradoxically, silence from Beijing makes the self-censors more 
timid. When in doubt, runs their creed, cut it out. 
  Such timidity will be counterproductive in the end. The 
journalists who quit are not the only losers. The Hong Kong 
public are also deprived of a programme which after all may not 
be as offensive to Beijing leaders, who have occasionally shown 
flexibility, as ATV management thinks. The TV stations must 
recover their self-respect or they will drag others down with 
them. They should have the courage to broadcast sensitive, not 
malicious, material. Showing a documentary recording a 
historical event would not necessarily mean ATV is anti-Beijing. 
By choosing not to screen it, ATV has alienated and 
disappointed the public.

bloody wake of the crackdown on pro-democracy students in 
Tiananmen Square. One of the latest people to be helped by the 
secret organisation is a Shenzhen judge who fled after he 
complained openly about corruption and persecution by the 
judiciary in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ). 
  Mr Zhang, who did not want to give his full name, is the 
first senior judicial figure to cross the border in several 
years. Although he made his own way out of China and is not a 
pro-democracy supporter, Mr Zhang was helped when he first 
crossed the border by the Yellow Bird underground movement. 
Once in Hong Kong he made contact with the same Yellow Bird 
officials who, in 1989, helped Tiananmen Square organisers such 
as Wuerkaixi and Chai Ling flee abroad in the tense weeks after 
the June 4 crackdown. 
  Although the organisation had scaled down its operation, 
officials were still able to put Mr Zhang in a safe house. He 
is now on his way to another country. Yellow Bird is currently 
looking after six activists who are in Hong Kong awaiting asylum 
in a third country. 
  Using a system of mainland sympathisers, who operated at 
great personal risk, the movement managed to slip some of the 
most wanted student leaders out of the country. It has never 
revealed its methods in case further problems in China meant the 
"railroad" would be put into full use again. "After five years, 
I think all Chinese people in Hong Kong are still thinking about 
Tiananmen Square," one of the organisers said. "I think they 
are very concerned about what will happen, because in three 
years we are united." 
  He said the number of dissidents leaving China has dropped 
over the last year, and that many were being encouraged to stay. 
"After five years, many people still want to come out, but we 
advise them to stay . . . we need them inside to bring about a 
new kind of China." Since Yellow Bird was formed, it has helped 
500 dissidents flee from the mainland. And it supports people 
like Mr Zhang, who was wanted in every province for trying to 
expose high level corruption and for escaping from an education 
centre although he had never been convicted of a crime. 
  "I did not intend to link my personal ordeal with politics 
at 
first, but what I experienced during this period made me 
understand the fundamental problem is the system of the 
country," Mr Zhang said. During a seven-month stay in an 
"education centre" on the other side of the Lowu border fence, 
Mr Zhang documented unconvicted "prisoners" making rice noodles 
for export to the United States in filthy conditions. 
  His comments on the abuse of power in the legal system in 
Shenzhen has given the first real insight into an otherwise 
closed part of the society. "China has laws, but no one wants 
to carry them out," Mr Zhang said. "I went to Shenzhen because 
it is an open place with good prospects. My decision was not 
wrong. Shenzhen is a good place, and there are a lot of chances 
but it is the people inside it who are corrupt who disappoint 
me." 
  Mr Zhang's problems began in 1990 when he tried to divorce 
his wife who did not want the separation. He now believes she 
had formed some sort of relationship with a senior court 
official. Soon afterwards, he said, the official "lost face" 
when Mr Zhang saw him and his wife in the official's car outside 
the Shenzhen Middle People's Court. 
  Three days later the official, who Mr Zhang said was a 
powerful man, had him "unlawfully detained" for three days in a 
room at the court building. "Twenty-five days later they held 
me again for three days. They had no right to arrest me and 
were abusing their power," he said. 
  But his real problems began in 1992, after a court clerk 
allegedly found that the senior court official had accepted a 
bribe -- said to have been paid in US dollars--during a 
multi-million fraud trial involving a Shenzhen company. Mr 
Zhang, who was first employed as a judge by Shenzhen city in 
1988 handling mid-level commercial cases, said the manager of 
the company later left China for Singapore. "I then wrote to a 
lot of the upper level judges and to the central authorities, 
including Li Peng, complaining about the case but I never 
received any response," he said. In all, Mr Zhang wrote about 
300 letters over the next two years to senior government 
officials asking for help and seeking an investigation into his 
detention. 
  But in April last year he was grabbed by Public Security 
Bureau (PSB) officers at his house and taken to the Shenzhen 
Labour Education Centre on Shang Bu Bei Road. As soon as he 
arrived he was punched and kicked by five members of staff, a 
beating he believed seriously damaged some internal organs. All 
of his attempts to have an appeal heard went unanswered. 
"Finally a judge from the Guangdong High Court came to see me 
and promised to help," Mr Zhang said. "But then he said I was 
making a lot of trouble between government departments and that 
I had a light sentence at the moment, but if I continued I would 
get a longer one. 
  "On September 1 last year, because I kept writing letters, 
the chief judge and three sub-chief judges came to see me to 
sort out the problem peacefully." They told Mr Zhang if he did 
not agree to sign a "contract" binding him to stop pursuing the 
matter, he would be held in solitary confinement normally 
reserved for violent criminals. 
  When he again refused to comply, he said guards at the 
centre 
started going through his possessions and he found himself given 
harder tasks and told to work longer hours. During his seven 
months at the centre he saw inmates blinded and made deaf by 
beatings. He also witnessed young inmates making rice noodles 
for export to the US in rooms where hygiene conditions were 
"dreadful". 
  Then, last November, he had an accident while working on the 
printing press when one eye was flooded with ink. "The 
authorities allowed me to go out for treatment and when I got to 
the Shenzhen People's Armed Police Hospital, I fled. 
  "The same night I bought a plane ticket to Beijing and went 
to the US Embassy, but I couldn't get in because of the army 
guards outside." 
  He said he kept trying to hand over his evidence but was 
followed, and every time he made a telephone call the line was 
tapped. Earlier this year he slipped into Hong Kong using a 
false name while part of a seven-day tour of the territory.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong made its decision to demolish Rennie's 
Mill [Village] under pressure from Beijing a senior Taiwan 
official in charge of overseas Chinese affairs alleges. 
  Chang Hsiao-yen, chairman of Taiwan's cabinet-level Overseas 
Chinese Affairs Commission, told a delegation of Hong Kong 
journalists last week that Beijing was behind the government's 
decision to reclaim the village where many Kuomintang soldiers 
have lived since the communists took over the mainland in 1949. 
  He said Taiwan was dissatisfied with compensation made by 
the 
British Hong Kong Government for those forced out of their 
homes. "I believe Beijing has given very heavy pressure to the 
Hong Kong Government," said Mr Chang, a son of former Taiwan 
strongman and president Chiang Ching-kuo and grandson of 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. 
  He said Beijing would not tolerate a sea of Taiwan's 
national 
flags flying on the territory after 1997. However, he said 
Taiwan would not retreat from Hong Kong after 1997 despite its 
reversion to mainland rule. Mr Chiang vowed to continue 
Taiwan's presence. "To think that the government is retreating 
from Hong Kong is absolutely wrong," he said. "Instead, we are 
considering expanding and strengthening our presence and our 
services to our compatriots there but we should make some 
changes in our approach to business." 
  Mr Chiang said the Taiwan Government would not make any 
changes to its policy towards Hong Kong after 1997 and would 
continue its economic, trade, cultural, and educational 
exchanges with the territory. "We will not make changes to any 
of our policies concerning relations with Hong Kong and we will 
spare no effort to continue to assist the territory to maintain 
the present conditions after Beijing's takeover," he said. 
  Mr Chiang said freedom and democracy were two of the most 
important and basic elements that the territory should be 
allowed to preserve, adding that that was the ruling 
Kuomintang's basic policy towards Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong 
affairs would be under the jurisdiction of another cabinet-level 
ministry instead of under Mr Chiang's commission after 1997.

  [Text] Hong kong, May 27 (AFP)--A leading human rights 
monitor rounded on President Bill Clinton on Friday [27 May] for 
renewing China's preferential trade status, lashing it as "one 
more capitulation" that would imperil dozens of activists for 
democracy. The organisation, Human Rights Watch/Asia, scorned 
Clinton's assessment that China had complied with several 
conditions on human rights that he linked to renewal of 
most-favoured-nation status, which gives Chinese goods lucrative 
customs access to the US market. 
  "Far from improving, the overall human rights situation has 
significantly worsened in the year since (Clinton's) executive 
order (on MFN conditions) was issued," the group said in a 
statement issued here. The decision was "one more capitulation 
on human rights," the statement said. 
  "President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on 
China to improve its human rights practices," said Sidney Jones, 
Human Rights Watch/Asia's executive director. "Clinton has left 
his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical, while 
the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed, 
uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by 
this decision." 
  Human Rights Watch/Asia -- formerly known as Asia Watch -- 
enjoys a strong reputation as an independent monitor of human 
rights in China. Earlier this month, it released a report 
documenting what it said were the cases of several hundred 
protesters, seized in the crackdown of the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement, who remain behind bars. 
  The statement issued Friday said the leading dissidents, 
workers and religious activists would now be more vulnerable to 
persecution and arrest, given that Chinese leaders "understand 
that a crackdown would not bring about a disruption of trade." 
"Dozens of dissidents had their trials or sentences postponed 
while the Chinese government awaited Washington's decision," it 
said. "Now they can happen with little fear of persecution."

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong economists 
welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's 
most favored nation (MFN) trade status for another year. 
  Xu Yongfu, a senior research fellow in the Hong Kong-Macao 
regional office of the Bank of China, said the decision to renew 
China's MFN trade status and delink human rights from trade 
issues was a pragmatic and wise option. 
  He said that the decision dispelled fears over the Sino-U.S. 
trade development and laid a foundation for the trade growth 
between China and the United States and in the world trade as a 
whole. 
  Edward Leung, chief economist of Hong Kong Trade Development 
Council, said Clinton's announcement to delink human rights from 
trade issues provided a basis for the smooth trade development 
between the two countries and is conducive to China's reentry 
into the GATT. 
  As a large number of Hong Kong manufacturers have opened 
plants in southern China and shipped their products to the 
United States, renewal of China's MFN trade status will make 
owners of these plants at ease and help increase the volume of 
re-export. 
  Benny Chiu, research manager of the China Service Ltd. of 
the 
Hong Hong Bank, said that Clinton's decision will benefit both 
the United States, a major supplier of funds to China, and 
China, a big market for U.S. investors.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation [MFN] 
trading status for another year and to delink human rights from 
trade issues has been warmly received by HK [Hong Kong] 
residents, especially businessmen here. 
  Local business leaders today hailed the decision as not only 
conducive to the trade development among China, the United 
States and Hong Kong, but also conducive to China's reentry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Raymond Ch'ien Kuo-fung, chairman of the Federation of Hong 
Kong Industries, said that the decision will have positive 
impact on the economic development in the three areas, 
especially in Hong Kong. 
  Before the decision was made, some investors had taken a 
wait- and-see attitude towards investment in China, now that 
most of the uncertainties have been cleared away, investors' 
confidence in China will surely be enhanced, which, in turn, 
will benefit Hong Kong, Ch'ien said. 
  Ian A. Christie, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber 
of 
Commerce, believed that the renewal of China's MFN trading 
status has increased the chance for China to reenter the GATT. 
  He hoped China could get its permanent MFN trading status 
from the United States next year, which he said would benefit 
all of the three sides. 
  Henry Tang Ying-yen, vice-president of the Federation of 
Hong 
Kong Industries, expressed his welcome to President Clinton's 
announcement to delink human rights from trade issues while 
deciding to renew China's MFN trading status. 
  He said that the bilateral trade between two countries 
should 
be conducted on an equal basis, and it is never correct for one 
country to threaten the other with unfair trade conditions. 
  Meanwhile, many local public figures have also expressed 
their concerns over the U.S. decision to ban the import of 
Chinese weapons.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The American Chamber 
of Commerce in Hong Kong welcomes President Bill Clinton's 
decision to renew China's most-favored nation (MFN) trade status 
and delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN. 
  "it is critically important to Asia -- the most dynamic and 
vital region on the face of the globe -- that our two countries 
have a relationship that works," the chamber said in a news 
release issued here this evening. 
  It noted that the president's statement of his intention to 
delink human rights issues from the annual renewal of MFN 
signals a firm commitment on the part of the American Government 
to rebuild a "functional, effective and wide-ranging bilateral 
relationship." 
  "The long and bitter debate over MFN is over at last," said 
Gerald Murdock, chairman of the chamber. 
  This is a time for "moderation and optimism," he said, 
adding 
"both the United States and China must seize the moment to build 
new ties, based on broader engagement and dialog."

  [Text] Beijing, 18 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--This 
afternoon, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, met a 
visiting delegation from the five associations of the plastics 
industry of Hong Kong headed by Leung Kei-yau at Ziguangge in 
Zhongnanhai. 
  Zou Jiahua first asked about the current condition of the 
plastics industry, one of the pillars of Hong Kong's 
manufacturing industry and its investment in mainland China. 
  He told the guests that the petrochemical industry had 
become 
an indispensable part of China's economic development, and the 
mainland was also going all out to develop petrochemical and 
related industries in order to meet increasing market demand. 
He also mentioned many times that Hong Kong's plastics industry 
will play a big role in promoting economic cooperation between 
Hong Kong and the mainland and promoting that industry's 
production in the mainland. 
  As requested by the guests, Zou Jiahua gave a detailed 
explanation of the Chinese Government's position and viewpoint 
on the development of Sino-U.S. relations and the 
most-favored-nation status issue. He held an optimistic 
attitude toward the prospect of solving relevant problems and 
expressed confidence in overcoming possible obstacles and 
difficulties. 
  He also answered questions about strengthening macroeconomic 
control and curbing high inflation. 
  Jing Shuping, chairman of the National Federation of 
Industrialists and Businessmen, and Chen Ziying, deputy director 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended the meeting. 
  In addition, tonight, Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and director of the CPC Central 
Committee's United Front Work Department, and Wan Shaofen, 
deputy director of the United Front Work Department, also met 
with the delegation headed by Leung Kei-yau.

  [Text] Lu Ping, the director of Beijing's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, last night signalled China's willingness 
to make progress on the much-delayed talks over the building of 
the territory's ninth container terminal and the new airport. 
Lu's remarks indicate a significant gesture by China to improve 
the atmosphere surrounding talks on economic matters. However, 
Lu's seeming desire for progress in talks has in the past been 
followed by serious backtracking. 
  Lu told a Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce delegation in 
Beijing 
that the issue of Container Terminal 9 (CT9) should be 
approached "from the commercial perspective" rather than "mixing 
it up with political factors." Lu said, however, that China 
could not proceed to discussions with the British side before 
the Hong Kong Government had finalised arrangements with 
developers. He said that "economic rules", rather than 
"political trading" should be the guideline for building CT9. 
  Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, last night welcomed Lu's 
remarks. "We accept Lu's comment with delight but the 
government has never mixed the CT9 issue with any political 
factors. The government is now discussing development rights 
with consortia," she said, adding Hong Kong hoped to settle the 
matter as soon as possible as container terminals were very busy. 
  Lu also said Beijing "genuinely wished" to maintain its 
cooperation with Britain in other areas, citing the progress 
made during the latest talks on the financial arrangements for 
the new airport project. Both sides had agreed to discuss the 
Airport Corporation Bill and hoped to reach a general agreement 
on financial arrangements. 
  John Meredith, managing director of Hong Kong International 
Terminals (HIT), has said that construction costs have increased 
by about 20 percent as a result of the lengthy delay. 
  Interested developers include a consortium formed by Modern 
Terminals Ltd (MTL), HIT, the state-owned China Ocean Shipping 
Corporation, and the Jardine Pacific-led Tsing Yi Container 
Terminal group. 
  Turning to other matters, Lu called for an increase in the 
number of meetings of experts from both sides under the Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). He urged the speeding up of work on 
localizing Hong Kong's laws, only some of which could be left 
until after 1997. He invited Hong Kong's "business friends" to 
suggest which laws had to be adapted and approved (by the JLG) 
as soon as possible. 
  On the issue of permanent right of abode for returning Hong 
Kong emigrants, Lu said China welcomed Hong Kong returnees. He 
promised that China would formulate a "lenient policy" and "more 
simple approaches" to enable them to continue to live and work 
in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The value of Hong 
Kong's total exports grew by 8.1 percent in the first four 
months of this year over the same period of last year, the 
Census and Statistics Department announced today. 
  Among the total, the value of re-exports rose by 13 percent, 
while that of domestic exports fell by 7.8 percent, according to 
external trade figures released by the department. 
  Supported largely by the continued expansion in Hong Kong's 
re- export trade, the value of imports showed an increase of 9.5 
percent. 
  These led to a visible trade deficit of 24.4 billion H.K. 
dollars (3.13 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months, 
equivalent to 6.8 percent of the value of imports during the 
period. 
  This compared with a deficit of 18.4 billion H.K. dollars 
(2.34 billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 5.6 percent of the 
value of imports, recorded in the same period of last year. 
  Commenting on the trade figures, a government spokesman said 
that the performance of re-exports was still quite robust, 
although the growth rate had moderated somewhat from last year. 
  The spokesman attributed the moderation mainly to slower 
growth in re-exports to the Chinese mainland, the United States 
and Germany.

  [Text] Macao, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The continuity of China's 
most favoured nation (MFN) trading status was not only 
beneficial to China's economic and trade development, but also 
good for Macao's economy. 
  Maria Gabriela dos Remedios Cesar, director of the Macao 
Government's economic department, was quoted by local newspapers 
as saying that the continuity of China's MFN status was a good 
news for businessmen and also was favourable for steady 
development of Sino- U.S. trade relations. 
  In another development, chairman of the Macao Export and 
Import Association Victor Ng said it was a sensible act of the 
U.S. Government to continue China's MFN status, for it is good 
for economic development of both sides. 
  He also said that it was a good thing that the U.S. 
Government has ever done to separate human rights from MFN 
issue. However, he added, it is hard to understand that the 
U.S. Government use munitions as a condition for continuity of 
China's MFN status.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 KYODO -- The Chinese Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday [1 June] denounced an incident two days 
ago in which a gunman threatened former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa in a Tokyo hotel by firing a shot at the ceiling. 
  "It is an act which does not win the hearts of the people to 
terrorize a politician who took a wise attitude on the issue of 
Japan's past invasion," according to a comment released by the 
ministry's information department. 
  The assailant told police that he was angered by Hosokawa's 
apology, when he was premier, for Japan's wartime actions.

<F P=106> [By Wang Pingxing (3769 1627 5281)] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, 30 May (XINHUA) -- A presidential 
statement adopted by the UN Security Council [UNSC] this evening 
calls for immediate consultation between the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the DPRK on technical measures 
for replacing the nuclear fuel rods of the latter's nuclear 
reactor. 
  The statement urges the DPRK to replace the fuel rods of its 
5-megawatt reactor "in a manner that preserves the technical 
possibility of fuel measurements" as required by the IAEA. 
  The statement also urges IAEA inspectors to stay in the DPRK 
to monitor the 5 megawatt-reactor. 
  Speaking during the UNSC consultations, Li Zhaoxing, China's 
permanent representative to the United Nations, pointed out: 
Because of their joint efforts, all parties concerned have 
achieved a series of successes in handling the DPRK nuclear 
issue. These hard-earned successes should be cherished. 
Certain problems have now appeared with regard to the refueling 
of the 5 megawatt-reactor, we hope the IAEA and the Koreans will 
continue their consultations on the technical measures for 
monitoring the refueling and make efforts to reach agreements as 
early as possible. 
  Li Zhaoxing reiterated China's stand on this issue, saying 
that the fundamental way to settle the DPRK nuclear issue is by 
dialogue and negotiations through channels that have been 
established. He said: China does not endorse any action that 
may exacerbate contradictions. As a signatory of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, China, as always, does not support or 
encourage nuclear proliferation. He said: "We have been 
looking forward to a proper solution to the DPRK nuclear issue 
through proper channels so that peace and stability can be 
maintained in the Korean peninsula and so that there will be a 
nuclear-free Korean peninsula. We are ready to make continual 
efforts to attain this goal."

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (CNS) -- With the approval of the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs, a non-government commercial body, 
namely the China-Southeast Asia Commercial Committee, will be 
set up in China in a bid to develop economic and trade relations 
between the country and Southeast Asian countries. Following 
preparations for over one year, the committee is about to be 
formally established in Haikou on June 5. 
  Being neighbours of China, some countries like Singapore and 
Thailand in Southeast Asia have set up commercial groups to 
specialize in economic cooperation and trade with China which, 
however, has no corresponding non-government bodies to deal with 
commercial relations with these countries. Adverse impacts on 
economic cooperation and trade between China and the Southeast 
Asian countries have been seen to a certain extent. 
  The Executive Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the 
China Pacific Economic Cooperation, Mr. Chen Luzhi, will be the 
director of the new group while the Chairman of Board of 
Directors of the China Import and Export Bank, Mr. Tong 
Zhiquang, and the Vice Governor of Hainan Province, Mr. Mao 
Zhijun, will be honorary directors. 
  As Hainan is the province in China to see the shortest 
distance from the country to the Southeast Asia region and is 
the largest special economic zone, it can act as a bridge 
between China and Southeast Asian countries in order to promote 
economic cooperation and trade between them. 
  A seminar on re-export trade with Southeast Asia and on 
border trade will be held following an inaugural meeting of the 
commercial body.

  [Text] Manila, May 30 (XINHUA) -- One health official and 
four organizations including two from China were chosen to be 
bestowed with the World Health Organization's (WHO) 1994 Tobacco 
or Health Award for their continuing effort and support in 
fighting tobacco. 
  The awardees were announced here today by the WHO regional 
office for the western Pacific. 
  The award, which highlights the observance of the World No- 
Tobacco Day on May 31 each year, is presented annually to a very 
selected number of individuals and institutions for their 
continuing commitment to promoting a tobacco-free society 
through research or health promotion activities. 
  It is intended to make governments, communities, groups and 
individuals aware of the health hazards of smoking and encourage 
them to take appropriate action, the who said. 
  The five awardees for this year in the western Pacific 
region 
are Philippine Health Secretary Juan Flavier; Buchun [spelling 
of name as received], YMCA, South Korea; Cathay Pacific 
Airlines, Hong Kong; and the Chinese Association on Smoking and 
Health as well as the Health Bureau of Jishan County, Shanxi 
Province of China. 
  At present, three million people die of tobacco-related 
diseases worldwide every year, WHO said, warning that if the 
current trend continues the death toll from smoking would reach 
10 million by 2025 and 70 percent of them would be in the 
developing world. 
  In view of the agressive promotion on the part of the 
tobacco 
companies, which have predicted a 33 percent increase in tobacco 
sales in the western Pacific region before the end of the 
century, the who has launched a program aimed to ban tobacco 
advertisements completely in the western Pacific region by the 
year 2000. 
  This year's World No-Tobacco Day links the media to fighting 
smoking with the theme of "The Media and Tobacco: Getting the 
Health Message Across." 
  In bestowing the award to Flavier today, WHO's regional 
director for western Pacific Dr. S.T. Han challenged the media 
to help bring about a significant change in tobacco consumption 
"by instigating a truly dynamic health information campaign on 
the danger of smoking." 
  He also urged the media to support anti-tobacco legislation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Gertrude Mongella, 
visiting secretary-general of the Fourth World Conference on 
Women, said here today that she was very pleased to see that 
"China is really determined to make the conference a success." 
  She made these remarks in an interview here this afternoon 
with a group of Chinese journalists while talking about her 
impressions from her study tour of China. 
  Mongella said that as with the three previous world women's 
meetings, "the main focus of the fourth conference has been on 
the advancement of women in the areas of equality, development, 
and peace." 
  She noted that the Third World Women's Conference in 1985 
adopted the Nairobi forward-looking strategies for the 
advancement of women to the year 2000, covering almost all 
problems in society. 
  The fourth conference, to be held here next year in Beijing, 
will focus on limited critical issues such as the the impact of 
growing poverty on women, equal chances for women's education, 
women and problems related to their health, violence against 
women, the effects of armed conflict and other conflicts on 
women, and equal women's participation in the definition of 
economic structures, policies and productive forces. 
  She told the journalists that in making preparations for the 
conference, each member state "should write a report" on its 
achievements and obstacles in implementing the nairobi 
strategies and suggesting actions as well. 
  She said she also expects the member states to conduct a 
wide 
discussion of these concerned areas among men and women and in 
government and non-government circles. 
  Mongella announced five regional conferences to be held in 
the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, West Asia, Europe and 
Africa in preparation for the fourth conference. 
  She expressed the hope that Chinese journalists will do more 
promotion of the conference to work for its smooth staging and 
to inform the 1.2 billion Chinese people about it. 
  It is imperative for Chinese journalists to popularize 
Chinese women's achievements so that more people in the world 
will understand China and Chinese women, she said. 
  This is also one of the major aims of the fourth world 
conference, she added. 
  Mongella said she was "very impressed" by the women, 
particularly the strength of women in China, adding that she 
believed that very few people in the world know the truth about 
women in China. 
  But, she said, when they come to recognize how much the 
women 
of China have achieved, especially in their work and managing 
capabilities and rights for equal work, they will feel surprised. 
  During the interview Mongella also answered a series of 
questions, including her comments on working women in China.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the 
Shanghai ships' sewage treatment plant, financed largely by a 
grant from a United Nations fund for global environmental 
protection and loans from the World Bank, has just started. 
  Local officials said Friday [27 May] that the project will 
cost 120 million yuan (about 13.79 million U.S. dollars), of 
which 4.31 million U.S. dollars will be covered by donated money 
from the U.N. fund and another 6.23 million U.S. dollars will be 
covered by World Bank loans. 
  The plant will be built and managed by the Shanghai Maritime 
Transport (Group) Co. The plant at Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, will 
have a 300m waterfront, with a dock to handle ships with 35,000 
dead weight tonnages. It will be equipped with modern greasy 
dirt and sewage treatment facilities. 
  The whole project is expected to be finished in 1995. By 
then, the plant will help treat 400,000 tons of greasy dirt and 
sewage and 100,000 tons of water polluted by chemicals a year. 
  Construction of similar environmental protection projects 
has 
also started in five other port cities: Dalian, Tianjin, 
Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou. 
  The building of the projects in these six ports will involve 
use of a total of 30 million U.S. dollars of donated money from 
the U.N. fund and 15 million U.S. dollars of loans from the 
World Bank.

  [Text] United Nations, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The international 
community should take a positive approach in handling the 
relationship between trade and the environment, a Chinese 
delegate told the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development. 
  Zhang Kunmin, head of the Chinese delegation, made these 
remarks while addressing high-level members of the commission on 
Thursday [26 May]. 
  He said that trade policy measures for environmental 
purposes 
should not be turned into means towards unjust discrimination or 
limitations on international trade. 
  He added that any environmental measures aimed at solving 
cross- boundary and global environmental issues should be based 
on international consensus. 
  The commission, a watchdog body set up to monitor progress 
after the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development--known 
as the Earth Summit--held its second session on May 16-27. 
  The Chinese delegate called attention to the following 
points 
in taking a positive approach toward the question of trade and 
the environment. 
  First, development and trade and environmental protection 
should be made to promote and compliment each other instead of 
being antagonistic. 
  In handling the relationship between trade and the 
environment, a long-range, positive approach should be followed, 
and efforts should be made in both fields. Any unbalanced 
approach which would hurt one or the other should be avoided. 
  Second, the focal point should be on measures benefiting the 
greatest number of people, he said. 
  Since only a limited number of countries possess advanced 
and 
environmentally sound technologies and products and the 
financial ability to popularize them, efforts should be made to 
ensure that mankind can benefit from them through open, 
nondiscriminatory and equitable international trade, and through 
technology transfer and cooperation. 
  He urged particular efforts against trends based on narrow 
business interest considerations, and those unjustly harmful to 
the trade opportunities of developing countries. 
  Finally, he said, emphasis should be placed on assistance 
and 
support. 
  To combine trade with sustainable development, corresponding 
means and abilities are needed, particularly financial and 
technological resources. 
  He urged the international community to help developing 
states build and improve their abilities through real action, 
including financial support, technology transfer and the opening 
of markets. 
  The Chinese delegate called on the international community 
to 
carry out the commitments made at the Earth Summit as soon as 
possible and as effectively as possible. 
  Zhang said he expects the commission's deliberations on 
trade 
and the environment to have a positive impact on the relevant 
discussions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and 
the U.N. Conference On trade and Development.

  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank recently 
approved a 350 million U.S. dollars loan for China in the 
construction of the Yangzhou Thermal Power Plant while providing 
a guarantee for the bank's extended Co-Financing Operations 
Program (ECO), also for the plant project. 
  The ECO program agreement worth 120 million U.S. dollars was 
signed here today between China's Ministry of Finance and more 
than a dozen banks from six countries involved in the program. 
  This is the first financing for China under the World Bank's 
ECO. The project is one of China's largest energy projects to 
date, and the financing also represents the first syndicated 
loan financing undertaken by the Ministry of Finance on the 
international market. 
  Present at the signing ceremony were Chinese Premier Li 
Peng, 
Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli, Minister of Electricity Shi 
Dazhen and senior Jiangsu provincial officials. 
  The Yangzhou Thermal Power Plant Project, about 100 km from 
Nanjing, the Jiangsu provincial capital, includes the 
construction of two 600-megawatt coal-fired generating units and 
ancillary facilities as well as two 30-km high-voltage 
transmitting lines. 
  The whole project involves a total investment of 1.3 billion 
U.S. dollars, of which 470 million U.S. dollars are coming from 
the World Bank and the ECO program. The remainder will come 
from domestic sources. 
  The ECO financing consists of two parts: a 90 million U.S. 
syndicated loan facility involving 12 banks from six countries 
and a 30 million U.S. dollar-equivalent yen facility provided by 
four Japanese life insurance companies. Both facilities carry a 
15-year final maturity and a 5-year grace period, with all 
principal repayment after 10 years fully guaranteed by the World 
Bank. 
  An official from the finance ministry said the first 
syndicated ECO program extended the loan to 15 years from the 
earlier period of ten years. This, he noted, has opened a new 
channel for China to use more overseas capital, including 
financing from the World Bank.

<F P=106> [Report by China Radio International correspondent Lin </F>
Shaowen; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] President Clinton announced the decision [on 
renewal of China's most favored nation (MFN) status] on Thursday 
[26 May]. He told the White House press conference that his 
country should see relations with China within the broader 
context of policy in the Pacific-Asian [as heard] region. He 
said China has one of the fastest-growing economies in the 
world, and U.S. exports to China last year were valued at more 
than $8 billion, creating job opportunities for 150,000 
Americans. But Clinton also said the U.S. would maintain the 
existing sanctions imposed on China since 1989. 
  China has welcomed the decision on the renewal of the MFN. 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday, 
saying that the decision would create favorable conditions for 
the further strengthening and expansion of trade and economic 
cooperation between the two sides, and the improvement and 
development of relations overall. It said the decision serves 
the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples. The 
Foreign Ministry said MFN, which is granted by both the U.S. and 
China, is beneficial to both sides. 
  The Foreign Ministry said China has consistently opposed 
linking MFN with issues not concerned with trade, or attaching 
conditions and requirements. The statement expressed regret for 
the maintenance of U.S. sanctions against China, stressing that 
the U.S. side has made unjustifiable accusations about China's 
human rights situation. It said this decision constitutes an 
interference in China's internal affairs, which is absolutely 
unacceptable to China. It hoped that the U.S. Government would 
lift all sanctions against China at the earliest possible date, 
and abandon all measures detrimental to the development of 
bilateral relations. 
  The Foreign Ministry statement said China and the United 
States share a broad range of interests. The current situation 
offers a historic opportunity for the enhancement of 
Sino-American relations. The Chinese Government attaches 
importance to such relations, and has made and will continue to 
make major efforts for their improvement and development. The 
statement believes that Sino-American relations will enjoy 
smooth and healthy progress so long as both sides strictly abide 
by the guidelines and principles outlined in the three 
Sino-American joint communiques, develop mutual trust, reduce 
trouble, develop cooperation, and refrain from confrontation.

<F P=106> ["Weekly commentary" by Kung Yao-wen (7895 5069 2429): "The </F>
Favorable New Conditions Created for Sino-U.S. Economic and 
Trade Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Clinton "Changes His Stand" 
  The most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, which had 
complicated Sino-U.S. ties for a long time, reached a decisive 
period this week and became the focus of the Asia-Pacific region 
and the world at large. As a matter of fact, many people had 
already predicted before U.S. President Clinton's formal 
announcement that he would inevitably reverse what he said last 
year. Clinton had to "change his stand" because he did not have 
many options. In the face of political, economic, and even 
strategic realities, the United States simply cannot revoke 
China's MFN trading status at this moment and wage a trade war 
with China. But the U.S. political leadership refuses to 
acknowledge the improvements that China's socialist 
modernization program has brought to the people's livelihood and 
democratic rights. As a result, Clinton extended China's MFN 
for another year, even though he said that the situation of 
China's human rights had not met the requirement of "overall 
progress" that he set last year. Meanwhile, Clinton also stated 
that human rights will be delinked from MFN in future annual 
assessments. 
  Clinton's policy readjustment has been welcomed by the 
Chinese and American people. The industrial and commercial 
circles in Hong Kong and the surrounding areas can have a 
breathing spell. If Sino-U.S. mutual benefit and cooperation 
are harmed by problems other than trade, it will have a 
far-reaching influence. When the interference of the 
controversy over human rights is removed from Sino-U.S. economic 
and trade relations in the future, it will be conducive to the 
steady development and cooperation between the two countries as 
well as to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. 
  In consideration of its own national interests, the U.S. 
Administration eventually gave up the mistaken policy of linking 
MFN with human rights. Figures from various quarters, including 
those from Hong Kong, convincingly lobbied the U.S. 
Administration, which helped effect the change in its stand. 
Fundamentally speaking, the "linkage policy" was doomed to 
failure. The United States had to squarely face China's 
economic strength and potential development. 
<H5>  The Removal of Additional Conditions </H5>
  When reviewing this change in the future, historians may 
judge this to mark the end of an era. "MFN" was actually a 
historic term first raised by the Americans in dealing with 
China. It was Britain that first used cannons and vessels to 
break through China's gates in the 19th century, which was 
followed by the U.S. request for "MFN." In other words, the 
United States wanted to share the privileges enjoyed by the big 
powers through the unequal treaties. Naturally, this was a 
one-sided approach. China, which was subject to aggression and 
humiliation, could not enjoy any privileges in the United 
States. All the unequal treaties were abolished only after the 
success of the Chinese revolution. 
  Today, MFN trading status is reciprocal and does not 
represent a special favor. It is granted by the two sides to 
enable them to normally conduct trade and avoid discriminatory 
tariffs. After the foundation of the PRC, the United States 
implemented the policy of encircling and embargoing China. 
Thanks to the later normalization of ties between the two 
countries, the United States granted MFN trading status to 
China, but with the condition of human rights attached, which 
continued to constitute pressure. It was China that persisted 
in economic construction, upheld the policy of reform and 
opening up, continuously enhanced its strength, and withstood 
U.S. pressure. From breaking through the blockade and 
encirclement in the past to the periodic victory won today, the 
United States had to admit that bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation can only be carried out on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit. Just imagine, if China had not maintained 
stability or had no ability to fight back economically, the 
United States could continue to regard trade as a favor with 
which it could menace and threaten China. 
<H5>  Reduce Troubles and Promote Cooperation </H5>
  Over the years, the MFN issue had to be argued about every 
year in the United States, which drove Sino-U.S. trade ties to 
the edge and also upset the Hong Kong business circles. 
Although these misgivings have been dispelled, there are still 
problems in Sino-U.S. ties. Objectively speaking, the United 
States will not let Sino-U.S. ties deteriorate. Viewed from the 
current conditions, it is unlikely that the United States will 
rapidly improve its ties with China. 
  First, the United States has continued to unreasonably 
criticize China's human rights record. It is quite natural for 
China and the United States, with different traditions of 
historical, cultural, and social development, to have different 
views on human rights, which can be exchanged on the basis of 
equality and mutual respect and can be improved with concerted 
efforts. China's human rights situation has continuously 
improved along with the country's economic development and 
political reform. There is also room for the United States to 
improve its human rights. However, the United States has 
stubbornly insisted on imposing its values on China and meddling 
in China's internal affairs under such an excuse. This is 
absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese, who have national pride. 
  Second, in bilateral economic and trade ties, the United 
States is used to blaming the other side rather than improving 
itself. Now that the MFN issue has been settled, there are some 
people in the United States who want to target China with the 
"Super 301" provisions. All these problems must be 
appropriately resolved. 
  Moreover, the principles laid down in the three joint 
communiques between the two countries need to be strictly 
observed. There are some people in the United States who always 
try to make an issue of the Taiwan and Tibet problems to 
infringe upon China's sovereignty. 
  The Chinese side is sincere in developing its cooperation 
with the United States. Both China and the United States are 
two major powers in the Asia-Pacific region which are 
economically complementary. Cooperation will benefit each side. 
Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed the following remarks 
on Sino-U.S. ties: Increase trust, reduce disagreements, develop 
cooperation, and keep from confronting one another. We have 
reason to believe that Sino-U.S. relations will continue to 
advance and improve as long as China can maintain its political 
situation and economic growth. As stated by Singapore's Lee 
Kuan-yew earlier this year, as MFN was renewed last year, it 
cannot be revoked this year, because the interests of the United 
States cannot be separated from China's cooperation year in and 
year out. This has become an irresistible trend.

"The United States Announces Delinkage of Trade From Human 
Rights, and Sino-American Relations Tend to Seek Common Ground 
While Reserving Differences"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- After 
judging the hour and sizing up the situation over the past year, 
U.S. President Clinton eventually announced the renewal of 
China's MFN status, and stated that in the future human rights 
issues would be delinked from trade and MFN. This shows that 
the U.S. previous policy of using human rights issues to put 
pressure on China has failed, and that China's foreign policy 
toward the United States "with good reason, advantages, and 
restraint" has gotten the upper hand in the present 
Sino-American diplomatic dispute. Sino-American relations in 
the future might move in a new direction of seeking mutual 
benefit, cooperation, and common ground while reserving 
differences, which China has always advocated. 
  In the past, China did not occupy a decisive position in the 
eyes of the United States. But now the United States has seen 
this Tai Shan [a symbol of great influence] with its own eyes. 
In his speech delivered on 27 May, Clinton admitted: "Our 
relationship with China is important to all Americans. We have 
significant interests in what happens there and what happens 
between us. China has an atomic arsenal and a vote and veto in 
the United Nations Security Council. It is a major element in 
Asian and global security. We share important interests, such 
as a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and sustaining the global 
environment. China is also the world's fastest-growing economy. 
Over $8 billion of U.S. exports to China last year supported 
over 150,000 American jobs..." Therefore, Clinton has decided to 
renew China's MFN status. 
  Before the above-mentioned announcement was made, it was 
reported that, while renewing China's MFN status, Clinton would 
increase customs duties on products manufactured by China's 
state-owned enterprises and military industrial enterprises and 
would use this as a stepping stone for personally overruling 
[fou jue 0694 0414] the seven executive orders on human rights. 
However, in his announcement, Clinton did not mention China's 
state-owned enterprises and military industrial enterprises at 
all. He only announced a ban on importing weapons, principally 
guns and ammunition, from China with total value of less that 
$200 million. Compared with the $31 billion of China's exports 
to the United States, such an amount is trivial and only 
represents a symbolic figure. 
  However, to placate congressmen and congresswomen who 
advocate human rights, Clinton also announced "extending the 
sanctions imposed as a result of the events in Tiananmen 
Square," and continued to refuse China permission to participate 
in the U.S. Trade and Development Aid Program, the Overseas 
Private Investment Companies Program, and the United States and 
Asian Environmental Partners Program, and denied licenses for 
exporting dual-use civilian products to China, among others. 
This shows that Clinton has not done things in a completely 
unrestrained manner, because he has still kept some room for 
maneuver. 
  Notwithstanding, Clinton has dared to go back on [fou ding 
0694 1353] his campaign promise to strengthen pressure on China 
as well as the executive order he issued after taking office on 
attaching human rights conditions to the renewal of China's MFN 
status. This has required great courage. In particular, while 
admitting that the policy of "linking" trade with human rights 
"no longer works," Clinton has acknowledged [ren tong 6126 0681] 
China's views on seeking common grounds while reserving 
differences, laying aside ideological differences such as human 
rights, and working for the goal of developing common interests. 
  People still remember that, at the summit meeting of 
Asian-Pacific countries held in Seattle in November last year, 
President Jiang Zemin told Clinton: As the Cold War has ended, 
we must focus our attention on economic development. China and 
the United States must increase mutual trust, seek common ground 
while reserving differences, and develop their common interests 
in economic and trade cooperation, international peace, and 
security. Handling relations between the two sides must be 
considered from the angle of the global arena, the future, and 
the 21st century. At that time, Clinton agreed with this view. 
  In Seattle, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also told 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher: "Sino-American relations 
must always be based on common interests, but not on the same 
social system, way of life, ideology, and values." With regard 
to Sino-American differences, he maintained that specific 
problems should be solved in specific ways. He opposed linking 
specific issues such as democracy, human rights, and 
proliferation of weapons with trade. He said that the two 
countries must stop debating about ideology, democracy, and 
human rights issues. They must seek common grounds while 
reserving differences, expand areas of agreement, and work for 
common interests, in particular economic interests. 
  Clinton's 27 May speech has shown that the United States is 
treating Sino-American relations from the high strategic plane. 
It has agreed to seek common ground while reserving differences 
and develop common interests. This is precisely what is 
required by the U.S. strategy of shifting its economic and 
diplomatic focus to Asia, because China is a major country in 
Asia as well as a locomotive of rapid economic development in 
the region. If U.S-China relations become deadlocked or are 
even brought to a confrontational stage, the United States' new 
Asian strategy can be nothing but empty talk. Therefore, 
Clinton's decision is being welcomed by various Asian countries.

"Most-Favored-Nation Status Issue Surpasses Bilateral 
Relations; There Are Still Many Latent Problems in Sino-U.S. 
Relations" 
  [Text] Professor Yuan Ming, director of Beijing 
University's International Relations Research Institute, has 
pointed out that the United States' decision to renew China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status and separate the MFN issue from 
human rights is good for Sino-U.S. relations. But she stressed 
that the settlement of the MFN issue does not mean sustained 
smoothness in Chinese-U.S. relations; instead, there are still 
many latent problems. 
  Yuan Ming pointed out: As a matter of fact, the MFN issue 
has gone beyond the scope of bilateral relations. When making a 
decision on this, it was impossible for the United States to 
consider it in isolation from other issues, and, to a great 
extent, the United States was also restricted by other countries. 
  She was of this opinion: Three forces made the Clinton 
administration unconditionally extend China's MFN status. The 
first was Europe and Japan. At a meeting of the 
U.S.-Japanese-European Trilateral Commission at the end of March 
this year, Japan and Europe strongly signaled relevant messages. 
The second were the multinational corporations, which have 
interests in the Chinese market. The third were China's 
neighbouring countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
and so on. 
  Yuan Ming pointed out that the settlement of the MFN issue 
is 
unquestionably good for Sino-U.S. relations and enables China 
and the United States to concentrate their attention on other 
important world affairs, including security in East Asia. But 
she stressed that the settlement of this year's MFN issue does 
not mean sustained smoothness in Chinese-U.S. relations. 
  There have been changes in China, and the United States is 
also experiencing change, but due to prolonged historical and 
cultural differences, she pointed out that there are latent 
problems in Sino-U.S. relations. 
  For example, theoretically, the United States acknowledges 
that China is important, but in reality it does not know how to 
proceed with this matter; U.S. companies in the Chinese market 
are not as competitive as Japanese, South Korean, Taiwan, or 
Hong Kong companies. 
  In addition, following the economic development of East 
Asia, 
the awakening of "East Asian self-confidence" is regarded as an 
anti-Western ideology by the United States. 
  She pointed out that China and the United States need to 
cooperate extensively in international affairs, which are linked 
to each other and cannot be viewed in isolation from each other, 
adding that China and the United States have many problems to 
resolve on security issues in Asia-Pacific in particular.

  [Text] Lanzhou, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Four days of trade talks 
in the U.S.A. this month by representatives of Gansu Province 
have resulted in agreements for considerable foreign investment 
in this north-west China province. 
  During the Los Angeles talks, the province's team signed 
with 
foreign partners 46 million U.S. dollars worth of contracts in 
imports and exports, together with seven technology agreements 
and eight promised projects, bringing in 135 million U.S. 
dollars and 204 million U.S. dollars, respectively. 
  Experts regarded the talks as a new page in Gansu's 
cooperation with the U.S. and other countries, such as Canada, 
Mexico and Argentina. 
  The inland province is a main energy and raw materials 
centre 
in China, abundant in resources like power and coal. Its 
non-ferrous products and chemical engineering machinery have 
nationwide brand recognition.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- The Mobil Oil Company 
was proud of its century-long presence in China, and would like 
to do business here for another hundred years. 
  Lucio Noto, chairman and chief executive of Mobil, said this 
recently in Beijing in an interview with XINHUA. 
  The company began its China business by establishing the 
first China representative office in Shanghai in 1894, and it 
was famous for introducing kerosene to China. 
  Noto, who came solely for the centenary celebrations, said 
that this was his first overseas trip since he took over the top 
slot last March. 
  "I want to express our willingness of furthering cooperation 
with China," he said, adding that Mobil would take the 
opportunity to probe the possibility of more cooperation. 
  The chairman disclosed that several cooperative projects 
were 
under discussion between Mobil and China, and it was possible 
that an agreement to establish a joint venture in north China's 
Tianjin would be reached within a few months. 
  "The setting up of joint ventures would both enable Mobil to 
provide better service to its Chinese customers, and benefit the 
development of China's economy," he said. "the cooperation is 
beneficial to both sides." 
  Noto also said that his company was interested in recovering 
and processing petroleum in China, including in the South China 
Sea and north-west China's Tarim Basin, and a team would be sent 
to China shortly to do research. 
  "We would not lose any good business opportunity here," he 
added. 
  To mark the 100th anniversary, Mobil has set up a fund of 
500,000 U.S. dollars to help develop China's education. 
  The company presented 100,000 U.S. dollars to the National 
Academy of Education Administration as the first installment of 
the fund, in support of the academy's efforts to upgrade the 
training facilities and programs for education administrators. 
  Noto said that his company had become one of the largest 
foreign suppliers in China, providing lubricating oil to various 
industrial fields of the country since it re-entered the Chinese 
market in 1974. 
  That same year this second largest oil company in the United 
States became the first foreign oil company to import Chinese 
oil, natural gas and fuel for aircraft into the USA. It was 
also the first foreign company selling oil products in China. 
  In 1983, it set up a filling station in south China's 
Shenzhen, thus becoming the first Western oil company of this 
kind. In 1986, the company began cooperation with Shanghai in 
producing lubricating oil for ocean shipping and automobiles.

  [Text] The Henan provincial government delegation headed 
by Governor Ma Zhongchen met in Washington, D.C., on 18 May with 
Mr. Martin, vice president of the World Bank, and Mr. Browning, 
president of the U.S. National Import and Export Bank. 
  The World Bank, which had previously provided loans to help 
Henan build some key projects, recently decided to provide more 
loans to Henan. The U.S. National Import and Export Bank has 
also decided to provide loans to help Henan purchase several 
Boeing 737 planes. 
  During the meeting, Governor Ma Zhongche spoke highly of the 
long-term cooperation between Henan Province and the two banks. 
He said: As one of China's communications hubs and bases for 
energy and raw materials, Henan boasts more investment 
opportunities for the outside world. Bilateral cooperation and 
exchanges between Henan and the World Bank and the U.S. National 
Import and Export Bank not only coincide with the shared 
interests of China and the United States, but also benefit both 
countries' economic development. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen said he hoped that more U.S. 
financiers 
and entrepreneurs would come to invest and build factories in 
Henan. Mr. Martin pledged to provide more loans to help Henan 
build more energy, communications, and infrastructure projects. 
Mr. Browning also promised to provide Henan with more loans in 
the years ahead to help Henan develop more key projects, large 
enterprises, and financial undertakings. 
  The Henan delegation headed by Governor Ma Zhongchen arrived 
in the State of Kansas on the evening of 15 May and was warmly 
received by Kansas Governor Benny. During their two-day stay in 
Kansas, the delegation visited a number of U.S. enterprises and 
companies, held a briefing in the governor's mansion to 
introduce Henan's investment opportunities to the Kansas 
business community, exchanged views with Kansans from all walks 
of life, and briefed Kansas business leaders on Henan's 
situation and projects. 
  At a cocktail party attended by more than 100 people from 
Kansas's economic, trade, and industrial circles, Governor Benny 
said: Governor Ma Zhongchen's current visit will enhance the 
friendly relations of cooperation between Kansas and Henan. Our 
bilateral exchanges and cooperation are conducive to our 
development and are needed to see continued growth. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen said at the cocktail party: I am 
looking forward to Governor Benny's visit to Henan. I believe 
that as long as both sides join hands and make concerted 
efforts, Henan and Kansas will surely be able to push 
cooperation onto a new stage. 
  Both governors expressed the hope that the U.S. and Chinese 
entrepreneurs at the cocktail party would contribute to the 
continued development of friendly and cooperative relations 
between Henan and Kansas. Governor Benny presented Governor Ma 
Zhongchen with a Kansas State emblem, while Governor Ma 
Zhongchen presented Governor Benny with a box of candies bearing 
Governor Benny's portrait and signature. Governor Benny gladly 
accepted the gift from Governor Ma Zhongchen and repeatedly 
expressed his thanks. 
  At the cocktail party, industrial, economic, and trade 
leaders from Kansas State and Henan Province conscientiously 
explored future bilateral cooperation prospects.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Entrepreneurs from China 
and Russia as well as some officials from relevant Chinese 
Government departments -- about 80 people in all -- gathered 
here this afternoon to talk about Sino-Russian cooperation. 
  Visiting Russian Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin spoke at 
the gathering. 
  He said that Russia and China are experiencing profound 
social changes and the two countries have taken different ways 
and measures in their own reforms due to their respective 
national and historic characteristics. He added that the two 
countries should learn from each other. 
  The tasks facing both Russia and China were similar in many 
aspects, he said, which holds possibilities for bilateral 
cooperation of mutual benefit. The Russian premier said that 
the complementary nature of the two countries, their resources 
and economies provides both with certain potential for effective 
bilateral cooperation. 
  He noted that bilateral relations have entered a new stage, 
which brings about a broad prospect for a constructive 
partnership in the next century. 
  Such relations, he said, well meet the basic national 
interest of the two countries and constitute an important 
element in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region as well as rest of the world. 
  Touching upon bilateral economic cooperation, he said that 
this was a complicated thing: on the one hand, the cooperation 
is vigorous; while on the other hand, there is great potential 
for its expansion. 
  He said that bilateral cooperative relations have to be 
shifted to a higher level in line with international standards, 
involving cooperation in production, investment and joint 
ventures. 
  He said that the good-neighborly cooperation between the two 
peoples will continue to be accelerated, for the sake of the two 
great nations, and peace and prosperity in Asia and the world. 
  Xu Dayou, vice-president of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade, also spoke briefly at the 
gathering.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429), written in Beijing on 25 May 1994: "China's 
Strategic Considerations in Developing Sino-Russian Relations"] 
  [Text] Striving for a peaceful environment favorable for 
economic development is an important principle upheld by Deng 
Xiaoping in foreign relations while implementing the reform and 
opening up policy on the mainland of China. In accordance with 
this, China has all along paid special attention to maintaining 
and developing relations of good-neighborliness, friendship, 
mutual benefit, and cooperation with the countries on its 
periphery. In its relations with big countries, China has not 
only upheld improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations on the 
basis of the three joint communiques, but has also in the past 
two years paid great attention to developing relations of 
friendship and cooperation with Russia. Russian President 
Yeltsin's visit to China at the end of the year before last, 
Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China a few days 
ago, and the scheduled visit to Russia in the fall of Jiang 
Zemin, CPC general secretary and concurrently state president, 
are new developments in Sino-Russian relations. 
<H5>  China's Party, Government, and Military Support Sino-Russian </H5>
Friendship 
  As informed sources in Beijing disclosed, the development of 
good-neighborly and friendly relations with Russia has won 
extensive support in the party, the government, and the 
military, including some party, government, and military elders. 
The reasons are: 1) Because of the disintegration of the 
former USSR, disputes over ideology which may lead to tense 
state-to-state relations between China and Russia no longer 
exist. 2) Since both China and Russia are carrying out reform, 
they need cooperation. 3) There is a history of friendship and 
cooperation between the Chinese and Russian peoples and the 
former USSR gave assistance to China in its construction in the 
1950's. 4) The establishment of relations of comprehensive 
cooperation between China and Russia is in the interests of the 
two countries and the two peoples and can contribute to curbing 
hegemony and power politics. 5) Sino-Russian cooperation can 
contain U.S. hegemonic strategy toward China. 6) Russia's 
advanced science, technology, and military equipment are 
precisely what China needs in its economy and national defense. 
  China's State Council has taken a positive attitude toward 
the development of relations of cooperation between China and 
Russia and not long ago worked out a three-year plan on 
providing aid for Russia in terms of light industry, foodstuffs, 
and textiles. 
  Out of consideration of the necessity of upgrading the 
equipment of the three armed services of China, at the beginning 
of March the Ministry of National Defense and the General Staff 
Headquarters put forward to the CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the Central Military Commission a plan for 
strengthening cooperation between the armed forces of China and 
Russia. The plan includes organizing regular mutual visits of 
high-level personalities of the armed forces, carrying out 
regular exchanges in military equipment and technology, carrying 
out regular exchanges of information on the security of the two 
countries, exchanging cadets of military academies, setting up 
associations for promoting cooperation and friendship, and so on. 
  Diplomats in Beijing hold that China has energetically 
developed its relations with Russia mainly out of the strategic 
consideration of contending with U.S. pressure on China each 
year on the issue of most-favored-nation trading status. As 
observed from the angle of the diplomatic strategy of 
"consolidating the periphery," Sino-Russian friendship and 
cooperation will benefit China's politics, economy, and military. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping's Tactics Toward Sino-Russian Relations </H5>
  However, according to informed sources, Deng Xiaoping has 
unique views as to the relations which should be established 
between China and Russia. 
  On the eve of Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit in the middle 
of April to countries of the CIS which separated from the former 
USSR, including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Kazakhstan in Central Asia, Deng Xiaoping mentioned to members 
of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee: "It is right to develop comprehensive 
relations with Russia, but it is necessary to have more 
observation and it is not advisable to be impatient to establish 
partnership or treaty relations. We uphold opening up and 
multilateral cooperation, but do not depend on (the other side); 
nor should we worry too much about what new relations will be 
established between the United States, Europe, and Russia. 
Russia has its own strategic plan. I think for quite a long 
time to come, there will not be major conflicts between China 
and Russia. Regarding economic aid to Russia, we should do what 
we are capable of and should openly state that in doing so, 
China is not aiming at a third country and does not seek any 
interests of its own." 
  As diplomats in Beijing point out, Deng Xiaoping's idea of 
pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace had already 
fully manifested itself at the end of the 1980's and the 
beginning of the 1990's. While talking about the international 
situation and China's policy toward it with several high-level 
political figures of the CPC on 4 September 1989, Deng said 
three things: "First, observing coolly; second, securing our 
position; third, dealing with things calmly." He laid special 
emphasis on "the necessity of keeping cool, keeping cool, and 
keeping cool, and of engrossing ourselves in doing a good job of 
attending to our own affairs." In accordance with the three 
things put forward by Deng, China's diplomacy stood the test of 
a changeable international situation in which Eastern Europe 
experienced drastic changes and the USSR disintegrated, and was 
able to resist the pressure of sanctions imposed by the West. 
Talking about China's diplomacy with some high-level political 
figures of the CPC again on 14 December 1990, Deng put forward 
that China should "accomplish something" in foreign affairs and 
said: "Unpredictable factors in the international situation are 
now numerous and contradictions become more and more 
unexpected." "Some countries of the Third World hope that China 
will act as the head. However, in no way should we act as the 
head and this is a fundamental national policy. We are 
incapable of acting as the head and we do not have sufficient 
strength for that. There is no advantage in acting as the head 
because we may lose the initiative in many aspects if we do so. 
China will stand on the side of the Third World forever. China 
will never seek hegemony and China will never act as the head. 
However, we cannot accomplish nothing on international issues 
and we should still accomplish something. What should we 
accomplish? I think we should energetically promote the 
establishment of a new international political and economic 
order. We fear nobody, but we offend nobody. We handle affairs 
in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence 
and we are firm in principle and stand." In these years, China 
has all along maneuvered among various groupings and developed 
in a flexible manner in the international arena in accordance 
with Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic ideas. 
<H5>  China Wants To Accomplish Something in the World </H5>
  According to informed sources, in handling its relations 
with 
Russia, China of course will not deviate from the guidance of 
Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic ideas. To be specific, China follows 
four principles: 
  1. Uphold good neighborliness, friendship, and peaceful 
coexistence; 
  2. Develop mutual-benefit cooperation, promote common 
prosperity; 
  3. Respect the choice of the people of each country and do 
not interfere in each other's internal affairs; 
  4. Respect independence and sovereignty and promote regional 
stability. 
  However, what has attracted people's attention is that 
people 
in charge of China's diplomatic, economic, and trade circles 
said a few days ago that China hoped the Russian prime 
minister's visit to China could promote development in depth of 
the relations between the two countries. This may imply that 
although it "will never act as a head" in the international 
arena, China wants to "accomplish something." 
  When the Cold War ended, most people thought the big 
triangular relations between China, the United States, and 
Russia no long existed. As a matter of fact, the end of the 
Cold War only implied the end of nuclear confrontation between 
the two superpowers, but it did not imply that the differences 
in interests and contradictions between countries would also 
disappear. So long as the differences in interests and 
contradictions between countries remain among China, the United 
States, and Russia, the strategic interaction relations among 
the three countries will remain. If China can make good use of 
such strategic interaction relations, and develop Sino-Russian 
relations, such a move will be conducive to the political 
stability of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in China and to 
preventing chaos in Mongolia and Central Asia, and will raise 
China's position in the big triangular relations of China, the 
United States, and Russia. This is because after Russia widens 
its diplomatic gap with the United States, it will inevitably 
draw close to China, and this will increase China's chips in 
bargaining with the United States, compelling the latter to keep 
its eyes on the overall pattern of global strategy in 
considering its policy toward China, instead of merely making 
use of the lever of human rights. In this way, the issue of 
giving most-favored-nation trading status to China can be solved 
more easily, and the United States will also attach greater 
importance to the strategic position of U.S.-Chinese relations 
and will not lightly have confrontation with China.
