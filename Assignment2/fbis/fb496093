  [Text] Moscow, May 27 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin 
said today that Russia has no extra and unnecessary land and 
will firmly defend the integrity of its territory. 
  The Russian president made these remarks while explaining 
his 
concept of defense on the Russian border at a frontier force 
festival here, the ITAR-TASS news agency reported today. 
  Yeltsin pointed out that Russia has no territorial claims 
over other countries and favors civilized settlements of border 
disputes. 
  Russia is a young nation and there is still a lot to be done 
before it completes demarcation of borders with neighboring 
countries, ITAR-TASS cited him as saying. 
  Yeltsin stressed that Russia's border should become an 
impassable barrier for terrorists, drug-traffickers, smugglers 
and illegal immigrants. 
  The priority for frontier guards is to cope with armed 
provocation, he added. 
  But he stressed that Russia favors peaceful settlements of 
border disputes and will resort to force only under 
extraordinary situations. 
  The border should not become an obstacle for international 
cooperation and exchange, he added. 
  On border defense, he said that because Russia's relations 
with neighboring countries vary with political situation, Russia 
should treat different countries with different approaches.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Japanese police today 
arrested a member of a right-wing organization after he fired a 
gun at the ceiling of a hotel lobby in an abortive attack on 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
said today. 
  Hosokawa, who escaped unhurt, was on his way home from a 
party at the Keio Plaza Hotel in central Tokyo marking the 
establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the Japan New Party which 
he heads. 
  Police identified the attacker as Masakatsu Nozoe, who is 
52. 
The shot missed the target when plain-clothes policemen slapped 
the gunman on the hands as he held a revolver aimed at Hosokawa, 
KYODO quoted witnesses as saying. 
  But police later quoted Nozoe as saying that initially he 
was 
aiming at Hosokawa, but then decided to fire at the ceiling, the 
news agency said. 
  It also said the assailant later told police that he had 
become upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's invasion of 
its Asian neighbors during World War II and with his economic 
policies. 
  As soon as the attack occurred police officers subdued the 
assailant while plain-clothes officers rushed the former premier 
out of the hotel and into a waiting car. 
  A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife 
as he was being escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is 
still there. Please..." 
  Hosokawa, who resigned last month over his dubious financial 
dealings, has been threatened by rightist groups since he took 
office last August because of his remarks condemning Japan's 
wartime atrocities.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today denounces a statement by 
South Korea that the north-south joint declaration on 
denuclearization has become invalid. 
  South Korea's Deputy Premier and Minister of National 
Unification Yi Hong-ku said on may 23 that the declaration on 
denuclearization "has become invalid in actuality." 
  A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification 
of the Fatherland said that "the arbitrary abrogation of the 
joint declaration vital to the nation is a very grave challenge 
which endangers peace in the country and the security of the 
nation." 
  "They (the South Korean Government) will have to bear full 
responsibility for all the consequences arising from their 
nullification of the declaration," the KCNA NEWS AGENCY quoted 
the spokesman as saying.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and a team of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have failed to reach a 
final agreement on the replacement of fuel rods at a nuclear 
power station in the DPRK. 
  A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday [28 May] 
that 
the DPRK will go ahead on its own with the replacement of the 
fuel rods at its 5-megawatt experimental atomic power station. 
  He said the DPRK Government will continue to work for the 
transparency of nuclear development and for the settlement of 
the nuclear issue through DPRK-U.S. dialogue. 
  The DPRK and IAEA teams held working consultations between 
May 25 and 27 over technical matters concerning the replacement 
of the spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. 
  During the consultations, the DPRK side suggested that the 
DPRK keep the spent fuel rods under the supervision of the IAEA. 
In case it undergoes routine and ad hoc inspections with a 
package solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the 
U.S. in the future, DPRK would let the IAEA check the spent fuel 
rods. 
  The DPRK and IAEA delegations also discussed the method of 
preserving the technical possibilities of measuring the spent 
fuel rods by the IAEA, the spokesman said. 
  He said the IAEA demanded that the DPRK submit a written 
report on the matter and the IAEA will study the theoretical 
feasibility and security of the method proposed by the DPRK side. 
  At the negotiation, the agency raised the method of selected 
and separated preservation of fuel rods, the spokesman said. 
  But the DPRK believed it is not acceptable in principle 
because it is essentially an inspection falling under the 
category of ad hoc inspection and going beyond the unique status 
of the DPRK following its temporary suspension of withdrawal 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he stressed. 
  Although no final agreement has been reached, he said, the 
DPRK promised to respond any time to negotiation that might be 
proposed by the IAEA side in future.

<F P=106> [By Wang Liming (3769 7812 2494) ] </F>
  [Text] Shenyang, 31 May (XINHUA)--Dandong City in Liaoning 
Province is giving play to its geographical advantages and is 
rapidly developing border trade with the DPRK. In the first 
four months of this year, the volume of border trade exceeded 
$17 million, an increase of 93 percent over the same period last 
year. 
  Dandong City is located in the northern end of the mainland 
coastline of China, and faces the DPRK's Sinuiju City across the 
Yalu Jiang. It is one of the largest border cities in China. 
In 1988, Dandong City was named as one of China's open cities, 
and in 1992, the State Council approved the establishment of the 
Dandong Border Economic Cooperation Zone. After that, Dandong 
City made use of its favorable geographical position of being 
adjacent to Korea and the doubly favorable policies for coastal 
and border areas and has increased border trade with the DPRK 
year after year. In 1993, the volume of Dandong's border trade 
with the DPRK exceeded $52 million. 
  In Dandong's border trade with the DPRK, Dandong mainly 
exports grain, pork, beef, textiles, chemical raw materials, 
household electric appliances, and light industrial goods to the 
Korean side, and mainly imports steel products, timber, aquatic 
products, minerals, and silkworm cocoons from the Korean side. 
  As Dandong's opening up to the outside world continues its 
expansion, the structure of trade with the DPRK has also 
expanded from the previous sole pattern of barter trade to 
plural forms of cash-based trade, processing trade, entrepot 
trade, and the tourist trade. At present, there are more than 
170 business companies engaged in trade with the DPRK. Trade 
partners on the Korean side extend from Sinuiju to such interior 
cities as Pyongyang and Wonsan. There is economic and trade 
cooperation with an increasing number of the DPRK's large, 
state-level commercial institutions.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam Monday [30 May] asked his ministers to prepare for 
every possible contingency after the breakdown of talks between 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Kim was addressing a security-related cabinet meeting at 
which various means of coping with the DPRK's nuclear issue were 
discussed. 
  The DPRK and the IAEA reached no agreement during their 
talks 
in Pyongyang last week over refueling at the DPRK's 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor. 
  The IAEA claimed in a statement that the DPRK had rejected 
the IAEA's proposal for inspection to ensure that no fuel was 
being diverted to make nuclear weapons. 
  Monday's meeting was attended by South Korean Prime Minister 
Yi Yong-tok, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the National 
Unification Board Yi Hong-ku, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and other senior government 
officials. 
  The meeting decided that South Korea would strengthen 
cooperation with the countries around the Korean peninsula -- 
the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- and study possible 
action in case the nuclear issue is referred to the United 
Nations Security Council. 
  "The efforts of the government and the international 
community to peacefully solve the North Korean nuclear problem 
are facing a grave challenge as Pyongyang has ignored the 
international community's demands and pushed for replacement of 
fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon," President Kim 
told the meeting. 
  Kim urged the DPRK to immediately stop discharging the fuel 
rods, saying that "the selection, storage and measurement of 
fuel rods are indispensable to securing the transparency of past 
nuclear activities as well as ascertaining the non-diversion of 
nuclear material." 
  The meeting also decided that South Korea will continue to 
try to solve the nuclear issue through dialogue ahead of the 
regular meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors scheduled for 
June 6. 
  The South Korean Government plans to hold a unification and 
security policy coordination meeting this week to draw up 
detailed measures following Monday's meeting, official sources 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 30 (XINHUA) -- South Korea Monday [30 
May] hailed the United States' decision to renew 
most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China as a positive 
influence on Asia-Pacific trade. 
  "The Government of the Republic of Korea welcomes the U.S. 
decision to extend China's MFN status as a very practical 
action," a Foreign Ministry official said here. 
  The decision will enhance trade activities in the 
Asia-Pacific region and positively influence the launching of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO), the official said. 
  On May 26, U.S. President Bill Clinton renewed MFN status 
for 
China, declaring there will be no link between future MFN 
renewals and human rights.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Ambassador 
to Malaysia Qian Jinchang hosted a reception here this evening

  The visits of the state and government leaders to each 
other's country in recent years "have resulted in a new high in 
the history of Malaysia-China relations", Mohamed Zahir said. 
  Qian said: "looking forward to the future, we are more 
convinced that the establishment of long-term and stable

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Ding Baozhong: "Sino-Malaysian Friendly Ties </F>
Reach New Level"] 
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China and Malaysia 
are reaping the fruits of common efforts to forge friendship and 
cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations on 
May 31, 1974. 
  As the Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir put it, 
links between the two countries stretched a long way back, but 
it is only over the last two decades that the bilateral 
relationship has reached a new level of understanding and 
cooperation. 
  "In the last five years or so, bilateral relations have 
increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation," he 
added. 
  The visits by the state and government leaders to each 
other's country deepened mutual understanding and trust and 
pushed the relations into a new stage of all-round development. 
  Earlier this month, Mahathir visited China for the third 
time. During the visit he met with President Jiang Zemin and 
Prime Minister Li Peng respectively, exchanging views on the 
bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern. 
  Since Mahathir's first visit to China in 1985, the two 
governments have signed ten agreements including those on trade, 
aviation, marine transportation, investment guarantee, avoidance 
of double taxation, establishment of the joint economic and 
trade commission, information and science and technology. 
  Two-way trade has been recording a double-digit growth since 
1987 with 1993 seeing a 21 percent increase to 1.79 billion U.S. 
dollars from 1.475 billion U.S. dollars in 1992. China has 
stood as one of the biggest buyers of palm oil of Malaysia, the 
world's largest producer. 
  Two-way investment has covered a wide range of industries 
with a considerable expansion in volume and is moving toward 
internationalized cooperation. 
  Incomplete statistics show that the number of Malaysians 
travelling to China rose from 11,200 in 1989 to 125,200 in 1993 
while the number of the Chinese touring Malaysia surged from 
9,000 in 1990 to 85,000 in 1993. 
  Last year the two governments agreed to set up 
consulates-general in each other's country. The Malaysian 
Consulate-General in Guangzhou started business by the end of 
last year while the Chinese one will be opened in Kuching, 
Sarawak soon. 
  "On many major international issues, we are delighted to see 
that our two countries share extensive common understanding and 
have been maintaining good cooperation. We highly value the 
Malaysian Government for its upholding justice and speaking out 
to safeguard the rights and interests of the developing 
countries in the international affairs and for actively 
promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of 
this region," Chinese Ambassador Qian Jinchang said recently. 
  "We have full confidence in the future development of the 
bilateral relationship. We believe that the development of 
long- term, stable and friendly relations between China and 
Malaysia on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence, 
is not only in conformity with the fundamental interests of our 
two peoples, but also beneficial to the peace, stability and 
development of this region," he added.

Investment Forum '94, the largest ever held in Australia, opened 
in Melbourne, the second largest city in Australia, today. 
  The Chinese delegation, consisting of more than 100 
businessmen from China's 20 provinces and cities, was led by Gu

  [Text] Melbourne, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Both Chinese and 
Australian trade officials have today expressed their 
satisfaction with the sound development of bilateral economic 
and trade links at the China Trade and Investment Forum '94. 
  The forum, the largest ever held in Australia, was opened in 
Melbourne, the second largest city in Australia, today. 
  Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan said that the forum 
"signifies the great progress and development in economic ties 
between Australia and China in recent years." 
  He pointed out that the strength of such economic and trade 
links "is the result of some hard work by our governments and 
business." 
  McMullan said that the export-oriented sector of Australia's 
economy has "enjoyed the benefits of linking into China's 
economic development." 
  The trade minister also announced that he will lead a 
business delegation to China next September to continue to 
facilitate high- level contacts. 
  He also said that Australia will open four Austrade (the 
Australian Trade Commission) trade and investment offices in 
China and Australia has already had trade offices in Hangzhou, 
Shanghai and Guangzhou. "Australia-China trade and investment 
relations stand at the threshold of a significant mutually 
beneficial expansion," McMullan said. 
  He stressed that the Australian Government "is committed to 
providing even greater impetus for the bilateral trade 
relationship." 
  Gu Yongjiang, vice-minister of China's Ministry for Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, brief the forum on the deepening 
of China's economic reforms and opening to the outside world. 
  Gu led a Chinese delegation, consisting of more than 100 
businessmen from China's 20 provinces and cities, who have 
brought with them over 500 projects, valued at seven billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  He said that beginning from this year, the Chinese 
Government 
has implemented a series of significant reform measures in the 
fields of fiscal and taxation system, banking, investment, 
foreign exchange and foreign trade. "This shows that the 
reform of China's economic system has entered into an important 
phase of overall progress with breakthrough in key sectors," Gu 
added. On the Sino-Australian economic and trade links, the 
vice- minister said that the two countries have had a long 
history of economic and trade cooperation. 
  The two-way trade between the two countries reached a record 
high of three billion U.S. dollars last year, representing an 
increase of 29 percent over the previous year, according to 
China's official figures. 
  He said that by the end of last year, China has had approved 
1,310 projects involving Australian investment, with a total 
contracted value amounting to 1.25 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Australia has become the 9th largest foreign investor in 
China. 
  Talking of the prospect for future Sino-Australian economic 
and trade ties, Gu said that a sound development will be the 
only trend for Sino-Australian economic and trade relations. 
  He cited four reasons to support the view: 
  -- The two economies have a strong complementarity; 
  -- Both the Chinese and Australian Governments attach great 
importance to the promotion of the bilateral economic and trade 
ties; 
  -- Both countries are working for readjusting their economic 
development strategy at the moment; and 
  -- The experience from past trade contacts and investment 
projects will serve as a good guide to future success in the 
bilateral trade and economic ties. 
  Gu pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region is a region that 
"enjoys the most dynamic economic growth and the 21st century 
will no doubt belong to the Asia-Pacific region." 
  "China and Australia should join hands and cooperate more 
closely to maker greater contributions to the prosperity of the 
region," he said. 
  The forum will last for two days in Melbourne and will then 
be moved to Australia's largest city of Sydney next week.

  [Text] Melbourne, June 1 (XINHUA) -- A joint press 
statement on Australia-China economic cooperation was released 
here today, praising highly of the China trade and investment 
forum being held here. 
  The press statement pointed out that the forum, the largest 
ever held in Australia, "reflected the importance the Australian 
and Chinese Governments placed on developing the bilateral trade 
and economic relationship." 
  The joint press statement was released at the forum by 
Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan and visiting 
Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang of China's Ministry for Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation. 
  Gu led a largest Chinese trade delegation, consisting of 
more 
than 100 businessmen from 20 out of China's 30 provinces and 
municipalities, who have brought with them over 500 projects, 
worth 7 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The two officials held that the forum has created an 
opportunity to deepen and strengthen the economic relationship 
between the two countries." 
  The two-way trade has increased rapidly in recent years. In 
1993, the trade volume between the two countries enjoyed a 
record high of 3 billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent over the 
previous year, according to China's official figures. 
  Latest Australian official figures indicated that China has 
become the 6th largest trading partner of Australia and 
Australia has become the 10th in China's largest trading partner 
list. 
  The two sides agreed that the current trade and investment 
levels were only a small proportion of what would be achieved as 
the economic relations matured. 
  "The development of the economic relationship would be 
assisted by trade and economic regions both countries were 
pursuing and by the formalization of China's status in the 
GATT," the statement said. 
  The two ministers reaffirmed that in line with the 
understanding contained in the Australia-China Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement, the two sides will continue to 
  -- Take a purposeful and systematic approach to removing 
trade and investment barriers; 
  -- Maintain MFN as a basis for trade between the two 
countries; 
  -- See an early settlement of China's GATT status; 
  -- Encourage closer integration of mineral, agricultural and 
raw materials processing sectors; and 
  -- Encourage further visits by ministerial-level trade 
delegations and senior government and business officials. 
  The two officials believed that economic complementarities 
between the two countries have created potential for ventures 
and projects in areas of raw materials and mineral process as 
well as manufacturing and services.

municipal government and trade delegation headed by Beijing 
mayor Li Qiyan is paying a four-day goodwill visit to Paris from 
12 to 15 May. So far, the delegation has signed contracts and

  The Industry and Commerce Federation of Paris gave a welcome 
lunch party at noon today in honor of the Beijing delegation. 
The deputy speaker of Metropolitan Paris' national assembly, 
(Brahm) [bu la mu 1580 2139 1191], attended the party. 
  Addressing the party, Mayor Li Qiyan said: China's reform

enterprises have been established in Beijing, the value of 
investment contracts amounts to $11.3 billion, and the value of 
technology import projects has reached $2.5 billion. In 1993,

110 times [as received]. In 1993, Beijing municipality's 
exports to France were valued at $24.9 million, while French 
investment in Beijing totaled $75 million. 
  Li Qiyan noted that since 1987, when Beijing and Paris 
established friendly city relations, economic ties and trade as 
well as cultural exchanges between the two cities have developed 
constantly. He hoped his current visit would help enhance 
cooperation between the two cities in all areas and contribute 
to Sino-French friendship. 
  An official in charge of the delegation told this reporter 
that after its arrival in Paris the Beijing municipal delegation 
has signed contracts and agreements with French enterprises on a 
few cooperation projects, among which is a contract signed

Group. According to the agreement, the total investment value 
of the project will be $29 million, with the French partner 
contributing 65 percent of investment, while the Chinese partner 
provides 35 percent. Currently, the French partner has paid up 
$7.8 million as a portion of the shares, and the first phase of 
the project is expected to officially begin operations by July. 
  China Packaging Industry Development Company Limited and the 
(Saint Gobain) [0857 1122 0202] Company yesterday signed a 
cooperation agreement on an investment of $30 million to

  [Text] Valletta, 26 May (XINHUA) -- When interviewed by 
this reporter before his departure for China at the Prime 
Minister's Office on 26 May, Maltese Prime Minister Fenech Adami 
said "Malta and China have maintained a very good relationship 
since their establishment of diplomatic ties. The purpose of my 
upcoming visit to China is to explore ways to make the bilateral 
relationship even better." 
  Fenech Adami recalled his first visit to China in 1978 when 
he was the leader of Malta's opposition party. He said: "It was 
at that time that I began to realize the importance of 
developing the Maltese-Chinese relationship." He said Malta and 
China may further explore means of cooperation in other areas, 
including economics and finance. He added that he would 
exchange views with Chinese leaders over bilateral relations and 
over mulilateral international cooperation while in Beijing. 
  Discussing the domestic economy, Adami said that Malta is 
readjusting its economic structure and that Malta has scored 
positive results in the areas of developing the economy, foreign 
trade, and in raising the people's living standards. He said 
that while Western Europe's economy is still in a downturn, 
Malta is enjoying continued economic growth. Its unemployment 
rate is only 4 percent. Both its tourism and electronic 
industry have achieved gratifying developments. He also 
stressed that Malta is striving to join the European Union, 
which is very important to Malta economically and politically. 
  Turning to the situation in the Mediterranean, Adami said: 
"As a country situated in the middle of the Mediterranean, Malta 
stands for promoting cooperation with other countries in the 
region and for establishing a permanent organization that will 
serve as a place for dialogue and cooperation for the countries 
in the region." 
  He also noted that the situation in the Mediterranean 
sometimes becomes critical or even very turbulent. However, as 
a whole, a situation that is cause for undue concern has yet to 
develop. Still, there is a need to keep a close watch on the 
development of negative trends.

  [Text] Lisbon, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Guangying, Chinese 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee vice 
chairman, met with Durao Barroso, Portuguese secretary of state 
for foreign affairs, here today. 
  The Portuguese foreign secretary said: Exchange of visits 
between senior leaders of Portugal and China has increased 
noticeably in recent years. It is an honor for Portugal to have 
received Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Vice 
President Rong Yiren, and the current visit by Vice Chairman 
Wang Guangying and an NPC delegation led by him. These 
high-level contacts have strengthened the good relations between 
our two countries. 
  He added: The relationship with China is a focal point of 
Portugal's foreign affairs. To develop Portuguese-Chinese 
relations is neither an interim choice nor temporary demand. It 
is the Portuguese Government's policy to develop long-term 
stable relations with China; as well as the common goal of both 
Portuguese ruling and opposition parties to expand ties with 
China. 
  In reply, Vice Chairman Wang Guangying said: China and 
Portugal share common interests as both are devoted to 
developing their domestic economies and safeguarding world 
peace. The two countries, which have cooperated well on the 
Macao issue and conducted friendly consultations to ensure 
Macao's smooth transition, will set their eyes on developing 
friendly cooperation in various fields in the future. 
  The Portuguese foreign secretary appreciated Wang 
Guangying's 
remarks, saying the Portuguese Government has attached great 
importance to the process of transferring Macao's sovereignty to 
China. Prime Minister Silva's recent visit to China has 
contributed to this process.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the Chinese 
Government is keen to develop friendly ties and cooperation with 
Slovenia. 
  In his talks with Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze Peterle here this morning, 
Qian said that China is ready to promote bilateral cooperation 
in all spheres. 
  Lojze Peterle arrived here Tuesday [31 May] evening on a 
six-day official visit to China. 
  There is no obstacle to the development of Sino-Slovenian 
cooperation, Qian said. 
  During Qian's September visit to Slovenia, the two countries 
signed a number of cooperation agreements and the first session 
of a Sino-Slovenian Commission on Economy and Trade was held. 
  Slovenia's prime minister is to visit China within the year, 
which will coincide with the second session of the commission. 
  These are all signs of the gradual deepening of the 
all-round 
ties between China and Slovenia, Qian noted. 
  China adopts a positive attitude towards developing economic 
and trade links with Slovenia, and there existed a good basis 
and potential for this cooperation in the past, Qian said. 
  To fully tap this potential, the two governments should 
encourage their enterprises to contact each other more 
frequently and adopt more ways of cooperation, he said, adding 
that the sister-city relationship should also be reinforced. 
  He expressed the hope that the contacts between Slovenian 
businessmen, who are here with the deputy prime minister, and 
their Chinese counterparts will bear positive results. 
  Peterle said that he was happy to be here, and that his trip 
would deepen bilateral ties. 
  He agreed with Qian that the two countries should adopt 
various forms to propel their cooperation to a new high. 
  The visit to China by Slovenia's prime minister later in the 
year, and the meeting of the Economic and Trade Commission of 
the two countries would lay a solid basis for further 
cooperation between the two countries, Peterle said. 
  After the talks, Qian and Peterle, on behalf of their 
governments, signed an agreement on the mutual exemption of 
diplomatic and service passport visas. 
  Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo and Slovenian 
Ambassador to China Ivan Senicar [name as received] were present 
at the talks and the signing ceremony.

  [Text] Santiago, 23 May (XINHUA) -- During a meeting with 
Liu Jiachen, Vice President of the Chinese Supreme People's 
Court, at the presidential office this afternoon, Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle underscored the great 
importance that Chile attaches to developing friendly relations 
and cooperation with China. 
  President Frei said: The Chinese judicial delegation's visit 
is continuing the series of visits that have taken place between 
Chile and China. Former President Patricio Aylwin Azocar, 
during his visit to China in 1992, laid a sound foundation for 
the development of relations between Chile and China. He said 
he personally would continue to work for the further development 
of relations between the two countries. 
  He said: Chile attaches great importance to developing its 
relations with China and to learning from China's experience in 
economic development. He expressed the belief that it was of 
"crucial importance" to both countries to further develop 
bilateral relations. 
  Vice President Liu Jiachen said: Relations between the two 
countries have developed continuously since China and Chile 
established diplomatic relations more than 20 years ago. He 
expressed the hope that the visit would further increase 
contacts between the two countries, especially between their 
judicial circles. 
  This morning, the Chinese judicial delegation held separate 
meetings with Chilean Supreme Court President Marcos Aburto and 
Chilean Justice Minister Maria Soledad Alvear. In the 
afternoon, it also met with Chilean Senate President Valdes. 
  The Chinese judicial delegation led by Liu Jiachen arrived 
here this morning for a five-day official visit to Chile. It is 
the first Chinese judicial delegation to visit Chile since the 
two countries established diplomatic relations.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] Reform through labor is still an essential part of 
China's prison system. CRI's [China Radio International's] (Li 
Ben) has filed a two-part story on the (?real scenario) behind 
China's prisons and the life of prisoners in prison farms. 
Here's Dong Jun with the first story in our series: 
  [Begin recording] [Dong Jun] China believes that criminals 
can become better people and China always tries to give 
prisoners a new life. Our reporter talked with Zhang Xiufu, the 
vice minister of justice. 
  [Zhang speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation 
read by Dong] Zhang Xiufu said: There are many ways to reform 
prisoners. For example, all criminals receive political, moral, 
and law education while in jail. China wants the whole society 
to work together for this endeavor and the first step is labor 
reform. At present, China has more than 1 million convicts in 
about 600 prisons scattered all over the nation. These 
prisoners are engaged in various forms of labor, such as working 
on farms and in factories. 
  Zhang Xiufu said only through labor can criminals be tamed. 
He said one of the main motives for crime is to gain without 
working; through labor, a prisoner will cultivate a work habit, 
know to cherish his own creation, and form a sense of 
discipline. Zhang said: In 1950's, China successfully reformed 
Japanese war criminals and the last feudal emperor, Pu Yi. They 
all began a new life after working for a while in a farm. 
  Wang Minbing is an official in charge of prison affairs. He 
said: All their work is to prepare prisoners for their future. 
The prisoners have many opportunities to attend courses and 
learn skills in their work. These skills will be essential when 
they look for jobs in the future. Every year, more than 200,000 
prisoners obtain a diploma confirmed by educational departments 
or vocational skill certificate granted by labor departments. 
  Wang Minbing explained: [Wang speaking in Mandarin fading 
into English translation read by Dong] Wang said the 
correctional administrators must be warm-hearted to the convicts 
and let them see hope. Their goal is to transform the prisoners 
into better men and women. Wang said it is a humanitarian deed 
to the prisoners, their families, and society. Wang Minbing 
said: Only 6 to 8 percent of those released after serving 
sentences commit crime again within two years. Ninety percent 
are transformed into law-abiding citizens. 
  However, the living conditions in some jails are sometimes 
not good. Vice Minister of Justice Zhang Xiufu said: This is 
because China is still a developing country and the people's 
average standard of living is low. In fact, the prisoners' cost 
of living is similar to that of ordinary citizens. He believes 
the situation in prison will be improved along with the 
country's economic growth. [end recording] 
  That was Dong Jun with the report on China's reform through 
labor prison. Our reporter (Li Ben) also visited (?Xiyuan) 
Prison in Shanghai to talk to the inmates there. Tomorrow at 
the same time, you will hear some prisoners talk about their 
lives behind bars.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] A CRI [China Radio International] reporter (Li Ben) 
visited the (?Xiyuan) Prison in Shanghai last week and talked 
with some prisoners there about their lives behind bars. Dong 
Jun has the second part of our series on prisons in China: 
  [Recording begins with a Chinese song fading into Dong Jun's 
voice in English] This song was written by inmates in the 
(?Xiyuan) Prison; the lyrics express not only regret for the 
past, but also determination to become a better person. 
  Singer Li Haibo has been here for five years. He was found 
guilty of forgery and embezzlement in 1989. Now he is a member 
of the New Life Song and Dance Troupe in the prison. Fifty 
other inmates are also members of the group. Li Haibo said the 
correction officials believe music cures the wounds in the 
prisoners' hearts. 
  [Li is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into 
English 
translation] It may sound impossible that one can learn music 
in jail, but we are doing it. Music has been a good influence 
on me. I believe if I always try my best and perform well, the 
government will reduce my sentence. 
  [Dong] There are altogether more than 3,000 inmates in this 
prison. Besides the song and dance troupe, many prisoners have 
joined art classes to learn sculpture, painting, and handicraft 
making. Others study computer science, accounting, and English. 
The prison administrator said they had been organizing these 
activities for 11 years in the hope that prisoners can benefit 
from them in the future. However, the main activity for the 
inmates is labor. It is believed that through labor, the 
prisoners will form good work habits and the sense of discipline 
and cooperation. 
  In the (?Xiyuan) Prison, inmates make clothing. 
Twenty-year-old Wang Jiang is serving a four-year sentence for 
burglary. Our reporter talked with him, while he was making 
prison uniforms in the factory. 
  [Reporter] Is this hard work? 
  [Wang is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into 
English translation] It's OK, not very harsh. 
  [Reporter] How many hours do you work everyday? 
  [Wang] Eight hours a day. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about working in prison? 
  [Wang] It's very good for me. I was spoiled by my parents 
and hated work. But now I know what life means; it will do me 
good when I go back to society. 
  [Dong] Mai Lianhua is the warden of the prison. He said the 
meals of the inmates are scientifically arranged. [Mai is 
briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into English 
translation] We pay a lot of attention to the nutrition of the 
food. We are supplying vegetable, meat, and other staple food 
according to the needs of the body. 
  [Dong] Mai Lianhua said there are five dishes provided for 
each meal. Everyday, the menu is put up for the prisoners to 
see. Most of them have regular meals; male inmates over 60 and 
female over 55 can enjoy special meals. Muslims have their own 
cafeteria. Everyone will receive a special meal on his or her 
birthday. However, the rooms for the inmates here are rather 
crowded. Built in 1901 by British colonizers, the prison is 
(?already) small, and Shanghai is well-known for its housing 
problems. In this city of 12 million, even law-abiding citizens 
don't have a big enough place to live. 
  Twenty-two-year-old Xie Ying has been an inmate here for 
three years. [Xie is heard briefly speaking in Mandarin fading 
into English translation] The food here is alright. The room is 
very small; there are two people who share one room. It's OK. 
We can take a shower everyday in the summer. 
  [Dong] There's a warden hotline in the prison. Inmates may 
call the warden when they have problems. They can also write to 
government offices if they think they are being treated 
unfairly. A psychological counseling office has also been set 
up for the inmates. It opens twice a week. The prisoners' 
conversations with doctors are kept confidential. 
  Eleven foreign convicts are also inmates here. They are from 
Britain, the U.S., Germany, Pakistan, and Myanmar [Burma]. Most 
of them are convicted of drug-related offenses. They study 
Chinese laws and language while in jail. Some of them teach the 
Chinese inmates English. Their living allowances are 20 percent 
higher than a Chinese prisoner and all of them have their own 
cells. 
  (Lachlan Campbell) is from the United Kingdom. He was 
sentenced to 15 years for marijuana trafficking two years ago. 
He has learned how to make artistic masks while in prison. 
When asked if he's being treated fair, (Campbell) had this to 
say: 
  [(Campbell)] For sure, for sure. One hundred percent sure. 
The treatment here is very fair. With the warden, with the 
education [words indistinct] They always try to help us. At 
the beginning we weren't sure, but when warden comes out with 
Mr. Dong and Mr. (Jin), they always offer assistance. Now that 
we understand it, we have been here two years, now we understand 
it. 
  [Dong] (Lachlan Campbell) also had this to say to his 
family: 
  [(Campbell)] I want to say to my family that I hope to see 
you in the not so distant future. Thank you. That would be 
very nice and tell them that I'm in good health and I play 
regular football. We have lots of football competitions and I 
enjoy playing football very much. 
  [Dong] For all the prisoners, going home is their biggest 
wish. The prison is a place for them, not only to repent and 
correct their mistakes, but also to prepare for the new life in 
the future. For China Radio International, I am Dong Jun. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Yushan (7627 6276 2619) from Beijing: </F>
"Various Factions Take Action To Prevent Disturbances To 
Solidify Themselves"] 
  [Text] It seems that China's hardliners are again gaining 
ground. Many people believe that this has something to do with 
Deng Xiaoping's recent state of health. There are many 
indications that Deng's health is deteriorating and that he has 
further detached himself from state affairs, though Chinese 
official quarters and his relatives repeatedly dismiss such 
reports as groundless. This is a recent development which 
warrants attention. 
  All intra-party factions are trying to keep the situation 
under control to capitalize on Deng's still being alive. In the 
meantime they will take the opportunity to consolidate their 
strength. Therefore they can reach a consensus on the question 
of maintaining stability and even on pursuing a tough policy to 
suppress civilian rebellious activities. The situation in the 
period immediately before Mao Zedong's death in 1976 is a case 
in point. At that time both "the gang of four," and Ye Jianying 
and Hua Guofeng were loath to see disturbances created by 
civilians for fear that such disturbances would affect their 
plans and the Communist Party's position as the ruling party, so 
they could unanimously agree to suppress the "5 April Tiananmen 
unrest." The present situation is similar to that in 1976. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping's Health Is Really in Question </H5>
  The discussion of Deng's state of health may remind many 
people of the television pictures of Deng's public appearances 
in Shanghai during the last Spring Festival period broadcast by 
Chinese Central Television. According to a reliable source, the 
Shanghai Television crew responsible for shooting Deng's 
activities had intended to take as good pictures as they could 
so that they could fulfilled the task assigned to them by 
Chinese Central Television, but they found it difficult to 
accomplish the task because they could not even record a 
complete sentence by Deng. In the end Shanghai Television could 
not but deliver all the pictures they took to Chinese Central 
Television, which in turn submitted them to the Deng Xiaoping 
Office for inspection. So the pictures shown by Chinese Central 
Television were actually those selected by the Deng Xiaoping 
Office. From this people can imagine what Deng's state of 
health was like at that time. 
  The source continued: Deng's family members emphasize that 
Deng is in good shape and that he is not in hospital. This is 
correct, because even if Deng fell ill, doctors would stay at 
his home to take care of him, as was the case with Mao Zedong. 
The reports about Deng's health began spreading in early March. 
  The source added: However, that Deng is in poor health does 
not mean he is as good as dead. Chinese leaders have excellent 
methods of keeping fit and prolonging their lives. Chen Yun has 
survived serious illnesses three times over the last five years. 
Is he not still kicking now? Having had his blood changed (it 
is reported that Deng also suffers from cancer of the blood), 
Deng will also increase his life force. 
  Nevertheless, it is certain that the opportunities for Deng 
to take personal care of state affairs will decrease 
considerably. The Deng Xiaoping Office led by Deng Rong and 
several persons trusted by the office have in fact taken over a 
lot of Deng's workload. 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin Steps Up His Efforts To Draw the Military Over </H5>
to His Side 
  In Deng's few remaining years, his health will certainly 
affect the several inner-party factions' struggle to consolidate 
their positions. In fact people in Chinese political circles 
are aware that the big shots in the CPC hierarchy have defined 
their focal points of work to expand their influence over the 
last six months. This tendency has become more evident recently. 
  Jiang Zemin placed his stress on the military. He was 
clearly aware that he must obtain the support of the military 
before he could have the situation well in hand and that he 
badly needed such support at present. Therefore, he made 
arrangements several years ago and obtained the gratitude of Liu 
Huaqing and Zhang Zhen by, together with Liu, squeezing out Yang 
Baibing and his followers. A military officer must perform 
military exploits before he can have a secure position in the 
military, but how can he perform military exploits in times of 
peace? Under the circumstances, Jiang considered it military 
exploits to obtain economic interests, or interests in the form 
of promotion [wei jun fang qu de sheng qian li yi 3634 6511 2455 
0648 1779 0581 6692 0448 4135], for the military. Hence, after 
helping Liu displace Yang and his followers, he paid close 
attention to personnel arrangements in the military. According 
to a reliable source, Jiang examined any promotion of officers 
at division level and above and interviewed those officers of 
army level and above recommended for promotion. 
  During the second session of the eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] held last March, Jiang frequently attended the 
group discussions of the People's Liberation Army delegation to 
listen to their demands. He supported the argument that the 
state must increase military expenditure by a big margin mainly 
for the purpose of improving servicemen's living conditions (the 
relevant proposals were adopted by the last NPC meeting). When 
other delegations which had demanded that he attend their group 
meetings made veiled criticism of his refusal to do so, Jiang 
put on airs, saying "whoever has opinions can express them to me 
directly." 
  It is safe to say that Jiang has recently reshuffled the 
military leadership to a certain extent. Though he is still 
unable to get absolute support from the military (partly because 
those who were sacked remain unconvinced of his leadership and 
partly because he has made fairly few contributions), he is 
still supported by those military officers in power (including 
Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and the retired Zhang Aiping), and 
again his move did not cause serious concern to Deng. That is 
how Jiang has pursued his line by enlisting support from the 
military. 
<H5>  Qiao Shi Expands the NPC's Authority </H5>
  Qiao Shi has also worked actively in his own interests. He 
has devoted his energy to the NPC and to procuratorial, 
judicial, and public security organizations, which had been 
under his leadership for many years. Since he was appointed NPC 
chairman, he has proposed improving the NPC's operation at every 
meeting. To this end, he recently tabled four specific measures: 
  1. Gradually grant legislative power to local people's 
congresses. Local people's congresses should be allowed to 
enact laws which have not been enacted by the central government 
when they consider it necessary to do so on condition that they 
do not go against the principles laid down by the central 
government. The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has set 
such a precedent. 
  2. Change the present legislative procedures. Many laws and 
regulations are now first drafted by government departments and 
then submitted to the NPC for examination and approval. This 
practice concentrates the concrete contents and actions of the 
administration of justice in the hands of the government system. 
There is no supervision to speak of in this regard. The 
government departments will legislate according to their own 
needs. In Qiao's view, the people's congress should be 
responsible for future legislation, and civilian experts can be 
invited to draft certain laws, subject to the NPC's examination 
and approval. The drafting of the "Securities Law" under the 
leadership of Li Yining has provided such a precedent. 
  3. Change the practice of "enforcing regulations on a trial 
basis before passing them into law" into the practice of "making 
laws before enforcing them." The past practice is equivalent to 
"groping our way across the river by feeling the stones on the 
bottom." If regulations are not passed into law beforehand, the 
regulations will be distorted or have their nature changed in 
accordance with the government's actual needs. Therefore, Qiao 
is trying to consolidate the NPC's authority. 
  4. Train law-enforcement personnel. In the past, there were 
no laws to go by in China, but at present there are difficulties 
in enforcing laws, or the law is not strictly enforced. This 
has everything to do with the quality of law-enforcement 
personnel. Therefore, Qiao stressed the need to intensify 
training for law-enforcement personnel. 
<H5>  Ding Guangen Stops the NPC From Publishing a Newspaper </H5>
  Apart from the four measures, Qiao has also constantly tried 
to reinforce the NPC's position. Earlier, a number of scholars 
and staff members of the NPC proposed setting up an organization 
to study the people's congress system. This was subject to the 
approval of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department 
because it involved ideology. But unexpectedly, the department 
rejected the application. Consequently, Qiao was forced to 
concern himself with the matter. 
  Again, the NPC so far has no newspaper of its own (the party 
has RENMIN RIBAO as its mouthpiece; the central government 
JINGJI RIBAO; and the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference RENMIN ZHENGXIE BAO). Earlier, some people suggested 
making FAZHI RIBAO an affiliated organ of the NPC. But the 
Justice Ministry, which owns the newspaper, declined the 
suggestion, because the newspaper has been bringing in a 
handsome profit to the ministry. Therefore, the NPC Standing 
Committee pressed for publishing a newspaper, temporarily called 
RENMIN ZHI SHENG BAO [PEOPLE'S VOICE], as its mouthpiece. This 
had to be approved by the CPC Central Committee Propaganda 
Department, but the application was turned down by Ding Guangen, 
head of the propaganda department. Only after Qiao called Ding 
directly was the application approved. It is still unknown when 
the newspaper will come off the presses. Wang Xiaoyun, a NPC 
staff member, is planning the work. All this indicates the 
effort Qiao has made to intensify the NPC's position. 
  What were Qiao's intentions in doing all this? Consolidating 
his own position or really reforming the NPC? His present 
efforts will actually serve to strengthen the NPC's functions. 
But how to prevent the NPC from degenerating into a tool of 
power struggles remains a matter warranting attention. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji Dismisses Sun Weiben From His Post </H5>
  Zhu Rongji has shown little ambition in his work (as he is 
appraised by his subordinates as well as subordinates of other 
senior officials). As he is mainly responsible for economic 
matters and is decisive in handling matters--it was Zhu Rongji 
who decided to remove Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang 
Provincial CPC Committee, from office and Jiang Zemin had no 
objection to his decision--he will be able to strengthen his 
position and I will say no more about him. 
  Li Peng has received little attention from the CPC 
hierarchy. 
He is now responsible only for foreign affairs (he is also 
responsible for Hong Kong affairs, so a fairly hard-line policy 
is being pursued. He is Zhou Nan's strongest boss). The view 
shared by members of the CPC hierarchy is that if Li Peng does 
not disappear from the political arena after Deng's death, he 
will step down like Hua Guofeng with the change in the situation. 
  No matter what will happen to the present pattern of power 
in 
the future, the present reality is that all factions are trying 
to reinforce their positions while Deng is still alive and that 
they are reluctant to see any destabilizing factors affecting 
their time and opportunity for reinforcing their strength. The 
poorer Deng's health and the less he concerns himself with state 
affairs, the more opportunities there will be for them. 
Therefore, the CPC hierarchy has almost reached a consensus in 
employing hardball tactics to maintain political stability.

<F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Feng Yingbing (7458 3841 0393): "The </F>
Positive and Negative Sides of Cultural Market Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 May (XINHUA) -- People have begun to 
pay closer attention to China's cultural market, which has 
experienced great development propelled by the great tide of 
reform and opening up. 
  Strictly speaking, the expression cultural market can be 
defined in a broad as well as a narrow sense. In a broad sense, 
cultural market refers to the performing arts, cinema, painting, 
audio-visual products, entertainment, books, newspapers, and 
magazines. In a narrow sense, cultural market mainly refers to 
books, newspapers, magazines, audio-visual products, and 
entertainment. At present, the narrow-sense cultural market has 
been the subject of discussions by an increasing number of 
people because of the existence of many salient problems related 
to books and other publications, audio-visual products, and 
entertainment. 
  China's cultural market has enjoyed rapid and full-bloom 
development over the last decade. The cultural market as a 
whole is brisk, orderly, healthy, and thriving. An expert in 
the area of culture summed up the Chinese cultural market at 
present in the following manner. He said a brisk, orderly, 
healthy, and thriving cultural market broadens investment 
opportunities. A pattern marked by state, collective, 
individual, and foreign investment has begun to take shape in 
China. A consumption structure that is rich and varied in form 
and conditions not only greatly enriches urban and rural 
citizens' cultural lives, satisfies the masses' different 
cultural tastes and demands, but also promotes the further 
development of cultural undertakings. In conclusion, he said a 
booming cultural market helps culture to play its aesthetic, 
educational, and cognitive functions, as well as create a very 
flexible environment for economic construction. 
  However, one should also see to the serious loss of balance 
that is plaguing the cultural market. The loss of balance can 
be seen in the following areas. The regional imbalance involves 
a large gap which is developing between economically-developed 
and undeveloped regions and between urban and rural areas. The 
lack of balance in overall arrangements involves performance 
market shortages and oversupply on the entertainment market. 
The lack of balance in the quality of performance is 
characterized by a reversal of the pyramid of first, second, and 
third-rate performances and by a situation wherein entertainment 
spots for the general public have turned into the preserve of a 
few. The loss of balance in cultural content is characterized 
by the predominance of outside over indigenous culture. 
Although the aforementioned phenomena are still developing, we 
need to pay close attention to them and correct them through 
working out quick macro-control measures. 
  Particularly worth pointing out is the negative side of the 
cultural market. People in some localities are engaged in the 
illegal production and marketing of pornographic books, 
newspapers, magazines, audio-visual products, of providing sex 
services on the entertainment market, and of using video-game 
machines for gambling purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to 
adopt a more forceful and effective measure to thoroughly 
cleanse these negative phenomena from the cultural market. 
  Of course, it is not right to close the windows just because 
a few flies have flown into the room. The proper thing to do is 
to install screens on the windows to prevent the flies from 
coming into the room and to build a tight management network. 
Relevant departments have done a lot of work in this regard and 
they are now working toward the goal of establishing a rational 
cultural structure and of improving cultural laws and 
regulations. As the adoption of the abovementioned measures are 
far from enough, we need to adopt further measures to plug all 
the loopholes. What is needed most now is to energetically and 
strictly enforce the law and to deal with the "flies" without 
mercy. While going all out to "cleanse" the cultural market, we 
should also devote great efforts to promote the culture, to help 
create conditions for great works that eulogize the main trend 
of the times, as well as to use creative works that are popular 
with the masses to throw away dirty mud, to cleanse muddied 
water, and to occupy the high ground of the cultural market.

0088): "Beijing Orders Nipping Unrest in the Bud; Senior Cadres' 
Children in the United States Told Not To Return Home for Time 
Being"] 
  [Text] The atmosphere in Beijing remains tense two days 
ahead of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident. In a 
document distributed throughout the country a few days ago, the 
top CPC level said that all kinds of measures will be adopted to 
maintain the stability of the situation and "to nip unrest in 
the bud." Armed police and anti-riot forces nationwide, as well 
as mechanized troops in the military regions, have been on level 
one alert since the middle of May. 
  According to a source in Beijing, although there is nothing 
out of the ordinary among Beijing residents, many insiders are 
worried about the externally relaxed but internally tense 
atmosphere. A reliable source disclosed that a number of 
children of senior CPC officials studying in the United States 
had originally planned to return to Beijing by the end of May 
and early June to meet relatives or do business. However, they 
recently received calls from home urging them to postpone their 
trips. 
  As Chinese-American Larry Wu has entered the mainland on 
numerous occasions with false identity papers, shooting 
documentaries which slandered the authorities, it is said that 
the Ministry of Public Security, Immigration Management Bureau, 
Armed Police Headquarters, and Ministry of State Security 
jointly sent a message a few days ago to all border posts urging 
them to keep a close watch over foreigners, Chinese students 
returning from abroad, and, in particular, foreigners of Chinese 
origin on the eve of 4 June. 
  In a document for internal circulation distributed 
throughout 
the country, the source disclosed that the top CPC level had 
stressed that stability is the overriding task at present. 
Party committees and governments at all levels must try by 
every means to adopt all sorts of measures to maintain social 
stability. It is a Chinese tradition to mark 5th and 10th 
anniversaries of events, the document pointed out. As the fifth 
anniversary of the 1989 Beijing political disturbance (referring 
to the 4 June incident) falls this year, hostile forces at home 
and abroad have threatened to launch a series of sabotage 
activities. Therefore, all localities should take precautions 
on the eve of 4 June and "nip all sorts of unrest in the bud." 
The document said that the central authorities are ready for 
any eventuality and have taken precautions. It is said that 
public security, armed police, and special anti-riot forces 
nationwide, even mechanized troops in the military regions, have 
been on level one alert since the middle of May. 
  The general office of the CPC Central Committee and State 
Council notified departments at all levels a few days ago, 
asking central, provincial, and ministerial leaders who are on 
inspection tours to return to their posts before early June, 
personally be on duty, and to be prepared at all times for any 
contingency. 
  The externally relaxed but internally tense precautions 
adopted by the authorities have exerted great pressure on 
government officials and intellectuals. Outspoken intellectuals 
and dissidents in Beijing have been very careful while receiving 
telephone interviews from abroad. They almost spoke in unison: 
"I dare not say that. It is not convenient to say that." A 
pro-democracy activist living in the home of a friend explained: 
"They are afraid of getting other people involved." Another 
writer, who ended his life in exile and returned home not long 
ago, cried out in alarm: "How can they make phone calls at such 
a moment!"

<F P=106> [By Lu Yu-shan (4151 6276 2619): "An Increase of 130,000 </F>
Personnel in Public Security Organs, Procuratorial Organs, and 
Courts--CPC Is Getting Tough Mostly for Stability] 
  [Text] Judging from what Chinese officials have recently 
done abroad and at home, people have the feeling that the higher 
echelons of the Chinese leadership are adopting a policy of 
tightening up, and the get-tough mentality has raised its head 
once again. 
  Although every event has its own specific backdrop and the 
causes for it cannot be lumped together, just as an insider 
said: Apart from their specific backdrops, these tightening-up 
phenomena are inseparable from the macroclimate of China's 
current political environment. Historical experiences have 
proven that tightening up of the overall climate is enough to 
make things that could have been handled in a relaxed manner 
rigid. How the higher echelons of the CPC leadership judge 
changes in the situation is an important factor in whether the 
macroclimate is tightened up or relaxed. 
  So, what made the higher echelons of the CPC leadership 
think 
that the recent situation was worsening and regard it as 
necessary to tighten up? According to the insider's analysis, a 
single factor was not enough to worry the higher echelons of the 
CPC leadership. What made them nervous was the multiplying of 
factors they deemed anything but reassuring and the simultaneous 
existence or worsening of those factors. It is revealed that 
the factors include the following: 
<H5>  Intellectuals' Free Discussion Becomes a Focus of Attention </H5>
  1. The political factor: 
  --Deng Xiaoping's health is a cause for the concern of all 
sides in society. 
  --The fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident is 
approaching. People attach special attention to every 
"five-year" or "10-year" date. It is learned that in February 
this year, a number of persons regarded as sensitive gathered in 
an open place near the Beijing Nationality Hotel, chatting about 
recent developments and current affairs. The authorities became 
nervous because they regarded the meeting, which was originally 
an idle-talk gathering, as being the same in nature as the 
"Beijing Hotel conference" in which the intellectuals rose in 
revolt in 1989. Moreover, word circulated from the authorities' 
inner circles that the information they had gathered revealed 
that some people were planning "some action" during the fifth 
anniversary of the 4 June incident. This made them feel more 
disturbed. 
  --As Deng Xiaoping's health is declining, all forces are 
racing against time to consolidate themselves. Therefore, they 
all need "stability" both internationally and domestically and 
thus agree to tighten up. 
  2. The economic factor. 
  3. The social factor: 
  --What most worries the CPC is that the workers' and 
peasants' sentiments are unsecured. There are indications that 
some workers' movements have been integrated with the 
intellectuals. Last year the government discovered for the 
first time that when studying the reasons for the failure of the 
pro-democracy movement of 1989, some people concluded that it 
"failed to integrate with the workers and peasants." This year, 
this momentum has become increasingly clear and underground 
trade unions have become more and more active, thus making the 
authorities become more nervous. 
  --The public security situation and corruption have 
drastically deteriorated, becoming a hidden crisis for social 
unrest. The most cohesive and appealing call during the 
pro-democracy movement of 1989 was to "struggle against 
corruption." Recently, the higher echelons of the CPC 
leadership have been studying four or five corruption cases of 
cadres at the vice-ministerial level, one of which involved a 
vice minister of power industry. When announcing such cases, 
the CPC confined itself just to the case of Li Xiaoshi, vice 
minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, and 
kept the others secret. 
  The Chinese authorities have set up an "Anticorruption 
Bureau" under the procuratorate with additional manpower and 
necessary facilities to replace the former "Economic Supervision 
Department." Nevertheless, in the last six months, the higher 
echelons of the CPC leadership unexpectedly discovered that the 
procuratorates and the courts also "competed with each other for 
business." The procuratorates held up and reached conclusions 
on 40 percent of the cases which ought to be handled by the 
courts, because they could proportionately retain "case-handling 
fees" by so doing and the litigants had to pay "business-trip 
allowances." In this way, the impartiality of the law is bound 
to be reduced significantly and popular discontent can be found 
almost everywhere. 
  --Social unrest generated by a fall in the standard of 
living 
is a time bomb which the CPC carefully guards against. 
  An Additional 130,000 Personnel Are Employed To Carry 
Out the "Severe Crackdown" Drive 
  The insider stated that the abovementioned factors played a 
certain role in the efforts of the CPC to tighten up recently. 
Political and economic factors are, more often than not, a 
latent crisis, while social factors are an "igniter." This 
being the case, the CPC will not make any concessions on 
political and human rights issues. Otherwise, domestic and 
overseas forces will form a united front against it. It has to 
adopt a "severe crackdown" stand on the public security issue. 
(Of the serious cases which constituted 25 percent of the 
national total in the first quarter of this year, quite a lot 
were cases "cracked" by the authorities so as to reduce others 
to submission.) If no "severe crackdown" is carried out, there 
will be instability in the grass-roots units. On the issue of 
integration of the workers movement and the pro-democracy 
movement, tremendous forces should be employed against it even 
more. Otherwise, the ruling foundations will be shaken. 
  Therefore, in February this year, the higher echelons of the 
CPC leadership dispatched personnel to conduct a social 
investigation to discover the possibility and degree of "popular 
disorder." Later, they conducted similar investigations on a 
greater scale in March in northeast China, northwest China, 
Hunan and Hubei, and Shanghai, with a view to conducting such 
activities in selected localities with different setups. The 
investigation results showed: "Destabilizing factors are 
numerous." 
  Then they urgently worked on countermeasures. At the meeting 
of the Political Bureau in early March, they unanimously agreed 
"to try every possible means to keep the situation stable and 
under control." Things that could have been handled in a 
relaxed manner should now be handled carefully and tight 
restrictions should be imposed if necessary. The higher 
echelons of the CPC leadership have thus decided to provide an 
additional 130,000 personnel to local public security organs, 
procuratorial organs, and courts so as to strengthen their work. 
(When launching the "severe crackdown" drive in 1984, the 
public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts 
received a boost of 200,000 personnel. The current one is the 
second-largest one-time boost in personnel ever seen.) Zhu 
Rongji ordered the allocation of 500 million yuan as a relief 
fund for "those in exceptionally great difficulties." On 5 
April (the commemoration day for the Tiananmen incident), Jiang 
Zemin called together military leaders in Beijing and urged them 
to make preparations to avoid popular disorder. He said: 
"Public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts have 
coordinated their activities."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other 
judicial-related activities in the PRC monitored by Hong Kong 
Bureau during the period 17-31 May. The source and mode of 
processing are given in parentheses at the end of each entry. 
Certain reports deemed more significant may have been filed 
separately, in which case the summary will include the serial 
number of the separately filed item. 
  As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month 
PRC crime reportage focused on no single issue.

<H5>  Dangerous Railway Travel in Mainland China </H5>
  After the Qiandao Hu tragedy, the Tourism Bureau of the 
Transportation Ministry of Taiwan announced a safety grading of 
mainland tourist spots, listing 11 tourist spots as high risks. 
In fact, tourists may be facing dangers everywhere in the 
Chinese mainland now. 
  The public security department of China's railway authority 
revealed that 15 railway lines were regarded as dangerous. 
These railway lines included the Chengdu-Kunming line, the 
Guangzhou-Chengdu line, the Guiyang-Kunming line, and the 
Lanzhou-Urumqi line. In 1993, 3,200 robbery cases occurred on 
railway lines, causing more than 260 million yuan in losses. 
Security authorities arrested more than 2,300 railway robbers 
and executed more than 370 such criminals. In the first three 
months of this year, robbery cases increased by 7 percent over 
the same period of last year. (Summary) (Hong Kong CHENG MING

<H5>  Sale of Fake Jeeps Rampant in China </H5>
  The legal affairs office of Beijing Jeep Corporation Limited 
[BJC] disclosed that assembling and selling counterfeit BJC 
Brand jeeps is quite rampant. So far more than 2,000 fakes have 
been discovered, but the actual number is much higher than this. 
Counterfeit Jeeps have been found in 29 provinces and autonomous 
regions throughout China. More than 600 counterfeit jeeps were 
discovered in Hubei in 1992; some 200 others were found in 
Yunnan in 1993; and more than 100 were unearthed in Xinjiang. 
Tax evasion through the sales of counterfeit Jeeps has caused a 
revenue loss of tens of millions of yuan to the state each year.

<H5>  Nationwide Tax Inspection Turns Up Evasion Cases </H5>
  Special nationwide tax inspections on 8,090,000 tax-paying 
individual business households by the State General 
Administration of Taxation in 1993 yielded 1.435 billion yuan in 
deferred tax payments, fines, levies on tax default, and so on; 
834 tax offenses were referred to judicial authorities, 422 of 
which were concluded, including 51 people getting court 
sentences. Self-inspections were allowed for 7,560,000 
individual business households, and tax authorities concentrated 
on another 3,330,000. [figures as published] The inspections 
identified two problems: Private firms trying to evade taxes by 
claiming to be collective units; and the doctoring accounts by 
issuing unsubstantiated invoices. (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in

<H5>  New Laws for `Unhealthy Practices' in Entertainment Venues </H5>
  Municipal authorities are drafting new regulations to 
control 
the practice of bar hostesses "keeping customers company." Over 
1,000 such establishments staged more than 90,000 entertainment 
nights for some 6 million customers last year. In some cases 
sex services were offered, and a harsh crackdown on such 
activities has failed to correct the trend. 
  The new regulations are aimed at strengthening comprehensive 
administration of entertainment venues and at curbing unhealthy 
trends. They clearly state that all such venues must apply for 
business and safety permits and business licenses. No keeping 
company with customers by female attendants will be allowed. 
Pornographic and other unhealthy means will not be allowed to 
attract customers. Violations of the regulations may result in 
the loss of business permits or licenses, depending on the 
seriousness of the offenses. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN

<H5>  Authorities Deal With Rash of Crimes by Migrant Workers </H5>
  The Fujian police revealed that a large number of migrant 
workers from Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangxi rural areas have been 
stranded in the southeastern Fujian cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, 
and Zhangzhou since the spring of this year. Because of high 
rainfall in these cities, many construction projects have been 
halted, leaving many migrant workers with no work to do. To 
make a living, they have to steal, rob, and engage in 
pornography, causing serious problems to social order in these 
localities. In the Fuzhou and Xiamen railway stations, about 
700 migrant workers have been arrested for carrying out criminal 
activities. (Summary) (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 18 May

  Juvenile Crime Rate on Increase in Quanzhou 
  According to the public security organs in Quanzhou, the 
city's juvenile delinquency rate is rising sharply. In the 
first quarter of this year, the city's procuratorial organs at 
city and county levels arrested 490 juvenile delinquents, far 
surpassing the 209 arrested in the same period of last year. 
  According to information, influenced by the Hong Kong and 
Taiwan movies which depict martial arts and gun battles, some 
young people organize gangs and fight. The Licheng Public 
Security Bureau recently cracked a criminal gang which called 
itself "pocket knife society." The youngest member of gang was 
only nine years old, and the eldest was not over 18, but every 
one of them was armed with a small knife and had a mark on his 
arm, making it resemble a secret society. 
  A circular here holds that one of the causes leading to the 
rise of the juvenile delinquency rate is the failure of schools 
to pay attention to moral education, while parents are busy with 
money-making businesses and neglect mental cultivation of their 
children. Increasing the crackdown on such juvenile activities 
only tackles a symptom, whereas the way to tackle the root rests 
on a society cherishing care and education for children.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A total of 1,361 
AIDS-virus carriers have been discovered in 22 Chinese mainland 
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and 22 of the 
country's 40 full-blown AIDS patients have died, an official 
from the Ministry of Public Health said here today. 
  Some 1,106 cases of the total involved mainland residents 
and 
the other 255 were foreigners and foreign citizens of Chinese 
origin, said the official at a seminar here today on China's 
AIDS prevention. 
  Despite the fact that China is one of the regions in the 
world with a relatively low rate of AIDS-virus infection, the 
Chinese Government has paid close attention to the issue, Chen 
Minzhang, minister of public health, told the seminar. 
  He said that China has intensified its efforts to prevent 
and 
curb AIDS, citing that in recent years the country has done a 
great deal in monitoring, educating on and researching into the 
disease. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Government has fruitfully cooperated 
in this area with the United Nations Development Program and the 
World Health Organization, Chen said. 
  China will keep to the principle of "prevention first" in 
its 
endeavors to curb AIDS and will actively advocate coordination 
and cooperation among relevant departments, the minister noted. 
It will also encourage the participation of the whole nation in 
the struggle against AIDS. 
  He said China will launch a publicity campaign on preventing 
and curbing AIDS so as to make people more knowledgeable about 
AIDS, which in turn is expected to help them avoid unhealthy 
behavior and boost their capacity of self-protection. 
  Official sources said that China is to draft medium and 
long-term plans on the prevention of AIDS as well as to step up 
the legislation of necessary laws so as to standardize the work 
and ensure the full implementation of measures designed to curb 
AIDS.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The World Health 
Organization awarded the Chinese Association on Smoking and 
Health and the Health Bureau of Jishan County of Shanxi Province 
with WHO Tobacco or Health Medals here today. 
  Today is "World No-Tobacco Day", on which who annually 
awards 
individuals and units which have made contributions to smoking 
control. 
  The Chinese Association on Smoking and Health has made great 
efforts to institute smoking controls since it was established 
in 1990, said an official from the Ministry of Public Health. 
So far, 26 provincial associations on smoking and health and 
over 300 basic organizations for smoking control have been set 
up in the country. 
  The Health Bureau of Jishan County of Shanxi Province has 
made remarkable achievements in smoking behavior intervention 
among farmers. It is trying to transform local custom through 
health education and formulating the villagers' pledge which 
advocates the good habit of "not offering cigarettes to guests 
in public places and at social activities." As a result, the 
smoking rate has dropped by six percent in the pilot villages of 
Jishan. 
  Chen Minzhang, minister of public health, said at the awards 
ceremony that the Chinese Government has paid much attention to 
tobacco control and actively supported China's bid for the 10th 
World Conference on Tobacco or Health. 
  "I believe that success in our bid for the conference would 
lead to far-reaching influences upon tobacco control in China," 
said Chen.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- State Council 
Decision Concerning the Annulment of Some Administrative 
Regulations Promulgated Before the End of 1993. 
  The objective conditions in China have undergone tremendous 
changes since 1985, when the country undertook to 
comprehensively sort out the administrative regulations 
promulgated by or with the approval of the State Council 
(including its predecessor the Government Administration 
Council) before the end of 1984. To meet the needs of the new 
situation -- that is, reform, opening up to the outside world, 
and establishing a socialist market economy -- and in accordance 
with State Council requirements for sorting out the rules and 
regulations, the State Council ministries undertook again to 
comprehensively sort out the 286 administrative regulations 
(excluding the regulations governing foreign-related matters 
that were declared annulled by a 1988 State Council circular or 
had become invalid automatically but including administrative 
regulations promulgated in 1985), the 33 administration 
regulations that were left out the first time, and the 365 
administrative regulations by the State Council between 1986 and 
1993 -- 684 pieces in all. After the State Council Bureau of 
Legislative Affairs item-by-item examination of the sorted out 
regulations, the State Council has decided to announce the 
annulment of 21 items (including those that have become invalid 
automatically). Of them, 13 were annulled by corresponding new 
laws or replaced by new administrative regulations while the 
eight others have become invalid automatically because the 
intended objects of the regulations disappeared, the period of 
applicability has expired, or because the specific, legally 
binding provisions formulated in reference to a specific issue 
have become obsolete. Rulings that were made on the basis of 
these administrative regulations remain valid. 
  Moreover, 86 administrative regulations have been 
specifically declared annulled by laws and administrative 
regulations promulgated between 1986 and 1993. A catalog of the 
invalid regulations is also included here to help various 
regions and departments obtain an overall understanding of the 
condition of those invalid administrative regulations, thereby 
facilitating their work. 
  Annex I: A catalog of invalid administrative regulations 
promulgated before the end of 1993 that were annulled or have 
become invalid automatically (21 items). 
  Annex II: A catalog of administrative regulations that were 
specifically annulled by laws and administrative regulations 
promulgated between 1986 and 1993 (86 items).

(6328 3057)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- During an interview 
with XINHUA on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the 
promulgation of the "PRC Military Service Law," State Councillor 
and Defense Minister Chi Haotian stressed that implementing the 
military service law and building stronger defense and armed 
forces have a close bearing on the state's economic development 
and long-term peace and stability, and so it is a mission to be 
accomplished by all party members and people of all 
nationalities in the country jointly. 
  China's current military service law was adopted by the 
Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress on 31 May 
1984. The law replaced compulsory military service, prescribed 
in China's first military service law drawn up in the 
mid-1950's, with a military service system which merges 
compulsory and voluntary service and merges militia and reserve 
forces, with compulsory service remaining the mainstay. 
  Chi Haotian reviewed the successes which party committees, 
people's governments, enterprises, institutions, and social 
quarters have achieved during the last decade in implementing 
the military service law; in accomplishing assignments relevant 
to military service, militia, and reserve services; in taking 
special care of disabled servicemen and family members of 
martyrs and servicemen; and in building stronger national 
defense and armed forces under the leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission. Chi Haotian said: The period from now to the end 
of this century is crucial for the development of China's 
socialist cause. While continuing to implement the military 
service law, uphold the party's basic line without the least 
wavering, and concentrate our efforts on expediting our economic 
development under the new situation, we must continue to build 
stronger national defense and armed forces and make constant 
efforts to strengthen our defense to powerfully guarantee 
security for reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  Specifying what needs to be done in implementing the 
military 
service law, Chi Haotian stressed: To implement the military 
service law, we must exert great efforts in fostering patriotism 
and selfless dedication so as to create an environment in which 
the whole nation will care for and support national defense. He 
pointed out: Following the founding of New China, patriotism -- 
which is one traditional ethic of the Chinese nation -- was 
further manifested. Models such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Su Ning, 
and Xu Honggang have come to the fore in the people's armed 
forces; and many progressive personnel -- such as Rong Guanxiu 
and Zhao Chenni, who are known as the mothers of people's 
soldiers; and Zhuang Yinfang and Shao Linyuan, models of 
supporting the military -- have also emerged from among the 
people. The solidarity between the armed forces, the 
government, and the people has become even stronger, and many 
units have distinguished themselves in rendering mutual support 
and in embarking in material and spiritual construction. Their 
exemplary deeds have fully demonstrated the patriotic spirit and 
selfless dedication of Chinese people of all nationalities. Chi 
Haotian pointed out: This spirit and dedication are 
specifically the spiritual support with which our country and 
people survived despite repeated catastrophes and aggressions, 
and they are the powerful force motivating us, the Chinese 
people, to press forward to build a prosperious country. Now, 
under the new situation, we cannot build a strong ideological 
foundation for implementing the military service law or build 
stronger defense and armed forces unless we make great efforts 
to promote patriotism and the spirit of selfless dedication. 
  Chi Haotian pointed out: To implement the military 
service law, we must strive to study and use Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system and 
demonstrate the role of the military service law in safeguarding 
the construction of our defense and armed forces. Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system with Chinese 
characteristics is the theortical foundation for formulating the 
military service law, and it is also the guide for implementing 
the military service law. Thus, we must integrate the study of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system 
with the study of the military service law, extensively educate 
the people on the military service law, and propagate knowledge 
about the military service law until each and every citizen 
understands its basic points and understands that a stronger 
defense and stronger armed forces are an important part of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and that 
fulfulling military service and being concerned with and 
supporting national defense exemplify patriotism and selfless 
dedication. 
  In conclusion, Chi Haotian said: As always, party 
committees, people's governments, enterprises, institutions, and 
people in all social sectors must be concerned with defense, 
support defense, promote defense education with perseverance, 
strive to make the whole nation more defense-conscious, and 
strive to make a success of affairs relevant to military service 
and the militia and in taking special care of disabled 
servicemen as well as families of martyrs and servicemen. The 
vast number of young people should have a correct concept of 
life and values, consider it their responsibility to safeguard 
the motherland, voluntarily fulfil their military service, and 
dedicate themselves to defense. All officers and men of the 
People's Liberation Army and armed police forces should keep 
firmly in mind that their objective is to serve the people 
wholeheartedly. In accordance with the Central Military 
Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin's general requirement that the 
PLA must "be politically qualified and militarily toughened, 
have a good work style, observe strict discipline, and be strong 
in defending the country," we must intensify our efforts in 
building the PLA into modern, regular, and revolutionary armed 
forces which actively support the country's economic 
construction and powerfully ensure the security needed for 
reform, opening up, and economic development. The vast number 
of militiamen and reservists must take the lead in participating 
in socialist spiritual and material construction as prescribed 
in the military service law. They should become the new force 
to become affluent through hard work, the sentinel safeguarding 
public security, and the powerful reserve forces backing the 
people's armed forces.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China has slowed down 
its price hikes as various macro control and price readjustment 
measures have been taken, a senior Chinese official announced 
today. 
  Addressing a national conference on nationwide price 
inspection, Chen Jinhua, head of the state price inspection 
leading group and minister in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, said that China has taken a series of measures to 
intensify macro control and control inflation so as to safeguard 
social stability. 
  In line with the state decision, he said, some provinces 
have 
established grain risk foundations. Meanwhile, price tags are 
placed on all commodities sold in state- and collective-owned 
retail stores and some private and individual stalls. 
  According to official sources, 190,000 cases involving 400 
million yuan in illegal profits have been uncovered during the 
two months after March 10. Over 100,000 of these cases have 
been dealt with according to law with a total penalty of 88 
million yuan. 
  To further bring the pries under control, Chen urged the 
local officials to focus the national price inspection on the 
daily necessities and production materials such as grain, 
cotton, chemical fertilizer, steel and electricity for 
agricultural use as well as service charges.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (CNS) -- Minister of the State 
Planning Commission of China and also head of the group of the 
national price inspection, Mr. Chen Jinhua, made a speech at a 
national meeting on the price inspection opened today, saying 
that the drastic price rise in China had slowed down with the 
implementation of various kinds of macro-control and price 
control measures as well as launching of the price inspection in 
the whole country. [sentence as received] 
  Mr. Chen said that, through efforts in the past few months, 
authorities at various levels in China had increased their 
consciousness to control and administer prices under the 
condition of market-based economy, and both production and trade 
enterprises had now realized that they should accept price 
control conducted by the state and should not do whatever they 
wanted. The price situation had begun to change. 
  Mr. Chen said that achievement made in the course of price 
inspection was great, however, it should not be overestimated. 
  He analyzed that the reform and opening to the outside world 
had kept its momentum since this year. Various kinds of reform 
measures in fiscal and tax, financial, foreign trade and foreign 
currency as well as investment system had been functioning 
smoothly after they were put into practice, some functioned even 
better than expected. The national economy was gradually moving 
in the direction demanded by macro-control. However, there 
still existed some unfavorable factors in agricultural 
production at present, and inflation still maintained a high 
level. Therefore, to stabilize prices and to curb inflation 
remained a key task of macro-control. 
  Mr. Chen called for strengthening control in price rise of 
daily necessities and basic services which would seriously 
affect people's life and had aroused strong reaction from the 
society. They included grain, cotton, chemical fertilizer, 
rural electric power supply, steel products and process oil.

  [Text] Taiyuan, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Tian Jiyun, 
vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing 
Committee, said that Shanxi should make great efforts to 
stabilize its agricultural production and promote township 
enterprises and coal mining. 
  He made the remark in his May 28-31 tour of the province, 
which is one of China's most important energy bases, producing 
most of the country's coal. 
  Tian, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that 
Shanxi should put the same emphasis on stabilizing both coal 
mining and agricultural production. 
  The province has placed agriculture, infrastructure and 
basic 
industry as the key sectors for future development. Plans have 
been drawn up to develop coal mining, electricity, 
transportation, water conservancy and road construction. 
  A new airport and railway station are under construction in 
this provincial capital. 
  Tian also inspected Dazhai Village in Xiyang County, which 
used to be a national model for farming. Great changes have 
taken place in this village in recent years, as the villagers 
have set up a series of factories.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State Urges Stepping Up of Price </F>
Monitoring"] 
  [Text] The government intends to continue nationwide price 
monitoring to ensure stable living costs, a top economic 
official said yesterday. 
  Officials once more will target key commodities which have 
greater impact on the price level, and are closely related to 
people's daily lives . 
  Prices of daily necessities such as grain and cotton will 
receive top priority, State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua told 
the three-day national working conference on price inspection in 
Beijing. 
  The inspection will also cover such key items as chemical 
fertilizer, power supplies for rural users, steel, petroleum 
products and service charges. 
  Chen said that while the country takes measures to scale 
down 
investing in fixed assets and issuing currency, it should 
simultaneously implement policies designed to encourage grain 
and cotton harvests. 
  Meanwhile, reform of modern enterprises should be pursued to 
increase commodity supplies. 
  "These steps will help to create a favourable condition for 
curbing inflation," the minister said. 
  He also urged officials to speed up price legislation and 
draft price laws and other regulations to ban illegal 
monopolies, profiteering and cheating on commodity prices. 
  Chen urged that the last two months progress in nationwide 
price monitoring be consolidated. 
  Price inspectors have, during the two months from March 10 
to 
May 10, uncovered more than 190,000 cases of price violations, 
involving some 400 million yuan ($46 million) in illegal price 
charges. 
  The meeting was told that 100,000 of these cases have been 
handled by fining violators 88 million yuan ($10 million). 
  "The inspection drive helped the local government leaders as 
well as producers and retailers to realize that prices can not 
be raised arbitrarily." Chen told the meeting. 
  Monitoring also helped implement State price control rules, 
including a grain risk fund at both central and provincial 
levels, and requiring all shops to put price tags on all 
commodities . 
  According to a recent People's Daily report, Shanghai has, 
since last year, set aside 400 million yuan ($46 million) as 
cash reserves for storing such daily necessities as grain and 
edible oil. The action has effectively curbed the market prices 
of these basics in the city. 
  However, Chen warned that some local officials have not paid 
enough attention to price inspection and made little progress in 
curbing inflation in their area. 
  "In some places, greater effort is needed to deal with 
illegal price increases," the minister said. 
  The minister anticipated improvements, however, following an 
announcement that those who hinder price inspectors face severe 
punishment.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In order to 
strengthen control over market prices and to basically maintain 
stable market prices, recently, a person with the State Planning 
Commission's Department of Market Prices proposed five measures: 
  First, regarding commodities such as oil and grain which can 
affect the national economy and the people's livelihood, state 
control over their prices cannot be lifted and a set of 
regulatory and control measures should be drafted to maintain a 
balance between total supply and total demand to ensure stable 
prices. 
  Second, make efforts to grasp the "shopping basket" project. 
In the last two years, many localities have canceled subsidies 
for meat and vegetables. Earnest measures should be taken to 
establish protection zones for "shopping basket" projects in 
large and medium cities. 
  Third, comprehensively employ administrative, economic, and 
legal means, which should include setting price ceilings, 
setting minimum prices as protection, reporting price increases 
for the record, issuing permits for the collection of fees, 
controlling differences in rates, and establishing a market 
prices regulatory fund; building a wholesale market and futures 
market; clearing ways for the peasants to go to the cities to 
sell their produce directly; changing the system of how prices 
are notified; and strengthening price inspections to ensure a 
normal price order. 
  Fourth, promote enterprise reform and increase their ability 
to adapt to price reform. The adjustment of basic product 
prices has put great pressure on enterprises engaging in the 
chemical industry, light industry, and the textile industry, and 
these enterprises should improve their absorbing ability through 
reform. 
  Fifth, expedite price-related legislation, oppose excessive 
competition, refrain from transferring the powers of the pricing 
department, and maintain the stability of pricing institutions 
and contingents.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Fu Jian: "Planning </F>
Takes Different Path"] 
  [Text] The connotation of the word "planning" is changing 
its traditional meaning for Chinese economists. 
  The largest planning body, the State Planning Commission, 
actually redefined the role of planning and investment when it 
recently announced more reform measures. 
  "All that the market can manage should be left to be managed 
by the market," said Gui Shiyong, vice-minister of the 
commission. 
  Planning departments should restrict their activities to 
those that the market cannot do or has failed to do well, he 
added. 
  Between 1949 and 1992, the government favoured a centrally 
planned economy. Planners' tasks were gargantuan, controlling 
virtually every aspect of national life. 
  But this has made decentralization of planning and 
investment 
a task of similar magnitude. 
  Thankfully, the efforts have been successful, Vice-Minister 
Gui said. 
  After almost 15 years of reform, local governments and 
enterprises have more decision-making power and possess more 
self-supplied funds, financial revenue? foreign exchange, as 
well as rights for investment. 
  Directive plans on agricultural production were cancelled in 
1985. As for industrial production, goods fulfilling directive 
plans make up only 4.5 percent of total industrial output. 
Concerning retail sales, only 5 percent of goods in shops are 
tagged with imposed directive prices. 
  With less directives to keep them busy, planning groups have 
shifted their function to broad oversight of the economy. That 
means less administration but more economic policies and 
legislative methods. 
  However, the existing planning and investment system still 
fails to meet market requirements, said Gui. 
  Outlining the necessary scope, he highlighted the function 
of 
planning, the content of plans and new methods of implementing 
reform. There is a lack of co-ordination among various 
regulatory means such as taxes, pricing, interest and exchange 
rates, he said. 
  The public seldom participates in formulating plans, and 
planning law is rather weak. Administrative interference still 
hampers the decision-making process of enterprises. What's 
more, self-restraint has not been established in the investment 
system, said Gui. 
  Since State subsidies remain in many enterprises and 
projects 
to keep their operation alive, their individual investors are 
not actually responsible for them. 
  The main spur to decentralize came at the 14th National 
Congress of the Communist Party of China in October 1992 when 
the socialist market economy was conceived. That meant giving 
the market the natural power, while downgrading central planning 
to a regulatory and aid role. 
  The State Planning Commission's latest reform aims to 
replace 
most administrative controls with economic regulations. 
  For the few cases in which administrative methods and 
mandatory planning are actually needed, the methods should be 
improved in accordance with the requirements of the market 
economy. 
  Local authorities need to be fully involved in the planning 
on the premise of guaranteeing the unity and authority of the 
central government, said Gui. 
  Powers such as issuing currency, determining bench-mark 
interest rates, regulating exchange rates and adjusting major 
tax categories and tax rates should all be controlled by the 
central government. 
  Economic affairs like local economic development and market 
activities can be organized by local authorities. 
  Public participation in designing and implementing plans 
should be strengthened. This would be more open, scientific and 
effective, he said. 
  The commission has already worked out more reform measures 
for the investment system. 
  A new system will strengthen responsibility of enterprises 
as 
well as banks, according to Gui. 
  When a project is constructed, certain enterprises must be 
identified as being responsible for it--from drafting the 
process, raising funds, constructing or producing to repay bank 
loans and bonds, as well as monitoring the appreciation of the 
asset's value. 
  A similar responsibility system should also be established 
in 
banks. 
  For project approval, a registration system will gradually 
replace administrative examination and approval. 
  Competitive projects with high profit returns and 
sensitivity 
to market factors will be left to enterprises themselves, with 
both decision-making power and risk responsibility given to the 
management. 
  Enterprises will mainly raise funds from commercial banks, 
and the government will gradually withdraw their investments in 
these projects. 
  The government will prioritize infrastructure projects and 
foundation industries as well as public welfare, science, 
education, culture and public health. 
  Control on the total amount and structure of investment 
should be strengthened, Gui said. 
  The State Development Bank, one of major regulatory means, 
was established recently to play a positive role in directing 
and adjusting investment. This can be accomplished through its 
policy loans, together with other measures such as taxes, 
interest rates and prices. 
  A market system which involves advisory, design, 
construction, auditing, and supervision of projects needs to 
provide assistance for enterprises. Meanwhile, relative laws 
and regulations should be made to ensure orderly investment 
activities.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by staff reporter Li Chun (2621 2504)] </F>
  [Text] According to a mainland official, five state-owned 
enterprises in Tianjing and Chongqing have been selected as 
experimental units for enforcing the bankruptcy law this year; 
that will be a most decisive step in the reform of state-owned 
enterprises this year as well as the key measure which Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji is bent on taking to push the reform efforts. 
  Reform of state-owned enterprises is regarded as the key and 
bottleneck in wide-ranging reform because of their economic 
importance, and the close link to ideology. It will not be easy 
to push this reform, and it will even more difficult to realize 
it. 
  Faced with the various knotty issues in reform of 
state-owned 
enterprises, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji went down south to 
Chongqing, a strategic industrial city, and personally made 
investigation and arrangements during the spring festival this 
year. He is bent on taking another bold step in Chongqing by 
selecting some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises as 
experimental units for enforcing the bankruptcy law. 
  The state-owned enterprises selected are those with poor 
management for a long time, with unmarketable products, with 
assets failing to cover debts, and unable to be reorganized or 
transformed through other channels. Chongqing selected a paper 
mill as the first step. Should it be successful, another two 
enterprises will be selected for further experiment. 
  There is no obstacle to allowing those state-owned 
enterprises that can in no way continue operation to go bankrupt 
either in concept or legal principle, but it can be extremely 
difficult in implementation. Two years ago, Chongqing was the 
first on the mainland to allow a state-owned enterprise to go 
bankrupt. The bankrupt knitwear factory did not have many 
workers, but their problems have not been properly resolved as 
of today; the city government has taken up the burden itself. 
  According to the enterprise institutional reform plan set 
last year, state-owned enterprises with a total loss of 100 
million yuan per day should undergo comprehensive reform. While 
formulating a plan, experts and scholars offered many panaceas; 
however, taking ideology into consideration, the plan was ironed 
out and the final plan became smooth and slick. At that time, 
Zhu Rongji who was responsible for formulating the plan had to 
admit that that was the best they could do. 
  The key to the reform of state-owned enterprises is the flow 
and reorganization of property rights, so that enterprises may 
genuinely operate on their own and assume sole responsibilities 
for their profits and losses, while the government retreats from 
enterprise involvement. 
  It is very difficult to break the old framework of the 
existing structure to shape a new property ownership structure. 
It would take a long time to see the successes of 100 large and 
medium-sized enterprises selected as experimental units. Thus, 
Zhu Rongji decided to take a risk and boldly allow a number of 
state-owned enterprises to go bankrupt. Bankruptcy will shape 
into a terrorizing power and pressure enterprise circles, while 
promoting their renovation; on the other side of the coin, 
bankruptcy and reorganization will not involve the 
"deterioration" or "converting public into private ownership" of 
socialist enterprises, thus avoiding criticism from the orthodox 
school. 
  Favorable external conditions in pushing enterprise 
bankruptcy lies in, first, the non-government and state-owned 
economies have already been separated, and risks to state-owned 
enterprises in boldly conducting reform have been greatly 
reduced; second, the concept of the market economy has taken 
root in people's minds, with changes in employment concepts and 
matured external conditions able to absorb and digest bankrupt 
enterprises; and third, there seems to be no obstacles to the 
implementation of the bankruptcy law today. 
  The greatest risk of the bankruptcy of state-owned 
enterprises seems to be arrangements for workers. A complete 
and perfect social security system is absent in China mainland 
today. Should past government intervention be stopped in the 
absence of better ways, big problems would be ahead. That 
accounts for the principle of experimenting first before 
spreading the practice.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Railways Diversify To Absorb Extra </F>
Labour"] 
  [Text] Railway authorities have successfully absorbed 
surplus labourers by diversifying their business dealings. 
  Since 1986, nearly 220,000 workers--6.5 per cent of all 
staff--laid off as a result of the Railway Ministry's recent 
efficiency drive have been moved to new services such as tourism 
and catering. 
  Minister Han Zhubin termed the multi-industry wave as "an 
effective way" to improve the sector's efficiency and digest 
surplus workers from its 3.4 million employees. 
  "Unwieldy labour forces and low labour productivity leaves 
us 
far behind the world's advanced level", he said on Thursday, 
vowing to divert 600,000 more workers from rail transport by the 
turn of the century. 
  The ministry's diversification has created 330,000 jobs in 
travel agencies, commerce and trade, tourism, catering, 
advertising, construction and mining. 
  But the minister reiterated the ban on businesses run by any 
railway security, procurators, judicial bodies or railway 
functional department. 
  "This is to prevent power abuse, and let grass-roots rail 
departments focus energy on shipping and safety," he explained. 
  The minister also warned against illegal trade of freight 
cargo or train tickets under the disguise of diversified 
business. This has hurt the railways image over the past two 
years. 
  "We are tightening check-up and supervision over those 
engaged in transport agencies. Both their service items and 
charges must be rational and legal," he stressed. 
  A special agency has been set up to promote and oversee the 
sector's diversified operation. 
  "We want a fast development of diversified operation, but it 
shall be on a healthy and legal track," the minister said.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- Along with the gradual 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, the 
change from the old to the new system, while bringing along new 
development opportunities to Chinese enterprises at large, has 
also posed a new challenge to them, that is, how can they adapt 
themselves to the turbulent "ocean" of market economy? 
  Economists hold that while enterprises in the mid-1980's 
suffered from low economic efficiency largely as a result of the 
"lingering effects" of the planned economy, their "inability to 
adapt to markets" today has obviously intensified and become the 
major contradiction hampering the economic efficiency of 
enterprises in the process of shifting from a product to market 
economy. 
  The results of surveys can fully explain the problem. During 
the past two years, along with the progress in the economic 
structural reform in all fields and the implementation of the 
"regulations [on changing the operating mechanisms of 
enterprises]," and along with the strengthening of the 
regulatory role of markets, the primary factors affecting 
enterprises' economic efficiency have undergone conspicuous 
changes. According to a survey of 50 deficit-ridden enterprises 
in Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin in 1991, the policy, 
macro-economic, and enterprise operational factors accounted for 
19.4, 47.8, and 32.8 percent, respectively, of the causes for 
the losses. However, another survey, conducted two years later 
in 1993, of 2,586 enterprises operating in the red in eight 
provinces and municipalities -- including Shanghai, Shandong, 
and Jilin -- showed that the causes for losses by the policy and 
macroeconomic factors both dropped to around 9 percent, while 
the factor of enterprise operations rose to 81.7 percent as the 
cause. 
  The differences in the survey results explain that in 
raising 
economic efficiency, enterprises should give top priority to 
focusing attention on internal operation. As we know, the 
continuous deepening of reform has resulted in the gradually 
rationalized relations between the state and enterprises and has 
greatly improved the external environment for enterprise 
production and operation. To further improve economic 
efficiency, it is necessary for enterprises to focus reforms of 
the managerial system and operating mechanisms on rationalizing 
the relations between enterprises and their workers and among 
various internal departments, reinforcing the incentive 
mechanisms and improving the supervisory mechanisms of 
enterprises so as to adapt themselves to new market situations 
with new systems. 
  This year is crucial for an all-out effort at reform. Along 
with the implementation of numerous measures for establishing a 
market economy, enterprises may experience greater "inability to 
adapt to markets." The State Statistical Bureau, in analyzing 
this year's enterprise economic efficiency trend, has noted the 
coexistence of factors for both promoting and hampering 
enterprises' economic efficiency while efforts are made to 
advance comprehensive reform and to achieve breakthroughs in key 
areas this year. Judging from the unfavorable factor, as speed 
will remain the major factor affecting the economic efficiency 
trend, decrease in the economic growth will, to a certain 
degree, lead to a drop in economic efficiency. Judging from 
favorable factors, the strengthening of the intensity of reform 
in state enterprises, the accelerating of the banking reforms, 
and other reform measures will contribute to the overall 
improvement of enterprises' economic efficiency. 
  Enterprises' "inability to adapt to markets" is a normal 
phenomenon in economic reform. An enterprise which can seize 
the opportunity to promptly overcome the "inability to adapt to 
markets" will take the lead in the market and raise the economic 
efficiency to a new height. Conversely, one which continues to 
suffer from the lingering effects will be eliminated. This 
explains the coexistence of opportunities and challenges for 
Chinese enterprises in the new era.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This year, 
the Beijing authorities have adopted a series of macroeconomic 
regulation and control measures to inhibit inflation, and 
initial results have been scored as prices of all categories of 
capital goods have dropped across the board in the first quarter. 
  Information released by mainland China's Ministry of 
Internal 
Trade and Material Supply Information Center shows that the 
aggregate average price increase of all categories of capital 
goods in the first quarter of this year was 8.2 percent, a 
decrease of 30 percentage points in the rate of inflation 
compared with the 38.2 percent recorded in the same period last 
year. Prices continued to drop in April, and the inflation rate 
has decreased from 15.8 percent in January this year to 0.4 
percent now. 
  In January, prices of steel products used as building 
materials soared by a wide margin, since all sectors of the 
community were optimistic about the economic development trend, 
and the state on its part moderately increased the money supply 
and implemented some reformatory measures. Price hikes were 
later stopped and are tending toward stability, showing a slight 
drop as a result of the policy of macroeconomic regulation and 
control practiced by the state. From information released by 
the Material Supply Information Center, the average price of 
steel products stood at 3,580 yuan per metric ton across the 
country in March, a further decrease of 0.6 percent in addition 
to the 0.5 percent decrease recorded in February. As compared 
with the price level in the same period last year, the general 
price level of steel products decreased by 4.5 percent, with 
small section steel prices decreasing, in particular, by as much 
as 11.8 percent. The average price for a car is 173,000 yuan, a 
decrease of nearly 10,000 yuan compared with the highest price 
recorded earlier this year. Meanwhile, building materials 
prices keep decreasing, with the nationwide average price for 
cement standing at 369 yuan per metric ton in March, a decrease 
of 5.4 percent compared with the price earlier this year. The 
price of coal remains relative stable. 
  Experts predict that since the general price level of major 
capital goods, such as steel products, timber, and cement, 
remains basically stable, prices of all categories of capital 
goods will remain stable as well, probably showing a slight drop 
in the second quarter.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- A 60-day nationwide 
general inspection of the implementation of the Statistics Law 
began today. Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistical Bureau 
and head of the leading group for nationwide general inspection 
of the enforcement of the Statistics Law, explained: The 
inspection will focus on the industrial output value that has 
created relatively serious problems and attracted comparatively 
adverse reaction from various social circles, particularly 
statistical data on village and town enterprises output value, 
population, grain output and reserves, peasants' per-capita 
income, investment in infrastructural construction projects, and 
commodities price indices. 
  It is learned that with the State Council leaders' approval, 
the leading group for nationwide general inspection, which has 
been formed by relevant comrades in charge of the State 
Statistical Bureau, the Ministry of Supervision, and the State 
Council's Bureau of Legislative Affairs, has made comprehensive 
arrangements in this regard. Targets of the general inspection 
will include all investigative units which have been involved in 
organizing previous statistical surveys, as well as all units 
which have been obligated to provide statistical data and which 
have been surveyed previously. The general inspection mainly 
aims at inspecting and handling wrongdoings of recent years, 
particularly those which occurred since the beginning of 1993. 
They include the following: To attain certain political glory 
and economic benefits while discarding the state statistical 
laws and regulations, some individuals or small groups 
misstated, concealed, fabricated, or illegitimately changed 
their data when filling statistical reports; forced or 
instructed statistical organizations and personnel to falsify 
statistical data reports; retaliated against personnel who 
boldly upheld principles by reporting and exposing illegal 
statistical activities; and obstructed the investigation and 
handling of illegal statistical cases. 
  The leading group for nationwide general inspection urged: 
While carrying out the inspection, various localities and 
departments should earnestly and properly conduct 
self-examination. All investigative units and units which have 
been surveyed previously should self-consciously check existing 
problems that may have arisen when they enforced statistical 
laws and regulations within their own units. They should 
thoroughly mobilize the masses to report and expose illegal 
statistical activities within their own units, and produce, 
after conducting self-examination, reports that aim at seeking 
truth from facts. Meanwhile, to prevent self-examinations from 
being performed as a mere formality, we should thoroughly and 
properly conduct major random checks. Counties and cities must 
organize effective investigative teams and specify units for 
random checks based on a ratio of one to every 10 units. 
  The leading group for nationwide general inspection 
stressed: 
We should earnestly and properly handle various cases. We 
should uphold the general inspection's basic principle that we 
must handle all complaints; we must investigate all cases; we 
must penalize all violations of laws; we will be lenient in 
meting out penalty if violations are revealed through 
self-examination reports; we will mete out harsh penalty if 
violations are exposed by investigative teams; we will seek 
truth from facts; and we will investigate and handle cases 
according to law. We must strictly handle, according to law, 
major and important cases that are exposed by investigative 
teams during the general inspection, particularly, those units, 
including their personnel who are directly involved, that have 
engaged in illegal statistical activities which are serious and 
have a relatively grave impact.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Enterprises in Guangdong Lack 10 </F>
Billion Yuan, and the Central Authorities Plan To Pump an 
Additional Four Billion Yuan Into Them To Help Meet Urgent 
Needs"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 29 May (TA KUNG PAO)--Huang Ting, deputy 
director of the Guangdong Provincial Commission for Economic 
Restructuring, has maintained that Guangdong is in an 
unprecedentedly difficult situation with regard to reform in 
1994. 
  In a public lecture several days ago, Huang Ting said that 
the burdens on Guangdong's enterprises have not been lightened 
very much. Financial reform is not keeping pace with the needs 
of development, funds are lacking, and it is difficult to 
proceed with the development of the capital market. At present, 
Guangdong has to strictly implement the central authorities' 
macroeconomic policy by controlling currency issuance. On the 
other hand, however, enterprises are suffering an acute shortage 
of circulating funds which is estimated to total 10 billion yuan 
or more. This problem becomes much more serious when we 
consider that many enterprises in Guangdong have to pool their 
own funds, are running deficits, or cannot obtain loans. 
Moreover, since the new tax system was put into practice, some 
rights concerning tax revenue have been centralized, and some 
enterprises no longer enjoy such previous preferential policies 
as the delegation of rights to local authorities and tax 
reductions. Their losses have therefore increased from 20 
percent to 43 percent, and their profits have decreased by 37.8 
percent. According to a recent survey conducted by the 
provincial government, there are still more than four million 
people throughout the province who do not have enough food and 
clothing. Guangdong is facing a difficult challenge this year. 
  Huang Ting briefed his audience on the new measures 
Guangdong 
plans to adopt this year. In the area of monetary reform, the 
main focus will be on developing local financial institutions 
and vigorously preparing the establishment of overseas Chinese 
banks. The relevant report has already been submitted to the 
central authorities. Moreover, foreign financial institutions 
will be encouraged to enter Guangdong, and the entry of foreign 
insurance firms is even being considered. Enterprises with the 
necessary conditions are encouraged to issue B shares abroad. 
Moreover, every effort will be made to guarantee circulating 
funds for enterprises that have a ready market, produce good 
returns, and have good prospects. Huang Ting revealed that the 
central authorities have already fully considered Guangdong's 
special conditions and are prepared to pump an additional 4 
billion yuan or more into Guangdong. Therefore, beginning with 
the second quarter of this year, the circulating funds shortage 
facing Guangdong's enterprises will probably be alleviated. 
  On the subject of the fiscal system, Huang Ting maintained 
that, although Guangdong will have to come up with an additional 
20 billion yuan or more according to the new fiscal system, this 
will be conducive to the healthy development of enterprises in 
the long term. Moreover, the province continues to allow cities 
and counties to be responsible for their own finances, and 
enterprises' responsibility contracts can be extended for two 
years to help them get through this transitional period. Huang 
Ting said that this year Guangdong will not introduce new 
pricing measures to curb inflation. As for reform of the 
property rights system, attention will be paid to avoiding the 
indiscriminate transfer of share rights to foreign businesses.

<F P=106> [By reporter Luo Kangxiong (5012 1660 7160)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 27 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business Activities 
held a discussion meeting of some provinces and municipalities 
on the work of checking unhealthy tendencies from 24 to 27 May 
in Shanghai. Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the State 
Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business 
Activities, emphatically pointed out at the meeting: The work of 
checking unhealthy tendencies this year is a continuation and 
deepening of last year's work. Our tasks are heavier and even 
more difficult. If we fail to exert efforts to do solid work, 
we will make the mistake of only going through the motions. 
Leading cadres at all levels must clearly understand the 
situation of the work of checking unhealthy tendencies this 
year, resolutely overcome slack and tired dispositions, 
concentrate on major objectives, seriously "rectify three 
irregularities and stop some unhealthy tendencies," and make 
more interim achievements in this year's work of checking 
unhealthy tendencies. 
  Xu Qing emphatically pointed out: To sum up, the major tasks 
of this year's work of checking unhealthy tendencies are to 
"rectify three irregularities and stop some unhealthy 
tendencies." Namely, we should rectify any wanton collection of 
fees, any overseas sightseeing travel in disguised form at 
government expense, and the abuse of power by party and 
government organizations and their personnel to obtain money and 
goods from enterprises, and we should vehemently stop 
conspicuous unhealthy tendencies in various departments and 
trades. He elaborated more specifically: In rectifying wanton 
collection of fees this year, we should see to it that all 
officially abolished fees are no longer collected, especially at 
the grass-roots units. We should particularly pay attention to 
preventing people from collecting abolished fees under new 
names. In rectifying overseas sightseeing travel in disguised 
form at government expense, we should apply more effort to 
stopping irregularities and strictly enforcing discipline. At 
the same time, we should get at the root of the problem and 
strictly examine travel applications. If the problem happens in 
a department due to failure in strictly examining travel 
applications, the department head shall be to blame. In 
rectifying the abuse of power by party and government 
organizations and their personnel to obtain money and goods from 
enterprises, the leading cadres of party and government 
organizations should attach importance to the work, know the 
situation of their organizations, adopt a clear and definite 
policy, and be determined to deal with the problem. They must 
sternly deal with any problems discovered and seriously prevent 
problems from recurring in the future. To vehemently stop 
conspicuous unhealthy tendencies in various departments and 
trades is an important part of the work of checking unhealthy 
tendencies this year. All localities should set concrete goals 
in correcting major unhealthy tendencies in various departments, 
and organize more personnel to deal with the problem so as to 
achieve breakthroughs. 
  Xu Qing said: In order to accomplish this year's work of 
checking unhealthy tendencies, ordinary measures and methods are 
hardly effective. We must adopt new, tough measures. We must 
do solid and more effective work to attain our objectives so 
that we have desired results to report to the Central Committee 
and to the people. He said: While applying our main efforts to 
checking unhealthy tendencies and enforcing discipline, we 
should pay attention to exploring ways for bringing about both 
stopgap results and permanent results. We should deal with any 
loopholes and weak links discovered during the course of 
"rectifying three irregularities and stopping some unhealthy 
tendencies." We should rectify wrong attitudes and work styles, 
and improve the administrative work and relevant systems, laws, 
and regulations through the reform measures of our locality and 
department. 
  In conclusion, Xu Qing said: The promotion of work ethics 
meets our objective needs, and is the fundamental way to deepen 
the work of checking unhealthy tendencies. We should continue 
to promote work ethics on an experimental basis at selected 
units. The experiment should be conducted in conjunction with 
the work of checking unhealthy tendencies. More attention 
should be paid to education, standards of conduct, and 
motivating mechanisms. Coordinated efforts should be made to 
explore effective ways, boldly reform and blaze new trails, and 
popularize the successful experience of selected units in large 
areas. 
  Delegates from 15 provinces and municipalities, including 
Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu and Shandong, exchanged information 
and experience on "hot topics" and "difficulties" of the work of 
checking unhealthy tendencies during the meeting. They put 
forward many good ideas and suggestions.

<F P=106> [By Yu Nai: "Tax Reform Pays Dividends, Causes Trivial </F>
Inflation"] 
  [Text] Tax reform has paid dividends just five months 
after the new system was introduced. 
  The reformed tax laws have not spurred on inflation as some 
predicted. Instead, it successfully increased central finance. 
  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the new system has almost 
fortified government revenue while causing only a negligible 
blip in inflation. 
  He claimed that the reform has been generally successful. 
  Accompanied with changes in banking and at state 
enterprises, 
the tax reform aims at boosting dwindling state coffers and is 
believed to be one of the biggest and boldest steps in 1994 -- a 
crucial year for reform, leaders repeatedly say. 
  The focus is on re-distributing revenue between central and 
local authorities and between the government and enterprises. 
  Taking the place of the contract system, by which localities 
are only required to turn over a fixed amount of their revenue 
to central coffers, the new collecting method breaks payments 
into three parts: One to the central government, another to the 
local administration, and the rest shared by both. 
  The reform has put enterprises of different ownerships in 
the 
same tax bracket of 33 per cent, creating a fair environment for 
competition. 
  Meanwhile, the government cut the original 40 tax items in 
half and focused mainly on collecting value-added taxes. This 
turns out to be more scientific and easier to carry out . 
  However when the system first went into effect on January 1, 
experts worried that double-digit inflation was not providing 
the right climate for tax reform. Some feared it would fuel 
inflation. 
  Theoretically the reform will trigger cost-push inflation 
because some enterprises will transfer the increased tax payment 
onto consumers. 
  But economists may rest assured. 
  The price hikes inherited from the second half of last year 
can be traced to the above-target money supply, overheated 
fixed-assets investment, and the raise in grain prices. "The 
tax reform has not pulled up the inflation rates at a large 
margin," said Minister Liu, also director of the State 
Administration of Taxation (SAT). 
  Before the reform each ton of steel cost more than 4,000 
yuan 
($461.9). The price actually fell thereafter. 
  Plainly, it is still the relationship between demand and 
supply which sets prices. 
  And while city folk complain that vegetables are more 
expensive than a few months ago, they can't blame this on the 
tax reform. The rate on the retail sales of vegetables has 
remained unchanged. But some wholesalers and retailers are 
raising the prices of their goods and services at the excuse of 
the reform. 
  To check the malpractice, the central government has 
launched 
nationwide inspection tours and enhanced supervision on price 
management. 
  These measures have kept the reform on the right track. 
  According to the SAT, state tax revenue jumped 29.2 per cent 
in the first four months, compared with the same period last 
Year. Central finance revenue was 85 billion yuan ($981 million) 
more than expenditures. 
  Generally speaking, most enterprises feel a lighter tax 
burden. 
  In Fujian Province the new system cut 49 million yuan ($5.6 
million) in taxes from state industrial enterprises, according 
to the Economic Information Daily. 
  Foreign investors who find themselves paying the same amount 
of taxes as last year have dispelled any misgivings toward the 
reform. 
  But the new system also hits some firms hard. The Economic 
Information Daily says that waterworks and those using farm 
products as major raw materials in Fujian shoulder heavier taxes 
than before. It suggests that the government consider lightening 
the burden on these firms. 
  The SAT does, in fact, extend preferential measures to some 
enterprises. Welfare-oriented enterprises, school-run 
factories, and some commercial wholesalers are refunded part of 
their tax; the value-added tax rate for things like coal and 
farm products has dropped from 17 per cent to 13 per cent. 
  SAT says that some enterprises are crying about increased 
taxes because the new system has stopped loopholes that used to 
make tax-dodging possible. 
  At the same time, the central government is aware of some 
technical problems in the enforcement of new taxes. 
  According to the People's Daily, only 40 per cent of stores 
know how to correctly make out value-added tax receipts. Some 
people in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai even print and 
peddle fake receipts. 
  Also the paper criticized a few local authorities who don't 
understand the new tax system. Their misunderstanding will 
likely upset the new system, it said.

  [Text] Local governments in China may get flexibility in 
the implementation of taxation, including property gains tax, 
according to a state tax official. 
  "In the light of the direction of China's reform, we 
shouldn't rule out the possibility of locality governments being 
given some flexibility in the implementation of local taxes, 
such as deciding on tax rates and ways of collection," said 
State Tax Bureau general deputy commissioner Li Yonggui. 
  In the race for foreign investment, many municipal 
governments have proposed refunds on property gains tax for 
foreign investors, making the tax ineffective. The move has 
been publicly censured by Beijing. 
  "The property gains tax is an income to locality governments 
but its implementation rests with the central government. 
Locality governments are not empowered to add something to it 
or abandon it," said Mr Li. 
  He confirmed that details of the property gains tax would be 
released and implemented this year. 
  "Before working out the details, we'll consult locality 
governments, the authorities concerned and Hong Kong developers. 
We'll consider the interests, returns and risks of Hong Kong 
developers (in their mainland property projects). We'll also 
take inflation into account," he said.

  [Text] A monitoring committee will be set up in each of 
China's state-owned commercial banks which are presently 
specialised banks, according to a senior Chinese banking 
official. 
  Such a committee whose members will include representatives 
from the People's Bank of China and related government 
departments, will be delegated by the State Council to monitor 
and examine each bank's operational approach and its capital 
preservation and growth situation. It will also monitor, assess 
and record the performance of each bank's director, proposing 
performance rewards and penalties. 
  Ma Delun, the People's Bank's policy research department's 
deputy director, yesterday said branches of state-owned 
commercial banks would also see the establishment of such 
committees. A monitoring authority already exists in the State 
Development Bank -- one of the mainland's policy banks. 
  Under existing banking reform, China's four specialised 
banks 
are now in the process of transforming into commercial banks 
which, being new financial entities, calls for a new mode of 
regulation. 
  These banks will not be allowed to invest directly in 
non-financial enterprises with their investments in insurance 
trust services and securities also restricted to a proportion of 
available capital. Their branches are granted no investment 
rights. 
  Meanwhile, the People's Bank has adjusted the bank reserve 
requirement to three per cent as one of the measures to maintain 
currency stability. 
  Mr Ma said the banking system put currency stabilisation 
before economic development, with the former expected to affect 
the latter. Previously this approach was reversed. 
  He also said the implementation of financial reforms should 
be preceded by the establishment of a system of regulations, 
such as the present one. "In the past, some reforms were just 
about implementation and action was taken before (attention was 
paid to) other considerations...existing financial reform starts 
with the establishment of financial rules," he said. 
  Mr Ma conceded the insurance industry was still not well 
developed on the mainland. "People don't understand the concept 
of insurance very well. More publicity is needed to educate 
them that it is an investment apart from being a kind of 
protection," he said. 
  "Policy insurance and commercial insurance should be audited 
separately...for fair and orderly competition. 
  "The industry should be differentiated into life insurance 
and non-life insurance. We should develop national, locality 
and specialised insurance companies." 
  Reinsurance companies should be set up and a rural insurance 
industry should be developed, he said. 
  "We should expand the scope and autonomy of capital use for 
insurance enterprises, and duly raise insurance solvency margins 
to strengthen the industry's financial strength."

  [Text] The People's Bank of China will continue to 
intervene in the foreign-exchange markets to support the 
renminbi at current levels, a senior Chinese official said 
yesterday. "We believe that 8.7 renminbi to one US dollar is a 
reasonable rate under present circumstances," Hu Xiaolian, 
deputy director of the State Administration of Exchange Control 
Policy and Regulation Department, said. "And the People's Bank 
will, like central banks in other countries, stabilise the 
renminbi at what it believes to be the beneficial rate." Hu 
said that although the bank would look to keep the renminbi at 
8.7 to the dollar, this was not cast in iron. "The rate is not a 
fixed one," she said. "It will have to adjust to the economic 
situation in China and, more specifically, the austerity 
programme and the need to rein in inflation." 
  Hu said the conditions were not yet right for foreign banks 
to be allowed to undertake renminbi business. She did not put a 
timetable on the opening of the sector. Chinese officials are 
understood to be reluctant to allow foreign banks to compete 
with domestic banks until the main land banking system is put on 
a sound footing. China has just launched an ambitious reform 
programme aimed at turning its former state-owned banks into 
commercial banks. 
  Hu said the inter-bank foreign-exchange trading network 
would 
be expanded to 18 cities this year from 12, but there were no 
plans at present to expand it further. "Its further development 
will depend on demand," she said.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make Persistent Efforts To </F>
Accomplish Plan To Sell State Treasury Bonds"] 
  [Text] This year's work of issuing state treasury bonds is 
proceeding smoothly, the plan to issue two-year state treasury 
bonds has been accomplished ahead of schedule, and the process 
of issuing three-year state treasury bonds has come close to 70 
percent fulfillment. 
  The scale of issuing state treasury bonds this year is 
markedly larger than last year, while the period arranged for 
their issuance is markedly shorter than last year. In the past 
two months, with the support from the broad masses of the 
people, issuance of state treasury bonds made satisfactory 
progress, and many localities saw people competing to buy state 
treasury bonds. 
  The issuance of state treasury bonds is a good thing which 
benefits the country and the people, and the issuance of state 
treasury bonds this year is a big issue which has a bearing on 
reform, development, and overall stability. In particular, it 
is of great significance to strengthening macroregulation and 
control, checking inflation, and ensuring the construction of 
key projects. Apart from using market methods to strengthen 
sales, the relevant departments have also adopted many 
preferential policies and conditions toward the issuance of 
state treasury bonds to enable investors enjoy benefits; as a 
result, state treasury bonds have become an important means for 
the masses to preserve and increase the value of the money in 
their hands. Therefore, this year's issuance of state treasury 
bonds has won the enthusiastic support and response of various 
social quarters in the whole country. Judged from the issuance 
situation in the last two months, most buyers of state treasury 
bonds are individuals from the masses, and this shows that the 
real foundation of the national debt market rests on the broad 
masses of people. 
  Since this year, the national economy has continued to 
maintain a good development trend, various reforms have 
proceeded normally, and the financial and revenue situations are 
very good, and this has provided a relatively good macro 
environment for the work of issuing state treasury bonds. This 
year, governments of various levels have attached great 
importance to the work of issuing state treasury bonds, and they 
have organized efforts and exercised leadership effectively; the 
financial departments of various levels, banks, and relevant 
organs established the concept of the overall situation, 
coordinated efforts among themselves, and earnestly organized 
propaganda and provided many convenient services to the people 
as they promoted state treasury bonds; and propaganda 
departments gave active support by launching propaganda, and 
this was also an important factor contributing to our success. 
  At present, there are only a few days left to the deadline 
for the issuance of two-year state treasury bonds, and it is 
only one month to the deadline for the issuance of the 
three-year bonds. Relevant departments in various localities 
must make persistent efforts and continue to do solid work in 
sales and service. Although the plan to issue two-year state 
treasury bonds has been accomplished ahead of schedule, relevant 
departments in various localities must continue to meet the 
needs of units and the masses who want to buy state treasury 
bonds and continue to run the business of "using the old to 
change for the new." Because the work of issuing two-year bonds 
will soon end, purchasing power will change course to the 
three-year state treasury bonds, therefore, the relevant banks 
must still adopt effective measures and do a good job in 
propaganda and service to allow units and the masses to further 
understand the preferential conditions of the three-year bonds, 
as well as the function of buying state treasury bonds as a 
means to preserve and increase the value of their savings. 
Financial departments at various levels and securities agencies 
should create conditions for active participation in and 
assistance to the work of promoting the three-year state 
treasury bonds, and, through flexible and convenient sales 
service, meet the need of various social quarters who want to 
buy state treasury bonds. Through common efforts, this year's 
plan for the issuance of state treasury bonds will surely be 
accomplished on schedule.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Jian (0491 0256) of the Enterprise </F>
Supervisory Office of the Beijing Municipal Industrial and 
Commercial Bureau: "Tricks by Foreign Side in Joint Ventures To 
Transfer China's Domestic Capital"] 
  [Text] After business registration, some foreign investors 
in joint ventures resort to many tricks to devour China's 
domestic capital during the initial period of the joint 
venture's operations, the profit-making period, and the 
winding-up period by taking advantage of the incompleteness of 
some policies, loopholes in departmental convergence, a lack of 
information on the world market, and their eagerness to seek 
foreign capital. They mainly employ the following tricks: 
  They use deceptive methods to raise the price of equipment 
when submitting quotations. Under the pretext of "joint 
purchase and each having a share of the stock," they ask the 
Chinese side in the joint venture to remit foreign exchange to 
overseas bank accounts. Not knowing about their foul play, the 
Chinese side is cheated into remitting foreign exchange out of 
the country. 
  They use intangible assets for investment and raise prices 
by 
introducing a no-price reference system and taking advantage of 
the Chinese side's difficulty in carrying out accurate 
appraisals, thus holding the stock of the joint venture and 
sharing its profits. 
  By investing technology and equipment, they control the 
supply of materials needed for production and the right to 
purchase outside the country. They devour the Chinese side's 
foreign exchange outside the country by submitting high price 
quotations. Taking advantage of the Chinese side's eagerness 
for "more foreign exchange," they monopolize overseas sales 
channels and rights and cut off the link between Chinese 
enterprises and the international market. They lower the export 
price of commodities and raise the selling price of these 
commodities in foreign countries to make exorbitant profits 
abroad. 
  They establish enterprise "groups" with "key enterprises" 
(enterprises with 50 percent or more of the stock in the 
possession of the foreign side) as their core and turn other 
enterprises in these "groups" into processing factories of the 
"key enterprises," thus controlling domestic sales of products 
manufactured by other enterprises. These "key enterprises" 
purchase other enterprises' products at low prices and thus make 
exorbitant profits through domestic commercial channels. 
  Not long after investing, they withdraw their investment 
capital under false pretexts and allow production to continue 
with the Chinese side's capital or domestic bank loans. They 
participate in profit sharing by illegally obtaining 
qualifications. 
  By taking advantage of policy differences between regions, 
they transfer their income to other tax-rate regions (usually 
low-tax regions) by irregular financial means, thus creating a 
false loss-making situation. 
  They transfer cost expenses from an enterprise where they 
hold a high percentage of the stock to an enterprise where they 
hold a low percentage of the stocks or else they shelve the 
expenses to form a large "expense pending apportionment." In 
enterprises where they hold a low percentage of the stock, they 
shift the burden to the Chinese side. 
  They make one investment and then repeatedly spirit it away 
to form capital with multiple registration. In this way they 
get profits from various aspects by illegally obtaining 
qualifications. 
  They rent out or sell duty-free goods and equipment to 
others 
to receive exorbitant profits. 
  They illegally engage in business operations which are 
prohibited by the state. By deceptive means, they cheat a large 
amount of capital out the Chinese side and deposit it into their 
accounts to obtain interest. They mix this interest with their 
business profits and remit it out of the country. 
  When a joint-venture enterprise winds up due for certain 
reasons but has a surplus at liquidation, the foreign side will 
use diluted stock to participate in the distribution of the 
remaining assets. 
  These tricks can be summed up in four types: Submitting high 
price quotations, occupying diluted stocks, taking advantage of 
price differences, and false accounting. Each trick manifests 
itself in the different development periods of joint-venture 
enterprises. These tricks by law-breaking foreign investors 
have caused losses of state assets, as well as the results of 
introducing foreign capital. Effective measures must be taken 
to stop them.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Growth in State Firms Is Forecast"] </F>
  [Text] Casting aside wariness about their teetering 
profits, State-run industries are likely to expand production 
this year by 7 percent to 8 percent, the State Information 
Centre said. 
  In comparison, State industrial output last year grew by 6.4 
percent, said Xu Hongyuan, an economist with the centre's 
economic forecasting department. The State Information Centre 
is an arm of the State Planning Commission. 
  Hindered by some small and medium-sized money-losing 
factories, State industry only saw a limited production growth 
of 2.2 percent in March and 5 percent in April, Xu added. 
  However, he predicted that in the months to come large 
factories will lead State manufacturers to stepped-up 
production, aided by a slight loosening of the government's 
controls on credit. 
  "Their production growth may stand at around 7 percent in 
May 
and June," he noted. 
  The higher industrial production will help push up growth in 
the gross national product by 12 percent during the first six 
months, Xu said. 
  During the first half of this year, State factories are 
expected to turn over to the government 30 percent more in taxes 
than in the same period last year. 
  Xu believes that the big factories are propping up the 
entire 
State sector, which accounted for nearly half of the country's 
industrial output last year. Big factories make up one-fifth of 
all State industrial enterprises. 
  Official sources say that slow sales and outdated products 
are responsible for "quite a lot" of the operational losses of 
small and medium-sized firms. 
  Xu said that State enterprises turn over to the government 
as 
much in taxes as do foreign-funded firms, but that growth in 
their production and profits is much slower. This reflects 
slower improvements in efficiency in small and medium-sized 
State enterprises. 
  Heavy financial burdens are hobbling State industries trying 
to increase their profitability, Xu noted. 
  For example, he said, "A worker in a State-owned factory now 
has to support the pensions of at least two retirees." 
  Meanwhile, wage reform has raised workers' salaries by 28 
percent even as State factories struggle for profits and 
inventories pile up. 
  Economists with the State Information Centre suggest that 
State firms take bold steps to strengthen their internal 
management. For instance, they say that linking employee 
salaries to company profits would raise morale and improve 
productivity. 
  In addition, they believe that since the central government 
urges State factories to finance the pensions of many retirees, 
it should also consider slashing plants tax burdens. 
  Xu said the government should give most money-losing State 
factories a chance to recover, since they are struggling hard to 
cope with sweeping reforms in finance and taxation. 
  However, those State firms that stubbornly cling to 
discredited management methods and continue to lose money should 
be declared bankrupt or be merged with other factories.

<F P=106> [By reporter Shen Haixiong (1957 3189 7169) and </F>
correspondent Zhao Renchun (6392 0088 2504)] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 30 May (XINHUA) -- Some Zhejiang peasant 
entrepreneurs with strategic vision have worked to open up 
markets in the central and western parts of the country, and the 
Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee and government have taken 
measures to support local town and village enterprises in doing 
so. 
  Hangzhou's Wanxiang Group has decided to appropriate 100,000 
yuan for soliciting "westward-bound" strategic plans from across 
the country. According to the enterprise group's 
"westward-bound plan," it will invest 100 million yuan in 
developing markets in central and western China. Before this, 
hundreds of Zhejiang's town and village enterprises had already 
established enterprises in central and western China. Xiaoshan 
City's Hangmin Industrial Corporation, in the richest village in 
Zhejiang, has invested 20 million yuan in the last two years to 
establish a few textile dyeing factories in Henan's Zhengzhou 
and other localities. The corporation's president, Zhu 
Chongqing, said gaining a foothold in the central and western 
parts of the country had expanded his company's markets and 
added new assets to the company. 
  The sales of industrial products of Zhejiang's approximately 
700,000 town and village enterprises total 240 billion yuan 
annually, accounting for two thirds of the province's total 
industrial sales and 11 percent of the total sales of the 
country's town and village enterprises. The province also has 
more than 280 large enterprises, each of whose annual output 
value exceeds 100 million yuan and whose annual exports exceeds 
30 million yuan. 
  An official of the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Town and 
Village Enterprises said: Due to lack of energy and raw and 
processed materials in the province, local enterprises are 
unable to get necessary resources locally. Moreover, because 
the major products of local town and village enterprises are 
daily consumer products, inland markets have become increasingly 
important to us. According to a survey report, the petroleum, 
coal, steel products, cotton, and other important materials 
currently needed by Zhejiang's town and village enterprises' 
production are primarily supplied from the central and western 
parts of the country. And, at least more than 100 billion yuan 
of the province's annual sales of industrial products comes from 
central and western China. 
  Since the state called for promoting economic and 
technological cooperation and exchange in 1993 in an organized 
and planned manner between the eastern and western parts of the 
country, some farsighted town and village entrepreneurs of 
Zhejiang have begun to set their eyes on gaining a foothold in 
the central and western regions of the country, deciding to 
develop cooperation with these regions to seek common prosperity. 
  The Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee and government have 
fully approved such moves by local town and village enterprises, 
and quickly set up a leading group for coordinating cooperation 
between local town and village enterprises and regions west of 
the province, to ensure that local town and village enterprises 
gain a foothold in these regions. So far, the group has 
proposed to local town and village enterprises nearly 100 
cooperation projects with Xinjiang, Henan, and other localities. 
Cooperation on many of these projects has begun. 
  Zhejiang's town and village enterprises have entered the 
central and western regions using three major approaches: The 
first approach is by way of contracting or leasing, that is, 
Zhejiang's town and village enterprises contract or lease 
loss-making enterprises in central and western China and then 
use their more skillful management to improve these enterprises' 
economic performance. So far, at least more than 100 town and 
village entrepreneurs from Zhejiang have settled down in central 
and western China. After contracting to run a state-owned 
Chinese medicine factory in Shanxi's Taiyuan, a peasant 
entrepreneur from Zhejiang's Wenzhou boldly adopted new 
management mechanisms to run the factory, enabling the 
debt-ridden "long-established" enterprise to regain vitality 
before long. The second approach is by way of joint business 
operations, that is, Zhejiang's town and village enterprises, 
making use of their better technology and management expertise 
and the rich resources and lower wages in central and western 
regions, establish new enterprises in these regions and sell 
their products locally. The Shijia Sports Wear Company in 
Zhejiang's Cixi established a factory in this way in northern 
Anhui. The third approach is by way of establishing energy and 
raw and processed materials bases and sales outlets in central 
and western China. For instance, more than 20 town and village 
enterprises in Zhejiang's Huzhou have established energy bases 
in Shanxi -- a major energy-producing province -- and assisted 
local enterprises to improve storage, transportation, and 
processing equipment. Realizing that the country's western 
region borders some Central Asian nations, many town and village 
enterprises in Huzhou have jointly established trading companies 
with enterprises of the region, enabling them to use border port 
cities as their "jumping boards" for entering Central Asian and 
European markets. The Bosaidong Garment Company in Huzhou's 
Zhenxi Township was a little- known enterprise; but, since it 
set up a few "trade windows" in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang last 
year, its products have quickly entered East European countries, 
enabling the company's per capita tax payment and profit to 
reach 10,000 yuan last year. 
  Zhejiang's town and village entrepreneurs who have 
established enterprises in the central and western parts of the 
country said their opening up markets in central and western 
China was an economic move based on market demand and prompted 
by mutual economic benefits and that the purpose was to enable 
the eastern and western parts of the country to enjoy common 
prosperity through reaping common economic benefits.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Steel Prices Decline Due to Oversupply"] </F>
  [Text] Rolled steel prices have dropped on the Chinese 
market due to overproduction and a tight bank credit policy. 
  Since April, prices of most steel products declined by 1.5 
to 
4.1 percentage points around the country. It was the first time 
this year that steel prices fell. 
  The main reason for the price slide was that supply had 
already surpassed demand, said officials from the Ministry of 
Metallurgical Industry. 
  China's output of rolled steel reached 27 .6 million tons 
during the first four months of this year. That was up 9.81 per 
cent over the same period last year. 
  At the same time, imports of rolled steel amounted to 6.21 
million tons, an increase of 5 per cent over last year. 
  As a result, stockpiles swelled around the country. By the 
end of April, the stockpile of domestic steel had jumped 26.73 
per cent from the beginning of the year. 
  Officials said that the shortage of money under the central 
bank's tight credit policy to control investment and bring down 
rising inflation also contributed to slack domestic demand for 
steel products. 
  Many manufacturing and trading companies do not have enough 
money to buy steel products and other raw materials. 
  The government's investment control in fixed assets has 
curbed the demand for steel products, according to officials. 
  Steel prices rose sharply beginning early last year with the 
country's investment and construction boom. Imports, mainly 
from Japan, South Korea and Europe were large because Chinese 
manufacturers could not meet demand. China produced 76 million 
tons of rolled steel in 1993. 
  Prices started to drop after the central bank adopted a 
tight 
credit policy and limited real estate development last July. 
  Also, imports became more expensive with the devaluation of 
renminbi from 5.8 yuan to one U.S. dollar to the current 8.7. 
Despite that, imports are still large at the moment. Starting 
from this year, the import licence for steel products was lifted. 
  In December last year Chinese companies imported 4 million 
tons of rolled steel, which greatly expanded the country's 
stockpile. 
  Since this year, the government cancelled the import 
licenses 
for steel products. Domestic companies can now import steel 
through various channels. 
  However, due to lack of co-ordination and management, many 
companies still import those steel products that are already 
hard to sell on the domestic market, officials said. 
  To stem speculation on the domestic market, the government 
decided to stop futures trading in steel products in early April.

  [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- China's steel giant, the 
Capital Iron and Steel Works (Shougang), employs 207 foreign 
professionals from Russia, Ukraine, the U.S., Japan, Canada and 
Germany. 
  Some 85 percent of them are senior engineers or experts in 
metallurgy, mechanics, architecture, finance, management and 
environmental protection. 
  Shougang is a pioneer enterprise in China's economic 
restructuring. It has developed into a transnational 
conglomerate, with 260,000 employees. 
  It provides a good working and living environment for the 
experts. It has built special apartments for them, their 
spouses and children. Offices, research equipment, testing 
facilities and computers are all available for them. There is 
also a special entertainment center for them. 
  The foreign professionals have made great contributions to 
the development of Shougang. In 1993 foreign experts completed 
35 programs for the works, producing nearly 100 million yuan in 
earnings. 
  In order to raise its management level Shougang intends to 
hire prominent foreign entrepreneurs, financiers and bankers in 
the near future.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters Tian Huiming (3944 1920 2494) and Yu </F>
Donghui (0151 2639 2547)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- While many 
managers of state-owned enterprise are considering the issue of 
how to extricate themselves from the predicament of losses, Luo 
Bingsheng, general manager of the Shoudu Iron and Steel Company, 
is thinking about ways to expand the company's businesses in two 
directions -- extending its influence over Southeast Asia and 
gaining access to markets in Europe and the United States with 
the aid of Hong Kong's position as a financial and trade center 
and its advantages as a free port. 
  During an exclusive interview with these reporters a few 
days 
ago, Luo Bingsheng summarized the overseas development strategy 
of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation as a "two-step" plan. 
  Shougang Overseas Headquarters, which has a staff of 6,000 
people, has been established. General offices in Hong Kong and 
New York, which are subordinate to the headquarters, were set 
last year. Earlier this year, Shougang Southeast Asia Holdings 
Corporation was registered in Singapore. The company's overseas 
development strategy -- standing firm in Hong Kong, unfolding 
its two wings, opening up new battlefields, and building new 
bases -- has begun to take shape. 
  Luo Bingsheng said: In the course of reform and opening up, 
the gates of Shoudu Iron and Steel Company must not only open to 
the domestic market, but must open to the outside world as well. 
The company must march into the international market to compete 
with the largest corporations in the world. 
  Luo, an expert in iron and steel production who graduated 
from Guizhou Industrial College in the 1960's, has such ideas: 
"It is necessary to set up a concept of operating in debt and 
courageously borrowing money and utilizing foreign capital to 
develop ourselves." 
  In October 1992, the board of directors of Shoudu Iron and 
Steel Company made a decision within 24 hours to join hands with 
Hong Kong's tycoon Li Ka-Shing to take over Hong Kong's Tung 
Wing Steel Holdings Limited. Later, it consecutively gained 
control of four listed Hong Kong companies, comprising Eastern 
Century Holdings Limited, Santai Manufacturing Limited, Kader 
Holdings Company Limited, and Hoi Sing Holdings Limited. This 
series of actions shook the Hong Kong stock market. 
  According to Zhou Guanwu, chairman of the Shoudu Iron and 
Steel Company, the above actions were not giant strides but 
small ones for the company in marching into Hong Kong. 
  In the meantime, the company took a major step to acquire a 
steel works in California and a large iron mine in Peru, which 
evoked repercussions both at home and abroad. 
  Luo Bingsheng added, smiling: Our business in the United 
States is merely at a "stage of laying out chess pieces" and our 
goal for the next step is to enter the U.S. stock market. 
  Luo Bingsheng said: The overseas development strategy put 
into practice was the brainchild of Zhou Guanwu, the "chief 
architect" of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation. In every 
country, a number of backbone enterprises seek access to 
international markets. Similarly, Shoudu Iron and Steel 
Corporation is ready to enter international markets because it 
has grown in strength and possesses this capability as a result 
of 15 years' of reform. 
  According to Luo Bingsheng, a milestone of historic 
significance in the development of the Shoudu Iron and Steel 
Corporation was Deng Xiaoping's inspection on 22 May 1992 and 
his instructions on that occasion that the company should take 
the lead in the country's iron and steel industry. 
  Afterward, leading cadres of the State Council, including Li 
Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Zou Jiahua came to inspect Shoudu Iron and 
Steel one after another, and, centering around the development 
objective of building the company into a large transnational 
enterprise, decided to grant "three powers"--investment power, 
financing power, and decisionmaking power in foreign trade--to 
the company. 
  With these three powers, Shoudu Iron and Steel, like a tiger 
with wings, began to operate international businesses as it 
already had the important prerequisites for the exploration of 
overseas markets. 
  Looking forward to the company's future, Luo Bingsheng said: 
At the turn of the century, the output of the company's iron 
and steel production base in Beijing will reach 10 million 
tonnes a year, and that of the Qilu production base, which has 
yet to be built, will also reach 10 million tonnes a year. With 
the construction of an overseas iron and steel base with an 
annual output of 5 million tonnes to be completed, the Shoudu 
Iron and Steel Corporation will fully deserve the name of the 
largest iron and steel company in the world. 
  Why can China's large enterprises not operate on an equal 
footing with the big companies of the world? This is an issue 
the general manager of Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is 
always thinking about.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Oiling the Wheels"] </F>
  [Text] China will employ more flexible policies to open up 
new horizons for foreign investment in its oil industry. Wang 
Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), said 
co-operation with foreign governments and companies, unfurling 
offshore as well as onshore, will take more flexible forms. 
  In an interview with Business Weekly, Wang said a wide range 
of joint ventures is to be forged to tap the country's petroleum 
resources. 
  Wang revealed that Chinese and international oil firms are 
working on possible joint ventures in upstream as well as 
downstream operations. 
  Big projects can be expected to begin immediately once 
approved by the government, 
  China's oil industry, which annually produces 144 million 
tons of oil and 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas, has 
absorbed $15 billion in overseas investment over the past 16 
years. 
  Wang is leading a 54-member Chinese delegation to the 14th 
World Petroleum Congress opening today in Stavanger, Norway. 
  Wang said the oil delegation, the largest the country has 
ever sent abroad, will promote Chinese views and ideas on 
overcoming global challenges in energy development. 
  China, which is to host the 15th World Petroleum Congress in 
Beijing in 1997, expects important information to emerge in 
Stavanger. 
  The Chinese delegates are to cultivate foreign countries' 
views on energy development and discover new measures for 
protecting the environment. 
  "We hope exchanges on a wide range of topics in Norway will 
help pave the way for greater foreign co-operation," Wang said. 
  He praised China's oil development over the past 15 years, 
saying foreign co-operation has helped raise operations to a new 
stage. 
  Chief among the accomplishments are that: 
  --About one-fifth of the country's land has been opened to 
foreign oil exploration and development. 
  Foreign co-operation started 15 years ago in the country's 
offshore areas, and was extended onshore last year with the 
opening of international bidding for exploration in the Tarim 
desert basin in XinJiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  Wang said exploration contracts with foreign firms are being 
carried out. 
  Encouraged by China's open policies, foreign firms are not 
only exploring virgin territory but are also enhancing the 
recovery of oil in existing oilfields. 
  More than 70 foreign oil firms from 15 countries have 
applied 
for another round of bidding for onshore operations. Results of 
the bidding are due within three months. 
  The foreign firms expect to explore 26 blocks and start 11 
enhanced-recovery projects. 
  --Co-operative projects in oil refining and petrochemical 
manufacturing are expected to satisfy the rising demand in 
China, which anticipates 9 per cent economic growth in the next 
seven years. 
  --Foreign companies will also work with Chinese on 
engineering, technical research and equipment manufacturing. 
  Last year, CNPC signed $206 million worth of contracts for 
engineering and labour services abroad. The volume equalled the 
total for all of the 1980s. 
  --Preparations for overseas oil operations and financing are 
under way.

Xiaolin (1776 2556 3829) ] 
  [Text] Korla, 16 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--To date, the 
reserves of nine oil and gas fields have been verified in Tarim. 
By the end of last year, Tarim had produced an accumulated 
total of 3.23 million tonnes of crude oil. At present, the 
daily output of crude oil in Tarim has reached 6,000 tonnes, and 
the annual output of crude oil of this year is expected to be 
2.1 million tonnes. 
  Since oil prospecting and exploitation began in Tarim five 
years ago, the reserves of nine oil and gas fields, including 
Lunnan, Donghetang, Gatamu, Mulake, Jiefangqudong, Tazhongsi, 
Momai No 7, Hongqigou, and Tiergen, have been verified. 
Thirty-four industrial oil- and gas-bearing structures and 17 
high-yielding oil and gas wells and points have been discovered. 
This has fulfilled the state plan for ensuring reserves for the 
5-million-tonne production capacity during the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan. A series of major breakthroughs with strategic 
significance have also been made while prospecting in the region. 
  The discovery of the Tazhong 1-billion-tonne grade oil field 
with Tazhong No 4 as the main body in 1992 and the important 
discovery of the No 6 anticline of the No 10 structure in the 
northern slope zone of the Tazhong low swell in 1993 have 
unfolded the broad prospects for the discovery of large oil 
field group in the Tazhong area. In the Tazhong area, in 
addition to continued discoveries in the Lunnan and Donghetang 
Oil Fields, the general analysis on several structures of the 
Luntai broken swell has led to the discovery of four oil- and 
gas-bearing structures in the Momai No 7, the Yaha, and the 
Hongqi structures. A number of high-yielding oil and gas wells 
have been drilled. All this fully shows the gratifying 
prospects for the discovery of large oil and gas fields in the 
Tarim Basin. 
  Taking part in the prospecting and development of the Tarim 
Oil Field are over 10,000 people from the well-drilling teams in 
the six major oil fields in Huabei, Central Plain, Daqing, 
Sichuan, Shengli, and Xinjiang.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "China's Key Coal Mines Play a Growing Role"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China, in an effort to 
ensure a steady supply of coal to numerous power plants, 
factories and households, has given special emphasis to the 
building of key coal mines. 
  Dozens of key mines which enjoy preferential treatment in 
capital and raw material supply have been built over the past 
ten years to meet the growing demand. 
  "They have formed the backbone of the coal industry," said 
an 
official from the coal ministry. 
  China relies heavily on coal for its energy supply. 
Statistics show coal accounts for over 75 percent of the 
country's consumption of primary sources of energy. 
  By 1993, 45 key coal mines were completed with an increased 
production capacity of 110 million tons per year. Of the total, 
12 are classified as extra large mines each with annual 
production capacity well above three million tons. 
  China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year, ranking 
first in the world. 
  Experts said investment for those key mines over the past 
decade totalled 39.8 billion yuan, making up 44 percent of the 
gross budget for the coal industry. 
  Meanwhile, their production capacity, at 110 million tons 
annually, accounted for 56 percent of the total increase, the 
experts said. 
  China began listing coal mines as key construction projects 
in 1982 to escalate the development of the coal industry. Since 
then, the number of projects has been increased from eight to 
twenty-five. 
  Up to now, three projects have been completed. The remaining 
22 still under construction are on the list of 151 key projects 
for this year. 
  "This indicates China's preferential investment in energy 
and 
raw materials industries," which have been the bottleneck in 
China's economic development, said the official. 
  He said those key mines were characterized by their large 
scale, high speed and short construction period, indicating 
better returns on investment. 
  With advanced technology and equipment, those mines enjoy 
higher mechanization in coal production, he added. 
  At present, four coal mines -- Datong, Gujiao and Pingshuo 
of 
Shanxi Province and Huolinhe of Inner Mongolia -- boast annual 
production capacities of more than 10 million tons. 
  The official said that the construction of these mines 
played 
a pivotal role in stabilizing China's coal output and promoted 
China's development of the whole coal industry. 
  China will pour 6.78 billion yuan into the key projects and 
the production capacity of the mines under construction is 
expected to hit 79 million tons. 
  He admitted that problems still exist for these projects, 
such as a short supply of capital funds and building materials, 
which delay construction and put the projects behind schedule. 
  He suggested that a system be set up to guarantee and manage 
the supply of funds and building materials to ensure the smooth 
construction of the projects. 
  He said that the shortage of coal is bound to recur in the 
long run despite the present excess supply of coal on the 
domestic market. China plans to produce 1.4 billion tons of 
coal by the end of this century. 
  "The government should exert macro-control over the coal 
industry and make sure the key projects being carried out to 
keep abreast with China's economic development," he said.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Railroads Hope To Lure Investments From </F>
Abroad"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Railways is working on more 
"attractive" policies to lure direct overseas investment and 
management into its projects. 
  The move seeks to push railway development to catch up with 
rapid economic growth. 
  The policies will allow railway joint ventures to be set up 
and independently managed. Such commercial railways will have 
much more say in setting prices than State-run ones, a ministry 
official said. 
  The joint ventures will enjoy a wide spectrum of 
"attractive" 
treatment, such as pricing power and a wider business scope, 
such as railside real estate developments, to help balance 
foreign exchange. 
  "This will be a stimulus to foreign firms which are still 
hesitant to invest in railways with huge input and lengthy 
construction periods," said An Shunyi, deputy head of the 
ministry's Foreign Capital and Technical Import Office. 
  The coastal regions have been targeted with a list of 
lucrative rail projects for foreign investment, he said. The 
projects will not be revealed for several months. 
  Many experts suggest that the envisioned Beijing-Shanghai 
high-speed railway should be on the list. But the more than $10 
billion project still awaits final State approval. 
  Negotiations are taking place with an American firm to 
co-build the Zhangzhou-Chaozhou-Shantou line, which will stretch 
more than 300 kilometres in Fujian and Guangdong provinces. 
  And talks are continuing with a Canadian company on the 
100-kilometre Yantai-Lancun line in Shandong Province. 
  The government is also trying to soak up more overseas 
preferential loans to finance its modern railway network, 
according to An. 
  A total $3.7 billion from the Japanese Government and World 
Bank since 1980 has helped China complete 5,700 kilometres in 
new lines, rebuild 6,500 kilometres of old ones, and revamped 
six rolling stock plants. 
  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will grant a $200 million 
loan for technical enhancement of the Beijing-Kowloon line, 
which is under intense construction. 
  The agreement for the project is scheduled to be signed next 
month in Manila, signaling ADB's growing interest in China's 
national railways, rather than local lines. 
  The Japanese Government is preparing $2 billion as its 
fourth 
railway loan parcel to China. Agreements will be struck next 
Summer. 
  China will use the blessing to update the existing 
Zhuzhou-Guiyang line in the southwest, and build a new 
240-kilomtre line linking Xian and Ankang in the northwest. 
  It will also cover a railway and highway bridge spanning the 
Yangtze at Wuhu of Anhui Province, and probably the 
Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail project.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 29 (XINHUA) -- On the 5,800-km 
coastline around the Bohai Sea, more than 40 ports have 
undertaken expansion projects, with overseas investment being 
one of the main funding sources. 
  The area around the Bohai Sea, embracing the four provinces 
of Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei and Shanxi and the cities of 
Beijing and Tianjin, boasts many important ports whose combined 
handling capacity accounts for over 40 percent of the country's 
total. 
  The central government has recently listed it among the 
regions to be developed first in the next century, because of 
its large import and export volume--half of the nation's 
total--and its trade relations with over 160 countries and 
regions. 
  So far, Qingdao port has received a loan of 20 billion 
Japanese yen from the Japanese Government, and Dandong port, 20 
million U.S. dollars in loans from the Asia Development Bank. 
  Tianjin has also sought out cooperation with foreign 
investors. 
  At present, port construction has progressed smoothly in the 
area. 
  In Liaoning, the completion of the Dayaowan Project will 
enable Dalian port to claim an annual handling capacity of over 
100 million tons at the beginning of the next century, ranking 
the port as one of the world's largest. 
  Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province, the country's No. 1 port for 
coal exports, will show an increase of 30 million tons in annual 
handling capacity by 1996. 
  Tianjin, China's largest artificial port, will handle 60 
million tons of goods by the end of this century, when the 
ongoing projects of the Beijiang, Haihe and Nanjiang harbors are 
completed.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- China has decided to 
permit foreigners to invest in its civil aviation construction 
on condition that Chinese capital should exceed 51 percent of 
the total in any venture. 
  The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-Operation promulgated 
a circular to this effect here yesterday. 
  The document stipulates that overseas businessmen are 
allowed 
to construct runways and parking areas in China by means of 
investment or co-operation. But the Chinese investment should 
exceed 51 percent of the total registered capital of the joint 
venture and Chinese citizens should take the posts of the 
chairman of the board and the general manager. 
  However, the other managing personnel can be Chinese or 
foreigners. The taxation rates of these enterprises will be the 
same as those for Chinese ones. 
  Those who invest in the construction of runways or parking 
areas will be given priority for investing in the waiting rooms, 
warehouses, ground services, airplane maintenance and repair, 
flight food, hotels, restaurants, aircraft oil and other 
airport-affiliated facilities. 
  Meanwhile, the circular reiterated that air traffic control 
systems can only be funded and administered by the Chinese 
Government. 
  The circular gives the green light to foreign businessmen to 
set up air freight companies jointly with Chinese enterprises. 
It is also allowed for foreign investors to buy the shares of 
Chinese air shipping companies, provided that the foreign 
capital is below 35 percent of the total registered capital. 
  The circular stresses that overseas airports and the 
aircraft 
manufacturing companies are not allowed to set up air freight

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (CNS) -- Statistics from China's 
customs show that China's agricultural products lack 
competitiveness in the international market and its export of 
such products will not be optimistic this year. 
  According to the statistics, China's export value of 
agricultural products was U.S.$10.11 billion last year, 2.5 
percent up over the year before and making up 11.1 percent of 
the total export value in the country, indicating that such 
export was basically in a wandering state. Though the country 
saw a great growth in quantity of most agricultural products for 
export since there had been three years of good harvests in the 
country, resulting in a big increase of agricultural products 
and animal livestock, the country's export value of general 
trade, which is the main way for agricultural exports, was 
U.S.$7.61 billion last year, dropping by 12.4 percent. 
  Experts said that the decline in China's agricultural 
product 
competitiveness in the international market mainly resulted from 
the low quality and low prices of such products and the growth 
of such exports in the country mainly depended on the increase 
in amount of exports.

<F P=106> [By Yun He: "Modern Farm Techniques Promoted"] </F>
  [Text] China is encouraging farmers to adopt four crucial 
production techniques this year. 
  The techniques can help meet the government's 1994 target of 
3.5 percent growth in agricultural output, the Ministry of 
Agriculture said. 
  The techniques involve applying fertilizers to the subsoil, 
improving crop seeds, controlling bollworms and preventing 
diseases among prawn and livestock, and processing feed with 
straw and stalks. 
  Vice-Minister Hong Fuzen said the ministry is expecting 
foreign investors to bring advanced management skills and 
equipment to help spread this technology. 
  Hong said that at least two new generations of crop seeds 
should be developed during the rest of this century to push up 
farm production. 
  By the year 2000, he said, better seeds should account for 
at 
least 40 percent of the annual increases in agricultural output. 
  In the use of fertilizer, the central government will strive 
toward three major targets during the next five years: 
  --By 1998, subsoil fertilizer should be used on 66 million 
hectares of farmland, or 60 percent of China's grain acreage. 
  Hong said that only 12 million hectares are now fertilized 
by 
machine, adding that the figure is expected to rise to 46.7 
million hectares by 1998. 
  --The technology for applying nitrogenous fertilizer should 
spread across the countryside, and 40 percent of fertilized 
farmland is to be treated in this way. 
  --By effectively using fertilizer, the per hectare yield of 
wheat is expected to increase by 300 kilograms; of maize, by 375 
kilograms; of soybean, by 225 kilograms; and cotton, by 225 
kilograms. 
  With advanced technology, farmers are also expected to 
reduce 
their use of fertilizer by 180 kilograms per hectare by 1998, 
Hong said. 
  He reiterated that another crucial task is the vigorous 
development of pesticides to prevent animal and shrimp diseases 
and wipe out bollworms, both of which brought disaster to 
farmers last year. 
  In three to five years, Hong said, another 141 model 
counties 
will be designated to play leading roles in the development of 
feed-processing technology using straw and stalks, providing a 
stimulus to animal husbandry. At present, the country has 59 
model counties.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The "vegetable basket" 
program has become one of the important weapons used by the 
Chinese Government to curb inflation. 
  Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin and Li Peng have time and again 
since January this year called for redoubled efforts to increase 
supplies of vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and other non-staple 
food, which are common on the shopping lists of urban housewives. 
  The phrase "vegetable basket" program was coined in 1987, 
when it was designed by the Ministry of Agriculture to increase 
production and supply of farm produce to meet the growing market 
demand. 
  As the urban people's vegetable baskets are becoming fuller, 
however, the program has become so important that it is being 
used as one of the several important measures by the central 
government to curb price rises, mainly caused by excessive 
capital investment in 1992 and 1993. 
  The Chinese leaders have not only urged governments at all 
levels, at several national meetings this year, to pay more 
attention to this program, but have also made investigative 
tours of markets to curb excessive price rises of these products 
-- increases which caused many complaints by urban residents. 
  During a tour of markets in Beijing on January 19, President 
Jiang Zemin said that the matter of the "vegetable basket", 
meaning supply of vegetables and meat, eggs and milk, concerns 
every household and social stability. 
  He urged officials at all levels for continued efforts to 
increase production. 
  Just a week later, the State Council, China's cabinet, 
convened a national meeting on the "vegetable basket" program to 
boost production. 
  Premier Li Peng told the conference that as the income of 
the 
overwhelming majority of Chinese people is relatively low and 
food consumption constitutes a large proportion of living costs, 
the prices of food, such as grain and cooking oil, meat and 
vegetables have considerable influence on people's consumption. 
  The premier concluded that it is important for the 
government 
to ensure production and supplies of these products. 
  Li reiterated that the most important job for a mayor is the 
"vegetable basket" program. 
  The central and municipal governments have taken a number of 
measures to ensure a steady increase in production of 
vegetables, meat, milk and other products, such as more 
investment in production, preventing horticultural land in 
suburbs from being used for industrial development and reform in 
marketing networks. 
  Many large and medium-sized cities have set up funds to 
encourage more cultivated land to be used for vegetable 
production and to protect the interests of vegetable growers. 
  China's production of vegetables, meat, eggs and milk has 
been growing steadily over the past seven years since the 
program was initiated. 
  China last year produced a total of 37.8 million tons of 
meat, 11 million tons of eggs and 17 million tons of aquatic 
products, up at least 80 percent over 1987. 
  In addition, the milk output increased by 60 percent and 
vegetable output jumped by 50 percent to 220 million tons and 
fruit output was nearly 30 million tons, up 60 percent. 
  The per capita consumption of those products for urban and 
rural citizens is also on the increase. 
  For example, last year, the per capita average consumption 
of 
meat was 32 kg, compared with 18.4 kg seven years ago. 
  On average, a Chinese resident last year consumed 9.3 kg of 
eggs and 15 kg of aquatic products, while the figures were 5.5 
kg and 8.8 kg in 1987. 
  Agricultural production, such as grain, vegetable, meat, 
eggs 
and milk, is expected to keep steady growth since initial 
macro-control progress has been made in China's economy, such as 
a drop in fixed capital investment, a slow-down of the 
over-heated real estate market, and protection of arable land. 
The curbed activities had attracted lots of investment which 
ought to have gone to agriculture. 
  Therefore, sufficient supplies of grain, vegetables, meat, 
eggs and milk will mean lower prices of non-staple food, which 
will in turn contribute to the government's anti-inflation 
efforts.

  [Text] Washington, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank today 
approved a credit of 150 million U.S. dollars to help restore 
China's heavily eroded loess plateau and lift 1.2 million people 
out of poverty. 
  The bank said that soil erosion has made China's loess 
plateau "something like the surface of the moon," and that per 
capita income there is only about 35 to 50 dollars a year. 
  The bank said the project seeks to tackle the issue of 
poverty and the environment at the same time and is expected to 
increase grain production by 50 percent and fruit production by 
400 percent. 
  "The little rainfall the people get will be kept for crops 
and trees, where now it just runs off," said the bank's project 
manager Juergen Voegele. 
  "They will also be able to convert highly eroded areas to 
production, utilize river beds and move away from unproductive 
and unsustainable planting on sloping hillsides," he said. 
  The total cost of the project is close to 250 million 
dollars.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- According to the 
Ministry of Internal Trade, owing to larger rapeseed acreage 
this year, rapeseed output is expected to be higher than that of 
last year; and owing to arriving shipments of cooking oil 
imported with the State Council's approval, the cooking oil 
supply and demand are calming down in the market, and the price 
is quite stable. 
  As the supply of summer rapeseed will continue to increase 
in 
the market, the Ministry of Internal Trade and the State 
Administration of Grain Reserves yesterday issued a "Notice on 
Intensifying the Market Management of Cooking Oil and Doing a 
Good Job in Summer Rapeseed Purchasing." The notice says: 
While various localities are doing a good job and making quick 
progress in rapeseed purchasing, certain localities appear to be 
ready to fight a "big purchasing war" [shougou dazhan 2392 6356 
1129 2069] for rapeseed. 
  The notice urges state-operated grain departments to take 
effective measures to fulfill state-set quotas of purchasing 70 
to 80 percent of rapeseed needed for processing into cooking 
oil. It says: In each and every county, which should be 
treated as one unit, state-operated grain departments there must 
purchase rapeseed strictly in accordance with the collective 
plan and price. By no means should they compete with one 
another in purchasing rapeseed by offering a higher price, much 
less should they compete with buyers in other provinces by 
offering a higher price. Whoever has been found to do so in 
violation of regulations will have their grain and oil operating 
license revoked, their illegal profits confisticated, and the 
rapeseed they have purchased will be turned over to 
state-operated grain departments at a set price. Control in all 
channels must be intensified, and responsbilities must be 
prescribed and fulfilled. Under local governments' leadership, 
grain departments should work in close coordination with 
business, price, public security, and taxation departments; and 
share responsibilities with them in exercising stronger 
supervision over rapeseed purchasing and law enforcement so that 
normal market order can be maintained. To stabilize the cooking 
oil market, there should be effective measures for guarding 
against competitive rapeseed purchasing through various 
channels, and earnest efforts must be made to prevent a big war 
[da zhan 1129 2069] in rapeseed purchasing.

  [Text] Nanjing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Southern Jiangsu 
Province, east China, has taken the lead in the country in 
agricultural modernization. 
  Half of the output value created by farmers in the rural 
areas has come from scientific upgrading. 
  Southern Jiangsu, in the Chang Jiang River delta, covers 12 
counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the cities of 
Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou. The gross domestic product in the 
area has increased by 19.6 percent yearly since 1978, when China 
started its rural reform featuring the contract responsibility 
system with a family as the basic unit. 
  "Such a rate has exceeded the early economic development 
stage of Japan and the Republic of Korea," a local official said. 
  According to international standards, southern Jiangsu has 
entered the initial stage of modernization in agriculture, rural 
industrialization and urbanization. 
  These 12 counties and cities have been listed by the central 
government among the 100 counties in China with strong economic 
power. 
  The official noted that the average living space per capita, 
the expenditure on clothes, recreation and education and medical 
care, and the life-span of the people in most of these counties 
have surpassed the government-set quotas for a relatively 
comfortable life in rural areas. 
  He attributed the rapid economic growth in these counties to 
the popularization of science and technology. 
  A survey shows that more than 50,000 rural industrial 
enterprises in southern Jiangsu Province have established 
cooperative relations of various kinds with over 1,000 research 
institutions, universities and colleges. 
  More than 10,000 scientists and technicians across the 
country have settled down in these counties to help with 
economic expansion. 
  "Such a huge project to invite so many highly-trained people 
to work here was beyond the government's administrative 
capacity," the official noted. 
  By now, every county or city in southern Jiangsu has set up 
science development funds and agricultural development funds. 
  The annual amount of funds in science development allocated 
by the county and township governments accounts for at least one 
percent of the government's financial expenditure. 
  One example is Wuxi county, which spent 460 million yuan in 
1992, 1.28 billion yuan last year and three billion yuan this 
year on science and technology. 
  The county has contracted for 902 provincial and national 
projects for the development of sciences and new products over 
the past three years. 
  So far, southern rural Jiangsu has set up over 800 
scientific 
research institutions employing 200,000 scientists and 
technicians. 
  These institutions turn out more than 2,000 new research 
findings and products a year. 
  According to the official, the popularization of science and 
technology has helped widen the general knowledge and skills of 
rural laborers. 
  The nine-year compulsory education has been popularized in 
the 12 counties, where at least 90 percent of the rural 
industrial staff and workers have received technical training. 
  The official noted that a modern rural area with booming 
economy, developed science, beautiful surroundings and socialist 
civilization is being formed in southern Jiangsu Province.

  [Text] In April, the retail consumer goods market in our 
province maintained its momentum of vigorous development, with 
its total retail sales volume exceeding 2.2 billion yuan, a 28.7 
percent increase over the same period last year. Market 
operations in the whole province had the following features: 
  1. The gaps between the development of urban and rural 
markets were narrowed further, and the margin of increase in the 
rural market was 4.8 percent higher than that of the urban 
market. 
  2. The margin of increase of the retail volume in the 
catering trade was much higher than that of other trades. In 
April, the increase of the retail volume in the catering trade 
was 48.2 percent, mainly because food and drink prices have 
risen and people have upgraded their eating and drinking 
standards. 
  3. The retail volume of the agricultural means of production 
reached 620 million yuan, an increase of 120 percent over the 
same period last year. This showed that inputs in agriculture 
have been considerably increased, and that supply and marketing 
cooperatives have done a solid job in serving the peasants.

  [Text] Jinan, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The agriculture-based 
county towns of Ninghai and Beiyuan, in east China's Shandong 
Province, last year recorded a total industrial and service 
output value of over five billion yuan (about 577 million U.S. 
dollars). 
  With the advent of the reform and open policies some 15 
years 
ago the local farmers turned to industry and the service sector. 
Most of the farmers become industrial workers, service 
attendants or managers. Their average per capita income 
multiplied. 
  In the past ten years the township economy has developed 
rapidly in Shandong. The towns are now mostly equipped with 
water, electricity and program-controlled telecommunications as 
well as with department stores, schools and post offices. 
  Last year Shandong's total industrial and agricultural 
output 
value reached 696 billion yuan, a great increase over the 
previous year. The gross domestic product (GDP) was 270.09 
billion yuan, 4.3 times the figure for 1980. 
  The provincial government is developing small towns to 
absorb 
the surplus labor from the countryside. It is planned to 
transfer 10 million rural laborers from agriculture to the 
industrial and service sectors within six years. 
  In the construction of small towns the local government 
takes 
into account of their locations, natural resources and economic 
foundations, in order to build each town into a regional center 
for politics, economy, culture and communications.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's exhibition 
halls will be expanded by ten times in the coming three years. 
  According to a report provided by the Shanghai Uni-Trust 
Property Trust and Consultancy Company Ltd, many investors both 
at home and abroad have expressed desires to invest in the 
construction of exhibition halls in Shanghai to show their 
products and hold trade talks. 
  At present, the city has only four exhibition halls, with a 
combined area of less than 40,000 sq m. They hardly meet the 
needs of investors. 
  According to a plan, Shanghai will sponsor more than 60 
large 
international exhibitions and fairs in the near future.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai Steel Pipe 
Factory recently moved out of Shanghai city proper, and a new 
factory with an area a dozen times larger than the old one was 
set up on the outskirts. 
  The old premises are now used for science and technology and 
real estate development. 
  Moving industrial enterprises out of the city proper to make 
room for service trades is now well under way in Shanghai. 
  At present, there are nearly 1,000 industrial transformation 
programs oriented toward the Shanghai suburbs, and more than 200 
new industrial areas are emerging there. 
  As one of China's most economically advanced cities, 
Shanghai's real estate has obvious graded prices. For the 400 
pieces of land already allowed to be leased, the lowest price in 
the suburban area is 20 U.S. dollars per sq m, while the highest 
in the city proper has reached 5,000 dollars per sq m. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990s Shanghai has planned to 
divide the city into four functional areas -- a central trade 
area, commercial and trade area, suburban industrial band and 
second-grade market outskirts area, forming four concentric 
circles. 
  In the past two years nearly 100 financial and trade 
buildings have been set up in the center of the city, which 
provide quick and concentrated services for both domestic and 
foreign customers. 
  While secondary industry, in urgent need of funds for 
technical transformation and low-priced land for expansion, 
finds its location in the suburban areas. 
  Besides the factories, the residents in the old districts 
and 
government offices located in busy trade areas have also moved 
out. 
  It is estimated that about 300,000 people have already moved 
to new homes in the inner suburbs. And the number will increase 
along with the city's development. 
  It is noteworthy that dozens of government departments will 
move out of the waterside bund area and all the 37 buildings 
there will be leased to domestic and foreign financial 
institutions. Some government departments like the aviation 
bureau have already moved out. 
  This area, crowded with government departments for over 40 
years, may become a financial district just like that in New 
York's Manhattan.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Wang Shuzheng (3769 2885 2973) and </F>
Reporter Li Shujia (2621 1859 0163): "Resolutely Crack Down on 
and Stop the Illegal Transit of Textile Products"] 
  [Text] It was proposed at the provincial meeting on 
cracking down on and stopping the illegal trafficking of textile 
products held today that resolute efforts should be made to 
crack down on and stop the illegal trafficking of textile 
products. At the same time, it also warned enterprises to 
strictly guard against being fooled while dealing with the 
business of exports of textile products. 
  It was learned that some enterprises have failed to pay 
sufficient attention to the importance of cracking down on the 
illegal trafficking of textile products and the relevant 
policies. A small number of enterprises still have the idea of 
relying on luck and believe that illegal trafficking of textile 
products will not occur in their enterprises. Some enterprises, 
particularly the "three types of foreign-funded" enterprises, 
township enterprises, business companies which have newly been 
granted the rights to free management, and production 
enterprises know little about the relevant policies and 
situations. 
  The illegal trafficking of textile products has not only 
violated our country's relevant laws and regulations but also 
the international agreements and the relevant bilateral 
agreements, seriously sabotaging China's export order, creating 
a bad influence externally, and seriously damaging the interests 
of the state. 
  The meeting proposed: If our province's relevant enterprises 
are found to be involved in illegal trafficking of textile 
products, they will be criticized in a circular and their 
illicit gains and goods will be confiscated. They will also be 
punished with fines, have their textile product quota cut, and 
have their customs declaration right and their textile products 
export operational right temporarily suspended or abolished. At 
the same time, persons responsible will be questioned. If their 
cases are exceptionally serious, and they are found to have 
created great loses to the state and violated criminal law, they 
will be transferred to judicial organs to have their criminal 
liabilities investigated.

and offenders. 
  During the open trial, the city intermediate court sentenced 
a 20-year imprisonment with a 3-year deprivation of political 
rights to Liu Yuming, who had committed the crimes of diverting 
and embezzling public funds. A 10-year imprisonment with a 
3-year deprivation of political rights, was the court sentence

Bank of China and had committed the crimes of receiving bribes 
and embezzling the public funds. It also sentenced a 6-year 
imprisonment to Yang Changbiao, who was the former director of

Hohhot central branch of People's Construction Bank of China and 
had committed the crimes of being a broker of bribes, to 3-year 
imprisonment with 4-year's probation. 
  Liu Yuming, the former director of the small local branch on 
Beir Road under the second Hohhot branch of People's 
Construction Bank of China, successively diverted 2.551 million 
yuan of public funds by taking advantage of his post and right 
and lending them to others. Prior to the exposure of the case, 
he returned 927,000 yuan to the branch and after the case, he 
also returned 1.492 million yuan to it. Up to present, he still 
owes 101,800 yuan to the branch. 
  During the open trial, the city intermediate court also 
sentenced Sui Guizhen, a robbery convict; Zhang Xuefei, an 
intentional murder convict; and Tian Yunfeng, Xie Weimin, and

(2089 1606 5685) and Correspondent Mu Ren (3668 0088): "The 
Whole Jining-Tongliao Railway Line Has Been Opened To Traffic"] 
  [Excerpt] Representing both construction sides, Wang Qun, 
secretary of the autonomous regional party committee and Sun 
Yongfu, vice minister at the State Ministry of Railways, laid at 
1000 on 18 May, the last railway track for the Jining-Tongliao 
railway line, the longest local railway line in China. That 
moment marked the conclusion of three years and 10 months of 
valiant struggle to open the whole railway line to traffic, and 
the conclusion of Inner Mongolia's history of having no local 
railway line within its hinterland. This railway line is 943 
kilometers in length, and total investment in this railway line 
is 1.8 billion yuan. 
  The Jining-Tongliao railway line was built with investment 
cooperatively offered by the autonomous regional people's 
government and the Ministry of Railways. It is the longest 
local railway line in China. Construction on this railway line 
was completed in four years, this May, one year ahead of 
schedule. 
  Song Zhimin, vice chairman of the regional government, 
chaired the ceremony to celebrate the connection of the last 
track in Linxi. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party 
committee; Zhang Yongfu, vice minister at the Ministry of 
Railways; Chen Puru, honorary president of the national local 
railways association; Li Xiangyi, general manager of the Inner 
Mongolia local railway company; and representatives of road 
construction model workers cut the ribbons for the track 
connecting ceremony. Shen Shuji, vice chairman of the regional 
government, made a speech at the ceremony. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Through the year-long arrangements and construction, 
the Neimenggu economic radio and television broadcasting station 
has basically completed preparations for transmitting its 
economic television programs that will be presented with an 
entirely new look to the broad masses of viewers on 18 May. 
  While deepening its internal reform and accelerating its 
business development, the autonomous regional radio and 
television broadcasting department, decided in May 1993 to 
establish a new mass medium, the Neimenggu economic radio and 
television broadcasting station, responsible for its own income 
and expense. This was then approved by the autonomous regional 
people's government and the Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television. Thanks to the year of effort and the enthusiastic 
support and assistance given by various social circles, the 
preparation and construction work for this station has been 
completed. On 18 May, the station will transmit its economic TV 
programs on a trial basis on channel 26 and its programs will be 
joined by Neimenggu and Hohhot cable television broadcasting 
stations as it is fed into the broadcasting network. In addition 
to the daily relay of the "news hookup" from the central 
broadcasting station, the region's economic television station 
will transmit "children cartoons", "television theater", "US 
television programs digest", and "well-selected domestic and 
foreign films and TV programs". It will also provide its own 
columns, such as "economic news", "economic hot line", 
"information slot", "ETV evening service", "dream about 
factories", "health guidance", "reporter being beside you", and 
"regular weekend train".

  [Text] Tianjin, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China's third biggest 
city Tianjin will be built into a commercial and trade center in 
northern China through a 20-year effort, Gao Dezhan, secretary 
of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China, 
recently told XINHUA. 
  Once known as the country's second biggest business and 
banking center next to Shanghai, Tianjin is now taking a number 
of forceful steps in an overall development strategy to restore 
its prestige, the official said. 
  In the coming two years, Gao said, Tianjin will focus its 
effort on building 10 more influential markets for banking, 
labor, technology and information, real estate and enterprise 
property transference. 
  So far it has built and put into operation some 28 national 
and regional markets for various commodities and means of 
production. 
  Tianjin will also boost the development of township 
enterprises and overseas-funded joint ventures, he said, adding 
that the pace of state-owned enterprise restructuring will be 
quickened as well. 
  In addition, the city will accelerate the building of some 
major projects such as the auto industrial company with an 
annual output of 150,000 autos and the 140,000-ton ethylene and 
200,000-ton polyester production plants. The construction of 
the Tianjin seaside development area will also be accelerated. 
  Gao, past governor of northeast China's Jilin Province and 
forestry minister, said Tianjin now has four major industries of 
machinery, electronics, chemicals and metallurgy with an output 
value accounting for 70 percent of the city's industrial total. 
  And by the year 1996, he said, the city's profit and tax are 
expected to double the amount of last year, to exceed 11 billion 
yuan. 
  In the development of China's Bohai Bay economic rim and the 
Beijing-Tianjin economic ring, Tianjin will play an important 
role, the official said.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, a leading port 
city and manufacturing center in north China, is becoming the 
largest financial center in the area. 
  Shi Jiliang, governor of the Tianjin branch of the People's 
Bank of China, the country's central bank, said that money 
raised in the Tianjin financial market amounted to 36.6 billion 
yuan in 1993, next only to the financial market in Shanghai. 
  He said that Tianjin ranks second among the eight largest 
financial markets in China -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, 
Guangzhou, Xian, Chongqing, Wuhan and Shenyang. 
  Tianjin currently has 1,598 financial institutions, 
including 
1,048 banks, employing a total of 34,000 people. 
  Governor Shi described the financial sector as a "driving 
force" behind Tianjin's economic growth. 
  "Tianjin's financial sector has continued its strong growth 
since the beginning of this year," he said. 
  For example, banks in the city took in 65 billion yuan in 
savings deposits and extended 80 billion yuan in loans in the 
first four months of 1994. 
  Shi said that the rapid growth of the financial sector was 
due primarily to the reform of the financial system over the 
past few years. 
  As a result, Tianjin has introduced a new financial system, 
with the state-owned banks as the mainstay, and non-banking 
institutions and foreign banks as the subsidiary. 
  The system also consists of an inter-bank borrowing and 
lending market, a securities market and a foreign exchange swap 
market. 
  To date, financial institutions in other parts of China have 
set up 38 subsidiaries in Tianjin, Shi said. 
  Since October 1992 banks from Britain, France and the United 
States have opened 12 branches in Tianjin, he added. 
  The Tianjin securities trading center now has 300 trading 
seats, three trading halls and 213 members, he said, adding that 
5.6 billion worth of treasury bonds changed hands there in the 
first quarter of 1994. 
  "The foreign exchange market in Tianjin is brisk, too," Shi 
said. 
  In the first four months of this year, about 500 million 
U.S. 
dollars changed hands in the Tianjin foreign exchange swap 
center, providing an impetus to the growth of foreign-funded 
firms and export-led companies, he said. 
  Speaking of the financial reform, Shi Jiliang said that it 
is 
imperative to improve macro-economic control means and the 
financial market, and introduce an efficient operational system 
in specialized state-owned banks. 
  To this end, existing specialized banks will be turned into 
commercial banks, a financial supervisory system instituted and 
intermediate financial agencies established, he said. 
  He also revealed that Tianjin plans to open the country's 
third stock exchange in the future, after Shanghai and Shenzhen.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Foreign-funded 
enterprises are taking an increasingly important role in the 
economy of this north China port city, according to the 
foreign-funded enterprises list for 1993 released by the Tianjin 
Statistics Bureau Tuesday [31 May]. 
  According to the list, there were 56 foreign-funded 
enterprises last year with sales value of over 50 million yuan 
(about 5.7 million U.S. dollars) each. Their total sales value 
reached 11 billion yuan (about 1.26 billion U.S. dollars). 
  A Sino-American joint venture, the Tianjin Otis Elevator Co. 
Ltd, is at the top of the list, with over one billion U.S. 
dollars-worth of annual sales. 
  Many of the listed enterprises are world-famous 
transnational 
companies like America's Motorola, Philip Morris and Coca-Cola, 
Japan's NEC, Honda and Yamaha, France's Hennessy and Italy's 
Zanussi. 
  The products of these foreign-funded enterprises vary from 
food, machinery and medicines to clothes, with most of them 
becoming hot sellers in Mainland China. 
  In the first four months of this year foreign-funded 
enterprises in Tianjin continued to boom, with sales income 
increasing 1.17 times over the same period of last year. 
  So far, the number of contracted foreign-funded enterprises 
has reached 7,000.

  [Text] On 31 May, accompanied by Wang Xianmin, standing 
committee member and secretary general of the provincial party 
committee, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, visited the office of the provincial government, met 
with responsible comrades of the provincial government and its 
overall departments, exchanged ideas with them, and discussed 
with them the great matter of developing Heilongjiang. 
  Tian Fengshan, acting governor of the provincial government; 
and Cong Fukui, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, and Wang Zongzhang, 
vice governors of the provincial government, were present at the 
meeting. 
  Yue Qifeng said that we should further deeply study the 
third 
volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and use 
the theory on building the socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to liberate and army our ideas and to guide our 
work. 
  Yue Qifeng said: How to strengthen and improve the 
leadership of the party is also an important issue. We should 
bring into full play the functions of the government and its 
functional departments. The provincial party committee will go 
all out to support the work of the government. 
  In regard to the economic work, Yue Qifeng said: I agree to 
the ideology of extension in five aspects and acceleration in 
two aspects. The key is [words indistinct]. To really target 
and see results, we should emancipate the mind and change our 
ideas, the party as a whole should be mobilized, and all people 
should go into action. It is necessary to achieve the 
transformation and reform of state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises and to develop agriculture. We should also 
cultivate new economic growing points and pioneer the second 
battle field for the economy. That is, we should vigorously 
develop town and township enterprises, the industries run by 
districts and neighborhood committees, private and individual 
enterprises, three types of foreign-funded enterprises, the 
tertiary industry, and new high-tech enterprises. The 
governments at various levels should emancipate the mind, create 
conditions, offer policies to support the development of the 
enterprises and industries of these kinds. All departments 
should deeply conduct investigations and study and work out 
methods. Only by so doing will the ideology of five extensions 
and two accelerations not become an empty talk. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Local officers should do deeds for 
localities. We should pay attention to the development of the 
local economy. Only when the local economy is developed will the 
overall situation be better inspired. 
  Yue Qifeng said: How to build our party in the new 
historical period is an important task. The issues of what we 
should grasp to promote party building, who should grasp party 
building, and how to grasp party building should be explored. 
Viewing the general situation, we know that party building and 
the spiritual civilization are still two weak links at present. 
We should not only see that our party has prestige, combat 
effectiveness, and prospects but also not ignore the existing 
problems. So, we should persist in the principle of being sure 
that both hands are tough. 
  Acting Governor Tian Fengshan set forth requirements for the 
work of the provincial government. 
  He said: The major task of the provincial government is to 
implement to the letter the principles and policies of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council and the policy decisions 
of the provincial party committee. What is the most important 
task at present is that the leaders at various levels should 
concentrate their energy, be inspired with enthusiasm, be 
diligent in performing their official duties, quietly immerse 
themselves in hard work, and achieve their work in a 
down-to-earth manner. The leaders at various levels should go 
deep to the rural areas and enterprises, get in touch with the 
grass roots, and bravely overcome difficulties and solve 
problems. The government should embody the policy of taking a 
two-hand approach in dealing with its work, ensure the smooth 
implementation of government decrees, strengthen the improvement 
of administrative honesty and diligence, resolutely correct the 
unhealthy trends within trades, firmly foster the thinking of 
service, and build itself into a government with high efficiency 
and administrative honesty and enjoying prestige among the 
masses of the people.

2734): "The Social Safety Situation of the Whole Province is 
Basically Stable"] 
  [Text] In order to realistically guarantee political and 
social stability in our province, the Provincial People's 
Congress standing committee organized a law enforcement 
inspection group with Li Yongjin as the leader and Zhang 
Zhenhuan, Gao Yongtang, and Zhou Xinren as the deputy leaders to 
travel to Shijiazhuang city, Baoding city, Tangshan city, and 
Qinhuangdao city on 5-13 May to respectively inspect their 
situations in implementing the "decision of the National 
People's Congress standing committee on strengthening 
comprehensive management of social safety," and the "Hebei 
Provincial regulation on comprehensive management of social 
safety." 
  The inspection group held that our province has done much 
work in implementing the "decision" and the "regulation," and 
achieved noticeable results in the comprehensive management of 
social safety. The whole province, from the urban to the rural 
areas, has witnessed a basically stable social safety situation 
and the masses of people have generally enhanced their sense of 
safety, and promoted the sound development of reform, opening 
up, and economic construction. The main expressions are: first, 
leaders at all levels have paid great attention to social 
safety, and all localities have conducted activities aimed at 
social safety comprehensive management work every year, thus 
promoting the progress of the comprehensive management of public 
safety work. Second, we have established and improved the 
social safety comprehensive management organs and 
conscientiously implemented the system of having leaders assume 
responsibility. The system of having leaders assume full 
responsibility over comprehensive management of social safety 
work has been basically implemented in most localities. Third, 
the work of "dealing strict blows" and improving social safety 
has been unceasingly deepened and noticeable results, 
particularly in this year's "spring offensive" on dealing blows 
to all sorts of crimes, have been achieved. Fourth, all 
departments and all sectors have jointly grasped and managed 
this work, and the committees and units for comprehensive 
management of social safety have given play to their functions 
and roles, particularly the various public safety organs have 
played a key role in the comprehensive management of social 
safety work. Fifth, fairly big progress has been made in the 
basic work of the grass-roots level. We have reshuffled and 
replenished the safety and people's mediation organizations and 
established security joint-defense teams, patrol teams, and mass 
safety organizations in line with the needs. Many localities 
have formed mass safety management networks. 
  Through law enforcement inspection, the inspection group 
pointed out: At present, some destabilizing factors have still 
existed, and the social safety situation has remained severe. 
Criminal cases, particularly major criminal cases, are still in 
an upward trend in some localities and some repulsive phenomena 
and law-breaking acts, such as abducting and selling women and 
children, prostitution and patronizing prostitutes, and 
manufacturing and selling obscene articles, have appeared 
despite repeated prohibitions; "hot topics" which the masses 
have complaints have increased in number, and accidental events 
have occurred frequently. The problems of being "tough with one 
hand and soft with the other hand" and failing to effectively 
crack down on serious criminal offenses have still existed in 
some localities. Some localities are fairly weak in their basic 
work at the grass-roots level, and some of their social safety 
comprehensive management measures are not implemented well. 
According to the situation revealed in the inspection, the 
Provincial People's Congress standing committee called on all 
localities to act in line with the demands of the "decision," 
conscientiously implement the "regulation," comprehensively 
strengthen social safety comprehensive management work, and push 
it to a new stage.

<F P=106> [Article by Sun Zhiwu (1327 1807 2976): "Issues on the </F>
Shareholding Transformation of State-Owned Enterprises and 
Measures To Address Them"] 
  [Text] The shareholding system is a form of enterprises' 
organization, which suits the needs of the socialist market 
economy and is effective in separating ownership from managerial 
power and pushing enterprises to the market. However, we have 
to probe and address the specific issues that still exist on how 
to make the shareholding transformation truly invigorate 
enterprises and how to operate state-owned property more 
effectively. 
  1. The issue on rationalizing the purposes and the 
behaviors. 
Motives are varied for people to feel enthusiastic for the 
shareholding transformation of enterprises. Individuals who buy 
stocks wish to become rich. Some enterprises conduct the 
shareholding transformation either for the purpose of raising 
funds to develop themselves and repay debts or for winning 
preferential policies, and others do so as they are ordered. 
Government departments chiefly want to promote reform or to 
show off their reform achievements. The objective existence of 
the various purposes of the shareholding transformation should 
be permitted, but effective policy and organizational measures 
should be drawn up to standardize the behaviors of the various 
sectors so that their purposes and behaviors will become 
rational and the healthy development of the shareholding 
transformation can be guaranteed. 
  This writer holds that the shareholding transformation of 
state-owned enterprises is, in essence, a reform of the 
organizational system of the ownership of state-owned assets and 
a change in the measures for operating the ownership of 
state-owned assets. The purpose of the reform, from the 
microeconomic viewpoints, is to suit the needs in developing the 
market economy and, through the change in the organizational 
form of state-owned assets, to rationalize enterprises' property 
right relations, determine the legal person status of 
enterprises, strengthen enterprises' internal mechanism of 
restraint, and manage the value of state-owned assets. From 
macroeconomic viewpoints, the purpose is to effectively develop 
the leading role of state economies, adjust the operating scope 
and structure of state-owned assets, establish a perfect 
monetary market system, and improve the mechanism for the 
optimal distribution of state-owned assets. When the purposes 
of the shareholding transformation of state-owned enterprises 
are clarified, we should, starting from the experimenting period 
of the reform, attach great importance to the organic 
combination of reform with development and with management and 
strengthen the specialized functions of the departments in 
charge of the ownership of state-owned assets and the 
macro-control and guiding role of the departments in charge of 
overall economic functions and the departments in charge of 
various trades, so that the shareholding transformation will 
truly facilitate the change of enterprises' operating mechanism 
and the adjustment of the industrial structure. 
  2. The issue on defining property rights and appraising 
assets. Unclear enterprise property ownership is a common and 
major difficulty and obstacle to the current shareholding 
transformation. Under the traditional planned economy system, 
enterprises' property right relations and their administrative 
relations were identical, but the property ownership relations 
of many enterprises have become very complicated due to the 
several changes in the managerial system. In some enterprises, 
ownership has changed several times due to historical reasons. 
Their assets were first invested by collectives and then 
invested by local government departments. This plus their later 
implementation of the managerial system similar to local 
state-owned enterprises has resulted in the very unclear 
original property right relations and the great change in the 
property right owners, making it very complicated to define the 
property right. In addition, unified and clear policy 
regulations are lacking on the ownership of the property 
resulting from tax reduction and exemption and the definition of 
central and local ownership of state-owned property. 
  This writer holds that the definition of property right is 
a kind of policy work concerning not only the protection of the 
rights and interests of the ownership of state-owned property 
but also the appraisal of relevant historical policies. It 
requires that the state study and formulate unified policies. 
  When enterprises' property right is clarified, appraisals of 
assets are needed, which involve the standards for the 
appraisals and the measures for converting assets into shares. 
As far as specific work is concerned, there are two measures. 
One is converting assets into shares according to the original 
book value and using the income from selling the shares at 
higher prices to make up for the losses resulting from the 
appreciation of the assets after the appraisals. The other is 
converting the assets into shares according to their appraised 
value. This writer holds that the former is not a proper 
measure. First, the current shareholding transformation of 
state-owned enterprises is conducted on the basis of the newly 
established limited liability stock companies or limited 
liability companies. It is not meant to increase the funds and 
expand the original state-owned stock companies. Therefore, the 
transformation, in fact, consists of two stages: 1) making 
inventory of the original assets or some assets of enterprises 
and determining the current prices of the assets and 2) 
establishing new shareholding enterprises and canceling the 
original legal person status of enterprises. By then, the 
original assets of enterprises, as the property of the founders 
of the new enterprises, are invested in the new enterprises 
along with the property of other shareholders to become the 
capital of the new enterprises. The combination of the 
appraisals of enterprises' original assets with the fund raising 
of new enterprises embodies the principle of same profits for 
same shares, and assets should be converted into shares 
according to the current prices only. Second, correct 
appraisals of assets and converting them into shares constitute 
the key to safeguarding the proper rights and interests of the 
various beneficiaries. If the original state-owned assets of 
enterprises are converted into shares according to the book 
value and the difference between the book value and the 
appraised value is made up for with the income from selling the 
shares at higher prices, the rights and interests of state-owned 
shareholders and other shareholders, no doubt, will be damaged. 
  3. The issue on converting the right to the use of 
state-owned land into shares. Many enterprises, especially 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, take up large 
areas of land, and some of them are even located in the 
high-priced "golden" sections of cities. If all the land use 
right is converted into shares, the value of the assets of these 
enterprises will be doubled and redoubled, and the profit rate 
of the assets will definitely decline, which is detrimental for 
shareholding enterprises to attract investment from society when 
they issue shares. In doing their specific work, all localities 
have adopted fairly flexible ways to handle this issue. This 
writer holds that the essence of this issue is the optimization 
of the efficiency in operating the two types of state-owned 
assets (the original assets of state-owned enterprises and the 
right to the use of state-owned land). We should correctly 
distinguish the state-owned land used as assets and that used as 
resources and include the right to the use of the state-owned 
land that is converted into shares in the management of 
state-owned assets. Meanwhile, to improve the efficiency in 
using and operating state-owned land, the right to the use of 
state-owned land should be managed like enterprises, and 
companies specializing in the management of assets should be 
established to change the administrative management of assets. 
  An enterprise should consider two factors to determine 
whether to convert the land use right into shares. On the one 
hand, the advantage in converting land use right into shares is 
the increase in the state-owned capital of the enterprises 
transformed in line with the shareholding system and the 
reduction of cost resulting from the exemption of the new 
shareholding enterprises from paying rent for the land. The 
disadvantage is the decline of the profit rate of enterprise 
assets during the transformation, which makes the shares less 
attractive. On the other hand, when the land use right is not 
converted into shares, the shares of the enterprises become more 
attractive, but state-owned funds will decrease because the 
operation cost of the transformed new enterprises will increase 
after they pay rents for the land. Under such circumstances, 
initiators of the new shareholding enterprises will have to 
weigh the cost of fund raising upon establishment and the later 
cost of operation; and managers of the right to the use of 
state-owned land will have to weigh the collection of dividends 
and the collection of rents. 
  4. The issue on the shareholding transformation of some 
assets of enterprises. The shareholding transformation of 
state-owned enterprises can be conducted in two ways. One is 
transforming all the assets of the enterprises, which leads to 
the cancellation of the legal person status of the enterprises. 
The other is transforming some assets of enterprises and, while 
retaining the legal person status of the enterprises, 
establishing new shareholding enterprises whose shares are also 
held by the original legal persons. Due to numerous reasons, 
some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have 
difficulty in transforming all their assets for the time being. 
They tend to convert some of their assets (certain branch 
plants or workshops) into shares. This writer holds that both 
ways are feasible, but attention should be given to the 
following when doing specific work. First, both ways of 
transformation are restructuring of the ownership of state-owned 
assets, on which the ultimate decisions should be made by the 
owners of the assets of the enterprises, namely the government, 
and which should be included in the local plans for the 
operating scope, organization, and structural adjustment of 
state-owned assets and never be decided by enterprises 
themselves just because they transform some of their assets. 
Second, the shareholding transformation of some assets should 
be conducted in such a way that they hold the legal person 
status. In other words, when transformed in line with the 
shareholding system, these parts of the assets are separated 
from and become subcompanies of the original enterprises and 
hold the civil responsibilities independently with their own 
property. Third, attention should be given to the difference 
between transformation of all the assets and transformation of 
some parts of the assets. Generally speaking, the former is the 
lateral reform of the organizational system of the property 
right of state-owned enterprises, which, in general, leads to a 
change in the enterprises from ones exclusively funded by the 
state into shareholding ones with mixed ownership. The latter 
is the vertical reform of the organization of the property right 
of state-owned enterprises, which leads to a dual ownership of 
state-owned assets, splitting the enterprise assets directly 
owned by the state formerly into two parts, with one directly 
owned by the state and the other indirectly owned by the state. 
Due to the different structure of property right, the 
government will adopt different ways to manage their property 
right.

  [Text] On 28 May, Wuchang city was hit by a series of three 
hailstorms. More than 510,000 mu of farmland in the city were 
afflicted at varying degrees, creating direct economic losses 
amounting to almost 10 million yuan. At present, peasants 
across the city are taking steps to combat disaster and to 
provide for and help themselves, and have decided to minimize 
the losses caused by the disaster. 
  During these hailstorms, 23 townships and towns in Wuchang 
city were affected, and the afflicted areas accounted for 21 
percent of total cultivated land. 
  After the outbreak of disaster, the city leaders organized 
relevant departments to go deep to the disaster areas in time to 
help the masses formulate anti-disaster measures. At the same 
time, they also helped the disaster areas to resolve the issue 
of funds totalling 130,000 yuan, 50 tonnes of diesel oil, and 
over 50,000 kg of early ripening crop seeds. All city-level 
units responsible for helping the disaster areas also went deep 
to townships and towns to help disaster-stricken masses resolve 
the issue of goods badly needed for the people's production and 
living. Activities of donating funds and articles are being 
carried out. At present throughout the city, more than 500,000 
mu of farm crops for reseeding and transplanting has been 
destroyed.

  [Text] The 10th anniversary of the promulgation of China's 
present military service law will fall on 31 May this year. To 
mark this anniversary, the provincial party committee, the 
provincial government, and the provincial military region 
jointly held a report meeting on national defense education at 
the auditorium of the organs of the provincial party committee 
on the morning of 27 May. 
  Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the meeting. Leading Comrades He 
Zhukang, Shi Zhaoping, Gu Changchun, (Yuan Zaiping), (Ba Gula), 
(Zhang Kezhen), (Yang Qingning), and (Hu Pinggui) as well as 
cadres at or above the deputy department level and the section 
level of the organs directly under the provincial authorities, 
more than 800 persons in total, listened to the report made by 
Qian Bo, deputy commander of the provincial military district, 
entitled "Performing Military Service Duty According to Law, and 
Vigorously Building National Defense." 
  In his report, Qian Bo again [words indistinct] and analyzed 
the significance of the military service law in building 
national defense. [passage indistinct] The army officers 
transferred to civilian work and the retired armymen placed in 
the province have made great contributions to building the 
province on various fronts and to building the socialist 
material and spiritual civilizations. The province has persisted 
in the principle of letting the party manage the armed forces 
and have energetically strengthened the building of militia and 
reserve service forces, thus enabling the province's national 
defense and reserve forces to grow and expand in the course of 
carrying out reform and opening up. Since the beginning of this 
year, a total of 600,000 militiamen and reserve service men have 
participated in [words indistinct] and have undertaken and 
completed more than 100 construction projects. Since 1992 in 
particular, militia and reserve service forces in the province 
have energetically launched the activities of contributing to 
invigorating Jilin's economy, thus being much praised by the 
masses. 
  Wang Jinshan made a speech at the conclusion of the report 
meeting. He pointed out: Qian Bo's report has stressed on a 
variety of contents, ranging from history to present, from the 
world to the domestic China, from the economy to national 
defense, from the content of the law to the enforcement of the 
law, and from achievements to problems. On the occasion of 
marking the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the present 
military service law, we should conscientiously master this law 
in the course of studying, propagating, and implementing it. 
  Wang Jinshan pointed out in his speech: We should make 
greater efforts to profoundly launch the activities of studying 
and propagating the military service law throughout the 
province. We should spread the ideas that performing military 
service according to law is the bound duty of citizens and 
showing concern for and supporting the building of national 
defense is the duty of the whole society. We should regularize 
the propaganda of national defense building, with the military 
service law as the major content, in order to firmly foster 
throughout the province the sense of national defense, the sense 
of the legal system, and the idea of preforming military service 
according to law. In combination with the studying and 
propaganda of the military service law, we should inspect and 
summarize the items stipulated by the military service law, and 
then find out problems in order to enforce the law in a 
down-to-earth manner. 
  In his speech, Wang Jinshan stressed: Leading cadres at all 
levels should be fully aware of their exemplary and leading role 
and should serve as the model in studying, propagating, and 
implementing the military service law. At the same time, 
leaders of party committees and governments at all levels should 
firmly grasp the principle of letting the party manage armed 
forces, actually list the armed forces work as a major item of 
their daily agenda, show concern for and support the national 
defense building, and resolve some major problems and adopt 
correct policy decisions in a timely manner in order to ensure 
the successful building of reserve forces and the successful 
fulfillment of all military tasks.

8673 3123): "Changtu's Extraordinarily Serious `Grain Materials' 
Hidden Case Exposed to the World"] 
  [Text] The details of the extraordinarily serious hidden 
case of law breaches in the purchases of materials by the grain 
departments of Changtu County, about which the people across the 
province are deeply concerned, have been exposed and known to 
all thanks to the six months of all-out efforts by the Tieling 
city and Tieling County procuratorial organs to investigate the 
case. It has been ascertained that the case had incurred an 
economic loss of 68.22 million yuan to the state as calculated 
by grain departments after making an inventory and check of 
their stockpiles and capital. A total of 412 persons have been 
punished according to party and administrative disciplinary 
actions and criminal law or through economic sanctions; and 11 
persons against whom lawsuits have been filed will be tried in 
the near future. 
  Changtu County is a renowned grain producer in the country, 
which purchases about 1 billion kg of grain every year. Dozens 
of materials in large amounts, such as straw mats and stripes, 
are needed in grain storage. Due to poor management, grain 
departments of the county committed a large number of law 
breaches during purchases of the materials since 1990. 
Beginning September 1993, cadres and policemen of the Tieling 
City Procuratorate and the Changtu County Procuratorate made 
all-out efforts to investigate the case based on the reports by 
the masses and the written instructions by the principal leading 
comrades of the city party committee. In the process of 
handling the case, the standing committee of the Tieling city 
party committee heard reports on the progress on many occasions 
and gave timely support and guidance. This case also drew the 
extremely great attention of Supreme People's Procuratorate and 
the provincial procuratorate. Zhao Dengju, deputy chief 
procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, came to 
Changtu County to hear reports on the case, which signified a 
great encouragement to the procuratorial cadres and policemen. 
Neither moved by money nor interfered by personal relations, 
the cadres and policemen surmounted numerous difficulties and 
managed to expose the case which, centering on Gui Bingquan, 
former director of the Changtu County Grain Bureau, involved 
some leading cadres and personnel of party and government 
organs, public security, procuratorial, and judicial 
departments, law-enforcing administrative departments, and 
economic management departments, who traded power for power, 
money, personal favor, and sex and cheated the state of a 
tremendous amount of money to line their pockets. 
  According to Wu Zhicheng, chief procurator of the Tieling 
City People's Procuratorate, the city and the county 
procuratorial organs have put on files for investigations 54 
persons involving in serious and major offenses, such as 
embezzlement, bribe-taking, speculation, profiteering, 
dereliction of duty, extortion, misuse of public funds, 
swindling, and tax evasion, and two of them are cadres at deputy 
county level. Xu Lianzhong, former vice chairman of the county 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, Gui Bingquan, former director of the county grain 
Bureau, and 12 others were arrested and brought to justice. 
Eleven serious offenders at large were listed as wanted, and 
some others were bailed out waiting for trials. As much as 32 
million yuan of illicit money was seized. 
  Judging by the criminal facts exposed, the case was a 
shocking one. The large number of departments and persons 
involved, the great loss incurred to the state, and the evil 
means adopted by the lawless elements made the case a rare one 
in Liaoning in recent years. According to the investigations, 
the overwhelming majority of the 36 grain depots violated laws 
at varying degrees during the purchases of materials. Gui 
Bingquan and others abused power to give written approvals 
wantonly for some persons to sell materials regardless of the 
needs of the grain depots, through which they took bribes or 
enabled their relatives and friends to make huge profits. 
Persons obtaining the approvals then forcibly sold materials to 
grain depots to reap staggering profits. Some lawless persons 
used the approvals to collude with relevant personnel of grain 
depots in making false receipts and certificates of the storage 
of the materials, cheating the grain depots out of money without 
even selling the materials. Moreover, Gui Bingquan's written 
approvals were directly sold. A written approval with some 
dozen poorly written characters was sold at tens of thousands of 
yuan at the lowest, the highest price being 135,000 yuan. A 
relative of Gui Bingquan earned more than 200,000 yuan from 
selling the approvals. Some women even sold their bodies in 
exchange for the approvals. 
  This law-violating case brought a tremendous economic loss 
to 
the state. The price for materials the county's grain 
departments bought were 16.9 million yuan in 1990, and it showed 
a sharp increase to 90.86 million yuan in 1991, and was 
increased again to 123.76 million yuan in 1992. Some grain 
depots spent as much as over 11.7 million yuan to purchase the 
materials, such as straw stripes, which could be used for 20 
years, thermometers, which could be used for 40 years, and wire 
rope, which would not be used up for 100 years, creating large 
stockpiles. There were also a great amount of fake and inferior 
goods among the materials. Some ratsbane was colored rice, some 
thermometers were empty glass tubes, and some straw mats and 
stripes were far below the standards to "look like cushions and 
belts" as the masses put it. Even goods like this were 
purchased at the prices several times, ten times, and even 
dozens of times higher. Wire ropes that costed four to 10 yuan 
per meter were purchased at the price ranging from 85 to 105 
yuan, earning lawless elements enough money to buy a Santana car 
after selling two bundles of wire ropes. Thermometers costed 
0.45 yuan each in the market, but they were purchased at 1.50 
yuan each. Ratsbane costing 10 yuan per 500 grams were purchased 
at 470 yuan. A report on the inventory of the property and 
capital of the grain departments of Changtu County showed that 
the county lost 68.22 million yuan in three years due to 
stockpiles of the materials, the high-priced low-quality 
materials, and the speculation in the purchases. However, some 
lawless elements earned their ill-gotten wealth totaling several 
hundred thousand yuan and even more than 1 million yuan. While 
they were spending freely the tremendous amount of money they 
appropriated from the state, some staff members and workers of 
grain depots faced the difficulty of overdue pay, and many 
peasants got only IOUs after a whole year's hard work. In view 
of this, many people reported the criminal activities of Gui 
Bingquan and other people in the past few years. 
  After the case was exposed, the vast number of cadres and 
the 
masses clapped and cheered. They voluntarily helped 
procuratorial organs investigate the case. There were a half 
sack of letters reporting the crimes. Punishment of corruption 
also rallied the efforts of the party and the people, making the 
county enjoy social stability and economic development. While 
investigating and handling the case, Tieling city party 
committee and government also summarized lessons. They made 
inventory of the property and capital of all the grain 
departments of the city to avoid new losses to the state. 
  This newspaper will publish relevant reports after the 
trials 
of the criminals to fully expose the details of the case and the 
process of cracking the case.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Qin Youshun (4440 0645 7311): "The 10 Million </F>
Yuan Worth State Shares Change Owners for the First Time"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 9 May, based on the legal 
supervision and intermediate service by the Anshan City Property 
Right Trading Market, the ownership of 10 million yuan worth 
state shares was transferred openly for the first time, and the 
transaction formalities were completed on the spot by the buying 
and selling sides. This means a major breakthrough made by 
Anshan city in reforming the system concerning the ownership of 
state-owned assets. 
  By the end of last year, Anshan set up a total of 18 limited 
liability stock companies whose shares were partly held by the 
state. Three of the companies raising capital stocks from the 
public and selling shares to the public were listed; and 15 
companies were raising capital stocks from fixed directions, 
with capital stocks totaling over 1 billion yuan, of which, 45 
percent was held by the state. Judging from the experiments, 
however, some problems remain in the fields of further changing 
the operating mechanism of enterprises on the basis of the 
shareholding system, enabling enterprises to assume 
responsibility for their own profits or losses, and enabling 
holders of the same amount of shares to enjoy the same rights 
and same profits. Conspicuous manifestation is that state 
shares cannot participate in market operation and cannot be 
circulated, thus being unfavorable to the activation of state 
capital and to the optimization of industrial structure. For 
this reason, Anshan city has mapped out programs on operation 
and management of state shares, has established property right 
exchange organs, and is preparing for the form of exchanging 
stocks behind the counter. The Anshan Automatic Control 
Instrument Group Limited Company and the Wuhuan Industrial 
Limited Company, side A of this stock transaction in Anshan, 
respectively transferred out 4 million and 6 million state 
shares (ordinary shares) valued at 4 million and 6 million yuan. 
Each share was sold at the ratio of 1 to 1.1 to side B, the 
Anshan City Trust and Investment Limited Company. The Anshan 
Automatic Control Instrument Group Limited Company and the 
Wuhuan Industrial Limited Company are share-holding enterprises 
with good management results and high social reputation in 
Anshan city. The former generated more than 10 million yuan in 
profits last year, with an increase margin of 105 percent, and 
the latter developed rapidly and drew more dividends in the past 
two years. The Anshan City Trust and Investment Limited Company 
is an enterprise gaining handsome profits through the stock 
market. Both buying and selling sides of this dealing are 
strong players in the stock market.

"Infrastructural Facilities of Dalian Industrial Zone Have Been 
Completed"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 18 May, more than 500 people, 
including the personages of all circles from Dalian Economic and 
Technical Development Zone and friends of all Japanese circles, 
gathered together at a piece of land where an upsurge in 
development has started in order to ceremoniously celebrate the 
successful completion of the infrastructural facilities of 
Dalian Industrial Zone, a major cooperation project that the 
governments, the peoples, and the industrial circles of both 
China and Japan have paid attention to. 
  Dalian Industrial Zone is the first project developed on a 
large scale by Japanese enterprises in China as well as the 
first project developed on a large scale with joint investment 
by Dalian and even China. This zone is developed with the 
investment jointly provided by China and Japan. A committee in 
charge of the development of Dalian Industrial Zone has been 
organized. This committee is composed of the managerial 
committee for Dalian Development Zone which stands for the 
Chinese side as well as 22 Japanese enterprises, including the 
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Itochu, Matsushita, Maruko, 
Kokyo Bank, and Tokyo Bank. The total investment in the 
jointly-funded development and management limited company of 
Dalian Industrial Zone is $65 million. The period for 
management of this company is 15 years. The right to 
utilization of 2.169 square kilometers of land for 50 years has 
been purchased from the management committee of Dalian 
Development Zone. 
  The construction of this zone started on October 19, 1992. 
So far, the infrastructural facilities of this zone have been 
completed. Simultaneously, 27 enterprises have formally been 
approved to enter the zone. Of them, seven started construction 
and two formally went into operation. A group of large 
enterprises of world fame with high technological levels and 
first-grade management levels, such as Shanwu [name as 
transliterated], Huoniweier [name as transliterated], Fuji 
Electronics and Machinery Company, Konica, Luomu [name as 
transliterated], and Baoshazao [name transliterated], have 
entered the zone in advance. The enterprises that will be 
introduced to the zone this year are expected to use 
approximately 60 percent of the total development areas. Some 
80 to 100 enterprises will be introduced to this zone. The 
total investment will surpass $600 million. 
  Li Tieling, member of the political bureau of the CPC 
Central 
Committee and state councillor, paid a special visit to Dalian 
to attend the ceremony for the completion of the infrastructural 
facilities. On behalf of the Chinese government, he extended 
warm greetings to the achievements made through the cooperation 
of China and Japan and expressed cordial regards to the 
construction workers of both sides. He said: China and Japan 
should make greater headway in economic, trade, and 
technological cooperation. In the course of building Dalian 
Development Zone, the friends of all circles of Japan have 
constantly given us understanding and assistance. He hoped that 
both the Chinese and Japanese sides would further make efforts 
hand in hand, introduce high-quality projects, and make Dalian 
Industrial Zone become an example in large-scale development 
through Sino-foreign cooperation. 
  Present at the ceremony were personages of all circles in 
Japan, including Niwaki Kentaro, vice minister in charge of 
political affairs under the Ministry of Finance in Japan; 
Xiaoyuan Yutian [name as transliterated], consul of Dalian 
office under the Consulate General of Japan in Shenyang; and 
Hayashi Akirahiko, director of the Overseas Economic Cooperation 
Fund. 
  Also present at the ceremony were Sun Pinghua, president of 
the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association; Wang Shiyuan, vice 
chairman of the Economic Restructuring Committee under the State 
Council; Zhao Yundong, deputy director of the special economic 
zones office; Wen Shizhen and Gao Guozhu, vice governors of the 
Liaoning Provincial government; and responsible comrades of the 
provincial departments, commissions, and offices. Takeshita 
Noboru, former prime minister of Japan, sent a message of 
congratulation on the completion of the infrastructural 
facilities of the project.

  [Text] Shenyang, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Dandong, China's 
biggest border city, achieved a turnover of 17.34 million U.S. 
dollars in border trade from January to April this year, up 93 
percent over the same period in 1993. 
  Located in northeast China's Liaoning Province, on the 
northernmost part of the country's coastline, the city is 
separated from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by a 
river. 
  In its trade with Korea, Dandong exports grain, beef, meat, 
textile goods, household electrical appliances and light 
industry products, and imports steel, timber and aquatic 
products. 
  The city now has more than 170 companies doing business with 
Korean partners. 
  During recent trade talks in Pyongyang, the city's 
representatives signed 11.9 million U.S. dollars-worth of 
contracts for imports and exports with their Korean opposite 
numbers. 
  This year, the city has issued a set of measures to 
encourage 
the border trade. 
  Dandong was included in the opening up coastal area in 1988 
and became a government-approved border trade zone in 1992.

  [Text] Shenyang, May 31 (XINHUA) -- More than 2.3 million 
rural people lived in poverty-stricken areas in northeast 
China's Liaoning province are now able to earn more than 500 
yuan a year, the provincial poverty line, after eight years of 
efforts by the government. 
  A relatively well-off province in China, Liaoning is quite 
imbalanced in its regional development and there were 3.6 
million people living below the poverty line in 1986. 
  Under the government's preferential policies, adopted since 
1986, areas in the eastern, western and northern parts of the 
province have been offered loans of more than 550 million yuan 
for upgrading and restructuring the local farming industry, 
enterprises and commercial sectors. 
  Preliminary success has been achieved. The aided projects 
have created tax-yields and profits of 330 million yuan and 
benefited some 700,000 families in the past eight years. 
  In addition, public facilities and infrastructure facilities 
have been improved: 49 highways -- 1,800 kilometers in all -- 
and more than 100 new bridges were constructed. New irrigation 
channels and wells were upgraded. Drinking water problems for 
more than 1.24 million people and 260,000 head of livestock in 
these areas have been solved.

"Perspective on Guangdong's Hot Spots in 1994: Guangdong 
Seriously Deals With `Swollen Investment'"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 18 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- 
Guangdong is the area where the economy has developed the most 
rapidly in China, and it is also a major province with a 
considerable amount of investment. Guangdong's annual 
investment in fixed assets currently accounts for approximately 
one-tenth of the country's total. Today, at a time when 
macroeconomic regulation and control are being intensified, 
whether Guangdong is able to effectively reduce its investment 
has become a central issue in the course of economic development 
this year. 
  Over the past two years, Guangdong has witnessed the most 
heated economy since the beginning of reform and opening up in 
the province, and the scope of investment has swollen rapidly. 
In 1992, the province's investment in fixed assets exceeded 70 
billion yuan, accounting for approximately one-tenth of the 
country's total of more than 750 billion yuan. This represented 
an increase of 92 percent, which was 54 percentage points higher 
than the national average. Last year, affected by macroeconomic 
regulation and control, investment was reduced to a certain 
extent, but investment in fixed assets was still booming and 
exceeded 146 billion yuan during the entire year, representing 
an increase of 58 percent over 1992. 
  The drastic expansion of the scale of investment has 
injected 
vitality into Guangdong's economy and has played an 
indispensable supporting role in rapid economic operations. 
Experts here maintain that the approximate 20 percent economic 
growth rate in Guangdong last year was obviously due to the 
substantial increase in investment there. 
  Last year, the province accelerated its construction of 
infrastructure facilities with the aid of sharp increases in 
investment. A total of 26 key projects with an investment 
amount of over 1 billion yuan each were established, and quite a 
few infrastructure facilities were completed and put into 
production, laying down the foundation for rapid economic 
development. 
  However, the growth of investment in fixed assets at a 
super-rapid speed for two consecutive years has also given rise 
to the problem of "swollen investment," which has had the 
following negative impacts: 1) The funding shortage has meant 
that funds have not been available for a number of construction 
projects and have affected the macroeconomic results of 
investments, 2) The sky-rocketing prices of building materials 
-- that of plate glass has practically doubled -- have 
constituted an inflationary pressure. 
  According to statistics, the total amount of investment 
projects under construction in Guangdong during the past two 
years exceeded 370 billion yuan. 
  A number of major reform measures will be introduced this 
year. Guangdong has proposed to properly handle the 
relationships between reform, stability, and development and to 
strengthen its control over the scale of investment in fixed 
assets. As has been revealed, a set of regulations on managing 
investment in fixed assets is currently being drafted. This 
indicates that Guangdong has given consideration to fixed assets 
investment on a long-term basis. 
  Guangdong has adopted six measures to reduce investment in 
fixed assets this year. One one hand, it has done what it could 
to ensure the funds required by the key projects, and, on the 
other, it has strictly implemented an investment licensing 
system to control the initiation of projects. 
  Judging from the first quarter of this year, investment in 
fixed assets has been brought under control. The investment of 
2.9 billion yuan in 33 key construction projects has been 
fulfilled with good progress, and investment in fixed assets 
amounting to 16.3 billion yuan has also been fulfilled. This 
represents an increase of 51 percent, which is lower than that 
of the corresponding period last year. 
  As predicted by specialists, the growth of investment in 
fixed assets will be more appropriately controlled within 40 
percent in Guangdong this year. 
  Nevertheless, Guangdong is still faced with quite a few 
thorny problems in controlling investment in fixed assets: 
First, the task will be difficult and the road will be long as 
the province tries to reduce the investment scale of state-owned 
enterprises. Last year, in the multiple economic sectors, 
investment of state-owned enterprises in fixed assets increased 
by the largest margin, reaching 71 percent. Due to the 
transformation of operational mechanisms, enterprises now 
possess more decisionmaking powers and have the right to define 
the orientation of investment, and this will certainly give rise 
to the issue of unnatural expansion in investment. Solving this 
issue is particularly difficult for the government. Second, 
investment projects under construction last year involving more 
than 200 million yuan will be transferred to this year, and this 
will make controlling the overall scale of investments for this 
year considerably difficult.

  [Text] According to statistics provided by the provincial 
Statistical Bureau, our province's economic operation has been 
stable as a whole, and the results of strengthening and 
improving macroscopic regulation and control have been further 
demonstrated. During the first four months this year, the value 
of industrial sales reached 115.9 billion yuan, an increase of 
19.2 percent over the same period last year. The accumulated 
total volume of retail sales of consumer goods was 51.9 billion 
yuan, up 32.5 percent over the corresponding period last year. 
  Under the stable situation of production and circulation, 
some problems that had arisen in economic operation have been 
mitigated. First, the margin of increase in investment in fixed 
assets has continued to be narrowed. Second, the bottleneck 
constraint has been lessened, as the rail freight volume and 
generated energy of the whole province have exceeded industrial 
growth in the corresponding period last year. Third, the 
financial situation has been basically normal. Fourth, the 
momentum of commodity price increases has been curtailed.

  [Text] The Shenzhen government has embarked on a 
collision course with the central Chinese government by claiming 
it will not change the 20 per cent fee it charges developers on 
the profits on the sale of a property. 
  During a recent Shenzhen property exhibition at the China 
Resources Exhibition Hall, lawyer Zhang Zhuan Jiang of the 
Shenzhen Land Planning Bureau said his government had sent a 
report to the central government telling it "of our intent to 
retain the current 20 percent policy". 
  The central government has announced plans to implement a 
Land Appreciation Tax (LAT) on the profits of developers and 
property investors. However, the government has not yet 
announced how the tax will be implemented or how much it would 
allow developers to make before implementing the tax. Mr Zhang 
said irrespective of details of the LAT, Shenzhen would argue 
"it was a special case" and need not necessarily abide by the 
LAT. 
  He said Shenzhen authorities had emphasised to the central 
government that their 20 per cent fee had been in place since 
1988 and they must "ensure the continuity of their policy". 
  Mr Zhang said Shenzhen officials believed that since 
investors and developers took a lot of risks in building their 
projects, they should be guaranteed a certain amount of profit 
before implementing the LAT. "So, the 20 per cent profit is 
reasonable," he said. 
  The Shenzhen lawyer said he hoped the local government would 
be provided with "sufficient leeway" in implementing details of 
the tax and that it would be allowed to be flexible in applying 
the tax. 
  Mr Zhang said the LAT had not deterred developers in 
Shenzhen. 
  "Before, we had four levels of tax. This one tax is less 
than before. So, the 20 per cent fee has not had a negative 
impact on development," he said. 
  According to one Shenzhen official, property development is 
the single biggest industry in the economic development zone.

  [Text] Haikou, May 31 (CNS) -- The Haikou Intermediate 
People's Court began to try a case this morning in which the 
former deputy secretary-general of the Hainan provincial 
government Li Shanyou was charged with committing frame-up and 
accepting bribes. 
  The defendant, a native of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, was 
former deputy secretary-general of the provincial government, 
deputy director of the Hainan Securities Supervision Commission 
and deputy head of a leading team of the reform of the 
shareholding practice. He was accused of collecting false 
information on conduct of the former governor known by his 
surname as Liu since 1992. He later incited a person to forge 
evidence to frame the former governor. The fabrication was 
finally uncovered, and Li was arrested in August last year on a 
charge of frame-up. During the interrogation, Li admitted that 
he had accepted shares and cash worth a total of RMB510,000 
[renminbi] from three shareholding companies as bribes during 
his tenure as the deputy director of the securities commission. 
The Haikou People's Procuratorate lodged prosecution against 
him on charges of frame-up and bribe taking with the 
intermediate court on May 16. 
  During the public trial today Li confessed to all charges 
against him, and a verdict will soon be passed on the defendant 
by the court.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Russia, which maintains 
full diplomatic links with Mainland China, will open a 
representative office in Taipei before the end of this fall, 
[passage indistinct] the Moscow-Taipei Economic and Cultural 
Coordination Commission said here Tuesday [31 May]. 
  "The representative office is expected to be inaugurated 
very 
soon," Aleksey B. Remizov said. "We've discovered a suitable 
office here in Taipei." 
  The commission is authorised to handle private exchange 
[words indistinct] Russia and Taiwan in the absence of official 
diplomatic ties. 
  Initially, the representative office will not be authorized 
to issue visas directly to Taiwan citizens wanting to visit 
Russia. All the visa applications it receives here will be 
forwarded to Russia's consulate in Hong Kong for approval, 
according to Remizov. 
  The office will have approximately eight employee, with half 
of them locals, Remizov said. 
  There was earlier talk of setting up the long-awaited 
representative office, but none of the reports turned out to be 
true due to financial difficulties. "The budget to finance the 
establishment of the office was approved about a month ago," an 
elated Remizov said. 
  Remizov, who arrived here last Friday and will stay here for 
three weeks is concurrently the president of the privately 
funded Scientific-Technical Center [word indistinct] in Russia. 
  In addition to helping tackle the problems facing the new 
representative office, Remizov admitted he is also here to sign 
a contract worth US$3 million with Acer Inc., Acton Technology 
and Zyxel for the purchase of computer equipment, which will be 
used by a Russian governmental organization. 
  He is optimistic about bilateral economic ties. Two-way 
trade between the two countries hit a record US$450 million in 
1992, and that's doubled to US$900 million in 1993. The figure 
is anticipated to top US$1 billion this year. 
  Still, he was reluctant to cover the slow progress on the 
other spectrum of bilateral ties, repeatedly stressing that 
Nikolai I. Ryzkov, the former prime minister of the Soviet 
Union, was visiting Taipei to handle that aspect of the 
relationship. 
  Remizov also ruled out the possibility of any arms deals 
between Taipei and Moscow, apparently for fear of affecting ties 
with Beijing. "The export of weapons from Russia is under tight 
control," he emphasized.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- The Republic of China will 
not interfere in the political operations of Hong Kong even 
though it has been a firm supporter of democratic development in 
the British colony, President Li Teng-hui said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Li made the remarks while meeting a group of Hong Kong media 
representatives at the presidential office. 
  He said the government has been very concerned about the 
lives and well-being of Chinese in Hong Kong, and said 
regulations are now being drafted governing relations with Hong 
Kong, as well as Macao, to safeguard the rights and interests of 
the two colonies' residents after they revert to mainland rule 
in 1997 and 1999, respectively. 
  Turning to cross-strait relations, Li said Hong Kong has and 
will continue to have an important role to play. He said that 
instead of seeking detente with the mainland, as it has done in 
the past, Taipei in the future wilt try to push ahead with 
peaceful and positive exchanges with the mainland. 
  He said people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should 
increase their mutual trust to build a foundation for national 
unification, but that the world should also understand that 
China is now divided and under separate rule. 
  He rejected Beijing's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, 
saying that from a historical point of view, Tokyo returned 
Taiwan and Penghu to the ROC in the peace treaty it signed with 
Taipei in 1952. 
  "The Chinese Communists have never taken a step on Taiwan, 
nor have they collected a penny of tax from people on the 
island, so how can they justify their sovereignty claim over 
Taiwan?" Li asked. 
  He said the reason he called mainland officials "a bunch of 
bandits" after the March 31 Lake Qiandao disaster, in which 24 
Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and crew were robbed 
and murdered, was because they had in the beginning tried to 
avoid taking responsibility for the incident.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan has emerged as the 
world's fifth largest information product manufacturer, behind 
the United States, Japan, Britain and Singapore, trade sources 
said Wednesday [1 June]. 
  Moreover, Taiwan tops the world in production of five kinds 
of computer hardware, including motherboards, mice, scanners, 
monitors and keyboards. 
  The semi-official China External Trade Development Council 
(CETRA) said Taiwan's computer hardware and software production 
amounted to US$10.8 billion in 1993. If hardware manufactured 
by overseas Taiwan-owned companies was included, total output 
reached US$12.5 billion. 
  CETRA officials said Taiwan produced 83 percent of the 
world's motherboards last year, 80 percent of all mice, 55 
percent of all scanners, 51 percent of monitors and 49 percent 
of keyboards. 
  Taiwan's information industry grew fastest between 1983 and 
1987, the officials said. During that period, annual exports of 
information products rose by an average of 60 percent. 
  The export growth rate has, however, slowed since 1988 due 
to 
a worldwide economic recession, the appreciation of the new 
Taiwan dollar, rising domestic labor costs and an exodus of 
keyboard and mouse manufacturers. 
  Nevertheless, the officials said, prospects for the local 
information industry remain good because Taiwan has an abundant 
supply of computer scientists and software developers. They 
predicted that the annual growth rate of Taiwan's information 
product exports will still reach 15 percent in the years ahead.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The Hualon Group is 
unlikely to reverse its plan to open a textile mill in Northern 
Ireland due to opposition from some European textile makers, the 
group's founder T. M. Weng said Wednesday [1 June]. 
  Weng, a legislator, noted that the investment project in 
suburban Belfast, which calls for a total investment of 157 
million British pounds (US$235.5 million), has already been 
fixed. 
  Britain, which has offered various financial incentives to 
lure foreign companies to make investment, "invited" Hualon to 
establish such a mill, he stressed. 
  Hualon is scheduled to enter into an investment subsidy 
agreement with the British Government on June 9, which was 
approved by the Executive Commission of the European Union (EU) 
in early May, he elaborated. 
  Under the agreement, he said, the London government will 
provide 61 million British pounds (US$91.5 million) in subsidies 
to the Hualon project. 
  The textile mill is expected to create 1,800 jobs in 
Northern 
Ireland, where unemployment reaches as high as 15 percent. 
  Weng made the remarks in reaction to news reports that 
European textile manufacturers are prepared to bring a complaint 
against Hualon, 
  The dissatisfaction with Hualon might stem from Hualon's 
strong competitiveness, Weng said, noting the combined 
production of its mills in Taiwan and Malaysia has made Hualon 
the world's largest man-made fiber producer. 
  He pointed out that the Northern Ireland investment plan was 
made by the Hualon Corp., a key affiliate of the group. The 
company is chaired by his younger brother Weng Yiu-ming. 
  Meanwhile, a CNA dispatch from London said that the 
London-based FINANCIAL TIMES Tuesday reported on the 
controversies surrounding the Hualon project. 
  The EU Executive Commission gave the green light to the 
Hualon investment plan after intensive lobbying by British 
officials and parliamentarians, the dispatch quoted the paper as 
reporting. 
  The paper also revealed that the two Weng brothers have been 
charged with breach of contract in Taiwan, which the CNA 
dispatch said has hurt Hualon's reputation.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan's tourism revenues 
reached US$695 million in the first quarter of this year, the 
highest quarterly figure for the past five years, the Central 
Bank of China (CBC) reported Wednesday [1 June]. 
  During the same period, overseas travel spending amounted to 
US$1.82 billion, according to CBC statistics. 
  As a result, Taiwan still incurred a tourism deficit of 
US$1.13 billion during the January-March period. 
  Taiwan's overseas travel bills have increased rapidly in 
recent years as more people go abroad for sightseeing and 
shopping. Government tallies show Taiwan residents spent US$7.6 
billion on overseas pleasure trips in 1993, nearly equal to 
Taiwan's total foreign trade surplus of US$7.85 billion for the 
year. 
  Meanwhile, the Tourism Bureau reported that the occupancy 
rate at local tourist hotels reached 58.15 percent in the first 
quarter of this year, up 6.69 percent from the year-earlier 
level. 
  Tourist arrivals hit a high of 525,000 during the 
three-month 
period, an increase of 19 percent from the year before, the 
bureau said. 
  It attributed the rise partly to a new government measure to 
allow 120-hour visa-free stays for visitors from the United 
States, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Austria, Holland, 
Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- A number of scholars 
Tuesday [31 May] blasted Taiwan Power Company's [Taipower] 
decision to increase the generating capacity of the proposed 
fourth nuclear power plant as "irresponsibly against the law." 
  At a hearing hosted by Kuomintang legislator Wang 
Shih-hsiung, Prof. Kao Cheng-yen of National Taiwan University 
said that Taipower's decision to increase the generating 
capacity of the King- liao plant from the originally proposed 1 
million kilowatts to 1.3 million kilowatts without notifying the 
government and the public was a violation of the law that allows 
the building and budgeting of only a 1 million-kilowatt nuclear 
facility. 
  Prof. Wang Tu-fa of National Chunghsing University added 
that 
Taipower failed to present an environmental-impact assessment 
before it decided to enlarge the plant's generating capacity. 
[word indistinct] Yung-jen, an official with the Department of 
Health, said an environmental-impact assessment report is vital 
because the 1 million kilowatt plant will increase the 
temperature of seawater near the Kung-liao plant by only 2.8 
degrees centigrade, but if the generating capacity of the plant 
is increased to 1.3 million kilowatts, the seawater temperature 
will rise by 3.16 degrees, which he said would be a costly blow 
to the coastal area's ecological system. 
  The greater generating capacity would also mean larger 
governmental expenditures and greater social costs, Ko 
Cheng-yen, the vice chairman of the Taiwan Environmental 
Protection Union, said. 
  In response to the criticism, Taipower Chairman Chang 
Chung-chien said the 1.3 million-kilowatt reactor is less prone 
to accidents than the 1 million-kilowatt reactor, and produces a 
lower level of radiation and less nuclear waste. 
  Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien, who was also 
present 
at the hearing, disagreed that Taipower's increased capacity 
plan is illegal, saying that the original proposal for the 
fourth nuclear power plant had a capacity "ranging from 900,000 
kilowatts to 1.35- million kilowatts.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan registered a US$1.67 
billion surplus in its balance of payments in the first quarter 
of this year, the most favorable quarterly balance since 1992, 
the Central Bank of China (CBC) said Wednesday [1 June]. 
  CBC officials attributed the surplus to increased capital 
inflow. Taiwan saw a net capital inflow of US$1.76 billion 
during the January-March period. It was the first time the 
country's capital account ended in the black since 1988. 
  The balance of payments is a system recording all of a 
country's economic transactions with the rest of the world 
during a specified period of time. It is usually divided into 
the capital account, which records short and long-term capital 
flow, and the current account, which records merchandise and 
service trade as well as unrequited money transfers. 
  In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan's current account 
surplus declined to a 13-year low of US$272 million due to a 
sharp decrease in the merchandise trade surplus. 
  Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only US$240 million 
during the January-March period because of sluggish exports and 
a continued rise in imports. 
  The aggregate capital and current account surplus should be 
US$2.03 billion in the first quarter of this year. Excluding 
net errors and omissions, the CBC put the country's balance of 
payments surplus at US$1.67 billion.

  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Makung Airlines will start 
servicing a Kaohsiung-Laoag-Xiamen flight in June, offering 
Taiwan travelers a cheaper and shorter route to Mainland China 
than via Hong Kong. 
  Laoag is a city in the northern Philippines. Xiamen is in 
coastal southern Mainland China. 
  "It will take about two hours and NT [new Taiwan] $11,000 
(US$407) to travel from Kaohsiung to Xiamen via the 
Philippines," said Makung's Chairman, Chen Wen-wu. It costs at 
least NT$15,08, (US$555) and three to four hours to travel from 
Taiwan to the nearest spot in the mainland via Hong Kong. 
  "The new route will significantly benefit residents in 
southern Taiwan who previously have had to travel to Chiang 
Kai-Shek International Airport in northern Taiwan because of the 
shortage of seats for Kaohsiung-Hong Kong flights," Chen added. 
  Makung Airlines made the announcement that it would start 
servicing the route Tuesday [31 May] after the company was given 
permission by the government to conduct direct charter flights 
between Kaohsiung and Laoag. 
  After arriving in Laoag, Taiwan travelers will be flown on 
the same flight to Manila, there they will then board South 
China Airline planes to Xiamen. 
  Makung will service the Kaohsiung-Laoag route with a Boeing 
757 recently leased from the United States, while South China 
Airlines is planning to offer a Boeing 737 service for the 
Manila-Xiamen flight, Chen explained.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
met here today with Peter Chiu, managing director of the Hong 
Kong Health Food Enterprise Company, and his wife Cheung Yeuk 
Lee. 
  Chiu and his wife made the trip to donate six million yuan 
to 
build 100 primary schools in poor regions on the mainland. 
  Li spoke highly of the action and said that people around 
the 
country were paying great attention to education, one of the 
most important and outstanding problems in China now. 
  In recent years, Li said, many patriotic overseas Chinese 
and 
compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao have donated large amounts of 
money to help build schools in poor areas. The donors should be 
praised, he added. 
  He also expressed his hope that relevant departments on the 
mainland cooperate closely with donors and apply their donations 
to yield effective results. For instance, with support of the 
United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee, Taiwan entrepreneur Kander Lee's donation has 
achieved real results in development of education, he said. 
  The 100 schools underwritten by the couple, under 
arrangements by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, are expected to be finished 
by the end of 1995. 
  Part of the donation will be used to construct "Chunlei 
Primary Schools", sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation 
exclusively for girl dropouts.

  [Text] Lu Ping, the director of Beijing's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, last night signalled China's willingness 
to make progress on the much-delayed talks over the building of 
the territory's ninth container terminal and the new airport. 
Lu's remarks indicate a significant gesture by China to improve 
the atmosphere surrounding talks on economic matters. However, 
Lu's seeming desire for progress in talks has in the past been 
followed by serious backtracking. 
  Lu told a Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce delegation in 
Beijing 
that the issue of Container Terminal 9 (CT9) should be 
approached "from the commercial perspective" rather than "mixing 
it up with political factors." Lu said, however, that China 
could not proceed to discussions with the British side before 
the Hong Kong Government had finalised arrangements with 
developers. He said that "economic rules", rather than 
"political trading" should be the guideline for building CT9. 
  Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, last night welcomed Lu's 
remarks. "We accept Lu's comment with delight but the 
government has never mixed the CT9 issue with any political 
factors. The government is now discussing development rights 
with consortia," she said, adding Hong Kong hoped to settle the 
matter as soon as possible as container terminals were very busy. 
  Lu also said Beijing "genuinely wished" to maintain its 
cooperation with Britain in other areas, citing the progress 
made during the latest talks on the financial arrangements for 
the new airport project. Both sides had agreed to discuss the 
Airport Corporation Bill and hoped to reach a general agreement 
on financial arrangements. 
  John Meredith, managing director of Hong Kong International 
Terminals (HIT), has said that construction costs have increased 
by about 20 percent as a result of the lengthy delay. 
  Interested developers include a consortium formed by Modern 
Terminals Ltd (MTL), HIT, the state-owned China Ocean Shipping 
Corporation, and the Jardine Pacific-led Tsing Yi Container 
Terminal group. 
  Turning to other matters, Lu called for an increase in the 
number of meetings of experts from both sides under the Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG). He urged the speeding up of work on 
localizing Hong Kong's laws, only some of which could be left 
until after 1997. He invited Hong Kong's "business friends" to 
suggest which laws had to be adapted and approved (by the JLG) 
as soon as possible. 
  On the issue of permanent right of abode for returning Hong 
Kong emigrants, Lu said China welcomed Hong Kong returnees. He 
promised that China would formulate a "lenient policy" and "more 
simple approaches" to enable them to continue to live and work 
in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Waiting for Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] Business leaders were so confident that President 
Bill Clinton would renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) 
status, that its reaction yesterday was almost dismissively 
blase. Yet the territory has reason to be thankful Mr Clinton 
was prepared to brave the domestic fall-out from his U-turn for 
the sake of the larger economic and geostrategic advantages of 
continued "engagement" with China. 
  The President said there were 150,000 American jobs at stake 
supporting trade with China. Hong Kong's far smaller economy 
stood to lose at least 75,000 jobs -- the rough equivalent in 
U.S. terms to putting two million out of work and an immediate 
loss of earnings equivalent to more than four per cent of its 
Gross Domestic Product. In the longer term, there would have 
been some reinvestment in manufacturing here, as industrialists 
pulled out of China, but the overall picture would have been 
even bleaker. Hong Kong's economic lifeblood comes from its 
role as a trade, services and finance hub for China. Remove 
that role, and it loses its engine of growth and prosperity and 
the importance to the industrialised world that has kept it in 
the international eye for so long. 
  Realistically, the separation of trade and human rights 
which 
MFN renewal represents means Hong Kong could hope for little 
material support from the West if future Chinese rule proved 
oppressive. Yet revocation of MFN would have set Hong Kong on 
the way to economic and political irrelevance. If that 
happened, support from the U.S. would be equally limited. 
  But if Hong Kong has something to be thankful for, many will 
also join human rights campaigners in expressing scepticism at 
Mr Clinton's commitment to using engagement to lay the basis for 
what he called "long-term sustainable progress in human rights 
and ... the advancement of (America's) other interests with 
China". 
  The programme he spelled out -- maintaining the 
post-Tiananmen sanctions; banning the import of guns and 
munitions from China; increasing Radio Free Asia [as published] 
and Voice of America broadcasts; and boosting support for 
non-governmental human rights bodies -- falls far short of the 
comprehensive diplomatic engagement he promised. He made no 
mention of a human rights commission, whether bilateral or 
unilateral, to monitor Chinese abuses and bring them to the 
attention of the authorities. He was vague about the kind of 
dialogue with Beijing leaders that would be effective in 
boosting human rights. 
  It would be sensible to wait before announcing such measures 
to consult China and to try to involve it in working out the 
detail, rather than engaging in counter-productive megaphone 
diplomacy. But Mr Clinton cannot expect to continue 
indefinitely without a discernible programme of engagement on 
human rights issues. Separating human rights and MFN should not 
mean abandoning all commitment to bolstering human liberties 
under what remains a repressive regime.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`One Country, Two Systems' Must Not Be </F>
Undermined"] 
  [Text] When delivering a speech in Hong Kong in early May, 
Lu Ping pointed out: "It was on the basis of Hong Kong's 
economic value that China drew up the current policy on Hong 
Kong" and "there are always a handful of people who naively 
believe that they can turn Hong Kong into a political city which 
can influence the mainland politically." Lu Ping's remark met 
with the approval of former Hong Kong Governor Maclehose, who 
thought Lu Ping's speech deserved due attention from the people 
of Hong Kong. 
  Former British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe also made a 
speech in late May. He pointed out that it is not sensible for 
anybody to try using Hong Kong as a "bridgehead" for changing 
the mainland, as this might spell destruction for Hong Kong. If 
Hong Kong wishes its existing system and lifestyle to be 
preserved without intervention from the mainland, Hong Kong 
should not be used as a "bridgehead" in any attempt to change 
the mainland. We should respect China's idea of not wanting to 
be changed or challenged by Hong Kong. 
  Anson Chan also pointed out on 26 May: "Outsiders come to 
Hong Kong, trying to use Hong Kong as a base to carry out 
subversive activities or interfere in China's internal affairs. 
Naturally, we citizens of Hong Kong do not wish them to use 
Hong Kong as such a base." 
  Why were these remarks made? Because one foreign country at 
one time took in a batch of so-called "pro-democracy activists" 
who attempted to subvert the Chinese Government, providing them, 
in addition to food and clothing, with "political asylum." 
These people are indeed very "free" and carefree and have even 
managed to move their families abroad, but their bosses do not 
want them to stay idle and tell them to return to the mainland 
to carry out subversive activities against the Chinese 
Government. Han Dongfang's claiming that he would return to the 
mainland to organize a solidarity trade union [as published] was 
obviously to make trouble out of nothing. Who remitted money to 
Han Dongfang to make sure that he had enough to eat and could 
carry out anti-China activities? It was none other than the 
American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial 
Organizations [AFL-CIO], the anticommunist organization which 
has been a staunch advocate of economic sanctions against China. 
Han Dongfang's recent providers have been the members of the 
Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in 
China [ASPDMC]. 
  The mainland's political situation is stable at present, but 
some people, relying on the backing of foreign countries, are 
running counter to the keen wish of the 1.1 billion Chinese 
people to concentrate on economic construction and improving 
their livelihood in an environment of stability and unity. They 
want to change the mainland's current situation and its system. 
Following in Han Dongfang's footsteps, they vie with each other 
to get to Hong Kong and put on a "show" first, before moving on 
into the mainland via the springboard of Hong Kong to make 
trouble. The purpose of such people as Wuer Kaixi, Liu Binyan, 
and Ruan Mingzhi [7086 6900 0037] in coming to Hong Kong is none 
other than to join the ASPDMC, fan the flames of disorder, and 
"put out feelers" before returning to the mainland to make 
trouble. They want, first of all, to sound out the political 
climate in Hong Kong; second, to elicit a response from the 
mainland with Hong Kong as the bridgehead; and third, to try to 
drag out their stay in Hong Kong, just like Han Dongfang. 
  The purpose of their transferring the base for challenging 
and confronting the mainland to Hong Kong is obviously to drag 
Hong Kong into the political whirlpool; undermine the 
relationship of harmonious coexistence between Hong Kong and the 
mainland; and therefore damage the prosperity, stability, and 
smooth transition of Hong Kong and change the orientation of 
"one country, two systems." 
  The feasibility of "one country, two systems" is subject to 
the prerequisite that the system of socialism is not interfered 
with, subverted, or sabotaged and that Hong Kong's economic 
development is conducive to socialist construction. This is 
where the value of a capitalist Hong Kong lies. If some people 
attempt to change the system of socialism using the system of 
capitalism, they are bound to cause clashes and confrontation 
between Hong Kong and the mainland, which would spell disaster 
to Hong Kong. The implication of Hong Kong's being an economic 
city is that it plays a positive role in the development of the 
Chinese economy. If Hong Kong becomes a political city and is 
used by some people as a base for changing the mainland's 
political system, the mainland will certainly consider 
responding to the act of one system interfering in another. 
  The wish of the 6 million Hong Kong people is that the 
mainland system will not change the system in Hong Kong. This 
wish has been respected by the mainland, which set it down in 
Annex 1 of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. But the 
mainland's wish is that Hong Kong should also respect the system 
of the mainland and not attempt to change it. Jiang Zemin 
delivered a well-known speech on "well water not mixing with 
river water." Is it not very unfair if Hong Kong does not 
respect the wish of the mainland and yet hopes that the mainland 
will respect the wish of the Hong Kong people? 
  Respect is mutual. Only when two systems respect each other 
can one country, two systems be implemented. If one system does 
not respect the other system and tries to bring it down, the 
implementation of "one country, two systems" will suffer. The 
ASPDMC's recent statement of its position indicates that they 
are impenetrably thick-headed. They still want to use Hong Kong 
as a base to carry on with the confrontation. This is like 
playing with fire that will make Hong Kong and the people of 
Hong Kong suffer.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] The management of ATV yesterday backed down from 
its refusal to screen a documentary on the Beijing massacre, 
after journalists resigned over the station's self-censorship. 
Executives pledged to "return" to the News and Public Affairs 
Department the power to decide whether the film would be shown 
as planned on Saturday night, the fifth anniversary of the 
military crushing of the pro-democracy movement. Chief 
Executive Officer Mark Lee Po-on told the journalists who had 
resigned that the news team were to "have the final say" on the 
matter. 
  But the six -- all holding key positions in the department 
-- 
have yet to decide whether to withdraw their resignations. They 
will meet the management again today to discuss questions 
related to the independence of the News Division. Deputy Chief 
Executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who has overall control of 
the News Division, will probably be absent from the meeting. Mr 
Chang flew to Taiwan on a business trip on Monday afternoon. 
His announcement last Friday morning that the film should not 
be screened triggered an outcry within and outside the station 
about media self-censorship in matters sensitive to China. 
  The 40-minute Spanish production contains about seven 
minutes 
of footage of the situation in Tiananmen Square between 4 am and 
7 am on June 4, 1989. The film, shot from the Monument to the 
People's Heroes, is the first visual record to show what 
happened in the square during the three-hour news ban. It 
supports the long-held version from Chinese officials that there 
was no killing in the square. 
  The management reportedly was of the view that there was 
nothing special in the film, and that it failed to show the 
"overall situation" in Tiananmen Square. They also apparently 
held that it would do no good to Hong Kong to discuss the issue 
again. Yesterday, however, the management insisted the incident 
in the newsroom had arisen from communication problems. 
  Mr Lee said the management and the News Division had 
different views on when the Spanish production should be 
scheduled. The News Division intended to screen it on the 
current affairs programme News Magazine while the management 
preferred it be shown in One Day, a programme looking back at 
historical events. "Management has now decided to let the News 
Division have the final say in this matter, by leaving it to 
those in charge of the programme to decide when and how it 
should best be presented," Mr Lee said. 
  Assistant Controller of ATV's Public Relations and Publicity 
Department Lu Fung claimed that it was the management's 
intention to preserve the independence of the News Division. 
She insisted that the company had still been in the course of 
discussion with the journalists regarding the programme when the 
resignations were submitted. It had been decided to"return to 
the department the rights of decision", she said. But Ms Lu did 
not explain why a promotional segment of the programme had been 
withheld late last Thursday. 
  Assistant News Controller Selina Li Yuk-lin, one of those 
who 
resigned on Monday, rejected the management's explanation that 
the whole incident was due to a misunderstanding. "My 
understanding is that at one point, a decision was made to ban 
the programme," she said. Executive editor Lo Wing-hung said Mr 
Chang had told the news team that the management would not 
change its mind, despite the resignations. The management 
offered the alternative screening in One Day only on Monday, 
after she and Acting News Controller Poon Fu-yin indicated they 
would resign, Ms Li said. "But the point is that it should be 
up to us to decide when and how to screen programmes," she said. 
  Mr Poon said the news team would stick to the original plan 
and run the programme at 10.30 on Saturday night, almost the 
exact time the military began their crackdown five years ago. 
  The television station's initial decision to suspend the 
programme came under fire from a number of social groups. Ten 
people, including pro-democracy activist Lau Shan-ching, staged 
a protest at the ATV building in Broadcast Drive, Kowloon Tong. 
They shouted slogans to condemn ATV management for tampering 
with the freedom of the press. Spokesman for the Hong Kong 
Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in 
China, Cheung Man-kwong, also criticised the move. He said the 
screening would give a clearer picture of the situation in 
Tiananmen Square and should not be banned for commercial or 
administrative reasons.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The value of Hong 
Kong's total exports grew by 8.1 percent in the first four 
months of this year over the same period of last year, the 
Census and Statistics Department announced today. 
  Among the total, the value of re-exports rose by 13 percent, 
while that of domestic exports fell by 7.8 percent, according to 
external trade figures released by the department. 
  Supported largely by the continued expansion in Hong Kong's 
re-export trade, the value of imports showed an increase of 9.5 
percent. 
  These led to a visible trade deficit of 24.4 billion H.K. 
dollars (3.13 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months, 
equivalent to 6.8 percent of the value of imports during the 
period. 
  This compared with a deficit of 18.4 billion H.K. dollars 
(2.34 billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 5.6 percent of the 
value of imports, recorded in the same period of last year. 
  Commenting on the trade figures, a government spokesman said 
that the performance of re-exports was still quite robust, 
although the growth rate had moderated somewhat from last year. 
  The spokesman attributed the moderation mainly to slower 
growth in re-exports to the Chinese mainland, the United States 
and Germany.

  [Text] Mainland developers are "dumping" cheap property on 
to the Hong Kong market and many people are pouring their money 
into projects that will never get built, warned a top Guangzhou 
government official. Liu Xietan, deputy director of the 
Guangzhou Land Bureau, said a lot of mainland projects now being 
advertised in Hong Kong "could not be sold at such prices". 
  Local realtors are warning that investors stand to get badly 
burnt if they do not do their homework before buying flats on 
the mainland. Favoured locations for these property scams 
include those which have in the past proved popular for Hong 
Kong residents as investment havens. These include Zhuhai, 
Dongguan, Zhongshan and Panyu. 
  Not a day or night goes by that Hong Kong people are not 
bombarded with full-page print ads and splashy TV commercials 
featuring flats for sale in these locations. According to an 
agent at Hong Kong real estate agents Land Power, there can be 
as many as 30 property exhibitions on a given-weekend in Hong 
Kong. The asking price for many of these flats is ridiculously 
low -- $100,000 compared to the current asking price of $3 
million for an average flat in Hong Kong. Developers also offer 
between $20,000 and $50,000 worth of free household appliances 
to the purchaser. Financing terms are also enticing. The 
developers advertise no down payment an interest-free mortgage, 
no lawyer's fees and no management fees. 
  Hong Kong agents say they doubt developers can afford to 
sell 
the flats so cheaply. "It may be possible," said Allan Lee of 
Richard Ellis. "But it seems to us unrealistic for them to be 
able to earn a profit at these prices." He and other agents 
said that, at these prices, buyers could find themselves paying 
all sorts of extra fees in water, sewage and management fees. 
  But the same agents agree that the ads are enticing. "Many 
people in Hong Kong have relatives in these areas," said one 
agent. "These flats are big by Hong Kong standards (more than 
1,000 square feet) and they each have a balcony. "And maybe the 
$100,000 price tag has some kind of psychological impact," she 
said. 
  But agents said the most likely reason developers offered 
these flats so cheaply was because they were strapped for cash. 
"Ordinarily, they must get the money before they actually start 
construction," said the Land Power representative. Other agents 
said it was conceivable that a developer would sell one project 
to raise capital for a project already in financial trouble. To 
the consternation of the buyers, it is usually many months down 
the road when they find out that the developer has taken the, 
money and run. 
  They said the simple solution, was to find a reputable 
developer. But that was not as easy as it sounded. Most of 
these unscrupulous developers had received the required 
paperwork and licences from government officials giving them the 
go-ahead to develop and sell the property. Therefore, getting a 
look at their sales permits, pre-sale permits, construction 
permits and all the other documentation was usually not the 
problem. The documentation was valid, but maybe not the 
developer's resolve. 
  One realtor who asked for anonymity said: "This sort of 
problem occurs in the more remote areas. In the city centre, 
supervision is much tighter. But, in other areas, as long as 
you have good connections with the government officials they 
will give you the documentation. In most cases, the site is too 
far away for them to go and investigate and find out how much 
work is actually going on," he said. They just give the 
developer all the documentation he needs." But, in many 
instances the authorities never check the site. They just 
believed the developer and approved the licence.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- An agreement aimed at 
promoting and protecting mutual investment between Hong Kong and 
Sweden was signed here today. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, T.H. Chau, secretary for 
trade and industry, said that the agreement would further 
strengthen the excellent economic ties between the two areas. 
  According to Chau, the agreement provides investors from 
both 
sides with guarantees of fair treatment, the unrestricted right 
to transfer investments and returns, and proper compensation in 
the event of losses owing to expropriation. 
  The agreement, the fourth of its kind Hong Kong has signed, 
will enter into force 30 days after signature and remain 
effective for an initial period of 15 years.

  [Text] Macao, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The continuity of China's 
most favoured nation (MFN) trading status was not only 
beneficial to China's economic and trade development, but also 
good for Macao's economy. 
  Maria Gabriela dos Remedios Cesar, director of the Macao 
Government's economic department, was quoted by local newspapers 
as saying that the continuity of China's MFN status was a good 
news for businessmen and also was favourable for steady 
development of Sino-U.S. trade relations. 
  In another development, chairman of the Macao Export and 
Import Association Victor Ng said it was a sensible act of the 
U.S. Government to continue China's MFN status, for it is good 
for economic development of both sides. 
  He also said that it was a good thing that the U.S. 
Government has ever done to separate human rights from MFN 
issue. However, he added, it is hard to understand that the 
U.S. Government use munitions as a condition for continuity of 
China's MFN status.

<F P=106> ["New Talk" column: "United States Extends China's Most </F>
Favored Nation Status for Another Year"] 
  [Text] After a protracted effort, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has finally "turned around." He announced yesterday 
afternoon (0400 Asian time) the U.S. decision to extend China's 
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status for another year, going 
against the statement he made the same time last year that he 
might completely rescind China's MFN trading status next year. 
  In fact, Clinton almost made up his mind to "turn around" 
last fall. He made the first step toward this end by going to 
Seattle to preside over the Asian summit and by meeting with PRC 
Chairman Jiang Zemin for the first time since assuming office. 
  By that time, the United States had developed a new outlook 
on the international situation. After the dramatic changes in 
eastern Europe, the relations between the United States and 
Western Europe were not as close as they had been immediately 
following World War II. This was most clearly seen in the fact 
that several U.S. proposals for settling conflicts in former 
Yugoslavia were rejected by western countries. After the 
disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the United States 
sought to improve its relations with Russia. However, Yeltsin's 
position in Russia has been shaky, and he was not even able to 
appoint his trusted follower Gaidar as prime minister. 
Therefore, the importance of Russia for U.S. politics is 
questionable in the future. 
  Apart from political problems, there are economic problems. 
It is clear that Asia will grow further economically. 
President Clinton, who did not attach importance to Asia in the 
first part of his presidency, changed his outlook in the second 
half of the year. He felt it necessary to increase U.S. 
influence in Asia by establishing friendly ties with Asian 
countries anew so that the U.S. economy could draw new life from 
developing countries in this region, while China registered the 
greatest economic growth among Asian countries. 
  Over the last six months, the United States has adopted a 
carrot-and-stick policy toward China. While sending Secretaries 
of the Treasury, Commerce, and Agriculture to China to improve 
bilateral relations, Clinton sent Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to China to apply pressure. Christopher tried to 
accomplish his task by bringing China to her knees. 
  The United States has actually been following the beaten 
path. In order to return to Asia, it has applied heavy pressure 
on Asian countries over the last six months. It has applied 
pressure on Malaysia and Indonesia over the trade union problem 
and on Singapore over the caning punishment inflicted on an 
American youth. It has also threatened to impose trade 
sanctions upon Japan under the Special 301 provision in 
connection with Japan's market barriers to U.S. goods and has 
threatened to use force against North Korea on the nuclear 
issue. However, these countries all rejected the U.S. demands. 
  China's approach has been open and above-board. While 
expressing its willingness to improve relations with the United 
States and sending trade groups to the United States to place 
orders, China has opposed the high U.S. pressure. In the end, 
Clinton was forced to "turn around" on his own, correcting the 
mistake he made a year ago. To soothe different political 
factions at home, he played tricks in the wording of the 
decision and the measures concerned to cover up his 
embarrassment. 
  He announced that he would extend China's MFN trading status 
for another year, rather than extending the status indefinitely, 
as favored by the majority of American people. While indicating 
that he will not link human rights with MFN trading status in 
the future, he insisted on imposing certain sanctions. But he 
will only impose sanctions on weapons valued at $200 million, 
while the Sino-U.S. trade volume will amount to $40 billion in 
the future. 
  The problem concerning trade between China and the United 
States, about which the two sides have been haggling for a long 
time, has finally been solved because the United States has 
withdrawn from its original position, though not without 
"embarrassment."

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A group of 200 children 
from poor and rich areas across China gathered at the 
Zhongnanhai compound of the Chinese Central Government this 
afternoon to be greeted by Chinese leaders. 
  Singing and cheering, the children gathered around Jiang 
Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China, and Li Peng, Chinese premier, joined 
by other senior Chinese officials. 
  After two young pioneers presented their gifts -- red 
scarves 
worn by young pioneers -- Li sighed, "it seems that I have 
become younger." 
  Among today's guests, a little girl in her wheelchair caught 
the attention of the crowds. The girl, named Li Huang, suffers 
from congenital muscular malnutrition. But she has studied 
hard, overcoming a host of difficulties. 
  "Marvelous, marvelous," Jiang sighed after hearing the 
story. 
  Huang Cheng, a special guest from Baise prefecture, Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region, is another happy child who could 
return to school with the donation of veteran Chinese leader 
Deng Xiaoping. She asked Jiang Zemin and Li Peng to extend 
greetings and thanks to Grandpa Deng. 
  Jiang Zemin extended his festival greeting to the 170 
million 
Chinese children through the little guests present. He lauded 
the efforts of the Chinese children to make friendships bridging 
across poor and rich areas. 
  The get-together ended in applause after the children 
presented gifts they made themselves -- greeting cards. Jiang 
and Li presented schoolbags to the children.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- Only by implementing 
supplementary reforms and rationalizing all sorts of enterprise 
relations in line with the goal of establishing a modern 
enterprise system will we able to achieve greater success in 
carrying out comprehensive supplementary reforms, Li Tieying, 
state councillor and minister in charge of the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission, today pointed out when he conducted an 
investigative tour of enterprises affiliated to the No. 1 Light 
Industry Corporation in Beijing. 
  Accompanied by Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Li Tieying today made 
an investigative tour of the Beijing Optical Glass Mart, the 
Hongyun Company, Ltd; the Beijing Matches Company, Ltd; and the 
Beijing Daily Use Chemical Plant No. 2. After hearing briefings 
on the four enterprises' experience in implementing 
supplementary reforms, Li Tieying affirmed the progress that the 
No. 1 Light Industry Corporation has lately scored in trying out 
supplementary reforms. He pointed out that one of the major 
feature of the corporation's experiment is its efforts to 
implement supplementary reforms, rationalize all sorts of 
internal relations within the corporation, and transform its 
operational mechanism for the purpose of establishing a modern 
enterprise system in line with guidelines of the third plenary 
session and the requirements of the "Company Law." 
  Li Tieying said that the goal of the experiment with the 
modern enterprise system is to explore effective ways to merge 
the public sector of the economy --the state sector in 
particular -- with the market economy. He pointed out that a 
socialist market economy is an economy based on management by 
law. Enterprises must formulate new chapters in accordance with 
the modern enterprise system, strictly abide by these chapters, 
and use them to regulate enterprise activity and relations so 
that enterprise management is truly separated from government 
administration and ownership from management. 
  Officials of relevant departments including Liu Zhifeng and 
Li Runwu took part in the investigative tour.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- The state will certify 
the qualifications of engineering consulting units in China, 
according to the second plenary council meeting of the Chinese 
Engineering Consultation Association currently being held in 
Beijing. Song Ping and Yao Zhenyan attended the meeting. 
  Engineering consultation is a newly emerging industry in the 
course of reform and opening up. Through rapid development of 
more than a decade, an independent industry with some 3,000 
engineering consulting units of various kinds has taken shape in 
China. To standardize the management of the new industry and to 
provide better engineering consultation to economic construction 
and the total process of engineering projects from policy-making 
to management, the State Planning Commission recently 
promulgated the "Interim Procedures for Managing the Engineering 
Consulting Industry" and the "Interim Procedures for Certifying 
Engineering Consulting Units." These two sets of procedures 
prescribe the system for certifying qualifications of 
engineering consulting units and their compensatory service, as 
well as the principles for conducting engineering consultation 
abroad. The Chinese Engineering Consultation Association will 
certify various Chinese engineering consulting units in stages 
and by groups, classifying them into grades A, B, and C and 
issuing certificates according to their qualifications. 
  It is understood that with the approval of the State 
Council's relevant department, the Chinese Engineering 
Consultation Association will join the International Federation 
of Consultative Engineering as a national organization of the 
Chinese engineering consulting industry. The membership will 
serve as an important channel for China's engineering consulting 
industry to converge with international standards and to develop 
foreign exchange and cooperation with other members.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755) ] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- Since the Ministry of 
Agriculture called for the nationwide implementation of the 
"shopping basket" project in 1987, the quantity and quality of 
nonstaple food on the market for urban and rural citizens have 
increased and risen, thus basically satisfying the increasing 
demands of consumers in urban and rural areas. 
  In 1987, the Ministry of Agriculture, due to serious 
shortages in the nonstaple food supply in the nation and the 
need for citizens to purchase meat, eggs, milk, and even 
vegetables with ration cards, and after summing up successful 
experiments carried out in some large and medium-sized cities in 
building up integrated nonstaple food production bases, called 
for the nationwide implementation of the "shopping basket" 
project centering in the suburbs of large and medium-sized 
cities. The purpose of implementing the "shopping basket" 
project was to increase nonstaple food output, to raise the 
supply level, to apply greater force to reforming the nonstaple 
food distribution system, and to create conditions for a gradual 
lifting of the control of nonstaple food prices and for 
improving procurement and marketing of nonstaple food. 
  China's "shopping basket" product output has experienced a 
sustained and rapid growth since the "shopping basket" project 
was put into practice seven years ago. 
  The nation's total meat output in 1993 was 37.80 million 
tonnes, up 82.28 percent from 1987; egg output was 11.01 million 
tonnes, an increase of 86.55 percent over 1987; output of dairy 
products posted an increase of 58.4 percent over 1987; aquatic 
products' output was 17.85 million tonnes, representing an 
increase of 78 percent over 1987; total vegetable output was 220 
million tonnes, up 4 percent from the previous year and 60 
percent from 1987. 
  The implementation of the "shopping basket" project has 
markedly raised urban and rural citizens' food consumption 
level. China's urban and rural citizens' per capita meat 
consumption rose from 18.4 kgs in 1987 to 32.1 kgs in 1993; egg 
consumption from 5.5 kgs to 9.3 kgs; dairy products from 3.5 kgs 
to 5 kgs; aquatic products from 8.8 kgs to 15.2 kgs; vegetables 
from 135.3 kgs to 186.7 kgs; fruit products from 15.4 kgs to 
25.4 kgs. 
  The varieties and quality of nonstaple food have also 
markedly increased and risen in step with the increase in the 
quantity of nonstaple food consumption. In recent years, 
consumers have been able to buy various kinds of nonstaple food 
supplied from all corners of the country as well as great 
varieties of imported products. Cucumbers, celery, cauliflower, 
and other vegetables, which were much sought after in the past, 
are now being upstaged by some other daintier new varieties. 
Now, an abundant supply of out-of-season vegetables on the 
market has enabled urban and rural citizens to enjoy delicacies 
which were unavailable in the past. 
  The implementation of the "shopping basket" project has also 
promoted reform of China's nonstaple food distribution system. 
China has smoothly lifted controls on nonstaple food prices and 
on procuring and marketing nonstaple food. It has basically 
realized the goal of using market force, which is under the 
guidance of the state's macroeconomic policy, to regulate the 
procurement and marketing prices of nonstaple food and the 
supply and demand relationship of nonstaple foods. Reform of 
the nonstaple food distribution system has promoted the 
development of production. The market, like an "invisible 
hand," is now guiding hundreds and millions of farmers to 
readjust production structure and to increase output and 
effective supply.

  [Text] The public security bureau of Yantai Port has 
adopted effective measures to deal stern blows to the 
trafficking and selling of counterfeit bank notes. 
  The Yantai-Dalian route is one of the busiest passenger sea 
routes in China, and each year some 250 million passengers have 
entered and departed Yantai Port. Thus, this route has usually 
been called the "golden waterway." In recent years, the public 
security bureau of Yantai Port has organized capable and 
vigorous cadres to maintain public security by setting up posts, 
making rounds, and intercepting criminals. Since March 1993, 
the bureau has investigated 12 cases of trafficking and selling 
counterfeit bank notes which involved 16 persons and a total 
amount of 85,400 yuan. 
  Most of the adventurers found carrying large amounts of 
counterfeit bank notes were peasants in Henan and Anhui. 
Unwilling to hoe crops at high noon and to gain prosperity 
through hard work, these peasants indulged in deals forbidden by 
the state, that is, the purchase of bundles of counterfeit bank 
notes from dark corners for sale later in northeast China 
through this "golden waterway." However, they could not avoid 
the discerning eyes of public security cadres and policemen. On 
27 April this year, at the foyer of the Yantai Passenger Station 
where tickets are sold, Li Fuqing, a policeman of the police 
substation of the Yantai Port Public Security Bureau, seized a 
27-year-old peasant from Anhui Province who had hidden 12,600 
yuan in counterfeit bank notes in the sleeves of a sweater in 
his handbag which he planned on selling in northeast China, just 
as he bought his ship ticket.

  [Text] On 21 May, the key theoretical study group of the 
municipal party committee and the municipal government held a 
report meeting on studying the "decision" adopted at the third 
plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee. Comrade 
Wang Zhongyu, chairman of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, delivered a report "on further giving considerations 
to the issues of achieving state-owned enterprises." Chen 
Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, attended the 
report meeting. Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal 
party committee, chaired the meeting. 
  Comrade Wang Zhongyu pointed out in his report: State-owned 
enterprises, as the pillar of the national economy, have made 
great contributions to reform. The reform of state-owned 
enterprises is the key and a difficult point of economic system 
reform. The party Central Committee and the State Council have 
paid full attention to the problems of state-owned enterprises. 
  Comrade Wang Zhongyu introduced: The current development 
trend of state-owned enterprises is very good. The situation of 
enterprises has been improved. These enterprises' real profits 
have noticeably increased. The number of money-losing 
state-owned enterprises has really been reduced. In line with 
the situation that the number of money-losing state-owned 
enterprises is to be expanded and the amounts of deficits are to 
increase this year, Comrade Wang Zhongyu said: All this results 
from the facts that since the implementation of "the general 
rule for enterprises' financial affairs," "the criterion for 
enterprises' accounting," and the law on manufacturing costs 
from last July, state-owned enterprises have increased the 
depreciation rate of enterprises' equipment and have had to 
transfer some funds from enterprises' profits, such as long-term 
loan interests, newly added wages, and bonuses, to production 
costs. Although this has caused a decrease in enterprises' 
profits as kept in their accounts, changed some enterprises from 
ones with small profits into ones with deficits and from ones 
with covert deficits into ones with overt deficits, the 
enterprises' real results have increased. 
  Comrade Wang Zhongyu stressed: We should pay high attention 
to the difficulties and problems that state-owned enterprises 
are confronted with, and conscientiously solve these 
difficulties and problems. He analyzed the reasons for causing 
some enterprises' deficits, suspension of production, operation 
under capacity, and strain on capital; and then pointed out that 
state-owned enterprises have prospects and are able to enliven 
themselves. 
  In regard to the issue of how to achieve state-owned 
enterprises, Comrade Wang Zhongyu said: First, state-owned 
enterprises should change their ideas to suit the changes in the 
socialist market economic situation. Second, we should grasp 
favorable opportunities to deepen reform and to comprehensively 
reform the auxiliary systems, make key breakthroughs, and set up 
new restriction and encouragement mechanisms for enterprises. 
Third, according to different actual conditions, we should work 
out countermeasures to help state-owned enterprises handle their 
major and difficult problems. Fourth, we should expand the 
dynamics of technological reform and accelerate the readjustment 
of structures. Fifth, we should strengthen enterprise 
management and comprehensively upgrade enterprises' quality. 
Sixth, we should create conditions to set up a modern 
enterprise system and to promote the implementation of this 
system in a step-by-step manner. Seventh, we should set up a 
social guarantee system to create external conditions for 
deepening enterprises' reform. 
  Chen Xitong made a speech at the report meeting. He said: 
Setting up the frame of the socialist market economic system is 
a long-term and arduous task. So, we should not only grasp 
favorable opportunities to speed up the pace of reform but also 
make progress step by step. Advancing step-by-step is a special 
feature and an advantage of China's reform. This is a 
successful experience to stably push the large ship of reform 
forward. 
  He also said: State-owned enterprises are our foundation. 
Enterprises are still the standpoints of the overall reform. If 
we fail to enliven state-owned enterprises, it will be 
impossible for us to make a success in reform. The overall 
situation at present is not bad. We should try every possible 
means to help enliven the enterprises with difficulties so long 
as they have markets for their products and have efficiency. 
This is conducive to maintaining stability. The central 
authorities, the municipal party committee, and the municipal 
government have paid attention to the difficulties of 
state-owned enterprises. They have adopted many measures to 
help resolve their difficulties. Simultaneously, enterprises 
should be inspired with enthusiasm, strive to make explorations, 
and make efforts to study the problems of their own. Only by so 
doing will they be able to resolve their difficulties and 
problems and will we be able to attain our targets. 
  Present at the meeting were leading comrades of the 
municipal 
party committee and the municipal government, including Chen 
Guangwen and Wang Baosen; responsible comrades of the 
departments, commissions, and offices under the municipal party 
committee and the municipal government; and secretaries of party 
committees of the bureaus, general companies, and some large 
plants under the industrial work commission of the municipal 
party committee.

  [Text] Following are excerpts of a speech made by Chen 
Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, at the 
provincial work conference on opening up on 11 May: 
<H5>  1. Clearly Discern the Situation and Further Enhance the </H5>
Sense of Emergency in Broadening the Opening Up 
  Over the past few years, Hebei Province has done a great 
deal 
of work in opening the province to the outside world and scored 
marked achievements in some fields. However, the work in this 
regard has not been ideal. In particular, the development 
achieved in this regard since the beginning of this year has 
brooked no optimism. The work done in the first quarter can be 
summarized as the following three sentences: The exports of 
foreign trade showed a stable increase. The introduction of 
foreign capital decreased on a large scale. The work of foreign 
economic relations was not improved. Of the work of the "three 
foreign", except for the foreign trade in which the province is 
hopeful to fulfill the target set in the "work outline of the 
provincial party committee", the work in other two fields has 
lagged far behind. If we fail to conduct it well, there is a 
danger that nothing will come of it. 
  In view of the entire country, the opening up with the 
utilization of foreign capital as a mainstay has entered a new 
stage. Major indicators in this regard are as follows: The 
work of opening up has been further suitable to the economic 
mechanism of international markets. The practice of bringing in 
foreign capital has been gradually expanded from industries most 
of which are of manufacturing ones to basic industries, service 
industry, and industries of building infrastructures. The 
target and style of investments have incurred a large change. 
The investment made in industrial capital has been gradually 
expanded to that made in banking affairs. The per-project 
investment has gradually developed into a systematic one. These 
new changes are either opportunities or challenges for us. The 
current and actual situation of the province has shown that the 
dynamics and extent in the opening up work have not been 
sufficient and become the factors that are restricting the 
deepening of reform and the accelerating of development. We 
must further enhance the sense of emergency in opening up and 
make all-out efforts to create a new situation in the work in 
this regard. 
<H5>  2. Realistically Do a Good Job in Grasping the Three Big </H5>
Events of Opening Up 
  The first big event is to uphold the principle of paying 
simultaneous attention to enrichment and improvement and to 
accelerate the pace of building up the development zones. By 
judging from the analysis of the situation prevailing in the 19 
state-and-province-run economic and technical development zones 
throughout the province, although party committees and 
governments at all levels as well as departments concerned have 
done a great deal of work in developing these zones, generally 
speaking the work done in this regard is still not ideal. 
Except for few of them that have been better run, most of them 
have not achieved large development. The currently urgent task 
in building up the development zones is not to increase the 
number of these zones but is to persistently pay simultaneous 
attention to enriching and improving them based on the existing 
zones and to accelerate the pace of building them up. Paying 
simultaneous attention to enrichment and improvement in this 
regard means that in building up these development zones, it is 
necessary to earnestly implement the strategy set by the 
provincial party committee and the provincial people's 
government with regard to having the export-oriented economy 
bring along the development. We should adhere to the principle 
of operating the development zones with "foreign capital, 
industries, and exports" as mainstays. Efforts should be made to 
strive to have the initially-built development zones be near to 
or basically fulfill the following targets through the efforts 
of three or five years: 1) The utilization of funds with the 
combination between domestic and foreign ones and foreign 
capital should be regarded as the main, 2) The final outlet of 
products should chiefly turn toward exports or sales in foreign 
countries, 3) The character of enterprises should be chiefly of 
joint venture and cooperation, 4) In selecting and allocating 
industrial enterprises, we should take as a support the 
industrial enterprises whose products are with high added value 
and which are engaging in the intensified processing of natural 
resources and regard as a main guidance the knowledge-intensive 
and high-and-new tech industrial enterprises, 5) In economic 
operation, we should connect the standardized market mechanism 
with the international markets and try doing things in line with 
the international conventions, 6) We should train a large 
number of managerial talented personnel who know well the 
economy involved in foreign countries. 
  In building development zones, we should proceed from the 
local reality and explore multi-channels to accelerate the 
development in this regard. Through the setting up of economic 
and technical associations with domestic cities and enterprises 
and the breakthrough made in bringing in foreign capital and 
technologies, the economic and technical development zone of 
Qinhuangdao city has worked a way of development by "integrating 
its economic associations with the introduction of foreign 
capital and technologies". Its experience gained in this regard 
is worthy of drawing on. The economic and technical development 
zone of Langfang city has become a typical city in the province 
due to its fast development and best management fostered by 
upholding the principle of doing things according to the market 
law as well as by "bringing in capital to open projects, making 
money through using the land resources, raising funds through 
multi-channels, and achieving snowballing development". It is 
hoped that various localities should earnestly study their 
successful experiences and do a good job in operating their 
development zones. 
  The second big event is to rapidly make a breakthrough in 
utilizing foreign capital to conduct technical grafting and 
renovations among the out-dated enterprises. This important 
channel of utilizing foreign funds, with many advantages, may 
relieve the strained situation of funds among enterprises, may 
bring in advanced technologies and management, is helpful for 
shifting the business mechanism of enterprises, and may score 
dual results in both reform and renovations. The main reason 
why the province has taken so long to make a step in this regard 
is still the fetter of leftist concept. Under such a concept, 
localities are worrying that too much work in this regard would 
adversely affect the main-body role of state-owned enterprises 
and are afraid of being labelled with engaging in 
"privatization". They are also afraid of being labelled with 
"national betrayal" due to their transfer of some property 
rights of the state-owned enterprises. Some people also are 
afraid of being labelled with "the outflow of state interests" 
because joint venture and cooperation will be enforced among the 
profit-making enterprises. Some plant directors (managers) are 
also afraid of losing their official posts while conducting 
joint venture and cooperation. However, the crucial point in 
this regard is the subconscious worry of being "capitalist" or 
"socialist". The basic form of utilizing foreign capital to 
conduct technical grafting and renovations among the out-dated 
enterprises is the shareholding system that is a managerial 
style of assets and does not involve in the issue of being 
"capitalist" or "socialist". The first important task at 
present still is to further emancipate minds and to eliminate 
the "leftist" fetter. 
  We should earnestly study the policies on utilizing foreign 
capital to conduct technical grafting and renovations among the 
out-dated enterprises. Principles to determine which industry 
and enterprise should first utilize the foreign capital to 
conduct technical grafting and renovations, which industry and 
enterprise should have control shares, and which industry and 
enterprise can allow foreign firms to have control shares or to 
buy their whole shares, should be defined according to the 
province's strategy of economic development, according to the 
demand of readjusting the industrial structure, and in line with 
the role played by the industry and enterprise in the state plan 
and people's life. In the view of an enterprise, major 
difficult points and problems for making a decision in this 
regard include asset appraisal, the burdens of enterprises' 
debts, and the living arrangements for surplus staff members and 
workers. In dealing with these problems, we may follow many 
successful experiences gained by the province in this regard and 
draw on the good methods fostered by the fraternal provinces. 
The key to successfully handling them lies in whether we dare 
to or are willing to study these experiences and methods. As 
long as these methods can maintain and increase the value of 
state assets, we should actively and boldly adopt them and 
further improve them in a creative way in the course of 
practice. The provincial level departments concerned should 
work out specific policies and methods that are practically 
feasible and with strong serviceability. 
  We should straighten out the systems and enhance the 
organizational leadership. In viewing the utilization of 
foreign capital for conducting technical grafting and 
renovations among the out-dated enterprises characteristically, 
it means that enterprises will have one more channel of raising 
funds for technical renovations. Therefore, the task in this 
regard can be more smoothly managed by the provincial economic 
commission. There are almost 2,000 state-owned budgetary 
enterprises and more than 1,000 backbone enterprises run by the 
collectives of both urban and rural areas throughout the 
province. Therefore, we should carry out general investigation 
among them and form a line according to their conditions so as 
to determine the number of out-dated enterprises that may allow 
the enforcement of joint venture, cooperation, and technical 
grafting and renovations. After the number is fixed, we should 
force the enterprises to take up the enforcement and regard the 
enforcement as a formidable mission. From this year on, we 
should establish a strict responsibility system for the 
enforcement and have the enforcement be fulfilled within three 
years. 
  The third big event is to vigorously conduct the work of 
inviting business and introducing foreign capital by regarding 
as a focal point the seeking of large business partners and the 
talks of large projects. By judging from the comprehensive 
analysis on the current world situation in politics and the 
economy and on the steady deepening of reform, the rapid 
economic development, and the social and political stability in 
the country, the emphasis of utilizing foreign capital in next 
period should be placed on attracting the investments of large 
financial groups and large transnational corporations and on 
conducting joint venture and cooperation with them. In inviting 
foreign business we should adhere to the principle of 
introducing large, medium-sized, and small business projects 
simultaneously. However, priority should be given to seeking 
large business partners and holding talks on large projects. 
Leading comrades should go out to look for various relations, to 
establish ties with the large partners, and to strive to conduct 
cooperation with the large financial groups and large 
transnational corporations that are economically strong. 
Establishing ties with a large number of large business 
partners will play a role of getting twice the result with half 
the effort. We should establish the archives of large business 
partners and the responsibility system for personnel who have 
dealings with the large partners. We should conduct propaganda 
patiently, deeply, protractedly, and honestly among the large 
business partners and render services for them so as to enable 
them to feel that they are possessing the successful conditions 
and confident in conducting cooperation with the province. 
<H5>  3. Vigorously Improve the Environment of Opening Up and </H5>
Particularly the Intangible Environment To Promote the Quickened 
Development of the Export-Oriented Economy 
  Over the years, the province has always attached great 
importance on the improvement of the investment environment. The 
tangible environment that includes the infrastructures of 
communications, energy resources, and telecommunications, has 
been obviously improved. The intangible environment of opening 
up has also been gradually improved. However, both tangible and 
intangible environments are far from the demands of opening the 
province to the outside world in a big way. In particular, the 
gap between the intangible environment and the demands is even 
larger and it has more problems. Particularly in the course of 
developing the export-oriented economy, ideology and concept are 
out of date; the level of business talks is low; the rhythm of 
work is slow; obstacles in the cooperation are many; and the 
observance of promises is poor. Thus, great attention should be 
paid to concentrating efforts on enhancing the one sense, 
perfecting the three large systems, improving the three 
environments, and reinforcing the one contingent of 
entrepreneurs in this regard. 
  Enhancing the one sense means to enhance the sense of the 
whole people in opening up. Improving the intangible 
environment of opening up includes either the act taken by the 
government or the undertaking taken by the whole people, on 
which the society as a whole should attach great importance. We 
should truly foster a common understanding in which "every 
person poses as an investment environment, every thing 
represents the image of credit, every locality is involved in 
the opening up". We should also foster a strong sense of 
opening up and realistically integrate everything done by 
localities and local departments and personnel and particularly 
by the personnel involved in the business with foreign countries 
closely with the work of improving the environment of opening 
up, with the work of fostering and improving the province's 
image, and with the work of accelerating the pace of building 
Hebei into a strong province in the economy. 
  The three large systems that should be perfected are as 
follows: The first is the system of rendering fine-quality and 
high-efficiency services for the business with foreign 
countries. Every department in service of the business with 
foreign countries, by regarding the transformation of function 
and work style as a target, should upgrade the political and 
professional quality of service personnel and the quality and 
efficiency of services; reinforce the service function; and 
broaden the service fields. Efforts should be made to 
accelerate the establishment and improvement of the social 
service organizations, including the offices of accountants, 
lawyers, and advisers, and to provide good services for the 
broadening of opening up. The second is the system of the 
policies on the business with foreign countries and the system 
of laws and regulations that are conforming with international 
conventions. We should earnestly formulate or revise and work 
out as soon as possible policies and provisions for the province 
to encourage foreign firms to invest their money in the 
province. The third is the system of obtaining sensitive and 
first-hand information. 
  The three environments that should be improved are as 
follows: First, the social environment should be further 
improved. Efforts should be made to vigorously enhance the 
building of spiritual civilization, to deeply and protractedly 
carry out the struggle against corruption, and to strengthen the 
comprehensive management of public security. Second, the 
financial environment should be emphatically improved. Various 
financial departments should concentrate their efforts on 
enlivening the circulation of funds, vigorously open the sources 
of funds, and increase the loans and support for the "three 
types of foreign-funded" enterprises. They should also improve 
the financial service for the business with foreign countries 
and strive to establish foreign-funded and joint-venture 
financial organs or agents among the open cities throughout the 
province. Third, the environment of applying to customs should 
be improved as quickly as possible. Various relevant cities, 
prefectures, and port commissions and offices at all levels 
should grasp the enhancement of building up the port areas by 
regarding the enhancement as an important measure of improving 
the investment environment, attracting outside funds, and making 
the province's economy prosperous. Efforts should be made to 
improve the managerial systems of port offices, relax the 
conditions on the transportation of goods transfer, simplify the 
procedure of inspection, and upgrade the working efficiency. 
  Reinforcing the one contingent of entrepreneurs means that 
enterprises are the main body of opening the province to the 
outside world and that bringing in foreign capital should 
chiefly rely on the operation of enterprises. In a sense, the 
market economy is an economy run by entrepreneurs. Broadening 
the opening up, enforcing the strategy of having the 
export-oriented economy bring along development, and developing 
the export-oriented economy require a large number of 
entrepreneurs who know well the international conventions and 
the world economy. It is impossible to develop the 
export-oriented economy without the grand contingent of 
entrepreneurs who are engaging in the business with foreign 
countries and without high-quality partners for joint venture 
and cooperation with foreign countries. The province has 
possessed a quite large contingent of entrepreneurs. However, 
its quality as a whole is not high enough. In particular, 
talented personnel engaging in the work of high science and 
technology and in the high-level management are so few. Those 
who know well the foreign economic relations and foreign trade 
are also so few. Those who have a good command of laws, are 
good at business and management, and are proficient in foreign 
languages, are even more few. We must adopt effective measures 
to accelerate the training and forging of the contingent of 
entrepreneurs engaging in business with foreign countries.

  [Text] This morning, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, accompanied by Tian Fengshan, Shan 
Rongfan, and Wang Xianmin, paid an official visit to the 
provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and met with and extensively 
exchanged views with comrades of the provincial CPPCC Committee 
and responsible persons of various democratic parties. 
  Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the provincial CPPCC Committee; 
Vice 
Governor Zhou Tienong; Huang Feng, Dai Moan, Fu Shiying, Chen 
Wenzhi, Tan Fangzhi, Zhao Shijie, Chen Zhanyuan, Wang Zhitian, 
Wu Dinghe, vice chairmen of the provincial CPPCC Committee; and 
Zhang Huanchen, secretary general of the provincial CPPCC 
Committee, joined the visit. 
  Yue Qifeng said: The CPPCC system is the basic political 
system of our country. In the new situation, it is worthy of 
exploring and studying how to give better play to the role of 
the CPPCC. All democratic parties should act in line with the 
basic line centering on one central task and two basic points, 
give play to their own advantages, and promote reform, opening 
up, and economic development. He said: The CPPCC organizations 
and various democratic parties should also deeply study volume 
no. 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, clear 
up old ideas and concepts in line with reality, put forward and 
study issues with the market economic mode of thinking, and 
provide basis and reference for the provincial party committee 
and government to make scientific policy decisions. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Heilongjiang has a fairly great number of 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. This is our 
great wealth. While grasping this financial resource, we should 
also develop new ones, namely the development of nonstate 
economic sector, such as township enterprises. 
  Yue Qifeng pointed out: The waste of trained personnel is 
the greatest waste. Large and medium-sized enterprises have a 
galaxy of trained personnel, however, their role cannot be given 
full play. If we release some trained personnel to run 
nongovernmental enterprises, great results will be achieved. 
Heilongjiang has a considerable number of colleges, 
universities, and scientific research centers and institutes 
with the advantage of trained personnel. We should give full 
play to this advantage, and use the rich natural resources of 
Heilongjiang to develop intensive processing industry as well as 
high-and new-technology enterprises. It is hoped that the CPPCC 
and various democratic parties will give play to their role in 
this aspect.

  [Excerpts] Today, the provincial CPC Committee and 
government held a mobilization meeting on structural reform in 
organs directly under the provincial authorities and the 
implementation of a state civil service system to make 
arrangements for pursuing a plan to create a state civil service 
system in the Guangdong provincial party and government organs. 
The plan has recently been approved by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council. Zhu Senlin, provincial party 
deputy secretary and governor, made an important speech at the 
meeting. [passage omitted] 
  He pointed out: In our province, structural reform in 
provincial-level party and government organs has advanced from a 
stage of conducting investigation and study and carrying out 
experimental work into a stage of full implementation. Our 
experience has shown that the conditions for establishing and 
pursuing the state civil service system have matured. 
Therefore, the provincial CPC Committee and government have 
decided that government organs at all levels throughout the 
province are to fully implement the state civil service system 
and fulfill this task within a few years. The provincial CPC 
Committee and government have urged the relevant units to 
properly perform the work of making arrangements for the 
placement of those who lose their jobs due to reduced staffing 
and link this work with the development of the social productive 
forces. Structural reform and streamlining overstaffed organs 
should be carried out through various channels and at all levels.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Shen Guofang made the following announcement at a news 
briefing today. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to a question on the DPRK nuclear issue, Shen 
Guofang said: The International Atomic Energy Agency and the 
DPRK did not reach any agreement on the inspection of the 
replacement of fuel rods. There have reemerged some 
difficulties on the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, and this is a situation about which China is very 
concerned. 
  He pointed out: The key at present is that the parties 
directly involved should treat the issue calmly and make 
positive efforts in order to leave room and keep alive the 
possibility of a proper settlement. China's position favoring a 
proper settlement of the issue through dialogue and 
consultations remains unchanged. The only goal of China on this 
issue is to realize denuclearization and to safeguard peace and 
stability on the Korean peninsula, and these are in the 
interests of all.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 KYODO -- China held out against 
implementing United Nations sanctions against North Korea on 
Thursday [2 June], as the isolated communist stronghold 
continued to refuse inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  "The Chinese Government believes that although there are 
some 
difficulties for resolving this issue, there is, after all, room 
and possibility for striking a proper settlement," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said. 
  "So long as the parties concerned display sincerity and hold 
dialogue on an equal footing," he said, "it is possible to have 
these difficulties overcome." 
  Shen refused to say whether China would use its veto to 
block 
other UN Security Council members from implementing sanctions, 
but indicated they were opposed to heavy-handed sanctions. 
  "At this time, we do not favor a resort to means that might 
sharpen the confrontation," he said while calling on the parties 
involved to "remain calm." 
  North Korea has been involved in a 16-month confrontation 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. over 
verification of its suspected nuclear weapons program.

  [Text] Washington, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. State 
Department today denied a report that the United States will 
seek economic sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea (DPRK). 
  "At this point, there has not been any U.S. decision taken 
about those next steps because we want to work in tandem with 
the international community on this and hear back from the IAEA 
(the International Atomic Energy Agency)," Department 
Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said at a regular news briefing 
here. 
  The WASHINGTON POST today reported that a group of senior 
U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and Defense Secretary William Perry, met yesterday at the White 
House to prepare for formal diplomatic consultations about 
sanctions. 
  This report was published as the DPRK and IAEA remain 
deadlocked over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsular. The 
IAEA wants to conduct further inspections of DPRK's principal 
nuclear reactor, but differs with the DPRK over how such 
inspections should be conducted. 
  "Certainly we have looked into the issue and about what kind 
of form that might take," Shelly said, but "We are not ready to 
actually move to the issue of sanctions yet." "So far, the 
IAEA has not informed us that it would be impossible to carry 
out analysis of the fuel to determine the reactor's operation 
history," she added. 
  "We're really waiting to hear from the IAEA," Shelly noted, 
"We will then be able to make a decision about what is the 
appropriate U.S. response." 
  On Monday [30 May], the U.N. Security Council urged the IAEA 
and the DPRK to start immediate consultations over measures 
necessary to resolve the issue.

  [Text] Rome, June 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
arrived here today to begin a week-long commemoration of the 
50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Europe during the 
Second World War. 
  Italy is the first stop on his European trip, which also 
takes him to Britain and France. 
  During the three-day stay here Clinton will meet Italian 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Prime Minister S. Berlusconi 
to discuss bilateral relations between the countries, the 
current situation in Europe and particularly that in Bosnia. 
  The two will also examine the preparations for the summit of 
the Group of Seven industrialized nations to be held in Naples, 
Italy, next month. 
  Clinton is also expected to reaffirm his support for the new 
Italian Government. 
  According to sources Berlusconi will stress that Italy 
should 
not be excluded in efforts to settle the crisis in Bosnia. He 
will also point out to the U.S. President that Italy would not 
be idle in the process for a proposed increase of permanent 
seats in the U.N. Security Council. 
  Clinton will lay a wreath at the tomb of U.S. soldiers in 
Nettuno, who landed there in World War Two. 
  Political pundits say that Clinton's Europe trip is designed 
to reaffirm trans-Atlantic ties and to boost his image back home 
which has been adversely affected recently by a series of 
personal and public crises.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The Fifth Asia-Pacific 
International Trade Fair (ASPAT '94) is to be held here at the 
China International Exhibition Center (CIEC) from June 7 to 13, 
sources here said today. 
  About 3,000 participants from 29 countries and regions, 
including China, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Germany, India, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Thailand, the United 
States, and Hong Kong and Macao, will take part in the fair. 
  It is jointly sponsored by the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade and the United Nations Economic 
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP). 
  On display will be light industrial products, machinery 
equipment, electronic technology, communications equipment and 
products, jewelry, ornaments, garments, traditional handicrafts, 
and real estate projects. 
  The exhibition will cover more than 80,000 square meters. 
  A large trade delegation composed of high-ranking 
businessmen 
from Hong Kong will visit the fair and conduct trade talks. 
  During the fair, a number of symposiums will be held on 
expansion of electronics trade, China's current economic 
situation and investment environment, China's reform of its 
foreign trade system and investment policies, and China's 
financial and taxation reform. 
  The CIEC is understood to have invested 120 million yuan 
(about 13.8 million U.S. dollars) in building a main exhibition 
hall covering 50,000 square meters for the coming exhibition. 
  The holding of aspat'94 is to promote economic and trade 
cooperation among the Asian-Pacific countries, develop national 
economies, and explore ways for strengthening cooperation and 
jointly getting prosperous in a new world situation among the 
Asian- Pacific countries. 
  The theme of ASPAT '94 is "progress through cooperation". 
  ASPAT was first proposed in 1962 by the United Nations Asia 
and Far East Economic Commission, which is the present UN-ESCAP. 
  ASPAT is aimed to expand and develop economic cooperation 
and 
trade relations among the Asian-Pacific countries, especially 
among the developing countries, and to accelerate the economic 
cooperation between the Asian-Pacific countries and the rest of 
the world. 
  The first three ASPAT fairs were held in 1966, 1969 and 1972 
in Thailand, Iran and India, and proved to be fruitful. The 
fourth ASPAT fair, which was held in Beijing in 1985, was also a 
complete success.

  [Text] Sofia, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia is planning to 
improve its military cooperation with Bulgaria and repay part of 
its debts to the country with weapons and military spare parts, 
local media reported today. 
  A 40-member Russian Government delegation led by Oleg Lobov, 
secretary of the Russian Security Council, signed an agreement 
on the deal during a visit to Sofia earlier this week. 
  It provides for joint manufacturing of highly accurate 
surface- to-air missile systems and radar equipment for coastal 
defense. 
  Following political changes in Bulgaria in 1989 its 
relations 
with Russia have been rather cool and military cooperation at a 
low level. 
  Now, many Bulgarian institutions are calling for a 
restoration of Bulgaria's traditional ties with Russia in a bid 
to seek guarantees for national security. 
  The delegation briefed Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev on 
Russia's stance on maintaining a regional balance, peace and 
security in the Black Sea area.

<F P=106> [`Special article' by staff reporter Liu Chun (0491 5028) </F>
from Shanghai: "Why Has Clinton Changed Policies Toward China?"] 
  [Text] When interviewed by this paper the other day, Ding 
Xinhao, a Chinese expert on international relations, 
systematically analyzed and expounded on the causes and effects 
of the decision made by the Clinton administration to 
unconditionally renew China's MFN status. Ding Xinhua, 
president of the Shanghai U.S. Studies Society, Shanghai 
International Research Institute research fellow, and Shanghai 
U.S. Studies Office director, also provided some background 
material for reference. Ding Xinhao had just attended the 
"International Symposium on Economic Sanctions" in the United 
States. 
<H5>  Big Differences Within the Clinton Administration </H5>
  Ding Xinhao said: According to an executive order signed by 
President Clinton on 28 May, 1993, the U.S. President has to 
announce his decision on whether to renew China's MFN status 
before 3 June 1994. As there were two antagonistic views, one 
favoring economic interests, the other favoring political 
interests, in the country and major differences of opinion 
within the administration, the President was caught in an 
embarrassing dilemma. 
  Within the Clinton administration, nearly all of the 
officials in charge of economic affairs opposed applying 
sanctions against China, including Treasury Secretary Bentsen, 
Commerce Secretary Brown, the president's representative for 
trade negotiations, and some others. They greatly differed in 
opinion from Clinton's China policymakers. The U.S. officials 
insisting on sanctions against China were Secretary of State 
Christopher; National Security Adviser Lake; Suterbo [suo te bo 
4792 3676 0130], national security committee executive chairman; 
and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord. 
  As the two opposing factions had great influence over his 
China policy, Clinton had no choice but to reconsider his 
position on the MFN issue. Ding Xinhao noted that, since coming 
into office, Clinton has adhered to three foreign policy 
principles, specifically, revitalizing the U.S. economy, 
maintaining a certain military strength, and implementing 
democracy in the world. On the premise of differences of 
opinion within the administration, Clinton began comprehensively 
reevaluating U.S. interests. In the end, he decided to 
unconditionally renew China's MFN status with a view to 
"revitalizing the U.S. economy." 
  On the other hand, while Clinton was caught in this dilemma, 
the Chinese Government, without compromising its basic 
principles, adopted a positive approach toward the human rights 
issue, thus giving Clinton an honorable way out. 
<H5>  Why the China Policy Had To Be Changed </H5>
  The executive order signed on 28 May 1993 exposed several 
flaws in the Clinton administration's China policy. The 
executive order, a product of compromise between the President 
and the Congress, stated: China's MFN status can be renewed 
with no strings attached for the year 1993. However, China's 
MFN status will only be renewed for the year 1994 on condition 
that China has met seven "human rights" conditions by that time. 
These unrealistic "human rights" conditions placed Clinton in a 
"vicious circle": To lose "face" by renewing China's MFN status 
or to cause a retrogression in Sino-U.S. relations and make 
China and the United States suffer in respect of economic and 
trade growth by revoking China's MFN status. All these problems 
were actually the result of a very confused China policy. 
  The "WASHINGTON POST" published on 5 May of this year a 
letter written by Winston Lord to Secretary of State 
Christopher. Both Winston Lord and Christopher are Clinton's 
Asia policymakers. In the letter, Winston Lord complained about 
Clinton's unsuccessful Asia policy as well as the confusion in 
the Asia policy prevalent at that time. The letter fully 
exposed the differences and policy confusion among the 
administration's Asia policymakers. 
  The decision made yesterday by Clinton to unconditionally 
renew China's MFN status and delink the MFN issue from human 
rights was unmistakably a sign of an impending end to the 
administration's confusion about its China policy. No sooner is 
the MFN issue resolved than it is time for Clinton to 
comprehensively and realistically evaluate his China policy. 
<H5>  How Should the Human Rights Issue and MFN Be Delinked? </H5>
  Why did Clinton announce yesterday that the human rights 
issue will be delinked from the MFN issue? 
  Ding Xinhao made the following two points, believing that 
Clinton had no choice but to reach this conclusion. 
  First, historical facts have borne out that applying 
sanctions against China by revoking China's MFN status to attain 
a certain political goal will never work. In the Cold War 
years, the United States imposed an "embargo" on the socialist 
countries to no avail. The embargo on grain shipments to the 
Soviet Union in 1980 failed to prevent the Soviet Union from 
sending troops into Afghanistan. Since the end of the Cold War, 
tremendous changes have taken place in the world. It has now 
become even more impossible to attain political goals through 
economic sanctions. The economic sanctions that the United 
States has imposed against certain small countries have only 
resulted in the loss of those countries' markets for the U.S. 
"allies" and have not achieved any benefit for the United 
States. As the economic sanctions applied against those small 
countries have failed, how could they succeed when applied to a 
country as large as China? 
  Second, the practice of unilaterally linking human rights 
with economic issues and imposing sanctions against China is 
bound to make both sides suffer. According to a World Bank 
report, should the United States decide to revoke China's MFN 
status on the basis of human rights concerns, China would no 
doubt retaliate against it, thereby resulting in a disaster for 
both China and the United States. As a result, China's exports 
to the United States would drop by 42-96 percent, while the U.S. 
consumers would have to pay an additional $14.6 billion to find 
substitutes for the lost Chinese commodities. Moreover, China 
is expected to import commodities worth $700-1,000 billion over 
the next seven years, and the U.S. economy would certainly lose 
this opportunity. In 1993, China-bound U.S. exports, which were 
valued at $8.8 billion, created a total of 168,000 jobs in the 
United States. Should the United States impose sanctions on 
China, these jobs would certainly be lost. 
  On the basis of these considerations, Clinton in the end 
decided to adopt a positive approach in order to avert possible 
losses.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiakuan 
agreed today that Tokyo and Beijing should strengthen bilateral 
relations with a view to the future and thus ensure that they 
served to make a contribution to the Asia-Pacific region and the 
world at large. 
  During a 15-minute meeting, Kakizawa told Tang that the 
Japanese Government would work hard for the development of 
Sino-Japanese relations, while reflecting on and atoning for 
Japan's past atrocities. 
  He referred to the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano who publicly denied last month that the former Imperial 
Japanese Army committed the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in which many 
Chinese were killed. 
  Tang said the Chinese Government appreciated the "wise 
attitude" adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
over its perception of the past. Hata criticized Nagano for 
making the remarks and said Japan "inflicted unbearable pain and 
suffering on many people" in Asia during the war. 
  The visiting Chinese delegation headed by Tang is here for 
the 13rd round of regular consultations between the Foreign 
Ministries of the two countries. 
  On Wednesday [1 June], Tang and his Japanese counterpart 
Hiroshi Fukuda, who is leading the Japanese team, at a working 
level meeting discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and other international affairs.

  [Text] Tokyo, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- The 13th Sino-Japanese 
diplomatic consultations were held here on 1 June. Chinese Vice 
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Japanese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Hiroshi Fukuda attended the meeting. 
  According to information released by the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry, Chinese and Japanese diplomats candidly exchanged 
views on bilateral relations and the international situation. 
Both sides shared the view that it is necessary to further 
develop bilateral relations on the basis of future requirements 
so as to contribute to the Asia-Pacific region and the world as 
a whole. 
  During the consultations, the Japanese side, in referring to 
comments by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denying the 
Rape of Nanjing, reiterated that Japan would, in a spirit of 
remorse for the past, continue to exert efforts to make 
bilateral relations more mature. The Chinese side affirmed the 
wisdom of the Japanese Government and Prime Minister Hata in 
handling Nagano's comments, pointing out that correctly dealing 
with the past is the basis for developing Sino-Japanese 
relations, and it expressed its hope that similar events will 
not occur again in the future. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on bilateral economic 
relations and economic cooperation, as well as the international 
situation, including the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 KYODO -- Japan's naval forces are 
no longer exclusively defense-oriented, while the country's 
capability to project military power must be monitored 
carefully, a Chinese military journal warned in its latest issue. 
  The observations came in XIANDAI JIANCHUAN (MODERN NAVAL 
VESSELS), which ran a feature on Japan's Maritime Self-Defense 
Force. The monthly magazine is published by the Research 
Institute of Naval Vessels, a think-tank associated with the 
Chinese Navy. 
  It said Japan's naval strategy evolved from a defense of 
neighboring waters in the 1960s and 1970s to active defense of 
distant waters from the early 1980s. 
  The change in orientation was attributed not only to Japan's 
desire to protect its status as an economic superpower but to 
its alleged "militaristic desire." 
  The article cited recent developments as suggesting that 
Japan is probing world opinion regarding its embarkation on a 
"new militaristic path." 
  It cited Japan's dispatches of forces abroad for United 
Nations peacekeeping operations and minesweepers for operations 
in the Persian Gulf area as well as its participation in Rimpac 
exercises with the United States and other countries. 
  The article apparently indicates the Chinese military 
leadership still harbors strong doubts about Japan's intentions 
despite the official pronouncements in Beijing and Tokyo of 
friendly relations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The chairman of the 
Japanese Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), Keigo Ouchi, today 
announced his resignation, assuming responsibility for the 
formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group, which caused the 
DSP to leave the ruling coalition and thus created Japan's first 
minority government in 39 years. 
  He told an extraordinary session of the DSP's central 
executive committee that he would quit his post at the party 
convention next week, the local press reported. 
  Ouchi, 64, had been under pressure to step down and take 
responsibility for helping to create Kaishin. 
  The DSP is likely to select its General Secretary Takashi 
Yonezawa as Ouchi's successor, the local press quoted party 
sources as saying. 
  Ouchi, who is health and welfare minister in the government, 
has said he wants to concentrate on his duties in that post 
after formally quitting as party chairman. 
  The DSP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and three other 
parties formed Kaishin, an inter-party voting block, shortly 
after Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata was elected prime minister 
on April 25 in succession to Morihiro Hosokawa. Kaishin, the 
brain-child of coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, was viewed as 
the first step in a long-awaited political realignment in Japan. 
  But the DSP, angry that Kaishin had been formed without its 
being consulted, quit the coalition and thus left Hata with a 
minority government.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea today vowed defiance against 
unreasonable pressure concerning the replacement of fuel rods at 
a reactor. 
  On May 30, the United Nations Security Council adopted a 
presidential statement, demanding the DPRK to hold consultations 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the 
measures of the replacement of fuel rods at the reactor. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that the statement by 
the U.N. Security Council "groundlessly" slandered the DPRK. 
  He added, "It is entirely wrong for the Security Council to 
have discussed the question of the DPRK on the basis of the 
wrong judgment made by the Secretariat of the agency (IAEA) 
without any justifiable reason." 
  The presidential statement of the U.N. Security Council also 
asked the IAEA inspectors to stay in DPRK and continue the 
inspection. 
  However, the DPRK spokesman argued, "Since we are in a 
unique 
status after a temporary suspension of the effectuation of our 
declared withdrawal from the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty on 
nuclear arms), it is clear that we cannot accept such routine 
and ad hoc inspection as selected preservation of fuel rods." 
  if the IAEA Secretariat and the U.N. Security Council, 
bereft 
of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable 
attitude, DPRK will take "decisive countermeasures" to continue 
its peaceful nuclear activities, said the spokesman. 
  "We will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the 
intention to deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in 
a peaceful way through dialogue," declared the spokesman. 
  But he added, "We will counter without slightest compromise 
any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us, ignoring our 
sovereignty, if but a little."

  [Text] The Chinese Foreign Ministry on 2 June expressed 
support for President Kim Yong-sam discussing the North Korean 
nuclear issue with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. 
  Shen Guofang, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, 
revealed in today's briefing that China supports the ongoing 
active discussion between the international community and the 
countries concerned for the smooth resolution of the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  The spokesman's remark hints at the change in the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry's stance that had earlier called for the 
settlement of the nuclear issue through dialogue among the 
parties concerned -- the North and South, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, and the United States.

  [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- A reception was held 
here this evening to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Malaysia. 
  Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese 
National People's Congress (NPC) Buhe and Malaysian Ambassador 
to China Dato Noor Adlan attended the gathering, which was 
jointly sponsored by the Chinese People's Association for 
Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and the 
China-Malaysian Friendship Association (CMFA). 
  In his speech, CPAFFC President Qi Huaiyuan said that over 
the past 20 years, friendly bilateral ties and cooperation in 
political, economic, cultural and other fields have been 
steadily expanding and the friendly exchanges between the two 
peoples have increased with each passing day. 
  He noted that in recent years, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed has visited China three times and that Chinese 
Premier Li Peng and Chairman Qiao Shi of the NPC Standing 
Committee have both visited Malaysia. 
  These visits have enhanced the mutual understanding and 
trust, ushering in a new period of all-round development in 
Sino-Malaysian ties, Qi said. 
  The CPAFFC and the CMFA are willing to join the 
Malaysia-China Friendship Association and friends from all walks 
of life in malaysia and do their part in enhancing the mutual 
understanding, in consolidating and furthering the traditional 
friendship between the two peoples, and in promoting the 
continuous expansion and development of Sino-Malaysian ties of 
friendly cooperation in various fields, he said. 
  The establishment of diplomatic ties between Malaysia and 
China on May 31, 1974, "not only marked the milestone on the 
road to the development of the relations but brought back 
contacts which had once flourished between our two countries," 
Ambassador Adlan said. 
  "At no time in the history of the relations between our two 
countries have those relations been higher than they presently 
are," he said. "I cannot but draw great satisfaction and pride 
over the significant progress made in our relations." 
  He expressed the hope that the two countries grasp the 
determination of the destiny of the region in their own hands, 
build their national resilience and contribute to the progress, 
peace and security of this region and the rest of the world.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 3 KYODO -- The Chinese Government 
will soon allow the young spiritual head of the Kagyu sect of 
Tibetan Buddhism to make his first visit to his seat in Rumtek 
monastery in northeast India, sources belonging to the sect said 
Thursday [2 June]. 
  The 11-year-old Ugyen Thinley Dorjee, whose identity as the 
reincarnation of the sect's 16th karmapa was revealed in 1992, 
currently lives in the sect's former headquarters in Tsurphu 
monastery, some 50 kilometers from the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. 
  "The Chinese Government has agreed to allow the new karmapa 
to go to India for a brief visit," the sources said. The timing 
and duration of the visit is still unknown, they said. 
  A high-level team of lamas, including Tai Situ Rimponche who 
was largely responsible for the discovery of the sect's 17th 
living god, returned to the Indian capital of New Delhi after 
successful negotiations with the Chinese Government in the last 
week of May, the sources said. 
  The reincarnation of the 16th karmapa was found with Chinese 
help through a prediction letter which Tai Situ Rimpoche, a 
regent of the last karmapa, discovered in 1989 almost a decade 
after the last karmapa's death. 
  All 15 karmapas since 1193 were identified in their 
childhood 
on the basis of prediction letters left by their predecessors. 
  However, a rival group of lamas questioning the authenticity 
of the letter this March enthroned a 10-year-old Tibetan boy, 
Tenzin Chentse, in a Buddhist monastery in New Delhi claiming he 
is the last karmapa's true reincarnation. 
  According to a Tibetan follower of the sect, it is the first 
time that two karmapas have been enthroned, although numerous 
succession struggles have occurred throughout the sect's 
900-year history. 
  Both vie for control over Rumtek monastery, which became the 
sect's center after the last Karmapa fled Tibet during the 1959 
uprising. The karmapa is considered No. 3 in Tibet's 
religio-political hierarchy after the dalai lama and the panchen 
lama. 
  By retaining the new karmapa in Tibet, Beijing is trying to 
calm the restive Tibetan populace there, one expert on Tibet 
said. 
  Beijing needs a religious figure compliant to its policies, 
with the panchen lama dead in early 1989 and no successor in 
sight, and the dalai lama remaining in his self-imposed Indian 
exile, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "There Are Signs of Conservative Party Changing </F>
Its Leader"] 
  [Text] In local government elections across Britain 
yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, 
losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats. As the 
ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two 
percentage points lower than their rating in the polls. The 
results of the local elections showed that the Tories were 
reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal 
Democrats and the Labour Party. 
  The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the 
Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength 
between the two sides. 
  The Liberal Democrats had a net gain of 378 seats. Even some 
former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to 
reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats. Of 
course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances 
of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging 
constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal 
Democrats rather than Labour. 
  In the deep sorrow of defeat, some Conservatives are 
secretly 
feeling happy. They resent John Major's leadership, and would 
most willingly link Major's incompetence and lack of vision with 
the bitter defeat in the local elections. Even before all of 
the results were known, some Tories openly announced their 
determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him 
from office as early as possible. The right-winger Michael 
Portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the 
European issue, and highlighted John Major's image as a loser 
who fails to command. Obviously, all of these actions were long 
planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even 
greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled 
for 9 June. 
  Before 9 June, nobody will officially challenge for the 
position of party leader. But he who is in office must suffer 
the pain of electoral defeat. After 9 June, John Major will 
have to answer for all of the disasters, and it is time to use 
him as a scapegoat. 
  John Major is someone who was propped up by Mrs. Thatcher, 
who supported appointing the mediocre John Major as her 
successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she 
would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and 
continue to pursue the Thatcher line. Nevertheless, people 
around John Major seriously pushed him to betray Thatcher's 
doctrine, while pursuing entirely new "leftist" policies and 
affecting John Major's moves. 
  For a very long period, right-wingers and left-wingers 
argued 
over many domestic and world issues. John Major has always been 
weak and powerless, and vacillates to the left and to the right 
resulting in his own "crisis of honor." On the European issue, 
he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty, 
cultural traditions, and life-style of each country of the 
future European Union, while reflecting the islanders' mind set. 
On the one hand, he expressed the will to join the European 
family; on the other, he made one big stride closer to the 
right. While great skill is needed to have one's bread buttered 
on both sides, John Major has been relatively stupid in such 
circumstance. When expounding on such concepts, he set out a 
campaign to "return to basic values," with an emphasis on 
citizen self-discipline, taking social responsibility and 
obligations, and being upright. However, one scandal surfaced 
after another in his cabinet; consequently, British citizens saw 
how bombastic Major could be and how he failed to know himself. 
The scandals caused Major's reputation to collapse. 
  For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the 
economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of 
British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and 
suffer from a high rate of unemployment. At this critical 
juncture, John Major went back on promises made during the 
election campaign by increasing value-added tax on domestic 
fuel; as a result, things became even harder for the poor. He 
promised to reduce public expenditure, but on the contrary, it 
rose by 45.5 percent. [as published] John Major has become an 
expert in making "empty promises," while constituents continue 
to scorn this dishonest prime minister. 
  Many Conservatives believe that John Major is driven by a 
gambler's mind set. At a time when his reputation was waning, 
he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world 
issues, regardless of British national strength. This being the 
case, he wanted to try his luck in Bosnia, as well as policy 
toward China; however, he was helpless in dealing with domestic 
economic issues which would only lead Britain to an impasse. It 
will be difficult for John Major to lead the Tories in the next 
general election; therefore, news spread earlier this year that 
John Major would be replaced. 
  The setback which has resulted from defeats in the local 
elections is heavier than expected. To accelerate a leadership 
reshuffle, Conservatives have spread the opinion that "John 
Major is not up to his office." 
  However, if politicians 
from various factions compete for office by taking a 
laissez-faire attitude, the Tory unity will be jeopardized. 
This being the case, a planned transfer of power, especially 
the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the 
party chairman, is necessary. When the new party chairman is 
elected, the question of who will replace John Major will be 
settled too. Word has spread that John Major wants Chris Patten 
to become Conservative Party chairman; however, this proposal 
was rejected. That should have been a party secret; making 
public such an inside story would only provide evidence of 
political reality, namely, many Conservatives did not agree to 
Chris Patten contending for this position. There are no grounds 
to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign 
to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral 
circumstances. That would only aggravate the Tory's poor image 
as a party which enjoys little public support and has few 
talents. In actual fact, should John Major set out such a line 
in appointing people, that would only give more evidence of his 
poor ability, insight, and lack of judgment, as well as his 
self-knowledge. Now, it is just a matter of time until he 
leaves office; but nobody will let him make arrangements for the 
transfer of power. Work to seek a new leader will be conducted 
by veteran Tories; how can John Major be qualified for such a 
task?

and economic conditions in China are very favorable. Spain 
should make due efforts to expand investment in and promote 
trade relations with China. 
  Navarro said: China is a giant among the developing nations. 
Its population of 1.1 billion presents an enormous opportunity 
for Spain to develop foreign economic relations. He urged 
businessmen to utilize their potential and take advantage of 
China's favorable conditions with a strategic perceptive. He 
also said that the Spanish Government must do everything in 
helping businessmen make inroads into the Chinese market. 
  Nearly 200 businessmen and notables who are friendly toward 
China attended the symposium. Louis [name as received], foreign 
trade secretary for the Commerce Ministry, and World Bank 
representative Simon Ness [name as received], spoke on trade 
with and investment in China, respectively. Song Guoqing, PRC

Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), RENMIN RIBAO reporter He Jiazheng 
(0149 0502 2973), and XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987

  [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, CPC 
Central Committee general secretary, delivered an important 
speech at Zhongnanhai's Huairen Hall today at the closing of the 
fourth theoretical study class for senior leading cadres at 
provincial and ministerial levels. He emphatically pointed out: 
China is deepening its reform in an all-round way and the 
various tasks of establishing a socialist market economy are 
swiftly unfolding. This has presented a good opportunity for us 
to further our study of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, to raise our capability 
in applying theory to get a correct grasp of the overall 
situation, and to properly resolve our immediate problems. The 
more occupied leading cadres are, the more they should try to 
set an example in studying theory. We should study theory with 
our current problems in mind and use the theory as a guide in 
solving the problems. We should exert ourselves in creating a 
strong atmosphere of studying theory -- and applying them in 
studying and solving real problems -- among all party members. 
  The session was presided over by Hu Jintao, member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat 
of the CPC Central Committee and president of the Central Party 
School. Present at the session were Ding Guangen and Wei 
Jianxing, members of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the 
CPC Central Committee; Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the 
Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat; and Ren Jianxin, 
member of the Secretariat. 
  Following a decision of the CPC Central Committee on setting 
up theoretical study classes for principal leaders at the 
provincial and ministry levels, four such classes were conducted 
according to plan between 4 October last year to 31 May this 
year. Leading cadres at provincial and ministry levels, 
principal leaders of the major units of the People's Liberation 
Army, and comrades with leadership responsibilities on the 
propaganda and theoretical fronts -- 175 in all -- have attended 
the classes. Of the 175, 121 are members or alternate members 
of the CPC Central Committee. Comrade Jiang Zemin had informal 
talks with members of the first and third classes. At the 
conclusion of the first class and the start of the second, the 
members also heard a mobilization report by Comrade Jiang Zemin 
on earnestly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech today that for the 
purpose of accomplishing the task of arming the whole party with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the CPC Central Committee has run four 
theoretical study classes for principal leaders at the 
provincial and ministry levels. The responses from various 
quarters have been quite favorable and we have attained our set 
goals. After affirming the achievements of the study classes, 
he said that a good beginning has been made in terms of study by 
leading cadres. We must, however, refrain from overestimating 
the progress, thereby resting our laurels and coming to a 
standstill. To truly accomplish the task of arming the whole 
party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, we need to further enhance our 
understanding, intensify our studies, and work harder in using 
theory as a guide for practice. Party organizations at all 
levels still have a great deal of painstaking and meticulous 
work to do. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: The party's position and its 
historical mission in the new period have made it essential, now 
more than ever before, for cadres at all levels, leading cadres 
at all levels in particular, to attach greater importance to the 
study -- and attain a deeper understanding of -- theory. Only 
by becoming clear-headed and firm theoretically will it be 
possible for cadres to be firm and clear-headed politically, to 
become more conscientious in comprehensively carrying out the 
party's basic line, and to achieve our socialist modernization. 
The Marxist theoretical level of leading officials is, to a 
considerable extent, essential to the administrative and 
leadership levels of the ruling party and to the success of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Bearing in 
mind the overall situation and looking toward the next century 
with a strong sense of historic responsibility and mission, all 
cadres, veteran and young, must continue to study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory assiduously and lead party members in studying 
Deng Xiaoping's theory persistently, thoroughly, and 
efficiently. We must not slack in our studies. 
  Discussing ways to continuously deepen theoretical study, 
Jiang Zemin said: We have accumulated some experiences from 
seminars and study sessions sponsored by the Central Committee 
and local party committees recently. The most important of 
these experiences, and the one most worth popularizing, is the 
need to earnestly implement the principle of integrating theory 
with practice in close conjunction with the situation and tasks. 
We must persist in studying theory in the light of practical 
problems and must carry forward a good study style which 
combines study with application. We must pore over the original 
text of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, firmly 
grasping the theme of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and concentrating our minds on the party's basic 
line in order to thoroughly understand the quintessence of 
emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts, and to master 
comprehensively the theory's scientific system. Meanwhile, we 
must go deep into the realities under the guidance of the 
party's basic theory and basic line, adopt a scientific world 
outlook and methodology to conduct investigations and study, and 
seek correct answers to the questions that have arisen in the 
course of reform and economic construction, especially in 
building a socialist market economy. 
  He said: The Central Committee has decided that the overall 
situation of the work of the whole party and the entire nation 
calls for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up 
wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. This 
decision -- which was made after earnestly analyzing the 
situations at home and abroad, thoroughly studying various 
contradictions in everyday life, and extensively soliciting the 
opinions from various quarters -- reflects the requirements of 
the basic line of "one center, two basic points" as well as the 
party's deepener understanding of the objective laws having led 
the socialist modernization drive for more than a decade. 
Senior cadres in charge of important matters and the overall 
situation, must thoroughly understand the Central Committee's 
guidelines and, always bearing in mind and grasping the overall 
situation, proceed from the overall situation in considering, 
analyzing, and solving problems, so as to continually enhance 
their ability to grasp the overall situation and promote 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 
  Speaking of how to correctly grasp the overall work of the 
whole party, Jiang Zemin first called for the use of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's exposition on reform, development, and stability 
to educate and unify the thinking of large numbers of party 
members, cadres, and people. While studying and publicizing 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, particular attention had to be paid to 
combining theory with practice in studying and publicizing the 
dialectic relations between reform, development, and stability; 
and to educating and guiding cadres and people inside and 
outside the party to conscientiously safeguard the overall 
situation, to persist in taking development as the objective, 
reform as the motive force, and the safeguarding of social and 
political stability as the precondition, thereby organically 
combining the three and promoting each with the others. Second, 
it is necessary to realistically assess and judge the current 
overall situation. This is the prerequisite for grasping the 
overall situation and ensuring good work. Leaders must stay 
sober-minded and, above all, make a sober assessment of the 
situation. Third, it is necessary to solve in a positive and 
appropriate way prominent problems adversely affecting reform, 
development, and stability. We must carefully study such 
problems, identify their root causes, differentiate the 
circumstances, and strive to properly solve them through 
well-conceived plans in the course of deepening reform. Fourth, 
it is necessary to unswervingly follow the party's mass line and 
give play to the initiative of all sectors of society. We must 
deepen reform, promote development, and maintain stability. 
Herein lie the fundamental interests of the masses, which can 
be realized only by closely relying on the masses. The more 
crucial the time is, the more necessary it is for our party to 
bring into play our advantage of close ties with the masses. So 
long as we have the support of the masses, we can safeguard the 
overall situation and successfully carry out the work in all 
fields of endeavor. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: The establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure and the deepening of comprehensive 
reforms have made it imperative to strengthen and improve party 
leadership and party building, and to bring the role of party 
organizations and members into full play. It would be wrong to 
slacken our efforts in party building or to fail to bring the 
role of party organizations into full play. It would be an even 
greater mistake if we dilute and weaken party leadership by 
separating party leadership and party building from reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive, or setting the former 
in opposition to the latter. Party organizations at all levels 
must uphold the principle that the party must handle party 
affairs. This principle requires that all party members, 
leading cadres at all levels with party membership in 
particular, care for party building, that the party committee 
take the lead, and that the party secretary set a good example 
in handling party affairs. In regard to party building, the 
Central Committee has formulated plans that call for, among 
other things, making persistent efforts to arm the whole party 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, improving party conduct, building a 
clean government, and making unremitting efforts in carrying out 
the anticorruption drive. We must earnestly implement them. In 
building up party organizations, it is essential to strengthen 
democratic centralism. The fundamental way to solve problems in 
this regard is to improve rules and regulations, instituting new 
rules or amplifying existing ones as required. Where sound 
rules are already on the books, they must be followed earnestly. 
We must work hard to strengthen grassroots party organizations, 
institute a system of responsibility in this undertaking, and 
give different guidance to suit different conditions. In close 
connection with the task of deepening reform, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability, we should build up the 
fighting capacity of party organizations and work hard to 
deliver some party organizations from their state of 
incompetence and slackened morale. We must uphold the principle 
of making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in 
average age, better educated, professionally more competent, and 
with both professional ability and political integrity. We 
should work hard to build leading bodies at all levels into 
leadership collectives that unswervingly implement the party's 
basic line, dare to deal with concrete matters relating to work, 
innovate, maintain close ties with the masses, and set a good 
example in performing their official duties honestly. Meanwhile, 
we must devote earnest efforts in training and promoting younger 
cadres so they will be able to assume leading responsibilities 
beyond the year 2000. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Ours is a party in 
power. The party committees at the provincial, prefectural, and 
county levels are the central leading force for other 
organizations at the corresponding levels and over all our 
undertakings. The party committee must exercise effective 
leadership over economic work and other undertakings and, at the 
same time, improve its method of leadership. This year is a 
crucial one for China to deepen reform, promote development, and 
maintain stability. There are heavy responsibilities on the 
shoulders of leading cadres. It is hoped the rank and file will 
be of one mind, rally closely together, work cautiously, 
conscientiously, diligently, and exert themselves in an earnest 
and down-to-earth manner and with a pioneering spirit to 
continuously advance the cause of reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive. 
  At today's session, two members of the fourth study class, 
Gu 
Jinchi, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Government chairman, and 
Mao Zhiyong, Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee secretary, 
delivered reports on their studies. Wang Jialiu, Central Party 
School executive vice president, delivered a summation on the 
four study classes on behalf of the work group for the study 
classes. 
  Present at the session were officials from relevant central 
departments including Zeng Qinghong, Lu Feng, Wang Weicheng, 
Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Pang Xianzhi, Su Xing, Gong Yuzhi, 
Zheng Keyang, and Chen Fujin.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- It has been a lively 
day for the World Park in southern Beijing as Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), toured 
the park amidst the festive trappings of the International 
Children's Day. 
  Boasting miniatures of over 100 scences from 40 countries, 
the park has already been visited by nearly three million 
tourists since it opened to the public last October. 
  Accompanied by Chen Xitong, secretary of CPC's Beijing 
municipal committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan as well as other central 
and local government officials, Jiang said, "it's a great park 
as it can help enrich people's knowledge of the world, its 
geography and history." 
  Some Chinese and foreign tourists pressed forward to greet 
the Chinese president. A small boy of six or seven years old 
squeezed through the crowd to greet "Grandpa Jiang." His mother 
said the boy came to Beijing "with a wish to see party and state 
leaders, and this is really a pleasant surprise." 
  Jiang greeted a 76-year-old Canadian tourist, saying "wish 
you good health and a long life." The tourist's grandson 
invited Jiang to visit his Canadian home someday.

the Government 
  It has been seven or eight years since we began assisting 
the 
poor in development on a large scale across the country. Since 
we have always stuck to the principle of assisting the poor in 
development, we have obtained very great achievements. Vast 
numbers of cadres and people in impoverished regions across the 
country have made huge efforts on this, and various relevant 
quarters, both in the central and local authorities and all 
circles in society, have given vigorous support, thus making an 
important contribution to assisting the poor in development. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping says socialism is about eliminating 
poverty. This is a long-term and arduous historical task. The 
task of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan," as was 
discussed at the meeting, is to resolve the problem of food and 
clothing for 80 million people in the seven years from now to 
the end of this century and to help them escape poverty and 
attain prosperity. This is an unshirkable historical 
responsibility of our generation of communists and the people's 
governments at all levels. 
  Completing the task of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year 
Plan" is of great significance. First, it has a bearing on 
whether or not we can satisfactorily achieve the second-step 
strategic goal of China's modernization. At present, everyone 
across the country is striving hard with a view to doubling GNP 
again and allowing the people to lead a comparatively 
comfortable life. If the problem of clothing and food for tens 
of millions of people in China remains unsolved by the end of 
this century, then we cannot say that the second-step strategic 
goal has been satisfactorily achieved. Second, it has a bearing 
on whether or not our party and the people's government stick to 
the goal of attaining common prosperity. The PRC will have 
through half a century by the year 2000. If, in struggling for 
two generations, tens of millions of people still cannot solve 
the problem of food and clothing, but live in poverty, how can 
we embody the aim of communists wholeheartedly serving the 
people? How can we bring to light the superiority of the 
socialist system? Whenever we, communists at all levels who 
shoulder heavy responsibilities, recall this question, we will 
feel uneasy when eating and sleeping. The "80-Million-People 
Seven-Year Plan" formulated by the State Council is determined 
to steadily solve the food and clothing problem of the masses by 
the end of this century. We must never postpone the problem to 
the next century. This is a major strategic plan which is of 
significance both economically and politically and which must be 
carried out without failure. Leading comrades in party 
committees and governments at all levels and comrades in charge 
of all quarters and divisions must consider this task an 
important matter, attach great importance to it, do it properly, 
and strive to complete it as scheduled. 
<H5>  II. Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" </H5>
and Assisting Impoverished Regions To Develop Their Economies Is 
a Strategic Measure To Gradually Narrow the Difference Between 
the Eastern and Western Regions 
  Of the 80 million people throughout the country at present 
who have not completely and steadily solved the problem of food 
and clothing, over 80 percent are concentrated in the central 
and western regions, and most are concentrated in the southwest 
and northwest. Speaking in this sense, solving the problem of 
food and clothing for the masses in impoverished regions and 
helping them escape poverty and attain prosperity is a question 
of gradually narrowing the difference between the eastern and 
western regions. 
  On this question, we should have a correct and comprehensive 
understanding. 1) Differences exist objectively. The 
development of things is unbalanced. There are differences 
between different countries around the world and differences 
also exist within countries. This is determined by historical, 
natural, geographical, social, economic, and other factors. It 
is impossible to completely eliminate differences within a short 
time. 2) We should gradually narrow differences with a 
positive attitude with a view to eliminating them in the end. 
We will stick to the policy of encouraging some people and 
areas to get rich first through honest labor and legitimate 
operations so they can bring along and help the development of 
backward areas in order to achieve the goal of ultimately 
attaining the common prosperity of the whole nation. If all are 
poor, then nobody can help. Only when some areas are a little 
developed earlier and have stronger economic strength will they 
be in a position to help the backward areas. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said: "Poverty is not socialism (The Collected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping, Volume Three p 225)." He also said: 
"Socialism is not where a small number of people are rich while 
the majority of people are poor." 
  "The greatest superiority 
of socialism is common prosperity. This is something that 
reflects the nature of socialism (p 364, the same volume)." In 
order to narrow differences and achieve common prosperity, we 
have already done a great deal of work. Viewing the matter 
vertically, we see when comparing ourselves that both developed 
areas and impoverished areas are developing. Viewing it 
horizontally, the difference between impoverished and developed 
areas is tending to widen. Therefore, we must draw the great 
attention of party committees and governments at all levels, 
adopt effective measures, and make efforts to narrow differences 
between regions. 
  Encourage and urge advanced coastal areas which have 
become prosperous first and large and medium-sized cities to 
bring along and help the impoverished regions. Generally 
speaking, there are two channels to help and assist impoverished 
regions. The first channel is that we distribute national 
income a second time through the state and then tilt toward the 
impoverished regions. The second channel is that we have those 
who have become prosperous first help and assist those who will 
become prosperous later. Big cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and 
Shanghai, as well as the coastal provinces whose economies are 
comparatively developed, all have this responsibility and 
obligation. But this does not mean the simple uncompensated 
supply of money and goods, but union and cooperation on the 
basis of common development mainly through mutual benefit and 
reciprocality. There are varied forms. They can jointly 
exploit resources and transform the resource advantages into 
economic advantages. They can offer technical support to help 
upgrade quality and product standards and enhance the ability of 
economic growth. They can offer a stable sales market to 
encourage the development of production. They can offer 
employment opportunities through the importation of labor 
services. They should combine the resource advantages and labor 
advantages of impoverished regions with the technology, 
information, and capital advantages of the developed regions to 
achieve a rational allocation of resources. This is both 
beneficial to the development of impoverished regions and 
developed regions and to the coordinated developed of the entire 
national economy. This kind of cooperation is worthy of 
vigorous promotion and must be carried out. 
  The state will give sufficient financial and monetary 
support to impoverished regions. To assist the poor in 
development, there must of course be appropriate capital inputs. 
Without inputs, there will be no output, nor will there be 
enough food and clothing or development. Over the years, 
financial authorities and banks at all levels have made very 
great efforts to increase inputs to assist the poor in 
development, and they have attained good results. But in our 
work to assist the poor, we have now entered a stage where major 
difficulties have to be tackled. As time is very limited, it is 
will be very difficult to completely and steadily resolve the 
problem of food and clothing for the masses by the end of this 
century. Without corresponding guarantees of capital, it will be 
very difficult to do so. The State Council has already decided 
to provide an additional one billion yuan of work relief funds 
and one billion yuan of poverty-assistance credits at discount 
interest rates [tie xi dai kuan 6317 1873 6313 2949] beginning 
this year. In the future, as financial strength expands, the 
state will continue to increase inputs to assist the poor. 
Local governments at all levels should also increase inputs in 
impoverished regions accordingly. The three municipalities of 
Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the six coastal 
provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, and 
Liaoning, should raise their own poverty-assistance funds. The 
central authorities' poverty-assistance funds will be 
concentrated in the poverty-stricken central and western 
provinces (regions). 
  To increase inputs in poverty assistance, we cannot merely 
depend on the government, but also forces in society must pool 
poverty-assistance funds in various areas within the scope 
allowed by state policy. 
  The state should tilt major projects toward 
impoverished regions. Although impoverished regions in the 
western regions are comparatively poor at present, they are rich 
in resources, which is a big advantage. When formulating 
development plans, all divisions of the State Council should 
fully consider this advantage. They should arrange for some 
resource exploitation projects of a comparatively large scale 
and some infrastructural projects for impoverished regions in 
keeping with the principle of giving equal priority. 
Fundamentally speaking, in order to thoroughly change the 
backwardness of impoverished regions, we should, to a very large 
extent, depend on the impetus of these key large-scale projects. 
  Gradually straighten out prices of raw materials and 
primary products through reform. Under the previous 
planned economic structure, prices of raw materials and primary 
products were very low, and prices of farm products were not 
high either. Presently, the price structure and the circulation 
structure are being reformed in keeping with the requirements of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure. As reform 
is deepening, it will be possible to achieve exchange at equal 
prices for timber, petroleum, coal, nonferrous metals, and all 
other resources in nationwide integrated markets and developed 
areas. This is an important measure to promote the development 
of the central and western regions. The impoverished central 
and western regions should also use the favorable opportunity of 
reform and opening up to develop themselves. 
  Improve the quality of personnel and scientific and 
technological levels in impoverished regions. This is a 
very important measure of fundamental significance. Over the 
years, we have had very good progress in training personnel in 
impoverished regions and in exchanging cadres between the 
western and eastern regions. We should continuously stick to 
this and expand it. There are now two kinds of noteworthy 
large-scale flows across the country. The first is that of the 
labor force flowing from the west to the east and that the scale 
of labor service exports is continuously expanding. The second 
is that craftsmen and skilled personnel are flowing from the 
east to the west and that they are found in every corner of the 
cities and countryside of the western regions. 
  The flow of 
labor from the west to the east not only enables impoverished 
regions to participate in the development of the national 
economy by making use of the large numbers of employment 
opportunities created by developed coastal regions, but can also 
improve the quality of laborers in impoverished regions. This 
is a special kind of training. The flow of craftsmen and 
skilled personnel from the east to the west is, in fact, a kind 
of technology export. It can improve the technological level 
and expertise of impoverished regions in a more effective and 
more practical form. These two flows are of very great 
significance to improving the quality of laborers and improving 
scientific and technological levels and must be fully affirmed 
and continuously developed. As for the large-scale "wave of 
migrant workers," we must not let it flow freely but should 
actively divert it and rationalize its flow in an orderly way to 
reduce confusion in social order and economic losses. 
  It is necessary to experiment with open-style poverty 
assistance on the basis of sticking to developmental poverty 
assistance. In order for impoverished regions to develop, 
they surely need to develop township and town enterprises and 
develop their tertiary industry. While setting up township and 
town enterprises in these regions, we can also experiment with 
developing industry in areas with appropriate conditions by 
giving profits and tax income back to the impoverished regions 
and arrange for the employment of the labor force in these 
regions. This may overcome the unfavorable position of 
impoverished regions in developing enterprises and is beneficial 
to enhancing the efficiency of enterprises, enhancing the 
efficiency of poverty-assistance funds, and upgrading 
poverty-assistance work overall. 
  Mobilize forces in society to support the development 
and construction of impoverished regions. Over the years, 
various quarters, including state organs, mass organizations, 
democratic parties, large and medium-sized cities, developed 
regions, industrial and commercial enterprises, universities and 
colleges, scientific research academies and institutes, and the 
People's Liberation Army have carried forward the spirit of 
assisting and aiding the poor and have actively participated in 
the development and construction of the impoverished regions. 
In addition to giving financial and material support, they have 
utilized their own advantages and assisted the poor with their 
knowledge, science and technology, and talented personnel. They 
have acted as go-betweens for impoverished regions, come up with 
proposals and plans, and introduced projects and technology to 
them. They have undertaken to help a region until it finally 
gets out of poverty and attains prosperity. All these methods 
have made important contributions to poverty-assistance work at 
the previous stage. This not only reflects the affectionate 
concern of all circles in society for the impoverished regions 
but also embodies the traditional virtues of our Chinese nation. 
We hope that all circles in society can further mobilize 
themselves, have genuine affection and love, and make 
contributions. Here we have to specifically stress that I hope 
that large state industrial and commercial and foreign-trade 
enterprises extend to the impoverished regions, set up projects 
there, choose projects with good efficiency, and combine their 
own development with the development of the impoverished regions. 
  Alleviating poverty and eliminating poverty is a global 
issue. It is also the duty of the United Nations and numerous 
other international organizations. China's elimination of 
poverty is part and parcel of the world's elimination of 
poverty. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation 
between China and international organizations in assisting the 
poor in development so that the international community can 
better understand and support China's poverty-assistance work. 
  Impoverished regions should carry forward the spirit of 
self-reliance and arduous struggle. Support from the state 
and help from society are both necessary, but the efforts of the 
impoverished regions themselves are more important. External 
factors act through internal factors. Henan's Lin County and 
many other counties, townships, and villages that have become 
prosperous first have a history of arduously pioneering a cause. 
We should learn from their spirit and experiences. Only when 
we have this can we overcome difficulties, escape poverty, and 
attain prosperity. Moreover, we should pay attention to picking 
good cadres who have a spirit of making sacrifices, who can bear 
hardships and stand hard work, and who maintain ties with the 
masses; consolidate leading groups at all levels in impoverished 
counties; maintain relative stability; and allow them to rest 
assured and lead the masses in changing their backwardness. 
<H5>  III. In Implementing "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan," </H5>
We Should Carry Out the Provincial Governor Responsibility 
System, in Which Responsibility Rests at Every Level, Mainly at 
the Provincial Level, Under the Unified Leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council 
  I agree to the principle of unified leadership with 
responsibility resting at every level and mainly at the 
provincial level stressed in the 80-Million-People Seven-Year 
Plan. Taking the provincial level as the mainstay demands that 
the major responsible comrades in the provincial CPC committee 
and provincial government care for and pay good attention to 
assisting the poor. We should be clear about one point, 
however, namely that the provincial governor takes charge. 
Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" and 
solving the problem of food and clothing for the masses is a 
systematic project. It involves such economic activities as 
finance, banking, agriculture, water works, industry, and 
commerce, as well as various aspects such as culture, education, 
public health, and family planning. Practice over the years 
proves that it is not enough for vice governors to take charge 
separately as it is very difficult to coordinate various aspects 
and various quarters. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the 
head of the government to take charge of everything and make 
overall plans and arrangements. 
  The very criterion with which to measure whether or not 
leading cadres at all levels really work for the benefit of the 
people and care for the plight of the people is whether or not 
they can complete the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" as 
scheduled and solve the problem of food and clothing for the 
poor population of their own localities. When determining the 
good and bad work of a province, region, or municipality, we 
must not merely look at the rate at which its economy grows but 
also at whether its efficiency is good or bad, whether the 
people's living standards have improved quickly or not, and how 
well the problem of food and clothing for the poor population 
has been solved. Our leading comrades at all levels must not 
merely pay attention to developed regions, but must all the more 
place in their hearts the plight and warmth of the ordinary 
people of the impoverished regions. All provinces, regions, and 
municipalities must formulate their own plans in keeping with 
the demands of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan." They 
must set demands for progress and make specific plans regarding 
how many people have had their problems solved this year, how 
many will have their problems solved next year, and how the 
problem has been solved. They should conduct an inspection each 
year during which the good will be commended and the bad 
criticized so that everyone is urged to complete their tasks as 
scheduled and do not slacken their efforts at all. 
  All divisions of the government should continue to make it 
their unshirkable duty to assist the poor in development. In 
addition to mainly helping a particular impoverished region, 
they must formulate poverty-assistance plans for their own 
business or division in keeping with the tasks set forth by the 
"80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" as specific contents and 
measures for implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year 
Plan." 
  Implementing the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" is an 
arduous and glorious duty. I believe that as long as everyone 
has confidence, is united as one, makes concerted efforts, and 
courageously tackles difficulties, we will surely be able to 
achieve the goal of the "80-Million-People Seven-Year Plan" by 
the end of this century, and the economic and social development 
of the impoverished regions will enter a new stage.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng met with 
five outstanding middle-aged and young scientists here today in 
Zhongnanhai, the seat of the Chinese Central Government. 
  The five scientists were Bai Chunli, Ma Songde, Guo Lei and 
Wang Zhixin, all professors and institute directors or deputy 
directors from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and Li Bo, 
a senior engineer under the Ministry of Metallurgy. 
  When talking about the research and development in 
biological 
engineering, the premier said that Chinese scientists should 
have the high aspiration of making breakthroughs. 
  He said that the government has given support to projects 
for 
training professionals who will lead research in the related 
fields next century. 
  "China now has a number of outstanding scientists who have 
just returned from abroad," the premier said, and "the 
government should try its best to support them and create a good 
environment for their research." 
  As for the development of science, he said, "we should also 
seize every opportunity." 
  At the end of the meeting, Li expressed hope that the young 
scientists make greater contributions to the country's 
construction. 
  Li also hosted a dinner for the scientists this evening. 
  State Councillor Song Jian and CAS President Zhou Guangzhao 
were also present.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Wu Lan (2976 1526) and SHANXI RIBAO </F>
reporter Du Tianwei (2629 1131 1218)] 
  [Text] Taiyuan, 31 May (XINHUA) -- Accompanied by Hu 
Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi provincial party committee; Lu 
Gongxun, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing 
committee; and Vice Governor Guo Yuhuai, Tian Jiyun, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, went 
down to the fields and construction sites in Yangquan, Jinzhong, 
Taiyuan, Xinzhou, and other prefectures and cities for 
on-the-spot inspections from 28 to 31 May. After hearing the 
work briefing by responsible comrades, he noted that Shanxi must 
stabilize the agriculture through all possible means and promote 
the development of village and town enterprises as well as coal 
production. 
  On 28 May, Tian Jiyun and his party came to Dazhai Village 
in 
Xiyang County. He ascended the Hutou Shan with great interest 
and carefully inspected the Dazhai-type fields which decorated 
the slopes with gullies and ridges. This is the fourth time he 
ascended the Hutou Shan and he asked Guo Fenglian, secretary of 
the Dazhai Village party branch, about the production situation 
in recent years. On his third visit to Dazhai in March 1992, 
few changes were apparent in Dazhai despite over 10 years of 
reform and opening up. He was discouraged to find out that 
Dazhai still basically relied on agriculture and the per capita 
income was only 600 yuan. He encouraged the Dazhai people to 
"emancipate their minds, renew their concepts, widen their 
roads, and strive for a comfortable life with concerted efforts" 
at that time. Two years passed, and he saw a great change in 
the spirit and appearance of the Dazhai people when he came here 
again -- Dazhai Village has taken a new step in reform and 
opening up and promoted its economic development to a new level; 
it has not only further developed agriculture, but has also 
built a shirt factory, a woolen sweater factory, a cement 
factory, and started a transportation service. Last year, the 
village's total income exceeded 10 million yuan for the first 
time; of this, non-agricultural income accounted for 93.6 
percent, and per capita income reached 1,350 yuan. Tian Jiyun 
smiled with delight. He said: Within merely two years, the 
Dazhai people have paid attention to industrial and sideline 
production, reaped bumper grain harvests, and flourished in 
second and tertiary industries after ensuring grain production. 
This is a correct path. To construct a new Dazhai, it is 
necessary to adhere to the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and shift one's thinking and concepts 
from a planned economy to a market economy, as well as from a 
product economy to a commodity economy. Developing agriculture 
by merely concentrating on the production of one single kind of 
grain can only feed the people; in such a case, people will not 
eat well, much less become prosperous. He hoped that Dazhai, 
the red flag that has once been fluttering on the agricultural 
front of China, would make some achievements in the spring tide 
of the market economy and that a number of new Dazhais that 
integrate agriculture, industry, and trade for the overall 
development of agriculture, forestry, husbandry, sideline 
production, and fishing and that are constructed on the basis of 
a commodity economy would emerge in Xiyang County, Jinzhong 
Prefecture, and Shanxi Province. He once again encouraged the 
Dazhai people to "construct a socialist new Dazhai and restore 
their past heroic style with new ideas and concepts and on new 
roads and a basis. [quotation mark as received] 
  During his visit in Shanxi, Tian Jiyun inspected the 
terminal 
of the Taiyuan Airport, which was still under construction, and 
the construction site for the elevated waiting-room of Taiyuan 
Train Station. He praised the landlocked Shanxi's method of 
strengthening infrastructure construction to promote opening up. 
  After hearing the work briefings by the provincial party 
committee, provincial people's congress, and provincial 
government, Tian Jiyun noted: The idea of three foundations 
(agriculture as the foundation of the economy, infrastructure, 
and basic industries) and four emphases (coal mining, power 
supply, water diversion, and road maintenance) proposed by 
Shanxi tallies with the actual situation in Shanxi and is very 
correct. He hoped that Shanxi would stabilize agriculture 
through all possible means and develop village and town 
enterprises as well as coal production. When Tian Jiyun was 
informed that this year was Shanxi's most difficult time in coal 
production and other provinces had defaulted on 8 billion yuan 
for Shanxi's coal and freight, he said: Stabilizing coal 
production is as important as stabilizing agriculture for 
Shanxi. Only by revitalizing coal production can Shanxi 
revitalize the economy. Therefore, the difficulties and problems 
of the coal industry must be resolved through all possible means 
to boost coal production. 
  Speaking on the work of the people's congresses, Tian Jiyun 
said: Improving legislation and ruling the country by laws are 
not only necessary for the practice of a socialist market 
economy, but also a must for ensuring the state's long-term 
peace and stability. Therefore, people's congresses at all 
levels must conscientiously do a good job in legislation and 
supervision over law enforcement.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Yu-shan (7627 6276 2619) from Beijing: "CPC </F>
Guards Against Mass Disturbances"] 
  [Text] The CPC authorities recently took a series of tough 
actions; this was closely related to the present social 
situation. In addition to worsening unemployment, the inflow of 
rural migrant laborers into the cities in large numbers, the 
deterioration of inflation, the increasingly seriousness of 
crimes, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, the 
problem most worrying to the CPC authorities was the appearance 
of organized labor movements. There were also some indications 
that some labor organizations were linked with some 
intellectuals. If there is indeed an outbreak of labor unrest 
with the support of some intellectuals who give advice to the 
workers, that will be the most serious challenge CPC authorities 
will face. In the past, the CPC mounted the political stage by 
soliciting support from workers and peasants. At present, in 
addition to the growing labor movements, the sentiments of the 
peasantry are also unstable. Although peasant unrest has been 
limited to particular areas, if trouble appears among the worker 
and peasant masses and if intellectuals are also involved in the 
turmoil, than the nightmare of the CPC authorities will come 
true. 
  We may first view the living conditions of the workers. The 
authorities have admitted that one-third of the state-owned 
enterprises are running in the red; another one-third have 
incurred invisible business losses; and only the remaining 
one-third are making slight profits or making profits merely in 
the accounting books. A large number of workers are in fact 
living in the worst condition. In particular, some large 
manufacturing and mining enterprises have no money to pay wages 
to workers at all. The well-known Jixi Mining Bureau of 
Heilongjiang Province could only give 40-yuan-worth of meal 
coupons to 420,000 workers every month. The workers had to 
bring their families to the canteens to fetch the limited food 
rations, and they had no money for other consumption at all. 
  Another example was Lianzhao Coal Mine of Hunan Province. It 
was a coal mine developed according to Mao Zedong's plan for 
meeting energy needs in the south. Production was suspended 
there, and 120,000 workers became jobless. Some of them took to 
the streets and expressed their hope for "work, food, and money." 
  According to the analysis of a certain official brain trust, 
four workers now have to support one jobless person (that is, 
one-fifth of the working force is now laying idle). The 
situation in factories and mines which are running in the red is 
even more serious. In some cases, three or even two workers 
have to support one jobless person. People add burdens to each 
other, and there is no way to improve their livelihood. 
  Strong worker resentments inevitably increases 
labor-management disputes. According to statistics by the 
Ministry of Labor, last year the number of large-scale 
labor-management disputes exceeded 12,000. In some 2,500 cases, 
workers besieged plants, set fire to facilities, staged strikes, 
or detained bosses or leaders. Such events directly threatened 
the personal safety of party leaders in various factories and 
mines. In Jixi Mining Bureau, enterprise leaders did not dare 
to go to the pits for fear that they might be attacked by the 
workers. 
  The local governments did not want to report such events to 
higher authorities because assessment of their work performances 
might be affected. Therefore, the national federation of trade 
unions only recorded 460 strikes last year. However, 
investigators sent by the central authorities found that in 
Zhejiang Province alone, the number of strikes exceeded 400 last 
year. 
  The discontent of workers was also related the corrupt and 
exploitative practices of enterprise leaders and local 
officials. According to some internal investigations made by the 
national federation of trade unions, although many factories and 
mines were running in the red, the account books still recorded 
such items as "director funds" or "director-disposed funds." On 
the surface, such funds were used to develop business; in fact, 
the money was only used by the factory directors to develop 
their personal relations with leaders of other enterprises, or 
they might even line their own pockets with such money. This 
aroused strong indignation among the workers. 
  Recently, a court in Beijing sentenced Guan Zhicheng, former 
general manager of an iron and steel company in Beijing, to 
death after finding him guilty of embezzlement, and the convict 
was executed immediately in order to calm down the indignation 
of the masses. However, because the masses found that the 
authorities were evasive when handling the case, they denounced 
the execution of Guan Zhicheng as being aimed at doing away with 
a witness in a syndicated crime. Thus, other officials involved 
in the corruption case might be at large. 
  As workers are facing increasing pressure in their daily 
lives, their relations with enterprise leaders also become 
tense. In Sichuan, leaders of state-owned factories and mines 
all have pistols for self-protection. Some leaders even bring 
police barons along with them. This shows that authorities were 
indeed guarding against labor unrest. 
  The authorities did not dare to recklessly take highhanded 
action against resentful workers because they knew that workers, 
unlike intellectuals who may be persuaded, may react violently. 
On the one hand, the authorities managed to improve the living 
conditions of workers; on the other hand, an old 
method--ideological education--was used. Recently, Zhu Rongji 
approved the allocation of 500 million yuan as a relief fund for 
jobless workers who are in financial straits. However, this was 
something like trying to put out a burning carload of faggots 
with a cup of water, and would be of no avail. In addition, the 
CPC Central Propaganda Department recently organized many 
activities. It held work conferences on ideological education 
for workers in Shanghai and Sichuan. The meetings were chaired 
by Xu Weicheng, deputy director of the Central Propaganda 
Department. The authorities hoped that through such education, 
the working class would serve the overall interest and support 
reform. However, the ideologues also tried to consolidate their 
personal position by stressing the importance of political and 
ideological education. When they discussed the interests of the 
workers, they particularly shifted the contradictions to the 
foreign-funded enterprises and encouraged workers in the 
foreign-funded enterprises to organize trade unions. 
  The workers knew that this was not exactly what they 
urgently 
needed. Some workers came to realize that they had to rely on 
their own strength to strive for better conditions for their own 
survival. Beginning 1992, some fragmented organizations appeared 
among the workers. Originally, the authorities tried to include 
such organizations in the national federation of trade unions. 
However, they found that this was not feasible. So they made 
the regulations more stringent for controlling the worker 
organizations. Those which were not registered according to the 
regulations were regarded as illegal underground trade unions 
that would be banned. 
  However, underground trade unions still continued to develop 
rather rapidly. Although they were rather fragmented, they 
gradually spread in all parts of the country. In particular, 
there are more underground trade unions in South China. The 
authorities originally intended to encourage workers in the 
foreign-funded enterprises to organize trade unions, but they 
themselves are now facing the threat of underground trade unions 
in the state-owned enterprises. The authorities later even 
discovered that some of the underground trade unions had joined 
hands with some intellectuals and were greatly shocked by this 
trend. 
  In early 1994, the authorities found that the trend was 
getting more and more unfavorable to them, and they had to check 
it without delay. Material prepared by the Ministry of Public 
Security showed that 10 underground trade unions had grown on a 
considerable scale. They grew stronger by means of helping 
workers seek a livelihood when the factories and mines failed to 
guarantee it. Jobless workers were thus organized to seek 
livelihoods. Such legal activities were independent of trade 
unions controlled by the authorities. 
  Before and after 4 June last year, the authorities for the 
first time discovered that intellectuals pointed out the failure 
to identify themselves with workers and peasants when drawing a 
lesson from the 4 June incident in 1989. This aroused the 
attention of the authorities. 
  A more obvious example was that during the Second Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] in March this year, 
some worker organizations even directly submitted their 
organizational charters to the people's deputies. Some people's 
deputies even brought such documents to Beijing in order to 
spread them. This discovery further strained the nerves of the 
CPC authorities. 
  Before the NPC session the Yuan Hongbing incident happened. 
Yuan Hongbing submitted a petition letter legally to the 
Complaint Office of the NPC Standing Committee, and the petition 
was supported by a large number of workers and ordinary people. 
After that, more than 200 people visited the Complaint Office 
at the same time. The CPC authorities found that the workers 
must not be allowed to join hands with intellectuals in the 
labor movement. Last month, an underground trade union case 
reflected the action taken by the CPC authorities against such 
trend. 
  In the case, four of the 16 accused people are workers, two 
are cadres, two are self-employed workers, three are jobless 
people, and the remaining five are intellectuals, namely, Hu 
Shigen, former lecturer with the Beijing Language College; Kang 
Yuchun, former doctor with Beijing's Anding Hospital; Lu 
Zhigang, former student at the Law Department of Beijing 
University; Wang Tiancheng, former teacher in the Law Department 
of Beijing University; and Wang Peizhong, former graduate 
student in the Research Institute of Science and Technology for 
Petroleum Prospecting and Exploitation. The authorities accused 
them of organizing the "Liberal Democratic Party of China," the 
"Progressive Alliance of China," and the "Preparatory Committee 
for the Chinese Free Trade Unions." They drafted party 
constitutions and charters, "action principles and work 
methods," "interim rules for members of the Alliance," a "free 
forum," and wrote such articles as "Heroic Souls of 4 June Will 
Exist For Ever" and "On Free Trade Unions." They also 
distributed such documents and articles in large quantities. 
  While the feelings of the workers were unstable, the 
peasants were also quite upset. According to secret statistics 
kept by the authorities, 44 local post offices and banks were 
stormed and looted by peasants, because the peasants could not 
withdraw money remitted to them by their relatives from the 
coastal areas. 
  When peasants lost their temper, they did not care how 
high-ranking the officials they were facing. Last December, 
when Jiang Zemin visited Shaoshan, the home village of Mao 
Zedong, to unveil a Mao statue, he encountered a large number of 
petitioning peasants. Jiang was surrounded by the peasants for 
nearly one hour. Finally, the Hunan Provincial CPC Committee 
sent officials to coax the peasants to go away. 
  The authorities thought that if the peasants were kept from 
migration, less trouble might happen. However, a research 
project conducted by the CPC Central Committee's Policy Research 
Office on the movement of the rural labor force between 
different regions showed that peasants were moving on a large 
scale, within broad areas, over a long period of time in all 
parts of the country, and they were also involved in more and 
more trades and industries. As long as peasants leave home, 
they will immediately find that they are living at the bottom of 
society, and they cannot match urban residents in any aspect. 
They will even feel that they are being exploited by the urban 
residents. This is root cause of the potential turmoil. 
  According to the findings of the research project, in the 
six 
provinces of Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi, 
people going out to seek jobs numbered 24 million in 1993 as 
compared with only 2 million in 1982. If peasants from all 
parts of the country are included, the number is be much greater. 
  Resentment also existed among people who were neither 
workers 
nor peasants. Even urban residents also learned to express 
their discontent by taking to the streets. There were two 
petition incidents in Shanghai recently, and the municipal 
government was driven to an embarrassing position. In one case, 
the residents found that government land requisition was unfair, 
so several 
hundred people held a sit-in in front of the government 
building. Shanghai television broadcast this event. The 
municipal government originally hoped that the television report 
might explain the situation to the residents so that the dispute 
might calm down more quickly. However, the station even 
broadcast footage that showed the miserable conditions of the 
residents, and the petitioners won wider sympathy from other 
people. In another case, a large number of Shanghai people were 
taken in by unscrupulous merchants who sold counterfeit rings, 
and they petitioned the authorities for seeking help. 
  Various signs showed that if any events occurred and 
triggered off widespread popular indignation and resentment, the 
authorities would not be able to bring the situation under 
control any more. In order to prevent the potential crisis, the 
authorities had no other option but taking preemptive highhanded 
measures.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Li Anan (2621 1344 1344)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- The National Commodity 
Price Inspection Work Conference opened today in Beijing. Chen 
Jinhua, head of the National Commodity Price Inspection Leading 
Group and minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, 
spoke at the meeting. He said: With the implementation of 
various macroeconomic and price control measures and with the 
carrying out of national commodity price inspection, the 
excessive rises in the general levels of commodity prices have 
begun to slow down. 
  Vice Premier of the State Council Zou Jiahua attended 
today's 
meeting. During the meeting, Chen Jinhua reviewed the national 
commodity price inspection work in the previous period. He 
pointed out that the work on national commodity price inspection 
has achieved initial results, thanks to the transmission of the 
circular calling for implementing price inspection, to the 
spreading of the news on carrying out price inspection, and to 
the arrangement made jointly since March by commodity price 
departments and other relevant departments on price inspection. 
He listed the following as the major accomplishments of price 
inspection work. 
  -- Price inspection has helped raise the people's awareness 
of the necessity of regulating and controlling prices under a 
market economy. Since the beginning of this year, leading 
comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have 
repeatedly stressed the need for enhancing macroeconomic 
regulation and control, bringing down inflation, and maintaining 
social order. During national commodity price inspection, the 
State Planning Commission and propaganda department launched a 
propaganda drive aimed at deepening reform, enhancing 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and promoting healthy 
market growth. This drive has helped bring about a favorable 
climate to stress the need for exercising regulation, control, 
and management over prices under a commodity market economy and 
marked the beginning of a change in the laissez-faire attitude 
over the decontrolled prices. 
  -- Price inspection has promoted the implementation of price 
regulation, control, and management measures formulated by the 
state. Some provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) 
have begun establishing a grain risk fund system. The system of 
showing clear price-markings on commodities and of a clear 
listing of service charges has been promoted at state and 
collective-owned retail stores and at fee-charging 
administrative units. Private enterprises and individual 
vendors have also begun to show more responsiveness to the call 
for clear price markings and to the call for clear indications 
of service charges. A considerable number of provinces 
(autonomous regions and municipalities) have worked out specific 
rules for supervising and reviewing the prices of daily 
necessities and service charges. 
  -- Price inspection has helped investigate and deal with a 
number of cases involving pricing irregularities. Various 
localities have conducted checks on the prices of consumer 
goods, on monopolistic means of production prices, and service 
charges. According to incomplete statistics, between the period 
of 10 March and 10 May, over 190,000 cases of pricing 
irregularities were uncovered throughout the nation involving 
illicit gains of about 400 million yuan. So far, 100,000 cases 
of pricing irregularities have been dealt with and fines of over 
88 million yuan have been imposed. As a result of investigating 
and handling cases of pricing irregularities, the practices of 
price gouging and of arbitrary fee collection have been checked. 
Localities have paid particular attention to disclosing the 
handling of a number of serious cases which have created a great 
social impact. So far, various localities have publicly handled 
some 1,200 cases of price irregularities. 
  -- Price inspection has helped manufacturers and business 
operators to strengthen in-house price management. During the 
national commodity price inspection, many enterprises conducted 
in-house price-checks, reported voluntarily on pricing, 
corrected their pricing mistakes, and standardized price-setting 
practices of their own accord. 
  Chen Jinhua stressed that the CPC Central Committee, the 
State Council, and the masses had attached great importance to 
and placed great expectations on national commodity price 
inspection. Price inspection tasks had been arduous and were 
conducted in very short time. The next task for various levels 
of governments, he said, is to conscientiously review previous 
work, sort out problems, analyze causes of the problems, 
formulate countermeasures, and carry out price inspection work 
in a down-to-earth and in-depth manner. Chen Jinhua said it is 
necessary to enhance leadership and to exert efforts by placing 
priority on checking key product prices whose sharp rises affect 
the general level of commodity prices and to checking prices of 
other products and service charges whose rises cause the masses' 
great dissatisfaction. The first priority, he said, should go 
to checking the prices of grain, cotton, and other daily 
necessities. The second priority should be to check rural 
areas' electricity rates and the prices of such means of 
production as steel and refined oil. The third priority is to 
check basic service charges. The purpose of checking key 
product prices, Chen Jinhua noted, is to put to a stop to the 
practices of pricing irregularities and to help bring stability 
into the masses' basic life. The guiding and supervisory roles 
of public opinion should be brought into full play. Deeds of 
advanced models should be publicized. Efforts must be made to 
strictly investigate into and deal with a number of typically 
bad cases; those who are found to have been involved in the 
practices of price-gouging and of making arbitrary collections 
of fees must be exposed to the public. This will encourage the 
people, help enterprises adopt proper price-setting behavior, 
and deter would-be price-gouging units and individuals. It is 
necessary to treat a disease by looking into both its root cause 
and symptoms. Therefore, efforts should be made to improve and 
perfect existing laws and regulations and accelerate the pace of 
pricing legislation. There is a need to persist in carrying out 
price inspections together with conducting an investigation and 
study of pricing problems; to sum up experiences; to plug 
loopholes; and to study measures to enhance price regulation, 
control, and management. He expressed the hope that departments 
concerned will continue close coordination, bring into play 
their respective advantages, and continue to help the masses 
supervise prices. He also said that it is necessary to 
strengthen leadership over pricing work, to help maintain 
stability at price-related organs, to increase price inspection 
work force, and to improve the price inspection method. In 
conclusion, Chen Jinhua called on all levels of governments to 
show greater concern and support for price inspection work.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Correctly Handle Relationship </F>
Between Reform, Development, and Stability"] 
  [Text] This year, as a crucial year in China's march 
toward the goal of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, we will face arduous and difficult tasks in reform 
and development. Correctly understanding and handling the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability is of 
important significance to the proper manipulation of the general 
work set forth by the central authorities and to the successful 
completion of all tasks. 
  Reform, development, and stability, which form a dialectical 
unity, are interrelated and complement each other. They are 
three indispensable pivots supporting the comprehensive 
development of society. Reform is the motivating force, 
development is the goal, and stability is the indispensable 
precondition for reform and development, while reform and 
development on their part serve as a solid foundation ensuring 
social stability and perpetual political stability. We must 
certainly proceed from the general interests and make sure 
everything is properly done regarding reform, development, and 
stability. Failure in any one of these three aspects is bound 
to affect the two other aspects and thus upset the whole 
situation. 
  Deepening reform and expanding the opening up process is the 
only way to boost the economy. Reform is a process of 
self-perfection and the development of the socialist system. 
Reform further revitalizes the productive forces in society and 
brings forth great economic development through a profound 
readjustment of the relationship between the productive forces 
and production relations and of that between the economic base 
and the superstructure of socialist society. The further reform 
and opening up advances, the more conditions favorable to 
economic development are available. In the course of its 
development, China's economy still faces some contradictions and 
difficulties. For instance, the unsound state of the 
macroeconomic regulation and control system, the irrational 
economic structure, and the serious drain on the central 
government's financial and tax revenues; the overexpanded scale 
of investment in fixed assets and the rather wide margin of 
price increases, which have resulted in more restrictive 
"bottleneck" effects on economic growth and stronger 
inflationary pressures; greater operational difficulties facing 
many state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and the 
undermining of agriculture as the basis; and so on. These 
phenomena are due to the interaction between residual 
shortcomings of the old structure and the unsound state of the 
new structure and mechanisms, and are problems stemming from the 
deeper level of the structure, which is inevitable when reform 
is advancing on all fronts. The fundamental solution to the 
problems should be to further in-depth reform. Since last year, 
the central authorities have advanced reform to a new 
breakthrough stage in key links and reform is advancing on all 
fronts in accordance with the requirement for the establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure. Plans to reform the 
financial and taxation system, the banking system, the 
investment system, and the foreign trade system have been 
formulated and put forth, while enterprise reform is continuing 
to develop in depth with the focus laid on the transformation of 
operational mechanisms, and efforts are being made to foster the 
market system and to establish and perfect a system of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. These new measures and 
plans are to meet the objective needs of and serve as an 
effective guarantee for the in-depth development of reform. If 
we fail to conscientiously and promptly carry out these measures 
and plans, it will be difficult for us to deepen reform, the 
process of establishing a socialist market economic structure 
will be prolonged, and, consequently, long-term economic 
development will be jeopardized. So long as we fight this 
"hard-won major campaign" well and successfully establish the 
basic framework of a socialist market economy, we will lay down 
an important foundation for the revitalization of China's 
economy. Therefore, leading people at all levels must devote 
more energy to reform; work more conscientiously, more 
meticulously, and in a down-to-earth manner; and ensure constant 
development of in-depth reform. They must further emancipate 
their minds, uphold the principle of proceeding in everything 
from reality, boldly blaze new trails, sum up experiences in 
good time, properly solve contradictions and problems arising 
from the in-depth development of reform, and thus ensure the 
successful accomplishment of all reform targets. 
  Development is the last word. It is the starting point and 
the destination of reform, and the result of the reforms will 
finally be displayed through development. In order to prepare a 
solid material basis for all the undertakings of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, the key lies in economic development. 
To achieve development we need new ideas and new methods, which 
spring from reform. Bypassing reform as a key process means we 
are seeking development through the old structure and old 
methods. Only by conducting reform, establishing a new 
structure, and creating new methods will we be able achieve 
development. When talking about development, we not only mean 
striving to achieve a quantitative increase, but also to seek a 
qualitative improvement of the economy. We must increase 
economic returns through structural readjustment, technological 
transformation, product development, and scientific management, 
and we should no longer follow the old path of extensive 
management--blindly seeking high output and expanding the scale 
of investment. 
  The normal operation and healthy development 
of the socialist market economy depends on coordination between 
different trades and between the part and the whole, and on the 
balance between economic returns and the growth rate. When 
seeking development, a locality or a sector should never 
sacrifice general and long-term interests for partial and 
immediate interests. Partial interests must be submitted to 
general interests, and one must give consideration to partial 
interests as well when seeking general interests. Only in this 
way can both partial and general interests be promoted side by 
side. The economic growth rate should increase along with an 
improvement in economic returns. The growth rate should be set 
within the limits of our resources and ability. We do not want 
a high growth rate only, but also steady and solid growth with 
the simultaneous improvement of economic returns ensured. This 
sort of development is solid development, the sort of 
development that socialism with Chinese characteristics wants 
and which we are striving for while ensuring stability. 
  Reform and development needs a stable social environment. 
Without stability, no economy can thrive under any social 
system. There are no exceptions in history, in China or in other 
parts of the world alike. Only when a country is enjoying 
political and social stability and the public are in a tranquil 
mental state can reform be carried out in an orderly manner and 
can the country achieve its set targets for development. 
Without stability, nothing can be achieved. Reform cannot be 
carried out successfully, let alone development. As pointed out 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping: "Without a stable environment, 
everything will fall through. Even achievements already made 
will be void." Of course, reform and development can also give 
an impetus to the promotion of stability. Reform helps eliminate 
existing irregularities and problems and establishes a more 
scientific and rational new structure, thus bringing about 
economic prosperity and an improvement in living standards. 
This is also a reliable approach to and fundamental guarantee 
for the achievement of stability. 
  Properly handling the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability is an important strategic matter 
which has a bearing on the development of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The faster reform develops in depth, the more 
one needs to keep sober-headed. It is necessary to 
comprehensively analyze and accurately judge the basic 
conditions regarding reform, development, and stability from a 
realistic point of view and in light of actual circumstances, 
and then handle the situation properly. 
  Out of consideration for general interests which rest on 
reform, development, and stability, we must treat and resolve 
the issues of an overheated economy and inflation. At present, 
the scale of ongoing construction projects is already very large 
in our country. The scale of investment to be launched this year 
is not small either, and therefore restrictions due to the 
"bottleneck" effect and inflationary pressures will increase in 
the wake of economic development. Nevertheless, some localities 
and sectors are still blindly seeking high output value and 
growth rates and are expanding the scale of investment in quite 
a big way. If the scale of investment gets seriously out of 
control, this will inevitably aggravate inflation and price 
hikes. It will not only cause drastic economic fluctuations and 
affect the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development 
process, but will also create many difficulties in the basic 
livelihood of the public. Exceptional increases in commodity 
prices will in turn disturb the public and cause social unrest, 
affecting the smooth progress of reform and economic development 
as a whole. Therefore, this problem will not only affect reform 
and development but will also upset social stability; therefore, 
it is necessary to deal with it seriously. All localities and 
all sectors must give first consideration to general interests, 
strictly implement the state's macroeconomic regulation and 
control policy, set an appropriate development speed according 
to their own conditions, and actively support the central 
authorities in comprehensively coordinating economic operations 
and maintaining a balance between aggregate supply and demand. 
  Out of a consideration of the general interests which rest 
on 
reform, development, and stability, we must make great efforts 
to reinvigorate state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises 
and agriculture, both of which are the mainstays and foundation 
of the national economy and support social development and 
stability. How well they do will not only determine whether 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development can be 
maintained, but will also have a bearing on improved living 
standards for the vast number of staff members, workers, 
peasants, and cadres. Running well state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises and reform of the agricultural 
structure will not only give a great impetus to overall 
development and to work on all fronts, but will also help 
promote closer ties between the party and the public and 
consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, thus ensuring that the 
party and the masses, as well as the workers and peasants, will 
work together with one heart and one mind to safeguard the 
general interests. All localities and sectors must place the 
operation to invigorate state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises as the order of the day, work hard to ensure a 
smooth transformation of the operational mechanism of 
state-owned enterprises, gradually establish a modern enterprise 
system, actively improve the internal management of enterprises, 
vitalize enterprises, increase their potential for development, 
make sure the value of state-owned assets is preserved and 
increased, and give full play to the leading role of state-owned 
enterprises in the national economy. Principal leading members 
of party committees at all levels must personally attend to 
work; adopt effective measures to reinforce the position of 
agriculture as a basic sector; promote the comprehensive 
development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and 
fisheries while ensuring steady growth in grain and cotton 
output; keep township and town enterprises constantly growing; 
and make every effort to ensure increasing peasants' incomes. 
  Out of consideration for the general interests which rest 
on reform, development, and stability, we must correctly handle 
all kinds of social problems that emerge in the wake of reform 
and development. Reform as a process of readjustment in the 
interest structure and relations will inevitably give rise to 
one type of social problem or another. Failure to properly 
solve these problems will jeopardize the general interests. Our 
cadres at all levels must conscientiously look into 
contradictions among the people that arise from new 
circumstances, and distinguish between the two categories of 
contradictions of a different nature and handle them correctly. 
They must try to correctly handle relations between the urban 
and rural areas, as well as the relations between the central 
and western parts of the country on the one hand and coastal 
areas on the other, and properly deal with issues concerning 
nationality solidarity, economic development in minority 
nationality areas, and the issue of unfair distribution of 
income and great disparities in income. They must be concerned 
about the people's livelihood. Reform has brought about 
extensive, remarkable improvement in the people's living 
standards, but there are still some people with limited income 
or who are living in poverty. Therefore, our cadres at all 
levels, while concentrating on deepening reform of state- owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises and reform of the 
agricultural structure, must always bear in mind the masses' 
wellbeing and show special concern for and extend aid to those 
in difficulties. In relaxing price controls, one should never 
relax market management. By relying on market regulation alone, 
we can hardly stabilize the prices of important commodities that 
have a direct bearing on the people's livelihood. Therefore, we 
must strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control with a view 
to keeping commodity prices stable. All localities must pay 
attention to the "shopping basket" project and try their best to 
raise the people's living standards. 
  Out of consideration for the general interests which rest on 
reform, development, and stability, we must carry on the 
anticorruption struggle in depth, unremittingly, and more 
efficiently, and step up the comprehensive management of social 
order with real earnest. The struggle against corruption is a 
task of vital importance to the party's survival. If we let 
corruption spread unchecked, we will lose popular support. If 
so, we can hardly ensure social stability even with a prosperous 
economy. At present, the anticorruption struggle remains a very 
arduous task and brooks no slackness. The key to the 
anticorruption operation lies in strengthening leadership and 
keeping up our efforts. It is necessary to perfectly combine 
the anticorruption struggle with deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, and expediting development; to fully rely on the 
masses; to take actions to deal with both symptoms and root 
causes; and to make unremitting efforts to strive for new 
successes. Poor conditions of social order may have a very bad 
influence on reform and opening up, economic construction, and 
social stability. Straightening out social order is the 
public's strong desire and an important duty of governments at 
all levels. This issue must be brought to the attention of 
leaders at all levels, and effective measures must be taken to 
solve it. It is necessary to deal severe blows at all kinds of 
criminal activities and hooligans, thieves, and robbers who 
threaten and jeopardize people's lives, state security, and 
nationality solidarity. It is necessary to resolutely do away 
with the practice of being hard on the one hand but soft on the 
other, promote both the material and spiritual civilizations, 
and strive to thoroughly improve social order. 
  The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics 
is the basis of the scientific theory guiding us to properly 
handle the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave a precise and scientific 
exposition of this issue in volume three of his Selected 
Works. General Secretary Jiang Zemin also brilliantly 
elaborated his view in this regard in his report to the 14th 
party congress and in a series of speeches. By conscientiously 
studying these ideological theories, thoroughly understanding 
the essences of these theories, and by applying them to the 
social practice of reform and opening up, we will be able to win 
one victory after another in the course of reform and 
development, constantly preserve social and political stability, 
and continuously advance the socialist cause.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Public Security 
Ministry recently distributed a circular calling on public 
security organizations at various levels to make concentrated 
efforts to investigate and ban the illegal production and sale 
of police uniforms and police insignia and emblems, and to 
seriously crack down on the activities of impersonating 
policemen. 
  The "circular" says: Over the past year, public security 
organizations have done a lot of work and achieved some good 
results in investigating and banning the illegal production and 
sale of police uniforms and police insignia and emblems and 
cracking down on the activities of impersonating policemen. 
Nevertheless, the situation of producing and selling police 
uniforms, police insignia and emblems, and police equipment by 
some plants and units is still quite serious. The situation of 
impersonating policemen by a small number of people is still 
quite conspicuous. Some criminals bought police uniforms to 
impersonate policemen and commit crimes. This has seriously 
endangered public security in the society and undermined the 
reputation of the people's police. 
  The "circular" points out: It is imperative to seriously 
handle those cases involving the illegal production and sale of 
police uniforms and signs, the illegal wearing of police 
uniforms and insignia, and swindling by impersonating policemen 
in accordance with related regulations. It is necessary to 
investigate criminal responsibility of those whose cases are 
serious and constitute crimes.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- China published a white 
paper on the "situation of Chinese women" here today, pleading 
renewed efforts to further improve both living and working 
conditions of the female population which is playing an 
increasingly important role in China's state affairs. 
  The white paper, issued by the Information Office of the 
State Council of the People's Republic of China, consists of a 
foreword and eight chapters. 
  Through facts and figures, the 20,000-word-plus report 
reviewed the historic liberation of Chinese women in the course 
of the new democratic revolution and the socialist revolution 
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, as well as 
their status and role under the socialist system. 
  According to the white paper, the Chinese women have 
achieved 
truly historic advances toward the goal of "equality, 
development and peace" over the past 45 years, especially in the 
15 years since the introduction of reform and opening to the 
outside world. 
  "This great forward march is an important component of the 
progressive cause of women worldwide; it is also an important 
part of the progress China has made in human rights," it notes. 
  China is a developing country. Owing to the constraints of 
social development and the influence of old concepts, the 
condition of Chinese women is "still not satisfactory", as there 
exist various difficulties and resistance which have prevented 
the full realization for equal rights to women with respect to 
their participation in political and government affairs, 
employment, access to education, as well as marriage and family, 
the white paper admits. 
  "The Chinese Government is making every effort to develop 
the 
economy, strengthen the legal system, eradicate all backward 
ideas of discriminating against and looking down on women and 
promote equal rights for men and women in all spheres of social 
life as stipulated in Chinese law," the report says, adding that 
this will speed the realization of the various development goals 
of the Nairobi strategies in China before the end of this 
century. 
  A leading official from the information office of the State 
Council said the white paper was published with the aim to 
enabling the international community to acquire a better 
understanding of women's conditions in China, host to the fourth 
world conference on women. 
  He said that China is actively preparing for the conference 
on women, which is to be held in Beijing in September 1995.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Government 
attaches great importance to providing legal protection for 
females and women in China enjoy equal legal status with men. 
  This is the statement explicitly laid down in the white 
paper 
on the situation of Chinese women issued here today by the 
Information Office of China's State Council. 
  The white paper says that a comprehensive legal system has 
come into being in China to protect the rights and interests of 
women and promote sexual equality. The system takes the 
Constitution as the basis and the Law on the Protection of 
Rights and Interests of Women as the core, and encompasses 
various specific state laws and regulations, administrative 
decrees and regulations enacted by various government 
departments as well as local legislation. 
  According to the white paper, the basic principles in 
China's 
legislative work concerning women are equal rights for men and 
women, protection of the special rights and interests of women, 
and the banning of any discrimination, maltreatment and 
persecution directed at women. 
  The state Constitution clearly stipulates, "Women enjoy 
equal 
rights with men in all spheres of life, including political, 
economic, cultural and social aspects as well as in family life." 
  Moreover, "the state applies the principle of equal pay for 
equal work for men and women alike and trains and selects cadres 
from among women", according the Constitution. 
  The white paper informs that since the founding of the 
People's Republic of China in 1949, the government has 
promulgated over 10 fundamental laws, including the Marriage 
Law, Electoral Law, Law of Inheritance, Civil Law and Criminal 
Law. The State Council and various ministries and commissions 
under it have enacted over 40 administrative decrees and 
regulation. Besides, various local governments have devised 
more than 80 local regulations and rules. 
  The white paper stresses that all these legislations include 
clear provisions on the protection of the rights and interests 
of women. No law in China contains clauses that discriminate 
against women. 
  More significantly, the Chinese Law on the Protection of the 
Rights and Interests on Women promulgated in 1992 has provided 
an effective legal weapon for further enhancing the social 
status of women and guaranteeing their basic rights and 
interests. 
  The white paper says that under Chinese law, the legitimate 
rights of women can be summed up into the following six aspects: 
  -- Women enjoy equal political rights with men. Women have 
the right, through various channels and in various ways, to 
administer state and social affairs, and enjoy equal rights to 
vote and stand for election. 
  -- Women enjoy equal rights with men with respect to culture 
and education. 
  -- Women are granted equal working rights with men. 
  -- Women enjoy equal property rights with men. The law 
stipulates that with regard to marriage and family property, 
women enjoy equal ownership and inheritance rights with men. 
  -- Women enjoy equal rights with men relating to their 
persons. 
  -- Women enjoy equal rights with men in marriage and the 
family. The law states that women enjoy equal freedom in 
marriage and divorce, and the relations between husband and wife 
are equal. Women are subject to special protection with regard 
to divorce. 
  The white paper says that at present, China is still at the 
primary stage of socialism and remains comparatively 
underdeveloped in economic and cultural development. Therefore, 
certain provisions on the legal rights of women and guarantee 
mechanisms need to be further improved. 
  However, the white paper makes it clear that along with the 
in- depth development of China's modernization drive, the 
country's legal system on the promotion of women's rights and 
interests will be perfected.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- A white paper on the 
situation of Chinese women issued here today says that in 
comparison with women's exclusion from social life in old China, 
New China has enabled women to make conspicuous progress in all 
aspects of society. 
  It singles out the fields of education, science and 
technology, culture, sports and public health as areas in which 
women excel. 
  The Chinese Government has exerted great efforts to promote 
women's education. In 1992 the attendance rate for girls from 
seven to 11 years old had risen to 96.2 percent from less than 
20 percent before the founding of the People's Republic of China 
in 1949, the white paper issued by the Information Office under 
the State Council says. 
  The proportion of females in middle schools, colleges and 
postgraduate schools has reached 43.1 percent, 33.7 percent and 
24.8 percent respectively. From 1982, when the academic degree 
system was resumed, to 1993 some 1,149 women were awarded 
doctorates, making up 9.4 percent of total Ph.D recipients. 
  The paper goes on to say that China also pays special 
attention to promoting adult and vocational education, and 
eliminating illiteracy among women. 
  Over 13 million women are enrolled in institutions of higher 
learning. Over the period of 45 years since the founding of the 
People's Republic, more than 110 million women illiterates have 
been taught to read, reducing the female illiteracy rate from 90 
percent in 1949 to 32 percent in 1993. 
  According to the paper, the Chinese Government has attached 
great importance to training women scientists and technicians, 
trying to improve their working and living conditions and 
encouraging and supporting them in their scientific research. 
  In 1993, China had 8,097,000 women scientists and 
technicians, making up 35 percent of the total, the white paper 
says. 
  The paper also gives an account of the achievements made by 
Chinese women in education, culture and arts, physical training, 
and maternity and child care. 
  It says that between 1949 and 1993 Chinese athletes won 775 
world championships, of which 460, or 59 percent, were won by 
women. 
  However, the paper says that, owing to historical reasons 
and 
the constraints of the level of social, economic and cultural 
development, some problems continue to impede women's full 
participation in social life and must not be ignored. 
  It notes that, in particular, the majority of women have a 
low level of education and in some rural areas, especially in 
remote or border regions, female children are not fully 
guaranteed their right to education. The government and social 
organizations are adopting measures to overcome these 
inadequacies, the paper says.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Independent marriage 
based on mutual love and a family life in which husband and wife 
are equal have become the main current in contemporary Chinese 
society, says a white paper released by the Information Office 
of China's State Council today. 
  The white paper, entitled The Situation of Chinese Women, 
says that the founding of New China in 1949 put an end to the 
feudal marital and family system that had endured for several 
millennia. 
  In New China, the white paper says, women have gained the 
right of self-determination in marriage and enjoyed equal status 
in family and the same rights of possession and inheritance of 
family property as men. 
  Sample investigations show that 74 percent of young couples 
make the decision themselves to wed or do so after consultation 
with their parents, it says. 
  In old China, the white paper says, over 95 percent of 
marriages were arranged and on a monetary basis. 
  It says that Chinese women have gained the important 
personal 
right of being able to retain their maiden names. In old China, 
most women had no formal name before marriage. They adopted 
their husband's surname after they wed. 
  The white paper says that in New China, women earn their own 
income through work. The share of women's earnings in total 
family income has risen from 20 percent in the 1950s to the 
present 40 percent. 
  "As they have become economically independent," the white 
paper says, "Chinese women have gained more management and 
decision-making power in principal family and economic matters. 
Sample investigations show that in over 58 percent of urban and 
rural families, major affairs are decided by the husband and 
wife together. This figure continues to climb." 
  China has 267 million families and every year about 10 
million newlywed couples join their ranks. Currently, the 
divorce rate in China is 1.54 per thousand, the white paper says. 
  "Because Chinese families are basically stable," the white 
paper says, "family functions, such as living arrangements, 
child rearing and support for the elderly, are fully in 
evidence." 
  The white paper says that women's rights to decide whether 
or 
not to bear children are duly protected. In old China, women 
were just child bearing tools, and they were often persecuted by 
their parents-in-law or abandoned by their husbands because they 
were unable to provide any offspring, let alone a son. In New 
China, women are in control of their own child bearing and they 
can discuss with their spouses whether or not they will go 
through with a pregnancy. 
  The white paper points out that maternal health is protected 
by the state. By the end of 1992, China had 346 maternity and 
children's health care centers, 2,841 clinics and 34 pediatric 
hospitals, initially forming a national health network for women 
and children. 
  Compared with the early days after the founding of New China 
in 1949, the white paper says, the mortality rate for pregnant 
and lying-in women has dropped form 1,500 per hundred thousand 
to about 94.7 per hundred thousand, and the infant mortality 
rate has fallen from 200 per thousand to 31.42 per thousand. 
  It says that the average life expectancy of Chinese women 
has 
risen from 36.7 years in old China to the present 72 years. 
This is three years above the figure for Chinese men and seven 
years higher than the average life expectancy of 65 years set as 
a goal by the United Nations for the women of the world by the 
year 2000. 
  However, the white paper says, the bad habits of arranged 
and 
mercenary marriage linger on in some rural areas, especially in 
the outlying and backward spots. Cases of drowning and 
abandonment of female infants and trafficking in women occur 
from time to time. 
  "The Chinese Government is paying close attention to these 
problems. It is vigorously advocating the equality of the sexes 
and educating women to use legal weapons to defend themselves. 
Strong measures have been adopted against unlawful cruel 
treatment of women to ensure that their legitimate rights and 
interests are not infringed upon."

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- China has taken an 
active part in international women's activities sponsored by the 
United Nations, according to a document released by the 
Information Office of the State Council here today. 
  The white paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women" 
says that China is striving to develop friendly exchanges and 
cooperation with women from all over the world, while making 
unremitting efforts to realize the goal of worldwide equality 
between men and women, women's participation in social 
development and maintenance of world peace. 
  "Since resuming membership in the United Nations in October 
1971, China has shown great enthusiasm in participating in U.N. 
activities related to women," the document states. 
  China has been playing an active role in U.N. women's 
organizations. Since 1974, China has been elected five times as 
a member state in the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. 
"There, Chinese representatives have expounded Chinese women's 
stand on world peace, participation in development and promotion 
of sex equality, exchanged experience and information on 
promoting women's conditions and giving full play to the role of 
women with their counterparts from other countries," the paper 
says. 
  Since 1982, Chinese experts have been elected four times in 
succession as representatives on the Committee on Elimination of 
Discrimination Against Women and participated in evaluating the 
reports submitted by governments and made strenuous efforts to 
eliminate discrimination against women, according to the 
document. 
  The paper says that China was one of the first signatories 
to 
the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination 
against women and has submitted timely reports on its 
implementation in China as required. 
  "China supported and engaged in activities for International 
Women's Year in 1975 and the U.N. Decade for Women, from 1975 to 
1985. The Chinese Government sent delegations to the world 
conferences on women held in Mexico City in 1975, Copenhagen in 
1980 and Nairobi in 1985, and also to the five global 
preliminary meetings and two regional preparatory meetings," the 
document says. 
  "At these events, Chinese representatives gave full support 
to exertions for the United Nations Decade for Women and 
expounded China's stand and viewpoints on some major 
international problems and strategies for the advancement of 
conditions for women, thus making positive contributions to the 
success of these conferences," the paper says. 
  The document continues that Chinese women have made vigorous 
efforts to develop links with women's organizations and 
individuals around the globe. "To date, the All-China Women's 
Federation has established ties with nearly over 480 
governmental and non-governmental women's and children's 
organizations in over 130 countries and regions and received 
more than 10,000 visitors in recent years," it says. 
  In the past 15 years, China has also sent 280 women 
delegations abroad, according to the paper. 
  Over the past decade, the All-China Women's Federation has 
cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund, United 
Nations Women's Development Fund and other governmental and 
non-governmental organizations in over 700 projects in 30 
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Over 300,000 
women have taken part in these programs and the results have 
been outstanding, the paper says. 
  "As the host country of the fourth world conference on 
women," the paper says, "China will make positive efforts to 
ensure its success." 
  "The Chinese Government is at present earnestly carrying out 
its responsibilities as a host country and increasing its 
contacts and cooperation with U.N. organizations, governments 
and relevant non-governmental organizations in the world."

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese women take a 
full part in administering state and social affairs, and have 
made "mammoth contributions" to the country's development of 
democracy and building of its legal system, according to the 
white paper issued by the Information Office of the State 
Council here today. 
  Women in the country have been occupying more and more 
important places in state and social organizations at various 
levels since New China was founded in 1949, says the white paper. 
  It notes that Chinese women occupy an important place in 
people's congresses. When the First National People's Congress 
(NPC) was held in 1954, there were only 147 female deputies, 
accounting for 12 percent of the total. By 1993, when the 
Eighth NPC was convened, the number of women deputies had 
increased to 626, accounting for 21.03 percent of the total. 
  And from 1954 to 1993, eight women served as 
vice-chairperson 
of the NPC Standing Committee, including Soong Ching Ling, He 
Xiangning, Cai Chang and Chen Muhua. 
  The white paper says that women deputies to People's 
Congresses pay particular attention to the problems of education 
and public health, the ecological environment, the protection of 
the rights and interests of women, children and the disabled, 
social security and the general mood of the society. 
  They are active in raising suggestions for legislation and 
policy making and working hard to promote advances in these 
fields. The enactment of the "Law on the Protection of the 
Rights and the Interests of Women" and many other laws were made 
on the basis of motions put forward by women and with their 
participation, the white paper notes. 
  Chinese women also take an active part in the activities of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) 
at various levels. Deng Yingchao, Kang Keqing and Qian 
Zhengying are among the seven women who had served or are still 
serving as chairperson or vice-chairperson of the CPPCC National 
Committee. 
  The Chinese Communist Party has over 7 million women 
members, 
accounting for 14 percent of the general membership. And the 
eight democratic parties in China have some 110,000 women 
members, the report discloses. 
  China's reform and opening to the outside world have 
prepared 
better conditions for women to participate in government and 
political affairs, it says, adding that in 1993, women made up 
32.44 percent of all people working in government organs. 
  At present, the report says, China has 16 female ministers 
and vice-ministers, 18 female provincial governors and deputy 
governors. In the nation's 517 cities, more than 300 women have 
been elected mayor or deputy mayor. 
  In 1992, the country boasted 21,012 female judges and 4,512 
women lawyers, who played an important role in strengthening 
legislative construction and safeguarding state security, the 
paper states. 
  It says that the women's federation at various levels is an 
important channel for the democratic participation and 
supervision over state and social affairs by women of all ethnic 
groups and from all walks of life. 
  The white paper says that the Chinese Communist Party and 
the 
Chinese Government consider the participation of women in 
government and political affairs an important component part of 
the building of democracy in China. 
  The government attaches particular attention to training 
women cadres of ethnic minorities in order to promote equality, 
unity, progress and common prosperity among all ethnic groups. 
  By 1992, the number of minority women cadres nationwide 
reached 607,600, accounting for 26.6 percent of all minority 
cadres in the country, becoming a backbone force in the 
political, economic and social development of minority areas. 
  The white paper says that the Chinese Government is now 
working on "the Program for the Development of Chinese Women," 
which is aimed at further promoting women's participation in 
government and political affairs as well as their overall 
participation and development.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- China's government 
organs, social organizations, enterprises, institutions and 
rural and urban mass groups at the grass roots have all made 
efforts to safeguard the rights and interests of the country's 
women, says a white paper issued by the Information Office of 
the State Council today. 
  Entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women", the white paper 
says that China's people's congresses at all levels are 
responsible for drafting and revising laws and statutes to 
protect women's rights and interests. They supervise the 
implementation of relevant laws and governmental work to 
safeguard the position of women and children. 
  Committees at all echelons of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), it says, carry out democratic 
supervision and provide political consultation on legislations 
concerning women's rights and interests and their implementation. 
  The white paper says that people's governments at each level 
and their departments are responsible for drafting and revising 
women-related administrative regulations, issuing relevant 
decisions and orders, linking women's advance with social 
development, and adopting administrative measures to oversee the 
protection of women's rights and interests. 
  Judicial bodies at all levels, in accordance with legal 
procedures, hear and judge cases and punish criminals who 
infringe on women's rights and interests and see to it that laws 
are upheld, it says. 
  The white paper notes that to coordinate and propel 
governmental departments in their work of guaranteeing the 
rights of women, the State Council has established a work 
committee for women and children. Similar local government 
bodies have also been set up in all the provinces, autonomous 
regions and municipalities, with the exception of Taiwan. 
  It says that more than 5,800 mass women's organizations in 
China are an important force in safeguarding the status of 
women. The biggest of these is the All-China Women's Federation 
(ACWF), which aims to represent and defend the interests of 
women and devotes itself to promoting sexual equality and 
raising women's position in society. 
  The country's mass media, including the press, radio and 
television, publicize state laws and regulations upholding 
women's rights and interests and civilized and progressive views 
on women. This has greatly promoted public awareness of women's 
rights and contributions to society, the white paper says. 
  It lists some of the laws and statutes on the protection of 
women's rights and interests promulgated in recent years, such 
as the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of 
Women, the notice on reprisals against trafficking in women and 
children, the decision on the strict prohibition against 
prostitution and whoring and the decision regarding the severe 
punishment of the criminals who abduct and traffic in or kidnap 
women or children. 
  Female self-improvement is a strategic task fundamental to 
the protection of women's rights and interests, the white paper 
says, adding "the slogan of 'four selfs' (self-respect, 
self-confidence, self-reliance and self-strengthening) was first 
raised at the sixth national congress of women. Then, the 
seventh national congress of women adopted a 10-point goal for 
the advancement of Chinese women in the 1990s. The 'four selfs' 
slogan and the 10-point goal produced a widespread impact upon 
women and society. Inspired by them, millions of Chinese women 
are realizing their own betterment and progress in the course of 
propelling society forward."

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- A white paper issued 
today on the situation of Chinese women says that Chinese women 
have become a great force in the country's social and economic 
development, due to the Chinese Government's fruitful efforts to 
upgrade and enhance their economic status. 
  The 20,000-word white paper states that Chinese women had 
enjoyed equal treatment with men in employment and payment. 
Moreover, all employed women were provided with comprehensive 
protective measures. 
  Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, the 
population of employed women has risen constantly. So far, 
employed females accounted for some 44 percent of the total 
number of employees, higher than the world rate of 34.5 percent. 
  The white paper says that in 1992, employed females made up 
72.33 percent of all women over 15. 
  In the countryside, women laborers made up half the rural 
labor force. The number of urban working women increased from 
600,000 in 1949 to 56 million, while their share of the 
country's total working population went up from 7.5 percent to 
38 percent. 
  The white paper also lists Chinese women's areas of 
employment. It says that among the 12 branches of the national 
economy, nine employed over 1 million women, ranging from 
industry, agriculture, building, transport and communications, 
commerce, public health, education, party and government organs 
to social organizations. 
  The white paper notes that the principle of equal pay for 
equal work for men and women was basically in place. However, 
due to current differences in cultural and professional 
competence as well as occupational composition, income gaps 
still existed. 
  According to a survey conducted in 1990, the average monthly 
incomes for male and female workers in urban areas were 193.15 
yuan and 149.60 yuan respectively, with women receiving only 
77.4 percent of the pay given to men. 
  In rural areas, the average annual incomes for men and women 
were 1,518 yuan and 1,235 yuan respectively, with women getting 
81.4 percent of the earnings of men. 
  In other aspects, the white paper says that the Chinese 
Government had provided comprehensive protective measures for 
employed women. A survey showed that 85.3 percent of 
child-bearing female workers and staff members in urban areas 
enjoy a three-month paid maternity leave. 
  The Chinese Government also stipulated that female workers 
during their pregnant and lactation period have their work load 
and work time reduced. 
  Most state-owned enterprises where women predominate had 
established gynecological clinics, rest rooms for pregnant 
women, breast-feeding rooms, nurseries and kindergartens. 
  As the economic status of Chinese women improves, the white 
paper says, they are playing an increasing significant role in 
the economic sphere. 
  It says that rural women in China were an important driving 
force in invigorating and promoting the rural economy. Females 
accounted for more than half of all workers in agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries and water conservancy. 
  Of the 14 million self-employed rural individuals engaged in 
commerce and service trades, women accounted for about 
one-third. About 50-60 percent of the total rural output value 
was generated by women. 
  The white paper says that in the cities, women had also made 
important contributions to urban economic reform and development. 
  From 1982 to 1990, the growth rate in the number of females 
employed in the following sectors, namely finance, culture and 
education, radio and television, public health, sports and 
recreation, social welfare, commercial concerns, catering, 
supply and storage, and government and social institutions, 
exceeded that of males by 21 to 78 percentage points. 
  In 1993, females accounted for 36.8 percent of those with 
professional and technical titles in enterprises and 
institutions throughout the country.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- New China has brought 
about historic liberation for Chinese women, says the white 
paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women" which is 
published by the Information Office of the State Council here 
today. 
  The white paper says New China effected fundamental 
emancipation for women in all aspects of political, economic, 
cultural, social and family life. This represented a 
significant transformation in the history of contemporary social 
development that China can be proud of and an important 
contribution made by the Chinese revolution to the worldwide 
movement for women's liberation, points out the white paper. 
  In semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China, women were for a 
long time kept at the bottom of society, notes the white paper. 
It was not until the first half of this century that the 
Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to wage a 
profound national democratic revolution and launched a 
large-scale women's emancipation movement which resulted in the 
historic liberation of Chinese women. 
  The white paper says the impact of the several millennia of 
oppression and devastation imposed by the feudal patriarchal 
system on Chinese women was exceptionally grave. In political, 
economic, cultural, social and family life, women were 
considered inferior to men. They possessed no political rights 
and were completely excluded from social and political life. 
They were economically dependent and were robbed of property 
and inheritance rights and possessed no independent source of 
income. They had no personal dignity or independent status, and 
were deprived of the right to receive an education and take part 
in social activities, according to the white paper. 
  Ever since its birth, says the white paper, the Chinese 
Communist Party has made the achievement of female emancipation 
and equality between men and women one of its goals. 
  For the women of China, the founding of the People's 
Republic 
of China ended the thousands of years of feudal oppression and 
enslavement and the history of being trampled and bullied by 
foreign aggressors, stresses the white paper. With an entirely 
new face, they have stood up and become the masters of New China 
like all citizens of the country, the white paper says. 
  In 1949, the common program, adopted by the First Plenary 
Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference which had the nature of a provisional constitution, 
solemnly declared the toppling of the feudal system which 
fettered women and stated that women enjoyed equal rights with 
men in the political, economic, cultural and educational fields 
and in other aspects of social life. Thus a new era in the 
emancipation of Chinese women was ushered in, the white paper 
points out. 
  The Electoral Law of the People's Republic of China 
promulgated in 1953 also clearly stipulated that women enjoy the 
same rights to vote and stand for election as men. 
  Along with the economic rehabilitation and development, 
there 
appeared a nationwide upsurge of women stepping out of their 
homes to take part in social production. This thoroughly 
transformed the situation in which women were excluded from 
social productive labor, providing them with an independent 
source of income, says the white paper. 
  According to the white paper, in old China, as many as 90 
percent of women were illiterate. In order to raise the 
cultural level of the entire nation, New China launched a 
planned campaign to gradually wipe out illiteracy. Millions of 
women attended the campaign. 
  The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, 
promulgated in 1950, was the first statute enacted by New China. 
It declared the abolition of the feudal marriage system 
characterized by arranged and forced marriage, male superiority 
and female inferiority, and disregard for the interests of 
children. 
  Implementation of the new system was marked by freedom for 
both men and women in marriage, monogamy, sexual equality and 
protection of the legitimate rights of women and children. This 
signified a profound revolution in the patterns of wedded and 
family life that had prevailed for several thousand years in 
Chinese society, states the white paper.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The first batch of 
foreign academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 
the country's top scientific body, is expected to be selected 
within a week, official sources said here today. 
  This was revealed at a news conference on the imminent 
seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences (CAS) and the inaugural meeting of a new Chinese 
Academy of Engineering (CAE). 
  A CAS spokesman said that the foreign academicians will be 
selected from some 25 foreign scientists recommended to the 
academy. 
  The two meetings are due to be held here from June 3 to June 
8. 
  This will be a grand gathering for the country's scientific, 
technological and engineering communities, the spokesman said. 
  "The opening of the two meetings of academicians will 
certainly arouse the attention and interest of all social 
sections, particularly the scientific and technological 
communities both at home and abroad," the spokesman said, adding 
that the two meetings will have a far-reaching impact on the 
country's development of science and technology. 
  He said that a change of rules on CAS academicians is 
expected to be passed during the meeting, adding that currently 
China has 535 CAS academicians. 
  He said that leading officials from the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council will 
speak at the meeting. 
  He said that thanks to the concern of the Central Committee 
of the CPC and the State Council, the preparations for the 
founding of the CAE have been accomplished, and the inaugural 
ceremony, namely the first meeting of the academicians, will be 
held during the CAS meeting. 
  Ninety-six people have been appointed as the first 
academicians of the CAE. The list will be made public on June 
3, the spokesman said. 
  He attributed the relatively small number of initial CAE 
academicians to the fact that the official preparations for the 
establishment of the academy were not started until January. 
  But a second batch of CAE academicians will be chosen from a 
nationwide selection after the meeting, the spokesman said. 
  He added that the president and deputy president of the CAE 
will be selected from its academicians at this session.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Ai Xiao (5337 4562): "Our Country Will </F>
Vigorously Pursue Health Education in the Face of the Invasion 
of AIDS"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 31 May (RENMIN RIBAO)-- Faced with the 
invasion of AIDS, China will launch a vigorous health education 
campaign as a major preventive and control measure against the 
disease. At the three-day "seminar on the prevention and 
control of AIDS in China" jointly held by the State Council 
Research Office and Ministry of Public Health that begins today, 
studies by expert and academic research groups will be presented 
and examined in preparation for a formal submission of a 
"proposal on the prevention of AIDS in China." 
  Globally 400,000 AIDS cases -- half of which occurred in the 
United States -- were recorded between June 1985, when the 
world's first case was reported, and the early 1990's. Dramatic 
changes occurred in the mid-1990's when the spread of AIDS in 
developing countries exceeded that in the United States. A 
conservative estimate by the WHO projected that, by 2000, 50 
million people around the world will have been exposed to the 
HIV virus, most of them in countries and regions such as Asia, 
Africa, and Latin America. 
  It has been learned that a total of 118 new AIDS cases were 
reported in 10 provinces and cities between January and May. A 
total of 1,361 AIDS cases have been recorded in 22 mainland 
provinces and cities (1,106 patients are mainland residents, and 
255 are foreigners and overseas Chinese) and 40 of these 
carriers have developed full-blown AIDS (22 of them have died). 
The figures, however, came only from small-range tests of less 
than 3 million people. 
  State Councillor Peng Peiyun; Wu Jieping, National People's 
Congress Standing Committee vice chairman; Qian Zhengying, 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice 
chairman; Yuan Mu, State Council Research Office director; 
Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang; among others attended 
today's seminar.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- Passengers who use 
China's civil air service please take note: According to a 
circular issued recently by the Civil Aviation Administration of 
China [CAAC], no unit or individual is allowed to coerce 
passengers to buy flight insurance of any kind. 
  For some time, some civic aviation departments or ticket 
offices have insisted that passengers buy various insurances in 
violation of the principle of voluntary participation. The 
passengers complained bitterly about this. The CAAC circular 
pointed out that it is strictly forbidden to refuse to sell 
tickets or handle passenger check-in or cargo shipping 
procedures for passengers or shippers who have not bought 
personal, luggage, or cargo insurance. Ticketing departments 
(including agents) must, on principle, have separate windows for 
handling regular ticket sales and for insurance sales. If they 
are sold at the same window, the words "passenger insurance 
voluntary" and the insurance premium should be written on the 
window in plain sight. Violation of the aforementioned 
stipulations is punishable by a fine of 20,000 yuan in pursuance 
with relevant regulations and the violator will be criticized in 
the form of a circular.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Glorious Obligation, A Common </F>
Duty--Commemorating 10th Anniversary of Promulgation of PRC 
Conscription Law"] 
  [Text] Today we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 
promulgation of the PRC Conscription Law with the aim of making 
everyone understand that enlisting in the armed forces according 
to this law is the glorious obligation of every citizen and that 
showing concern for and supporting national defense construction 
is the common duty of the entire society. 
  The Conscription Law now in force was reformulated and 
promulgated in light of China's new situation of reform, opening 
up, and economic construction. Practice has proved that this 
military service law prominently characterized by a military 
service system which takes compulsory service as the main 
component while integrating compulsory and voluntary service and 
militia and reserve service, corresponds with China's national 
and military conditions. It bears outstanding Chinese 
characteristics and is thus warmly supported by the people of 
all nationalities in the country and the commanders and soldiers 
of the entire armed forces. In the last 10 years, all 
localities have conscientiously implemented the Conscription 
Law; have made efforts for the fulfillment of enlistments in 
military service, militia, and reserve forces; have done well in 
providing special care for disabled soldiers and their families; 
and have effectively supported national defense construction as 
well as the building up of the armed forces. In particular, 
with regard to work concerning military service, all localities 
have strengthened their leadership, enthusiastically conducted 
propagation and education on the Conscription Law, actively 
formulated and improved local conscription regulations, and paid 
close attention to improving the personnel contingent involved 
in conscription work, thus reliably ensuring the quality of new 
recruits. The saying "when a family member joins the armed 
forces the whole family is honored" prevails in society. 
Officers and men of the Liberation Army and the Armed Police 
Force, in accordance with the provisions of the Conscription 
Law, have performed their duties in a trustworthy manner and 
trained hard for better military skills, thus making prominent 
contributions to defending the country as well as to 
safeguarding and supporting socialist modernization. The militia 
and reserve forces have taken an active part in military 
training, performed tactical duties, and played an important 
role in maintaining social stability and carrying out the two 
civilizations. These remarkable jobs have effectively promoted 
national defense construction and the armed forces buildup. 
  In the new situation of deepening reform and establishing 
the 
socialist market economy structure, better implementation of the 
Conscription Law has important, practical bearings on 
strengthening the people's national defense awareness, on 
improving their consciousness in joining the armed forces 
according to the law, and on carrying forward the spirit of 
patriotism and revolutionary heroism. How should we properly 
implement the Conscription Law? We should first rely on the 
legal system and secondly on education. At present, we should 
change our concepts and work style and transform the habit of 
working mainly by administrative means under the planned economy 
structure into the habit of working mainly by legal means under 
the socialist market economy structure. This is to ensure 
national defense construction and the building up of the armed 
forces. The Conscription Law is a basic law in China's military 
system and serves as an important legal basis for national 
defense construction and the building up of the armed forces. 
In the course of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, all localities and armed forces units should continue 
to propagate and implement the Conscription Law so that we can 
abide by this law in national defense construction and building 
up the armed forces and embark on the track of the legal system. 
  Strengthening national defense education and improving the 
people's national defense mentality are the ideological basis 
for implementing the Conscription Law properly. In recent 
years, localities have introduced various methods in 
strengthening national defense education and improving the 
people's national defense mentality. This has played an 
important role in promoting the implementation of the 
Conscription Law. However, we should also understand that 
because efforts are being concentrated on socialist 
modernization, and because of the prolonged period of peace, 
particularly in this new situation when the socialist market 
economic structure is being established, some people's national 
defense mentality has weakened to such an extent that they 
cannot correctly handle the relationship between economic 
construction and national defense construction or the 
relationship between individual interests, collective interests, 
and state interests. Therefore, we should, in light of specific 
conditions and with the purposes in mind, conduct education on 
national defense, on joining the armed forces, and on patriotism 
among cadres, masses, officers, soldiers, militiamen, and 
personnel of the reserve forces. This education will enable 
everyone to understand the basic provisions of the Conscription 
Law; understand that strengthening the building up of the armed 
forces and improving national defense are important aspects of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; understand that 
economic construction is the basis of national defense 
construction, whereas national defense construction serves as a 
guarantee for economic construction and that the two are 
complementary to each other; and understand that without the 
country, there would not be a home and that individual and 
collective interests should be subordinated to the state's 
interests. Everyone should know that national defense mentality 
is an important manifestation of patriotism. In propagating 
patriotism and a spirit of selfless devotion, the people should 
strengthen their national defense mentality and consciously and 
actively fulfill their military service obligations. In short, 
if a good job is done in national defense education and 
improving the people's national defense mentality, a fine 
atmosphere will be created in which the entire society will care 
for and support national defense construction and building up 
the armed forces and all officers and soldiers will devote 
themselves to national defense construction. 
  Let us hold high the banner of patriotism; further study, 
propagate, and implement the Conscription Law; and make greater 
contributions to strengthening national defense construction and 
the building up of the armed forces.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (CNS) -- Top officials from some 
ten ministries and commissions participated in the first 
conference on comprehensive coordination of the economy 
sponsored by the State Economic and Trade Commission. They had 
discussions on new features of the market economy in order to 
strengthen comprehensive coordination of the economic operation. 
A decision made in the conference stated that a system is to be 
set up for the holding of conference to achieve such an end. 
  Following analysis and review of the current economic 
situation in China, participants pointed out that much work 
should be done with emphasis on "comprehensiveness" and 
"coordination". The national economy should be kept at 
continuous, rapid and healthy development through means of 
timely regulation of the economic operation. 
  The conference concluded that work should be done to 
strengthen and improve comprehensiveness and coordination of 
economic operation. First, establishment of the socialist 
market economy system is necessary. It is rather complicated in 
the economic operation during the transition period when the new 
system replaces the old one. Old problems resulting from the 
planned economy system were uncovered while new ones appeared 
under the new situation, all of which should be seriously dealt 
with. A large workload to cover so many sectors with emphasis 
on coordination is expected. Quality of such coordinated work 
is directly related to the reform and development as a whole. 
  Second, it is necessary to have macro-economic regulation 
further strengthened and improved. Serious fluctuation in the 
economic development can be prevented by means of implementation 
of policies on timely regulation of economic operation. 
  Third, problems facing the current economic situation 
involved such fields as production, transport, internal trade 
and foreign trade as well as many departments. It is difficult 
to get them solved just by one individual department, and 
comprehensive and coordinated efforts have to be made to solve 
them. 
  Officials from Ministries of Metallurgy, Coal, Electronics, 
Machine-building, Chemistry, Geology and Mineral Resources, 
Railways, Communications, Internal Trade as well as Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation plus the China Light Industry 
Council, the China Textile Industry Council, the State 
Administration of Taxation and the State Statistical Bureau, the 
General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China and the General Office of the State Council attended 
the conference.

<F P=106> [By reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] </F>
  [Text] Wuxi, 31 May (XINHUA) -- At a national work 
conference on the technical transformation held here today, Xu 
Penghang, vice minister in charge of the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, said: The principal problems revealed in 
China's economic operations are overinvestment in fixed assets, 
conspicuous structural contradictions, outdated equipment in 
some state-owned enterprises, backwardness in technology, 
single-product production, and weak competitiveness in the 
market. To change these conditions, it is necessary to invest 
more in the technical transformation in state-owned enterprises, 
step up the pace of transformation, and take the road of 
developing extended reproduction, on the basis of the existing 
scale. 
  Xu Penghang said: To encourage technical progress in 
enterprises, the state has, in the past, implemented a series of 
preferential policies for enterprises, like putting fish in a 
suitable place to breed, and it has positively promoted 
technical progress in enterprises. Under the new circumstances, 
however, we can no longer rely on tax breaks and benefits 
granted to upgrade technology for enterprises; instead, we 
should transform enterprise operating mechanisms, strive to 
strengthen their capacity, actively adopt new technologies and 
techniques, improve the level of management and overall quality 
of enterprises, and practice a system of fair competition to 
keep the superior and eliminate the inferior. To this end, the 
State Economic and Trade Commission will select a group of 
enterprises with favorable conditions to engage in a number of 
high-level technical transformation projects, so as to amass the 
limited capital to upgrade key industries and enterprises. We 
should consider the overall situation in approaching this issue; 
while supporting some key state enterprises, we should also 
guide the "leading sheep" among collective enterprises, village 
and town enterprises, and other economies to cultivate new 
economic growth points. 
  Xu Penghang said: Following the launch of measures for 
reforming the financial and taxation, banking, foreign exchange, 
and investment systems, the sources of capital for technical 
transformations in enterprises have increased, bodies have 
cooperated in investing, and the modes of investment have been 
diversified. Taking the year 1993 as an example, of the 
investments in the state's two technical transformation 
projects, each of which was worth hundreds of million of yuan, 
only 1.1 percent of the total investment was from the state 
budget, 35.5 percent was from domestic loans, 3.8 percent was 
from foreign funds, 53.2 percent was from self-raised capital, 
and 6.4 percent was from other investments. Capital raised by 
enterprises themselves and foreign funds have become an 
important source of investment in the technical transformation. 
Because the power of examining and approving investment 
projects is delegated to the lower authorities, state-owned, 
collective, village, and town enterprises and a variety of 
economic entities have gradually become investing bodies. As 
for the modes of investment, more and more projects are jointly 
invested in by the central and local authorities, two or more 
localities, governments and enterprises, or enterprises and 
foreign businesses. 
  It has been learned that in the first three years of the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan period, China has altogether invested 
467.9 billion yuan in the technical transformation, thus 
exceeding the total investment in the five years of the Seventh 
Five-Year Plan period. Thanks to the state's attention to the 
technical transformation in enterprises and investment in energy 
resources, undersupplied raw and semifinished materials 
industries, transportation, and telecommunications, the 
limitations caused by the "bottleneck" industries have been 
alleviated to some extent. Meanwhile, the state's vigorous 
support of the technical transformation for export-oriented 
enterprises engaged in processing industries has increased the 
textile industry's foreign exchange earnings by $1 billion; a 
significant increase has also been seen in light industry, 
electronics, and machine building. In addition, the technical 
equipment produced by a number of key industries -- products 
such as video recorders, textile machines, air conditioner 
compressors, and automobile engines -- have become highly 
indigenous, thanks to the import of technologies, the technical 
transformation, and technological development.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A research 
report released recently by the China State Statistical Bureau's 
Industry and Communications Department discloses that the role 
of the "growth rate effect" as a special characteristic of 
China's industrial economy has decreased in recent years in the 
wake of the deepening of reform. A review of the internal and 
external factors regulating economic returns shows that "market 
inflexibility syndrome" on part of enterprises has emerged as a 
major factor. 
  The newspaper ZHONGGUO XINXI BAO run by the State 
Statistical 
Bureau carried a report on this recently. The said research 
report maintains that in recent years, in the wake of the full 
progress of the reform of the economic structure on all fronts 
and the enforcement of the relevant regulations, the regulatory 
function of market mechanisms has increased every day. An 
investigation conducted in 1991 by the department concerned into 
the cause of losses in 50 enterprises in the three cities of 
Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin revealed that three categories of 
factors--those related to policies, macroeconomic operations, 
and enterprise operations and management were responsible for 
19.4, 47.8, and 32.8 percent of the cases respectively. Another 
investigation conducted last year by the department concerned 
into the cause of losses in more than 2,500 enterprises in eight 
provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin, 
showed that the number of cases due to factors related to 
policies and macroeconomic operations had both been reduced to 
around 9 percent, whereas the number of cases due to factors 
related to enterprise operations and management had risen 
drastically to 82 percent. This change indicates that poor 
management and market inflexibility on the part of enterprises 
themselves have emerged as the major factors affecting their 
economic returns.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (CNS) -- Improvement was made by 
state-owned enterprises during the first quarter of this year, 
according to Mr. Wang Zhongyu, Minister of the State Economic 
and Trade Commission. 
  With implementation of reform measures for finance, 
taxation, 
monetary system and foreign exchange, the new system proceeded 
normally, said Mr. Wang. He added that work on the state-owned 
enterprises would have to be strengthened. Emphasis had to be 
put on improvement of the enterprise mechanism while practice 
concerning bankruptcy on a trial basis, clearance of debt, 
supplement of capital at one's own disposal, restrictions on 
production of particular items for prevention of stockpiling, 
turning loss into profit and improvement of administration of 
enterprises had to be carried out. 
  At a conference sponsored recently by the Commission on 
comprehensive coordination of economic operation, participants 
expressed great concern for the state-owned enterprises. 
  Mr. Wang said that enterprises which came to a halt in 
production or saw inadequate working hours generally made up 10 
percent of the total across the country. Of the enterprises, 
those which stopped production accounted for four percent. As 
state-owned enterprises followed the international accounting 
system, some expenses in the past considered part of spending 
related to profit made by enterprises is now regarded as 
production cost, leading to a drop of profit in the account 
book. Actual profit made by state-owned enterprises, according 
to Mr. Wang, however, registered a gain and the loss reduced to 
some extent. 
  When regarding to appraisal of state-owned enterprises, Mr. 
Wang said that this should be seen with the following three 
points in minds. First, state-owned enterprises took a turn for 
the better in the wake of preferential measures for them and 
efforts made by the Party committees and governments at various 
levels as well as by enterprises themselves. 
  Second, great attention had to be paid to some enterprises 
suffering from poor quality products and difficulties in selling 
them. Solution to these problems had to be seriously looked 
into, but time and necessary conditions were needed for 
solutions. 
  Third, as state-owned enterprises had great vitality, 
therefore prospect for those enterprises was very promising.

3057 3932): "Number One Automobile Group Steadily Pursues 
Improved Production Method"] 
  [Text] When you visit Number One Automobile, you will 
discover that its workshops have changed a lot. The spare parts 
and components which are stacked up in ordinary plants are not 
found there. One person operates several machines. Inspectors 
and repairmen go to and fro on the spot ready to solve problems 
right away. Plaques giving production instructions in the 
workshop are written tidily..... This is what they have become 
since adopting an improved production method. 
  In recent years, in order to give priority to improving 
economic returns in the course of modernizing enterprise, the 
Number One Auto Group has enhanced its competitiveness in the 
market, boldly reformed its traditional method of flow mass 
production, and gradually and thoroughly introduced an improved 
method of production. 
  The improved production method is a unique one created by 
Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation in the 30 years since the 
1950's and is considered another revolution in management 
following the "mass production method" created in the United 
States in the early 1920's. Its goal is to continuously reduce 
costs and waste and achieve zero stocks, product variety, and 
the maximization of economic returns with the fewest inputs. 
Today, economically developed countries around the world, 
especially in the auto industry, are learning and promoting this 
production method. 
  Number One Automobile began to adopt the improved production 
method in the company itself in 1992. First, they chose five 
special plants, nine workshops, and three production lines with 
different technological status, processing methods, and pace of 
production for experimentation. After adopting the improved 
production method for one year, the jack shaft plant doubled its 
originally planned production, increasing its labor productivity 
by nearly 100 percent. In the first year of pursuing the 
improved production method, Changchun's gear plant found its 
output value had increased by 44 percent, labor productivity by 
37 percent, and per capita profits by 25 percent over the 
previous year. 
  After obtaining experience, the company, trying to make a 
breakthrough in production management, reformed its traditional 
mass production method: 
  They achieved "one-flow" production by changing the original 
phased-push process to a successive one-phase process, thus 
greatly reducing stocks between processes, reducing the amount 
of circulating funds used, improving processing quality, and 
greatly reducing waste. 
  They succeeded in reducing the number of production workers 
and achieved full capacity by having one person operate several 
machines rather than one machine as in the past, thus greatly 
improving production efficiency. 
  They changed the original large-scale production with a 
small 
number of batches to small-scale production with a large number 
of batches, thus facilitating the organization of varied 
production, saving warehouse space, and reducing rotating 
workloads. 
  They changed the original delivery of stocks to just-in-time 
delivery, thus smoothing production and maintaining orderly 
on-site production. 
  By adopting improved production, Number One Automobile has 
already obtained preliminary results and its economic returns 
have obviously improved. In 1993, its sales income increased by 
45 percent over the previous year and profits and income 
increased by 53 percent, and many of its economic and 
technological indicators reached historic highs. Moreover, this 
improved production method has also been integrated with reform 
of the labor, wage distribution, and social security systems. 
Staff numbers have been reduced and have shown negative growth, 
and the enterprise has become "slim." A hot wave of "building a 
factory with improved production" has now surged in Number One 
Automobile, where leaders pay close attention to improving 
methods, staff and workers emphasize improved methods, and 
everyone stresses work improvement.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "There Is a Gold Mine in Every </F>
Enterprise"] 
  [Text] It is difficult for one to understand very well the 
news about Number One Automobile if one is unfamiliar with 
economic management. However, the question it has raised, 
namely, demanding efficiency from management, is very important 
and specific. 
  State-owned enterprises must change their management 
mechanism. But a change of management mechanism cannot replace 
the strengthening and improvement of management. In order to 
make profits and avoid losses, management is essential. 
  Enterprises must pay attention to technological 
transformation. But technological transformation cannot replace 
the strengthening and improvement of management either. Without 
corresponding management, modern technology and equipment cannot 
play their roles very well. 
  Many enterprises always complain that they do not have 
enough 
funds and always ask for help from banks to solve their 
problems. But strengthening and improving management can not 
only dispense with capital inputs, it can even save large 
amounts of funds and under these circumstances improve returns 
and obtain funds. Why do we not make great efforts to use this 
method? 
  Successful enterprises in the developed countries do not 
ignore management. Between the late 1980's and the early 
1990's, a great change took place in the global automobile 
market. American cars, which had played a dominant role earlier, 
were continuously affected and threatened by Japanese cars, not 
only in Japan, but also in other parts of the world and even in 
North America. International commentators generally held that 
as far as overall technological expertise was concerned, Japan 
still lagged behind the United States, but Japanese management 
was superior. The United States was not happy with its failure. 
Americans organized forces to study their competitors. An 
organization called the "National Automobile Plan" spent five 
years on investigation and research. It made a scientific 
exposition and conclusion of the production methods introduced 
by Japan's Toyota Corporation and called it the "improved 
production method." They held that if all of the industrialized 
countries generally adopted this production method, the world 
would change. They wrote their research results in a book and 
published as the The Machine Which Changed the World. 
  These facts show that in the world today, enterprises around 
the world not only compete in markets and through technology, 
but also compete acutely in management. What is precious about 
Number One Automobile is that it has already clearly seen this 
modern wave and has boldly thrown itself into this wave to 
compete. 
  At present, China's enterprise management does not meet the 
needs of the market economy or the needs of modern large-scale 
production. The contradiction is rather noticeable. The Number 
One Automobile Group's practice offers us a convincing example 
of demanding efficiency from management. Their leaders, staff, 
and workers have already experienced the benefits of it. A 
certain worker jubilantly exclaimed: "There is a gold mine 
beneath my feet. The tool to mine the gold with is the improved 
production method!" In fact, there is a mine in many 
enterprises. Although they do not appear to be able to use the 
improved production method immediately, they should always 
proceed from reality, keep high standards, use better management 
methods, and dig out the gold.

  [Text] Nanjing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Xiao Qing, a young 
teacher at Nanjing No. 20 middle school, was very cross when she 
was told by a studio assistant that a color film containing 
pictures she had taken together with her husband during their 
honeymoon had been lost. 
  For half a year, she complained about her loss to the studio 
executives and the relevant departments in charge of the studio, 
but without avail. 
  On April 5, 1993, she brought a lawsuit through a local 
court 
for protecting consumers' legitimate rights and interests. The 
court is part of the People's Court of Qinhuai District in 
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province. 
  She demanded that the studio apologize to her and compensate 
her for her loss. 
  She did not know then that her case would become the first 
case handled by China's first court for protecting consumers' 
rights and interests. 
  During the court hearing, the studio apologized to Xiao 
Qing. 
Mediated by the court, it agreed to pay her 500 yuan in 
compensation for her loss. 
  Since its establishment in March 1993, the court for 
protecting consumers' rights and interests has handled nearly 
200 cases, according to Wang Dianyou, president of the Qinhuai 
District People's Court. 
  Wang said that these cases involved a wide range of disputes 
between buyers and sellers concerning the quality of goods, such 
as a fur-lined coat costing several thousand yuan and a pair of 
shoes costing about ten yuan. 
  He said that the court had made decisions on a small number 
of cases and had mediated in the rest. 
  "With our help, some disputes are resolved easily," he said. 
  For instance, a woman complained to the court that a skirt 
made by a tailor was too tight for her, but the tailor refused 
to alter it or give her compensation. 
  The dispute was resolved within two hours, with mediation by 
a court official. The tailor agreed to either compensate her or 
make her a new skirt. 
  Some owners of private shops refused to refund consumers 
even 
if their goods were found shoddy, Wang said. 
  But when a court official arrived at such shops, none of the 
owners would refuse to refund consumers, he added. 
  Wang said: "The court for protecting consumers' rights and 
interests must speak and act on behalf of consumers. I think it 
should enable the people to have a place to give vent to their 
grievances." 
  The court also provides consultancy services to local 
consumers, as well as consumers in the Daqing Oilfield in 
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the island 
Province of Hainan in south China, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186): "Rights </F>
and Interests Are Not Costs--Report on the Question of 
Labor-Capital Relations in Foreign-Funded Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Thoughts on 61 Young People 
  In December last year, following the extraordinarily large 
fire on 19 November in Shenzhen, another major fire broke out at 
the Gaofu Company in Mawei, Fuzhou, in which 61 teenage girl 
workers were burned to death. The arsonist, surnamed Dong, who 
had been dismissed by the company for theft, pleaded guilty and 
was executed. However, more and more people are beginning to 
wonder: Why did the arsonist take such an extreme action of 
revenge? Why did so many innocent people lose their lives when 
the accident occurred? 
  A person in charge of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions pointed out penetratingly: The fires in Mawei and 
Shenzhen have fully exposed some problems in the labor-capital 
relations of foreign-invested enterprises, such as the 
intensification of labor-capital contradictions, the indifferent 
attitude toward production safety, and so on. These problems 
are attracting extensive attention from various circles of 
society. 
  Labor-capital relations are also called labor relations. 
They refer to the various kinds of relations between the 
possessors and users of labor, which involve the interests of 
the laborers, such as working conditions, wages and other 
remuneration, labor insurance, and so on. It cannot be denied 
that foreign-invested enterprises have provided more jobs and 
have established a new mode of labor relations for us. On the 
whole, most foreign-invested enterprises can operate according 
to the law, and their labor-capital relations are relatively 
stable. However, recent surveys show that there really are 
problems in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of 
staff members and workers in some foreign-invested enterprises. 
This is even more conspicuous in some medium and small-labor 
intensive enterprises invested by ROK, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and 
Japanese businessmen. The problems are manifested in: 
  --The system of using laborers. Some foreign-invested 
enterprises privately and indiscriminately recruit laborers 
(including child laborers), dismiss them at will, do not sign 
contracts with staff members or workers, and replace contracts 
with "factory rules" of a domestic disciplinary nature, so that 
the employment of the staff members and workers is not 
guaranteed. Even if contracts are signed, the contracts are not 
standardized. They contain only "responsibilities" and do not 
contain "rights and interests," or they contain inappropriate 
clauses which are imposed on workers. In Shantou, Zhuhai, and 
Fuzhou, more than 70 percent of foreign-invested enterprises 
have not signed contracts with workers. The Chinese and English 
versions of the contract of a certain major restaurant in 
Shanghai are entirely different, so that the restaurant can use 
the contract "to deal with" the staff members and workers at any 
time. 
  --Wages and other remuneration. It is only right that the 
income of staff members and workers of foreign-invested 
enterprises should be higher, but, in reality, this is not true 
of all such enterprises. According to a survey on 75 
foreign-invested enterprises in three special economic zones in 
Guangdong, the number of enterprises whose minimum wages for 
workers are below the minimum wage standard set by local 
governments is 41, accounting for 55 percent of the total. The 
minimum wages of 17 of these enterprises are below 200 yuan, and 
the lowest are only 140 yuan. Some enterprises have illegally 
lowered, reduced, delayed the payment of, or absorbing the 
remuneration for the workers' labor. They, for example, have 
made it a rule that two days' wages should be reduced for making 
a mistake in punching time cards and one day's wages should be 
reduced for going to the toilet without a permit, and so on. A 
Macao contractor of the Zhuhai Huahui Toy Plant fled outside the 
border after embezzling and absorbing workers' wages amounting 
to 1.4 million yuan. In 1992 alone, foreign-invested 
enterprises in Shenzhen delayed the payment of workers' wages 
amounting to more than 3.2 million yuan. 
  --Labor time. A considerable number of foreign-invested 
enterprises have asked workers to work extra shifts or extra 
hours. These workers universally work 10-12 hour days, and they 
seldom have days off. Their overtime pay is very little, 
usually 0.5-1.0 yuan an hour. In several foreign-invested 
enterprises in Guangdong, the workers have had no holidays for 
11 months running, and the workers sometimes work as long as 36 
hours at a stretch. Some foreign businessmen have purposely set 
very high quotas for the workers and have set very low payment 
for each piece of a product. As a result, the workers are 
compelled to work long hours -- some have fainted at their 
machine tools because they could not cope with the excessive 
workload. Some foreign-invested enterprises simply ignore the 
new work hour system which was promulgated not long ago. 
  --Labor protection. Some foreign businessmen have 
increased labor intensity, shifted high-pollution and obsolete 
industries to the mainland, and ignored safety and sanitation. 
Consequently, the labor conditions are very poor, and incidents 
leading to injuries and deaths often occur. In a 400-worker 
company solely owned by a foreign businessman in Xiamen, 40 
workers have had their fingers squashed in four years since the 
company was established, because the machines of the company 
have no protective devices. Many medium and small enterprises 
do not have ventilation devices or toxic gas discharge devices. 
Their working environment is dark and damp, and more and more 
workers have suffered from occupational diseases. Some 
enterprises (such as the Gaofu Company) have located their 
workshops, storehouses, dormitories, and canteens all in one 
place. Even passageways are full of goods, the gates of plants 
are locked, and production is carried out in sealed-off areas. 
In the event an accident occurs, the staff members and workers 
cannot escape. 
  --Insurance and welfare. Some foreign-invested enterprises 
have evaded their due responsibility for the social security of 
staff members and workers. In some localities, the insurance 
coverage of foreign-invested enterprises is very limited. Some 
of these enterprises have refused to provide pensions, medical 
insurance, and accident insurance for workers and have not duly 
provided welfare services for workers. In particular, women 
workers, who account more than half of the total number of 
workers in foreign-invested enterprises, are seldom given 
reasonable maternity leave, and some have even been dismissed 
during their pregnancy or after giving birth to a child. A 
Taiwanese businessman once said with a straight face: "Do you 
not talk about `to each according to his work'? How can I pay 
her if she wants to give birth to a child and does not work?" 
  --Personal rights. Some foreign-invested enterprises do not 
respect staff members or workers. Their ways of management are 
rough and brutal, and they even mete out corporal punishment to 
workers, beat them, curse them, and insult them. Some 
enterprises have established rules forbidding workers to drink 
water or to go to the toilet during work hours. They even 
illegally make body searches of workers. 
  Since the legitimate rights and interests of staff members 
and workers have been repeatedly infringed upon, the number of 
labor-capital conflicts and labor disputes have increased. 
<H5>  Is This Simply a Management Issue? </H5>
  The reason why these problems have emerged in the 
labor-capital relations in foreign-invested enterprises is that, 
on the one hand, the capital side of some enterprises have 
concentrated on seeking higher profits, have made serious 
mistakes in their short-term behavior, are not willing to make 
necessary inputs in labor conditions, have ignored the relevant 
laws and regulations, and have one-sidedly stressed "employment 
relations," thus causing various hidden troubles and undesirable 
effects. On the other hand, local governments have a biased 
understanding of the investment environment, have paid much 
attention to introducing foreign capital, equipment, and 
technology while neglecting management, and have excessively 
tolerated acts of infringement upon the rights and interests of 
staff members and workers of the Chinese side, thus making it 
difficult for the judicial departments to smoothly carry out 
their work. 
  As a matter of fact, foreign-invested enterprises must abide 
by local laws and regulations no matter which countries they are 
located in. Only this conforms with international norms. The 
crux of the issue is whether our legal system concerning labor 
is sound. 
  Some comrades from the Ministry of Labor have said: China 
has been implementing the reform and opening up policy for more 
than a decade and has obtained remarkable results in introducing 
capital, technology, and advanced management techniques. 
However, the building of the legal system where work is 
concerned has failed to meet the needs of the development of the 
situation. The departments concerned have formulated and 
promulgated a series of rules and regulations on labor 
management involving foreigners, but most of them only have 
administrative effects, not legal effects. Moreover, these 
rules and regulations were drafted in the 1980's, and they 
embody provisions which safeguard the rights and interests of 
the investors more than those of the staff members and workers 
of the Chinese side. In particular, since some great changes 
have been made in the labor system of state-owned enterprises, 
provisions on foreign-invested enterprises have evidently been 
inappropriate. The fact that legislation has lagged behind has 
led to a lax enforcement of the law. Some localities have 
simply used rules and regulations only as a reference, and 
foreign businessmen have made use of the loopholes. 
  Besides, the strength of trade unions in foreign-invested 
enterprises is still quite weak. According to incomplete 
statistics, by the end of last year, of the more than 80,000 
foreign-invested enterprises which have been put into operation 
or production, about 8,000 have set up trade unions, accounting 
for only 10 percent of the total. Director Tian of the 
Grass-roots Work Department of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions said that most of the foreign-invested enterprises where 
labor-capital disputes occur do not have organized trade unions. 
Some foreign businessmen have regarded trade unions as their 
opposites and have stood in the way of the establishment of 
trade unions. Some trade union cadres have been dismissed for 
defending the rights and interests of staff members and workers, 
and others are in an "underground" state. The workers from some 
foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen and other cities have 
spontaneously organized "associations of fellow townsmen" and 
"federations of workers." However, whenever major labor 
disputes occur, these non-trade union organizations often adopt 
radical measures which exacerbate the labor-capital relations. 
  The sense of self-protection is also very weak among the 
staff members and workers of foreign-invested enterprises. Most 
of them come from rural areas, and their cultural quality is not 
high. They are eager to make money and do not know how to 
defend their own interests and dignity. A female worker was 
slapped twice by her boss for no reason at all. The next day, 
the boss gave her 50 yuan wrapped in red paper and the other 
female workers watched with admiration. Several workers in 
Shekou were compelled to work overtime in midsummer. They fell 
ill and were dismissed at once, and each was given only 100 yuan 
for working in the heat of summer. These workers shed grateful 
tears. We cannot but feel "pity for their misfortune, and angry 
at their lack of protest." 
<H5>  What Should We Do? </H5>
  In the course of making this report, we deeply feel that 
harmonious and stable labor-capital relations are important 
conditions for ensuring social stability and the healthy 
development of investment made by foreign businessmen. Of 
course, foreign businessmen should be allowed to make money, and 
the legitimate rights and interests of laborers should also be 
sufficiently guaranteed. We should not make use of foreign 
capital at the expense of the rights and interests of staff 
members and workers. 
  It has been learned that numerous foreign investors not only 
have paid much attention to the rich labor resources in China, 
but have also have paid greater attention to labor management in 
foreign-invested enterprises and hope that labor management can 
be put in the orbit of the legal system as quickly as possible. 
It appears that strengthening labor management according to the 
law in foreign-invested enterprises will not drive away the 
"foreign gods of wealth" (only those who are eager for quick 
success and instant benefit will be driven away), whereas 
unprincipled accommodation will inevitably harm the interests of 
the state and the rights and interests of the staff members and 
workers and will eventually affect the improvement of the 
investment environment. 
  According to comrades from the Ministry of Labor and the 
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the pressing task at 
present is to speed up labor legislation. In view of the 
characteristics of foreign-invested enterprises, it is advisable 
to formulate the "Law on the Labor Management of Enterprises 
With Investment Made by Foreign Businessmen" as quickly as 
possible. Otherwise, work in this respect will be in a dilemma 
in which there is no law to go by and no rule or regulation to 
follow. There should be a clear and unified definition for 
minimum wages, a labor contract, labor protection, social 
security, basic rights and interests of workers, and so on, and 
there should be a sound monitoring mechanism. We should 
strengthen the functions of trade unions and urge 
foreign-invested enterprises to set up trade unions so that 
trade unions can truly become bridges between the labor side and 
the capital side. Besides, we can also use as reference the 
experience of the Beijing Jeep Company Limited and institute the 
system of holding collective talks (reaching agreements) so that 
labor-capital relations can be normalized and standardized. 
  Local governments should also combine the work of attracting 
foreign capital with labor management and in examining and 
approving contracts or projects. They should include in these 
contracts or projects sections on the legitimate rights and 
interests of staff members and workers of the Chinese side. 
Since the number of foreign-invested enterprises is increasing 
in various localities and their scales are expanding, they 
should also further ensure that safety and sanitation monitoring 
work is carried out in order to avoid the recurrence of 
tragedies like the fire in Mawei. They should spread publicity 
and education on the legal system, enable foreign businessmen to 
understand the relevant Chinese policies and laws on labor, help 
staff members and workers strengthen the sense of 
self-protection, draw lessons from the crimes of the woman 
worker surnamed Dong of the Gaofu Company, and establish a sense 
of the legal system. 
  Some people predict that, with the gradual deepening of 
reform, the gap between the income of workers of state-owned 
enterprises and that of workers of foreign-invested enterprises 
will narrow day by day. This will play the role of checking and 
balancing labor management throughout society.

<F P=106> [By reporter Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755): "China's Foreign </F>
Trade Official Says Foreign Investment Structure Has Changed"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 19 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Ma 
Xiuhong, deputy director of the Foreign Investment Management 
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, met with reporters this morning in Hong Kong. He 
said: It is expected that foreign capital will continue to flow 
into China, but a structural change in foreign investment will 
occur. For example, the investment in the real estate industry 
has begun to shift to the construction of lower-cost housing 
with slight profits and the reconstruction of the old urban 
districts. Large infrastructural projects in the fields of 
energy production and transportation will also attract more 
foreign investment. 
  Ma Xiuhong said: In the course of developing the socialist 
market economy, China will gradually improve the relevant 
legislation in order to meet the needs of the market economy. 
The policy for using foreign funds will also be adjusted to a 
certain degree. However, the adjustments will make it more 
favorable to outside investors in the mainland. The current 
favorable policies for investment made by Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan compatriots on the mainland will not change. 
  Ma Xiuhong said: In recent years, foreign investment in 
China's interior areas increased faster than that in the coastal 
areas. Although the base is low, foreign investment in the 
interior has great potential. It is completely possible to 
further heighten the speed of attracting foreign investment 
there. 
  She said: Over the past two to three years, the amount of 
foreign investment attracted by China has increased rapidly. 
The number of contracts and agreements concerning foreign 
investment in China and the amounts of foreign investment 
actually made in China in 1992 all exceeded the total of the 
previous 13 years. Foreign investment again doubled in 1993 on 
the basis of that in 1992. By the end of 1993, there were more 
than 174,000 foreign-funded enterprises in mainland China, and 
their total investment reached $220 billion. The amount of 
foreign funds actually used by them reached $61.8 billion.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Si Liang (1835 5328)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 18 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the 
1990's, the government in Beijing has vigorously encouraged 
mainland enterprises to go overseas for development, build 
transnational groups, participate in international stock markets 
and purchasing activities, and strengthen their ability to 
compete. 
  Mainland enterprises' transnational business activities are 
developing step by step along the "mainland-Hong Kong-overseas" 
route. In the beginning, businesses primarily concentrated on 
commerce, trade, resources development, contracting for 
construction projects, transportation and communication, and 
international tourism. Up to the end of last year, the total 
number of overseas enterprises reached 4,500 in 120 countries 
and regions throughout the world. 
  The Hong Kong-based China-funded large enterprises -- such 
as 
the China Resources group, China Merchants Steam Navigation 
group, China Travel Service group, CITIC Pacific group, 
Everbright group, and Guangdong group -- have indeed developed 
into transnational corporations, and their business channels 
have already reached out to many destinations overseas. The 
mainland enterprises which are listed in Hong Kong, such as 
Tsingtao Brewery Company Limited, Beiren Printing Machinery 
Holdings Limited, Guangzhou Shipyard International Company 
Limited, Maanshan Iron and Steel, Shanghai Petrochemical Company 
Limited, Yizheng Chemical Fiber, and Kunming Machine Tools, as 
well as the several companies which are listed in the United 
States, have in fact taken the first step toward becoming 
transnational companies. 
  Over the past two or three years, proceeding from trading 
companies, the mainland's overseas enterprises have one after 
another organized comprehensive commercial associations, that 
is, have grouped together some overseas enterprises and a large 
number of medium and small enterprises which are not very 
strong, to form transnational groups which possess great 
strength. For example, 20 large enterprises in Beijing, which 
engage in different trades, have organized themselves into a 
joint-stock transnational group, which possesses strong points 
in the areas of trading, industry, science, agriculture, and 
commerce and is vigorously exploring the market in Latin 
America. In Shanghai, approximately 480 overseas enterprises 
have recently reorganized themselves into five major overseas 
groups of companies situated in America, Oceania, the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, and Hong Kong. Early 
this year, the West Europe Group of Companies was founded. 
  At the same time, the mainland authorities are encouraging 
large enterprises to go overseas for development. For example, 
in an international bid at the end of 1992, Shoudu Iron and 
Steel Corporation bought the Peru Iron Mine, which had been 
losing money for years; one year later, the loss-making 
situation stopped and profits began to roll in, amounting to $7 
million. One and a half years ago, the Shoudu Iron and Steel 
Corporation joined hands with Li Ka-shing to buy the Tung Wing 
group in Hong Kong; thereafter, it bought four listed companies 
in Hong Kong and set up its Hong Kong and U.S. headquarters. 
For example, the CITIC group recently bought Australia's 
largest meat processing enterprise at a price of 100 million 
Australian dollars, and the China National Petroleum Corporation 
joined hands with a Japanese company and a Chinese company in 
investing $1 billion in exploring and operating an oil zone in 
central Papua New Guinea. These are some of the success stories. 
  Recently, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation 
revealed that it will spend five years building a transnational 
oil company, which will include a number of sole companies 
limited and a number of joint-stock companies, with some 
controlling a majority of shares while others holding a minority 
of shares. At present, the company is exploring and building 11 
oil fields, which are expected to produce 12 million tons of oil 
and 4 billion cubic meters of gas annually by 1997. In the 
past, the company has absorbed $3.8 billion of foreign funds and 
has signed 94 contracts with 55 companies in the international 
community; it has already acquired the scale of a big 
international company, and will quickly develop into a 
transnational petroleum group. 
  Mainland experts point out that, with the continuous 
increase 
in China's strength and its improvement of its operational 
methods, by following the path taken by the Shoudu Iron and 
Steel Corporation and the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation, China will have a large number of companies 
developing into transnational groups.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Investment in China's 
tourism industry has a larger proportion of foreign investment 
than any other of the country's industries, according to a 
senior official of the State Tourism Administration. 
  By the end of this April, foreign investment in China's 
restaurants, tourism transport, construction of tourist spots, 
and tourist entertainment facilities totaled more than 10 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  About 53 percent of total input in China's tourism industry 
comes from foreign investors. In addition, tourist projects 
which are to be financed through foreign investment under 
government plans will further increase this ratio to 72.9 
percent of the total investment in China's tourism. 
  So far, according to the official, the State Planning 
Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
and the State Tourism Administration have jointly approved 88 
projects of construction and reconstruction of hotels with 
25,600 guest-rooms, which drew a total foreign investment of 
1.88 billion U.S. dollars. 
  With the introduction of foreign funds, the official noted, 
China has greatly improved its tourist services and further 
expanded the accommodation designed for overseas visitors. 
  At present, China has more than 3,000 hotels specially aimed 
at visitors from other countries, which receive an annual 
average of 40 million overseas tourists.

<F P=106> [Report by Chai Mao (2693 5399): "Operation Has Been Normal </F>
Over the Past Four Months Since the Introduction of the New Tax 
System"] 
  [Text] According to information received from the State 
General Administration of Taxation, the overall operation of the 
new tax system, which began to be implemented on 1 January 1994, 
has been normal; most of the problems arisen have been or are 
being solved; and a smooth transition from the old tax system to 
the new one has basically been achieved. At present, the 
development of our national economy has entered the limits of 
the expected goals of macroscopic regulation. By the end of 
April, tax payments increased 29.2 percent over the same period 
of last year, and incomes at the central and local levels grew 
at the same pace. The tax reform has not triggered off large 
fluctuations in market commodity prices. 
  As introduced by a leading cadre of the State General 
Administration of Taxation, since the new tax system has only 
operated for four months, only initial results have been 
achieved. One type of the new problems that have arisen, in a 
nutshell, is problems related to the tax policy, which are 
primarily manifested in whether the tax burden of enterprises is 
justifiable and whether tax payments received can be deducted in 
a reasonable way. The other type is related to operation. For 
example, massive operational training was organized before the 
introduction of the new tax system, but, overall, it has not 
been enough, and problems such as calculation mistakes, 
erroneous classification, and mixed-up accounting have occurred. 
  With studies and investigation conducted over the past four 
months, most of the tax burden policy problems commonly 
reflected have been solved. For example, as far as enterprises 
of civil administration and welfare, school-run enterprises, and 
enterprises running the wholesale business of "shopping basket" 
commodities are concerned, preferential policies are still being 
applied to them, and the method of collecting taxes first and 
then returning the levies to them is being implemented. The 
value-added tax rate of agricultural produce, metal mineral 
products, non-metal mineral products, and coal has been reduced 
from 17 to 13 percent. Grain and edible oil allocated and 
transferred wholesale to the people by state-owned grain and 
commercial enterprises will be exempt from value-added tax for 
two years; as will agricultural means of production, such as 
feed, seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting, 
and farm machinery. Tap water, small facilities of water and 
power supply below the county level, and some building 
materials, such as sand, soil, and stone, will be taxed at the 
rate of 6 percent. The tax on junk purchased from society is 
reduced by 10 percent, and tax on freight is reduced by 10 
percent. Moreover, it is clearly stated that preferential 
policies concerning enterprise income tax are still applicable 
to enterprises involved with new and advanced technologies, 
service enterprises, enterprises utilizing "three wastes," new 
enterprises in "old, new, border, and impoverished" areas, labor 
service and employment enterprises, school-run enterprises, 
enterprises of civil administration and welfare, and township 
and town enterprises. 
  The leading cadre of the State General Administration of 
Taxation said: The contradiction of some problems has been 
alleviated after taking a number of measures, but a process is 
still necessary before the small taxpayers' problem, the problem 
of deducting tax payments contained in the opening inventory, 
and so on are completely solved. Moreover, solutions for some 
problems have been fixed and are being implemented.

<F P=106> [Report: "Li Yonggui, Deputy Director of State </F>
Administration of Taxation, Says Land Value-Added Tax Is 
Centrally Enforced and Not To Be Changed by the Local 
Authorities"] 
  [Text] Li Yonggui, deputy director of the State 
Administration of Taxation, said yesterday in Hong Kong that, 
while land value-added tax is based on local tax structures, and 
local authorities therefore should be allowed to set a suitable 
rate for themselves as the economy develops, at the present 
stage it is enforced by the central authorities, and the local 
authorities are not allowed to raise or reduce it on their own. 
  At a seminar titled "China's Taxation, Financial Reform, and 
Hong Kong's Economy," Li Yonggui reiterated that the central 
authorities would not postpone levying the new tax, however 
strong the reactions from the outside world. The new tax is now 
being held up pending the announcement of the implementation 
procedures and will be enforced once they are in place, which he 
predicted will be before the end of this year. 
  Referring to the recent announcement of a 30 percent rise in 
state tax revenue, Li Yonggui denied that the new tax would 
increase burdens for enterprises, explaining that the higher tax 
revenue came mainly from the abolition of past preferential 
policies or tax reductions or moratoriums.

<F P=106> [By Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 24 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According 
to a report published a few days ago, the land value-added tax 
will not be collected this year and several senior taxation 
officials at the provincial level also think that detailed rules 
for collecting land value-added tax will not be promulgated this 
year. A ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE reporter interviewed Dong Shukui 
on this. Dong Shukui is deputy director of the Foreign-Related 
Taxation Department of the State Administration of Taxation and 
is visiting Hong Kong. Dong Shukui said: At present, detailed 
rules for collecting land value-added tax are being formulated 
in earnest and they will certainly be published this year. 
  Dong Shukui pointed out: Detailed rules for collecting the 
land value-added tax will soon be promulgated. They may be 
promulgated in the first half of this year and their 
promulgation will probably not be delayed until the end of the 
year. The detailed rules will certainly give full consideration 
to the issues which real estate investors are concerned about. 
  It is known that collection of land value-added tax will 
only 
begin after the promulgation of detailed rules for collecting 
land value-added tax. 
  Vice Construction Minister Li Zhendong disclosed not long 
ago 
that detailed rules for collecting land value-added tax 
tentatively state that no land value-added tax should be levied 
on real estate projects whose contracts were officially signed 
before 1 January 1994, and all real estate projects whose 
profits do not exceed 20 percent of the cost should also be 
exempted from land value-added tax. Land value-added tax should 
be levied on real estate development projects investing in 
ordinary residential housing and other low-profit housing only 
if profits exceed 40 percent of costs. 
  Li Zhendong also said that detailed rules for collecting 
land 
value-added tax would be promulgated in the near future.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- With the State 
Council's approval, the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
[CAAC] and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC] recently jointly issued the "Circular on 
the Policy on Foreign Investment in the Civil Aviation 
Industry." The circular said: To accelerate the development of 
the civil aviation industry and to improve the operations and 
management of the industry, with the State Council's approval, 
foreign companies are conditionally allowed to invest in China's 
civil aviation industrial projects with the state as the major 
investor. 
  The circular said: Foreign companies are allowed to invest 
in the construction of the flight zones (including runways, 
taxiways, and parking aprons) of civil airports (not including 
airports for military and civil purposes; same in the following) 
in the PRC in the form of joint ventures or contractual joint 
ventures. Investment of the Chinese side should be more than 51 
percent of a company's registered capital, and the company's 
chairman of the board and president are to be Chinese. Priority 
will be given to considering investment by foreign companies 
investing in constructing flight zones of civil airports in the 
construction of airport terminal buildings (excluding 
construction and management of VIP rooms) cargo warehouses, 
ground service centers, aircraft maintenance centers, in-flight 
food service centers, guesthouses, restaurants, air fuel supply 
facilities, and other airport-support projects. Chinese 
investment in the construction of airport terminal buildings 
should be more than 51 percent, and chairmen of the boards and 
presidents should be Chinese. With approval, foreign companies 
investing in the construction of civil airport flight zones may 
appropriately expand their business areas to include the 
management of airport terminal buildings, cargo warehouses, 
ground service centers, aircraft maintenance centers, in-flight 
food service centers, guesthouses, restaurants, air fuel supply 
facilities, and other airport-support projects. Air traffic 
control systems are to be invested in and managed by the state; 
foreign companies are not to invest in these projects or take 
part in their management. 
  The circular pointed out: Foreign companies, particularly 
foreign air transportation companies, are allowed to jointly 
invest in Chinese air transportation companies in establishing 
air transportation enterprises in the form of joint ventures or 
contractual joint ventures. Foreign companies, particularly 
foreign air transportation companies, are allowed to purchase 
shares of Chinese air transportation companies, or to exchange 
shares with them to establish air transportation enterprises. 
At the beginning, one or two foreign air transportation 
companies will be selected by the CAAC and other concerned 
departments to invest in establishing air transportation 
enterprises in China on a trial basis. More foreign companies 
will be allowed to do so if the trial operations are successful. 
Foreign companies' shares must not be more than 35 percent of 
co-invested air transportation enterprises' registered or 
paid-up capital, and their voting rights at the co-invested 
companies' boards of directors must not be more than 25 percent. 
Chairmen of the boards and the presidents of co-invested 
companies are to be Chinese. Air transportation enterprises 
with foreign investment enjoy the same taxation treatment as 
similar Chinese enterprises. Foreign airport authorities and 
aircraft manufacturing enterprises are not allowed to invest in 
establishing air transportation enterprises in China. 
  The circular said: Foreign companies are allowed to invest 
in aviation enterprises in the form of joint ventures or 
contractual joint ventures for agricultural and forestry 
purposes. The percentage of foreign investment shall be decided 
by the Chinese and foreign investors. Approval should be gained 
from the CAAC for the establishment of civil aviation 
enterprises with foreign investment. For projects of which the 
authority of approval is beyond that of the CAAC, the State 
Planning Commission is to examine the reports on the projects 
and the feasibility reports, and the MOFTEC is to examine 
relevant contracts and regulations. For projects of which the 
authority of approval lies with the CAAC, the CAAC is to examine 
the reports on the projects and the feasibility reports. 
Contracts and regulations related to the projects are to be 
submitted to the MOFTEC for approval.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Council's 
General Office recently issued a circular on improving the 
protection and management of forest resources. The circular 
said: In recent years, various localities have made new headway 
in accelerating the pace of afforestation and greening, and in 
improving the protection of forest resources. Some new problems 
have arisen in our forestry sector, however. Chief among them 
are an increase in the excessive consumption of forest 
resources, the rather serious problem of logging in excess of 
authorized quotas, and the renewed practices of indiscriminately 
felling and logging trees and of recklessly capturing and 
hunting wildlife. People's governments at all levels and all 
relevant departments should take these problems seriously, and 
they should earnestly study ways to solve them. 
  In the circular, the State Council's General Office said 
emphatically: Although our country has achieved growth in both 
forested areas and forest reserves, it is still deficient in 
forests, with dwindling full-grown or overgrown forest 
resources. People's governments at all levels should take 
forestry-related work seriously. We should make use of all 
economic and legal means, adopt administrative measures which 
are conducive to the protection and development of forest 
resources, and devote earnest efforts to protecting and managing 
forest resources. 
  First, we should strictly implement the system of logging 
quotas and timber transportation based on relevant documents. 
Annual logging quotas, which are approved by the State Council 
for prescribed periods, represent the maximum consumption 
amounts for various localities when they exploit forest 
resources; they are legally binding. No localities may surpass 
the quotas without the approval of the State Council or other 
authorized units. In the second half of 1994, all localities 
should extensively review the progress of recent years in 
enforcing logging quotas, and strictly deal with units that 
exceed logging quotas. We should continue the policy of 
allowing forestry departments to exercise unified management and 
organize trips into the mountains to buy timber from key 
timber-producing counties, and may not willfully abolish timber 
inspection stations established in accordance with the law. 
Railways and transportation departments should maintain the 
system of transporting timber based on relevant documents. 
Administrative organs and law enforcement departments are 
strictly forbidden to run logging operations under various 
pretexts and in various forms. 
  Second, we should tighten supervision and management over 
woodland utilization and implement the system of compensated 
woodland utilization. Units and individuals which have not 
attended to relevant procedures in accordance with the law may 
not, under any pretext, occupy or allot for free utilization 
woodland which is used by state-owned forestry enterprises and 
institutions. Forestry rights certificates are legal documents 
attesting to ownership rights to forests, timber, and woodland. 
People's governments at all levels should review illegal 
woodland appropriation and occupation since the second half of 
1992; set deadlines for attending to procedures for examination, 
approval, and compensation; and retake illegally appropriated 
and occupied woodland upon failure to complete such procedures. 
  Third, we should conscientiously improve the protection and 
management of wildlife and rare plants. People's governments at 
all levels should take wildlife and rare plant protection as 
their important duty, institute an on-the-job responsibility 
system, and implement various protection measures. 
  Fourth, we should improve forestry administration and basic 
services regarding forest resources, and stabilize the 
forestry-related law-enforcement ranks. People's governments at 
all levels, particularly county-level forestry departments, 
should place a premium on basic services such as forest resource 
protection and management. They should stabilize the ranks of 
managerial and law-enforcement personnel for forestry 
administration, forestry-related public security, timber 
inspection stations, and forestry work stations. They should 
actively solve practical staffing and funding problems, and 
foster good working conditions for such personnel. 
  Fifth, we should sternly combat all kinds of illegal and 
criminal activities which destroy forest resources. People's 
governments at all levels should take resolute measures against, 
and devote special efforts to cracking down expeditiously on, 
illegal and criminal acts committed by various people's 
governments to pilfer and clandestinely log trees owned by the 
state and collectives; to occupy woodland illegally; to hunt, 
smuggle, and trade illegally in wildlife and allied products 
which are on the state's priority protection list; to damage 
rare plants; and to beat up and injure forestry-related 
law-enforcement personnel. 
  Sixth, we should uphold the responsibility system based on 
tenure-specific objectives under which leading cadres protect 
and develop forest resources. Forest resource protection and 
management are an important duty of people's governments at all 
levels. We should take the growth and depletion of forest 
resources as one of the criteria against which to evaluate the 
performance of leaders at all levels, especially those at the 
county and township levels. We must investigate the 
responsibility of key administrative leaders if they have caused 
heavy losses through their failure to effectively halt the 
practices of indiscriminately felling and logging trees, 
illegally occupying woodland, and recklessly capturing and 
hunting wildlife while they are in office. We should commend 
and reward those who have achieved remarkable results in 
protecting, nurturing, and developing forest resources.

  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- China has vowed to 
strengthen the protection and control of the country's forest 
resources, according to a circular issued by the State Council 
recently. 
  According to the circular, the country's timber consumption 
climbed, and the cut in some localities was on the rise. 
  In response, the circular urged governments at all levels 
and 
relevant departments to pay special attention to the protection 
and management of forest resources, saying that the limit on 
timber cuts and transport licensing system should be enforced 
strictly. 
  Also, and the management of forest area use and the 
protection of wildlife and rare plants should be considered an 
important duty of local authorities, said the circular, noting 
that those caught destroying the forest will be punished 
severely.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lin Hongmei (2651 4767 2734)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 29 May (XINHUA) -- Since its implementation 
seven years ago, the nationwide bumper harvest projects for 
agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry have 
succeeded in introducing a great number of scientific and 
technological achievements and advanced, workable skills to 
agricultural production, bringing about not only a more 
bountiful farm products market but also substantial incomes 
among the vast number of peasants. 
  According to information provided by the Agriculture 
Ministry's Bumper Harvest Projects Office, currently grain, 
cotton, and oil-bearing crops cultivated with the new skills 
promoted under the bumper harvest projects have reached 1 
billion mu in total acreage. Grain production for the past seven 
years has increased by 23.8 billion kg, ginned cotton by 556 
million kg, oil-bearing crops by 2.3 billion kg, sugar crops by 
7.5 billion kg, vegetables and fruits by 1.8 billion kg; meats, 
poultry, and eggs by 620 million kg; aquatic products by 400 
million kg, and milk by 28 million kg, with the increase in the 
output value of these products totalling 26.8 billion yuan. 
  The nationwide bumper harvest projects for agriculture, 
animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry -- which were jointly 
initiated and promoted by the Agriculture and Finance Ministries 
in 1987 with all-out participation by 30 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout the country -- 
have thus far promoted 147 new technological items, including 
new, good crop varieties; new, good poultry and livestock 
breeds; dry-land farming; simulated agricultural cultivation; 
water-conserving cultivation; cultivation using plastic 
sheeting; horticulture; improvements in fertilizer formulas; 
comprehensive crop disease, pest, weed, and rat control; straw 
ammoniation; feed and additive formula improvements; high-yield 
aquatic breeding; fresh-keeping, storage, transportation, and 
processing of farm products; agricultural mechanization in 
cultivation and breeding; and rural energy development. Backed 
by special funds and pushed hard by government actions, these 
new technologies have been promoted rapidly at the agricultural 
production level and have had huge benefits. The 20 projects 
implemented last year under the nationwide bumper harvest 
projects for agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and 
forestry have resulted in an increase of 1.98 billion kg in 
grain production, 47.6 million kg in ginned cotton, and 179 
million kg in oil-bearing crops -- respectively 23 percent, 3.3 
percent, and 20 percent more than the planned targets -- and an 
increase of 3.74 billion yuan in output value. Practice has 
shown that bumper harvest projects have turned out to be an 
important means in speeding up the transformation of China's 
agricultural scientific and technological achievements, in 
guaranteeing its agricultural production, and in promoting the 
development of rural productivity. 
  The bumper harvest projects have been a major state plan in 
enhancing the level of rural productivity. For the past seven 
years, a total of 16.5 billion yuan have been invested in the 
project, of which 180 million yuan were state revenues, while 
the remainder were made up of local funds and loans. The state 
has specifically formulated a guiding group for the projects. 
In attaching importance to their implementation, governments at 
provincial, prefectural, and county levels have adopted a 
contract management system to ensure success. Last year, 197 
first-tier contracts were signed between the Agriculture 
Ministry and various provinces, regions, cities, and cities with 
provincial-level economic powers, while 950 second-tier 
agreements were entered into between provinces and counties, 
with personnel being designated at each and every level to 
guarantee the successful promotion of all new skills at the 
peasants' level. 
  Through explorations and summing up amid practice, the 
bumper 
harvest projects have developed an effective, regulated, and 
institutionalized management pattern of their own. From the 
very outset, the nationwide bumper harvest projects have adopted 
a competitive mechanism by singling out for promotion scientific 
and technological achievements which have a bearing on the 
national economy and the people's livelihood and which are 
capable of enhancing the economic results of China's 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries industries, as well 
as of stimulating the development of the three aforementioned 
industries. In the course of their implementation, project 
contracting units must present periodical progress reports to 
parties offering such contracts. Before a project is concluded, 
all interested parties will undertake the appraisal and summing 
up process according to project and contract requirements. 
Circulating funds handed down together with appropriations are 
to be utilized on a rolling basis, under which repayments must 
be made in time. Defaults in repayment may result in the 
suspension of appropriations for the next project. These rigid 
management rules have provided a new say to better manage 
China's agricultural funds under market economic conditions.

1837): "Guangzhou Adopts Strong Measures To Ban Illegal Land 
Use and Construction"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 31 May (TA KUNG PAO) -- At a special 
meeting today, Guangzhou Construction Committee Director Ou 
Guangquan said: In view of illegal land use and illegal 
construction in Guangzhou, which continue to spread despite 
consistent efforts to ban them, Guangzhou will adopt strong 
measures to exert pressure on the enterprises in relevant 
quarters. 
  The measures provide that all documents on land and 
construction projects approved ultra vires or through the abuse 
of power are invalid, that all approved documents and blueprints 
for such projects which have yet to begin must be withdrawn for 
cancellation, that all such projects under development must be 
immediately stopped and given the maximum fine by the relevant 
departments in accordance with laws and regulations, and that 
all units which have undertaken to design or develop such 
illegal projects will be ordered to stop designing and 
development and will have their professional grade lowered or 
their professional licenses canceled. 
  If a unit stubbornly develops an illegal project to make it 
an accomplished fact, the authorities in charge of the land will 
not recognize its property rights and must not allow it to be 
bought or sold, inherited, given as a present, rented out, 
transferred, or mortgaged; the notary office will not notarize 
it; the water supply company will not supply water to it; the 
electricity supply company will not supply electricity to it; 
the police station will not allow it to be occupied; post and 
telecommunications departments will not offer postal services or 
telecommunications service to it; the industrial and commercial 
department will not issue a business license to it; and the fire 
service, environmental protection, and public health and 
quarantine departments will not grant it professional 
recognition. 
  Relevant persons said: According to earlier surveys, it was 
discovered that in the districts of Baiyun, Huangpu, and Fangcun 
in the suburbs of Guangzhou, foreign businessmen have been 
deceived. They had invested hastily in projects and built 
standard plants or apartments without obtaining valid documents. 
Their projects were eventually found to be illegal through 
inspection, and they were fined and ordered to cancel 
development and planning for their projects. 
  Moreover, relevant persons reminded people that they should 
be cautious about exaggerated advertisements in newspapers and 
on the radio and said that if the property had no legal 
documentation or documents were lacking, consumers would always 
fall victim.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 20 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
"Knowledge assets" and "goodwill assets" are what have helped 
Guangdong people repeatedly prevail in business battles. 
Quietly, an enthusiasm for "intangible assets appraisal" is 
growing across Guangdong. The strange power of this "magic 
weapon" employed by Guangdong people is being popularized and 
standardized. 
  One year ago, China's first "intangible assets appraisal 
office" was established in Shenzhen, opening a new chapter in 
the history of scientific appraisal and fair pricing of patented 
technologies, copyrights, business franchises, service 
trademarks, and approval rights owned by Chinese firms and 
intellectuals. The Shenzhen City Intangible Assets Appraisal 
Office has made over 30 appraisal reports commissioned by more 
than 20 clients. 
  Sources revealed that the office assessed the trademarks and 
goodwill of the "Sanjiu" Corporation to be worth roughly 700 
million yuan, and the formula for Yunnan Baiyao [a medicine] at 
over 40 million yuan. When a university bought into a 
joint-stock enterprise with one of its scientific and 
technological achievements, the office gave it a monetary value 
of 32 million yuan. An engineer was awarded 460,000 yuan worth 
of technology-generated earnings over a three-year period by a 
company after it adopted his patented technology. Courts have 
ruled that "intangible assets appraisals" are admissible as 
evidence. 
  Guangdong Province has been cautious about the appearance of 
offices for appraising intangible assets, and apart from 
Shenzhen, only Zhuhai has formed an intangible assets appraising 
group -- a provincial assets appraisal center is still being 
prepared. However, intellectual and business circles are very 
enthusiastic about this "intangible" industry. People hope very 
much for a quantified "statement" on the value of their 
knowledge and business goodwill.

  [Text] Guiyang, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Guizhou Province plans to build more power plants and stations 
in the coming few years. 
  As a mountainous province, Guizhou is rich in hydropower and 
coal resources. It now has a generating capacity of more than 
2.8 million kw. 
  Xiang Dehong, director of the electricity bureau of the 
province, said that more than ten power projects with a total 
generating capacity of 5.63 million kw will be constructed from 
1995 to the end of this century. 
  As its neighboring east Chinese provinces suffer power 
shortages, the province aims to jointly build power stations and 
plants with these provinces and supply more electrical power to 
them. 
  At present, several such projects are under construction and 
two power transmission lines to Guangdong Province have been 
completed and another one is being built. A transmission line 
to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is also under 
construction. 
  As the power industry develops, the electricity-consuming 
mining and metallurgy industries are becoming the mainstays of 
the province's economy.

  [Text] A high-powered corruption case at the heart of 
China's intensifying clash of central and regional interests is 
about to explode into public view. 
  The case involves connections stretching to a senior party 
and military leader, Yang Shangkun, and could result in 
disciplinary action against the mayor of Chengdu, Wang Rongxuan. 
  Documents obtained by Eastern Express show that the 
country's 
top anti-corruption bureau -- the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
-- ordered a special investigation this month into massive 
embezzlement of funds invested by overseas Chinese in Sichuan 
province since 1988. 
  The case pits a famous Kuomintang warlord family with links 
to the Yang family in Beijing against powerful elements of the 
Sichuan provincial bureaucracy. 
  The Sichuan bureaucrats have resisted instructions from 
Beijing to investigate other officials accused of making off 
with millions of renminbi in funds. 
  A series of "internal reference" reports concerning the case 
have circulated among top Beijing leaders, but have not 
previously been made public because of fears that this would 
reduce the flow of funds from overseas Chinese (including those 
in Hong Kong and Taiwan), which account for more than 80 percent 
of foreign investment in China. 
  Allegations centre on Wen Jinjing, the chairman of the 
Chengdu Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. 
  In April 1990, Wen appointed himself president of the 
Chengdu 
Overseas Chinese Property Development Company, a joint venture 
between the federation and a group of overseas Chinese in the 
city led by Su Tianshu. 
  The 58-year-old Su was instrumental in attracting funds to 
the company before he was forced to retire because of the vast 
Taiwan and overseas Chinese connections of his former wife, Wang 
Jihua. 
  Wang, who emigrated to Hong Kong in 1988, is the 
granddaughter of a Kuomintang general who served in Chengdu 
during the Chinese civil war. 
  Since the sacking of Su, shareholders have accused Wen of 
making off with millions in funds from the company and its 
investment fund, most of which they claim has found its way into 
the pockets of city officials. 
  Su fled from Chengdu to Beijing in December 1990, fearing 
detention after he accused city officials of corruption and 
misbehaviour in the federation's virtual confiscation of the 
company. 
  He received protection in Beijing because his current wife, 
Yang Shaojing, is the niece of the senior party and military 
leader Yang Shangkun, who was China's president at the time. 
  When Su first fled to Beijing in 1990, Yang family 
connections arranged the first of several "internal reference" 
articles on the case. Such articles are written by senior staff 
of party-controlled media organs on sensitive issues for 
restricted access by top leaders. 
  An internal reference article on the case -- written by the 
Industrial and Commercial Daily editor, Chen Hongyu, in late 
1990 -- said Wang Rongxuan, the then deputy party secretary of 
the city, had failed to issue any written orders to discipline 
those involved in the takeover of the company. 
  While Wang held a special party meeting on the case, no 
notes 
were taken and no written instructions issued, the article said. 
  The article was circulated to top party and government 
officials of Sichuan province, but Su claims no action was taken. 
  Wen first got into trouble with the law in December 1991 
when 
the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court ruled against him in a 
dispute with the Sichuan Light Industrial Products Sales Centre. 
  Wen had used the name of the property development company's 
investment fund to take on a consignment of Rmb1.1m [renminbi] 
(HK$900,770 [Hong Kong dollars]) worth of goods from the light 
industry company, hoping to resell it later at a big profit. 
  After Wen reneged on the debt, the investment fund was 
forced 
to pay the money, even though investors claimed he had no 
authorisation to conduct such business. 
  Wen had mainly taken refrigerators, alcohol, gold and 
televisions -- although it is not clear where the goods went. 
  By the time Su appealed to the provincial government in 
1992, 
Wen had paid only Rmb700,000 for the goods he took. 
  Su argued that evidence uncovered in the court case about 
Wen's wrongdoing should have been sent on to the 
procuratorate-general or public security authorities for 
criminal investigation. The court had said there was not enough 
evidence to support such charges. 
  The Sichuan procuratorate later admitted that Wen's 
"mismanagement" was to blame for the Rmb400,000 that was never 
paid, but stopped short of taking disciplinary action. 
  Allegations of embezzlement also surrounded Wen's dealings 
with the head of the investment fund, Hu Zuokui. 
  Six overseas Chinese investors in the company accused Wen 
and 
Hu of illegally borrowing a total of Rmb4.57m from the 
investment fund none of which had been returned -- in a December 
1991 letter written to the then Chengdu deputy party secretary, 
Wang Rongxuan (now mayor), and former party secretary, Wu Xihai 
(now a member of China's political consultative body). 
  The letter said Wen took Rmb390,000 for himself and used 
another Rmb800,000 as bail after Hu was detained on charges of 
fraud in a case in Zhuhai. 
  The rest of the funds were unaccounted for. 
  Savings in an investment fund under the company had reached 
Rmb36m when the letter was written. 
  In a letter to the Sichuan procuratorate general in March 
1992, Su charged that Wang Rongxuan and the party secretary of 
the federation, Zhao Bingyue, had protected Wen from being 
disciplined after the body set up a joint provincial city team 
to reinvestigate the case. 
  Su also said Wen should have been tried on criminal charges 
for unlawfully firing him, confiscating his personal investment 
of Rmb320,000 in the company and ransacking the office. 
  Company annual reports show that because of the ransacking 
of 
the office, staff were forced to set up temporary offices at 
work sites in order to continue work on low-cost housing 
projects in Chengdu. 
  Between 1992 and this year, Su has made several more trips 
to 
Beijing and pressure has mounted on the Sichuan government to 
reopen the case and impose disciplinary measures. 
  In March the first signs of a change of heart among Sichuan 
officials appeared. 
  The Sichuan procuratorate called on Chengdu officials to 
restore Su to president of the company or alternatively "make 
proper arrangements" for him, usually taken to mean monetary 
compensation. It added that it was "considering" disciplinary 
action against Wen. But Su is uninterested in monetary 
compensation and insists the investigation must go to higher 
levels. 
  "Although the [Sichuan] government made certain statements, 
there has been no result," Su told the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate in Beijing in a letter last month. 
  In a veiled reference to charges presented to Beijing that 
senior officials in Chengdu received some of the funds allegedly 
embezzled by Wen, Su called for "all those responsible" to be 
disciplined. 
  Now Beijing has decided to step into the case. 
  Su returned from Beijing last week, where Yu Xueru, the head 
of the Number Nine Office of the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
-- handling Sichuan affairs -- promised to force his provincial 
counterpart to reopen the case. 
  Speaking to Eastern Express from Chengdu, Su indicated his 
demands that higher levels be investigated will be met. 
  "Mr Yu has promised complete satisfaction," he said. 
  The Chengdu party secretary, Huang Ymkui, has been ordered 
to 
provide a written report to Yu on the case by the end of this 
month, Su said. 
  Su admitted it was the Yang family that made it possible to 
bring the case to the attention of the central government. 
"Yang [Shangkun] does not allow family members to get involved 
personally in cases. But they helped get my materials to the 
right people," he said. 
  Su has stepped forward to reveal details of the case 
because, 
as he said, "supervision of officials by public opinion is not 
adequate in China". 
  "After four years of frustration, I feel only by using the 
free press of Hong Kong can anything be accomplished," he said.

<F P=106> [Report given by Acting Governor Tian Fengshan at the </F>
provincial people's congress standing committee meeting on 20 
May] 
  [Text] Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Secretaries General, and 
all Committee Members: 
  This chairmanship meeting of the provincial people's 
congress 
has nominated me as a candidate for vice governor and acting 
governor. I feel very uneasy. The party and the people have 
entrusted me with a very heavy task. They have not only shown 
great confidence in me but also entrusted me with heavy 
responsibility and set higher demands on me. I deeply feel the 
heavy responsibility and big pressure on me. In my case, 
although I have been trained and educated by the party for many 
years and successively assumed leadership work in townships, 
counties, prefectures, cities, and the province with the help 
and support of the veteran comrades, and have gained 
understandings in the work of the grass roots and some aspects, 
however, measuring the requirements of this post, my practical 
experience, organizational ability, and leadership level still 
fall short of the requirements. I am afraid that I may create 
great losses to the party's cause and disappoint the 
expectations of the party and the people. If my nomination to 
the posts is approved, all I can do is to pluck up my courage, 
undertake the heavy tasks, and try my utmost to do the work well. 
  Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and 
through the efforts of the past leading bodies and the masses of 
cadres, our province has achieved fairly big progress in reform, 
opening up, economic construction, and social undertakings, 
laying a foundation for future work. In spite of the fact that 
Heilongjiang is now facing some practical problems and 
difficulties in economic development, however, it has its own 
distinctive advantages and tremendous potentials. If I am 
approved to be the acting governor by this people's congress 
standing committee meeting, I have the determination to work 
together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, and cadres at all levels across the province to 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee, the supervision of the people's congress and its 
standing committee, act in line with the 20-character policy of 
the Party Central committee and the overall objective on reform, 
development and stability defined by the second plenary session 
of the seventh provincial party committee and the second session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress early this year, 
carry out all sorts of major measures in a down-to-earth manner, 
and comprehensively fulfill this year's various work tasks. At 
present, we should look squarely at the problems and 
difficulties in front of us and recognize the good opportunity 
we may meet. Thanks to the endeavors of the party committee, 
the provincial government and all sectors, Heilongjiang's 
problems and difficulties have been comprehended and taken 
seriously by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. 
Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji has led responsible comrades of the relevant departments 
of the State Council to our province to conduct investigation 
and study and help us solve problems. This is a major 
opportunity for our province's reform, opening up, and economic 
development. We should treasure this opportunity, firmly grasp 
it, expand the dynamic of our work, and push our future work to 
a new height. The key to solving our province's problems on the 
way of advance is to push economic development forward. 
Therefore, as far as we are concerned, under the situation in 
which the state has helped us solve some problems, it is very 
important for us to change concepts, keep our eyes inward and 
rely on our own efforts to become strong. It is necessary to 
give full play to our province's natural resources, trained 
personnel, and industrial advantages, base on ourselves and rely 
on our own efforts to overcome difficulties, and through solid 
and effective work, translate the factors that currently 
restrict the province's development into advantages for 
invigorating Heilongjiang. In line with the ideas of "five 
extensions and two accelerations," we should grasp well the 
development and construction of major projects, cultivate and 
develop new economic growing points, and strengthen the staying 
force for the national economy. Through reform, transformation, 
opening up, and development, we should promote state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises to change mechanisms and enhance 
their vitality and strength. We should consolidate agriculture, 
the foundation of the national economy, and vigorously increase 
the comprehensive economic results of agriculture. While making 
contributions to the state, we should further achieve 
development; earnestly enforce the strategy of having science 
and education make the province prosperous; promote the 
scientific and technological progress; do a good job in the work 
of personnel affairs; and upgrade the economic quality of the 
province as a whole. Only by firmly fostering the unswerving 
and persistent belief and determination of waging arduous 
struggle can we fully discern that the current difficulties are 
just the temporary ones cropping up along the advancing road and 
are possible to overcome. Thus, the province's prosperity and 
development will certainly be very hopeful as long as we 
heighten our spirit, make concerted efforts, unite as one, go 
all out to make the province strong, refrain from engaging in 
myopic behavior for a single day, and engage in our work in a 
down-to-earth manner for several years by displaying the 
indomitable spirit and will. In order to fulfill these duties 
and to do a good job in the government work, the acting governor 
expressed in his report that he is ready to make efforts in the 
following five aspects after the repeated meditation: 
  First, the government work should be strictly placed under 
the leadership of the provincial party committee and under the 
supervision of the provincial people's congress and its standing 
committee. The linking of work and contacts with the provincial 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
committee and various democratic parties should be positively 
enhanced. 
  The provincial people's government should closely rely on 
the 
leadership of the provincial party committee. The leading body 
of the provincial people's government should set an example in 
earnestly implementing the arrangements made by the CPC Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party 
committee, and vigorously enable the work of the government and 
various departments to embody the demands set in the party's 
basic line. As for important and major policy decisions and 
measures that have a bearing on reform, opening up, economic 
development, and social stability, it is necessary to report 
them to the provincial party committee in a timely manner and to 
ask for instruction. The provincial people's government should 
unswervingly implement the guidelines, policies, and work 
arrangements defined by the provincial party committee. By 
effectively conducting our work, we should ensure the 
down-to-earth implementation of these guidelines, policies, and 
arrangements and score results in the implementation. All 
personnel from acting governor himself to the leading cadres and 
staff members of units under the provincial people's government 
should strengthen their sense of responsibility to the party and 
their sense of organization and discipline and act in unison 
with the CPC Central Committee in ideology and action. 
  In line with the provisions set in the Constitution and the 
local organizational law, we should actively report our work to 
the people's congress and its standing committee and fully 
respect the power and duties imposed by the law on the people's 
congress and its standing committee. We should also earnestly 
implement the decisions, resolutions, and local regulations and 
rules adopted by the people's congress and consciously accept 
the congress' supervision. These decisions, resolutions, and 
local regulations and rules are legally authentic and are 
important basis for standardizing the government conduct. The 
provincial people's government and its subordinate departments 
should earnestly implement these decisions, resolutions, and 
local regulations and rules and actively put forward legal 
motions in the course of establishing the law systems of 
socialist market economy so as to gradually orient the 
government work onto the track of legal systems. Efforts should 
be made to enhance the sense of democracy and legal systems; to 
do things strictly according to the law; to perform the 
administrative duties in line with the law; and to persistently 
take the lead in studying, enforcing, and abiding by the law. 
We should consciously accept the inspection conducted by the 
deputies of the people's congress over the government work. As 
for the criticism, opinions, and suggestions raised by the 
deputies of the people's congress and by the special committees 
under the people's congress, we should earnestly discuss and 
handle them and embody them into our practical work so as to use 
them to promote and improve the government work. 
  Governments should even more actively enhance their linking 
work with the provincial CPPCC committee and various democratic 
parties and fully attach importance on the role played by them 
in participating in and discussing government and political 
affairs and in conducting political consultation and democratic 
supervision. We should report in a timely manner the situation 
prevailing in the important and major issues to them and 
earnestly listen to their opinions and suggestions relating to 
the government work, economic construction, and social 
undertakings. 
  Second, we should make concerted efforts, advance in a 
united way, and bring into full play the overall functions of 
the ordinary personnel of the provincial government. 
  We should further unify our thinking to lay a good 
ideological foundation for bringing into play the overall 
functions of the ordinary personnel of the provincial 
government. We should conscientiously study the basic line of 
the party and a series of principles and policies, 
conscientiously implement the important arrangements made by the 
party Central Committee and the State Council and the guidelines 
of the important instructions on the work of Heilongjiang made 
by the leading comrades of the central authorities, and reach 
common understanding on a series of major issues. My own 
ability and energy are limited. We should rely on the wisdom 
and forces of the collectives, conscientiously listen to the 
people's opinions when making policy decisions on major issues, 
carry forward democracy, pool the wisdom and efforts of the 
people, mobilize the enthusiasm of ordinary personnel, bring 
into full play the advantages of the whole, and strive to make 
policy decisions more democratic and scientific. According to 
the principles of democratic centralism and of linking 
responsibilities with rights, each and every government leading 
member and each and every functional department should bring its 
functions into play in dealing with the routine work of the 
government; and assume responsibility for its work, its own 
rights, and fulfill its duty according to the principle of 
division of work. It is necessary to strictly perfect a system 
of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned work, intensify a 
mechanism for grasping the fulfillment of work, and bring into 
play the main functions of leading bodies and all departments 
under the governments. It is necessary to further perfect and 
intensify the system of chiefs assuming responsibility for major 
work and the leadership responsibility system among each level. 
We should adopt effective measures to ensure that the 
government work is under normal and orderly operation so as to 
make the ordinary personnel of the governments work with one 
heart and soul and do solid work and to promote the progress of 
the economic and social undertakings. 
  Third, we should persist in the mass viewpoint and rely on 
and serve the people wholeheartedly. 
  The mass viewpoint is not only a requirement for the work 
line of the party but also a decision made according to the 
purpose of the party. So, we should firmly foster the mass 
viewpoint and regard wholeheartedly relying on and serving the 
people as a point to start with and conclude the government 
work. We should strive to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for 
reform and development and fully believe and rely on the masses 
to rise over various difficulties cropping up in the course of 
advance. The government should regularly accept the supervision 
by the broad masses of the people so as to make the government 
work more visible to the public and to enjoy the understanding 
and support of the masses. The major policy decisions on reform 
and development should be passed to the masses for discussions. 
We should fully listen to the voices of the masses, respect the 
experiences gained by the masses through practice and their 
pioneering spirit, and embody their aspirations. We should go 
all out to do solid work for the masses and always be concerned 
with the weal and woe of the people. At present, we should pay 
particular attention to the issues relating to price hikes, help 
the enterprises in danger and those with difficulties solve 
their problems, and solve the production and living problems of 
the poverty-stricken rural areas. We should positively and 
conscientiously handle the affairs that are in keeping with the 
interests of the people and resolutely refuse to do the things 
that go against the personal interests of the people so as to 
make the government work and all policy decisions reflect and 
fall in with the will of the people. 
  Fourth, we should study hard to ceaselessly upgrade the 
leadership level and the ability in controlling the overall 
situation. 
  I profoundly know that Job himself does not entrust 
abilities 
of man. Even now as I take on the post of acting governor, 
this does not mean my work abilities suit the work 
requirements. There must be a process of improvement. An 
important task ahead of me at present is to study again. I have 
to learn from books and mainly study the basic principles of 
Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and the theory on socialist market 
economy. Simultaneously, I should also learn modern scientific 
and technological knowledge and modern economic, social, and 
administrative management methods; ceaselessly widen my own 
knowledge fields and upgrade my leadership abilities. We should 
learn from practice, regularly go down to the grass-roots units, 
pay attention to investigation and study, discover the new 
situation and study new problems in a timely manner, and sum up 
the experiences created by the grass-roots units and the broad 
masses of people so as to enrich ourselves and to guide our 
work. It is necessary to learn from veteran leaders and 
comrades. These veteran comrades have engaged in leadership 
work for many years and accumulated many practical experiences. 
They gave us lots of help in the past. I am willing to and 
earnestly hope that these veteran leaders and comrades will 
continue to offer views and suggestions for me and for the 
government work and enable us to avoid detours and mistakes. 
  Fifth, we should perform the government work honestly and 
diligently, do practical work, and enhance the cohesion of the 
government. 
  "One who is just will do things uprightly and one who is 
clean and honest will enjoy high prestige." I deeply feel that 
only a clean and honest government can enjoy prestige and have 
cohesion. I will start with this way of doing things myself, 
set strict norms to keep my own conduct within proper bounds in 
line with the central demands, and never abuse my own power to 
seek personal gain or do things to harm the image of the party. 
Meanwhile, I will pay attention to educating my family members, 
children, and the functionaries around me. And on this basis, I 
will work together with all of you to grasp administrative 
honesty and diligence in the government and its subordinate 
units. I will uphold the principle of taking a two-handed 
approach in work and be tough with both, and while concentrating 
efforts on grasping material civilization, exert efforts to 
grasp the spiritual civilization. In economic activities and our 
routine work, I will always attach importance to the people's 
ideological and political work and actively promote the spirit 
of building our country by means of thrift and hard work, giving 
consideration to the overall situation, maintaining unity and 
cooperation, performing official work diligently, cherishing the 
people, and being eager to make dedications among the broad 
masses of cadres and the people. I will resolutely struggle 
against all sorts of corrupt phenomena, never avoid 
contradictions, never tolerate or yield to the evil, and 
realistically check the unhealthy trends existing in major 
trades and important departments that seriously affect the 
relationship between the government and the masses. Meanwhile, 
I will strengthen comprehensive management of public security, 
deal strict blows to all sorts of criminal activities, and 
maintain social stability. As the saying goes, diligence can 
make up for one's unskillfulness. Although my ability and level 
are limited, I will strive to handle the government work 
diligently, exert my utmost efforts, and devote more time and 
energy to managing each and every work well in order to make up 
for the deficiencies in my ability level. I will exercise 
strict self-discipline by using the tenet of being realistic in 
ideology and practical in work style and doing solid work and 
concentrate the major energy and attention on solving practical 
problems that affect the overall situation. As long as the work 
style of working hard and being steadfast in work and plain in 
living is formed and maintained in the government and its 
functionaries, the government will surely become one enjoying 
trust from the people and support from the masses. 
  Chairman, fellow vice chairmen, secretary general, and all 
committee members, I heartily thank the chairmanship meeting of 
the provincial people's congress standing committee for 
nominating me as the candidate for acting governor. If my 
appointment has been approved, I will act according to my 
report, match my words with my deeds, perform my duties well, 
speak less and work more, and undertake this historical heavy 
task with untiring efforts. If my appointment has been 
declined, I will continue to work hard as before, and will not 
disappoint your great expectations on me. 
  Thank your very much.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Clashes between National 
Assembly members of the ruling Kuomintang [KMT] and main 
opposition Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] turned worse 
Wednesday [1 Jun], totally paralyzing the morning session. 
  Two DPP deputies were slightly injured during the fighting 
and sent to hospitals for treatment, the DPP said. 
  Disputing the quorum standard for starting the first-reading 
session to consider proposed amendments to the constitution, 
deputies from the two parties have engaged in free-for-alls 
every day since last Friday, kicking, punching, and chasing each 
other around the conference hall in the otherwise serene Taipei 
suburb of Yangmingshan. 
  The DPP has been insisting that the quorum must be 
two-thirds 
of the deputies, but the KMT has said one-third of members would 
be sufficient to proceed with the session. 
  No longer than one minute after the morning session started 
Wednesday, DPP deputies again rushed the podium and staged a 
sit-in, as they have done in previous days. 
  While KMT deputy Kuo Po-tsun, who was the day's chairman, 
stood on a table in an attempt to announce the commencement of 
proceedings, DPP members were shouting and whistling in protest. 
  Angered by the tactics of the DPP members, several KMT 
deputies rushed to the podium to remove them, which resulted in 
several shoving, kicking, and wrestling matches. 
  The two parties, however, later reached agreement in 
negotiations between their whips to appeal the quorum-standard 
question to a court of grand justices. The settlement enabled 
the National Assembly to go ahead with its afternoon session.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang [KMT] 
is scheduled to partially reshuffle its policy-making Central 
Standing Committee in August, party sources said Wednesday [1 
Jun]. 
  The second conference of the party's Central Committee and 
Central Advisory Committee will meet on Aug. 26-27 to elect 15 
Central Committee members to fill seats in the Central Standing 
Committee, they said. The 15 currently serving Central Standing 
Committee members may be re-elected. 
  The remaining 16 Central Standing Committee members were 
appointed by the KMT's chairman, ROC [Republic of China] 
president, last year, and will serve until the next party 
congress. 
  More than 800 members of the two committees and ranking 
party 
officials will take part in the August conference, which will be 
held at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei. The KMT 
held the first such meeting last August. 
  The conference will hear reports on political and party 
affairs, cross-strait relations and international politics.

  [Text] Taipei, June 2 (CNA) -- Fu Chun-fan, new president 
of China Airlines (CAL), said Thursday [2 Jun] that CAL will 
stress air safety following the CAL plane crash in Japan in 
April. 
  Fu made the remarks when he took over the CAL presidency 
from 
Yuan Hsing-yuan, who resigned earlier to take responsibility for 
the tragic disaster in Nagoya, Japan in which 264 of the 271 
aboard were killed. 
  Fu, 52, said air safety will be CAL's top priority and CAL 
will also work to provide the best service to passengers. He 
stressed that stringent safety standards requirements will help 
ensure air safety. 
  Fu, who first served as a CAL counter clerk in 1966, becomes 
the first civilian to take the CAL's helm. 
  Fu also took the opportunity to refute reports in the United 
States media that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
will suspend CAL flights to the United States because of the 
Nagoya crash. 
  Fu said that Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator, 
was misquoted in THE WASHINGTON POST, which reported on the FAA 
decision. 
  Fu also voiced his discontent over Japanese media reports 
that have not been confirmed by a Japanese task force 
investigating the cause of the air crash. 
  Fu said Japanese reports that traces of alcohol had been 
found in the blood of the pilot and co-pilot of the ill-fated 
plane were not only unfair to CAL but also a serious violation 
of international practice. 
  Fu said that he has conveyed his discontent to the special 
task force in Japan. This is the first time a high-ranking CAL 
official has openly voiced discontent about Japanese media 
reports on the disaster. 
  During the change over ceremony Wednesday, Chiang Hung-yi 
took over the post of CAL chairman from Liu The-min. 
  Chiang, 68, said that his top priority will be to deal with 
the aftermath of the Nagoya plane crash and to step up air 
safety.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>
  [Text] Taiwan's Vice-Premier Hsu Li-teh described a recent 
British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee's 
report as encouraging, saying it was a new development in 
British policy towards the island republic. 
  The report, issued in mid-April, urges the British 
government 
to strengthen ties with Taipei, Beijing's rival, in a move 
described by some observers as playing the Taiwan card. 
  In a meeting with a visiting delegation of Hong Kong media 
executives, Mr Hsu said Taipei's reaction to the British 
parliament report was positive. But, according to him, the 
Executive Yuan, Taiwan's cabinet, has yet to study the thick 
document. 
  "The report indicated something new in British foreign 
policy 
towards the Republic of China," Mr Hsu said. 
  China reacted furiously to the House of Commons 110-page 
report on China including Hong Kong and Taiwan, criticising it 
as an "infringement" of its internal affairs. 
  The vice-premier dismissed suggestions that Britain was 
playing the Taiwan card to improve its position in dealing with 
China over thorny Hong Kong issues. 
  Mr Hsu said Taiwan was eager to strengthen ties with all the 
western nations including Britain but relations between the 
island republic and the United Kingdom have not been smooth in 
years. 
  He said one of the major targets of Taiwan's diplomatic 
strategy was to fight for larger international space and 
increased communications and exchanges with the world community. 
However, the vice premier said Taiwan's relations with the 
British could be influenced by two crucial factors -- the 
relationship between the two rivals across the Taiwan straits 
and that between Beijing and London. 
  He said Taiwan's foreign policy was not hostile towards the 
mainland communist regime. Rather, it was aimed at ensuring the 
survival and development of the island. 
  "We have no desire to produce a foreign policy that is 
hostile towards the mainland and what we are exploring in the 
process of policy-making is to seek survival and development for 
the island," he said. The senior ruling Kuomintang party 
official said he was optimistic about the prospect of 
reunification with mainland China and he himself was ready to 
return to and live on the mainland once the dream of 
reunification was realised. 
  "I am very optimistic about the prospect because changes 
have 
been going on rapidly," he said. 
  Mr Hsu said he would like to be a mainlander rather than a 
Taiwanese. 
  Among the preconditions for reunification are the narrowing 
of living standards, lifestyles, ideology and social systems.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou said Wednesday [1 Jun] that there are 200,000 drug 
abusers and traffickers in Taiwan, and that the drug problem on 
the island has reached an alarming state. 
  Ma, speaking to the press two days before a national 
anti-drug conference is set to start, said, that although the 
supply and use of amphetamines had dropped 20 percent in the 
first four months this year, the first such decrease since 1990, 
the supply and use of heroin has increased 66 percent. 
  Despite the jump in heroin use, though, he claimed that 
illicit drugs are reportedly in short supply -- a sign that the 
war on drugs declared by Premier Lien Chan last year has begun 
to show results. 
  Ma reported that the supply of drugs was at its highest 
level 
last year, when law enforcement authorities seized 1,110 
kilograms of heroin and 3,375 kilograms of amphetamines. 
  He said 47,000 inmates in Taiwan prisons last year, or 31 
percent of the prison population, were in for drug-related 
crimes. The figure was several times that of the past few 
years, he said, adding that drug-related crimes have taken 
precedence over theft and robbery. 
  Speaking on the strategy to combat the drug problem, Ma said 
the Justice Ministry would draft a law to prevent drug kingpins 
from laundering drug money, and will target specific age groups 
in its anti-drug drive. 
  Statistics show that 30 percent of drug-related crimes in 
the 
first four months this year were committed by people aged 
between 12 and 24 years old.

  [Text] San Salvador, May 31 (CNA) -- In a bid to further 
help Taiwan investors in El Salvador, the government is 
considering designating a trade representative in its embassy 
here, Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang said Tuesday [31 
May]. 
  Chiang, who is accompanying Premier Lien Chan on his May 
29-June 7 Central American tour, said investors from the 
Republic of China [ROC], especially textile, footware and 
umbrella makers, should consider El Salvador when choosing 
overseas production sites, given that labor and production costs 
in many Southeast Asian countries are rising. 
  Although many investors who have set up businesses here have 
lauded the favorable investment climate, the ROC Government 
believes assigning a trade representative will be necessary to 
help increase the number of Taiwan investors interested in 
expanding into El Salvador, Chiang said. 
  Chiang said the government will decide on whether to assign 
a 
trade representative to El Salvador after he holds talks with 
Ambassador Andrew J. P. Shen and Taiwan investors in the country. 
  Currently, ROC diplomatic missions in Panama, Guatemala, 
Costa Rica, and Honduras include a trade representative. 
  Meanwhile, newly designated Salvadoran Foreign Affairs 
Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamaria and Economic Affairs Minister 
Luis Enrique Cordova, said the newly installed government of 
President Armando Calderon Sol will take measures to simplify 
visa procedures for ROC citizens as a way of attracting more 
Taiwan investment, which he said creates jobs and helps upgrade 
living standards here. 
  As ROC agricultural missions stationed here have contributed 
a great deal to the social and economic development in El 
Salvador, bilateral ties between the two countries should be 
further boosted, Cordova said. 
  The new Salvadoran Government will also send ranking 
officials to Taiwan to hold investment seminars as a way of 
attracting additional investors, he added.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- A legislative group left 
for Tokyo Wednesday [1 Jun] afternoon to discuss with the 
Japanese Government the reimbursement of salaries of Taiwanese 
soldiers forced to serve in the Japanese army during World War 
II. 
  The leader of the group, Vice Legislative Speaker Wang 
Chin-ping, said consultations would be on already-confirmed 
debts, and that the Taiwan delegation would ask, on behalf of an 
association formed by the Taiwanese soldiers and their 
relatives, for compensation 7,000 times the soldiers' original 
salaries. 
  Wang said the demand is many times what the Japanese 
Government has said it would pay -- about 100 times the original 
salaries -- and that therefore, no concrete results are expected. 
  Although not expecting any breakthrough in this trip, he 
said 
he would try his best to make Japan realize the urgency of the 
matter and his hope for an early resolution. 
  Wang said the group would meet Thursday with Japanese 
officials on reparations, and will also call on leaders of the 
Japanese Diet during their stay. 
  Wang and his group will return to Taipei on Sunday.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, an 
economist-turned banker, took the helm of the Central Bank of 
China (CBC) Wednesday [1 Jun] amid high expectations. 
  Liang, 64, took over from Samuel Shieh, whose five-year term 
expired Tuesday. 
  A trusted economic adviser to President Li Teng-hui, Liang 
is 
the first native Taiwanese to fill the governor's post. 
  With a doctorate in economics, Liang has spent most of his 
career in banking and is considered by many as an enlightened 
banker who believes the central bank should adjust its policies 
in line with market forces. 
  Speaking at the changeover ceremony attended by hundreds of 
well-wishers, Liang said he will continue to promote financial 
liberalization and internationalization during his five-year 
tenure. 
  He said he will first seek to develop Taiwan into a regional 
"funding center" to provide capital for financial institutions 
and private enterprises at home and abroad. "I think this is 
not a difficult goal to reach as we already have a foreign 
currency call-loan market that allow banks to borrow and lend 
from each other," Liang explained. 
  He said he will push for faster liberalization of the local 
financial service markets, allowing more foreign banks to set up 
branches in Taiwan. "The entry of more foreign banks will 
facilitate our bid to become a regional funding center and 
eventually a regional financial hub," he noted. 
  Liang also said he will maintain the current "measured" easy 
credit policy, but will tighten monitoring of lending practices 
of local banks to ensure that new bank loans, particularly 
medium and long-term loans, are extended to the manufacturing 
sector to bolster domestic economic development. 
  As the Taiwan economy has failed to recover as fast as 
expected, Liang said the central bank may induce further 
reductions in local interest rates to prod private investment 
willingness. 
  Noting that the central bank's most important responsibility 
is to maintain price stability, Liang said he won't sit idle and 
let the local currency's value drop drastically simply because 
of market speculation. 
  He said that although the local currency's 2.4 percent 
depreciation over the past month may benefit exporters, it may 
also fuel inflationary pressure and thus destabilize commodity 
price stability and hinder economic growth. 
  In addition, Liang said, he will make the central bank's 
policy-making process clear to the public, and will upgrade its 
level of professionalism and protect it from political 
interference. He also promised to let more people with a 
reputation for specialized knowledge and integrity take part in 
the bank's decision-making process.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan's semiconductor 
industry will take a vital step forward when the 
government-financed integrated-circuit development project, 
after four years of research, transfers its sophisticated 
technology to a spinoff company in October. 
  The project, which has cost the government NT [new Taiwan] 
$6 
billion (US$222.22 million) since it started four years ago, has 
successfully developed the technology used in the manufacture of 
16- megabyte dynamic random-access memory chips and 
four-megabyte static random-access memory chips. 
  "Transferring the hard-won technology to a private company 
would be the best approach to get back the research funds," an 
official with the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said. 
  According to the proposal presented by the IDB, the 
state-of-the-art technology, together with an experimental 
integrated-circuit factory in the Hsinchu Science-Based 
Industrial Park, will be transferred to a new privately run 
company, in which the government will have a 49 percent stake. 
  Local enterprises are welcome to bid to take the remaining 
51 
percent stake in the company, the IDB official said, adding that 
prospective investors are required to submit their bids before 
June 30. 
  All the bidders will be judged by not only bidding prices 
but 
their management and marketing plans, as well as their financial 
status, according to the official. 
  The evaluation will be completed in early September. A 
joint-venture agreement will be signed within a month after the 
winning bid is made public on Sept. 8.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The state-run Chinese 
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said Wednesday [1 Jun] it will step up 
investments in Vietnam in tandem with the government's "southern 
strategy." 
  "With the anticipated liberalization of the local oil 
market, 
the CPC has to go international while trying to consolidate its 
local market share," CPC Chairman Chang Tzu-yuan said in a 
speech marking the CPC's 48th anniversary. For now, the CPC is 
Taiwan's sole oil supplier. 
  The CPC, along with France-based Total Oil Company, signed a 
contract with Vietnamese authorities in February to build a 
refinery there, pending the results of a feasibility study on 
the construction site, likely environmental impact, and other 
factors. 
  Construction of the refinery is expected to begin soon after 
the feasibility study is completed early next year, and the 
refinery, with a daily capacity of 130,000 barrels, would begin 
commercial operations in 1999. 
  Some of the oil products produced by the refinery may be 
shipped back for local consumption, according to Chang.

  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- If calculated on the basis 
of market value, betel nut is the top agricultural item in 
Taiwan, officials of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said 
Wednesday [1 Jun]. 
  Taiwan currently boasts about 64.5 million betel palms, they 
pointed out, adding that if each palm produces 413 nuts each 
year, annual output tops 26.63 billion nuts. 
  If each betel nut sells at NT$2 (us$0.074), the total annual 
value will reach NT [new Taiwan] $53.26 billion (US$1.97 
billion), much higher than NT$35 billion (US$1.31 billion) in 
annual rice production, they elaborated. 
  In fact, they said, a betel nut sometimes sells for as high 
as NT$20 (US$0.74). Judging from the market value, it is no 
surprise why the betel nut has been touted as the "green 
diamond" here, they noted. 
  The officials pointed out that a growing number of people 
here have a penchant for chewing betel nuts, which is known as 
"Taiwan's chewing gum." 
  The number of betel nut chewers, which totaled about 1.8 
million in 1990, might soar to 2.8 million in 1994, they noted. 
  Betel nut has also replaced sugarcane as Taiwan's second 
largest agricultural item in terms of production area, while 
rice remains on top, the COA officials added. 
  Citing the 1993 annual report on agriculture issued by the 
Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the 
officials said the size of betel nut plantations increased from 
5,772 hectares in 1983 to 41,535 hectares in 1992, marking a 
nearly eight-fold jump in nine years. 
  The dramatic increase in the size of betel nut plantations 
was fueled by market demand despite the government's "three-no" 
policy towards the nut. The policy stipulates no prohibition, 
no encouragement, and no promotion of betel nut use, they said.

<F P=106> [By Sally Blyth] </F>
  [Text] The Government has turned down measures to protect 
human rights and increase freedom of information because of 
fears of upsetting China. 
  Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary, yesterday told a private 
meeting of legislators that the Government had no intention of 
supporting legislation that would establish a human rights 
commission and introduce an access to information bill. Sources 
said that the Chief Secretary admitted that China "had a direct 
bearing on the situation". 
  This is the first time the Government has officially 
admitted 
this and contradicts earlier suggestions that pressure from 
China was not an important factor. Officially, the Government 
says that it is still considering a number of proposals and that 
an announcement will be made tomorrow. The Government will 
announce a package of other anti-discrimination measures. 
  Chan made it clear to legislators that the Government would 
not support the human rights commission proposal tabled by the 
legislator Anna Wu and recommended by the House of Commons 
foreign affairs select committee in recent report. She also 
said the Government would reject the proposal for an access to 
information bill put forward by the legislative councillor 
Christine Loh. 
  Instead, the Government will announce tomorrow that it will 
incorporate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women into Hong Kong law. This is a UN 
convention, which China has signed. The Government is believed 
to be in favour of drafting new laws against discrimination on 
the grounds of sex, age or disability. In addition it will 
propose the establishment of an equal opportunities commission. 
  These measures will not go even half way to meeting 
campaigners' demands for more laws to protect human rights. 
  Liberal minded legislators are likely to be most angered by 
the Government's admission that it is bowing to pressure from 
China over the issue. Wu last night accused the Governor, Chris 
Patten, of reversing his previous policy of standing up to 
Beijing. 
  She reiterated her view that the Government should first 
consider the opinions of the Legislative Council, which she is 
convinced would support her proposals. Earlier in the week the 
Executive Council gave an initial thumbs down to the idea of a 
human rights commission. 
  It is believed that the Government's willingness to bend to 
the wishes of China is prompted by a wish for a thaw in 
relations, following the row over political reform. It is 
feared that any moves that go against China's wishes on human 
rights could jeopardise an agreement with China on the new 
airport and other key economic issues. 
  Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Aifairs 
Office, hit out last month at proposals by legislators to 
protect against human rights abuses. He said that a human 
rights commission would violate the Basic Law and be dismantled 
by Beijing after the 1997 handover. 
  Patten has criticised the proposal on other grounds, arguing 
that a human rights commission would cost the Government $60m 
and would be bureaucratic and toothless. 
  Officials have used similar arguments in opposition to Loh's 
access to information bill, which they say would strain the 
already limited resources of the civil service.

  [Text] Corrupt senior mainland officials may expect to get 
away with abusing their power in Hong Kong after 1997, a top 
anti-corruption officer warned yesterday. 
  "With the passage of 1997 we know China is worried about how 
some of its senior officials use of their official positions," 
Tony Scott, the director of corruption prevention at the 
Independent Commission Against Corruption, said. "They might 
say, `We can go and do the same thing in Hong Kong'. That could 
be a worry and one which I have heard expressed by people on the 
mainland." 
  Scott was confident that any top-level corruption would be 
unlikely to spread. 
  "If they do behave in that way (abusing power) then that 
could happen," he said. 
  "Hopefully the Special Administrative Region and our 
regulatory controls will ensure it doesn't happen. They are 
quite good at finding out when people are doing things which are 
wrong, unethical, criminal or outside the rules, and putting it 
right. 
  "It is an area which I think is potentially more worrying 
than the growth of ordinary corruption in Hong Kong. 
  "At this point I would say it is a slightly larger threat 
than Hong Kong people turning to corruption." 
  Scott said corruption complaints in the territory jumped 
from 
1,542 to 1,940 in the first three months of 1994, compared with 
the same period last year. 
  He was sure the amount of graft would not change 
significantly after the handover of sovereignty. 
  Scott claimed China was serious about tackling corruption, 
citing recent wideranging laws with heavy penalties for state 
officials.

  [Text] Beijing is planning to set up a newspaper in Hong 
Kong as pressure mounts on the territory's media to tone down 
criticism of its future landlord. 
  The Hong Kong Special Region Daily will be published under 
the direct control of the Chinese Communist Party after 1997. 
  The move would contravene repeated assurances by Beijing 
that 
the party would be barred from operating in the territory after 
the handover. In addition, a privately funded pro-China 
newspaper, the Mirror Daily, will be set up in 1996. 
  The two papers are expected to serve as models for what 
Beijing considers appropriate interpretation of Hong Kong press 
freedom without undermining socialism on the mainland. 
According to the China watching monthly Open Magazine [KAI 
FANG], the Hong Kong Special Region Daily will "completely 
reflect Beijing's point of view". 
  It said the move was part of overall plans to restrict press 
freedom in the territory after 1997 out of fears that excessive 
criticism of Beijing could topple the communist government. Top 
media cadres from the mainland would be selected to serve as 
senior editors at the paper. 
  Sources said that reporters for the new paper were already 
being trained during short stays at pro-China newspapers in Hong 
Kong. A senior deputy editor at Ta Kung Pao, Lu Fuwei, who is 
in poor health, is expected to be replaced by a top mainland 
cadre who would double as the new paper's preparatory head in 
Hong Kong, the sources said. 
  While at least five pro-Beijing papers already exist in Hong 
Kong, Beijing has become concerned about growing signs of 
independence, reflected in the strong reaction to the 12-year 
sentence handed down to the Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang. 
  Even Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, which have direct links to 
the Communist Party's propaganda department in Beijing, printed 
editorials critical of the sentence. 
  A prominent local pro-China figure, Xu Simin [publisher of 
the journal CHING PAO], said his new paper, the Mirror Daily, 
would be "patriotic and outspoken".

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Six senior journalists at ATV [Asia Television] 
decided yesterday to leave the station, even though the 
management capitulated in a row over the screening of a film on 
the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  They had handed in their notice after the management moved 
to 
prevent the previously unreleased footage of the crackdown being 
screened late on Saturday night, almost five years to the hour 
since troops began moving against the pro-democracy movement. 
  After a meeting with senior management yesterday, the six 
members of the News and Public Affairs Department said they 
would stick to their decision to resign. They agreed to stay on 
until their replacements have been hired. 
  The 40-minute documentary, which features seven minutes of 
film taken by a Spanish news team from the Monument to the 
People's Heroes in the early hours of June 4, 1989, will go to 
air as they had planned. The ATV management originally ordered 
the suspension of the film last week, but later suggested that 
it could be screened at another time slot. On Tuesday [31 May], 
it backed down amid a public outcry over apparent 
self-censorship. 
  The company management yesterday rejected suggestions that 
it 
had decided to ban the film. Chief executive officer Mark Lee 
Po-on and deputy chief executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who 
flew from Taiwan to attend the meeting, said that no final 
decision on how the documentary should be handled was ever made 
before late on Tuesday. 
  Mr Lee said the final decision then was that the news 
division could decide where to place the documentary. He said 
ATV chairman Lim Poy-yen was in support of the management's 
decision and was well-informed of the incident since it began. 
  The Governor, Chris Patten, said it was "very sad" for six 
senior journalists to resign from ATV. Noting the importance of 
a free exchange of ideas, Mr Patten said it was also important 
to keep management and editorial functions in any media 
organisation separate. 
  The Hong Kong Journalists' Association also expressed sorrow 
at the resignations, saying that they were a result of the lack 
of sincerity on the side of the management. The journalists, 
all in top positions, said the conflict between their and 
management's versions of the incident had made it difficult for 
them to stay with the company, 
  "It has destroyed the basis of mutual trust and 
cooperation," 
said acting news controller Poon Fu-yim. "We can see we have no 
mutual trust, they are saying one thing and we are saying 
another thing. They say their version is correct but we don't 
agree," said Poon. 
  Also resigning were assistant news controller Selina Li 
Yuk-lin, executive editor Lo Wing-hung, managing editor Lui 
Wan-sang, assignment editor Choy Pui-ying and city editor Lau 
Kok-wa. 
  "We feel our independence, our editorial policy, has been 
tampered with that's why we are leaving," Poon said. He said 
although a few more staff members might follow suit, most people 
in the news division were watching developments calmly. 
  Speaking at a press conference, Mr Lee rejected any claims 
that the management had ever come to a decision that the film 
should not be screened. Mr Lee said the journalists had 
submitted their resignation on a premature decision that the 
film would be screened on One Day programme instead of the 
current affairs programme News Magazine. 
  "We tried to put our suggestion to our colleagues in the 
news 
division that it would not be appropriate for the film to be 
shown in News Magazine, which is a current affairs programme to 
update the audience with the latest development of events," Mr 
Lee said. "If the film is about events happening in 1989, it is 
a documentary," he added. 
  Mr Lee denied the incident had anything to do with the 
independence of ATV's news division. "We place full trust on 
our colleagues in the news division. This is just a very, very 
unique case." 
  He said it was because of the very "suspenseful" nature of 
the film that special attention had been paid to it by the 
management. 
  "We are all curious about it. It presents a theory different 
from what we were told," Mr Lee said. 
  He denied that Chinese authorities had been informed of the 
purchase of the documentary, which tends to support the Chinese 
Government's insistence that no one was killed in Tiananmen 
Square. 
  Mr Chang would not explain his views on the documentary. 
  "News judgment is a very subjective thing," he said. 
  He rejected a claim that he had stated there was no way the 
company would change its mind regardless of any resignations.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman reiterated here today that China's position 
favoring a proper settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogues and consultations remains unchanged. 
  Spokesman Shen Guofang made the remarks here this afternoon 
when asked to comment on the difficulties emerging in the 
settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not reach any 
agreement on inspection of the replacement of fuel rods. 
  "There have re-emerged some difficulties on the solution of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, and this is a 
situation China is very concerned about," Shen said. 
  The spokesman noted that the key at present is that parties 
directly involved should treat the issue with calmness, and make 
positive efforts in order to leave room and keep possibility 
alive for a proper settlement. 
  China's position favoring a proper settlement of the issue 
through dialogues and consultations remains unchanged, he 
pointed out. 
  The spokesman said that the only goal of China on this issue 
is to realize a denuclearization and safeguard peace and 
stability on the Korean peninsular, and it is in the interests 
of all.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren today expressed the hope that more business people 
from U.S. securities circles will become involved in China's 
infrastructure construction and invest in more fields. 
  Meeting here today with John Chalsty, president of the 
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation, Rong said 
China has a huge market and its investment environment is 
improving, adding that from both present and long-term points of 
view, the prospect of trade and cooperation in economy and 
technology between the two countries is promising. 
  The Chinese vice-president considered it wise that President 
Clinton recently declared the extension of China's MFN 
[most-favored nation] status and the termination of linking the 
MFN issue to human rights, saying that this decision is in line 
with fundamental interests of the two peoples and is beneficial 
to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving the two countries' 
relations. 
  Rong expressed his thanks for the work that Chalsty's firm 
had done in extending China's MFN status. 
  He told Chalsty that the measures China has adopted this 
year 
in the reform of finance, taxes, planning, investments and 
foreign trade are going smoothly. The state revenue has 
increased and foreign exchange rate is stable, he said. 
  Although prices have risen, Rong said, the Chinese 
Government 
has taken effective measures to control the prices. 
  Rong pointed out that the current work of the government is 
focusing on handling well the relations between reform, 
development and stability. 
  Chalsty said he had held successful talks with relevant 
Chinese departments.

  [Text] Brussels, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The European Union (EU) 
has further demonstrated its support for China's bid to rejoin 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Following three days of talks in Brussels between Chinese 
trade representatives and the EU, Roderick Abbott, the Union's 
director to the GATT, said that resumption of China's GATT 
membership would be a significant move, especially for its 
founding membership of a World Trade Organization to be set up 
early next year. 
  The EU has backed measures for the completion of 
negotiations 
which could see China voted back into the trade group by the end 
of this year. 
  Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation, said "important 
progress" was made in the talks, which ended today, and that the 
two sides had reached understanding about most of the protocol 
articles for China's reinstatement. 
  But he said there was still some differences such as easing 
China's foreign trade restrictions. Talks will resume in a 
month in a bid to solve these issues.

Poland and China are striving for peace and development. 
  Oleksy, who is leading a delegation on a visit to China, 
made 
the remarks at a press conference before leaving for Shanghai, 
China's largest industrial center. 
  He said his talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin were

fields as politics, economy, culture and science and 
technology," he added. 
  The speaker held that there is great potential in the 
development of Poland-China relations, saying that the two 
countries can cooperate in the areas of coal, chemicals and 
precision instruments, in which Poland has advanced technology. 
  He also expressed the hope that the two countries will make 
efforts to set up more joint ventures, hoping that the banks of 
the two countries will open branches in each other's capitals. 
  He revealed that Polish entrepreneurs in his entourage had 
held talks with their Chinese counterparts and some of them were 
ready to strike deals.

<F P=106> [By staff correspondent Ma Ling (7456 3781): "Deng Xiaoping </F>
on Zhang Baifa--"The Captain? He Will Do"] 
  [Text] In March 1990, six months before the Asian Games was 
due to open in Beijing, the Asian Games Village then under 
construction was taking shape. Deng Xiaoping, who had been 
following the village and the entire games project with keen 
interest, suggested a visit to the capital, stating also that he 
did not want the tour to be guided by municipal leaders because 
he was only a common person and an official-conducted tour would 
not be appropriate. An idea flashed through the mind of his 
secretary, who said: "Then let Zhang Baifa accompany you." At 
that Deng Xiaoping said crisply and without hesitation: "The 
captain? He will do." 
  We need to know that in 1958 Zhang Baifa, together with 
others, had once briefed Deng Xiaoping on his work in the 
capacity of a national model laborer and captain of an elite 
worker contingent. On that occasion Deng stressed to them the 
necessity of being versatile workers. The "captain" in Deng's 
mind was naturally a memory from that occasion. However, 
although Zhang Baifa has risen through the hierarchy to his 
current position, he still retains the "demeanor of an ordinary 
citizen," which was probably why Deng Xiaoping remarked that "he 
will do." 
  Deng Xiaoping was also very much interested in Beijing's 
architecture; and through his appreciation and concern for the 
municipality's buildings, he came to understand Zhang Baifa 
better. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping told Zhang Baifa and other people 
on a tour of residential buildings on the Qianmen thoroughfare: 
"The ceiling of each storey need not be too high. This is not 
because I am short; if I am going to spend the same amount of 
money, I would rather make the room bigger than increase its 
headroom. There should also be a shower and other installations 
for daily use." 
  Deng Xiaoping made another "foray" on 31 October 1993 to 
take 
a look at the municipality. "Captain" Zhang Baifa again acted 
as an escort. The ordinary-looking minibus Deng Xiaoping and 
his entourage traveled in crisscrossed Beijing's heavy traffic. 
In the car were also his family and personal guards. Along the 
way Zhang Baifa explained to Deng Xiaoping the capital's latest 
buildings and talked with him on the level of moderate 
prosperity people enjoyed. 
  During last year's autumn excursion to the capital, Deng 
said 
that he intended to invite the "captain" to accompany him on 
another tour of the capital's latest modern shopping malls in 
1994. Zhang Baifa is prepared for that.

<F P=106> [By Tiffany Bown] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (AFP)--A steely security net has 
descended on Beijing this week as China's nervous leadership 
moves to ensure that nobody rocks the boat on the fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. Hundreds of plainclothes 
police roam Tiananmen Square -- the vast focal point of the 
spring 1989 pro-democracy protests, crushed by the army on June 
4 that year -- ready to nip in the bud any undesirable 
commemorative activities. 
  Easily recognisable by their straw hats, dark glasses, and 
two-way radios, the uncomfortable-looking officers mingle among 
the crowds of Chinese families, moving in quickly to videotape 
the movements of any suspicious-looking characters -- such as 
camera-wielding foreign journalists. 
  "They seem to be more nervous this year than ever," said one 
diplomat, putting the official paranoia down to fears of 
instability amid rising social discontent and concern about the 
health of 89-year-old patriach Deng Xiaoping. 
  The city is crawling with uniformed officers from its 
50,000-strong People's Armed Police (PAP) force, developed since 
1989 into a strong riot-control unit able to put down 
disturbances without calling on the Army -- whose unsuitability 
for dealing with civil unrest led to the June 4 bloodshed. But, 
should the PAP fail to restore order quickly, the authorities 
appear ready to resort to extreme measures again. President 
Jiang Zemin recently credited the "resolute measures" taken by 
the Army in 1989 for China's present stability. 
  Security is particularly tight around the homes of 
dissidents 
and their families -- with whom some foreign journalists, under 
an obscure regulation, were recently warned to break all contact 
or face the consequences. Many dissidents are already in 
detention after an intensive police sweep that began in the 
spring following the most significant resurgence in their 
activities since 1989. Others, including Tiananmen leader Wang 
Dan, have left the capital temporarily, either at the orders of 
the authorities or simply to avoid harassment. Those who remain 
complain that their every move is being watched. 
  Ding Zilin, a People's University professor whose son was 
shot by soldiers in 1989, was preparing Thursday to launch a 
hunger strike in the evening to protest the intensive police 
surveillance of her home. Ding's husband Jiang Peikuang said 
police had warned friends who also lost relatives in the 
massacre not to join them. 
  The northwestern university district, base in 1989 of the 
protests' student leaders, is another focus for police 
attention. Everyone entering university compounds must now show 
their identity cards, while several student activists have been 
sent home early for the holidays. "They're erring on the side 
of caution, on the side of stupidity -- no one wants to be 
responsible for letting things get out of control," said a 
diplomat. 
  Such "stupidity" is reflected in an apparent directive to 
stop all and any large gatherings -- even if most people present 
are likely to be foreigners. In recent days, an 
innocuous-sounding foreign-embassy bazaar in a five-star hotel 
was threatened with closure, a painting exhibition by a 
diplomat's wife cancelled, an embassy party in one park banned, 
and a foreign journalist's party in another scuppered by an 
electricity overload and police road block. 
  "Their tactics have changed since 1989 -- now they are 
simply 
not going to allow people to get together," the diplomat said. 
Their tactics also include efforts to temporarily diffuse 
popular tension over high inflation and other social ills by 
reimposing price controls here on a range of staple goods, while 
ensuring that the capital's shops are particularly well-stocked. 
"Lots of luxury items that are usually quite difficult to come 
by are suddenly in the shops at very cheap prices," said one 
Beijing resident. 
  Should these efforts to lull the population into a sense of 
well-being fail to dissuade any foolhardy individuals from 
commemorating the Tiananmen Massacre openly, the forces are now 
in place to deal with them quickly and severely.

<F P=106> [Article by Huang Zhiling from the "Opinion" page: "Hi-tech </F>
Imports Safeguarded by State Patent Law"] 
  [Text] Strict measures are needed to prevent intellectual 
fraud of technological imports, said an official from the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC). 
  China started drafting laws on intellectual property 
protection at the advent of reform in 1979, said Zhao Chunhua, 
deputy director of MOFTEC's Department of Science and Technology. 
  A Trademark Law became effective in 1982, a Patent Law in 
1984, a Copyright Law in 1991 and an Anti-Unethical Competition 
Law in 1993. 
  Marking the advent of China's legal system on intellectual 
property, the four laws also provide a legal basis for 
protecting intellectual property of imported technology. 
  If the supplier fails to provide sufficient proof of holding 
the rights of that patented technology, it will be banned from 
entering China--even if this would mean the loss of potentially 
huge profits, Zhao said. 
  Before importing any patented foreign technology, the 
Chinese 
recipient is required to sign a contract with the foreign 
supplier specifying the scope and duration of the use of the 
technology. 
  The move is aimed at preventing proliferation of the use of 
the patented foreign technology, said Zhao. 
  Since secrecy is all important to technological advantage, a 
foreign supplier is allowed to impose reasonable restrictions on 
people who have access to the technological know-how, and place 
reasonable restrictions on areas where products made with that 
know-how are sold, said Zhao. 
  Computer software is of particular concern in this regard. 
  Protection of computer software is included in the Copyright 
Law. And in 1991, the more specific Regulations on Computer 
Software Protection were passed. 
  In recent years, the licensed trade volume of computer 
software has increased around the world. China's trade volume 
in computer software has soared beyond several hundred million 
dollars. 
  In computer software import, China permits foreign software 
owners to register their own accord in computer software 
registration and management centres in China. 
  Prohibition and punishment will result from pirating foreign 
computer software, said Zhao. 
  If disputes over intellectual property arise over imported 
technology, the two parties concerned should first try to 
negotiate an amicable settlement themselves. 
  "If negotiations fail," Zhao said, "they may request 
arbitration, or start legal proceedings in the intellectual 
property divisions of Chinese courts." 
  Last July, the Beijing Higher People's Court and the Beijing 
Intermediate People's Court set up China's first intellectual 
property divisions in their courts. 
  Five provinces and eight cities have followed Beijing's 
example by establishing special courts to deal with legal 
proceedings arising from intellectual property disputes. 
  Between 1986 and 1993, the courts handled over 3,500 cases 
of 
intellectual property violation. Of these, 1,783 involved 
patent rights, 1,168 copyrights and 554 trademarks. 
  According to Zhao, a Sino-U.S. negotiation agency has been 
set up under the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade. 
  "The agency provides a place where disputes pertaining to 
intellectual property are mediated regularly, thus playing a 
role in settling disputes over intellectual property between the 
two countries," said Zhao. 
  In recent years, China has witnessed a rapid expansion of 
imported technology. 
  Disputes regarding intellectual property did arise in the 
course. But the disputes were few in number, and were settled 
through negotiations, said Zhao. 
  To improve protection of intellectual property in technology 
imports, authorities concerned are drafting Regulations on 
Technology Imports and Exports of the People's Republic of China. 
  The regulations are aimed at bringing technology trade 
closer 
to international conventions, said Zhao.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524) and </F>
correspondent Zhao Peiya (6392 1014 0068)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 31 May (XINHUA) -- China's macroeconomic 
regulation and control has yielded initial results in the field 
of fixed asset investments, with the growth rate of investments 
falling sharply, newly-started construction projects being 
brought under effective control, and the overall investment 
structure showing a noticeable improvement. 
  According to the latest statistics released by the State 
Statistical Bureau, in the first four months of this year, fixed 
asset investments by state-owned units grew 38.4 percent over 
the same period last year, showing a decrease of 30.5 percentage 
points in the growth rate. Of this, the growth rates for 
capital construction and technical transformation investments 
dropped 32.5 and 28.4 percentage points, respectively. What is 
most eye-catching is that the growth rate of real estate 
development investments fell 72.8 percentage points, thus 
further cooling the "heat of real estate markets." 
  While the investment scale was brought under control, the 
growth momentum of newly-started projects nationwide was also 
effectively restrained. In the first four months, a total of 
6,316 state projects involving capital construction and 
technical transformation with an investment of 50,000 yuan or 
more each were launched throughout the country, 1,715 less than 
those of the same period last year; and investments totaled 47.5 
billion yuan, down 32.3 percentage points. A total of 5,106 
local projects were launched, 1,680 less than those of the same 
period last year; and total investments decreased 1.2 percentage 
points. 
  The overall investment structure was improved as compared 
with the same period last year. In the first four months, 
excluding real estate development investments, state-owned units 
invested a total of 1.8 billion yuan in primary industries, up 
13.6 percent. In secondary industries, state-owned units 
invested 60.8 billion yuan, up 27 percent; the ratio of such 
investment to total investment decreased from 56.2 percent to 
52.7 percent. In tertiary industries, state-owned units 
invested 52.8 billion yuan, up 47.5 percent; the ratio of such 
investment to total investment increased from 42 percent to 45.8 
percent. 
  In analyzing Chinese investments in fixed assets, 
authoritative economists said: Despite initial successes in 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the demand for investment 
remains strong in various sectors. It is still rather difficult 
to reduce fixed asset investments to an appropriate scale. 
Localities should not relax their efforts, but should continue 
to resolutely implement the State Council's "circular on 
continuing to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control 
over fixed asset investments." Meanwhile, the relevant 
departments should pay keen attention to and adopt effective 
measures to promptly solve problems related to the western 
region's slow investment growth and lack of funds for a number 
of key construction projects.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5427 2765)] </F>
  [Text] The latest results of the examination by the 
Chinese State Council's inspection team for investment in fixed 
assets in Guangdong, Shanghai, Fujian, Sichuan and 10 other 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions has shown that 
various localities have continued to vie with one another in 
starting new projects and increasing investment to an excessive 
degree. The scale of investment was too large, and the 
distribution of the investment was not rational. The problem 
was rather prominent. The actual amount of investment arranged 
by the state-owned institutions for capital construction in the 
14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions exceeded 
the state plan by $60.9 billion, or 11.7 percent. 
  The State Council leadership stressed the need to increase 
the intensity of macrocontrol this year; otherwise, the gross 
amount of investment in fixed assets this year will exceed the 
planned ceiling of 1,300 billion yuan. 
  The recent inspection found that, although Shanghai, 
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shanxi, and other provinces and 
municipalities arranged their own investment according to the 
state plan, prefectures, cities, and counties increased the 
scale of investment level by level. As a result, the total 
exceeded the plan laid down by the provincial and municipal 
authorities. 
  Another problem found in the inspection was the lack of 
rationality in the distribution of investment, and there was a 
serious degree of duplication of investment in similar projects. 
For example, international airports were built at the same time 
in Xiamen and Fuzhou of Fujian, which are just 300 kilometers 
apart; moreover, Quanzhou, 81 kilometers away from Xiamen, and 
Zhangzhou, closer to Xiamen, also planned to build their own 
airports. Similar infrastructural facilities were built in the 
same area without proper coordination according to local 
capabilities. Duplicated layout of investment was also found in 
Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. 
  The inspection report also pointed out that, because various 
localities vied with one another in starting new investment 
projects, the gross amount of investment continued to swell. 
This took away money and affected the state's key construction 
projects. For example, a city in Henan arranged 30 construction 
projects this year. Only two were state-level key projects and 
seven were provincial-level key projects, with the rest being 
arranged by the city on its own. As localities launched a large 
number of projects on their own, priority was not actually given 
to the state's key projects. 
  As another example, a coastal city planned to rebuild its 
airport, and the state approved 200 million yuan in investment. 
The local government decided to expand the airport according to 
the standard of an international airport, however, and made this 
a fait accompli in order to require that the state authorities 
approve a commercial loan of $90.6 million. The total 
investment thus exceeded 2 billion yuan. According to the 
investigation, the airport project was started even before it 
was approved by the state authorities. 
  The State Planning Commission pointed out that, if this 
year's actual investment exceeded the planned ceiling of 1,300 
billion yuan, it will have serious consequences for China's 
macroeconomic ratios. In particular, as prices are now 
increasing sharply and inflationary pressures are increasing, 
firmly controlling the size of investment in fixed assets has 
become a pressing task of the moment. The projects which should 
be suspended must be resolutely suspended so that the state's 
key construction projects can be actually guaranteed. 
  The local authorities have appropriately centralized 
investment management according to the State Council's 
instruction on further intensifying the state's macro-control 
over investment in fixed assets, and have changed the situation 
in which investment projects were managed by different 
departments without proper coordination.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan on 
Wednesday [1 Jun] threatened to take legal action against the 
Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] for allegedly circulating a 
forged copy of an original memo written by Premier Lien Chan to 
state-run enterprise executives and government officials who are 
KMT [Kuomintang] members, urging them to let KMT legislators 
take a greater part in government construction projects. 
  Two groups of legislators from the DPP, Taiwan's major 
opposition party, on May 25 and May 31 separately showed local 
reporters the document they claimed Lien issued as a Kuomintang 
member. 
  The DPP claimed the document is clear evidence that the 
KMT-controlled administrative branch is trying to convey 
benefits to KMT members, and asked Premier Lien to step down. 
  The Executive Yuan issued a stern warning to the DPP on 
Tuesday and emphasized that the document is fabricated and 
intends to mislead the public. It also vowed to track down 
those involved in circulating the document. 
  Meanwhile, President Li Teng-hui, speaking in his capacity 
as 
KMT chairman before the decision-making Central Standing 
Committee, demanded that an investigation be made into the 
incident to clear Lien's name. 
  Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh told the committee that the document 
displayed by the DPP does not conform to the original written by 
Lien, either by content or by the date it was circulated. 
  Wu Chung-li, the deputy director-general of the Government 
Information Office, announced later in the day that the original 
Lien document will be publicized on Thursday.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Zhu Rongji Says Problems Regarding </F>
Practical Work During Transition Period in Hong Kong Should Be 
Solved as Quickly as Possible"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 31 May (TA KUNG PAO) -- State Council Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji said today that the Chinese side very much 
hopes that some practical issues in Hong Kong can be solved as 
quickly as possible during the transition period and the impact 
of political factors can be minimized, so as to ensure Hong 
Kong's ability to retain its position as a banking and trading 
center in the Asia-Pacific after 1997. Therefore, the Chinese 
side maintains that matters which are not directly connected 
with politics should be handed to the Sino-British Joint Liaison 
Group for deliberation as soon as possible, where a solution can 
be pursued. 
  This remark was made to reporters by Cheng Ming-fun, head of 
the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce board of directors delegation 
to Beijing, after meeting with Zhu Rongji this afternoon. 
  Cheng Ming-fun said: At the meeting, Zhu Rongji pointed out 
that overseas personalities have been paying too much [guo fen 
6665 0118] attention to the overheated development of China's 
economy. Zhu Rongji said: The scale of the large 
infrastructural projects that China conducted last year had 
virtually no match in the world. These projects included the 
construction of 2,000 km of railways and highways, the laying of 
15 million new telephone lines, and the increase of electric 
energy production by 15 million kilowatts. As a result of the 
fast pace of development, economic overheating naturally 
occurred. However, initial results have been achieved through 
the implementation of macroregulation and control measures which 
began last year. For example, the growth rate of capital 
construction was reduced from 70 percent in the year 1992-1993 
to 20-30 percent in the year 1993-1994; the exchange rate of 
renminbi was kept at the level of 8.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar; 
and the growth rate of the money supply was lowered from 100 
percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993. Besides, since the 
tax-sharing system was introduced at the beginning of this year, 
the total tax revenue has increased by 22 percent. These 
figures are a clear indication that China's banking and 
financial sectors are moving toward stability. 
  Cheng Ming-fun said that Zhu Rongji's briefing has boosted 
his confidence in China's economic environment and he believes 
now is a golden time for investing in China. 
  Also, earlier today, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce board 
of directors delegation to Beijing met separately with the 
persons in charge of the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation, exchanging views on economics, trade 
issues, and most-favored-nation trade status.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Pyongyang today 
refuted a report made by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) that the discharge of spent fuel from a nuclear power 
reactor has now made it impossible to select fuel rods for later 
measurements. 
  A spokesman for the General Department of the Atomic Energy 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said the 
operation to discharge the spent fuel in the five megawatt 
nuclear power reactor started from early may for technical or 
safety reasons, the NODONG SINMUN reported today. 
  The whole process is under strict containment and 
surveillance by the IAEA which installed four monitoring 
cameras, he said. 
  "Our core refueling operations are being done in such a 
manner to maintain the ability to take measurements later," the 
spokesman was quoted as saying by the KCNA NEWS AGENCY. 
  He described claims that those later measurements will be 
very difficult as an attempt to internationalize and politicize 
a technical issue to pursue a "sinister political purpose." 
  "If some officials of the agency secretariat declare that 
the 
technical possibility of the future measurement of the fuel rods 
has been lost, we have to take a decisive countermeasure," he 
said. 
  The spokesman urged the IAEA secretariat to return to a fair 
position that is conducive to the settlement of the nuclear 
issue in the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (XINHUA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam has urged U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to disband the U.N. command in South Korea in order 
to establish a new peace arrangement on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Korean newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" reported today that 
Kim, 
also the vice-premier of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), had communicated with Butrus-Ghali on May 28 on 
the issue. 
  Kim said an unstable truce has lasted for more than 40 years 
on the Korean peninsula, but the armistice set up then has now 
lost its validity because the U.S. has been shipping military 
equipment into South Korea. 
  "The situation on the Korean peninsula has become more 
strained and the possibility of an armed conflict is increasing 
as the United States has massed huge reinforcements in and 
around South Korea and stepped up its military action against 
the DPRK," Kim said in the letter to Butrus-Ghali. 
  He said that a new peace agreement is needed in order to 
prevent another war breaking out on the Korean peninsula. 
  In 1992 DPRK and South Korea signed an agreement on 
reconciliation, non-aggression, cooperation and exchange but a 
truce still exists between the DPRK and the United States. 
  Kim declared that the U.N. command was unrelated to the U.N. 
peace-keeping mission in South Korea and serves only U.S. 
strategic aims to isolate and stifle the DPRK and establish 
control over Asia and the Pacific region. 
  In 1975, the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly 
adopted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the U.N. 
command and replacement of the existing armistice with a new 
peace agreement. 
  Kim insisted that the U.N. must pay due attention to the 
DPRK's proposal and take practical measures to disband the U.S. 
command in South Korea. 
  On April 28, the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement, 
proposing the establishment of a new peace mechanism to replace 
the existing Military Armistice Commission (MAC), but the 
proposal received no positive response from the U.S.. 
  U.S. representatives claimed that the question of peace and 
security on the Korean peninsula should be tackled in principle 
through north-south dialogue in accordance with related 
agreements reached by the north and south in February 1992. 
  In another development, the DPRK recalled all the members of 
the Korean People's Army (KPA) from the MAC in May and set up a 
KPA Mission at Panmunjom responsible for contacts with the 
military authorities of the U.S. and South Korea.

  [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin admitted today that the Russian debt to South Korea, 
which stands at 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, 400 million of which 
is overdue, is an impediment to bilateral economic cooperation. 
  Speaking at a joint news conference, the Russian president 
said, "this serious problem impedes progress in major projects 
undertaken by the two states." 
  He cited as an example the construction of a gas pipeline 
from the Siberian republic of Yakutiya to South Korea. 
  Other major projects include the development of the far 
eastern port of Nakhodka and the construction of a trade center 
in Moscow. 
  "It is important for us that the president of South Korea 
treats with understanding the issue of postponing debt 
payments," Yeltsin said, and added, "Russia has sufficient 
grounds for an optimistic assessment of the prospects for 
bilateral relations with South Korea." 
  The Russian leader stressed, "we have on many occasions 
stated that we are interested in full-blooded economic relations 
and would like to see a growth in South Korean investment in our 
economy, especially in the Far East." 
  He also expressed the belief that South Korean companies 
could help convert Russian defense enterprises to civilian 
production and noted that "considerable understanding" had been 
reached on issues concerning cooperation during the current 
Russo-South Korean summit meeting. 
  At the news conference, Yeltsin made it clear that Moscow 
would not pay compensation to relatives of the victims of the 
KAL-007 boeing downed by the Soviet Air Force in the Far East in 
1983, as the crew of the South Korean airliner was to blame for 
its intrusion into Soviet airspace. 
  He stressed that the tragedy occurred during "Cold War" 
times 
and was triggered by "a combination of a number of 
circumstances."
