  [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and his visiting South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam 
expressed their willingness on Thursday [2 June] evening to 
expand bilateral cooperation, particularly in the economic 
sphere. 
  Speaking at the state diner in honor of Kim Yong-sam in the 
Kremlin, the Russian president said "ties between the two 
countries are developing effectively at present." 
  But it is necessary to "move ahead" and give "the green 
light" to all cooperative projects in all spheres of live, 
Yeltsin pointed out. 
  He added that this applies first of all to the economic 
field, particularly since the two countries have opportunities 
and reserves for this. 
  Russia wants to see Korea reunified in a peaceful, 
democratic 
way as soon as possible, Yeltsin said, expressing hope that a 
"united" Korea becomes "a reliable partner of Russia." 
  According to him, relations with Seoul is "one of Moscow's 
most important priorities in the Asian-Pacific direction." 
  One of the high priority tasks is to guarantee the 
non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula, the Russian leader 
stated. He recalled that Russia was the first to propose 
convening an international conference on the issue. 
  "The conference would seek a comprehensive solution to the 
nuclear problem as well as specific accords aimed at lessening 
and eventually eliminating the dangerous confrontation on the 
Korean peninsula," Yeltsin noted. 
  Kim Yong-sam said, in turn, that he is quite convinced that 
"a very bright future lies ahead of us" in Russian-South Korean 
relations. 
  "We will surely share a great future together if the 
advanced 
technology and vast natural resources of the Russian Federation 
are combined with the industrial development and business 
management expertise of (South) Korea," he said. 
  He said documents concerning the Korean war of 1950-1953, 
which were handed earlier on Thursday to the South Korean 
president by Yeltsin, "will stand as a symbol of our firm 
determination to make a fresh start in our relations, putting 
behind us our unfortunate past relations during the era of Cold 
War." 
  Kim Yong-sam arrived in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon for a 
four- day official visit to Russia. On Thursday morning he 
signed with Yeltsin a joint Russian-South Korean declaration at 
the close of their summit talks in the Kremlin.

  [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam said here on Thursday [2 June] that South Korea and 
Russia could be "trusted partners." 
  Addressing the Federation Council (the upper house of the 
Russian parliament), the South Korean leader also stressed that 
"It will be impossible to preserve peace in northeast Asia 
without Russian cooperation." 
  Kim Yong-sam arrived in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon for a 
four-day official visit to Russia. On Thursday morning, he 
signed a joint Russian-South Korean declaration together with 
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin during their summit talks. 
  He told Russian lawmakers that through an "extensive 
dialogue" with Yeltsin this morning he was convinced that South 
Korea and Russia could be "trusted partners in quest of greater 
shared prosperity well into the 21th century." 
  The South Korean leader said both the two states should 
cooperate to ensure the success of the reform policies now being 
pursued in both lands. 
  He expressed the hope that his current visit will boost 
Russian-South Korean cooperation that "will make us even better 
neighbors." 
  The countries' two-way trade jumped from only 900 million 
U.S. dollars in 1990 to 1.6 billion last year, Kim Yong-sam 
said, adding that South Korean businesses have invested 24 
million U.S. dollars in 25 development projects in Russia, and 
as of March 1994, 29 major South Korean companies had 
established branch offices in the country. 
  Kim Yong-sam appealed to the Russian lawmakers to actively 
cooperate in seeking an early solution to the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian peacekeeping 
forces will enter the Abkhaz region on June 3-5 as a buffer to 
the conflict there between Georgia and the Autonomous Republic 
of Abkhazia, the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev told 
INTERFAX today that the warring parties both expressed 
understanding of the move and have no major differences with 
Moscow over this issue. 
  Abhkazia proclaimed its independence on July 23, 1992, a 
step 
which was rejected by Georgia. Armed conflict between the two 
sides began after Tbilisi sent troops to Abhkazia on August 14, 
1992. 
  Under an accord signed in Moscow on May 14, the rival 
parties 
agreed to be separated in the disputed region and allow the 
Commonwealth of Independent states (CIS) to deploy troops in the 
agreed upon security zone. 
  According to the deputy defense minister, the separation 
will 
be achieved in three stages -- 1,500 Russian soldiers will enter 
the region in the first stage, followed by the deployment of a 
of 3,000 CIS troops. 
  CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya said during his 
visit to Azerbaijan that Russian President Boris Yeltsin is 
expected to issue the order to send the peacekeeping troops to 
Abkhazia on Friday.

  [Text] Rome, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Italian President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro and newly elected Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi held talks with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton 
today on a number of bilateral and international issues. 
  Clinton arrived here Thursday [2 June] to start his 
week-long 
visit to Europe, which takes in France and Britain, linked to 
the commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the 
D-Day landings in Europe during the Second World War. 
  In the talks, the leaders exchanged views on bilateral 
relations and ways of reducing mass unemployment. They also 
examined the preparations for the summit of the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations to be held in Italy next month. 
  Clinton praised Italy for its support for the operation of 
the Forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 
Bosnia. 
  Referring to the proposed increase of permanent seats in the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton told Berlusconi that the United 
States supported the efforts by Japan and Germany to seek a 
permanent seat each in the Council. He also said that he would 
not rule out the idea of extending membership to more countries. 
  Between the meeting with Scalfaro and talks with Berlusconi, 
Clinton went to the Vatican and met Pope John Paul. 
  Clinton acknowledged at the news conference that there were 
"genuine differences" with the pope on abortion and 
contraception, which the Catholic Church forbids. 
  The main theme of the talks, according to Vatican sources, 
was the procedure for a U.N. population conference due to be 
held in Cairo in September. 
  The Vatican fears the conference, which is drawing up a 
20-year-plan to stabilize world population, will back abortion 
and contraception.

  [Text] Bogota, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Colombia notified the 
U.S. Government that it will not revoke its decision to 
intercept and shoot down any plane that has been declared 
suspicious or hostile even if the Pentagon decides definitively 
it will no longer supply information on unauthorized flights. 
  The "EL TIEMPO" newspaper revealed today that Colombia's 
Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and Air Force Commander 
Major General Alfonso Abondano Alzamora spoke out publicly and 
forcefully to that respect. 
  The minister and commander were in response to the U.S. 
Government's official information on Tuesday [31 May] that the 
suspension of U.S. radar operations in Colombia and Peru was due 
to the fact that the U.S. Defense Department is in disagreement 
with Colombia's decision and practices in Peru. 
  Pardo Rueda affirmed that the Colombian Government is not 
going to suspend its order to Colombia's Air Force to intercept 
planes without registration numbers, request their flight plan 
and force them to land if the pilots of those aircraft do not 
supply the same or shoot them down if they refuse to comply with 
orders. 
  He said that the measure is a valuable tool which Colombia 
is 
using to prevent drug traffickers and other criminals from 
violating Colombian air space. 
  Colombia's Air Force commander lodged a protest over the 
unilateral suspension of radar operations and said that the U.S. 
decision was taken without consultation. 
  It was reported that the U.S. Government is studying the 
re-establishment of radar services and information for 
controlling drug trafficking in Colombia and Peru.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yang Guojun (2799 0948 6874)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong Yiren 
met with John Chalsty, president of the Donaldson, Lufkin, and 
Jenrette Securities Corporation, and his party in the Great Hall 
of the People today. He expressed the hope that more business 
people from U.S. securities circles will become involved in 
China's infrastructure construction and invest in more sectors. 
  Rong Yiren said: The Chinese and U.S. economies are mutually 
complementary to a great extent. China has a huge market, and 
its investment environment is improving. From both the present 
and long-term points of view, the prospects for trade and 
cooperation in the economy and technology between the two 
countries is promising. 
  Rong Yiren expressed his belief that President Clinton was 
wise to recently declare the extension of China's MFN 
[most-favored nation] status and the termination of linking the 
MFN issue to human rights, saying that this decision is in line 
with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is 
beneficial to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving and 
developing the two countries' relations. Rong Yiren expressed 
his thanks for the work that the Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette 
Securities Corporation had done in extending China's MFN status. 
  Briefing the visitors on the situation of China's reform and 
opening up in the last decade and more, Rong Yiren said: During 
the course of accelerating the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure this year, the measures that China has 
adopted in reforming finance, taxes, planning, investment, and 
foreign trade are going smoothly. The state's revenues have 
increased, and the currency exchange rate is stable. Although 
prices have risen, the government has taken effective measures 
to control prices. Rong Yiren pointed out: We are very prudent 
in the implementation of various concrete reform measures, and 
prudence is conducive to bringing about an even more coordinated 
type of economic development. He said: The current work of the 
government remains to focus on handling well the relations 
between reform, development, and stability. 
  Chalsty said that because of his firm's extremely great 
interest in the Chinese market, they held successful talks with 
the State Planning Commission and other relevant Chinese 
departments on strengthening Sino-U.S. cooperation in various 
fields. 
  To our knowledge, the Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette 
Securities Corporation is one of the powerful securities and 
investment firms in the United States. The current visit is 
mainly for the purpose of seeking the opportunity of promoting 
or expanding cooperation in the power, chemical, 
telecommunications, iron and steel, aviation, and automobile 
industries.

  [Text] Washington, June 1 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has pledged to keep more contacts, more business and 
more international cooperation with China. 
  "We must see our relations with China within the broader 
context of our interests in the Asian Pacific region, of which 
America is an integral part," he said in an article entitled 
"Isolating China Wouldn't Improve Human Rights" which was 
published on Tuesday's [31 May] "LOS ANGELES TIMES." 
  Justifying his decision to extend the most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status to China, Clinton said, "The actions I have 
taken on China are in the long-term interests of both the United 
States and China." 
  "Linking human rights to MFN has taken us as far as it can," 
he added. 
  He also noted that "after ten years of argument and veto, we 
no longer had two China policies -- one from the Congress and 
one from the President -- but a single American policy." 
  On future ties with Beijing, the U.S. President said, "We 
will have more contacts, more trade, more international 
cooperation and more intense and constant dialogue on human 
rights issues." 
  Clinton also praised China's fast developed economy, saying 
that a 21st-century economy is taking shape in China, which was 
the world's fastest growing economy last year. 
  China is not only a big market for America-produced goods, 
but also a source of more jobs for American people, he added. 
  China has a veto in the United Nations Security Council and 
it is a major factor in Asian and global security, he said in 
the article, adding that the U.S. and China share important 
interests in some fields.

Clinton formally notified the congress Thursday [2 June] of his

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
meeting with John Chalsty, president of the U.S. Donaldson, 
Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corporation, voiced the hope here 
today that the business and financial circles of the two 
countries will enhance cooperation. 
  The premier told the U.S. visitors that Sino-U.S. relations 
have maintained the momentum for improvement, which is the 
common aspiration of the two peoples and falls in line with the 
interests of the two nations. 
  During the meeting, Li briefed them on the country's 
priorities of development. He expressed the wish that more U.S. 
businessmen will come and explore means for cooperating with 
their Chinese partners. 
  Noting the frequent visits to China by executives of U.S. 
securities companies, Li said this has shown their keen interest 
in China's market. All are welcome and will be ensured equal 
treatment, he added. 
  Chalsty said his corporation is very pleased with the U.S. 
extension of China's most-favored-nation trading status. 
  He said that as two great nations, the U.S. and China should 
treat each other equally and strengthen cooperation. This is 
beneficial to both sides. 
  Chalsty and his party are here to learn about the 
development 
of China's industries, such as those producing electricity, 
chemicals, iron and steel and automobiles, and its policies 
concerning the use of foreign capital, with the end of exploring 
cooperative possibilities, sources here said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 3 (YONHAP) -- China will stop 
supplying food and oil to North Korea as well as halt border 
trade if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions on 
Pyongyang, a Chinese-language newspaper published here reported 
Friday. 
  The report by TA KUNG PAO, which is supported financially by 
Beijing, attracted keen attention since it is the first detailed 
mentioning by a daily widely reputed to be a "virtual Chinese 
official paper" of China's possible joining in U.N. sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
  In a six-column article titled "Situation on Korean 
Peninsula 
Becomes Tense Again," the newspaper said, "If the United Nations 
decides to impose economic sanctions, China will stop supplying 
food and oil to North Korea together with border trade involving 
all other commodity goods." 
  The newspaper pointed out that, upon a U.N. decision in 
favor of economic sanctions, the United States will undertake a 
naval blockade of North Korea while Tokyo stops remittances by 
pro-communist Koreans in Japan. "North Korea cannot cope with 
such extensive economic sanctions by China, America and Japan," 
warned the newspaper. 
  Urging North Korea to accept outside nuclear inspection, the 
paper said this would help clear up international suspicions 
over Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions and improve North Korea's 
relations with South Korea, the United States and Japan. 
  North Korea's devastated economy cannot bear any massive war 
expenses, the paper explained. Should it become engaged in war, 
its domestic economy would worsen and therefore it should 
refrain from provoking South Korea. 
  Should war break out on the Korean peninsula, Russia would 
not support North Korea as the Pyongyang-Moscow friendship 
treaty is to be scrapped in two years, the paper said. South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is currently visiting Russia, 
had a series of discussion on the nuclear issue when he met with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, it noted. 
  However, TA KUNG PAO urged South Korea, the United States 
and 
Japan to negotiate with Pyongyang and hold off on the 
much-talked-about threat of sanctions. 
  A Hong kong-based expert on China said the newspaper's 
report 
deserves special attention in that it appeared at a time when 
U.N. sanctions against North Korea are imminent. 
  The newspaper previously reported that China was persuading 
North Korea to solve the nuclear problem.

in a friendly atmosphere. 
  Koji Kakizawa expressed satisfaction with the smooth 
development of Japanese-Chinese relations. He held that both 
sides should strive to build full-blown cooperative relations 
that are geared to the future and that will make a contribution 
to world peace. Tang Jiaxuan agreed. 
  Referring to the incident in which some people in Japan 
recently made remarks negating Japan's history of aggression, 
Kakizawa said Prime Minister Hata and he too have made known 
their positions and adopted measures in this connection. He 
said: The Japanese Government would like to reiterate that it 
will continue to work hard for the development of Sino-Japanese

consultations between the foreign ministries of the two 
countries. On 1 June, Tang and his Japanese counterpart, 
Hiroshi Fukuda, exchanged views in a friendly, frank, and 
deep-going way on Sino-Japanese relations and on international 
issues of common interest. They achieved consensus on a wide 
range of issues. 
  Tang Jiaxuan also met with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general 
of 
LDP; Kubo Wataru, secretary general of the Japan Socialist 
Party; Ichikawa Yuichi, secretary general of Komeito; and

  [Text] Tokyo, June 2 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese trade minister 
today urged Japan to implement as early as possible its planned 
fourth package of yen loans to China through official 
development assistance, so as to help China with its shift to a 
market economy. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, made the request during a 15-minute meeting with 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutoma Hata in the Japanese Diet 
(parliament) building, a Chinese trade official said. 
  The official quoted Wu as saying that yen loans had played a 
vital role in developing the Chinese economy and in boosting 
Japanese investment in China since 1979, when Japan began to 
implement its first package of loans to China. 
  Hata, who met Wu last November in Seattle, said that Japan 
should try to develop long-term relations with China based on 
repentance for its wartime invasion of its neighbor, 
  He mentioned former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's 
remarks 
about the war that have been roundly condemned by Japan's Asian 
neighbors. 
  Nagano resigned in early May after saying that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an 
aggressor during World War II. 
  The prime minister also hailed the "rapid increase" in 
bilateral trade, the volume of which reached some 39 billion 
U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 54 percent over 1992. 
  Wu, who arrived here on Tuesday [31 May], is on a week-long 
visit to Japan at the invitation of the minister of 
international trade and industry. She is also leading a 
ten-member delegation to the regular conference on investment 
between China and Japan.

  [Text] Valletta, Malta, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Maltese Prime 
Minister Edward Fenech Adami said that he will seek an approach 
to even better Maltese-Chinese relations during his upcoming 
visit to China on June 6-11. 
  In an interview with XINHUA NEWS AGENCY on the eve of his 
visit, the prime minister also recalled his first visit to China 
in 1978. "Even when I came to China as an opposition leader, I 
realized the importance of promoting our bilateral relations." 
  The coming visit will give him the opportunity to exchange 
views on bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Chinese 
leaders, Adami added. 
  The Prime Minister pointed out that great potential exists 
for the two countries to further strengthen their economic 
cooperation. 
  Commenting on Malta's domestic economic policy, Adami said 
the national economic structure is undergoing readjustment and 
transformation, and that government efforts to encourage private 
enterprise and liberal trade have produced fine results. 
  Despite wide-spread recession in Western Europe, the Maltese 
economy has performed relatively well, with a low unemployment 
rate of four percent and steady development in tourism and the 
electronics industry, the prime minister said. 
  At the moment, Malta is seeking European Union membership 
which, he underlined, will have great political and economic 
significance for his country. 
  On the Mediterranean situation, the Maltese official 
suggested that the Mediterranean nations should strengthen their 
ties and set up a permanent organization to facilitate 
cooperation and dialogue. 
  He also acknowledged some potentially dangerous situations 
in 
the region and warned against those negative factors that could 
degenerate into conflict. 
  Adami hailed the peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue 
as very positive, and expressed the hope that the 
Palestinian-Israeli accord will produce good results.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that China is willing to contribute to the early 
realization of peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia with 
the joint efforts of the international community. 
  Li made the remarks in a meeting here this afternoon with 
Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Lojze Peterle and his party. 
  The premier noted that conflicts in that region are one of 
the negative effects left by the Cold War. After the Cold War, 
the world has not become as peaceful as some people have 
imagined. 
  The fact is that the world has witnessed a rise of 
destabilizing factors, such as national disputes, regional 
conflicts and economic discrepancy. This has been shown all too 
clearly in the former Yugoslavian region, Li said. 
  China is concerned about the evolution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina situation, he added. 
  China holds that international conflicts should be settled 
through peaceful means and that the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of each country involved be respected, and the rights 
and interests of its minorities be protected, he said. 
  Though far away from Europe, China sincerely hopes that 
Europe attains peace and stability, Li said. 
  Peterle expressed his appreciation for this stance of the 
Chinese side, adding that Slovenia also hopes for a just and 
fair solution to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. 
  During the meeting, Li extended a welcome to Peterle on his 
first visit to China. 
  Li also recalled his meeting with Slovenian Prime Minister 
J. 
Drnovsek while attending the world environment and development 
conference in 1992. He asked Peterle to convey his best wishes 
to his Slovenian counterpart. 
  The Chinese premier invited Drnovsek to visit China within 
the year. Peterle said that Drnovsek is looking forward to that 
visit. 
  Peterle told Li that he was pleased to be here and his talks 
with Chinese officials have been satisfactory. 
  He voiced the belief that the bilateral relations will be 
enhanced in the future. 
  Later in the afternoon, Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the 
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, 
met with Peterle and his party.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--Beijing University professor 
Ding Zilin has launched a two-day hunger strike in protest at 
heavy police surveillance of her home, ahead of the fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre, a source said Friday. 
  A tearful Ding, whose son Jiang Jielian was shot by soldiers 
on June 3, 1989, said she and her husband Jiang Peikun had only 
drunk water since after dinner Thursday, according to a reporter 
who succeeded in telephoning the protesters Friday despite 
official efforts to isolate them. 
  Jiang Peikun, also a professor, said this week that if 
police 
officers outside their home had not left by Thursday the couple 
would begin their protest at 6:25 p.m. (1025 GMT) and continue 
until Saturday, the anniverary of the army's crushing of 
pro-democracy demonstraters on June 4, 1989. 
  The hunger strike's starting time marks the moment of the 
birth of Jiang Jielan, who celebrated his 17th birthday one day 
before being killed. 
  The couple lit candles on a birthday cake Thursday to mark 
what would have been his 22nd birthday. 
  "My son was shot between 11:05 and 11:15 pm on June 3," 
Ding, 
a 57-year-old philosophy professor who suffers from heart 
problems, told this reporter. "I don't know when he actually 
stopped breathing. I will continue to fast till June 4 because 
I want to commemorate others who died with him," she said. 
  Ding said her heart had been bothering her Thursday night 
but 
insisted that she was now better and lying in bed very calmly. 
The reporter said however that Ding was crying and sounded weak 
and shaky. 
  The number of plainclothes police visible from her window 
had 
increased from about four to eight Thursday night, the professor 
said, confirming that the reporter was the only person to 
succeed in calling her in almost 24 hours. The authorities 
began blocking all incoming and outgoing calls to Ding's 
appartment around midday Thursday. "The police don't want 
people to know what I'm doing," she said. 
  Jiang said Thursday that police had followed him and his 
wife 
everywhere in recent days and harassed anybody who tried to 
visit them. 
  The couple sent an appeal to the Chinese Government last 
week 
to restore their freedom. 
  The houses of all dissidents and their families have been 
placed under heavy surveillance recently, as part of an intense 
security clampdown here in the run-up to the anniversary of the 
massacre.

<F P=106> [Article by Yueh Shan (1471 1472): "Reviewing the Causes of </F>
the `Turmoil,' Diehards Insist That the Massacre Was Correct"] 
  [Text] There are different opinions within the CPC on the 4 
June massacre. The diehards insist that the massacre was 
"reasonable." This finds full expression in their analysis of 
and conclusions on the causes of the 1989 "turmoil." 
  In mid-December 1993, a discussion meeting was held by the 
General Office of the CPC Central Committee to review and sum up 
the causes of the political "turmoil" in 1989. Also attending 
the meeting were such institutions as the Policy Research Office 
of the CPC Central Committee, the Policy Research Office of the 
State Council, the Policy Research Office of the Chinese Academy 
of Social Sciences, the International Relations Research 
Institute, and the Information Institute of the Ministry of 
Public Security. 
  The subjects discussed at the meeting included the main 
causes of the evolution of the "political turmoil" in 1989, the 
current unstable factors inside the country, and their 
relationship with external factors. The meeting also drew 
conclusions on the serious deviations of bureaucratism and 
rightism in the party's work. The material on the meeting, 
although a bit out of date, remains useful for reference. 
  When reviewing the main causes of the 1989 political 
turmoil, 
the meeting enumerated six points. 
  First, it was correct that the party focused its work on 
economic construction, but the party neglected the existence of 
the hostile forces in society, which continued to organize 
activities with the support of certain external forces from 1984. 
  Second, from the central to local levels, the party leaders 
neglected the existence of the ideological struggle between the 
right and the wrong; and for a certain period, neglected and 
even negated the existence of the ideological trend to oppose 
the "four cardinal principles" inside the party. 
  Third, a number of bureaucratic and corrupt elements inside 
the party and government leading organs violated and disrupted 
the party's established principles and policies, and thus harmed 
the relationship between the party and the masses. 
  Fourth, a considerable number of party organizations gave up 
political and ideological studies and did not properly 
consolidate themselves. After criticizing and correcting the 
previous ultraleftist line of putting politics in command, they 
slipped into the rightist deviation of regarding political and 
ideological work as useless. So they were bogged down in a 
helpless position and became panic-stricken when the turmoil 
occurred. 
  Fifth, some people inside the party neglected the fact of 
the 
U.S. hegemonists' nature and basic strategy of subverting, 
infiltrating, and interfering in socialist China; and they even 
neglected the fact that the United States had never stopped its 
ideological infiltration aimed at effecting peaceful evolution 
in China. 
  Sixth, some party leaders tried to split the party, and they 
used the turmoil and the party's lack of preparation against the 
turmoil to divert people's attention from the serious mistakes 
in their work and style. They even did not scruple to split the 
party and support the turmoil. 
  Only the third of the above-mentioned six points is somewhat 
pertinent. This showed that the diehards inside the CPC did not 
have any guilty conscience for the social unrest in 1989 and the 
4 June massacre; on the contrary, they just put the blame on the 
so-called "hostile forces," "hegemonists," and "splittists" 
(referring to Zhao Ziyang). How ridiculous this is! 
  They also summed up four external factors: 
  First, the hostile elements inside and outside the country 
and inside and outside the party made use of the problems in the 
implementation of the party's line in the realm of 
superstructure and the rightist deviation of the party 
leadership to create public opinion against the party's 
leadership and against socialism. 
  Second, the hegemonist forces and power politics represented 
by the United States used the opportunity of China's 
concentrating on economic construction to instigate, abet, and 
support domestic hostile forces to stir up trouble and create 
turmoil in order to overthrow the current socialist system, to 
oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and to make China 
follow the system of the United States. 
  Third, the Western mass media continued their habitual 
practice of cooking up rumors and creating sensational events in 
their anti-China and anticommunist propaganda so that they 
played a role in adding fuel to the flames and aggravating the 
seriousness of the events. 
  Fourth, hostile elements in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas 
areas took advantage of the turmoil to create sensational news, 
thus instigating people who were not aware of the true facts to 
donate money in order to achieve their anti-China and 
anticommunist purpose and to aggravate the turmoil in China. 
  The so-called "external factors" were also based on the 
stereotypical "class analysis" method and "class struggle" 
theory. They did not mention the actual and important external 
factor. That is, in the contemporary world, democracy has 
become a historical trend, and the autocratic system is at its 
last gasp. Why did the CPC authorities not dare to face this 
reality squarely? 
  The meeting pointed out the unstable factors and the 
possibilities inside China: 
  First, the rightist deviation still existed in the thinking 
and routine work of some party organizations in terms of being 
alert to the activities of hostile forces and their destructive 
effects. 
  Second, the bureaucratic style of work of some party and 
government institutions produced very bad effects among the 
masses, and the relationship between the party and the masses 
had yet to be further improved by initiatives taken by the party. 
  Third, although corruption and abuse of power among party 
and 
government cadres were rectified to a certain degree, the state 
of affairs was not improved to the degree of winning trust and 
support from the masses. 
  Fourth, the price hikes aroused discontent among cadres and 
the masses, who hoped to improve their living conditions. 
  Fifth, there were difficulties in the implementation of the 
rural and agricultural policies; and local leaders had certain 
wrong ideas about the rural work and the issues concerning the 
peasants. This led to certain problems in the rural work. 
  Sixth, the exodus of the rural population and the increasing 
jobless population in society added pressure to society as a 
whole and caused problems in law and order. 
  Seventh, although the hostile forces in society did not act 
as flagrantly as before, they were still carrying out seditious 
activities by making use of the errors of local party 
organizations and local governments in the implementation of the 
policies and in their routine work. 
  Eighth, the local party and government institutions did not 
correctly understand and effectively carry out the policies and 
principles laid down by the central authorities; some local 
leaders made mistakes in the course of carrying out the policies 
and produced negative effects among the masses. 
  It seemed that the discussion meeting came to recognize some 
problems in reality only in the last part of its agenda, but it 
still adopted some improper and extremely erroneous approaches, 
such as criticizing the "rightist deviation." The criticism of 
the "rightist deviation" just showed the leftist deviation of 
the meeting's participants. The conclusions of the meeting 
were, on the whole, the product of leftism, and were used as the 
"ideological grounds" for further suppressing the pro-democracy 
movement.

<F P=106> ["Notes on a Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping </F>
(5012 0393): "CPC Discovers Prodemocracy Movement Undercurrent 
With Alarm"] 
  [Text] Five years have passed since the outbreak of the 
prodemocracy movement in 1989. Will another high tide appear 
after the ebb? 
  There are various signs that aftershocks have continued 
after 
the initial quake. 
  Certain shocks have come from the masses' demands for 
democracy, and some have come from the people's disenchantment 
with their current living conditions. Some shocks have come 
from the popular indignation aroused by the worsening corruption 
of officialdom. All this has represented a crisis, a serious 
crisis, for the Jiang-Li regime. 
  The crisis is similar to that of five years ago, and is more 
complicated and of greater shock potential. We may note the 
following facts: 
  --Waves of labor unrest have arisen one after another in all 
parts of the country and have swept across 19 cities. In Inner 
Mongolia, thousands of party and government cadres in the 
institutions of the autonomous region were also involved in a 
"disturbance." 
  --The authorities discovered "organized illegal hostile 
activities of underground sedition, collaboration, and 
subversion against the current social system and the People's 
Government" in 33 cities of 17 provinces. 
  --The CPC authorities intensified merciless crackdowns by 
arresting and jailing political prisoners and prisoners of 
conscience. At present, more than 1,700 
"counterrevolutionaries" are in jail. This may be an incomplete 
figure. 
  All this shows that sparks of the prodemocracy movement are 
still spreading, and the CPC authorities are upset by the hidden 
dangers everywhere. 
  Recently, the CPC leaders openly called for employing the 
method used in handling the 4 June incident against the 
prodemocracy movement, and this more directly shows that the 
prodemocracy movement is threatening the Jiang-Li regime and 
that the CPC leaders are on tenterhooks. 
  On 10 May, Jiang Zemin spoke at an enlarged meeting of the 
CPC Central Political Bureau, and the speech laid bare both his 
fears and his merciless nature. 
  Jiang said: The resolute action taken by the central 
leadership against the political turmoil in spring and summer of 
1989 was completely correct. If things had not been handled in 
that way, China would have been thrown into chaos, and external 
political forces would have taken advantage of the opportunity 
to make more extensive inroads into China to subvert the 
government. We would then have had to pay even greater costs. 
Comrade Xiaoping recently said that, if it had not been for 
Zhao Ziyang's double-dealing within the party, the incident 
would have been settled much sooner. In the future, if similar 
events of turmoil occur, we must take resolute and timely 
actions without any delay. 
  Jiang added: Facts over the past five years have educated 
and enlightened our people and cadres and have made them aware 
that a very small number of hostile elements at home are always 
trying to stir up trouble and overthrow the socialist system, 
that the hegemonists in the world are also always trying to 
interfere in China's internal affairs, and that the hostile 
political forces outside the mainland and in overseas areas are 
always trying to join hands with the domestic hostile elements 
in carrying out subversive activities. We have no other option 
but to adopt resolute measures against the undermining and 
subversive activities of the hostile forces. 
  Jiang Zemin did not express even a bit of repentance for the 
inhumane massacre of five years ago; instead, he even stressed 
the rationality and necessity of using tanks and troops to kill 
the innocent people who were peacefully demanding democracy. 
This utterly exposes the antipeople nature of the Jiang-Li 
regime and also reflects their fear when facing the prodemocracy 
undercurrent among the people. 
  An informed analyst has said: The CPC authorities long ago 
laid down the verdict on the 4 June incident, and Deng Xiaoping 
has long ordered other people not to mention the incident any 
longer so that it might be buried in history. However, the 
first topic discussed at the Political Bureau meeting on 10 May 
was the 4 June incident. Jiang Zemin brought up this matter from 
the past. This showed that Deng Xiaoping may not have been in 
good health recently, and some people within the CPC have tried 
to take this opportunity to reverse the verdict on the incident. 
Jiang's speech was aimed at warning them against reserving the 
verdict. 
  The analyst's conclusions are worth considering. 
  Many people pay close attention to the attitude expressed by 
the military in China. According to information from internal 
channels, Zhang Wannian, member of the CPC Central Military 
Commission and chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces, 
has been singing the same tune as Jiang Zemin. At a recent 
national meeting of the party committee leaders of the armed 
police forces, Zhang Wannian said that, under the current 
international and domestic circumstances, the People's 
Liberation Army should fulfill "four sacred duties." One of the 
"four sacred duties" is related to suppressing the prodemocracy 
movement. 
  "We should, according to the party's calls and orders, 
mercilessly crack down on and smash the organized and 
premeditated activities of the hostile forces against the party 
central leadership, the People's Government, the Constitution, 
and the current socialist system. We should crack down on and 
smash undermining and subversive activities and events of 
turmoil and rebellions created by the hostile elements attached 
to the external anti-China and anticommunist forces." 
  According to the CPC authorities' slanderous remarks against 
the prodemocracy movement in 1989, it was clear that the fourth 
task of "merciless crackdown and smashing" was aimed at the 
prodemocracy movement and the demonstrating masses who called 
for eliminating corruption and effecting democracy. In fact, 
the terms "turmoil" and "rebellion" have long been used by the 
CPC authorities to describe peaceful prodemocracy movements like 
that in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The "merciless crackdown and 
smashing" obviously referred to the use of force in suppressing 
such prodemocracy movements. 
  The remarks later uttered by Zhang Wannian explicitly 
expressed this idea. He said: China's development and the 
drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 
have shown that the actions and measures taken by the central 
authorities against the political turmoil in 1989 were 
completely correct and necessary, because the turmoil was 
supported by some foreign political forces and was aimed at 
overthrowing socialist China led by the Communist Party. The 
economic sanctions imposed by the hegemonists and their 
followers failed to daunt the CPC, the Chinese Government, and 
the Chinese people and failed to stop China's continuing 
development and growth; on the contrary, this practice only laid 
bare the fact that the hegemonists had not changed their basic 
strategy against China and that the hostile political forces had 
never stopped their sinister anti-China and anticommunist 
activities of subversion, infiltration, and sabotage. The 
hostile elements will never change their nature and will never 
stop their undermining and disruptive activities of creating 
turmoil and rebellions. 
  Such remarks uttered by Zhang Wannian explicitly indicated 
that the CPC authorities would continue to use the methods of 
the 4 June massacre to suppress prodemocracy movements. 
  At the national meeting of party committees in the armed 
police force, Tao Siju, first political commissar of the armed 
police force, also spoke. He repeated the main points of Zhang 
Wannian's speech and made some additions. He said: Firm and 
timely crackdowns must be carried out on the organized and 
premeditated activities of the hostile forces aimed at 
subverting and overthrowing the leadership of the Communist 
Party and opposing the socialist system, and their plots and 
undermining activities must be smashed. The undermining 
activities of the hostile forces supported and abetted by the 
external anti-China and anticommunist political forces must be 
firmly and ruthlessly exposed, sternly counterattacked, and 
thoroughly smashed. This is a basic principle of the party and 
the state. The turmoil in the summer of 1989 was turned into a 
rebellion against the Communist Party, the socialist system, and 
the people's democratic dictatorship, and we took the necessary 
measures. Only thus could we achieve today's stable political 
situation. However, we must soberly note that the hostile 
forces at home and abroad, including a small handful of 
ultra-rightists in Hong Kong who have attached themselves to 
foreign powers and oppose everything China adopts, will never be 
willing to give in. They will inevitably use every opportunity 
to carry out activities of subversion, infiltration, and 
sabotage. We must resolutely crack down on their undermining 
activities against China, against the Communist Party, and 
against the socialist system without any lenience. 
  The party committees in the armed police force, the public 
security organs, and the judicial organs rapidly relayed the 
speeches by Zhang Wannian and Tao Siju and arranged study 
sessions. The armed police units and public security departments 
in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities sent 
telegrams one after another to the State Council, the Ministry 
of Public Security, and the Headquarters of the Armed Police 
Force to express their firm support. 
  It seems that the CPC authorities will not hesitate to 
repeat 
the tragedy in order to maintain their one-party dictatorship. 
This does not show that they are strong; on the contrary, this 
only shows their weakness and demonstrates that the Jiang-Li 
regime is being upset by the incessant crises. 
  However, I was also told by other sources that some people 
among the CPC high-ranking officials are opposed to methods of 
suppression like those used in the 4 June massacre. They 
maintain that, if more student unrest like the 4 June incident 
occurs, and if the students only stage peaceful demonstrations, 
then peaceful political methods should be used to settle the 
trouble and violence must be prevented. 
  I asked: "Would this be the mainstream opinion within the 
party?" 
  "I hope so. However, it seems that Jiang, Li, and other 
diehards will insist on the option of relying on military force."

"Deng Xiaoping's Health Condition and the CPC's Political 
Situation"] 
  [Text] In early April, the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau adopted a decision on setting up a leading 
group under the CPC Central Committee to attend to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's health. This decision was classified as top secret. 
Deng Xiaoping himself prefers his health condition to be 
promptly announced, lest his death one day should turn out to be 
an event causing "turbulence" in the community. 
<H5>  Never Have CHENG MING or TUNG HSIANG Filed Any Report </H5>
Stating Deng Is Dead 
  Reports on Deng Xiaoping's death have been filed from time 
to 
time, but never have CHENG MING and TUNG HSIANG filed any report 
of this kind. 
  This year's March issue of TUNG HSIANG carried a report 
saying that Deng Xiaoping intended to change the past practice 
whereby information about central leaders' health and serious 
illness should be kept absolutely secret. During a meeting on 
24 February, Wan Li told more than 80 veteran party, government, 
and Army leading cadres who had retired or retreated to the 
second line: The central authorities have accepted a suggestion 
made by Comrade Xiaoping, that is, information about Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's health condition should be accurately and 
promptly passed on to leaders of the party Central Committee, 
the State Council, the National People's Congress [NPC], the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], the 
Army, and localities, and this information can also be 
faithfully passed on to friendly countries and friends who are 
concerned about his health. Once there is any change in Comrade 
Xiaoping's health condition, the central authorities and the 
department concerned will promptly inform the public of it. 
  But, when should information about CPC leaders' health be 
publicized? 
<H5>  A Leading Group and Medical Care Group Attend To Deng </H5>
Xiaoping's Health 
  In early April, during its seventh work meeting, the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau adopted a decision on setting 
up a "leading group under the CPC Central Committee to attend to 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health." The group comprises Jiang 
Zemin as its head, Qiao Shi and Liu Huaqing as deputy heads, Wan 
Li and Qin Jiwei as advisers, and others as members, including 
Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Chi Haotian, Wang Ruilin, and Chen 
Minzhang. In addition, the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau also suggested that the central health care bureau be 
assigned to set up a group to attend to Deng Xiaoping's health 
care and medical service, comprising Ding Guangen as its head, 
Wang Ruilin and Chen Minzhang as deputy heads, and 24 medical 
personnel as group members who are to work in four shifts. Of 
the 24 medical personnel, 12 are experts in surgery, urology, 
and anaesthesiology, all with the title of department head or 
professor. They are from seven famous hospitals in Beijing and 
Shanghai, namely Concord Hospital, No. 301 Hospital, and Beijing 
Hospital in Beijing; and Guangci Hospital, Ruijin Hospital, 
Huadong Hospital, and the Second Military Medical University 
Hospital in Shanghai. 
  Apparently the CPC does not want to make public the decision 
on setting up that leading group under the CPC Central Committee 
to attend to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health. This decision was 
classified top secret, bearing the document number "Zheng 015." 
The document has been circulated only down to secretaries, 
deputy secretaries, and political commissars (for the military) 
of the party committees of all ministries, commissions, and 
offices; all provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities 
directly under the central government; and all arms and services 
and all major military regions. 
  If the information about Deng Xiaoping's health is to be 
released promptly as he suggested, then should this practice be 
introduced as soon as the above-mentioned two groups are 
established? If the above decision is not to be announced, then 
will any developments and changes in Deng's health in the future 
be kept top secret and not made public? 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin on Deng's Illness </H5>
  When attending a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee Standing Committee in early May, Jiang Zemin was asked 
by some standing committee members about Deng Xiaoping's health. 
Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Xiaoping's health condition is good. 
The doctor has advised him to undergo seasonal medical 
treatment with a view to regulating and promoting the 
metabolism, and not to move around too much. He is suffering 
from senile rheumatic arthritis of the arms and legs, and his 
blood pressure is a bit high sometimes. He needs to limit the 
time he spends on reading documents, newspapers, and watching 
television. 
  Deng Xiaoping's ailments as described by Jiang Zemin in 
early 
May are almost the same as those Wan Li spoke of on 24 February. 
Now that more than two months have passed, an informed source 
in Beijing doubts whether Deng's health condition could have 
remained unchanged throughout the period. If that were true, 
then why was it that a leading group and a medical service group 
were set up in early April to attend to Deng's health? 
  Deng Xiaoping Fears Great Chaos Will Occur in the 
Wake of His Death 
  The reason Deng Xiaoping wants his health condition to be 
promptly made known to the public, of course, is that he fears 
his death will throw China into "chaos." He knows some people 
in the outside world predict this. He wants to prevent his 
death from being a sudden event by enhancing the transparency of 
his own health condition so as not to cause social "chaos." 
  The news of Zhou Enlai's death was published suddenly. His 
death caused the 5 April turbulence of 1976. The news of Hu 
Yaobang's death was also published suddenly. It caused 
"turbulence" in the late spring and early summer of 1989. But 
the reason the deaths of these two leaders caused social 
"turbulence" was not that the news came so suddenly, but because 
of the great explosion of crises among the masses. On the 
former occasion, people took advantage of the activities 
mourning Zhou Enlai to vent their enmity and opposition to the 
"gang of five." Similarly, through activities mourning Hu 
Yaobang, people vented their dissatisfaction and anger at the 
conservative forces that had controlled Hu Yaobang and had 
ousted him from power. 
<H5>  A Power Struggle in the Imperial Court </H5>
  The deaths of dictators in totalitarian countries will 
surely 
lead to "imperial court coups" in struggles for power. Now 
Stalin had a stroke and fell from his bed, and his maidservant 
called Politburo members in, at which time Beria gave a curse, 
turned around, left him, and planned the next step of his plot. 
This plot was found in Khrushchev's memoirs and in Stalin's 
daughter's memoirs. Similarly, following Mao Zedong's death, 
the power struggle between Hua Guofeng, the legitimate 
successor, and the "gang of four," which had been left over from 
the "gang of five," also tended to be white-hot. If not, Hua 
Guofeng would not have agreed to dispose of the "gang of four!" 
At that time, Deng Xiaoping, who had then been removed from 
power, was also busy. He wrote two letters to Hua Guofeng, 
which was also what preceded the usurpation of power! 
  It is Deng Xiaoping's turn now. Obviously, the "Jiang-Li 
structure," which he has chosen and arranged, is the result of 
balancing the struggle among factions. Jiang Zemin is a 
character of the "middle elements." After Deng's death, he will 
be a partner in the "Jiang-Li structure" and Li's rival. 
Moreover, in addition to the "Jiang-Li structure," other 
contestants for supreme power are Deng Liqun of the conservative 
forces, Chen Yuan of the elders' children, Hua Guofeng, who 
stepped down, and Zhao Ziyang of the reform faction. Will they 
be able to cope with them? 
<H5>  Jiang Zemin Is Concerned About Danger From Outside </H5>
  Regarding China's post-Deng political situation, Jiang Zemin 
is now too much concerned about foreign influence. 
  On 4 May, Jiang Zemin called a meeting of the secretaries, 
governors, and people's congress chairmen of five provinces 
(Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian) and one 
municipality (Shanghai) in the auditorium of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee. At the meeting, Jiang Zemin said: 
  Hegemonism, overseas anti-Chinese and anticommunist 
political 
parties and political forces, and Taiwan's Li Teng-hui and the 
forces advocating Taiwan's independence all hope that turbulence 
and civil war will break out in China after Deng's death so that 
they can achieve their strategic goals. This is a dream of 
hegemonist and hostile forces. They lack a basic understanding 
of China's national conditions and political situation. 
  Jiang Zemin maintains that the danger in post-Deng China 
will 
mainly comes from abroad. His mistake is very grave. 
  He grew up under a communist culture and should know that it 
is not mainly external factors that contribute to something 
changing, but internal factors. He has the world in view, but 
does not see things around him. It was not imperialism or 
hegemonism that ousted Malenkov and Hua Guofeng from power. It 
will not be long before Deng Xiaoping falls critically ill and 
suddenly dies. The chain effect of this sudden incident will be 
a power struggle within the imperial court. This is almost 
inevitable and the destiny of communist countries. 
<H5>  Tian Jiyun: The Central Authorities Do Not Agree That Deng </H5>
Should Make Another Tour of Southern China 
  When speaking on Deng Xiaoping's health not long ago, Tian 
Jiyun said: Comrade Xiaoping appeared to be tired when he sent 
greetings to the people in Shanghai during the Spring Festival. 
There were many reasons. Prior to that, he had vacationed in 
Jiangsu. He caught a cold in Shanghai after standing on a 
bridge for nearly 20 minutes in a cold wind. Moreover, he is an 
old man about to turn 90. Comrade Xiaoping himself also said 
after reading foreign reports: "When a man is 70 years old, he 
gets weaker and weaker each year. This is a natural law. 
However, the foreign reports are exaggerated." 
  Tian Jiyun said: Comrade Xiaoping had planned to visit 
Guangdong and Hainan after this last Spring Festival. For 
health reasons, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee persuaded him not to do that. Moreover, his doctors 
do not agree that he should make a long trip. The general 
secretary, Comrade Wan Li, General Liu Huaqing, and Comrade Bo 
Yibo also joined in the persuasion. The elder Peng [Peng Zhen] 
also telephoned Comrade Xiaoping, asking him to take care of 
himself. 
  Tian Jiyun also said: Comrade Xiaoping has rested in other 
provinces recently. He has another plan for a trip to southern 
China. But the central authorities hope Comrade Xiaoping will 
listen to the doctors' advice. I think Comrade Xiaoping will 
listen.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Chinese police have detained six underground church 
activists in the run-up to tomorrow's fifth anniversary of the 
June 4 crackdown. They have also ordered hotels in Beijing to 
turn off the international television network CNN at least until 
next Monday. 
  Sources in the dissident community said yesterday that while 
they did not anticipate large-scale actions, protests by 
individual dissidents and workers could erupt this week. 
  Beijing resident Hua Huiqi said yesterday he and five other 
Christians had been taken into custody while they were 
worshipping together. Mr Hua said he was held from Monday to 
Wednesday. He said police returned to his flat yesterday to 
detain him again, but he was not home. 
  "This is a problem of belief, we haven't broken the law," he 
said in a telephone interview. 
  Mr Hua said Wang Huamin, Gao Feng, Wu Rengang, Xu Honghai 
and 
Gou Qinghui were detained last weekend. All but Gao, thought to 
be a 26-year-old car worker, are known to have been released, he 
said. 
  Mrs Gou is the wife of Xiao Biguang, a former Beijing 
University teacher and active Christian who was taken into 
custody on April 12. Mrs Gou was detained last Friday and 
interrogated for eight hours before being released after she 
started suffering heart problems, Mr Hua said. 
  Mr Xiao, 32, is a friend of Yuan Hongbing, a Beijing 
University law professor who was arrested in March. Yuan was a 
founder of the outlawed Federation for the Protection of 
Workers' Rights. 
  Police are believed to be hunting other affiliates of the 
federation, which organised a petition to the legislature 
calling for the freedom to form independent unions. 
  Sources in the dissident community said the authorities were 
concerned about the "political activism" of one branch of the 
underground church, which they suspected of having links with 
the nascent labour union movement. 
  It is understood that another group of Beijing-based church 
activists tried to start a demonstration earlier this year. 
  "The rally was aimed at demanding not only religious freedom 
but general political and civil rights," a source said. "It was 
stopped by police in time, and the organisers have been put 
under surveillance since then." 
  The dissident sources said that while police had banished 
Wang Dan and other big-name dissidents from the capital, 
individuals, including disgruntled workers, could stage protests 
in Beijing and other cities in the run-up to the anniversary. 
Security sources said that today and tomorrow parts of 
Tiananmen Square would be cordoned off from the public. 
  They said police were on guard against individuals or small 
groups staging protest actions, such as distributing 
pro-democracy leaflets and other literature calling for a 
reversal of the official verdict on the 1989 student movement. 
  Meanwhile hoteliers said major hotels in Beijing yesterday 
received a fax from the local Public Security Bureau asking them 
to switch off CNN, which is received by satellite. 
  "We were told by relevant authorities the cut-off is due to 
repairs to a hitch in the signal -- the service will be 
interrupted for up to a week," one hotel technician said. 
  CNN's suspension took effect just before the U.S.-based 
network aired a report on the growing potential for labour 
unrest in China. 
  Analysts said the ban on CNN was probably to keep file shots 
of the 1989 crackdown from being beamed into China during the 
anniversary period.

<F P=106> [Article by Chuan Hsun-che (0278 6061 5074): "Numbers of </F>
Political Prisoners Cited in a Document"] 
  [Text] How many "political prisoners" are still in jail in 
mainland China? This is always an enigma. International human 
rights organizations and Amnesty International have made 
painstaking efforts to discover the facts. The CPC authorities 
have never made public the relevant figures. 
  Between 7 and 9 April, at the national work conference 
attended by heads of the public security organs, the state 
security organs, the armed police units, and the judicial 
organs, the CPC authorities for the first time revealed the 
numbers of people charged with the counterrevolutionary crimes 
of subversion, sedition, and sabotage, or who were serving 
prison terms after being found guilty of such crimes, or who had 
been arrested and detained on suspicion of such crimes. 
According to the reports submitted by the local public security 
and judicial departments and the statistical materials (up to 
the end of March 1994), 1,730 people were serving prison terms 
after being found guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes. 
  At that time, 87 people had been arrested and were awaiting 
trial on charges of counterrevolutionary crimes. 
  More than 160 people were being detained for investigations. 
  Prisoners of this type released on bail or receiving medical 
treatment outside prison but still deprived of political rights 
numbered 135. 
  The following are the numbers of prisoners jailed in some 
localities: 
  Qinghai, more than 380. 
  Sichuan, 357. 
  Anhui, 82. 
  Guizhou, more than 100. 
  Liaoning, 66. 
  Xinjiang, 220. 
  Yunnan, more than 60. 
  Ningxia, 83. 
  Hunan, 37. 
  Hebei, 41. 
  Shaanxi, more than 60. 
  Beijing, 28. 
  Jiangxi, 46. 
  Tibet, more than 80. 
  The above figures are cited from the document (file number 
940028) issued by the Ministry of Justice on 6 April.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (CNS) -- Public security 
departments in China plan to strengthen administration over 
migrant people in cities through improvement of administration 
over urban residence registration and enactment of 
administrative methods on migrant labourers. 
  According to statistics, there are 80 million migrant 
population in the Mainland at present. As a result, numbers of 
various kinds of criminal cases are increasing at a rate of 6 
percent growth every year and big case numbers increasing at 18 
percent growth. Crimes committed by migrant people have taken a 
rather great ratio of the total criminal cases in number. 
Criminal cases committed by migrant people in Guangzhou and 
Shenzhen make up 80 percent of the total cases of the two cities 
in number, and in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin, such cases 
making up 50 percent of the total in number. Part of migrant 
people even engage in drug trafficking, drug taking, gambling 
and pornographic business, which have seriously harmed public 
security.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- China is to survey one 
percent of its total population to collect information on 
population quantity and distribution, housing, education, 
marriage, migration and composition. 
  Speaking at the first meeting of the population sample 
survey 
joint conference held here today, Chinese State Councillor Peng 
Peiyun said that the survey would provide a basis for forming 
long-term family-planning programs and information for the 
developing market economy. 
  The on-the-site survey will be carried out in October 1995, 
and the results are expected to be published in January 1996. 
  So far, China has conducted four national censuses and it 
took its fourth national census in 1990.

<F P=106> [XINHUA commentator's article: "It Is Necessary To </F>
Continuously Attach Importance to Family Planning Work"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- In recent years, China's 
birth rate has been steadily decreasing. Even in years when 
women of child-bearing age account for a high proportion of the 
total population, our country has held back the trend of a rapid 
increase in population. China has been recognized by the 
international community as one of the best countries in 
restraining the rapid growth of population. 
  However, we must soberly understand that we must not be too 
optimistic about the population situation in our country. 
First, the absolute growth of population in our country is 
still very high. The number of newborn babies each year is 
equivalent to the combined total of the population of Australia 
and New Zealand. Second, at present we are primarily relying on 
forceful administrative means to promote family planning work. 
The birth rate will rise again if we slacken our efforts 
slightly. Third, the situation of imbalance in family planning 
is still quite serious in various locales. In the next few 
years, China will continue to have some provinces and autonomous 
regions with women in their peak child-bearing years accounting 
for a large proportion of the total population. Owing to the 
fact that those provinces and autonomous regions are all located 
in northwest and southwest regions, the tasks of population 
control are ever more difficult. 
  Family planning concerns the vital interests of hundreds of 
millions of people, and so we must actively, prudently, and 
steadily grasp the work. While accelerating economic 
development, we must keep the population growth rate at a 
relatively low level. 
  Leading cadres at various levels must further heighten their 
understanding of the important, arduous, and prolonged nature of 
family planning work. The top leaders of party and government 
organizations at various levels must act according to the 
requirements set by the party central committee and the State 
Council, personally take charge of the work, and have all 
leading bodies understand the importance of the task and work 
with concerted efforts. We should further improve the 
responsibility system with merits linked to the goals of 
population control and family planning. We should pay attention 
to and strengthen the training of cadres for family planning 
work. We should organize various concerned departments to 
improve family planning work, and create a favorable social 
environment to promote late marriages and later childbirths, to 
advocate fewer childbirths and sound practice in bringing up 
children, and to treat boys and girls in the same way. 
  In implementing the policy of family planning in a constant 
manner, we must effectively strengthen family planning work at 
the grass-roots level. The rural areas are the main and 
difficult places in promoting family planning work. We must 
strengthen family planning work at the village level, mobilize 
the cadres of village party branches and villagers' committees, 
and truly implement family planning work down to all households 
and people. The cadres at the grass-roots level should learn 
from the family planning work in Shanxi's Wenshui County and the 
working spirit of Zhou Lanu. We should effectively grasp family 
planning work in all villages, towns, and households. Various 
locales should adopt different methods according to local 
conditions, and closely integrate the work of family planning 
with the work of developing the rural economy, of helping 
peasants get rich and become well-to-do, and of building 
civilized and happy families. 
  In implementing the policy of family planning in a constant 
manner, we must actively explore and establish a system which 
can suit the need of a socialist market economy and constantly 
solve new problems in the new situation of family planning work. 
In addition, we should strengthen the administration of family 
planning work for the migrating population. We should integrate 
the work of patient education and propaganda on family planning 
with enthusiastic and fine services, and integrate the work of 
family planning with the work of developing a socialist market 
economy and of building socialist spiritual civilization. We 
should strive to raise the quality of the population, improve 
the population structure, and promote a coordinated development 
of population, the economy, and society.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Teach Eaglets To Fly"] </F>
  [Text] Today is "1 June" International Children's Day, and 
to our young friends in the country we send our warm 
congratulations! We pay the highest tribute to the teachers, 
parents, and persons in various circles in society who have 
worked hard for the healthy growth of children! 
  In this joyful time as we celebrate "1 June" International 
Children's Day, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has written an 
inscription for the Young Pioneers of our country: "Learn 
knowledge yourself, manage yourself, protect yourself, 
strengthen yourself, discipline yourself, and be a qualified 
builder of the socialist undertaking, as well as a successor to 
it." This fully indicates the ardent expectations the CPC 
Central Committee and the old revolutionaries have regarding the 
next generation, and enables Young Pioneer workers in the whole 
country to further pinpoint the duty and orientation of 
education. 
  If China is to gain an edge in the trans-century 
competition, 
if the Chinese nation is to rise, and if millions of people are 
to realize the great aspiration of building a strong and 
modernized socialist country, the ultimate factor is the 
emergence of millions of various kinds of professionals who have 
integrity, knowledge, and good physique. In a modern society 
where science and technology develop rapidly and competition of 
various kinds is intensifying, people have a new understanding 
of a capable person. A capable person's integrity includes not 
only political awareness, of which the basic requirement is to 
uphold the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," 
healthy thinking and sense, and good morals and integrity, but 
also a strong will, positive and rich sentiment, and voluntary 
behavior conforming to legal and social norms. By knowledge we 
mean that this can no longer be purely measured by the degree of 
knowledge we possess; that is to say, one must not only have 
extensive knowledge, but must also have the ability to acquire 
knowledge and to transform knowledge into real productive 
forces. By physique we do not merely mean the concept of a kind 
of physical strength, but also include the strength to struggle 
courageously, as well as a tenacious ability to endure. 
  However, real life is obviously different from people's 
wishes and demands. Among some young students, there are still 
certain acute problems and weaknesses, which cause concern 
throughout society. Therefore, the topic of how we can follow 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's demand that "education must face 
modernization, the world, and the future," to cultivate 
students' all-round quality and enable them to shoulder the 
important trans-century duty, is a strategic topic which badly 
needs attention. 
  Precisely based on this kind of understanding, the All-China 
Children and Juvenile Work Committee has launched a "Five 
Self's" campaign among Young Pioneer organizations. "Five 
Self's" means: Learn knowledge yourself--the cultivation of an 
ability to voluntarily study and to acquire knowledge to become 
a master of knowledge; manage yourself--learn how to 
independently solve problems and difficulties in daily life and 
to possess the basic ability to make a living and work; protect 
yourself--understand the law, social norms, and common knowledge 
of life so as to be able to protect one's legitimate rights and 
intelligently and bravely handle difficulties and even dangers 
one might run into; strengthen yourself--be adventurous and 
confident, have a strong and persistent will, and have the 
courage and ability to overcome difficulties; and discipline 
yourself--voluntarily observe the standards of behavior of 
primary and secondary school students and possess the ability to 
restrain, regulate, and control one's own behavior. 
  Launching the "Five Self's" campaign is a basic project for 
training of capable persons. It meets the characteristics and 
needs of youngsters, and is needed for their healthy growth in 
the future. Its direct purpose is to help children and 
youngsters to learn how to become young masters of daily life 
and to upgrade their sense and ability of living, learning, 
working, and creating. "Five Self's" activities are activities 
belonging to the children and youngsters themselves and is a 
kind of training and learning, and its main principle is 
practice, through which improvement is sought. Children and 
youngsters are the main body and master of activities, and what 
schools, teachers, and Young Pioneers workers have to do more of 
is guidance work and work to pave the road and build bridges. 
  We believe that the inscription written by General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin will certainly further arouse enthusiasm among 
children and youngsters for participation and will enhance their 
rich imaginations, positive enterprising spirit, and potential 
for learning and creation; it will certainly enable the "Five 
Self's" activities to become rich and colorful and score 
numerous great results. We sincerely wish the broad masses of 
children and youngsters who start from here drill to harden 
their wings and soar to great heights.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Despite China's rapid 
economic development, the country's environmental problems are 
coming under control, with only a few regions facing serious 
environmental pollution, the State Bureau of Environmental 
Protection said here today. 
  "Although China is facing increasing pressures from 
environmental problems as the country has taken energy, raw 
materials and other basic industries as the top priorities for 
development, the country has still achieved progress in the 
control of industrial pollution," the bureau said in its annual 
report on the country's environmental and ecological situation. 
  According to the report, in 1993 the amount of smoke and 
dust 
released into the air in urban areas remained the same as in 
1992. 
  "The water quality in rivers, reservoirs, underground and 
offshore remains fine," the report says. 
  "The country's forests are expanding, and the areas of 
nature 
reserves now account for 6.8 percent of the country's total 
territory," the report says. 
  "But the volume of mature forest trees which can be logged 
is 
shrinking," it notes. 
  "The degradation, desertification and saltification of 
grassland are continuing, while the loss of water and soil 
remains serious," the report adds. 
  "Over-exploitation of underground water in urban areas is 
rampant and the deterioration of the eco-environment of the 
country's fishing industry is yet to be controlled," it warns. 
  The report blamed coal burning for the air pollution in many 
of China's cities. "Such air pollution is more serious in 
winter and in big cities than in summer and small towns. 
  "In 1993, more Chinese cities suffered from acid rain than 
in 
the previous year," according to the report. 
  Meanwhile, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of 
Environmental Protection, promised, "China will devote more 
efforts to environmental protection while speeding up economic 
development."

<F P=106> [By Tao Tao: "$6b Investment for Post, Telecom"] </F>
  [Text] China will invest a record of 53.6 billion yuan 
($6.2 billion) into the post and telecommunications sector this 
year to expand and modernize the country's communications 
network. 
  Part of the investment will be used to transform microwave 
lines from analog to digital ones, said the Ministry of Posts 
and Telecommunications. 
  Of the more than 55,000 kilometres of microwave links, 
nearly 
30,000 kilometres of analog microwave lines need to be 
digitalized to increase their transmission capacity. 
  Although China can manufacture digital microwave equipment, 
foreign products are more competitive with sound technology, 
reliability and stability. 
  The ministry is also speeding up the construction of 
high-capacity fibre-optic cables and a nationwide optical cable 
network will be completed by the end of the century. 
  Fibre-optic cables will be the main lines of transmission in 
the country with a planned eight north-south and eight east-west 
lines to be completed in the next six years. By then, more than 
300 cities above prefecture level will be linked up with the 
network. 
  After the committee on the control of exports to communist 
countries was abolished last year, the ban on the export of 
high-capacity optical cables was also lifted by Western 
countries. 
  The ministry is planning to import optical cables, and more 
than 10 foreign companies are competing to sell their products. 
More than 30,000 calls can be made simultaneously on a pair of 
fibre-optics. 
  At present, China can manufacture less powerful fibre 
optical 
cables. 
  And the construction of satellite earth stations are also 
planned by the ministry. It is hoped that each provincial 
capital city will have a satellite earth station by the end of 
the century. 
  The bigger the level of investment and the greater the 
expansion of the nationwide telecommunication network, the more 
opportunities will be available for foreign countries and 
companies to supply their products to China. 
  According to the ministry's plan for this year, another 12 
million telephone lines will be added to the exchange capacity, 
bringing the total switch capacity in the country to 52 million 
lines by the end of this year. 
  There are also plans to install 9 million new telephones, 
compared with 5.9 million new ones added last year. 
  And the ministry aims to push the telephone switch capacity 
to more than 110 million by the end of the century. By then, 
China will have one of the world's largest telephone systems. 
  The rapid expansion of China's telecommunications network is 
expected to continue to benefit overseas partners because a 
large percentage of equipment is imported. 
  To meet the huge domestic demand, a number of joint ventures 
with foreign telecom giants, such as NEC, Siemens and Motorola, 
have been established to manufacture the urgently-needed 
equipment. But further imports of equipment are still needed 
for the domestic market. 
  Although the expansion of the telephone network requires a 
lot of equipment, the ministry will not approve the sale of 
switch equipment to China by new foreign telecom manufacturers. 
At present, the main foreign suppliers of telephone switches 
and joint ventures are Fujitsu (F-150), NEC (NEAX-61), Siemens 
(EWSD), Alcatel (E-lOB), Ericsson (AXE 10), Northern Telecom 
(DMS 100), AT&amp;T (5 ESS) and Shanghai Bell (S-1240). 
  The more competition among the foreign manufacturers, the 
more opportunities and benefits for China, analysts said. 
  Ministry officials said that only digital or stored 
programme 
controlled telephone switches will be imported in the future. 
  On the other hand, the ministry is keen to attract foreign 
loans to assist the development of the sector. 
  A total of $5.1 billion in foreign loans have been used in 
the past decade. And it is expected that more and more foreign 
loans will be used in the future.

<F P=106> [By Gao Tao: "Information Sector Thrives"] </F>
  [Text] China's booming telecommunications industry, is 
rapidly developing a modern nationwide information network. 
  The immediate task is focussing on expanding and upgrading 
the public switched packet data network to meet the growing 
demands for non-voice telecommunications across the country and 
with the world. said an official from the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. 
  The network includes two levels--the backbone network 
(primary switching centres) and regional networks in each 
province, autonomous region and municipality (secondary 
switching centres). 
  The trunk network, containing 5,500 ports, has been finished 
and put into operation. 
  The network includes 696 trunk ports, two international 
gateway ports and one gateway port for Hong Kong and Macao. 
  Data transmission is realized through the public 
telecommunications system, including fibre-optical cables, 
microwave and satellite communications. 
  Through the network, computer owners across the country, who 
join Chinapac [expansion unknown], can exchange information and 
contact with other computer users at home and abroad. 
  By the end of this year. the network will cover 500 Chinese 
cities as local telecommunications administrations are building 
14 provincial networks. Another 15 provincial networks have 
already been established. 
  It is expected that the network will cover all counties in 
East, South and Central China and some counties in West China by 
1995. 
  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications expects that 
the 
number of users of the network will reach 8,000 this year and 
grow to 20,000 by 1995. At present, most of the users are 
financial organizations, banks, stock exchanges, large 
enterprises and government departments. 
  The official stressed that it is important to constantly 
upgrade the network's technology and facilities to meet the 
growing demands of the customers. 
  It is the trend and the plan of the ministry to link up all 
databases in the country through the network, making it possible 
for all to share the information. Methods of dividing the 
profits between databases and telecommunication departments will 
be worked out. 
  The non-voice telecommunications service sector, otherwise 
called value-added service communications, is expected to grow 
by 50 per cent this year and the next. Beyond the next couple 
of years. Services are charted to grow at an annual rate of 30 
per cent between 1996 to 2000. 
  With the further upgrading and expansion of China's public 
telecommunications network, more and more data communications 
will be come possible, such as videotex, e-mail, EDI [Electronic 
Data Interchange] and other services. 
  Videotex integrates data transmission and data processing 
and 
displays the information or image on a computer terminal. 
  The service is now available in Shanghai and will be 
expanded 
to Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Beijing and other big cities. Most 
equipment for the service is imported from France and Germany 
while the rest is domestically made. 
  It is expected that the number of videotex users will grow 
to 
5,000 by the end of next year and to 30,000 by 2000. 
  The e-mail service provides computer networking that 
facilitates the transfer of text, messages, and other 
information among the subscribers. Six such systems have been 
installed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen 
and Qingdao, and each allows 3,000 mailboxes. The average 
capacity of each mailbox is 100.000 bytes. 
  In order to promote wide application of the system, research 
institutes in China have developed technical specifications and 
requirements for E-mail service. The wide application of E-mail 
will greatly increase the demand for the public switched packet 
data network in China. 
  Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a system allowing 
traders to do business using electronic telecommunications 
rather than papers. It ensures rapid transactions and reduces 
human error. 
  Several Chinese departments and ministries, such as 
telecommunications departments, the electronics industry, banks, 
foreign trade and customs, are jointly working to establish a 
national EDI system. 
  It is planned that a nationwide EDI system will be formed by 
2000 and connected with the international network. It is also 
believed that China will lose a competitive edge in foreign 
trade if the development of the EDI system is delayed. 
  EDI systems have been adopted by many countries. Customs 
clearance among most European countries and the United States 
are done by using EDI. It was reported that 95 per cent of 
foreign trade in Singapore is conducted through EDI. 
  The ministry plans to expand and link up all public 
telephone 
directory inquiry systems and information services databases 
across the country operated by themselves . 
  The information service databases, the 168 access code on 
the 
public phone network, will be one of the main targets for 
development in the future. Whenever the customer needs 
information, if they just dial 168 they will get all they need.

(7051 6855 0036): "Central Military Commission Vice Chairman 
Zhang Zhen Stresses Key to Training Reform Lies in Improvement 
of Cadre Quality"] 
  [Text] Zhengzhou, 21 May (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Use as guidance 
Mao Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army 
building in the new period, firmly grasp the key of improving 
the quality of the contingent of cadres, deepen reform of 
military training, comprehensively satisfy the general demands 
put forward in the "five points" by Chairman Jiang of the 
Military Commission, and better perform the fundamental duties 
of the armed forces. This is what General Zhang Zhen, vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed while 
conducting investigations and studies of units and academies of 
the armed forces garrisoned in Henan. 
  From 2 to 21 May, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen, making light of 
hardships, went deep into the leading organs, academies, and 
training grounds of companies of the armed forces garrisoned in 
Henan and carried out extensive investigations and studies on 
questions centering on how to improve the quality of the 
contingent of cadres and how to deepen reform of military 
training. After fully affirming the achievements in training 
reform made by the units he visited, he pointed out: To do a 
good job in training reform, we must use as guidance Mao 
Zedong's military thinking and Deng Xiaoping's ideas on army 
building during the new period. Mao Zedong's military thinking 
has summed up the experience of how our poorly equipped armed 
forces defeated their much better equipped enemy over several 
decades and has crystalized the collective wisdom of the older 
generation of proletarian revolutionaries. Deng Xiaoping's 
ideas on army building in the new period have inherited and 
developed Mao Zedong's military thinking and are the theoretical 
basis for guiding the building and reform of the armed forces. 
So long as we seriously study them and arm our brains with 
them, we will be able to make new breakthroughs in training 
reform. 
  In the course of conducing investigations and studies, Vice 
Chairman Zhang Zhen stressed from a strategic plane the extreme 
importance of having our eyes on the future, giving special 
attention to properly grasping the training of cadres, and 
training comprehensively qualified personnel in deepening 
training reform, and increasing the combat power of the armed 
forces. He said: In training cadres, we should focus on 
improving quality in four aspects. The first is to improve 
political quality. Study of the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and education on world outlook 
should be regarded as basic lessons so that our cadres will 
really heed what the party says and will have lofty communist 
ideals. The second is to improve the military quality. They 
should be proficient in tactics and strategies and should master 
the skills of training the armed forces in times of peace and 
the skills of directing battles in times of war. The third is 
to improve the quality of science and culture. A modern war is 
fought under conditions of high technology. Without knowledge 
of science and culture, it is difficult to study and control a 
war. Besides, at a time when socialist modernization is 
developing rapidly, it will be very difficult for cadres 
transferred from the armed forces to adapt themselves to 
civilian posts if they do not have knowledge of science and 
culture. The fourth is to improve the quality of management. 
Importance should be attached to training cadres' about the 
actual ability to lead troops so that they can constantly 
improve the level of management in the armed forces. 
  Vice Chairman Zhang showed great concern for building 
academies. On his way, he cordially visited teaching staff at 
all of the academies; asked in detail about ideology, studies, 
and the lives of the students; and discussed with them how to 
further strengthen the building of academies. He said: We 
should mainly depend on academies in training cadres. Training 
given in academies should enable the fine traditions of the 
armed forces to strike roots in the brains of the students, to 
develop in the armed forces, and to maintain them there forever. 
We should strive to narrow the gap between training in the 
academies and the needs of the armed forces and should earnestly 
build academies into important bases for training cadres. 
  At present, many comrades have never taken part in a war. It 
is difficult to master the real skills of commanding war 
operations through exercises and maneuvers based on the 
imagination. How should this problem be solved? Vice Chairman 
Zhang said: The best way is to study examples of battles fought 
by our armed forces. We should, through such studies, increase 
our understanding of Mao Zedong's military thinking, solve the 
problem of how cadres without experience of war can acquire 
skills in fighting battles, and solve the problem of 
establishing confidence to darer to fight and to win. In 
studying examples of battles, we should first study examples of 
battles fought by our own armed forces before we study those 
fought by other armed forces, including examples of battles 
fought by foreign armed forces. On the basis of this, we should 
study new measures to cope with a modern war fought under 
changed and developed conditions. 
  Making light of rugged mountain paths and a high temperature 
of 34 degrees centigrade, Vice Chairman Zhang stooped and 
entered tents as hot as food steamers to cordially visit 
soldiers of units which were garrisoning and carrying out 
exercises in the open country. He told leaders present that 
they should provide good food for the fighters because 
conditions of garrisoning and carrying out exercises in open 
country were very tough. He also looked with great interest at 
the newly upgraded training equipment used by the armed forces 
and their academies. He repeatedly emphasized: The objective 
of carrying out reform of training must be clear and we should 
not practice formalism. We should properly integrate men with 
weapons and should strive to increase the actual effects of 
training. 
  At the end of his investigations and studies, Vice Chairman 
Zhang also made an important speech on deepening study of Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and 
unswervingly upholding the party's basic line for 100 years, on 
implementing the "Program for Building Grass-Roots Army Units" 
in order to comprehensively strengthen the building of 
grass-roots army units, on upholding the principle of supporting 
militia activities with production and doing both production and 
militia duties and making great efforts to promote the building 
of militia and reserve forces, and on further improving 
leadership style and properly carrying out work in various 
aspects.

such weapons would produce powerful effects in wars against

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (AFP)--China appeared to leave the 
door open Thursday [2 June] to possibile sanctions against 
Pyongyang, while reaffirming its commitment to resolving the 
Korean nuclear crisis through negotiation. Fresh "difficulties" 
had emerged in resolving the crisis but "I don't think things 
have yet reached a point where the final resort has to be 
adopted," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofeng, giving 
the first indication that sanctions might be an option if the 
situation on the Korean peninsula deteriorates further. 
However, Shen stressed that "at this time" Beijing was opposed 
"to resorting to means that might sharpen the confrontation." 
  The row over the nature of North Korea's nuclear programme 
intensified recently after Pyongyang rejected a request by the 
UN Security Council to suspend the removal of fuel rods from a 
five- megawatt reactor, suspected by the United States of being 
a nuclear bomb factory. 
  Shen said China's stance that the dispute should be solved 
through negotiation "remains unchanged." "I believe that as 
long as the parties concerned remain calm ... the difficulty is 
likely to be overcome," he added. 
  North Korea issued a new threat Thursday to withdraw from 
the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if the United Nations and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continued to 
pressure Pyongyang to accede to their nuclear inspection 
demands. The IAEA says the fuel rod operation at the Yongbyon 
reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang, is crucial 
for determining whether any plutonium has been secretly diverted 
for military use.

<F P=106> [By Sheel Kohli in London] </F>
  [Text] The London Stock Exchange (LSE) and leading British 
securities house Smith New Court will be beefing up their 
programme to capture Chinese business when a high-level 
delegation from the Shenzhen stock exchange and senior company 
directors visit London next week. 
  Both the LSE and Smith New Court are regarded as having 
suffered during the second batch of 22 Chinese state listings, 
because British securities houses have not been able to win much 
business. 
  All secondary listings outside Hong Kong have been targeted 
for New York rather than London. 
  Privately, British securities firms have been smarting from 
the bias that appears to have been shown to U.S. firms, such as 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have done well out of 
the present tranche of H share listings. 
  In the three-day trip high-ranking state officials, led by 
Shenzhen vice-mayor Zhang Hongyi, will meet LSE officials and 
Smith New Court's chairman Sir Michael Richardson and chief 
executive Michael Marks. 
  Liu Xinhua, the deputy commissioner for the Shenzhen 
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Yu Guogang, the deputy 
chief executive of the Shenzhen stock exchange, will be part of 
the delegation. 
  In addition, directors from some of Shenzhen's largest 
listed 
companies will also be attending, including Liu Fengyi, director 
and vice-president of the Shenzhen SEZ [Special Econmoic Zone] 
Real Estate group, and Chen Pingan, director and vice-president 
of China Bicycle Co Holdings. 
  They will arrive on Sunday morning and will stay until 
Wednesday, when the U.S. stockbroker Merrill Lynch is flying the 
delegation to New York for a similar exercise. 
  Henry Ingrouille, the London exchange's international 
relations analyst who will be helping to host the visiting 
delegation, said London was quickly learning from its mistakes 
in not encouraging Chinese companies to list earlier, and was 
now trying to rectify the situation. 
  The LSE will be stressing the similarity between its listing 
requirements and that of Hong Kong, given that Hong Kong's 
system was based on London's. 
  However, Mr Ingrouille admitted that the stock exchange had 
sometimes been the victim of circumstance beyond its control. 
  "There is the political Hong Kong factor. We do get varied 
messages. Some times we are told that it has no bearing, and 
then we are told more informally that it does have an impact." 
  He said that in recent months there had been much greater 
interest from Chinese companies regarding listing in London, 
although he admitted that the exchange would be too late to 
benefit from the present group of 22 state companies that had 
been lined up for flotation. 
  Chinese companies are showing an increasing awareness of the 
capital raising ability of London. Presently there are three 
bonds fully listed on the exchange, issued by China, the 
People's Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank. 
  Richard Margolis, head of Smith New Court in Hong Kong, said 
the delegation included seven Chinese companies, including China 
Bicycle and Shenzhen SEZ Real Estate, and they would be giving 
presentations at a meeting of the stockbroker's institutional 
clients. 
  London's present efforts appear to have begun to pay off, 
and 
privately exchange officials expect to see secondary listings of 
Chinese companies in London within the next year. 
  Nigel Atkinson, the exchange's head of listings, has just 
returned from a trip to China, having secured a memorandum of 
understanding with the Shanghai stock exchange. 
  Moves are presently afoot to set up a more wide-ranging 
arrangement with the Chinese Securities and Regulatory 
Commission.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--Police detained a team of 
three journalists from the U.S. television network CBS near 
Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Friday and held them for two 
hours, one of the journalists said. 
  The American journalists and their Chinese driver were taken 
to a police station for an identity check and questioning after 
filming on the square ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 
4, 1989 crushing of the pro-democracy movement. 
  All their videotape was confiscated, the journalist told 
AFP, 
adding that police had accused the CBS team of working without 
authorization and having filmed the heavy security deployments 
on the square. 
  Fearing incidents commemorating the massacre, the government 
has stepped up police surveillance around the Chinese capital.

<F P=106> [By reporter Si Liang (1835 5328): "The Mainland Steps Up </F>
the Crackdown on Kidnapping Gangs"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 23 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the 
beginning of this year, the number of kidnapping cases of 
various types has increased substantially, and the law and order 
situation has become rather serious. The public security organs 
are analyzing deeply the causes and backgrounds of the crimes, 
intensifying their investigations to crack the cases, and 
striving to check the increase in kidnapping activities in order 
to guarantee social stability and to ensure the smooth 
development of reform and opening up. 
  According to materials provided by the police, in the last 
few years, kidnapping cases have increased substantially. In 
particular, such cases have doubled and redoubled in the coastal 
areas and in Guangdong's Zhujiang Delta. For example, in the 
first quarter of last year, the kidnapping cases handled by the 
procuratorial organs in Shanghai alone increased by 50 percent 
over the previous year; and in the first half of last year, more 
than 200 kidnapping cases occurred in Guangdong, including 54 
cases in Guangzhou, or 125 percent of the figure in the previous 
year, and 52 cases in Foshan, or 550 percent of the figure in 
the previous year. According to the mainland police, in the 
first four months of this year, at least two major kidnapping 
cases occurred every month, and most of such cases occurred in 
Guangdong. 
  Gangsters in the mainland mainly kidnap individual business 
proprietors, private entrepreneurs, and businessmen from Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. They demand from several tens of 
thousands of yuan to several hundred thousand yuan ransom. In 
some cases, the kidnappers even demand several million or over 
10 million yuan. For example, the most serious kidnapping case 
over the past more than 40 years occurred in Guangdong in April 
1993. Six kidnappers kidnapped the director of an aluminum 
product factory and his wife in Nanhai City, Guangdong, and 
demanded ransom of 10 million yuan. The victims were robbed of 
their Lexus car, Rolex wristwatch, gold jewelry, cellular phone, 
and other belongings with a total worth of more than 1 million 
yuan when being kidnapped. As another example, the police in 
Fuzhou City cracked a kidnapping case in April this year in 
which the boss of a karaoke lounge was kidnapped and the 
kidnappers demanded $400,000 in ransom. In another case, a Hong 
Kong businessmen, who invested in a number of projects in the 
mainland, was kidnapped by four armed gangsters last January in 
Shenzhen, and 800,000 yuan ransom was demanded. Then, in April 
this year, the Hong Kong boss of a metal plant in Shenzhen's 
Nanshan was kidnapped by four gangsters, who demanded 200,000 
yuan ransom. 
  According to information from the cracked cases, many 
kidnappers acted in an organized way, and the crime syndicates 
bore the character of secret societies. They collaborated 
closely through division of work; acted surreptitiously; and in 
some cases even possessed firearms. They also used cellular 
phones, pagers, cars, and other modern means of communication 
and transportation in the act. The kidnappers were cruel and 
merciless in their treatment of their victims, and often 
recklessly killed them. For example, the police cracked a case 
late last year in which the son of a criminal police team leader 
in Liaoyuan City was kidnapped and killed; the Daya Bay Public 
Security Bureau cracked a case in March this year in which an 
individual business proprietor was kidnapped for 3.6 million 
yuan ransom and was later killed; and the police in Zhuhai City 
recently cracked a case in which a Macao businessman was 
kidnapped in Gongbei for 360,000 Hong Kong dollars ransom and 
was later killed. 
  A more shocking fact was that cases of youngsters being 
kidnapped by youngsters occurred from time to time. In late 
1993, in the suburbs of Yancheng, Jiangsu, in order to extort 
50,000 yuan from a rich family, three young people from 14 to 16 
years of age kidnapped a nine-year-old boy by imitating the plot 
of a videotape. In March this year, an 18-year-old secondary 
school student in Xixia County, Henan, even kidnapped a 
12-year-old boy for 60,000 yuan ransom, and the victim, who was 
the son of a police officer of the county's public security 
bureau, was later killed by the kidnapper. 
  However, "the net of Heaven has a large mesh, but it lets 
off 
nothing evil--justice has a long arm." Most kidnapping cases 
were cracked by the public security personnel, and most 
kidnappers were brought to justice. In the first eight months 
of last year, more than 30 kidnappers were arrested, tried, and 
sentenced in Guangdong. Five of them were sentenced to death; 
two were sentenced to death with suspension; two were sentenced 
to life imprisonment; and seven were sentenced to imprisonment 
of various terms. Capital punishment was inflicted on all four 
kidnappers in the most serious kidnapping case involving 10 
million yuan ransom in Guangdong.

  [Text] Moscow, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin today proposed the holding of a multi-lateral meeting to 
settle the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula in a phone 
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton who was in Rome on 
a European trip. 
  The two presidents agreed to have experts further study the 
issue and make recommendations. 
  According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Clinton today also 
gave a phone call to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is 
visiting Moscow, to discuss the situation in the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The contacts between the presidents notably occurred after 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a report 
to the U.N. Security Council earlier that the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has made it impossible for 
international inspectors to determine whether spent nuclear fuel 
was diverted to a secret weapons program in 1989. 
  Pyongyang denied such a report the same day, arguing that 
its 
operation to discharge the spent fuel from a five megawatt 
nuclear power reactor is being done in a manner that will 
maintain the ability to take measurements later. 
  It accused the IAEA of attempting to internationalize and 
politicalize a technical issue to pursue a "sinister political 
purpose." 
  According to a statement issued by the U.S. State Department 
in Washington today, the U.S. has already begun consultations 
with its allies and the U.N. Security Council on sanctions 
against DPRK. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the DPRK Embassy in Austria 
announced in Vienna today that DPRK has proposed to the IAEA 
that it can carry out a sample test on the disputed nuclear 
power reactor in Yongbyon. 
  However, Lothar Wedekind, a spokesman for IAEA, said he knew 
nothing about it when asked if he was informed of the proposal. 
  He added that the IAEA has never got a clear picture of the 
whole nuclear program of DPRK. 
  But DPRK Ambassador to Austria Kim Kwang-sop insisted that 
the refueling of the nuclear power reactor is only a technical 
issue.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 (AFP)--China is "seriously 
considering" Russian President Boris Yeltsin's call for an 
international conference on the North Korean nuclear standoff, a 
foreign ministry spokesman said Monday. 
  "China believes that the most practical and effective 
framework so far for properly settling this issue is the 
trilateral dialogue between the four parties" -- North and South 
Korea, the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. 
  But nevertheless China would study seriously Moscow's call 
for a multilateral conference, he added. 
  Since the North Korean nuclear crisis began about 18 months 
ago, Beijing has refused to consider it an international issue 
and has tried to block most initiatives taken within the United 
Nations. 
  Instead China, which is Pyongyang's only ally, has pushed 
for 
the United States to talk directly with the communist regime in 
the hope that this would eventually lead to Washington's 
official recognition of Pyongyang. 
  In March, China snubbed a similar Russian call for a 
multilateral conference because it countered its own efforts to 
force the Americans to talk directly with Pyongyang. 
  The United States has called for sanctions against Pyongyang 
following the IAEA report to the Security Council that it was 
unable to verify whether North Korea removed plutonium from its 
Yongbyon nuclear plant to make atomic weapons. 
  China, torn between its role as an international power and 
its links with Pyongyang, may take advantage of the Russian 
proposal to delay any UN vote on sanctions which would put it in 
an embarrassing position, diplomatic sources said.

  [Text] United Nations, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not concluded that the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has nuclear 
weapons, IAEA chief Han Blix said here today. 
  The IAEA has "not concluded that the DPRK has one or more 
nuclear weapons, and we have not even concluded that their 
nuclear program is used for non-peaceful purposes," Blix said. 
  After briefing the Security Council and meeting with the 
U.N. 
secretary-general on the nuclear issue in the DPRK, the IAEA 
director-general told reporters that the IAEA is not "saying 
that material is diverted, material has been used for plutonium 
production or indeed for bomb making." 
  On the disputed issue of nuclear rods discharge at the 
DPRK's 
five-megawatt reactor, the IAEA chief said that his agency is 
able to monitor the present situation, but is running into 
obstacles in determining whether the material had been diverted 
in the past as the DPRK has discharged most of the fuel in the 
reactor. 
  According to a press release issued here today by the DPRK 
permanent mission to the U.N., a spokesman for DPRK's General 
Department of Atomic Energy said in a statement on June 2, "We 
are doing the core refueling operations in such a manner that we 
fully preserve technical possibility for later measurement of 
such fuel rods as requested by the Agency (IAEA) in a token of 
good faith."

  [Text] Washington, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The United States has 
already begun consultations with its allies and the U.N. 
Security Council on possible sanctions against the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the State Department 
announced here today. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a 
statement at a news briefing, saying that "We have no basis for 
holding a third round of high level talks with North Korea and 
we will seek further action in the U.N. Security Council." 
  Gallucci said International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
Director- General Hans Blix reported to the U.N. Security 
Council yesterday that the IAEA has now lost the ability to 
accurately measure nuclear fuel discharged from a nuclear 
reactor in the DPRK. 
  The IAEA has said that the loss of this technique means that 
its overall ability to verify the amount of plutonium previously 
produced by the DPRK has been seriously eroded. 
  "Since the beginning of our negotiations with the North 
Koreans last June," Gallucci claimed, "We said that satisfactory 
IAEA safeguards presence during the refueling of the 5-megawatt 
reactor was one essential basis for continuing our dialogue with 
North Korea." 
  Gallucci today began consultations on future steps including 
possible sanctions with a South Korean special envoy in 
Washington. 
  He said he will have trilateral meetings with Japanese 
representatives and the South Korean special envoy tomorrow. 
  The White House also issued a statement today, saying U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, in Rome, telephoned Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is in 
Moscow for a visit, about the situation in the DPRK. 
  Yeltsin has proposed an international conference on the DPRK 
issue. 
  The White House said Clinton told Yeltsin "Such a meeting 
might be appropriate at some poe need first to return the North 
Korean nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council." [sentence 
as received] 
  Clinton and Kim "agreed that the next step is to pursue the 
issue of sanctions" against the DPRK, the White House said.

  [Text] London, June 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. naval manoeuvres in 
the Pacific off Hawaii are a long-scheduled, routine exercise 
and not a show of force to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), U.S National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said in 
Britain Sunday [5 June]. 
  Lake, with President Bill Clinton at D-Day celebration in 
Portsmouth, England, was quoted by REUTER NEWS AGENCY as saying 
the code-named "Rimpac" exercise "is not a show of force for 
North Korea's benefit." 
  The United States have warned of a wave of international 
sanctions against DPRK which has dispute with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency over nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. 
Pyongyang has said the sanctions would be regarded as war. 
  The U.S naval manoeuvre has aroused fears that tension on 
the 
Korean Peninsula would escalate. But Lake said the exercise was 
not targeted on DPRK. 
  "There has been a long-scheduled routine exercise involving 
the United States and other nations," Lake said, "we are not 
making any new deployment or redeployment."

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese and United 
Nations officials today agreed that they will continue to 
strengthen consultations so as to fully complete the preparatory 
work for the Fourth World Conference on Women. 
  Liu Huaqiu, vice-chairman of the Chinese organizing 
committee 
of the fourth world conference and vice-minister of foreign 
affairs, held talks with Ebrima K. Jobarteh, head of a study 
group from the U.N., at the State Guesthouse here this morning. 
  During the talks both felt very pleased with the progress 
made during the group's study tour of China. 
  Liu said the Chinese Government places great importance on 
the Fourth World Conference on Women to be held here next year

the conference. 
  He said: "We appreciate the practical and cooperative 
attitude that the study group has shown during its consultations 
with the Chinese representatives." 
  He said that some suggestions and opinions voiced by the 
study group "will be of great benefit to the preparatory work 
for the conference." 
  Liu said the study group also established good cooperative 
ties with the Chinese personnel during its stay in Beijing. 
  He described the work that the study group has done in 
Beijing as fruitful, adding that the Chinese side was satisfied 
with this. 
  He said that the organizing committee and the U.N. study 
group should maintain contacts and enhance cooperation so as to 
ensure the smooth convocation of the conference. 
  Jobarteh said that the study group had seen that the Chinese 
have taken a positive attitude toward the conference in a spirit 
of friendly cooperation. 
  "We are deeply inspired by the great progress made during 
the 
consultations over the past few days," he added. 
  Jobarteh said: "We are deeply convinced after our study tour 
that the preparatory work can be fully completed and the meeting 
will achieve a great success as long as the two sides strengthen 
consultations, expand cooperation and coordinate with each 
other."

<F P=106> [By U.S.-based station reporters Lu Weichang (7120 0251 </F>
2490) and Wang Chunquan (3769 2504 0356); from the "National 
News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] A ceremony was held at the World Bank headquarters 
today for signing documents on World Bank loans totaling $880 
million for four projects in China. Li Daoyu, Chinese 
ambassador to the United States, and (?Kachi), World Bank vice 
governor in charge of East Asian and Pacific affairs, signed 
legal documents on the World Bank loans on behalf of China and 
the World Bank respectively. 
  The four projects are the Huang He Valley's (?Xiaolangdi) 
key 
water conservancy project, the (?Xiaolangdi) resettlement 
project, Shanghai's environmental protection program, and 
Tianjin's industrial development project. 
  At the document signing ceremony, Ambassador Li Daoyu 
pointed 
out that smooth implementation of the four projects would be 
conducive to promoting China's economic construction and that 
China would continue to maintain and develop cooperation with 
the World Bank. (?Kachi) said China has been properly 
implementing projects financed by the World Bank and that the 
signing of the four loan agreements signaled fresh results from 
the World Bank's cooperation with China. He specifically 
stressed: The (?Xiaolangdi) resettlement project is a model of 
the World Bank's cooperation with China and has opened up a way 
for other countries to build large water conservancy facilities 
and properly handle the resettlement issue using World Bank 
loans. 
  Wang Liansheng [3769 6647 3932; identified by caption], 
China's resident executive director at the World Bank, told 
reporters: 
  [Begin recording] In China, we use World Bank loans mainly 
for agricultural water conservancy projects, communications, 
energy, and environmental protection. We have carried out the 
projects pretty well and won unanimously favorable comments from 
the World Bank's (?Board of Executive Directors) by virtue of 
the experiences and situation over the past few years. China 
has now become the biggest recipient nation of World Bank loans.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- The 18th Pacific Science 
Congress will be held in Beijing in June next year to discuss 
issues that have a direct bearing on the continued social and 
economic development of the world, especially that in the 
Pacific region. 
  Some 1,500 influential scientists and social activists from 
over 50 countries worldwide are expected to attend the 
conference, launched by the Pacific Science Association, said 
Zhou Guangzhao, the association chairman. 
  Zhou, also president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
said 
that the congress will focus largely on more than 20 subjects, 
including population explosion, resources crisis, environmental 
deterioration, continued development, South-North cooperation, 
social sciences, medical sciences, culture and art. 
  The Chinese Government is keen on the congress, the first to 
be held in China, Zhou said. The founding congress took place 
in Hawaii in 1920. 
  He said that the congress will display to the world the 
great 
achievements which an ever-opening China has scored in 
scientific, technological, cultural, educational and many other 
spheres. It also will promote scientific and technological 
cooperation and exchange among countries in the Pacific region. 
  The Pacific science association is a multi-discipline non- 
governmental international academic organization, of which China 
is a founding member. 
  According to Zhou, the scale and influence of the Pacific 
Science Congress has actually gone far beyond the Pacific 
region. Scholars and representatives from Britain, France, 
Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Finland 
and some other European countries as well as from many island 
countries in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the 
Atlantic Ocean are expected to take part in the eminent science 
congress. 
  Many international research programs, organizations, 
academic 
exchange and government institutions, as well as prominent 
individuals have shown interest in the subjects to be covered by 
the congress. Some will speak at the congress as special 
guests, Zhou said.

  [Text] Geneva, June 5 (XINHUA) -- The planned Geneva peace 
talks on cease-fire in Bosnia were canceled today because of a 
controversy over the presence of Serb troops around the town of 
Gorazde, according to a U.N. Spokesman. 
  After four days of debate here over the presence of Serb 
troops in the U.N. exclusion zone around Gorazde, Yasushi 
Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, was preparing 
to return to his headquarters, Akashi's spokesman told reporters. 
  "There will be no talks or meetings here in the Palais de 
Nations this afternoon. We will be returning now to our hotels 
and making arrangements to return to Zagreb," Spokesman Michael 
Williams said. 
  The planned talks were to have begun on Thursday [2 June], 
but were postponed because a few dozen armed Serbs were reported 
still to be in the three-kilometer zone, as a result of which 
Bosnian Muslim leaders announced a boycott. 
  During the next two days, the U.N. applied pressure on 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to withdraw the remaining 
troops from the zone immediately and salvage the peace talks. 
  The U.N. peacekeepers then declared that there were no armed 
Serbs remaining in the zone, but later announced that some were 
indeed still present in the western portion of the zone. 
  Williams said Akashi had received assurances from Karadzic 
that U.N. peacekeepers could take over the Serb position in the 
zone and had invited vice-president of the Muslim-led Bosnian 
Government, Ejup Ganic, to the talks. 
  But shortly afterwards, the spokesman announced that Ganic 
had announced a boycott and the talks were canceled. 
  Reports quoted Bosnian Government sources as saying that 
Ganic will send Akashi a letter explaining his government's 
reasons for not entering the negotiations while armed Serbs 
remain around Gorazde. 
  The talks between Serbs, Muslims and Croats were intended to 
establish a total cease-fire in Bosnia and represent the latest 
move by the international community to bring an end to the 
two-year-old civil war which has claimed some 200,000 lives in 
the former Yugoslav republic. 
  Earlier last week, the Muslim-led government in Bosnia said 
it would not attend the peace talks unless the Serbs withdrew 
their troops from around Gorazde.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by staff reporter Bao Shishao (7637 0013 4801): </F>
"Clinton's Trip to Western Europe"] 
  [Text] Washington, 31 May (RENMIN RIBAO)--U.S. President 
Bill Clinton left for Europe 1 June. This is his second trip to 
Europe this year following his first visit to Eastern Europe and 
former Soviet Union regions earlier this year, suggesting once 
again that the United States is focusing on Europe in its 
diplomatic strategy. 
  During the eight-day visit, apart from taking part in 
ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing 
by the U.S. and its allied forces during World War II, Clinton 
will visit Italy, Britain, and France, and meet with the leaders 
of these countries to exchange views on problems of mutual 
concern. Since assuming office at the White House, Clinton has 
repeatedly stressed the importance of the Asia-Pacific region to 
the United States. Some people believe the fact that Clinton 
attended the APEC forum held in Seattle last November shows the 
United States. has shifted its strategic priority to the east. 
However, Clinton emphasized once again that Europe is important 
to the U.S. global interest and that Western European countries 
remain U.S. allies. His current visit to Europe is exactly 
designed to improve U.S. relations with European countries. 
  Since last year, the United States has gotten into a dispute 
with Italy over Somalia, the "special relationship" between the 
United States and Britain has greatly weakened, and the United 
States, on the one hand, and Britain and France, on the other, 
have been divided over ways to settle the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Clinton will have extensive exchange of 
views with leaders of these countries on matters of mutual 
concern to reach an understanding. However, according to a U.S. 
government official, Clinton does not expect too much of the 
current trip to Europe. 
  The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now at a crucial 
moment. Since the beginning of this year, both the United States 
and Russia have actively helped solved the crisis in their 
interest, making Western European countries feel they are left 
out in the cold. Though the foreign ministers from the United 
States, Russia, and five European countries held a meeting on 
the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva not long ago, the 
three parties, namely the United States, Russia, and European 
countries failed to iron out their differences. Recently France 
proposed to withdraw part of its troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and this clearly served as a warning to the United States. In 
France's view, since they have sent more troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina than other countries, they should have more 
say on the issue. France ardently hopes the United States will 
send ground forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina to shoulder part of the 
task of keeping peace and, at the same time, apply pressure on 
the Muslims so that they will return to the negotiating table. 
But the United States continues to bring great pressure to bear 
upon the Serbs, and the U.S. Senate even decided to unilaterally 
lift the embargo on weapons shipments to Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
opposed reducing sanctions against Yugoslavia. The media here 
believe the problem concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina is clearly 
high on the agenda of this meetings with European leaders. 
  The U.S.-European relationship has undergone a change since 
the Cold War ended. Europe is increasingly at odds with the 
United States, but the latter, as a superpower, is still trying 
in every possible way to control Europe's affairs, though it is 
not as strong as before. Clinton's current trip to Europe is 
undoubtedly planned to attain this strategic objective though 
whether his effort will prove successful or not is another 
matter.

  The remarks were made recently by some Beijing-based 
representatives and managers from U.S. companies, who also said 
that the rapid pace of the Chinese economy also provides U.S. 
enterprises favorable opportunities, which they should take to 
expand their presence here. 
  The companies, including General Motors (GM), Apple 
Computers, Caltex Oil, Ford, McDonnell Douglas (MDC), Motorola, 
United Technology (UTC), Du Pont and AT&amp;T, all have success 
stories in China. 
  GM, ranked first on FORTUNE magazine's top 500 corporations 
for the last two years in a row, has established two joint 
ventures in China to produce trucks and advanced electronic fuel 
injection systems respectively. And the auto giant has also 
secured six licenses to manufacture other auto components. 
  "GM will be committed to the Chinese automotive market," 
said 
Richard Donnelly, vice-president of GM and group executive for 
the GM powertrain group. "We want to support local 
manufacturing and technological growth." 
  Donnelly made his China tour recently to donate engine 
transmissions to China's Ministry of Machinery Industry, Qinghua 
University and the Beijing Institute of Technology. 
  He said that GM's business focus in China would be 
components 
manufacturing in support of the industrial policy and plan made 
by the Chinese Government. 
  The corporation has made an overall investment plan in 
China, 
he said, adding that 20 to 25 cooperative projects were under 
discussion between GM and China and agreements on several of 
them would be reached within the year. 
  Donnelly was convinced that GM would continue its success in 
China, just as it had done in other countries. 
  The Apple Computer Company, the largest vendor of personal 
computers in the U.S. last year, occupied only less than five 
percent of China's PC market. However, Robin Abrams, 
vice-president of Apple Pacific, indicated that Apple would take 
20 percent of the China market within two or three years. 
  David Tang, marketing director of Apple China/Hong Kong, 
predicted that China would become one of the largest PC markets 
before 1997 with annual sales of one million sets. 
  In order to occupy the market, Apple would introduce to 
China 
its newly-developed Power Macintosh computers, which debuted at 
the Apple Computer Technology Forum held in Beijing June 1-3. 
  Tang said that Apple planned to sell 20 thousand Macintosh 
computers including thousands of power Macintoshes. 
  It was the best opportunity to enter into the China market 
since China was still using lots of DOS systems rather than 
advanced Windows systems due to lack of Chinese software, Tang 
said. 
  Apple was looking for Chinese partners to co-develop Chinese 
software, Tang said, adding that there were 20 Macintosh 
software programs applicable in China now. 
  He also disclosed that the company had established a 
joint-venture in Shandong Province to develop software and had 
65 distributors across the country. 
  Caltex Oil Company, which entered China at the beginning of 
the century, resumed its China business in the late 1970s. Till 
now, the company has established extensive business contacts 
with its Chinese partners and set up several joint ventures. 
  In 1980, Caltex began to export crude oil for China's Daqing 
Oil Field, becoming the first foreign oil company of this kind. 
  After that, Caltex started to build filling stations in 
Shenzhen, and the business of a Caltex-Shanghai joint venture is 
the mixture and sale of lubrication oil. Two oil depots and an 
asphalt depot were built by the company in south China's Zhuhai 
and Shenzhen cities and Shandong Province. According to a 
senior Caltex official, the company's commitment to the Chinese 
market would increase to meet China's rising need for energy.

  [Text] Ottawa, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- Canadian Governor General 
Ramon John Hnatyshyn met Wu Bangguo, head of a Shanghai 
Municipality delegation, at the Governor's Mansion on 1 June. 
  Hnatyshyn told Wu Bangguo: Now is the opportune time to 
develop Canadian-Chinese relations. China's economy has 
developed rapidly. Canada can become China's economic 
cooperation partner. 
  Hnatyshyn welcomed the exhibition of Shanghai commodities in 
Toronto. He said: The Shanghai commodities exhibition benefits 
both sides. 
  Hnatyshyn had toured Shanghai during his April visit to 
China. He said: Although Canada is only in the initial stages 
of setting up joint ventures in Shanghai, the number of such 
ventures has increased 400 percent over the past two years, 
presenting vast potential in this respect. 
  Wu Bangguo told Hnatyshyn that the purpose of his visit was 
to increase bilateral economic cooperation, and that he had 
brought along proposals for some projects that can be launched 
in conjunction with Canada. He said: The Shanghai commodities 
exhibition, which opened on 30 May, has progressed smoothly, 
recording $12 million in transactions on the first day. 
  On the same day, Canadian Industry Minister John Manley also 
met with Wu Bangguo. The two sides held talks on issues of 
common interest.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 KYODO -- The North Korean 
ambassador to China Saturday [4 June] called on the United 
States to sit down to talks with the North, laying out his 
government's plans to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said economic sanctions against 
Pyongyang would be taken as "a declaration of war" and "the DPRK 
(North Korea) will survive economic sanctions and will achieve 
victory in this struggle." 
  Chu laid out the contents of a package solution that his 
government hopes to put forward if and when the third round of 
talks with the U.S. takes place. 
  "Firstly we will accept the routine and ad hoc inspections 
to 
the safeguards agreement, secondly we will reenter the NPT 
(Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty) and thirdly when the 
(clarified) modulated reactor is replaced by the light water 
reactor we will abolish the (higher) chemical laboratory," he 
said. 
  Chu said that in the second round of talks early last summer 
the U.S. offered to replace the present reactor with a light 
water reactor which does not produce plutonium waste. 
  He further accused the U.S. of wanting to prolong its 
"occupation" of South Korea by first creating the "so-called 
nuclear issue" and then by refusing to supply the light water 
reactor, which would end suspicions of plutonium diversion. 
  North Korea has special status in the NPT, Chu said, due to 
the suspension of its declaration in March last year to withdraw 
from the organization. 
  Chu also ruled out North Korean participation in a 
Russian-proposed international conference, saying the nuclear 
issue can be solved only through talks between the U.S. and 
North Korea. 
  The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has been 
seeking widespread support for U.N. Security Council sanctions 
against the North. 
  The 16-month-long standoff reached a new level last weekend 
when the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear 
watchdog body, said Thursday it will not be able to determine 
whether North Korea has diverted nuclear material for a bomb 
after Pyongyang refused agency inspectors from supervising the 
refueling of its 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor a 
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. 
  North Korea denies allegations by the U.S., South Korea and 
other Western-bloc nations that it is building nuclear weapons.

  [Excerpt] Since it has become impossible to inspect DPRK's 
process of replacing nuclear fuel rods, the United Nations has 
begun to talk about the possibility of imposing economic 
sanctions against the DPRK. While this is going on, the North 
Korean Ambassador to China issued a warning, saying that 
imposition of economic sanctions will be viewed as a declaration 
of war against the DPRK. 
  [Begin recording of DPRK Ambassador Chu Chang-chun in 
Korean] 
We have already informed our friendly nations that we would 
regard any economic sanctions against us as a declaration of 
war. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will win, win, 
and win over in its fight against the economic sanctions sought 
by the United States. [end recording] [subtitles in Japanese on 
screen read: We have already informed the nations concerned that 
we would regard economic sanctions as a declaration of war 
against us. We will win at the end even if economic sanctions 
are imposed.] 
  In this way, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun explained North 
Korea's stand that it will remain unperturbed even if economic 
sanctions are imposed against the DPRK. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article from the "New Talk" column: "China Still Wishes To </F>
See Peace and Stability on the Korean Peninsula"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton, who plans to leave for 
Normandy in France the day after tomorrow to attend ceremonies 
marking the 50th anniversary of D-Day, announced yesterday in 
Rome that he will urge the UN Security Council to impose 
sanctions on Korea. On the day of the ceremonies in Normandy, 
the UN Security Council will deliberate the issue and vote on a 
decision. This fully shows that, although approximately 50 
years have elapsed since the war and despite the end of the Cold 
War, conflicts still exist in the world, which is by no means 
tranquil. 
  In his remarks in Rome, Clinton said that he had a 
conversation with ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who is in Moscow, 
and they had reached an agreement, which he said had the support 
of Russia and China as well. We must still wait for the changes 
in the situation next week to see whether this is true. 
  Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA], 
who arrived in Pyongyang to examine the nuclear fuel rods 
replaced by Korea, said that, after their arrival in Pyongyang, 
Korea did not stop withdrawing the fuel rods, and, therefore, 
they could not verify whether nuclear material had been 
transferred for other military purposes or even for making 
A-bomb. Following their return to the Vienna headquarters, they 
sent Director-General Blix to New York to report the latest 
developments in Korea's nuclear crisis to the UN Security 
Council. After listening to his account, the UN Security 
Council will have to decide on countermeasures. The sanctions 
Clinton mentioned in his remarks in Rome yesterday constitute 
one of these measures. 
  The latest news shows that there is still room for maneuver, 
however. A Korean official said that the fuel rods which were 
removed from the reactor can still be traced and examined, 
because Korean engineers have used a storage method which 
permits reexamination. Korean Ambassador to Vienna Kim 
Kwang-sop also proposed that the IAEA hold a new round of talks 
to break the deadlock. 
  During his visit to Moscow and his meeting with Russian 
President Yeltsin, ROK President Kim Yong-sam discovered that 
Yeltsin's remarks gave consideration to the position of both 
parties. At first, Russia's position was to suspend weapons 
shipments to Korea if necessary. However, Russia also opposed 
imposing UN Security Council sanctions on Korea. This does not 
seem to be fully in line with Clinton's estimates. 
  As for China's attitude, the speech made by Li Daoyu, the 
PRC 
representative to the UN Security Council, and the Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman's reply to reporters both emphasized 
China's opposition to using drastic means and its hope that the 
issue could be resolved through dialogue. 
  Analyses in the U.S. media believe that, while extending 
China's most-favored-nation trading status, in addition to 
economic and trade concerns, President Clinton also took into 
account the U.S. comprehensive ties with Asia, which includes 
improving U.S. ties with Korea through China. In handling the 
Korean issue, the United States must consider the China factor. 
  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, currently in 
Seoul, held talks with Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku and Vice 
Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u and exchanged views on the nuclear 
issue in the Korean peninsula. Both sides reached an agreement: 
In handling the issue, first, peace and stability must be 
maintained on the peninsula; and, second, efforts should be made 
to denuclearize the peninsula. This is China's consistent 
principle, and it will probably be expressed at the Security 
Council's deliberations next week.

"The Situation on the Korean Peninsula Becomes Tense Again"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang Rejects the Security Council's Call 
  The 15-member Security Council passed a resolution a few 
days 
ago calling on the DPRK to fully accept inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of its nuclear 
facilities and requesting that it handle the problem of fuel 
rods with caution. The DPRK responded by rejecting the Security 
Council's call, saying that it is totally unacceptable and 
unjustified. Pyongyang said in its announcement that the IAEA's 
evaluation of the DPRK nuclear issue is based on an erroneous 
assessment and is wholly improper. The DPRK's tough position 
immediately intensified the dispute on the peninsula. 
  The DPRK is continuing the fuel rod removal and refusing 
inspection by international nuclear experts, causing 
dissatisfaction among the United States, the ROK, Japan, and 
other countries. If the DPRK continues to replace those fuel 
rods, the IAEA will not be able to find out whether the DPRK has 
been secretly making nuclear bombs. The IAEA pointed out that 
the DPRK's continuing removal of fuel rods is very serious and 
can be seen as a proof by default that it is indeed developing 
nuclear bombs. 
  The Security Council's call was softer in tone and did not 
sound like an ultimatum, possibly as a result of China's 
influence. China is calling on the United States, the DPRK, the 
ROK, and concerned parties to sit down for frank consultations 
on the "suspicion about nuclear weapons," and to refrain from 
resorting abruptly to actions to isolate the DPRK, although it 
is also stressing its opposition to nuclear armaments on the 
Korean peninsula and its demand that the DPRK accept 
international nuclear inspection. 
Japan Says the DPRK Is About To Launch a Guided Missile 
Test 
  The problem right now is that the DPRK's hardened position 
has made the United States, the ROK, and Japan look at it as a 
very serious matter; and the report acquired by Japan that the 
DPRK might test-fire a large guided missile into the Sea of 
Japan within this week only heated up the media. Japanese 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said on 1 June at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee that if the United Nations 
still fails to come up with a decisive resolution, Japan will be 
prepared to move toward a three-country joint effort to address 
the issue with the United States and the ROK, on the argument 
that the ROK's and Japan's security has a direct bearing on the 
U.S.-Japanese Security Pact. 
  The United Nations will impose a naval blockade to cut off 
ship transport to the DPRK in the case of economic sanctions. 
  Pyongyang is very nervous about such a move and has declared 
that the deployment of U.S. warships to block off the DPRK may 
trigger war. In fact both the DPRK and the ROK have put their 
countries on emergency mobilization footings and readied 
contingency plans in anticipation of war. 
The DPRK Cannot Afford the Cost of War 
  Have developments on the peninsula reached an explosion 
point? I do not believe that the matter can be this simple. 
The DPRK simply cannot take it if hit by full-scale economic 
sanctions. Once the sanctions are in force, remittances by 
Koreans residing in Japan will be cut off, and so will grain and 
oil [qi you 3086 3111] from China, and commodities obtained 
through border trade. Under an economic blockade, very grave 
situations may occur, one of which may be a massive outflow of 
Korean people into first the ROK, and then China and Japan; 
neighboring countries will all be worried. 
  Under economic sanctions, will the DPRK, with its "back to 
the wall," go to war with the ROK? The answer is no. The DPRK 
is worn out economically and, once war begins, it is absolutely 
incapable of sustaining the enormous war expenditure; its 
domestic economy will become a bigger concern. 
  ROK President Kim Yong-sam is visiting Russia, talking with 
Yeltsin on how to solve the DPRK nuclear issue. Once war breaks 
out on the peninsula, Russia will not support the DPRK. The 
Russo-DPRK Friendship Treaty is to due to expire in two years 
and is not something to count on. 
  For the DPRK, the best option is to accept inspection and 
thus dispel international suspicions about its nuclear program. 
This will benefit its relations with the United States, Japan, 
and the ROK and may usher in cooperation and exchange helping it 
to open up to the outside world. For the United States, the 
ROK, and Japan, it is better to pursue peaceful consultations 
with the DPRK and not to resort to sanctions at every turn.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin met with King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath 
Sihanouk of Cambodia here at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here 
this afternoon. 
  Jiang and King Sihanouk spoke highly of Sino-Cambodian 
friendship and hoped that the friendly cooperative relations 
between the two countries will be further developed. 
  Welcoming the king and queen on their official good-will 
visit to China, Jiang said that the visit is a big event in 
bilateral relations, which he believed will push the relations 
to a new height. 
  Jiang said that in the past year, historical changes have 
taken place in Cambodia. Under the leadership of King Sihanouk, 
he said, the country, which had undergone chaos caused by war 
for years, has entered into the stage of restoration and 
reconstruction. 
  The Chinese president said that China appreciates King 
Sihanouk's view of a comprehensive national reconciliation and 
his efforts for such goal. "We hope that under King Sihanouk's 
leadership, the various political parties will properly settle 
the domestic problems by peaceful means and build Cambodia into 
an independent. Peaceful, unified, integrated and prosperous 
country," he said. 
  China hopes that the efforts made by the international 
community will be helpful in promoting Cambodia's national 
reconciliation and peace and stability in the country, Jiang 
said. 
  China and Cambodia have had long-term traditional friendly 
relations, Jiang said. During the Bandung conference in 1955, 
King Sihanouk got to know the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai 
and they opened a new page of bilateral relations between China 
and Cambodia. 
  Jiang said the king had visited China many times and had 
made 
valuable contributions to the friendship between the two 
countries. 
  The Chinese president expressed China's willingness to work 
with Cambodia to further develop the friendly cooperative 
relations in all fields, on the basis of the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence. 
  Sihanouk said that the Cambodian people were very grateful 
to 
the Chinese people and government, as well as to Deng Xiaoping 
and President Jiang, for the support and help in the country's 
reconstruction, and would never forget it. 
  Briefing Jiang on the situation in Cambodia and the recent 
Pyongyang round-table conference, Sihanouk noted that the urgent 
task at present in Cambodia is to realize a ceasefire and peace. 
  Without peace and stability in the country, said Sihanouk, 
there is no way for restoration and reconstruction. 
  The king said that holding the round-table conference was to 
seek peace, adding that the first conference was over now, but 
future efforts were also needed. 
  Sihanouk pointed out that the Cambodian issue can only be 
solved by negotiations and peaceful methods. 
  Taking part in the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of 
China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, and 
senior Cambodian officials accompanying King Sihanouk. 
  Before the meeting, President Jiang presided over a ceremony 
welcoming the Cambodian guests. This evening he hosted a 
banquet in their honor at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

invitation and reception. 
  He said: The Cambodian people are very grateful to the 
Chinese people and government as well as to Deng Xiaoping and 
President Jiang for their support and help for realizing peace, 
stability, and reconstruction in Cambodia. The Cambodian people 
will never forget this. 
  Briefing Jiang on the situation in Cambodia and the recent 
Pyongyang round-table conference, Sihanouk said: The urgent 
task at present in Cambodia is to realize a ceasefire and peace. 
Without peace and stability in the country, there is no way for 
restoration and reconstruction. Holding the round-table 
conference was to seek peace. The first conference is over now, 
but future efforts are also needed. The Cambodian issue can 
only be solved by negotiations and peaceful methods.

  [Text] Paris, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- Rene Monory, president of 
the French Senate, and Giscard d'Estaing, former French 
president and chairman of the French National Assembly's Foreign 
Affairs Committee, on 1 June separately met and feted a 
delegation from the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] 
Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Vice Chairman Zhou Jue. 
  During the meeting, Speaker Monory happily recalled his trip 
to China in February this year. He said he was very concerned 
about China and the development of French-Chinese relations. He 
was delighted at the improvement of French-Chinese relations 
since the beginning of this year. On human rights issues, 
Monory said: Eastern countries are different from Western 
nations; they have their own cultural traditions and historical 
backgrounds. The West cannot demand identical concepts and 
practices from the East. 
  During his meeting, D'Estaing commended the reform and 
opening up polices that China has implemented for many years. 
He also expressed admiration for China's achievements in 
economic construction. 
  He considered it very important for France to improve and 
develop its relations with China. France should keep working 
hard to catch up with other major powers in developing relations 
with China. D'Estaing said: France and China seldom hold 
different viewpoints on international political issues, and they 
have cooperated very well in the UN Security Council. He 
expressed the hope that the two countries would further develop 
economic cooperation and trade while increasing political 
cooperation in the future. 
  Zhou Jue and his entourage arrived in Paris last night at 
the 
invitation of the French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs 
Committee. During its visit to France, the delegation will also 
hold working meetings with the Foreign Affairs Committee.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall and John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A few hundred students at Beijing University 
observed the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre last night 
by holding a silent vigil. At midnight, all lights were on at 
the post-graduate dormitories of the university and many 
students were seen standing out on the balconies. 
  Earlier, authorities at the university, the centre of the 
1989 democracy movement called a meeting of the students to 
ferret out those responsible for passing out commemorative 
leaflets. 
  Security at all of Beijing's major universities was very 
tight with no non-university personnel being allowed on campus 
without first undergoing a rigorous interrogation and 
registration process. 
  Last night, police roadblocks cordoned off the entire 
university area in Haidian District, stopping foreigners' cars 
-- distinguished by their black licence plates -- from entering. 
Every intersection in the college district was guarded by about 
half a dozen police. At least two truckloads of the 
para-military People's Armed Police were seen patrolling around 
Beijing University. 
  Throughout yesterday, the police apparatus threw a tight 
security net over Beijing, covering Tiananmen Square with 
uniformed and plain-clothes police, cutting off dissidents' 
telephones, and banning gatherings. Tiananmen Square was 
swamped with plain-clothes and uniformed police officers 
yesterday morning. Hundreds of plainclothes officers -- some 
disguised as tourists, others not even bothering to conceal 
their identity -- patrolled the square all day. 
  As soon as foreigners entered the square, they were 
immediately followed and videotaped by police armed with a wide 
variety of cameras, walkie-talkies, and mobile phones. 
  Three journalists from the American television network CBS, 
who shot some film on the square yesterday morning, were 
detained by police and questioned for two hours. All their 
videotape was confiscated. 
  Many people had been told by their work units to stay away 
from the square during the anniversary. 
  A screening of the film Farewell to My Concubine at the 
Sino-Japanese Youth Exchange Centre last night was cancelled. 
Callers to the cinema were told it was because the theatre had 
no electricity. However, it appeared the cinema was following 
orders from the police. 
  Dissident Professor Ding Zilin and her husband Jiang Peikun 
went on a three-day fast on Thursday night to protest against 
the heavy police surveillance under which they have lived since 
May 20 and to commemorate those who died five years ago. The 
couple lost their 17-year-old son, Jiang Jielian. 
  The switchboard at People's University, where the couple 
live 
and where they used to teach, cut off their telephone line on 
Thursday at noon. But one caller managed to persuade the 
operator to put a call through yesterday morning. "My son was 
shot between 11.05 and 11.15 on June 3. I don't know when he 
actually stopped breathing but I'll continue to fast until June 
4 because I want to commemorate others who died with him," 
Professor Ding, who has a heart problem, said.

  [Text] "Tell the world", protesting students beseeched 
foreign journalists as the Army stormed its way into the centre 
of Beijing on the night of June 3-4, 1989. 
  Today, five years later, Beijing's students are equally 
anxious that their voice be heard -- but it is a different 
message they want to get across. "I think the Government was 
right to suppress the rebellion, it was a good thing. Our 
country would not be in the position it is today if action had 
not been taken then," said a young undergraduate at the 
prestigious Chinese People's University. 
  "A lot of students and ordinary people think like that. They 
see that China is now quite strong and prosperous, so why should 
you want to disrupt that," he said as he devoured a bowl of 
noodles at one of the numerous privately-run restaurants which 
have sprung up around the campus. "We are now engaged in 
economic construction, that is what people should devote their 
efforts to, not protesting and demonstrating," he added. 
  When told that many people in the West still had an image of 
Chinese students as brave fighters for democracy, the student 
and his friends from the university were flabbergasted. "That's 
ridiculous," one of them said. "You really must report what we 
are really like now." 
  The students said the anniversary of the June 4 massacre had 
no significance for them. They were all in high school at the 
time and did not take part in any of the protests and had no 
sentimental attachment to the movement. "It's ancient history 
now," one of them said. "The only reason we know it's the 
anniversary is because of all these police outside and increased 
security on the gate. Otherwise we wouldn't pay any attention to 
it at all." 
  Nearly all the undergraduates from the People's University 
interviewed on Friday [3 June] and yesterday had a low opinion 
of the 1989 democracy movement. "We can say now the movement 
was badly organised. They did not have clear objectives and did 
not understand the reality of the situation," one said. "People 
like Wang Dan and Wuer Kaixi were actually very poor students, 
they got very bad marks in their exams." 
  They accused Wang Dan of cheating his fellow hunger-strikers 
by sneaking off to restaurants at night and having a good feed 
while the others suffered in the square. Wuerkaixi, they 
claimed, had embezzled funds. "Look at where they are now. How 
can you say these people have achieved anything of note?" 
another student said. 
  While the students insisted that their views were their own 
and were not simply repeating a government line, many graduates 
said their younger colleagues had been brainwashed. "When I was 
at university (in the mid-1980s) all our teachers were open and 
encouraged us to develop new ideas but since 1989 the teachers 
have been much more controlled and have reverted to the old 
style of education," one graduate said. "The Government has put 
a lot of work into so-called patriotic education. And it must 
be said they have been successful," he said. "As you can see 
there really is a big generation gap between my generation and 
the students today."

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (AFP)--Chinese dissident Bao Ge, 
who defied the authorities by setting up a human rights group, 
was detained in Shanghai on the eve of Saturday's fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, a friend said. The 
friend said by telephone that several police went to the home of 
Bao's parents around 11:00 pm (15.00 GMT) Friday after he had 
been to city hall to register his human rights organization. 
  Bao, 31, has also written to the civil affairs ministry to 
officially register the group, which another friend said has 167 
members in several Chinese provinces. The association is 
demanding free trades unions, religious freedom and compensation 
for the families of victims of the Japanese occupation of the 
1930s and 1940s and relatives of the Tiananmen victims, the 
friend said. 
  Bao has been under continual police surveillance since May 
and his telephone has been cut. Other Shanghai dissidents have 
faced the same treatment and at least five have been detained.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (AFP) -- Shanghai dissident Bao Ge 
defied the authorities on Saturday, fifth anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre, asking for official permission to set 
up a human rights organization, one of his friends said. The 
activist wrote to the ministry of civil affairs to formally 
register the group, which already has 167 members in several 
provinces, the friend, a lawyer, said by telephone. His 
application, he said, was filed Saturday -- the fifth 
anniversary of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in 
1989. 
  It was the second such protest to mark the crackdown, which 
according to official count claimed 300 lives. Human rights 
organisations and independent observers say the true toll was 
several thousand, and estimate that several hundred 
demonstrators remain behind bars. In Beijing, a dissident 
teacher, Ding Zilin, and her husband began a 48-hour hunger 
strike on Thursday to protest at weeks-long police harassment. 
The couple's 17-year-old son was killed in 1989. 
  Bao, 31, has been under round-the-clock police surveillance 
since early May. At least five other dissidents have been 
detained by the Shanghai authorities, and they, like Bao, have 
had their phones cut off. 
  Police have thrown a security net around Beijing, especially 
in Tiananmen Square and the university district, which was a 
hotbed of unrest in 1989, in order to forestall any show of 
discontent on the anniversary. 
  Prominent dissidents in the capital who have not been 
rounded 
up have been told to leave the city until the anniversary is 
over.

<F P=106> [By Bao Pu] </F>
  [Text] Five years after the Tiananmen Square crackdown, 
many Chinese live in enforced silence. They suffer helplessly 
and are consumed with anger and dismay. 
  My father, Bao Tong, was arrested suddenly on May 28, 1989, 
in connection with the student movement that spring. Still in 
prison, his health is being ruined by these years of solitary 
confinement. Our family endures endless worry and constant fear. 
  Before his incarceration, Bao Tong was Director of the 
Central Research Institute for Political Reform and a senior 
adviser to the then party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang. Their 
plans for political reform included separating the powers of 
party and state, setting up a fair civil service policy, and 
promoting democratic procedures in the Government. 
  But by 1989, after two years of quiet work, Bao Tong's plans 
for political reform had become virtually impossible to pursue 
due to enormous resistance from the threatened old guard. That 
spring, when the conservatives in the government used the 
student demonstrations to prepare to oust the reformers, Bao 
Tong, along with Mr Zhao, attempted to protect the fragile 
future of political reform and also avoid what they knew could 
be a bloody crackdown on the movement. 
  When the situation intensified and ultimate bloodshed seemed 
unavoidable, Mr Zhao resigned. Later, Mr Zhao was denounced for 
"supporting the turmoil" and "splitting the party." But Bao 
took the blame as the key person behind the unrest, he was 
formally arrested, accused of "counterrevolutionary incitement," 
and finally sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. His 
institute was dismantled and political reform in China came to a 
halt. 
  The efforts of those who attempted to reform the existing 
system were crushed in their efforts to elevate the rights of 
the Chinese citizen. 
  The June 4 crackdown, the imprisonment of Bao Tong, and the 
continuous political repression are not only attacks to crush 
political dissent but also attacks on a fragile idea, the 
recognition of personal dignity, which is just beginning to take 
root in the minds of the Chinese people. 
  In the past, lack of respect for individual lives has led 
the 
Chinese people into numerous catastrophes: Horrors created by 
senseless political campaigns. The Great Leap Forward, the 
People's Communes, and the Cultural Revolution all ended in 
massive devastation. 
  Decisions made by the Chinese leadership in the 1990's have 
continued to reveal a disregard for the individual. Plans to 
displace millions of people for the building of a dam are made 
with no attempt to gain the support of those whose lives would 
be disrupted. Government bonds are frequently given to 
employees in place of wages. The coastal belt and some urban 
areas receive privileged development conditions while the rural 
populations in interior provinces have been left out. 
  These are all potentially volatile situations and if they 
accumulate over time the likelihood of disaster increases. 
  It is unreasonable for Americans to depend on an institution 
such as business, whose bottom line is profit, to be the major 
driving force for promoting lofty principles in China. Yet, 
business itself may be increasingly frustrated by the system of 
coercion and autocracy that remains in China. The nation's 
already rampant corruption is likely to worsen, as there is 
nothing to inhibit its flourishing. 
  China has always fallen into dynastic cycles of the 
establishment of an autocratic regime, corruption and 
oppression, and finally internal rebellion. The longer the 
oppression, the more violent the revolt. The economic boom 
today can be overturned overnight in this unstable system of 
totalitarianism. Patriarch Deng Xiaoping's death followed by a 
power struggle could release the pent-up dissatisfaction of the 
people. 
  Ideas of respect for the individual need to be promoted at 
all levels of Chinese society, or the dynastic cycle will 
continue to take its course. Above all, to respect all human 
lives, to be concerned with human suffering: That is what the 
June 4 movement and human rights are all about.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F>
(7812 5261 0079): "`The Enemy's Presence' Is Discovered in 17 
Provinces and 33 Cities"] 
  [Text] Recently, CPC leaders repeatedly emphasized 
stability and more efforts were made to keep watch on 
dissidents' activities. The reason may be found from the 
following report. 
  At 1800 on 20 May, the State Council General Office and the 
State Council Leading Group in Charge of Public Order called a 
telephone conference of leading party and government cadres in 
charge of public security, state security, and the armed police 
in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to 
report on social and political developments and public order 
throughout the country since the beginning of May. 
<H5>  Organized "Subversive Activities" Have Arisen in 17 </H5>
Provinces and 33 Cities 
  As revealed at the conference, organized hostile underground 
activities of incitation which established ties to subvert the 
social system and the people's government arose in 33 cities and 
seven prefectures and districts in 17 provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities throughout the country and, in 
particular, the situations were more serious in 12 cities and 
three districts in seven provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities, comprising Sichuan Province, Shaanxi Province, 
Shanxi Province, Hubei Province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous 
Region, Liaoning Province, Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xian, 
Taiyuan, Urumqi, Wuhan, Yining, Yanan, Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, 
Yichang, and three districts of the Beijing Municipality. 
  Also disclosed at the conference were many instances of 
snipers firing shots at soldiers and policemen on the outskirts 
of Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu, and Beijing. On the three days of 3, 
8, and 12 May, nine such incidents occurred, causing 11 
casualties and five explosions. 
<H5>  Party Members and Three Types of Persons in the Cultural </H5>
Revolution in "Extremist Organizations" 
  It was also reported that a handful of foreign-invested 
organizations in the mainland had taken part in or were used for 
hostile and illegal activities, including transmitting by 
facsimile instigating and offensive propaganda material to party 
and government departments and making anonymous phone calls to 
carry out activities of interference and sabotage. In a few 
areas, flaunting the banner of defending Marxism-Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought and taking advantage of problems existing and 
arising in the current process of construction and reform, 
underground organizations instigated cadres and the masses to 
slow down their work and go on strike and organized activities 
to overturn existing policies. They made open appeals to party 
members to step forward bravely to "rescue our party" and of 
"down with the old-line capitalist-advocate Deng Xiaoping." 
Party members and three types of persons in the Cultural 
Revolution were in these "extremist organizations. 
  The conference urged party committees and departments 
concerned at all levels to stand fast at their posts, remain 
vigilant, face up to grimmer struggles which may arise, and 
smash and crack down on, without showing any mercy, organized 
sabotage and activities carried out by hostile forces. 
<H5>  Petitions and Protests by Workers and Staff in 19 Cities </H5>
  On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the democratic 
movement in 1989, the whole country is on the highest alert and 
the CPC keeps on arresting dissidents. But in the latter half 
of last April, workers and staff from mines, enterprises, and 
units in 19 cities "illegally" assembled and lodged petitions 
and protests, and marches in which over 1,000 people took part 
broke out in eight cities. 
  The 19 cities were: Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Qiqihar, Anshan, 
Xining, Baoji, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hefei, Taiyuan, Shenyang, 
Lanzhou, Xian, Urumqi, Changsha, Harmi, Zhangjiang, Guiyang, and 
Nanchang. 
  The eight cities in which marches broke out were: Harbin, 
Anshan, Baoji, Urumqi, Nanchang, Xining, Chongqing, and Lanzhou. 
<H5>  Over 5,000 Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Works March in </H5>
the Street 
  In the latter half of last April, over 5,000 workers and 
staff in the iron and steel capital Anshan (most were workers 
and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Works) took 120 cars to march 
around the urban district and shouted such slogans as "workers 
as the masters of the state," "protecting workers' class 
interests," "down with the newborn bourgeoisie," "yes to 
socialism, no to capitalism," and "long live the working class." 
The march went on for more than three hours. 
<H5>  Baoji City Government Is Forced To Accept Workers and </H5>
Staff's Demands 
  In Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, over 2,000 railway, 
engineering, and metallurgical workers and staff assembled and 
held a demonstration in front of the city federation of trade 
unions building to oppose cutting down staff and abolishing 
medical benefits and ask for the granting of education 
allowances to children of workers and staff. Finally, the city 
government was forced to agree that staff would not be reduced 
this year and that all benefits would be kept unchanged. The 
marchers shouted "long live workers' unity" and sang the song 
"Unity Is Strength," and they even bought drinks from shops to 
celebrate. 
  Over 2,000 People Marched in Urumqi 
  Over 1,000 and over 2,000 people assembled and marched in 
Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on 26 and 
28 April respectively. Marchers assembled at the People's Park, 
Nanmen Stadium, and the railway station and then went to the 
People's Square. The autonomous regional party committee and 
the regional government organized nearly 2,000 cadres to 
"dissuade" the marchers from going while stressing that 
"everything can be discussed and solved." However, more than 
800 people still gathered at the People's Square to urge the 
government to protect the working class's interests, curb 
inflation, and crack down on corrupt bureaucrats. Some of the 
marchers even shouted the separatist slogan of "long live 
Xinjiangstan." 
<H5>  A Marching Group of Workers Is Intercepted by Public </H5>
Security Personnel and Armed Policemen in Lanzhou City 
  In Lanzhou City, capital of Gansu Province, over 2,000 
workers and staff from petroleum and chemical plants and woolen 
mills assembled at the Baitashan Park, and then proceeded to the 
provincial government building by car or on foot. Public 
security personnel, armed policemen, unit cadres, and militiamen 
were dispatched by the authorities to intercept the marchers on 
the way. 
<H5>  Enterprise Cadres in Xining Support Workers' Demonstrations </H5>
  In Xining City, capital of Qinghai Province, more than 1,000 
woolen workers and staff went on strike and marched on the 
street. They marched down Dongguan Avenue, Xiguan Avenue, and 
Xinning Road and then assembled in the People's Park. The 
wool-spinning industry is always the key industry of Xining City 
and there are nearly 20 woolen mills with a large scale of 
production. The cost of raw materials has kept on increasing 
year after year. It increased by 230 percent from 1985 to 1992 
and by another 40 percent in 1993, but the selling price only 
increased by 180 percent. In 1994, the higher authorities 
decided to raise the price of woolen material by 62 percent. 
Therefore, 12 major workers' demonstrations have broken out 
since the beginning of this year, and some were supported by 
party and government cadres in the enterprises. 
<H5>  The Authorities Dared Not Rashly Put Down Workers' </H5>
Demonstrations 
  Faced with the turbulent wave of workers' demonstrations 
which had spread to 19 cities in the Northeast, the North, the 
Northwest, the Central South, and the East, the CPC formulated 
and issued the "Decision on Using Weapons While on Patrol and 
Performing Duties" and even promulgated a nationwide alert 
order, yet they dared not rashly use force and there was no 
bloodshed. It seems that the CPC authorities understood that it 
was unwise to resort to high-handed means, so they could only 
beg the "official trade unions" for help. 
<H5>  The CPC Strengthens the Work of the "Official Trade Unions" </H5>
  On 6 May, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee's 
Political Bureau and the CPC Central Committee's Secretariat and 
president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, issued a 
warning at the national work meeting attended by chairmen of 
trade union federations in various provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities throughout the country: We must 
strengthen our party's leadership over trade unions; give play 
to the vanguard role of trade union federations at all levels 
through organization, propaganda, and concrete work; and train 
trade union cadres from among party members and workers and 
staff who have a firm political stand, a mass foundation, and 
considerable prestige and working ability. This is the central 
task of the present organizational work. We must train new 
blood for our party and build up a key force, a contingent of 
veteran and advanced producers, and a contingent of grass-roots 
cadres and militiamen. Wei Jianxing said: We must adopt 
organizational measures to reverse the slackened situation 
existing in trade unions at all levels. Some trade unions have 
become rear-service and welfare departments; some have become 
the mouthpiece for making unreasonable demands on our party and 
our government; and a handful of them are under the control of 
evildoers and have played a part in instigating workers and 
staff to make trouble, go on strike, lodge petitions, or even 
establish illegal organizations and make illegal appointments to 
make rival claims as equals of our party and our government. 
<H5>  Chairmanship of First-Grade Trade Unions Must Be Assumed by </H5>
Members of Party Committee Standing Committees at the Same Levels 
  On the night of 6 May, Jiang Zemin said while meeting with 
leading trade union cadres from all provinces: As far as 
socialist construction and deepening of reform is concerned, the 
working class is always the principal force. To score a victory 
in the cause of socialist construction and revolution, we must 
rely on the working class and give play to the leading role of 
the working class. 
  On 9 May, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat issued a 
circular on "Strengthening the Leadership of Trade Unions at All 
Levels" to party committees at the provincial level. The 
circular stipulated that the chairmanship of first-grade trade 
unions at the provincial, prefectural, and city levels must be 
assumed by members of party committee standing committees or 
deputy secretaries of party committees at the same levels; that 
the chairmanship of trade unions of various large mines, 
enterprises, and units must be concurrently assumed by members 
of party committee standing committees or deputy secretaries of 
party committees; that vice chairmen of trade unions can attend 
meetings of party committee standing committees; and that party 
committee standing committees must place the trade union work at 
the top of the agenda. 
  The matter is very clear. The CPC wants to work through its 
"official trade unions" to control the contingent of workers and 
staff and suppress the workers' movement and the democratic 
movement. But the question is: As the CPC--the "vanguard of 
the working class"--has lost its credibility, what capabilities 
do its official organs still have?

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Feng (0205 7364): "A Serious Incident in </F>
Inner Mongolia--4,000 Cadres Create a Disturbance"] 
  [Text] On 30 April, Li Peng stopped over in Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region for four days after returning home from his 
visit to Central Asia in order to handle an incident--cadres 
from 31 departments and commissions of the autonomous regional 
government planned to travel by train to Beijing on 3 May to 
present a petition. 
  The incident began in early April. Cadres of the party 
committees of the institutions directly subordinate to the 
regional government, the civil affairs department, the 
transportation department, and the cultural department of the 
regional government jointly signed a petition which demanded: 
1) immediate measures to curb inflation; 2) a stop to 
purchasing cars and distributing luxurious houses; 3) immediate 
increases in allowances to grass-roots cadres and retired cadres 
in order to guarantee their living standards; 4) making public 
the investigation and handling of the corrupt officials and 
abusers of power in the party and government leading bodies of 
the autonomous region in order to redress the grievances of the 
general public. The regional party committee and the regional 
government held nine rounds of talks with the representatives of 
the cadres, but the talks achieved no result. On 26 April, the 
regional government issued a three-point statement: 1) The 
petitioning cadres and workers were instigated by some evildoers 
among their representatives to challenge the authority of the 
party committee and the regional government. 2) Some people 
with ulterior motives were trying to create a disturbance in 
order to disrupt the party's central work and harm social 
stability and unity. 3) The autonomous regional government 
would take necessary administrative measures to deal with the 
incident, and might take legal action if necessary. 
  On 27 April, the representatives of cadres and workers from 
a 
number of regional departments met with some leaders of the 
regional government. Then, the general office of the regional 
government issued an ultimatum, demanding that all personnel 
immediately return to their work posts in various departments 
and fulfill their own duties; otherwise, disciplinary action 
would be taken against them. On 28 April, cadres in 23 
departments and commissions resisted the order by means of 
asking for sick leave and making business trips to other places. 
Nearly 800 cadres participated in the petition action in the 
form of a go-slow. Then, cadres in the governments of Baotou 
City, Jining City, and Hailar City also became involved in the 
action. The CPC Central Secretariat and the State Council sent 
Wei Jianxing and Luo Gan to handle the incident in Hohhot on 
behalf of the central authorities. In view of the seriousness 
of the incident, the central authorities and the regional 
authorities organized 15 work teams to go to various regional 
departments, Baotou City, Jining City, and Hailar City. 
  On the evening of 30 April, Li Peng attended a meeting of 
party and government cadres in the autonomous region, and gave a 
five-point instruction: 
  1. The members of the standing committee of the regional 
party committee, the members of the regional party committee, 
and the responsible officials of the regional government should 
go down deeply into various localities and departments to solve 
the urgent problems without delay and explain the government's 
measures. They must overcome the bureaucratic style of work and 
should not coerce their subordinates into submission. 
  2. It is necessary to increase communications between the 
upper authorities and subordinates, between various party and 
government institutions, and between cadres and the masses in 
order to create a relaxed and harmonious atmosphere that is 
beneficial to the party's central work and to the consolidation 
and development of the stable political situation and social 
environment. 
  3. It is necessary to rectify the party organizations in 
order to bring their leading and exemplary role into better play 
and to arouse their initiative in fully implementing the party's 
policies and measures. 
  4. It is necessary to care about the working, living, and 
welfare conditions of cadres. Leading officials and leading 
bodies must not become privileged, and they should always 
subject themselves to supervision by the discipline inspection 
commission, the supervision department, and the people's 
congress at the same level. They must not retaliate against 
other people who criticize them. Subordinates and the masses 
have the right to make complaints, file appeals, lodge 
petitions, and propose the dismissal of incompetent leaders. 
  5. Resolute action should be taken to ban and crack down on 
illegal underground organizations and hostile organizations 
supported by external forces. 
  On 2 and 3 May, Li Peng met with cadres and mass 
representatives from some regional departments. The cadres 
demanded that the leading bodies of the regional party committee 
and the regional government be reorganized, and the secretary of 
the regional party committee be dismissed from office. 
  Reportedly, the central authorities instructed the regional 
authorities of Inner Mongolia to mitigate their contradictions 
with the departmental cadres in order to prevent the 
infiltration of external hostile forces. 
  The incident was characterized by the involvement of cadres 
in various party and government departments at the regional and 
city levels, and such institutions involved in the incident 
numbered more than 120. Over 4,000 cadres participated in the 
petitioning action, more than 3,700 of them being CPC members, 
including some departmental chiefs. This was the first event of 
this nature since the CPC regime was set up. 
  This was also the first protest action to take place in the 
"backyard" of a provincial government. There was a certain 
degree of inevitability. The July issue of TUNG HSIANG [TRENDS] 
in 1992 carried a report about the undercurrents in Inner 
Mongolia. If CPC rule is a combination of Stalin-style fascist 
dictatorship and traditional feudal autocracy, then its rule in 
Inner Mongolia bears a stronger color of Oriental feudal 
autocracy. In the past, Inner Mongolia was always ruled by a 
number of feudal lords, and the Mongolian people never ceased 
their resistance against the rule of the feudal lords. In the 
1920's, Mongolian hero Gadameilin led a popular uprising, and 
his deeds were always on everybody's lips in Inner Mongolia. 
Uranfu, the representative of CPC rule in Inner Mongolia, was 
in fact the greatest feudal lord in the territory; and the 
people there called him a "fiend in human form." He led an 
extravagant and dissipated life, like Kim Il-song in North 
Korea. In Inner Mongolia, Uranfu also pursued the hereditary 
system. In the 1950's, he appointed his son, Buhe, director of 
the regional cultural department and appointed his 
daughter-in-law, Zhulan Qiqi, who played the main part in a film 
in the 1950's, leader of the broadcast, television, and film 
department. The young lord Buhe long since succeeded his father 
as the supreme feudal ruler in Inner Mongolia (he was once 
concurrently secretary of the regional party committee and 
chairman of the regional government). The privileges he enjoyed 
in Inner Mongolia were greater than those of principal leaders 
in any other province. He was greedier and more cruel than any 
lord in history, and was an out-and-out local tyrant. Of the 
four demands of the petitioners, two were related to their 
economic interests (curbing inflation and increasing 
allowances), and the other two were aimed at the privileges of 
local leaders. The targets of the struggle were quite similar 
to those of the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square. 
For example, the petitioners called for stopping the purchase 
of cars and the distribution of luxurious houses, and 
investigating and punishing corrupt officials and power abusers. 
In particular, as the petitioners included a number of 
department chiefs, their struggle was obvious spearheaded 
against leaders at the higher level. They even required Li Peng 
to reorganize the leading bodies of the regional party committee 
and the regional government and to dismiss the secretary of the 
regional party committee. This showed that the flames of fury 
among the people in Inner Mongolia, like their ancestors led by 
Gadameilin, have been burning up to the heads of local tyrant 
Buhe and his clan.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- Today, State Council 
Premier Li Peng presided over the State Council's 20th Executive 
Meeting, which discussed and approved in principle the "PRC Law 
on the People's Bank of China [PBOC] (Draft)" and the "PRC 
Auditing Law (Draft)." 
  The meeting believed that the "PRC Law on the PBOC (Draft)" 
was formulated to define the PBOC's status and functions, ensure 
the scientific and authoritative formulation and implementation 
of monetary policies, strengthen the banking sector's 
supervision and management, and establish and improve the 
central bank's macroeconomic regulation and control system. The 
draft law contains eight chapters that include 46 articles 
covering such areas as the character and status of the PBOC, its 
organization, Renminbi, business operations, supervision and 
management of the banking sector, and business accounting. 
  The meeting believed it is very necessary to formulate the 
"PRC Auditing Law (Draft)" to improve the auditing and 
supervision of state revenues and expenditures and of the 
financial revenues and expenditures related to state-owned 
assets, increase economic returns, maintain China's financial 
and economic order, and guarantee healthy national economic 
development. The draft law contains seven chapters that include 
47 articles covering such areas as the principles of China's 
auditing and supervision system, auditing organs and their 
personnel, auditing organs' duties and functions, limits of 
their authority, auditing procedures, and legal liabilities. 
  After further revisions, the State Council will submit the 
two draft laws approved in principle by the meeting to the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation.

  [Text] While inspecting Hubei 28 May-2 June, Li Lanqing, 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau member and vice premier 
of the State Council, said: Our country is a developing 
country, and it has to run the world's largest educational 
system. It faces a lot of difficulties in this respect. 
Governments at all levels should gradually increase their 
investment in education. However, the fundamental way out is 
through reform. [Video begins with long shots of Li Lanqing 
walking in front of a group of unidentified people in civilian 
clothing] 
  At a discussion meeting with responsible people of 
institutions of higher learning in Wuhan, Li Lanqing pointed 
out: The goals of reforming institutions of higher learning are 
to improve the quality of teaching and our efficiency in running 
the institutions. We should adapt to the needs of the socialist 
market economy, and fully and rationally utilize existing human 
and material resources and facilities. We should not duplicate 
things that are small and all-inclusive but of low quality. We 
should promote many and varied joint efforts to run the 
institutions. The highest form of such joint efforts is the 
merger of various institutions of higher learning. We can also 
use various other forms of joint efforts to run the 
institutions. 
  Li Lanqing also said emphatically: Joint efforts to run 
institutions of higher learning should be conducted step-by-step 
and in a safe and sure manner. We should not promote formalism 
but should stress actual results when conducting such efforts. 
He asked leading party and government comrades to squeeze in 
some time to take a look around schools, talk to people there, 
and brief these people about relevant situations. [Video shows

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- A new white paper about 
women in China was published to enable the world to acquire a 
better understanding of women's conditions in China, a Chinese 
leader said here today. 
  It was also done to promote the development of women all 
over 
the world, said Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and president 
of the All-China Women's Federation. 
  She was answering questions on the white paper entitled 
"Situation of Chinese Women". 
  "The world has become more concerned about conditions of 
Chinese women as the world conference on women will be held in 
Beijing, capital of China, in 1995," she said. 
  Through facts and figures, the white paper reviewed the 
historic liberation of Chinese women in the course of the new 
democratic revolution and the socialist revolution under the 
leadership of the Communist Party of China, as well as their 
status and role under the socialist system. 
  Chen said that the policy of reform and opening to the 
world, 
and the process of building socialist market economy, set a 
higher demand on Chinese women while bringing their intelligence 
into full play. 
  Chen called for women all over China to enhance their 
qualities and to adhere to the slogan of "four selfs" -- 
self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance and 
self-strengthening. 
  She suggested that the government should provide more 
opportunities for women to engage in administering national, 
government and social affairs. 
  On the preparation for the world conference, she said China 
attached great importance to the conference and would do its 
best to ensure its success. 
  She recalled that an organizing committee was set up in 
1992. 
Its 31 constituent bodies include relevant departments of the 
State Council, Beijing municipal government and the press. 
  The conference hall has been fixed and all the preparations 
are under way.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- The national joint 
conference on sample surveying one percent of China's total 
population held its first meeting in Beijing on 2 June. 
  State Councillor Peng Peiyun chaired and spoke at the 
meeting. She stressed: The holding of the meeting indicated 
that the work on sample surveying one percent of China's total 
population in 1995 has begun in an all-around manner. It will 
be another large-scale survey on China's national conditions and 
strength since the fourth national census held in 1990. The 
survey will enable us to further understand changed conditions 
in the quantity, regional distribution, basic composition, and 
housing environment of China's population. It will provide a 
basis for China to form long-term population-control targets and 
to improve responsive measures. It will also provide 
comprehensive and accurate information on China's population for 
China to develop the socialist market economy. In March, the 
State Council General Office distributed the "Circular on Sample 
Surveying One Percent of China's Total Population in 1995" to 
its subordinate organs. We hope governments at various levels, 
particularly localities that are chosen to be surveyed, will pay 
close attention to the survey and strengthen their leadership 
over the work. Various relevant departments should closely 
coordinate with one another and make their greatest efforts to 
properly accomplish the population-surveying task. 
  The survey will be conducted on 12 million people who are 
sampled and chosen from various provinces, autonomous regions, 
and municipalities across China. The survey will mainly collect 
information on the basic conditions, economic activities, 
culture, education, marriages, births, migration, and housing 
conditions of China's population. The on-the-spot survey will 
be carried out in October 1995, and the results' main data will 
be published in January 1996. 
  Attending the meeting were Zhang Sai, director of the State 
Statistical Bureau, and leaders of other relevant ministries and 
commissions.

  [Text] Beijing, June 6 KYODO -- A China Northwest Airlines 
passenger plane with 159 on board crashed in Xian, Shaanxi 
Province, on Monday [5 June] morning with early reports 
indicating that only one passenger survived, officials in Xian 
said. 
  The Russian-built Tupolev-154 plane bound for the southern 
city of Guangzhou crashed some eight minutes after taking off at 
8:20 A.M. Local time, said an official at the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China (CAAC). 
  According to officials from the Xian emergency center, by 
noon some 50 to 60 bodies had been pulled from the wreckage and 
"there was little hope for more survivors." 
  So far one survivor has been found and is in critical 
condition, the official said. Searchers have also identified 
one passenger as a "European." 
  The officials refused to speculate on the cause of the crash 
and said there was no evidence of an explosion. 
  Flight WH 2303 carried 13 crew members and 146 passengers, 
with at least four of the passengers being foreigners, the CAAC 
official said. 
  In 1993, five airplanes crashed in China killing 76 people, 
and eight planes were hijacked. The crash Monday was the first 
in China this year. 
  CAAC replaced its director in January due to the poor safety 
record of China's airline companies. 
  Xian's new airport was built in 1991 and is located some 50 
kilometers northwest of the city, which is a popular tourist 
destination. 
  Japanese Foreign Ministry officials in Tokyo said there were 
apparently no Japanese passengers among the 159 people aboard 
the Chinese Northwest Airlines plane which crashed Monday 
morning in Xian. 
  According to reports reaching the Japanese Embassy in China 
and the Japanese Consulate General in Guangzhou, there were no 
names that appeared to be Japanese on the list of passengers, 
the officials said. 
  But since some Japanese and Chinese names are similar, the 
embassy is still trying to confirm whether there were actually 
no Japanese aboard, they said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Order has been restored 
to a renowned Great Wall tourist spot near Beijing through 
measures taken by the municipal government in the past two 
months. 
  Police said that no extortion or racketeering cases had been 
reported at the Badaling section of the Great Wall, a drive of 
about 90 minutes from the city centre, since the end of April. 
Forced sales had evidently decreased. 
  Since the beginning of the year, the famous tourist site had 
been plagued by cases of forced sales, extortion and 
racketeering. The victims were Chinese and overseas tourists, 
and sometimes even foreign diplomatic personnel could not 
escape, according to police sources. 
  As a result, normal tourist order disappeared, and the 
number 
of visitors to that site declined. 
  Concentrated efforts were made from late April. A team of 
300 people, from police departments, industrial and commercial 
administration departments and city order departments, regularly 
and persistently inspected the area, achieving remarkable 
success. 
  Seven illegal vendors were detained. The stock of four 
stalls near the wall was confiscated and they were banned from 
trading for two months. Confiscated goods and fines totalled 
31,000 yuan. 
  In addition, education courses were given to vendors at the 
site and farmers around the area. 
  Police said they have improved telecommunications and 
transport equipment for the site. Police and industrial and 
commercial departments extended their own daily duty times by an 
hour. 
  The Badaling section of the Great Wall, which in 1991 was 
listed as a world top heritage site by the United Nations, 
stretches along 3.7 km. More than five million tourists visited 
the site last year.

<F P=106> [By Ma Biao (7456 7374) of the Guangxi Provincial Commission </F>
on Economic Restructuring: "Deng Xiaoping's Idea on Building 
Special Economic Zones and His Strategy on Opening Border Areas 
to the Outside World"] 
  I. The Great Significance of Practicing the 
Strategy of Opening Border Areas to the Outside World 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea of building special economic 
zones [SEZs] constitutes an important part of his own theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the 
guidance of his idea, China's SEZs, acting as the country's 
"windows" to the outside world, have played a "vanguard" role in 
reform and opening up, thus giving a tremendous impetus to the 
process of reform and opening up throughout the entire country. 
Through the practice of reform between the 1980's and the early 
90's, a multilevel, multiform, and omnidirectional new setup of 
opening up has taken shape, featuring the pattern of 
SEZs--coastal open cities--coastal open economic zones--inland 
and border areas. This new setup is the outcome, and also a 
concrete embodiment, of Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs in 
practice. Moreover, it is of great significance to our efforts 
to bring a sustained, rapid, and healthy development to China's 
national economy and to fulfill China's second-step strategy on 
building socialist modernization. 
  Along China's 22,000 km border, most regions are inhabited 
by 
ethnic minority nationalities. Practicing the strategy of 
opening border areas to the outside world is the continuance and 
an inevitable outcome of applying in practice Deng Xiaoping's 
idea on building SEZs; it is also an objective requirement for 
us to help ethnic minority regions extricate themselves from 
poverty, narrow the gap between the economically advanced and 
less advanced regions, and bring joint development and common 
prosperity to all nationalities in our country. Practicing the 
strategy of opening up border areas and further expanding border 
trade with neighboring countries is a major change in the 
economic development pattern of China's border areas. It also 
serves as an important way by which China's ethnic minority 
regions can expand their economic and technological exchanges 
and cooperation with other parts of the country and the world, 
allocate major means of production in a more rational way, 
improve their economic performance, enhance their ability to 
compete in international and regional commodity exchanges, and 
bring an overall development to their economy. China's 
accomplishments in both the opening of coastal areas and the 
opening of border areas, which are complementary to each other, 
have added a new chapter to the annals of reform and opening up 
and further enriched Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs. 
  Deng Xiaoping pointed out as early as 1984: "Special zones 
serve as windows for the introduction of technology, management, 
and knowledge; and also as windows for applying our 
foreign-related policies. From special zones, we can introduce 
technology and knowledge from abroad and learn and master 
management skills. Management is also knowledge." (Footnote 1) 
(Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, pp 51-52) 
This celebrated thesis has already been proved correct in the 
pioneering development of SEZs and coastal open areas and can 
thus serve as important guidance for the opening up of border 
areas. The move to turn open border areas into windows for the 
introduction of foreign technology will surely give a tremendous 
impetus to the development of inland and border areas in their 
efforts to establish lateral ties with other domestic areas and 
expand their contacts with foreign countries. The introduction 
of advanced technologies from foreign countries is beneficial to 
transforming existing traditional industries and products, 
developing new technologies and products, improving the 
technical level and the quality of products in enterprises, and 
to building up advantageous and export-oriented industries which 
enjoy a better ability to cooperate with other industries, cope 
with contingencies, and to survive in competition. Moreover, 
through the introduction of foreign advanced technologies, we 
can upgrade the exploration for natural resources and 
comprehensively turn the potential advantages of border ethnic 
regions in natural resources into practical economic advantages; 
push forward the technical progress of border areas; and 
subsequently accelerate the rate of border areas in establishing 
lateral economic and technological ties with other parts of the 
country, thus giving form to a new-type regional economic 
relationship under which border areas, inland areas, and coastal 
areas supplement and help each other on a mutually beneficial 
basis with a view to bringing about joint development and common 
prosperity. Meanwhile, the move to turn open border areas into 
windows for the introduction of management skills can surely 
accelerate and deepen the economic structural reform of inland 
and border areas. In the light of their realistic conditions 
and in accordance with the requirement to establish a socialist 
market economic structure, border areas can learn from and use 
for reference the successful experience of advanced countries in 
managing the socialized general production and in developing the 
market economy with a view to transforming their economic 
structure. The move to turn open border areas into windows for 
introducing knowledge will undoubtedly promote the building of 
the two civilizations in inland and border areas on a 
comprehensive scale. 
  Through these windows, border areas 
can obtain timely information on the latest developments in 
technology, market, capital, and human resources in both 
neighboring countries and the whole world; acquaint themselves 
with the usual economic practices in foreign countries; learn 
and master knowledge about international trade and banking; 
nurture a large number of talents in all fields who are familiar 
with international economic activities; and bring the markets in 
border areas well in line with both the markets in neighboring 
countries and the international market. The move to turn open 
border areas into windows for applying foreign-related policies 
will certainly enable inland and border areas to exert a greater 
influence on their neighboring countries and regions. 
Practicing the policy of opening border areas to the outside 
world is beneficial to: Bringing into better play the 
advantages of border areas in regional development and natural 
resources, thus enabling border areas to have a greater appeal 
to neighboring countries and regions; carrying forward the 
historical tradition of China's border areas to keep contact and 
do business with different nationalities in neighboring 
countries and regions, thus augmenting their friendship with the 
peoples of neighboring countries and promoting the economic and 
technological exchanges and cooperation among them; and 
beneficial to making China's border areas more complementary to 
neighboring countries in terms of industrial structure, product 
mix, and natural resources, thus rejuvenating the border 
economy. As a result, border areas will eventually serve as 
windows to the outside world showing that China has become 
economically stronger and richer and is enjoying a sound social 
order and a general unity among all nationalities. In this way, 
China's influence and status in the international community can 
be enhanced immensely. 
  In short, the strategy of opening border areas to the 
outside 
world is a continuance of Deng Xiaoping's idea on building SEZs 
in the practice of reform and opening up. So long as they 
further use for reference and assimilate the successful 
experiences gained by SEZs and coastal open areas, emancipate 
their minds, make bolder explorations, and open up new paths, 
China's inland and border areas can surely extricate themselves 
from the current economic, technological, and cultural 
backwardness; "gain dominance as newcomers"; and advance both 
the economic development and the living standards of their 
people to a new level. 
<H5>  II. Current Basic Development Trends in China's Open Border </H5>
Areas 
  The current domestic and international political and 
economic 
situations are truly favorable to our efforts to accelerate the 
implementation of the strategy on opening border areas to the 
outside world. Faced with such a rare opportunity to bring a 
comprehensive development to China's inland and border areas, we 
must enhance the sense of urgency in opening up border areas, 
seize this favorable opportunity, and speed up the pace of 
opening border areas to the outside world. 
  To successfully implement the strategy of opening up border 
areas and keep abreast of the basic development trends in border 
areas, we must acquire a correct understanding of the regional 
features, development phases, and trading characteristics of 
China's inland and border areas. There are altogether 143 
border counties (cities) in China's inland and border areas, 
which border on 15 neighboring countries. Alongside the 
in-depth development of China's reform and opening up over 
recent years, the State Council approved in 1984 the 
"Provisional Management Regulations on Small-Volume Border Trade 
Transactions," which was issued by the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Relations and Trade, and decided, in 1992, to list four 
more border cities as open cities, namely, Heihe and Suifenghe 
in Heilongjiang Province, Yunchun in Jilin Province, and 
Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia. After that, a number of border 
cities and counties were opened to the outside world in turn, 
including Pingxiang City and Dongxing Town in Guangxi Province; 
Hekou County, Wanding City, and Ruili County in Yunnan Province; 
Yining City, Tacheng City, and Bole City in Xinjiang; and 
Erenhot City in Inner Mongolia. In addition, preferential 
policies originally designed for coastal open cities were 
applied to a number of provincial (regional) capital cities, 
such as Nanning, Kunming, Urumqi, Huhhot, Changchun, and Harbin. 
This is a major step which China has taken to accelerate the 
pace of reform and opening up and marks the beginning of a new 
development phase for China's drive to open up border areas. 
  At present, China has expanded its border trade with 
neighboring countries in terms of business patterns, levels, and 
scope and the economic cooperation between China and foreign 
countries is being carried out on a more extensive scale. 
China's current border trade with neighboring countries has the 
following special features: The volume of border trade has 
increased by a large margin, of which China enjoys a favorable 
balance of trade while foreign trading parties have adverse 
balances. While the border trade still relies mainly on local 
trade, small-volume transactions, and commodity exchanges among 
border residents, border areas have set out to develop a 
comprehensive exchange and cooperation in the economic, 
technological, and trading fields. 
  While the barter system 
still remains a dominant trading form in border trade, a 
financial market relying mainly on renminbi transactions has 
taken shape, both the labor and tourist markets have 
expereienced fairly large growth, and the border trade is being 
carried out in diversified forms. In the past, the border trade 
mainly took the organizational structure of a nongovernmental 
trade; today, a simultaneous development has been registered in 
both the nongovernmental and official trade, the number of our 
trading partners is increasing on a constant basis, and the 
border trade is developing into a diversified transregional and 
transownership trading system. To promote their economic and 
trade relations with neighboring countries, all border provinces 
and regions have formulated a series of policies, rules, and 
regulations; as a result, the once chaotic border trade is 
moving toward a state of orderliness under the new environment 
of competition. Our neighboring countries, for their part, have 
also adopted a positive attitude in developing their border 
trade with us. They have worked out a series of policies, rules 
and regulations, and measures; and adopted more preferential 
policies, striving for a faster growth in their economies. A 
number of advanced countries in the West, including Japan, 
France, and the United States, as well as countries like 
Thailand and the regions of Hong Kong and Macao have also 
stepped up their efforts to play a bigger role in China's border 
trade with neighboring countries. Meanwhile, advanced areas 
inside the country, such as the coastal areas of Guangdong as 
well as the municipalities of Shanghai and Beijing, have made 
thermselves more involved in border trade. All border areas 
have taken positive measures to preserve their specific regional 
advantages in competition. 
<H5>  III. A Tentative Plan on Implementing the Strategy of </H5>
Opening Border Areas to the Outside World 
  The whole country, central and local authorities alike, has 
reached a consensus on the implementation of the strategy of 
opening up border areas. All provinces and autonomous regions 
along the border have also worked out their own policies and 
regulations guiding the development of the border trade. 
However, judging by the overall situation, an overall plan on 
how the strategy can be implemented remains to be formulated. 
Therefore, it has become a pressing matter of the moment to 
adapt ourselves to the objective needs of the new situation 
resulting from the opening of border areas and establish China's 
strategy of opening border areas to the outside world. The 
strategy of opening up border areas should embrace a guiding 
ideology, a strategic principle, major tasks, a strategic 
set-up, and key policies and measures. 
  The guiding ideology for the opening of border areas is as 
follows: In the light of the realistic conditions of China's 
inland and border areas, and in accordance with the requirements 
set out in the country's macroeconomic policies, we must make 
use of the current relaxed international political situation; 
vigorously bring into better play the geographical, resources, 
and economic complementary advantages of border areas; carry out 
the strategy of opening up border areas which aims at 
rejuvenating them and making their people rich; actively help 
border areas step up their economic, trade, and technological 
cooperation with neighboring countries; use opening up to 
promote reform and economic development; enhance the overall 
economic strength of border areas with a final aim of developing 
the productive forces; bring about a comprehensive development 
to the scientific and technological, cultural, and educational 
undertakings in border areas; strengthen border security and 
promote unity among all nationalities; and we must fulfill the 
second-step strategic goal of our modernization drive and bring 
about common progress and prosperity for all nationalities. 
  It is the strategic principle of the opening of border areas 
to regard the border trade as a breakthrough point, use trade as 
a guide, rely mainly on inland areas, focus our attention on 
economic and technological cooperation as well as on the markets 
of neighboring countries, and open up more international 
markets. To fulfill the goal of rejuvenating border areas and 
making their people rich, we will open border areas to the 
outside world in a comprehensive way; introduce foreign 
equipment, technology, and capital while establishing lateral 
ties with domestic enterprises; and bring about a regional 
association and integration between the eastern and western 
parts of the country, with a view to bringing about a 
comprehensive development. 
  The major tasks of the opening of border areas should 
include 
the following: We should readjust and optimize the industrial 
structure and the product mix in border areas; set up more 
production bases for exported commodities, and help border areas 
develop their own highly competitive products for exports; 
expand the commodity, technology, and equipment exports from 
border areas; promote their exports of labor services; actively 
introduce from abroad scarce resources, supplies, and raw and 
semi-finished materials; improve the environment for investment; 
accelerate the market building and perfect the market system; 
and change the functions and roles of governments in border 
areas. 
  The strategic set-up for the opening of border areas 
requires us to further consolidate and perfect the opening belts 
along the southwest, northwest, and northeast borders, thus 
turning them into regional economic opening belts with their own 
specific features. While further strengthening and improving 
inland ports already approved by the central authorities, we 
must build up a number of new inland ports in selected locations 
in a planned way and enhance their fanning influence, giving 
shape to a new opening set-up under which the experience of 
selected units will be used to promote the work of the whole. 
  The key policies and measures guiding the opening of border 
areas should embrace the following: First, more preferential 
policies should be adopted. For example, we can set up 
processing zones for the export trade from inland and border 
areas, allow these zones to enjoy the preferential treatment 
originally designed for SEZs, and grant them greater 
decisionmaking powers as well as preferential policies in 
operation. Second, we need to further readjust the industrial 
structure and the product mix in border areas. Third, efforts 
should be taken, through various channels, to promote 
comprehensive exchanges and cooperation with neighboring 
countries in the fields of economy, technology, trade, and labor 
services. Fourth, advances need to be made to further change the 
operational mechanisms of state-owned enterprises in border 
areas and turn them into market-oriented enterprises. Moreover, 
we need to make rational readjustments to the organizational 
structure of medium and small enterprises, vigorously promote 
the nonstate-owned economies, and accelerate the development of 
township and town enterprises in border areas. Fifth, further 
efforts should be made to perfect the market system in border 
areas. Sixth, we must continue to reinforce and promote the 
lateral economic cooperative relations between the eastern and 
western parts of the country and further develop the economic 
and technological cooperation in border areas with both inland 
and coastal areas. Seventh, in line with the requirements to 
establish a socialist market economic structure and to open 
border areas to the outside world, we should actively explore 
ways to reform the investment, financial, banking, planning, 
circulation, and foreign trade structures in border areas. 
  Opening border areas to the outside world is the continuance 
and development of Deng Xiaoping's ideas on building SEZs in the 
practice of reform and opening up. Our current efforts to 
expedite the opening up of border area will undoubtedly turn the 
economy of China's inland and border areas into a new force in 
China's economic development in the 1990's.

<F P=106> [Article by Shi Zhongquan (4258 0112 3123): "Great Radiance </F>
of Marxism in China Today"] 
  [Text] Abstract: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism for 
today's China. The most fundamental aspect of this theory is the 
answer it has provided to the question of what socialism is and 
how to build socialism in the present historical context. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is an important development of the basic 
theory of Marxism. This development mainly finds expression in 
the following aspects: 1) the theory of initial stage of 
socialism; 2) the theory of developing and emancipating the 
productive forces and the "three-beneficial" criteria with "the 
criterion of productive forces" at the core; 3) the theory of 
planned commodity economy of socialism and socialist market 
economy; and 4) the theory on the nature of socialism. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has steadfast faith in socialism and 
puts all his mind on the socialist cause. He has put forward 
many new ideas for the purpose of better adhering to Marxism and 
adhering to the socialist orientation, emphasizing adherence to 
the socialist orientation not just in terms of the primal system 
but also in all his reform, opening up, and modernization 
policies. 
  The 14th CPC National Congress highly appraised Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as "the latest achievement in the integration of 
Marxism with China's reality and the Marxism in today's China." 
The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
as a historical record of the full-scale reform and opening up 
of our country and the enormous changes in the process of 
socialist modernization, actually reflects the process of 
founding, enriching, perfecting, and developing this Marxist 
theory of today's China based on the reform, opening up, and 
modernization. Understanding a great ideological theory often 
takes time. As we carry on studying the third volume of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in greater depth, we 
will be able to perceive ever more keenly the great radiance of 
this Marxist theory in today's China. [end abstract] 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  It has been nearly 80 years since scientific socialism 
evolved from theory to practice. In our country, it has been 
almost 40 years since the socialist system was established. 
Over the past decades, the orientation of our building 
socialism has been perfectly correct [wan quan zheng que 1346 
0356 2973 4292] and we have made great achievements and changed 
China's face. However, quite a number of errors have also been 
made and we have encountered setbacks and tribulations. The 
reasons are many. In a theoretical sense, a fundamental reason 
is the failure to be completely aware of or clear about the 
basic question of what Marxism is, what socialism is, and how to 
build socialism. 
  We are communists and have practiced socialism for many 
years 
and yet we have not clearly understood the question of what 
socialism is and how to build socialism. This seems hard to 
understand when one first hears it but, on thinking it over, one 
realizes that as far as our country is concerned, this is the 
very crux of the matter. Taking class struggle as the key link 
and failure to shift the focus of the party's work to 
energetically developing the productive forces over a long 
period of time made it impossible to put an end to the poverty 
in the people's livelihood. Can one say we had a clear 
understanding of this issue? Pursuing some economic and other 
policies over a long period of time beyond what was feasible in 
the respective historical phases restricted, and even seriously 
dampened, the enthusiasm in production of the broad masses of 
workers. Can one say we had a clear understanding of this 
issue? Obviously, our socialist practice in the past carried a 
certain subjectivity, one-sidedness, and blindness to a large 
extent. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "Today, though 
we are practicing socialism, in fact we are not up to it yet." 
  The argument that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism in today's 
China can be proven from many angles. However, the most 
fundamental point is that he answered the question of what 
socialism is and how to build socialism in today's historical 
context. What is today's historical context? Since the 1970's, 
the historical context of this phase at least has the following 
three distinct features: First, peace and development have 
become the theme of our times. To boost the economy and improve 
livelihood has become the common aspiration of all peoples. 
Second, the scientific and technological revolution worldwide 
is moving ahead at lightning speed. The economy of some 
developed countries continues to prosper, further widening the 
"south-north" gap and putting some underdeveloped countries in a 
more disadvantageous position. Third, the rapid rise of the 
economy of some burgeoning industrialized nations and regions 
surrounding China has brought not only a rare opportunity but 
also a grim challenge and pressure on China in its development. 
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, while summing up our country's experience of 
successes and setbacks in practicing socialism and drawing on 
the ups and downs, successes and failures which other countries 
had experienced in practicing socialism, Comrade Xiaoping never 
stopped seeking to understand and solve the question of how to 
build socialism by referring to this new historical context. 
Pursuing the policy of reform and opening up was to find a 
correct answer to this question through practice. The putting 
forward of the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics was to take a further step in answering this 
question from a theoretical approach. 
  By studying the volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, one can easily see that in the process of 
developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characters, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the following five 
unequivocal points while treating the misunderstandings on the 
issue of understanding and building socialism: 1) poverty is 
not socialism and excessively slow development is not socialism 
either; 2) egalitarianism is not socialism and neither is 
polarization; 3) socialism cannot be developed with rigidity and 
self-closure, nor can it be developed by copying other countries 
indiscriminately; 4) no democracy, no socialism; no legal 
system, no socialism; and 5) socialism cannot be successful 
without due attention to both material and spiritual 
civilization. These five aspects were Comrade Xiaoping's 
rethink about "what socialism is" from the perspective of 
integrating theory with practice. They clarified the 
distinction between scientific socialism and various distorted 
forms of socialism. By clarifying what socialism "is not," he 
actually answered the question of "what it is." Comrade 
Xiaoping is not a "book worshipper" and has never studied 
problems using a scholastic approach. Instead, he has always 
grasped the core of an issue by closely integrating it with 
reality. He has repeatedly emphasized: The Marxism we must 
adhere to "must be the Marxism which integrates with China's 
reality"; the socialism we must adhere to "must be the socialism 
with Chinese characteristics which fits in with China's 
reality." This understanding of socialism is in line with the 
world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and is 
a flexible application of the Marxist, scientific ideological 
line. This correct understanding of socialism standardized the 
path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in all 
dimensions. The 13th CPC National Congress in 1987 summed up 
the experience in building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and made a macrosummary of the theory, thus 
further clarifying this issue. Therefore, when meeting with 
foreign guests in May 1988, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Our 
mind used to be full of do's and don'ts but we have now broken 
out of them" and "it is not until now that we have solved the 
question of what socialism is." 
  Solving here means finding a "new road" and "putting forward 
a series of new principles and policies." As Comrade Xiaoping 
put it, its "focal point is to shift from taking class struggle 
as the key link to centering round developing productive forces, 
from closure to opening up, and from sticking to the old ways to 
carrying out reforms in various fields." According to this idea 
and on the basis of Comrade Xiaoping's talks on his inspection 
tour of southern China in 1992, the 14th CPC National Congress 
made a new summary of this theoretical system, clearly putting 
forward the new concept of "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics" and made an 
appeal for "equipping the whole party" with this theory, thus 
upgrading the understanding partywide of this new theory which 
was considered "Marxism for today's China." 
<H5>  II. </H5>
  As "Marxism for today's China," Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has a 
very rich content. Looking upon it as both Marxist and Chinese, 
both socialist and contemporary, we can find the following 
especially important aspects in which it is a development of 
basic Marxist theory. 
  1. The theory of the initial stage of socialism. 
  This was a great creation made by the second-generation 
central leadership collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the 
core and is of great significance both in theory and in 
practice. First, this theory is a profound analysis of the 
national conditions of our country. It confirmed that to build 
socialism in a context of backward productive forces and an 
underdeveloped commodity economy, it is imperative to first 
accomplish the task of industrialization and of the 
commercialization, socialization, and modernization of 
production. Thereupon, it clarified the the starting point in 
formulating the party's line, principle, and policy and laid the 
first theoretical cornerstone for the establishment of the 
theoretical system of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Second, highlighting the initial stage of 
socialism, considered quite a lengthy period, in the entire 
history of socialism helped us improve our understanding of the 
protracted and arduous nature of building socialism and overcome 
the "left"-leaning impetuosity transcending the confines of each 
historical phase which we had failed to overcome for decades. 
Third, the theory of the initial stage of socialism is the 
theoretical basis of the theory that the party's basic line 
should be upheld unswervingly for 100 years. It takes at least 
100 years to basically realize socialist modernization and 
achieve the level of medium-developed countries. All this 
period belongs to the initial stage of socialism. The party's 
basic line is the basic line that takes care of the entire 
initial stage and ensures the fulfillment of this goal. To 
achieve this goal, the party's basic line must not be shaken. 
Lastly, the theory of the initial stage of socialism has opened 
up a new approach to building socialism for underdeveloped 
countries. The specific national conditions of our country 
determined that China could not directly conduct a socialist 
revolution and that China's revolution must be carried out in 
two phases; in the same way, they determined that after its 
revolution succeeded, China could not directly copy the 
formulation for building socialism in developed countries 
conceived by Marx and Engels but must first go through an 
initial stage of socialism. If the theory of new democracy 
provided a model for the convergence between democratic 
revolution and socialist revolution in underdeveloped countries, 
the theory of the initial stage of socialism has provided 
another approach to the convergence between the socialist 
construction of an underdeveloped country and the socialist 
construction in the developed phase. 
  2. The theory of developing productive forces, 
emancipating productive forces, and the "three-beneficial" 
criteria with the "criterion of productive forces" at the core. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics first of all confirms the idea that the 
fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces 
and lays special emphasis on their development. If finding an 
answer to the question of what socialism is and how to build 
socialism is the theme of the three volumes of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the main answer to 
this theme, namely, emphasizing the need to concentrate energies 
on the development of productive forces and that "socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is the socialism that continuously 
develops social productive forces," is a main line running 
through all three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping. He used this idea to answer every question he 
raised about what socialism is. He emphasized that "development 
is the last word" and that we must rid ourselves of all 
interference and strive to boost economic construction even if 
it means we will have to toughen our scalp [ying zhe tou pi 4289 
4192 7333 4122]; this is our overriding concern and "everything 
has to give way to this overriding concern." He also suggested 
that "the most important principle of socialism is to develop 
production" and emphasized that the basic line of the party is 
to "center round economic construction." 
  That "reform is also the emancipation of the productive 
forces" is another new viewpoint in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
There was no mention in Marxist and Leninist books regarding 
whether or not the issue of emancipating the productive forces 
would remain after the establishment of the socialist system; 
and neither was any answer given to this question in Mao 
Zedong's works. Through his rethink on the socialist practice, 
Comrade Xiaoping believed that it does not fit in with the 
context of a socialist country to only talk about developing the 
productive forces without mentioning the need to emancipate the 
productive forces through reform. Generally speaking, the basic 
contradictions of a socialist society, production relations 
versus productive forces and superstructure versus economic 
base, which are two aspects of the unity of opposites, basically 
conform with each other. However, under special circumstances, 
the two sides can also experience sharp conflict. For example, 
the old system may seriously restrict the development of the 
productive forces and wrong lines and policies may cause 
repeated setbacks to economic construction. Therefore, Comrade 
Xiaoping suggested emancipating the productive forces through 
reform and that "we should be inclusive when talking about 
emancipating the productive forces and developing them. Here, 
"being inclusive" means that the socialist system in our country 
actually shoulders the dual task of developing the productive 
forces and emancipating them. This further deepened our 
understanding of the movement of the basic contradictions of 
socialism and developed the socialism theory of Marxism, 
Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. 
  The "criterion of productive forces" is a Marxist concept 
with a well defined meaning put forward by the 13th CPC National 
Congress. In his talks made during his inspection tour of 
southern China, Comrade Xiaoping developed the theory of the 
"criterion of the productive forces" into the theory of the 
"three benefits" criteria. We consider it a development for the 
following reasons: First, it not only upholds the theory of the 
"criterion of productive forces," (being the most important of 
the "three benefits"), but also makes more concrete and 
practical the abstract theoretical form of the theory on the 
"criterion of productive forces." The second and third 
"benefits" are the extension, supplement, and specification of 
the first "benefit." Second, in terms of epistemology, the 
theory of the "three-benefit" criteria is more comprehensive. 
As productive forces develop and the overall national strength 
increases, does it mean the people's living standards will 
definitely improve accordingly? The dramatic changes in some 
socialist countries indicate that the answer is no. 
Theoretically, they should go hand in hand but, in practice, 
there is often a contrast [fan cha 0646 1567]. In view of such 
historical lessons, proposing the theory of the "three-benefit" 
criteria will be more conducive to the consolidation and 
development of the socialist system. Third, it embodies an 
understanding of the principal social contradiction in our 
country at present more clearly and integrates the criterion of 
productive forces with the criterion of people's interests. At 
present, the principal social contradiction of our country is 
that between the ever growing demand of the people for materials 
and culture and backward social production. The way it is 
written, the theory of "three-benefit" criteria not only 
highlights the fundamental task of putting development of the 
productive forces in the first place but also emphasizes the 
need to implement it at the basic point of improving people's 
living standards. In other words, it puts whether or not 
something is conducive to improving people's living standards 
together with whether or not it is conducive to developing the 
productive forces, making it a criterion for measuring the 
correctness and performance of the party's work. This is the 
integration of the criterion of productive forces with the 
criterion of people's interests. In practice, it is more 
conducive to reflecting the party's aim of serving the people 
wholeheartedly and the socialist nature of our country which 
puts the people's interests first. 
  3. Theory on socialist planned commodity economy and 
socialist market economy. 
  These were epoch-making breakthroughs in the traditional 
socialist economic theory and can also be considered two 
revolutionary structures [jian gou 1696 2845] of Marxist 
political economy by the second-generation central leadership 
collective with Comrade Xiaoping at the core. As far as the 
social-economic form is concerned, for a long time, it was 
believed that socialism was a society of product economy and its 
management system follows that of the planned economy. From 
Lenin to Mao Zedong, though this opinion was changed somewhat in 
theory and practice, there was no thorough breakthrough. The 
reform and opening up since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee has been "an earth-shaking cause, a 
great experiment, a revolution." As a summary of the experience 
of the great revolutionary practice, the "Decision By the CPC 
Central Committee on the Reform of the Economic Structure," made 
by our party in October 1984, put forward the formulation that 
the socialist economy "is a planned commodity economy on the 
basis of public ownership." For the first time, it admitted 
that the commodity economy is an intrinsic, innate, and 
essential requirement for socialist economic development and 
laid a theoretical foundation for making a series of major 
economic policies in China's overall reform and opening up. 
With the surging tide of reform and opening up, the conflict 
between planning and market in the system and the mechanism of 
economic management has become progressively intense. While 
equating the planned economy with socialism, long-standing 
traditional values also mixed up the market economy with 
capitalism. It has been very difficult to change this fixed 
concept. Comrade Xiaoping has made a dozen speeches since 1979, 
repeatedly pointing out: "There is no fundamental contradiction 
between socialism and the market economy," that socialism can 
also practice the market economy, that "productive forces can be 
better emancipated" by integrating planning with the market, and 
that "it is untrue that practicing a bit of the market economy 
means following the capitalist road." In his talks during his 
inspection tour of southern China in 1992, he once again pointed 
out that planning and market "are both economic means" and "not 
an essential distinction between socialism and capitalism." 
Later, through the 14th CCPC National Ccongress, our party 
officially established the theory of the "socialist market 
economy." The "Decision By the CPC Central Committee on Certain 
Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, further enriched and developed this 
theory. The founding of the theory of socialist planned 
commodity economy and the theory of socialist market economy are 
the "latest achievements" in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a product of 
the integration of Marxism with China's reality. They are the 
chief markers of his theory reaching the height of Marxism. 
  4. The theory on the nature of socialism. 
  This was a new viewpoint presented by Comrade Xiaoping 
during 
his southern China tour. How should we look at the theory of 
"the nature of socialism," this new summing-up definition? In 
my opinion, this new definition, compared with all previous 
definitions, has at least the following four merits: First, it 
highlights the object of the effort to dispel chaos and restore 
order. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Concentrating energies 
on the development of the productive forces on the basis of 
adhering to the four cardinal principles" is the "most 
fundamental effort to dispel chaos and restore order." It is 
obviously in view of the grave historical lessons that the 
theory on "the nature of socialism" emphasizes the need to 
develop the productive forces. Second, it highlights creativity 
which contains new ideas. Comrade Xiaoping believes that it was 
incomplete to talk about developing the productive forces in the 
context of socialism in the past without talking about 
emancipating the productive forces through reform; we should 
talk about both emancipating and developing the productive 
forces. Summing up the two tasks of socialism, namely, 
emancipating the productive forces and developing them, the 
nature of socialism not only underlines the role of the 
productive forces issue but also underlines the significance of 
reform. Third, it highlights the dynamic nature of socialist 
development and the gradual fulfillment of the nature of 
socialism. Socialism is a very long historical phase, divided 
into the initial stage and other stages, and is in a constant 
state of change and reform. Fulfilling the nature of socialism 
is a historical process. It cannot be achieved soon after the 
socialist system is established, nor can the deadline be 
categorically set for the conclusion of the initial stage of 
socialism. "Eventually reaching common prosperity" embodies 
this historical feature. This is conducive to overcoming the 
long-standing tendency toward "egalitarianism" and stabilizing 
the party's current basic policies while preventing 
polarization. Fourth, it highlights the ultimate goal in 
pursuing and developing socialism. Volume three of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping contains many 
expositions on the goal of socialist construction. The ideas 
are clearly presented and are mainly concerned with "developing 
production" and "common prosperity," culminating in the 
conclusion that developing production also has the purpose of 
eventually achieving common prosperity. The theory on "the 
nature of socialism," this new summing-up definition, fully 
reflects this ultimate goal. 
  III. 
  As the Marxism for contemporary China, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is certainly "Marxist" and "socialist." Comrade 
Xiaoping has firm faith in Marxism and spares no effort either 
of thought or action in the socialist cause. A thorough 
understanding of volume three of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping can easily make us see that many of his new 
thoughts are aimed at upholding Marxism and socialism in a 
better way. There are enormous elaborations on this point, the 
following few of which are particularly outstanding: 
  1. The emphasis that Marxism is a scientific theory 
--"We cannot desert our theoretical lineage!" 
  Comrade Xiaoping has a profound understanding of Marxism and 
an uncanny power to grasp and use it. Whenever he asks, and 
answers, what socialism and Marxism are, he starts from the 
basic tenets and spells out briefly, precisely, accurately, and 
plainly the theoretical foundation for the series of reform and 
opening up policies. He said on his southern inspection tour: 
"We have been talking about Marxism all our lives. Marxism, in 
fact, is not at all esoteric. It is quite down-to-earth and 
simple." 
  Comrade Xiaoping lays much emphasis on the fact that his 
thought has only inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought. In August 1991, he told some central 
comrades-in-charge: "We have not dropped Marx, Lenin, nor Mao 
Zedong in pursuing reform and opening up and focusing our work 
on economic construction." He firmly opposes the alleged 
opposition between his thought and theory and 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. When American reporter 
Mike Wallace asked about this, he pointed out explicitly: "I am 
a Marxist and I have always followed basic Marxist principles" 
and while his thought "differs in some aspects from Mao Zedong's 
concepts, the two share certain principles." This explains the 
relationship between Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and Marxism but not 
between his theory and Mao Zedong's, which is more complicated. 
Here we need to make two distinctions. One, following the 
"Resolutions on Certain Problems in Party History Since the 
Founding of the Nation" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, we separated Mao Zedong Thought 
from his mistakes in his later years. Mao Zedong Thought refers 
specifically to the theories and principles proved correct by 
practice and excludes his mistakes in his old age. Two, we 
distinguish between basic theoretical principles and certain 
specific policies or concepts. What Comrade Xiaoping describes 
as "some difference" between his and Mao Zedong's ideas refers 
mainly to the difference between his ideas and Mao Zedong's 
erroneous thoughts and some of his individual policies in his 
old age. Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics was founded on the negation of Mao 
Zedong's mistakes in his old age. Moreover, even if they were 
both right in policies or ideas in a given circumstance, 
different historical conditions and different social exposure, 
cultural characters, and intellectual perspectives between the 
two would have resulted in different options taken -- hence the 
"difference." However, this is not the main thing. When 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is compared with the basic principles of 
Mao Zedong Thought, we find that "the two are identical [yi yang 
0001 2876] after all" and proceed along the same lines. There 
are obvious common points and continuity between the two in the 
general line of thinking (both affirm combining the general 
principles of Marxism with China's specific realities), 
theoretical character (both stress choosing one's own path, 
opposing blind faith in the canon, and upholding Chinese 
characteristics), theoretical approaches (seeking truth from 
facts, case analysis for individual cases, and so on), and 
theoretical content (compare certain viewpoints under the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with related 
viewpoints in Mao Zedong Thought). Of course, we cannot simply 
identify one with the other, holding that Mao Zedong Thought 
already contains the view of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. This does not accord with reality and is 
another kind of partiality. As explained above, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's building socialism with Chinese characteristics is 
grand theory; we can even say that it took Mao Zedong Thought to 
a new dimension. A new stage in historical development 
necessarily demands a parallel new phase in theoretical 
development. Once we recognize that the historical development 
following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee had moved to a new stage, the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as a scientific summation 
of historical experience must necessarily develop Mao Zedong 
Thought and take it to a new stage. 
  2. The emphasis that socialism is a good system; and 
the pursuit of reform and opening up is aimed at consolidating 
and developing socialism. 
  For some, the question whether or not China should choose 
the 
capitalist or socialist road has never been properly solved. 
This, coupled with confusing propaganda by overseas hostile 
forces, has enabled a few to cherish the hope of edging China 
toward capitalism. Comrade Xiaoping's attitude toward this is 
very clear: He remains firm throughout in criticizing this 
mistaken tendency and has explained from varied angles and 
perspectives, why China cannot pursue capitalism and why only 
socialism can save and develop China. His analysis is based on 
modern Chinese history and a comparison between the two systems 
and he approaches the issue in a global context, explaining it 
in terms of peace and development for mankind. He points out: 
China's pursuit of socialism is also a key issue for the world; 
"if a 1-billion-strong China took the capitalist road it would 
be a disaster for the world"; China shows its sense of 
responsibility for one-fifth of humanity and "might make greater 
contributions to mankind" in opting for a socialist path. 
  Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics upholds socialism not only in matters 
concerning fundamental structures but also in all the policies 
on reform, opening up, and modernization. Comrade Xiaoping has 
pointed out repeatedly: "The four modernizations we pursue are 
socialist in nature because only socialism is cohesive enough"; 
"the enlivening of the domestic economy and opening up to the 
outside world we are talking about develop under the principle 
of socialism"; "the absorption of certain good elements from the 
capitalist society is done to complement the development of a 
socialist society." This is why he has been consistently tough 
on bourgeois liberalization. He believes that "bourgeois 
liberalization" is a political concept with a definite meaning 
which is identical to "taking the capitalist road." Any 
tendency which dilutes or blurs the political content of this 
concept is harmful. This helps us understand why, during the 
entire process of reform and opening up, he, as he put it 
himself, "has talked most of the time about opposing bourgeois 
liberalization and I have been firmest about it" and "on this I 
have never yielded." 
  3. The emphasis that it takes the unceasing and 
unyielding effort of several or even dozens of generations to 
achieve long-term peace and stability in Chinese society. 
  Socialism in China is a hard-won achievement. What must we 
do to consolidate and develop the present status and achieve the 
heroic objective of catching up with medium-developed countries 
in per capita GNP by the mid-21st century? This has been a key 
problem long on the mind of Comrade Xiaoping. He has been 
occupied above all by two issues: One, keeping the party's 
basic line and policies unchanged for a long time and two, 
grooming and selecting successors from whom to form a good 
central collective leadership. With these two problems solved, 
"China will be as steady as a mountain" and "socialist China 
will be unconquerable." 
  The problem of keeping the party's basic line and basic 
policies unchanged for a long time is a theme running through 
volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and 
is expounded and explained scores of times in the book. This 
shows that this thinking of his has taken a long time to mature 
and is highly consistent. More striking is the fact that, after 
the 1989 political turmoil, he not only did not "change course 
nor what he advocated" but dwelt on the subject even more 
frequently, showing the extraordinary firmness of his thinking. 
On his southern inspection tour he stressed that "the basic 
line must be kept unchanged and is untouchable for the next 100 
years." Whoever wants to change this line "will be struck 
down." Given the consistency and firmness of his thinking, this 
emphasis of his is a logical necessity. In May and September 
1989, he talked about "the political assignment" to the party. 
Keeping the party's basic line and basic policies unchanged for 
the next 100 years is the most important political assignment he 
has given to the whole party and people of the whole country, 
  Comrade Xiaoping also talked a great deal about selecting, 
promoting, and grooming successors, because the political task 
of keeping the party's basic line and policies unchanged for a 
long time requires organizational guarantees, specifically in 
the form of the passing of leadership from cadres of the older 
generation to younger cadres. He said on his southern 
inspection tour: "In a certain sense, the key to a sound 
pursuit of Chinese affairs, a sustained effort at socialism, 
reform, and opening up; speedier economic development, and 
long-term peace and stability for the country, lies in the 
personnel." "Personnel are what we have to rely on when we talk 
about keeping the party's basic line in command for the next 100 
years and long-term peace and stability. What really determines 
the whole situation is personnel." This is something we cannot 
just take light-heartedly. He also said: "If ever there is a 
problem with China, it will most probably come from the party." 
How profound this observation was! When this problem is 
solved, and when generations of leaders can be selected, 
promoted, and groomed through a relatively perfect system and 
mechanism, who can guide various tasks with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in a comprehensive and accurate fashion, uphold 
the party's basic line and policies comprehensively and 
correctly and keep them unchanged, remain firm throughout in 
upholding the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people, 
work for the benefit of the people in a down-to-earth and 
sustained fashion, the broad masses of the people, who are 
masters of the historical fate of this country, will certainly 
feel that "after all, socialism and reform and opening up are 
good and that our cause will remain relevant forever!" 
  As the Marxism for contemporary China, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a theoretical system with an open structure. 
As explained above, its greatness lies in its ability to anchor 
socialism in the contemporary world and make it more open, more 
receptive to all the civilized achievements of human society, 
including absorbing and digesting all advanced knowledge and 
skills embodying the laws of modern and socialized production in 
contemporary capitalist countries, turning them into nutrients 
for socialism, hence endowing the embattled world's socialist 
cause with new vitality and a bright future. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a brilliant paradigm of how Marxism can be 
integrated with China's practical conditions and socialism with 
contemporary realities. Of course, it has not, and cannot, 
ended the search for an understanding of how China constructs, 
consolidates, and develops socialism. The theory will be 
continuously enriched, perfected, and developed in the process 
of studying new situations, solving new problems, and being 
verified by practice. This is precisely its brilliance and 
greatness.

<F P=106> [Article by Hsia Wen-szu (1115 2429 1835): "Beijing's </F>
Political Situation Is Critical and Unpredictable"] 
  [Text] A reformist economist recently commented on 
Beijing's political situation, and shook his head. He only 
uttered four characters in conclusion: "Full of unpredictable 
crises and dangers." 
  He said: The current political situation is extremely 
complicated. Various signs show that Deng Xiaoping is no longer 
able to control the overall situation. Since the end of last 
year, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji have held the power in their 
hands and have been going their own ways. They even wantonly 
changed Deng's policies. Some conservatives also acted more 
flagrantly, and even tried to totally overthrow the reform line 
set forth by Deng in the past more than 10 years. 
  In an article about Beijing's situation I wrote in April, I 
quoted an authoritative source saying that Deng Xiaoping could 
not say anything when meeting Shanghai leaders at the last 
Spring Festival. The remarks quoted by the newspapers were all 
uttered by his daughter. Moreover, Deng Xiaoping had not given 
any policy instruction in the past few months. The remarks by 
Deng being spread outside the mainland might all be cooked up by 
Deng's family members and Deng's personal office. 
  The information was recently reconfirmed by another Beijing 
source, who told this author that Deng Xiaoping always stayed at 
home in Beijing and had become completely senile. He could only 
utter some indistinct murmurs and could not say even a complete 
sentence. What he wanted to say was completed and expressed by 
his daughter Deng Rong, and Deng was also rather confused and 
muddle-headed. 
  The source said that as Deng's health was getting worse, he 
was no longer able to concern himself about any political 
affairs. In September last year, the mainland newspapers 
suddenly made public some of Deng's remarks, and stressed 
"development is the last word." This reflected Deng's discontent 
with Zhu Rongji's macroeconomic control. In fact, the remark 
was created by Deng Rong and the Deng Xiaoping Office, who tried 
to issue the paramount order in the name of Deng Xiaoping. 
However, Deng Rong's action could only play a temporary role. 
After Deng Xiaoping appeared on television during the Spring 
Festival this year, Jiang Zemin and other leaders no longer gave 
any consideration to his existence. 
  The source said that political circles in Beijing generally 
agreed that Deng Xiaoping was already a living dead man, and the 
political situation would not be affected by his existence or 
nonexistence. 
  The fact that showed Deng Xiaoping's inability to control 
the 
political situation was that de-Dengism had appeared in Beijing. 
  At the national propaganda work conference last January, 
Jiang Z emin suddenly again mentioned the subject of "peaceful 
evolution," which became taboo after Deng's inspection tour of 
the south in 1992, and talked a lot about criticizing bourgeois 
liberalization. After that, a number of leaders in Beijing also 
talked about the issue of "peaceful evolution." 
  Moreover, the CPC authorities also gave a new interpretation 
to Deng's opinion on guarding against and opposing Leftism. Not 
long ago, an instruction of the Central Propaganda Department 
was issued to the press institutions in Beijing, saying that 
Deng Xiaoping's opinion on guarding against Leftism mainly 
referred to things in the economic field rather than in the 
political and ideological field. In the political and 
ideological field, there should not be anti-Leftism. 
  Some people in political circles in Beijing said that Lu 
Ping's remark that Hong Kong cannot become a political city was 
a new interpretation by the CPC authorities of the "one country, 
two systems" principle. If "one country, two systems" is 
applied to the political field, that will mean that China will 
give up the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  In fact, the leftist turn of China's political situation 
from 
the beginning of this year indicated the beginning of de-Dengism 
pursued by the CPC authorities. 
  The Beijing sources said that at present, only Chen Yun 
among 
the old guard still maintains a certain influence in the CPC 
leadership. Chen Yun was satisfied at Jiang Zemin's tough 
performance, and also expressed appreciation of Jiang Zemin's 
ploy of alternately releasing and arresting pro-democracy 
activists. Recently, when commenting on Jiang Zemin's work, 
Chen Yun said that Jiang could "correctly assess the situation 
and take resolute and realistic action." 
  As the economic reform in the mainland of China entered the 
throes of the stage marked by the agricultural crisis, the 
runaway inflation, the strained state treasury, and the upsurge 
of labor unrest, the CPC authorities shifted the top priority 
from economic growth to the maintenance of stability and the 
prevention of popular unrest. Before another anniversary of the 
4 June incident, the CPC Political Bureau held an enlarged 
meeting, once again stressing the need to take all necessary 
means to prevent troublemakers' activities. It stressed that 
dissidents should be caught boldly, and it does not matter if 
anybody is wrongly caught. Anyhow, troublemakers must not be 
given any opportunity to do what they want. 
  In order to tighten control over pro-democracy activists, an 
addition will be made to Article 18 of the Penalty Regulations 
for the Management of Public Security concerning the treatment 
of those convicted who are put under surveillance, deprived of 
political rights, released on parole, or sentenced with 
suspension, so that pro-democracy activists released from prison 
may be rearrested at any time. 
  In accordance with a central instruction, the local 
authorities in all parts of the country have tightened up 
surveillance over dissidents. According to Guangdong sources, 
former pro-democracy activities working in Guangdong were all 
investigated and interrogated. Recently, many dissidents in 
various parts of the country were arrested or suddenly 
disappeared. Wei Jingsheng, a leading figure in China's 
pro-democracy movement, was arrested in March. Since then, 
nobody knows his whereabouts. Although the CPC authorities 
denied that Wei would be charged with treason, Beijing sources 
said that the authorities would apply the new Penalty 
Regulations for the Management of Public Security to accuse Wei 
of violating the rules for release on parole. 
  In the new arrest spree, many ex-activists were wronged as 
the CPC authorities pursued the policy of "rather arresting 
1,000 innocent people than letting one activist off." A former 
activist in Hunan went to do business in Beijing and met a 
friend who was also a former activist. In the sensitive pre-4 
June period, he was detained for more than 10 days in Beijing, 
and was again taken away by the local public security 
authorities after returning to Changsha. His whereabouts remain 
unknown to other people. 
  Many localities have set up special bodies for preventing 
turmoil and set up riot police brigades in accordance with the 
central instruction. Two months ago 10 antiriot regiments of 
the People's Liberation Army were on the highest level of alert. 
  A mainland intellectual told me that China was now 
experiencing a white terror. The degree of such terror was 
demonstrated by the parade of 10,000 antiriot troops in Changsha. 
  During the pro-democracy movement in 1989, Changsha City in 
Hunan was one of the cities witnessing the strongest popular 
ferment. In early April, the city set up a 10,000-strong 
antiriot force composed of public security personnel, armed 
police troops, and militia units. The headquarters of the 
antiriot force was located in the college district on the west 
bank of the Xiang Jiang. In order to intimidate the public, on 
17 May, the antiriot force staged a large-scale parade around 
the city. The policemen carried machine-guns and rode 
motorcycles; and the militiamen carried wooden clubs and rode on 
large trucks. The mighty procession was filled with an 
atmosphere of killing, which made people recall the dramatic 
scenes of the worker guards during the Cultural Revolution. 
  According to Changsha people, when the antiriot force was 
founded, the daily allowances issued to its members were 
collected from random fines imposed on taxi drivers and drivers 
of other vehicles. This aroused strong resentment among the 
taxi drivers, and their business was seriously affected. 
  As the CPC authorities, which had turned to the leftist 
side, 
feared the appearance of popular unrest, the conservatives, on 
the contrary, tried hard to stir up trouble in society and abet 
workers in staging strikes. 
  After Zhu Rongji exercised macrocontrol to tighten up the 
supply of credit, the state-owned enterprises whose business 
results were always poor were suddenly faced with a halt to 
blood transfusions. Innumerable large factories and mines were 
forced to suspend operation wholly or partly, and workers there 
could not maintain their basic livelihood. Incidents of labor 
unrest arose one after another in all parts of the country. An 
official trade union cadre told me that strikes are happening 
almost every day in China. 
  In the previous issue of KAI FANG, I wrote a report about 
the 
incident in which 100,000 workers in Heilongjiang took to the 
streets to stage a petition-demonstration. The latest news is 
that somebody in the central authorities was fanning such 
strikes behind the scenes. The sources said that some people of 
the former Wang Zhen Office recently became very active in some 
factories and mines, where workers were living in difficult 
conditions. They agitated for people there to stage strikes and 
disturbances. The sources said that such people acted according 
to the ideas of some conservatives in the central authorities. 
Labor unrest mainly took place in state-owned enterprises. The 
conservatives said that the reforms had driven workers to a 
position of losing their means of livelihood, so the 
disturbances staged by the workers could defend the socialist 
public ownership system. Obviously, these people tried to add 
to the troubles of the top leadership and thus force the top 
leadership to back down from the ongoing reforms. 
  The underground labor activists were confused after learning 
about this. They organized workers to struggle for their own 
rights and interests, but they did not want to be used by the 
conservatives. So they did not know what they should do.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Dezhu (2621 1795 3178) From "Earnestly Study </F>
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" 
Column: "Strive To Create a New Situation of United Front Work"] 
  [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the united front 
for the new period is an essential part of his theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. While 
creatively carrying forward and developing Comrade Mao Zedong's 
idea on the united front, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward a 
whole set of theories, which meets the objective needs of 
China's modernization drive, accords with the law governing 
historical development, and bears the distinctive imprint of the 
times. To breathe new life into united front work, we must 
earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially his theory on 
united front work for the new period, to facilitate our study of 
new situations and problems arising from united front work. 
<H5>  I. The Nature of the United Front Is More Clearly Defined </H5>
in the New Period 
  As one of the three magic weapons for China's revolution and 
development, the united front led by the CPC has gone through 
several historical periods. The nature of the united front 
varied with the change in the principal contradiction in society 
and in the party's central task. 
  In his opening speech at the second session of the fifth 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National 
Committee held in June 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: 
China's working class has greatly strengthened its position and 
the worker-peasant alliance will be further consolidated and 
developed on the new basis of the socialist modernization drive. 
A great number of intellectuals have become a component part of 
the working class, and they are consciously working for the 
socialist cause. The means of production owned by the capitalist 
class have been turned over to the state for a long time, and 
most members of the capitalist class who are fit to work have 
become self-supporting workers. Various fraternal minority 
nationalities have taken the socialist road in turn and 
established a new relationship between themselves characterized 
by fraternal unity and mutual assistance. Patriotic religious 
believers in various nationalities have made great progress. 
Compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas 
Chinese love the motherland and are playing an increasingly 
important, active role in the reunification of the motherland 
and in the modernization drive. "China's united front has 
become a broad union of socialist laborers and patriots 
supporting socialism led by the working class and based on the 
worker-peasant alliance." In September of the same year, after 
listening to a report on the 14th national conference on the 
united front work, Comrade Deng Xiaoping extended the front by 
embracing in it all people cherishing a fervent love for the 
motherland, stressing that the united front "is the union of 
socialist laborers and patriots" by nature. Later, he pointed 
out more clearly that the united front in the new period is by 
nature "the broadest union of all socialist laborers and all 
patriots supporting socialism and the reunification of the 
motherland." It is safe to say that this is a most fundamental 
and important thesis showing that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
creatively carried forward and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's 
idea on the united front. Since then, the united front in the 
new period has freed itself from the yoke of the doctrine of 
"taking class struggle as the key link" and has grown and become 
more consolidated with each passing day, holding high the two 
banners of socialism and patriotism. 
<H5>  II. The Patriotic United Front Has Become Broader in the </H5>
New Period 
  After a basic change took place in the class mix in the 
country, some comrades were doubtful as to whether the range 
covered by the united front was too broad or too narrow and 
whether the targets for the united front were too many or too 
few. In light of the circumstances, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
expounded the target and the range of the united front in a 
scientific way. He said: "Clearly the targets for the united 
front, as the term suggests, are all the people that can be 
united. It is a broader range rather than a narrower one that 
is to our advantage." In June 1981, the "Decision on the 
Party's Several Historical Problems Since the Founding of the 
PRC" drafted under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and adopted 
by the sixth plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, 
formally stated: The concept of "patriotic united front" is 
designed to enable all individuals and organizations to join the 
front, irrespective of their social systems, political stands, 
ideologies, and ways of life, to expand the range. Patriotism 
is a banner with a tremendous cohesive force and a strong appeal 
that can achieve broad unity among the people of the Chinese 
nation. 
  Holding high the two banners of patriotism and socialism, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping advanced the scientific idea of "one 
country, two systems" in 1982. 
  By doing so he put forward a 
practical strategy for the united front in the new period, a 
front which comprises two unions: One is composed of all 
laborers and patriots on the mainland on the political basis of 
socialism and the other is composed of compatriots in Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as overseas Chinese, on the 
political basis of supporting reunification of the motherland. 
On the whole, the two unions have three goals, namely: 
Achieving unity among the people on the mainland on the basis 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; achieving 
unity between compatriots on the mainland and those in Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and Macao on the basis of supporting peaceful 
reunification of the motherland; and achieving unity among the 
Chinese at home and abroad on the basis of reinvigorating the 
Chinese nation. 
  The presentation and implementation of the principle of 
"one country, two systems" and the interpretation of the range 
covered by the two unions constituted a new departure in united 
front work for the new period characterized by being based on 
the mainland and keeping in view the outside world. 
Consequently, the range for united front work became broader 
and the number of people drawn into the front greater. 
<H5>  III. There Is a Great Change in the Targets for the </H5>
Patriotic United Front in the New Period 
  With the establishment of a socialist market economy and a 
new change in the socio-economic structure, there has been a 
great change in the targets for the united front. 
  One. The change in the social structure brought about 
by adjustment of the structure of production and the shift 
from primary to secondary and tertiary industries has affected 
united front work. 
  Two. A shift in the ownership structure has resulted in 
a change in the economic structure. A prominent phenomenon 
over the last few years is that the private sector, including 
self-employed industrial and commercial operators, private 
enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises, has grown very 
rapidly. The expansion of the private sector has brought forth 
a number of new representative figures. An important 
mission for our comrades responsible for promoting united front 
work is to carry out the principle of uniting, helping, guiding, 
and educating these representative figures of the private 
sector, so we can choose from them activists who will cooperate 
with our party for a long period, and can encourage, through 
them, their colleagues to love the country, develop respect for 
their work, and abide by law to contribute to the building of 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Three. There is also a change in the contingent of 
intellectuals. A certain number of intellectuals, including 
cultural workers, teachers, scientific researchers, and medical 
and public health workers, quit their posts to "go into 
business" or join managerial staffs of industries using new and 
high technologies. Intellectuals drifting away from their 
original posts have imposed on united front workers a new task 
involving, in particular, winning over non-party 
intellectuals. 
  Four. As members of democratic parties and 
representatives of minority nationalities and religious circles 
of the second and the third generations are replacing their 
predecessors, it is a difficult task to train new 
representatives of democratic parties and religious circles as 
well as minority nationality cadres. And, 
  Five. The increase in the number of overseas Chinese 
and the change in their mix also calls for a change in the 
united front work and presents new problems. 
<H5>  IV. The Patriotic United Front's Task for the New Period Is </H5>
More Important 
  In June 1976, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The task 
for the united front in the new period is to bring every 
positive factor into play and unite with all the forces that can 
be united in a common effort to safeguard and develop political 
stability and unity and build China into a modern, strong 
socialist country. Soon after that he said that it is necessary 
to vigorously develop the patriotic united front to achieve 
reunification of the motherland at an early date. As we are 
trying to make breakthroughs in some key areas, and, at the same 
time, pressing ahead with the whole project of establishing a 
socialist market economy, which represents a profound 
revolution, we will certainly witness a situation in which the 
new system contradicts the old one and advantages are 
accompanied by disadvantages. Radical change in the economic 
field will inevitably exert extensive and intensive influence in 
politics and social activities. This year the party Central 
Committee advanced the 20-character principle of "seizing the 
current opportunity, deepening reform, opening China wider to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability." This is the general task of the country and the 
party as well as the general task of the patriotic united front. 
Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thesis on the mission of the 
patriotic united front in the new period and on the general task 
of the country and the party, the tasks of the patriotic 
united front in the new period are: To work in the interest of, 
first, stability and unity; second, the reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive; third, strengthening democracy and the 
legal system; and forth, the reunification of the motherland--in 
short, to work for the general objective of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. Clearly, the responsibility 
of the united front is heavier rather than lighter than before, 
and the united front is more important to us now than in any 
period before. The united front is not something which is 
dispensable. Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the 
united front remains a magic weapon for us and that it should be 
strengthened and expanded rather than weakened and reduced. 
  V. The Patriotic United Front Has More Prominent 
Social Functions in the New Period 
  In the new internal and external environment, the 
united front has the social function of uniting with as many 
people as possible, promoting democracy, coordinating relations, 
and maintaining stability to serve the general objective of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To 
accomplish the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we must unite with all the forces that can be 
united and bring every positive factor into play. In this 
respect, the united front has a special role to play. The 
essential task of the united front is to achieve unity on the 
broadest possible scale. The competence of a ruling party or a 
leading body is mainly judged by their abilities to make policy 
decisions and to achieve unity. If they make an inappropriate 
policy decision, all will go wrong; if they do not do a good job 
in uniting all forces, all will end with failure. In a sense, 
unity shows how competent they are; unity represents the overall 
interest; unity is strength; and unity is victory. As the 
old system is being replaced by a new one, adjustment of various 
interest relations will inevitably give rise to new 
contradictions. These contradictions are basically 
contradictions among the people. Correctly handling them is an 
important subject of the our political life and also for the 
united front. As the reform deepens and China opens more 
widely to the outside world, especially in the process of 
building up a socialist market economy, new contradictions and 
problems will keep cropping up. Failure to deal with and solve 
these contradictions and problems earnestly and in a timely 
manner will lead to chaos. For example, in general, minority 
nationalities and religious believers are united and the 
relevant situation is stable, but certain contradictions are 
unavoidable. We must make painstaking efforts to solve problems 
concerning minority nationalities and religion when and where 
they make their appearance. Doing a good job in coordinating 
relations among various parties, various nationalities, and 
members of various sectors within the united front is essential 
to consolidating and developing the political situation of 
solidarity, stability, and harmony.

<F P=106> [Report by Kuang Zong (6782 4844): "Social Management </F>
Department of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television Holds 
Meeting to Discuss Ways To Develop Strong Points and Avoid Weak 
Points in `Call-in Hotline' Programs"] 
  [Text] The Social Management Department of the Ministry of 
Radio, Film, and Television recently called a meeting in Beijing 
to discuss "call-in hotline" programs. On the basis of summing 
up and exchanging experiences, the meeting mainly discussed 
measures to strengthen the management of "call-in hotline" 
programs so that this kind of programs can develop the strong 
points and avoid the weak points and create a fine media 
environment for reform, opening up, and socialist construction 
in a still better way. 
  "Call-in hotlines" are a new form in broadcasting reform. 
This form of programs has broken through the traditional mode 
of "one-way" broadcasting and increased the opportunity for the 
audience to participate so that broadcasting can be much closer 
to the masses, life, and reality. "Call-in hotlines" have not 
only won an audience but also injected vitality and vigor into 
broadcasting in competition with the numerous other news media. 
But because management has not kept up with "call-in hotlines" 
since their launching, many problems have surfaced in the course 
of the promotion of this form of broadcasting by radio stations 
of various localities. Some have indiscriminately set up 
"call-in hotline" programs without considering program content 
or whether or not it is appropriate for the programs to be 
broadcast, resulting in too many "call-in hotline" programs and 
too much indiscrimination. Some "call-in hotline" programs 
discuss topics that are devoid of positive meaning. Some 
broadcast boring content and fail to interest the audience. 
Some program hosts are of low caliber, have weak ability of 
expression, and are long-winded. They talk empty words or 
nonsense with the audience, wasting broadcasting time. Some 
"call-in hotline" programs of a few radio stations produce 
content deviating from the principles and policies of the party 
and the government. 
  Strengthening the management of "call-in hotline" programs 
and developing their strong points, while avoiding their weak 
points so that they have their own characteristics and enhance 
social efficiency is an important question in the deepening of 
broadcasting reform. Participating comrades held that it is 
first necessary to strengthen general management and refine the 
programs, saying: It is necessary to integrate "call-in 
hotlines" with traditional form of broadcasting so the two forms 
develop their own strong points and are continuously innovative 
and the tendency of indiscriminately producing "call-in hotline" 
programs in the absence of ripe conditions can be avoided. It 
is necessary to exercise control over "call-in hotline" 
programs. Radio stations that do not have the conditions should 
not indiscriminately launch this kind of program. Those with 
some conditions should also consider their own strength. This 
kind of program should not be too numerous. It is necessary to 
make efforts to improve the quality of call-in programs. 
Second, it is necessary to define the guiding principles for 
all "call-in hotline" programs and set up sound operational 
mechanisms suited them. Programs for conversational purposes 
should have their finger on the pulse of the times. They should 
keep abreast of the changes in social life and the feelings of 
the masses and choose topics in which the masses are interested 
and which have a bearing on the national economy and people's 
livelihood and on tens of thousands of households. They should 
exchange views with the audience through hot lines, propagate 
the party's and government's principles, policies, and new 
measures and should dismiss the masses' misgivings, vent their 
feelings, enhance their confidence, and play a correct role in 
guiding public opinion. Hotline programs for entertainment 
purposes should integrate education and entertainment. Their 
ideological and cultural standards should be enhanced and they 
should nurture the audience with healthy and forward-looking 
programs. Service "call-in hotline" programs should ensure the 
accuracy, truth, and reliability of the broadcast content, 
embodying the principle of earnestly and sincerely serving the 
audience. Programs that involve social problems should first be 
recorded, examined, and selectively broadcast. Moreover, they 
should report the results of reporters' interviews so they play 
the role of supervising the media. Radio stations that launch 
"call-in hotline" programs should establish a sound monitoring 
system, a checking-monitoring system, and a responsibility 
system that match this kind of programs. They should have 
corresponding technical equipment and ensure that this kind of 
programs is safe and of good quality through systems and 
technical measures. Moreover, it is necessary to continuously 
improve the political and professional quality of "call-in 
hotline" program workers, including program hosts, editors, and 
reporters and to enhance their sensitivity and adaptability to 
news to guarantee the quality of this kind of programs.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Steps Taken To Clean Up Pollution"] </F>
  [Text] The quality of China's environment is fairly good, 
considering the pressures put on it from the country's rapid 
economic development. 
  But in a few places, pollution and other kinds of 
environmental deterioration have worsened, according to a 
national report on last year's environmental status released by 
the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) yesterday. 
  On a positive note, less waste water was discharged last 
year. Total waste water discharges amounted to 35.5 billion 
tons, or 3 percent less than the year before. Industrial 
discharges accounted for 21.9 billion tons of the total, a 6.2 
percent drop over last year. 
  The volume of solid industrial wastes stabilized at 20 
million tons last year. 
  Meanwhile, more trees were planted, leading to a new total 
of 
133 million hectares of forested land. 
  But some environmental problems became worse last year. 
  Emissions of certain air pollutants grew. Soot emissions 
rose by 7.1 percent, and sulphur dioxide, which causes acid 
rain, went up by 6.5 percent. 
  All waste gases last year totalled 11 trillion cubic metres. 
  The worse places for air pollution due to coal burning were 
found in the bigger cities of north China during the winter and 
spring. 
  The extent of acid rain did not expand much but it was found 
more frequently in the southern cities, including Jiangxi 
Province's Ganzhou, Changsha of Hunan, Chongqing of Sichuan, and 
Hangzhou of Zhejiang. 
  Atmospheric pollution has become one of the major causes of 
respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchial pneumonia and 
lung cancer. The mortality rate of lung cancer in cities was 34 
per 100,000 people, a rise of 18.5 percent over 1988. 
  Among farmers, respiratory ailments have become the 
number-one killer, with a death rate of 165 per 100,000. 
  The report also said that the urban stretches of big rivers 
and some lakes were seriously polluted. 
  Noise pollution has also worsened, mainly due to crowded 
urban conditions, traffic, and industry. 
  Last year, over 2,700 industrial pollution cases were 
reported throughout the country, an increase of 94 cases over 
the previous year, causing an economic loss of over 220 million 
yuan ($25 million). 
  More than 10 million hectares of farm land were polluted, 
reducing grain harvests by 12 billion kilograms. 
  There were 107 large-scale geological disasters such as land 
collapses, land-slides, and mud flows, claiming 432 lives. 
  The report noted progress in some areas, however. The 
disposal rates of waste gases, water, and solids have been 
raised. And more people have the benefit of central heating and 
piped gas. 
  By the end of last year, 766 natural reserves had been set 
up, taking up 6.8 percent of the country's total area. 
  Preservation centres for endangered animals were established 
in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guangdong Provinces and Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region. Over 300 wild animals have been put under 
State protection. 
  Xie Zhenhua, NEPA administrator, said that the country's 
challenges for the future are to improve its energy efficiency, 
control greenhouse-gas emissions and industrial and urban 
pollution, and develop new technology to protect the environment.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zou Peiyan (6760 3099 7346)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Drawn up on the basis of 
the "International Health Regulations," our Frontier Health 
Quarantine Law symbolizes a move to embody China's health 
quarantine work in law. After eight years of enforcing the 
Frontier Health Quarantine Law, China's health quarantine has 
gradually moved closer to converging with international practice. 
  As health quarantine is an important element of our 
preventive medical science, China has all along attached 
importance to strengthening legal provisions for health 
quarantine undertakings. The "Provisional Procedures for 
Transportation Quarantine" and the "Provisional Procedures for 
Civil Aviation Quarantine" were promulgated during the early 
days of our People's Republic; the "PRC Frontier Health 
Quarantine Regulations" were promulgated in 1957; China 
recognized the "International Health Regulations" in 1979; the 
"Health Supervision Procedures for Frontier Ports" were 
promulgated in 1981; the "PRC Frontier Health Quarantine Law" 
was promulgated in 1986; and the State Council approved the 
rules for implementation of the Frontier Health Quarantine Law 
in 1989. All these have made our health quarantine laws and 
regulations system increasingly complete. The quarantine law's 
implementation has played an important role in safeguarding the 
people's health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. 
  As the country is now in a period of transition from the old 
to the new system, our health quarantine work also extends from 
quarantine examination to international travel medicine, disease 
and health control at ports, and hygienic supervision of 
imported foodstuffs. As the task of health quarantine becomes 
increasingly demanding, there are many new problems in both 
legislation and law enforcement that need to be studied and 
inquired into. A Frontier Health Quarantine Law Society was set 
up recently to enable our health quarantine law enforcement 
personnel to carry out theoretical study and inquiry into the 
Frontier Health Quarantine Law aside from fully enforcing it in 
practice, thus upgrading the law enforcement standard. The 
society will actively carry out theoretical studies and academic 
exchanges on health quarantine laws and regulations of different 
countries and analyze typical cases to provide a basis of 
reference for problems encountered by health quarantine 
personnel in law enforcement practice and to promote legal 
studies on health quarantine. 
  It has been learned that this year the State Health 
Quarantine Agency is also sponsoring, with Jilin University, a 
Master of Law course, which won the praise of Wu Jieping, vice 
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. 
He believes it is really meaningful for health quarantine 
organs, being law enforcement departments, to train 
transcentenary qualified personnel for health quarantine law 
enforcement to upgrade health quarantine law enforcement and 
promote legal construction in our health quarantine. He said it 
will leave a glorious page in our health quarantine history.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Polluters Warned of Criminal Penalties"] </F>
  [Text] In the latest move to stem pollution at its source, 
the central government is urging local authorities to take stern 
legal and economic action against violations of State 
environmental laws and regulations. 
  Individuals and companies that pollute the environment will 
face economic penalties, and serious cases must be prosecuted, 
said Song Jian, State Councillor and Director of the State 
Council's Environmental Protection Committee yesterday in 
Beijing. 
  In a speech marking World Environment Day, Song pointed out 
that the discharge of pollutants into the environment violates 
both public ethical standards and State laws. It harms the 
basic interests of all people and their offspring. He said it 
was a crime similar to smuggling narcotics or marketing fake 
medicine. 
  Song stressed that environmental protection must be based on 
legislative administration accompanied by scientific and 
technological advancement and economic development. 
  He also urged greater publicity to raise environmental 
awareness. 
  One step in this direction will be taken on Wednesday, when 
nine government ministries will jointly launch a TV programme of 
lectures on China's environmental legislation at China Central 
Television Station, Song said. 
  Commemorative activities were held throughout the country on 
the global day, whose theme was "one earth, one family." 
  The Zhongwei Sand-Fixation Forest Farm in Northwest China's 
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region received national focus, since it 
was honoured as one of the "global 500" projects by the United 
Nations' Environment Programme (Unep). 
  Since 1987, 16 individuals and units in China have won the 
title, which commemorates contributions to environmental 
conservation. 
  For the past three decades, the farm has successfully 
protected the railways from Baotou in the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. In addition, it 
has turned 280,000 hectares of desert and sandy land into oasis 
and farmland. 
  The forest farm's techniques have been copied in other 
provinces and autonomous regions, as well as foreign countries. 
  Also yesterday, the National Environmental Protection Agency 
(NEPA) and the All-China Women's Federation jointly sponsored a 
national meeting on Women and the Environment in Beijing. 
  One hundred women were praised for their contributions and 
achievements in the country's environmental protection work. 
  Participants drew up a National Environment Declaration for 
Chinese Women, which called upon women throughout the country to 
devote themselves to global action against pollution and to 
preserve the ecological balance. 
  The declaration says that Chinese women--comprising one-10th 
of the world population--should take responsibility for the 
sustainable development of the global environment. 
  The day also featured the opening of a three-day 
China-United 
States seminar on environment surveillance administration and 
technology.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 5 Jun (XINHUA) -- The first meeting on 
Chinese women and the environment was held today at the Great 
Hall of the People in Beijing in conjunction with a meeting to 
mark the "June 5th" World Environment Day." Addressing the 
meeting, State Councillor Song Jian called for increasing 
society's awareness of the environment, stepping up propaganda 
and education, and fostering environmental ethics. He urged 
every woman to enthusiastically take part in the great cause of 
developing the economy and protecting the environment and to 
create a better tomorrow with concerted efforts. 
  The meeting was jointly sponsored by the State Environmental 
Protection Bureau and the All-China Women's Federation with a 
view to enhancing, among the broad ranks of women, the 
understanding of environmental problems, increasing their 
environmental awareness and enlisting their participation in the 
environmental cause and in advancing China's environmental 
undertakings. Song Jian said: Women play an irreplaceable role 
in the modernization drive. Mothers exercise the most direct 
influence on the youngsters and children -- the future of 
society. We must build such a consensus in society; that is, 
polluting the environment is a behavior that runs counter to 
social ethics and the standards of the law and infringes upon 
the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people and 
future generations. Participation of tens upon millions of 
women in the cause of economic development and environmental 
protection will have a major impact on the family, society, and, 
in particular, the youngsters and children. 
  Cheng Siyuan, National People's Congress Standing Committee 
vice chairman, and Qian Zhengying, National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice 
chairman, were present at the meeting and spoke. [passage

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Environmental Defence"] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow (June 5) is World Environment Day. It is 
a day aimed at increasing people's awareness about the 
importance of environmental protection around the globe. 
  China, with its vast territory and large population, has a 
duty to keep the air fresh and water clean in this part of the 
world. 
  Back in 1973, China convened its first national conference 
on 
environmental defence. In the early 1980s, environmental 
protection was made a basic concern of the State. Since then 
China has paid close attention to environmental protection while 
developing its economy. 
  Over the last 12 years the economy has grown rapidly yet its 
environment has not deteriorated. This has brought great 
benefits to the people. 
  Realizing the importance of a concerted effort in the battle 
to protect the environment, China has forged close relations 
with relevant world bodies. 
  In response to the call of the Earth Summit, held in Rio de 
Janeiro in 1992, China published a white paper earlier this year 
entitled: "Population, Environment and Development in the 21st 
Century." Dubbed "Agenda 21," the proposal lists 63 projects, 
including the cleaning of smokestacks, saving farm land from 
soil erosion, protecting endangered species, and the development 
of sustainable oil reserves. 
  In February, China endorsed three international resolutions 
banning the disposal of radioactive and industrial wastes at sea. 
  Laws and regulations have been adopted, creating a legal 
framework for environmental protection. 
  The Chinese Government has vowed to further strengthen 
legislation and increase investment in this regard to help bring 
about sustained economic development. 
  Spending on environmental protection is to be raised from 
the 
current 0.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), or 20 
billion yuan ($2.3 billion), to 1 percent of GDP by the year 
2000. 
  Like other developing countries, China still has a long way 
to go before radically improving its environment. 
  Despite efforts made, factories in China are discharging 
6.85 
million tons of sulphur dioxide annually, the second highest 
amount in the world. Six billion tons of solid waste are piled 
up across the country and soil erosion caused by the misuse of 
land affects almost 20,000 square kilometres a year. 
  Because many people continue to be indifferent to 
environmental defence, laws and regulations are often not 
implemented and in some cases simply ignored by some local 
authorities. This is one of the main problems faced by those 
carrying out China's environmental protection work. 
  A tightening-up of the issue is needed. Enterprises which 
actively treat their pollutants should be commended while those 
who refuse to do anything about it should have their operations 
shut down and their management fined. 
  In its bid to protect the environment, China has received 
foreign help. In the past decade, the World Bank, the Asia 
Development Bank, and global environmental foundations have 
provided over $1 billion in grants or low-interest loans to 
finance China's environmental protection projects. 
  Such help is much appreciated. 
  As envisaged by "Agenda 21," industrial pollution in China 
will be completely controlled by the year 2000. Such an 
achievement will be an important contribution to the world. And 
China will not relax until it has succeeded in its task.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 June (XINHUA) -- Customs personnel are 
forbidden: to demand reimbursement from recipients of their 
services for all kinds of personal expenses incurred; to use 
their powers of office to provide preferential terms or 
convenience beyond policy regulations for their spouses, 
children, relatives, or friends to do business or import or 
export commodities; and to serve as paid intermediaries. These 
are the new demands on all customs personnel in the revised 
"Customs Regulations on Maintaining a Clean and Honest 
Government" recently promulgated by the General Administration 
of Customs. 
  Customs first enacted and promulgated the "Customs 
Regulations on Maintaining a Clean and Honest Government" in 
1990. In the course of implementing these regulations, it was 
discovered that dishonest acts occurred mostly during contact 
between customs personnel and recipients of their services. 
Based on this, Customs enacted and promulgated in 1991 the 
"Regulations Governing Specific Problems During Contact Between 
Customs Personnel and Recipients of Their Services." These two 
regulations played an important role in regulating customs 
personnel's conduct, rectifying malpractice in customs 
departments, and promoting the construction of clean and honest 
customs administration. In light of the development of the 
situation and the characteristics of customs departments, 
Customs again amended the two regulations to make them more 
oriented toward current problems and more practicable. 
  While retaining most of the original contents, the revised 
regulations also incorporate the requirements for maintaining 
honest and clean government reiterated and practiced in customs 
departments over the past year. They include: Customs are 
forbidden, without exception, to engage in service trades, with 
the exception of logistics and science and technology services; 
to demand, for any reason, assistance from recipients of their 
services; to take part in highly expensive entertainment 
sponsored in their honor by recipients of their services; and to 
intercede for someone else or interfere in law enforcement 
during customs investigations.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Academy of 
Engineering (CAE), the country's highest institution in the 
field of engineering technology, was inaugurated today at the 
opening of the seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
  During the first grand gathering of the two academies, 
scientists and engineers will explore China's future development 
in science and technology and elect the first batch of foreign 
academicians for the CAS, the country's top scientific body, as 
well as elect its president and vice-presidents. 
  All the seven members of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central 
Committee -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu 
Rongji, Liu Huaqing and Hu Jintao -- met with the academicians 
present at the two conferences and posed for a picture with them. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, 
congratulated them on the inauguration of the CAE and the 
holding of the seventh academicians' conference of CAS. 
  Jiang called the period from now until the middle of the 
next 
century a great historical period for the invigoration of the 
Chinese nation. 
  He said it is imperative to rely on scientific and 
technological advances to achieve the economic and social 
development, well-being of the people and prosperity of the 
nation, in a country with the world's largest population, weak 
foundation and relatively lower stock of natural resources, he 
said. 
  The establishment of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, he 
noted, will give scope to the creativity of engineers and help 
promote the research, design, construction and operation of the 
engineering technology, said Jiang. 
  In his address to the conference, Premier Li Peng said China 
will unswervingly implement the guiding principle of Deng 
Xiaoping's thesis: "Science and technology is the first 
productive force," adhere to the principle that "economic 
construction should rely on science and technology while science 
and technology must serve economic construction". 
  He said the target of China's scientific and technological 
restructuring is to build a new structure which goes with the 
development of the socialist market economy and the development 
value of science and technology, integration of science and 
technology with the economy so as to promote scientific and 
technological advances. 
  He expressed the hope that CAS and CAE will work together to 
make greater contributions for the modernization of the country. 
  Lu Jiaxi, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, and honorary chairman of the 
Presidium of CAS, delivered an opening speech at the conference. 
Zhou Guangzhao, president of CAS, and Zhu Guangya, executive 
chairman of the Presidium of the inauguration conference of CAE, 
made their work reports to the conference. 
  During the conference, the Chinese scientists will elect the 
first batch of foreign academicians for CAS, amend and pass "the 
Academicians' Constitution of CAS" and issue the Hua Luogeng 
Science Award. 
  "The Constitution of CAE" will be discussed and drafted 
during the current conference. 
  Among those present at today's conference were also Zou 
Jiahua, member of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee 
and vice-premier, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political 
Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee, Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of 
the State Science and Technology Commission, Luo Gan, state 
councillor and secretary-general of the State Council, as well 
as Qian Weichang and Qian Zhengying, both vice-chairmen of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng hailed 
today the inauguration of the Chinese Academy of Engineering 
(CAE) and the opening of the seventh academicians' conference of 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
  Addressing the inaugural meeting, the premier said that the 
founding of the CAE is a major event in the scientific, 
technological and engineering communities and of great 
significance for China's socialist modernization drive. 
  He lauded the great contributions the Chinese technological 
and engineering communities have made to the country's economic 
construction and national defence since the founding of New 
China in 1949. 
  Li pointed out that China has done a good job in many fields 
of engineering and technology and trained large numbers of 
outstanding workers in science and technology. 
  For this reason, the premier said, the founding of the CAE, 
with outstanding experts in technological communities as its 
mainstay, will have a far-reaching impact on improving their 
social status, on arousing their enthusiasm and on stepping up 
the country's development of engineering technology. 
  Li noted that the CAE is most honorable, consultative 
academic organ in China's engineering communities. 
  He hoped that the CAE, entrusted by the central government, 
will give advice and suggestions on the state's major scientific 
and technological projects and programs, and on research and 
studies on major development issues. 
  He also hoped the CAE will make active contributions to 
implementing the government's policies and principles on the 
work of science and technology, and to academic exchanges and 
cooperation at home and abroad. 
  To further facilitate international exchanges and embody the 
authoritative and honorary status of the CAS membership system 
founded in 1955, the State Council decided to grant the CAS 
members the official title of "academicians", which is an 
international practice, while the academicians system will be 
carried out in the CAE, the premier said. 
  He said the first batch of foreign academicians of the CAS 
is 
expected to be selected during the meeting. 
  Li said the concept of "science and technology is the first 
productive force" put forward by Deng Xiaoping, should be 
carried out unswervingly throughout the whole course of the 
socialist modernization drive. 
  He said that attention should be paid to three things: 
science and technology serving the country's economic 
construction, developing the high-tech industries and 
strengthening the basic studies. 
  The premier also highlighted the aim of reform of scientific 
and technological system as the establishment of a new system 
that suits the development of a socialist market economy, 
accords with the law of science and builds a close tie between 
science and technology and economy. 
  Talking about the international competition in science and 
technology, Li said that the CAE and CAS, the country's two top 
scientific bodies, should coordinate closely to make greater 
contributions to the country's modernization drive. 
  He also urged the government and party leaders at all levels 
to take more care of the work and life of scientists and 
technical workers.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier of the 
State Council Zou Jiahua affirmed the achievements of the 
general inspection of commodity prices at an earlier time at the 
national conference on general inspection of commodity prices 
which ended today. He put forward a clear demand on continuing 
to do a good job in the general inspection of commodity prices. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out: Through concerted efforts by various 
departments, the general inspection of commodity prices in the 
earlier period was carried out in a smooth manner. A number of 
cases concerning commodity prices which violated the related law 
were investigated and due punishment was meted out, and some 
erroneous practices of wanton raising of commodity prices and 
wanton collection of fees were rectified. Those efforts have 
made producers and operators strengthen their internal 
management concerning prices and improved the order of commodity 
prices and the market. They have played an active role in 
ensuring market stability, reducing prices of commodities, and 
easing the people's minds, and have also created a favorable 
economic and social environment for the smooth implementation of 
various major reform measures. 
  Zou Jiahua said: Despite the fact that recently the trend of 
inflation has been alleviated, the tasks of controlling 
inflation, stabilizing the market, and reducing commodity prices 
are still crucial links in correctly handling relations between 
reform, development, and stability. To continue doing a good 
job in the general inspection of commodity prices, we must 
further unify our thinking and understanding and enhance our 
consciousness of doing a good job in the general inspection. 
The most important thing is that we must correctly understand 
and handle relations in the following three aspects: 
  1. We should correctly understand and handle relations 
between the deepening of price reform and the strengthening of 
control over commodity prices. To establish a socialist market 
economy, we must carry out reform of the price system. To put 
it briefly, we should change the mechanism in the formation of 
prices and establish a mechanism of deciding prices primarily 
through market regulation, we should straighten up the price 
system and establish a system of comparable prices which can 
reasonably allocate resources, and we should reform the 
traditional price management system and establish a price 
adjustment system controlled indirectly by the government. To 
realize those goals in reforming the price system, we must 
adhere to the policy of integrating "adjustment, relaxation, and 
control" of prices. We should have control over the adjustment 
and relaxing of prices to ensure that there will not be a 
disorderly situation while having flexibility in the price 
system. Even when the task of reform of the price system is 
completed, the state must still have control over the prices of 
certain commodities and services with a monopolized or welfare 
nature. We must not let the prices of those commodities and 
services go astray. 
  2. We should correctly understand and handle the relations 
between supervision and inspection of commodity prices and the 
reform and administration of prices. When the prices of most 
commodities are decontrolled, the task of price reform is still 
not completed. We must continue to change the price mechanism 
and raise the prices of basic products [ji chu chan pin 1015 
4342 3934 0756] and facilities in a planned and systematic 
manner, and further straighten up the price system. Meanwhile, 
we should establish and perfect a new price adjustment and 
control system and management methods to suit the new situation 
of decontrol of prices. This is an urgent task in price reform 
today. At present, the problems of manufacturing and selling 
fake and shoddy commodities to earn big profits, wantonly 
raising prices, and monopolizing the market are still quite 
conspicuous. Those problems have aggravated inflation. We must, 
through the general inspection of commodity prices, guide the 
behavior of setting prices. Reaping staggering profits and 
cheating are not in accord with the requirement of the law of a 
market economy and must not be allowed. We must take a 
clear-cut stand to oppose and stop such behavior in setting 
prices. 
  3. We should correctly understand and handle relations 
between the adjustment in the management of the price system and 
economic growth. The purpose of conducting general inspection 
of commodity prices and implementing the adjustment and 
regulation of commodity prices is to improve the order of 
commodity prices in the market, control the excessive rise of 
commodity prices, and promote economic development in a fast and 
sound manner. This is favorable to the overall economic 
situation and economic development in various locales. All 
locales and departments must subordinate their interests to the 
interests of the whole, unify their thinking, and take 
coordinated actions. 
  Zou Jiahua emphatically pointed out: In conducting the 
general inspection of commodity prices, we must have a clear 
goal and pay attention to key problems. The principal leading 
comrades of governments at various levels must personally pay 
attention to the work, and leading cadres in charge of the work 
must be responsible for the work, make proper arrangements for 
the general inspection of commodity prices, create favorable 
conditions for the execution of duties by price inspection 
personnel, and help inspectors solve difficulties and problems 
in their work. Various departments under the State Council 
should seriously implement the guidelines of the "State Council 
Circular on Carrying Out the General Inspection of Commodity 
Prices Throughout the Country," adopt concrete measures to 
coordinate with commodity price departments, give full play to 
the advantage of joint efforts of all departments, and ensure 
the smooth implementation of the general inspection of commodity 
prices. 
  In conclusion, Zou Jiahua asked various locales to attach 
great importance to the passing of related laws on price and 
manage the price system in accordance with the law as quickly as 
possible. In particular, it is necessary to step up efforts to 
draft a "law on commodity prices," enacting laws and regulations 
on opposing fraud, opposing staggering profits and monopolized 
operation, and formulating rules for supervising and inspecting 
commodity prices. We should gradually standardize and 
institutionalize the management, supervision, and inspection of 
prices. Price inspection personnel must exercise laws in a 
strict manner, be honest, have self-discipline, actively explore 
news ways and methods in inspecting commodity prices according 
to the law of the market economy, and make still greater 
contributions to stabilizing the overall situation, deepening 
reform, and promoting development. 
  To further promote the deep-going development of the general 
inspection of commodity prices, the State Council's working 
group on the general inspection of commodity prices will go to 
various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in 
mid-June to supervise and guide the work and implement various 
arrangements made by the current conference.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Data processing by 
computer and information analysis will be carried out in 1994 as 
China's general investigation of the service industries enters 
its second phase. 
  Addressing a telephone conference on the subject here today, 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said that this phase demands more 
high-level technology, professional knowledge and more hard work. 
  He said that since the second half of 1993, the general 
investigation has been carried out smoothly by three million 
investigators all over China. 
  "The investigation of the first phase has been fulfilled 
successfully," Zou said, thanking all the individuals who had 
contributed to it. 
  He pointed out that this investigation is another of China's 
national strengths, following the census and the general 
investigation of industry. 
  He said that the abundant and accurate information from the 
investigation is a valuable resource for China. 
  "The utilization of the information must be treated as very 
important by the country's governments at all levels," he said.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Survey of Service Sector To Help Plan Labour </F>
Force"] 
  [Text] An ongoing nationwide survey of China's service 
industry, scheduled for completion by year's end, is expected to 
produce key guidelines for the country's redistribution of its 
huge labour force, a senior official has said. 
  China's service industry, which is far from fully-developed 
and lags behind the fast-growing economy, is widely viewed as 
the major outlet for the millions of surplus urban and rural 
labourers in this country of 1.2 billion people. 
  This unprecedented examination of the service sector, 
launched last August and involving some 3 million people 
compiling data at the grassroots level, has achieved initial 
success, a conference was told on Saturday [4 July]. 
  Its progress is being closely watched by the government, 
which believes the results will enable it to assess the 
potential of the country's service industry and plan its future 
development, according to Vice Premier Zou Jiahua. 
  Speaking at a national telephonic conference held in Beijing 
on Saturday, Zou noted that he believes the nationwide survey 
will reflect the real conditions of the country's service sector. 
  It queries all individual businesses and service companies 
operated by the government, industrial and agricultural 
enterprises, military units and private, business people. 
  The survey covers conditions of transportation, finance, 
insurance, telecommunications, real estate information, 
technology and education. 
  Computerized data processing and information analysis is the 
major task this year for the survey, which is being jointly 
conducted by the State Planning Commission and the State 
Statistics Bureau. 
  Zou pointed out that this will be the country's third type 
of 
major national survey, in addition to the population census and 
the industrial survey completed a few years ago. 
  Analysts say the government's effective macro-economic 
control of the service industry will help in relocating the 
country's surplus labourers. 
  At present, more than 25 percent of the country's industrial 
employees are considered surplus according to production needs, 
they added . 
  Meanwhile, another 100 million farmers also are considered 
surplus because they have no land to farm. 
  Government officials say the nationwide survey is a prelude 
to developing a socialist market economy system. 
  Zhang Sai, director of the State Statistics Bureau, said 
China needs to build various free-trade markets involving the 
production materials, finance, technology, business information 
and real estate sectors. 
  He noted that the survey is vital to improving the service 
industry which will in turn attract more foreign investment, 
technology, equipment and talent. 
  Furthermore, the survey is expected to establish advanced 
statistics systems that can guide the service industry and 
economy in the future.

  [Text] Tianjin, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- At a national work forum 
on bonded zones today, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
Member and State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing stressed the 
need to seek unity of thinking as well as standardize and 
improve bonded zone administration to really make such zones new 
growth points for China's open economy that will spur on 
regional economies and promote development of the open economy. 
  The national work forum on bonded zones was held in Tianjin. 
  After giving a briefing on the sustained, rapid growth of 
our 
foreign trade, Li Lanqing fully affirmed the achievements of the 
bonded zones since they were introduced more than two years ago. 
He said: The bonded zones were a result of our efforts to draw 
lessons from current international practice -- including the 
advantages of bonded warehousing, export processing zones, and 
other administrative models -- as well as a new kind of pilot 
project for opening up China's economy under prevailing national 
conditions. Over the past two years, the bonded zones have 
demonstrated their unique advantage and played a positive role 
in attracting foreign investment; exercising the functions of 
export processing, transit trading, and warehousing; promoting 
convergence of the domestic and international markets; spurring 
on regional economic development; and other areas. The bonded 
zones' unique position, advantage, and demonstrative effect are 
increasingly pronounced in the overall pattern of China's 
opening up to the outside world. 
  Since 1991, our nation has approved the establishment of 13 
bonded zones covering a total area of 17.62 [as received] square 
kilometers. Most of these bonded zones have been put into 
operation. By the end of March 1994, these bonded zones have 
approved the establishment of a total of 5,813 enterprises 
involving $8.8 billion in investment and handled the import and 
export of goods worth $1.74 billion. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: Although the bonded zones have 
achieved great results, there remain many unstandardized and 
flawed practices in our bonded zone system as compared to 
current international practice and these practices have 
restricted healthy development of our bonded zones. He proposed 
solving these problems from two aspects. 
  First, we should have a correct understanding of and give 
full play to the three basic functions of bonded zones. In 
other words, we should give full play to their export processing 
function, try hard to develop their international transit 
trading function, and give active play to their function in 
providing trade services such as warehousing and commodity 
display. Particularly in bonded warehousing, it is necessary 
to, in the light of domestic demand, properly and purposefully 
store up agricultural chemicals, petroleum products, and other 
important commodities for use as contingency supplies. These 
basic functions are the bonded zones' major distinctions from 
economic development zones and special economic zones. 
  Second, we should further standardize and improve bonded 
zone 
administration. The present administrative system of most 
bonded zones calls for further improvement. A bonded zone 
should be a specially designated zone under the supervision and 
jurisdiction of customs and be regulated mainly by the customs 
and bonded zone administration committees instead of all kinds 
of administrative and law enforcement organs. Furthermore, the 
administrative rules and regulations for bonded zones are not 
complete or standardized. So far, there has yet to be a unified 
and complete set of rules and regulations for the 13 bonded 
zones across the nation, and this has hampered their healthy 
development. 
  Li Lanqing especially stressed: All bonded zones should 
study and draw up their own development direction and strategy 
based on individual characteristics and conditions to give full 
play to their overall relative advantage and spur on regional 
economic development. 
  He said: If we are to bring about healthy and orderly 
development of bonded zones, we must standardize administration. 
Generally speaking, we should refer to current international 
practice when standardizing bonded zone administration and build 
our bonded zones into a point of convergence and a mixture of 
the international and domestic markets to gear business 
operators directly to the needs of the grand international 
market. With the exception of commodities under state import 
and export bans and rationing, goods and capital may flow freely 
between the bonded zones and the international market. It is 
necessary to exercise effective and tight control over the flow 
of goods and capital between the bonded zones and other parts of 
the country in strict accordance with stipulations by relevant 
state policies, to build the bonded zones into a new model for 
developing an externally oriented economy with complete 
institutions, simple and convenient formalities, quality 
services, and highly effective and tight administration. To 
this end, we should stress the following principles: 
  Reform the administrative system for bonded zones; simplify 
the customs' supervisory and administrative formalities and 
enhance self-discipline among business operators; suit monetary 
policy for bonded zones to their peculiar needs; employ advanced 
technology to improve administrative means and strengthen 
administration; and pay particular attention to resolutely 
cracking down on unlawful smuggling activities. 
  In conclusion, Li Lanqing emphatically pointed out: In 
issues related to bonded zones, we must properly handle matters 
that should be handled and firmly refuse to do things that 
should not be done. We must do good things properly and never 
spoil them. 
  After the meeting, Vice Premier Li Lanqing visited the 
ongoing "1994 Export Commodity Fair of Tianjin, China" in the 
company of Tianjin Municipal CPC Secretary Gao Dezhan and Mayor 
Zhang Lichang and held an informal discussion with the heads of 
trading delegations from various localities on existing problems 
in foreign trade. Li Lanqing also inspected the Tianjin Customs 
and had lunch at the canteen together with customs personnel.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, state councillor, 
and minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring 
Commission, and Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing municipal party 
committee, today visited some enterprises in Beijing to 
investigate and study the means of establishing a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Full of zest, Li Tieying and Chen Xitong viewed the progress 
made by the Beijing Department Store (Group) Limited Company in 
Wangfujing, the Beijing Tongrentang Group Company, the Beijing 
Chemical Industry Group Company, and the Beijing Peony Electric 
Group Company in establishing a modern enterprise system. They 
also held informal discussions with Zheng Wanhe, Tian Yumin, Sun 
Zhenyan, and Chen Jie, the general managers of the four 
enterprises, regarding the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system. 
  In recent years, the four enterprises carried out plenty of 
preparatory work as they explored the means of establishing a 
modern enterprise system. Li Tieying fully affirmed their 
efforts. 
  Li Tieying said emphatically: A fundamental way to lift 
state-owned enterprises out of their predicament is to establish 
a modern enterprise system. He hoped that enterprises in 
Beijing would keep exploring boldly, intensify research, 
constantly sum up experience, and explore a microeconomic course 
for organically combining public ownership with the market 
economy while bearing in mind the need to solve their existing 
practical problems. 
  The Beijing Department Store has evolved into a limited 
company engaged in 10 major lines of business, including 
commerce, production, processing, advertising, and stock 
business. Grouping scientific, industrial, trading, production, 
supply, and marketing operations, the Beijing Tongrentang Group 
Company sells its products nationwide, as well as to more than 
40 countries and regions. The Beijing Peony Electric Group 
Company has joined the nationwide ranks of electronic 
industries, acquiring a capacity to produce 1 million color 
television sets, its leading product. Last year, the Beijing 
Chemical Industry Group Company achieved 5.28 billion yuan in 
total industrial output value, posted 500 million yuan in 
profits and taxes, and took in $40.50 million in 
export-generated foreign exchange, ranking second in the 
country's 100 large chemical groups in terms of composite 
economic efficiency.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Planning 
Commission, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Public 
Security Ministry recently issued a joint "Circular Concerning 
Lawful Punishment of Criminal Offenses Against Price Inspection 
Personnel in Executing Official Duties." 
  The circular points out: Lately, vicious incidents of 
jointly beating price inspection personnel have occurred 
frequently, posing a threat to price inspectors in executing 
their official duties, directly impeding normal operations of 
the general price inspection, and causing serious social 
repercussions. To ensure smooth progress of the general price 
inspection, price departments and public security and 
procuratorial organs at all levels must investigate and handle 
cases of using violence or coercion to obstruct price inspection 
once they are discovered, dealing with them resolutely to ensure 
the personal safety of price inspectors and the smooth progress 
of price inspection. 
  The circular says: Public security and procuratorial organs 
at all levels must enforce the law and handle cases strictly 
according to the law. Cases of obstructing price inspectors 
from performing official duties, which constitute an offense 
against public order, must be duly handled by public security 
organs according to the relevant provisions in the "Regulations 
Governing Punishment for Offenses Against Public Order." Once 
facts are verified and evidence proven, cases of using violence 
and coercion to obstruct price inspectors from performing their 
official duties should be promptly examined and transferred by 
the public security organ to the procuratorial organ for 
approval to arrest, indictment, and investigation of offenders' 
criminal responsibilities according to the law. In the course 
of handling cases, price departments and public security and 
procuratorial organs in all localities should step up the 
publicity and education, teaching business operators to 
conscientiously abide by various government price policies and 
regulations, to engage in lawful operations, and to voluntarily 
accept price inspection. Price-inspecting offices at various 
levels should strengthen education on the legal system among 
price inspectors to enhance their level of law enforcement and 
enable them to perform duties strictly according to the law.

<F P=106> [By Julian Brutus] </F>
  [Text] Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and 
petroleum products are entering southern China despite a blanket 
ban on crude-related imports. Traders estimate at least 500,000 
tonnes (4.4 million barrels) of fuel oil arrived in the country 
in May alone and a similar amount is expected this month. The 
state-owned giant, Unipec, which distributes oil products, 
including diesel and petrol, is one of the key importers along 
with independent traders, according to Hong Kong analysts and 
traders. 
  Mainland authorities decreed a two-month ban on imports of 
oil and petroleum at the start of May in a bid to reimpose 
central control on the sector and push down rising inflationary 
pressures. The key area of concern was a growing number of 
independent operators importing oil products for speculative 
purposes and selling it at vastly inflated prices. 
  But the ban aimed at choking off these independent oil 
traders, appears to be regularly flouted by the state companies, 
independents and some large multinational oil companies with a 
steady flow of products still reaching the mainland. 
"Originally, small lots (of diesel) were transported in barges 
up the Pearl River," one source said. "But last week we heard 
of consignments of 10,000-20,000 metric tonnes being ordered. 
The larger quantities will probably be supplied by the majors." 
  Traders at several independent Hong Kong-based companies 
estimate that up to 40,000 tonnes of diesel alone entered China 
since the curb was imposed. The most common method used by 
independent companies to import crude products without official 
permission is to persuade port officials to turn a blind eye to 
the landing of a shipment. "In China, as in some other Third 
World countries, a job at a customs posts is given out as a 
reward with tacit approval for any extra income the official may 
be able to manage," said a respected shipping commentator. 
  Shipments which are taken by pipeline to storage beyond port 
boundaries do not have to be declared as having been landed at 
the port. There are only a few ports in southern China where 
this is possible, the chief ones being Shanghai, Guangzhou, 
Ningbo, Xiamen, Maoming and Zhanjiang. All these ports are 
capable of accommodating oil tankers, and have extensive storage 
facilities. 
  Major international oil companies and the Hong Kong-based 
independent companies supply the booming industries in the 
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) on China's southern coast, which 
rely on diesel to power their generators. Both groups say 
diesel sales are increasing with most current Chinese 
requirements planned for June delivery. 
  But why is Unipec ignoring the government ban? In a word, 
expediency. "It seems there are exceptions to the ban," said 
one source. "If a company in, say, Guangzhou, can demonstrate 
that it has a requirement, the Government might say `sure, go 
ahead'." 
  This is happening at the same time that Beijing maintains 
domestic stocks of these products are already high, and that 
importing them is a serious drain on the country's foreign 
exchange. Stocks in the north of the country -- where oil is 
produced -- do seem to be high, but the demand is in the south 
and the infrastructure is too poor to transport it efficiently. 
  In any case, domestic production cannot match supply, and 
the 
Government relies on the industries in southern China to 
generate foreign exchange. Imports of oil and products -- which 
only began last year when burgeoning private enterprise 
increased domestic demand many times over -- have played a large 
part in China's alarming 1993 US$12.25 billion (about HK$94.5 
billion) trade deficit. 
  Last year, for the first time, China became a net importer 
of 
oil and products. About 10 per cent of the 1.1 billion barrels 
processed nationwide was bought on the spot market, mostly from 
Australia and West Africa. This proportion is forecast to rise 
dramatically this year. The Government has entered long-term 
agreements with Middle East states and is considering doing the 
same with Brunei. 
  In 1992, Sinochem -- China National Chemicals Import and 
Export Corporation -- exported 20.87 million tonnes of crude 
oil, and 4.28 million tonnes of oil products. In 1993, exports 
of oil and products were virtually nil; imports of crude oil 
were 14 million metric tonnes, and imports of products totalled 
11 million metric tonnes. China's official imports of diesel in 
1993 are put at 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes per month. 
  Increased imports are not entirely bad news for the 
exchequer, however. On May 7 this year Beijing set new ceilings 
for prices of domestic crude, diesel and petrol -- 900 yuan, 
1,900 yuan and 2,430 yuan respectively -- virtually doubling the 
existing prices and thereby bringing them closer to world spot 
market prices. These prices allow the Government to buy on the 
international spot market, add various taxes and then sell the 
products on the domestic market at the new prices. 
  A Singapore-based trader said the current ban on imports 
was aimed at the 200 to 300 independent Chinese companies that 
had been importing shipments which they sold for big profits and 
which had contributed to inflation. The first real casualties 
of the current ban seem to be the major oil companies hoping for 
a foothold in the Chinese market. 
  Beijing would like to limit the operations of foreign 
companies, and the companies see the current ban as the latest 
in a long list of difficulties they have to deal with. Recent 
reports have outlined several reasons why these firms find 
dealing with the mainland "a nightmare" and concluded by saying 
that the "gifts" required by bureaucrats are growing and 
therefore eating into profits. Oil companies were quoted as 
"having taken enough". 
  Other problems include import bans, reneging on contracts, 
price ceilings which have slashed profits and constantly 
changing official policy. Privately, many companies have also 
complained about the preferential treatment accorded to certain 
joint ventures and companies. 
  Analysts say the Chinese energy sector needs the raw 
materials, cash, expertise and technology that Western companies 
can provide, but Beijing is obviously determined to have the 
upper hand in all dealings. "The Chinese have a different 
attitude to doing business," said one source. "Western 
companies regard the signing for a contract as the end of a 
process; the Chinese regard it as a beginning. 
  "This used to trouble me, but I have grown to accept it now; 
it is the only way to continue doing business." 
  The agency report, however, makes it clear that the major 
companies have run out of patience, as some of them find their 
best efforts in China are resulting in losses instead of the 
expected profits. At least three majors are engaged in lawsuits 
worth more than US$1 million each against a Chinese company that 
failed to honour spot deals. 
  Perhaps one should give Beijing the benefit of the doubt and 
accept that the Western oil companies are incidental casualties; 
after all, the Government's intention is to drive Chinese 
independent companies out of business. According to a document 
to be published soon, Beijing intends to buy up or close down 
these companies. 
  Spokesmen from Sinopec and Unipec admit that independent 
traders have succeeded in landing imports despite the previous 
and current ban. The officials, who asked not to be named, said 
that only small quantities of oil and products were involved, 
and that the Government was not greatly concerned about the 
problem. 
  The official view of the quantities concerned may well be 
correct, but even if it does not make a significant impact on 
the overall economy, it shows Beijing has less control of the 
sector than it would like. "The Government may issue 
directives," said another Singapore-based trader, "but whether 
they will be carried out is another matter; connections play a 
very large part in getting business done in China." 
  What are the prospects of success for the Government? "Hard 
to say; I don't know enough about the mechanics of imposing 
government wishes. But I think that if the Government can't 
exercise more control over the energy sector they might as well 
pack up," said the trader. 
  Analysts say China's economic growth requires the finance 
and 
expertise of foreign oil companies, and pulling out of the 
country now would be foolhardy. The troubled state of the 
domestic industry was highlighted two weeks ago when the Huabei 
oil field near Beijing closed 21 inefficient wells and decided 
to run another 34 only intermittently to save money. 
  China currently produces 1.2 million barrels per day of the 
low- grade Daqing oil from Heilongjiang Province, and 600,000 
barrels per day of slightly higher-grade Shengli from Shandong. 
This is about 142 million tonnes annually. Offshore output is 
expected to be 5.5 million tonnes this year. 
  On May 18, Beijing announced it had set aside 24 blocks of 
land covering 294,00 square kilometres for oil exploration by 
domestic companies. Two days later it opened 13 areas covering 
40,000 sq km in the South China Sea for offshore exploration by 
foreign companies. It was the first time China had invited bids 
through acreage promotion, and the move was prompted by a lack 
of funding and inadequate technology. Exploration, however, is 
a notoriously long-term and uncertain operation.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Rules on Bond Sales Toughened"] </F>
  [Text] China has taken tough action to apply the brakes to 
the short-selling of treasury bonds to ensure the market's 
smooth development. 
  The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of 
Finance and the People's Bank of China jointly issued a circular 
recently calling on parties to "resolutely stop" the short 
selling of treasury bonds. 
  Local finance bureaus, branches of the central bank, and 
securities exchanges and centres must take effective measures 
against short-selling as of July 1. 
  The action was taken because some securities intermediaries 
are selling more treasury bonds than they actually own by 
issuing custody certificates to buyers. 
  This practice in effect expands the total amount of treasury 
bonds, endangering the country's macroeconomic management and 
investors' interests. 
  According to the circular, which will go into effect on July 
1, the treasury bonds traded over the counter should be the 
paper bonds issued by the State and not the custody certificates. 
  Institutions trading bonds through securities exchanges or 
centres should put all their bonds, paper and paperless, under 
the central custody centres of the exchanges and trading centres 
. 
  Only after that will they be able to trade their bonds on 
exchanges or State-approved electronic securities trading 
systems. 
  If securities trading institutions issue custody 
certificates, they should have an equal amount of note bonds. 
  If institutions have fewer paper bonds than the amount 
registered in the certificates already issued, they should make 
up the gap by June 20. 
  Holders can exchange their certificates for paper bonds any 
time. No certificate issuer can refuse a request . 
  The circular requires the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities 
exchanges and all local securities trading centres to draft 
their own self-regulating rules. These regulations will be 
reported to the Ministry of Finance. 
  Bond-trading institutions violating the circular's 
stipulations will be suspended from doing business for three 
months to a year. 
  Bond-trading institutions are responsible for arranging to 
be 
examined by the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China 
and the China Securities Regulatory Commission. 
  Trading institutions should set up different accounts for 
custody bonds and self-dealing bonds.

  [Text] A standardized receipt for the value-added tax 
designed with tough fraud-prevention techniques will be 
introduced to taxpayers nationwide beginning in July, according 
to an official announcement by the State Administration of 
Taxation released yesterday. 
  The receipt has three different versions: a Chinese version 
(including the Tibetan and Uygur language versions), a 
Chinese-English version and a computerized version. 
  The Chinese and Chinese-English versions both include three 
different forms, covering tax values of 10,000 yuan ($1,150), 1 
million yuan ($115,000) or 10 million yuan ($1.15 million). 
  The receipts are made by the money printing company under 
the 
People's Bank of China, the central bank. Enterprises or 
individual are forbidden to print the receipt themselves. 
  The former receipts will be invalidated as soon as the new 
receipts are issued, the announcement says. 
  Any enterprises or individuals who illegally forge, sell or 
lend the receipts will be severely punished. 
  China launched a nationwide tax reform at the beginning of 
the year, aimed at setting up a fair taxation system to read 
just the industrial structure and promote equal competition, 
according to tax officials. 
  A new business tax with the value-added tax as its major 
component is the main element of this taxation reform.

  [Text] China arms maker North Industries Corporation 
(NORINCO) has set up a fund to be listed on the Irish Stock 
Exchange to raise US$170 million (about HK$1.326 billion) [Hong 
Kong dollars]. NORINCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China's 
defence ministry, which has a number of investments that have 
been transformed from military applications to manufacturing 
civilian products. None of the money raised will be used for 
military purposes. 
  The closed-end fund is being placed to both local and 
European institutions and is due to list in Ireland next month. 
NORINCO will issue 16.5 million units at US$10.30 (about 
HK$79.50) each. H.G. Asia will act as arranger of the issue. 
The proceeds from the issue will be used for joint ventures 
under NORINCO. The corporation has a number of joint ventures 
and subsidiaries, mainly industrial projects, such as the 
manufacture of motorcycles and optical equipment. 
  One of its subsidiaries, Jialing Motorcycle Plant based in 
Sichuan province, is a well-established motorcycle manufacturer 
on the mainland. Other industries include optical equipment 
manufacturing, with technology that was originally applied for 
military use, such as in the production of telescopes and glass 
for aircraft. 
  NORINCO will be carrying out fund-raising exercises in 
phases. This is the initial phase, to raise US$170 million to 
invest in enterprises engaged in the manufacture of cars. A 
further fund-raising exercise is expected in the next couple of 
years. NORINCO, which is directly under the State Council, 
comprises 157 state-owned industrial enterprises with fixed 
assets of 60 billion yuan (about HK$52.8 billion). 
  The corporation has been very active in car manufacturing 
and 
related industries. Last year, NORINCO signed a joint-venture 
agreement with Hong Kong-based financial services and investment 
company Pacific Group to set up car parts factories on the 
mainland. They comprise three plants in Changchun, northeast 
China, and eight in Chongqing, Sichuan province, which between 
them produce brakes, clutches, starters, transmissions, 
universal joints and other parts. 
  Merchant bankers said that there had been many fund-raising 
activities by mainland companies in the last 12 months. These 
funds may attract overseas investors as the demand still exceeds 
supply. However, more Chinese enterprises are seeking funds to 
finance their development and expansion, and the Chinese 
Government placed controls on credit to curb inflation in the 
middle of last year. 
  Given that it was almost impossible to borrow from banks, 
many borrowers had to pay very high interest rates of between 20 
and 30 per cent to get short-term funds, he said. [as published] 
Apart from paying higher costs, however, these borrowers could 
only temporarily ease their cash crunch, he added. 
  With more mainland enterprises seeking funds overseas, there 
will be a large number of China projects available on the 
market. "Investors tend to buy selectively on quality projects, 
so China concept stocks may not be guaranteed a warm reception 
now," he said. "The time spent on listing work is shorter and 
easier, and the listing costs are cheaper in Ireland," said a 
European fund manager. 
  The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong requires companies to 
possess 
a three-year track record and a minimum market capitalisation of 
$50 million. There is a current proposal to raise 
capitalisation requirements to $400 million.

<F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>
  [Text] Mainland brokerages may have to play their part in 
Beijing's plan to enforce two compulsory six-month guidance 
periods for mainland candidates seeking a listing -- one before 
and one after their listings. China's top securities watchdog, 
the China Securities Regulatory Commission, has called on listed 
companies to standardise their operations and suggested a 
six-month "coaching period" to guide companies both before and 
after they list. 
  A senior official of a Shanghai brokerage said the six-month 
coaching periods before and after listing would probably be 
included in the supplementary provisions to the Securities Law. 
Although details of the guidance procedure had yet to be 
officially announced, he said Beijing's securities authorities 
were aiming to improve the quality of companies through the 
proposed system. 
  The brokerage official speculated that mainland stockbroking 
houses would be designated as "coaches" because they were more 
familiar with the companies, compared to securities authorities. 
In addition he said companies would be more willing to accept 
guidance from brokerages rather than securities authorities 
because the former were comparatively more independent and the 
latter more official. "It is highly possible that some 
stockbroking houses will become coaches for listing candidates," 
he said, pointing to the big brokerages with good performance 
records. 
  The official expected there would be requirements on what 
was 
a qualified coach and on the procedures and goals for coaching. 
He speculated that the chances for foreign brokerages to be 
given the opportunity to coach would be low because they were 
not as familiar with the situation on the mainland. The aim was 
that company management should be instructed in relevant legal 
knowledge and the appropriate manner to disclose information as 
well as the importance of adhering to listing plans in 
prospectuses. 
  Under the existing securities regulations, it is clear that 
big changes in a company's business is not allowed in the first 
year of listing. But the brokerage official said most companies 
did not follow what they pledged in prospectuses. "Most 
companies follow what we tell them before their listings, but 
once they get the money, our words fall on deaf ears. What they 
care about is nothing more than how to spend the money," he said. 
  The official said the proposed plan would help raise the 
discipline of issuers and their legal knowledge, which would 
effectively raise the overall quality of listed companies on 
China's stock exchanges. This was because the responsibility 
would fall on the coach, not just the companies, if the 
companies did not follow their listing plans. 
  However, Bankers Trust Asia Research Vice-president Lily Wu 
said that the coaching period was redundant. She said the 
companies knew that, according to the rules in the Standard 
Opinion on share issues and trading, they could not make big 
changes in businesses in their first months after listing. "We 
know companies do not follow the rules and waste their money. 
They just pump their money into property...," she said. 
However, Ms Wu said the coaching period would contribute to the 
chance of the government exerting too much interference in the 
stock markets.

  But he disclosed that Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd and Nomura 
Securities Co. Ltd will act as lead managers for the issue. 
  China's Ministry of Finance returned to international

  In February this year, it successfully issued one billion 
U.S. dollar Global bonds, the biggest issue ever carried out by 
the ministry.

<F P=106> [By Zheng Jie: "Investors Snapping Up Bonds"] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai -- Shanghai citizens are queuing up with 
great enthusiasm for this year's sale of two- and three-year 
State treasury bonds. 
  Last Sunday [29 May], local citizens snapped up 6.5 billion 
yuan ($747 million) in two-year notes, according to the 
municipal office orchestrating the bond issue. 
  The office said local securities firms playing a major role 
in underwriting the treasury notes, have taken up 2.8 billion 
yuan ($322 million) in bonds, more than 10 per cent of all the 
two-year notes being sold by the central government this year. 
  The figure is 65 per cent more than the total bought by 
local 
investors last year. 
  Shanghai Finance Securities Co took the lead by underwriting 
700 million yuan ($80 million) worth. 
  Sales figures for the three-year bonds, underwritten by 
banks, were still being calculated, but the Shanghai branch of 
the central bank said things were going smoothly. 
  The warm response to the issue, which is scheduled to end at 
the end of this month, put officials in the municipal office at 
ease. They said it is possible that, for the first time in 
recent years, demand may outstrip supply. 
  In the last two or three years, local authorities have had 
to 
resort to administrative measures to issue treasury bonds, which 
lost public favour because of inflationary pressure and the 
appeal of the city's fast-growing stock market. 
  However, with the stock market losing ground for more than a 
year, officials said, investors are redirecting their attention 
to the safer investment of bonds. 
  The favourable interest rates and flexible terms are the 
major attractions of this year's treasury bonds. 
  The annual interest rate of the two-year bonds is 13 per 
cent, 1.3 points higher than bank deposits of the same duration. 
  The interest rate for the three-year bonds, offered as 
certificates of ownership, will be 13.9 per cent, surpassing 
banks' three-year fixed deposits by 1.7 points. 
  Though the three-year bonds will not enter the market like 
the two-year bonds, purchasers will be able to cash their 
certificates in advance and still obtain higher interest than a 
bank deposit if they hold onto the bonds for more than six 
months. 
  To lure more buyers, the Finance Ministry has encouraged 
people to cash in their 1991 three-year treasury bonds, due on 
July 1, and their five-year 1989 special treasury bonds early to 
buy the new bonds. 
  These buyers will be offered an additional percentage point 
for their old bonds.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 5 (XINHUA) -- The markets for 
B-shares are beginning to become bullish as overseas investors 
are optimistic about such markets, according to analysts here. 
  The B-shares index -- shares of companies in China issued to 
foreigners to buy -- rose for 11 trading days and fell for eight 
trading days on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in May. 
  Analysts said that the index opened at 63.18 points and 
peaked at 76.70 before hitting bottom at 62.57 on May 3, the 
first trading day during the last month. 
  The index closed at 75.55 on may 27, the last trading day 
during the month. 
  Analysts said that a total of 189 million B-shares changed 
hands during month, averaging 9.94 million shares daily, up 74.6 
percent over April. 
  One analyst summarized the movement of B-shares throughout 
May as a "breakthrough." 
  The index of B-shares began to climb from the low in 
mid-April and rose substantially in mid-May, he said. 
  However, the index of A-shares -- shares of companies in 
China issued to Chinese to buy -- remained sluggish throughout 
May. 
  Most B-share holders are institutional investors, while most 
A-share holders are individual investors, another analyst said. 
  Relatively speaking, B-share holders are more mature because 
they usually make long-term investments, while A-share holders 
eye short-term investments, with a strong tendency towards 
speculation, he explained. 
  Analysts agreed that one reason for the bullish market for 
B-shares is that China's economy is now operating smoothly, with 
its industrial production continuing to rise. 
  The government's macro-economic control measures have begun 
to take effect as shown in a stable increase in state revenues, 
the withdrawal of large amounts of currency from circulation and 
a big rise in savings deposits in both urban and rural areas. 
  Another reason is that the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission has decided to expand the B-share market, formulate 
regulations governing the management of B-shares and improve the 
system for revealing information concerning the trading of 
B-shares, analysts said. 
  The scope of B-share investors is expanding, they said. For 
example, the Japanese Government has decided to permit Japanese 
nationals to invest in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  The third reason is that overseas investors have been 
relieved of worries about the Chinese market. 
  For instance, the U.S. Government has recently announced the 
decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status. 
  At the end of May, the Morgan Stanley Company of the United 
States proposed in a report that managers of mutual funds should 
increase the ratio of their investments in the Chinese mainland 
and Hong Kong to 10 percent from eight percent.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Foreign Demand for Labour Revives"] </F>
  [Text] New requests for Chinese workers are pouring in as 
the emerging labour markets in Hong Kong, Singapore and South 
Korea pull themselves out of slumps. 
  An earlier Sino-British agreement for big-ticket financing 
of 
the new Hong Kong airport had given the go-ahead to Chinese 
contractors, who virtually stopped their jobs because the two 
governments were at loggerheads over the project's budget. 
  "The construction (by Chinese) is going on pretty well," 
said 
Chen Yongcai, who oversees China's labour exports for the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. 
  The Sino-British disputes were a major factor as the value 
of 
China's overall labour contracts shrank continuously through 
June of last year. 
  Another reason for the slowdown was the restriction on 
labour 
imports imposed by Russia, a traditional market for Chinese 
workers. 
  Unlike the Hong Kong airport issue, the Russian restriction 
continues to cast a shadow over Chinese labour exports. 
  China and Russia have agreed on the export of l2,000 Chinese 
workers to Russia, but only 2,000 have been allowed entry. The 
remaining 10,000 are waiting on the Chinese side of the border. 
  Chen said the governmental contracts must be honoured. 
  The Russians are afraid that the influx of thousands of 
Chinese labourers might unsettle the country's vast Far Eastern 
region. 
  Some Russian reports have falsely claimed that at least 1 
million Chinese labourers are in the region. 
  There may indeed be far more than 12,000 Chinese in the 
region, but few of them are bound by governmental contracts. 
There is little dispute that Russian authorities should stem 
the flow of these unorganized individuals. 
  Most Chinese workers who go to Russia under bilateral 
agreements are engaged in vegetable planting and home 
construction. 
  Chen reaffirmed that Chinese labourers will never seek to 
linger in other countries when their contracts are fulfilled. 
  Another Chinese official expressed the belief that the 
difficulties in Sino-Russia trade are only temporary. 
  Despite a downturn in the Russian market, China's labour 
export contracts in the first four months this year picked up 
22.7 per cent over the same period last year to $2.05 billion. 
Actual business turnover grew by 48 per cent to $1.44 billion. 
  Altogether 174,000 Chinese workers are overseas, 4,000 more 
than a year earlier. 
  Chen said the increase was seen mainly in Hong Kong, Macao, 
South Korea and Singapore. 
  He predicted that there soon will be more than 10,000 
Chinese 
workers in South Korea alone, as several thousand workers are 
leaving for the country. Chinese workers there mainly serve in 
small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. 
  Chen also revealed that China is ready to resume its labour 
exports to Iraq as soon as the United Nations' economic 
sanctions are lifted. 
  "And," he added, "we're ready to restore co-operation with 
Yemen." 
  China withdrew all its workers, medical teams and teachers 
from Yemen when war broke out there.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (CNS) -- China civil aviation 
industry had been monopolized by the state in terms of 
investment, construction and management for the past several 
decades. Foreign businessmen have been recently allowed to 
engage in this industry by way of Sino-foreign joint investment, 
cooperation and buying shares of China's enterprises 
specializing in air shipment, the move, considered as an 
important measure of reform in this sector, will greatly promote 
the development of this industry. 
  "The Circular on Policies Related to Foreign Investment in 
Civil Aviation Industry" recently jointly issued by the Civil 
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the Chinese Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation says that in line with 
the principle of putting the state's investment in a dominant 
place, foreign businessmen are allowed to conditionally engage 
in investment in and running of civil aviation industry in China 
in ways of making joint investment or cooperation in 
construction of airports (excluding those airports used both for 
military and civil purposes), runways, taxi-ways, aprons, 
terminal buildings, hotels and restaurants at airports and food 
and fuel items for aviation. In these jointly-funded entities, 
more than 51 percent of their total registered capital must be 
controlled by the Chinese side and their chairmanships of the 
board of directors and posts of general managers must be chaired 
by personnel from the Chinese side. 
  It is reported that at present investment in and management 
over the air traffic control system in China has been still 
monopolized by the state and no foreign airport authorities and 
aviation manufacturers are allowed to set up enterprises for 
aviation transportation in the country.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "China Builds Up an Industry To Break Ships </F>
Apart"] 
  [Text] Everyone might know that breaking a ship apart is 
much easier than building one, but few realize how much money is 
to be made in this trade. 
  Chinese businesses seem to understand the details of the 
multi-billion-yuan trade better than most others. 
  After investing nearly 240 million yuan ($27.5 million), 
China leads the world in the business of dismantling ships, 
controlling half the market. Nevertheless, its industry sees 
plenty of room for growth. 
  In fact, the China National Ship-Breaking Corp is joining 
hands with other Chinese firms to build the country's largest 
ship-breaking centre, in Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province. 
  Also signing an agreement last month to become partners in 
the new China Jingtong Ship-Breaking and Washing Co Ltd are 
Zhoushan Ship-Building Industrial Corp and Zhejiang 
Ship-Breaking Corp. 
  First-stage construction will enable the complex to 
dismantle 
old ships for scrap metal and valuable machinery, especially 
communications and navigation equipment. Work is expected to be 
completed in a year and a half. 
  After that, China Jingtong will be capable of taking apart 
retired ships with more than 2 million dead-weight tons combined 
each year. It will also be equipped to clear greasy dirt from 
ships' cargo holds and recycle more than 500,000 tons of oily 
water annually. 
  Government officials say the centrally controlled Zhoushan 
centre will dominate the domestic ship-breaking industry, which 
now comprises more than 200 enterprises. 
  Since the early 1980s, China has bought more than 10 million 
dead-weight tons of old ships from abroad for dismantling and 
salvaging. 
  Chinese salvagers believe foreign ship owners will continue 
to sell old vessels for scrap because keeping them operable is 
expensive, especially during a recession like the one currently 
gripping the shipping business. 
  Analysts say ship breaking is closely linked to the fortunes 
of the world's shipping industry: Sluggish shipping means 
hectic business for salvagers. 
  The central government is enthusiastic about boosting the 
industry, official sources said. This way, they say, the 
country gets scrap steel rather than having to rely on imports, 
and foreign-exchange costs are cut by as much as a third. 
  But, they added, Chinese workers are not trained well enough 
in the business of dismantling ships. Experts estimate that if 
a ship of 10,000 dead-weight tons is taken apart scientifically, 
an additional 600 tons of metal can be salvaged and 30 days' 
work saved. 
  Shipping companies and factories that build and repair ships 
should educate workers so that machinery and equipment that is 
still usable is not wasted. These machines and equipment should 
be examined by experts and assigned quality certificates so they 
can be sold off.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 4 (XINHUA) -- With the rapid economic 
growth along the Chang Jiang River, China's longest, the ports 
along the river have attracted more and more foreign ships. 
  On May 7, 1983, a Panama-registered ship arrived at 
Zhangjiagang, a port in the lower reach of the Yangtze, as the 
first foreign ship ever entered the river since 1949 when the 
People's Republic was founded. Over the past 11 years, about 
50,000 ships from more than 50 countries and regions in the 
world have docked at the 13 ports along the Chang Jiang River. 
  Foreign ships with displacement of up to 10,000 tons can 
sail 
to the ports from Shanghai to Nanjing in the lower reach of the 
Chang Jiang River, and ones with displacement of up to 5,000 
tons can get to the ports up to Wuhan from Nanjing in the medium 
reach of the river. 
  In the first three months of this year, the ports along the 
lower and middle reaches of the Chang Jiang have served more 
than 3,000 foreign ships. 
  More than 50 ports along the Chang Jiang River in Jiangsu, 
Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces have set business relations 
with more than 50 countries and regions in the world. 
  The ports also opened up more than 30 international 
transport 
routes to foreign countries. 
  The export cargoes at Wuhan port, such as steel and 
fertilizers, can be shipped to more than 20 countries.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- In the next few years, 
China will concentrate manpower and financial resources on 
tackling several key chemical engineering technologies which 
have an important bearing on the development of the chemical 
industry and the economy as a whole to lay a foundation for a 
high-technological chemical industry. 
  A national meeting on scientific and technological progress 
in the chemical industry closed here today. According to 
information from the meeting, the Ministry of Chemical Industry 
has proposed that higher priority be given to the development of 
nine key technologies in the Ninth Five-Year Plan of the 
chemical industry. They include new catalysis technology, new 
separation technology, biochemical technology, and computer 
application. The plan also covers 10 major projects, including 
a synthetic ammonia plant using natural gas as raw material with 
an annual output capacity of 300,000 metric tons and a urea 
plant using an ammonia gas process with an annual output 
capacity of 520,000 metric tons; and projects for the 
development of refined industrial chemicals in the agricultural 
drug, dyestuff, electro-chemical, and three other major 
categories. 
  The Ministry of Chemical Industry proposed that 30 major 
scientific research results and new technologies be put to use 
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period. They include the 
10,000- etric-ton-class ionic membrane caustic soda producing 
technology and the 10,000-metric-ton-class polyvinyl chloride 
resin producing technology. It is reported that China's 
chemical industry will develop more than 300 new major chemical 
products annually in the last five years of this century; and by 
the year 2000, the output value of high-technological chemical 
products will account for approximately 10 percent of the total 
output value of China's chemical industry.

<F P=106> [Report by Xi Mi from the "Opinion" page: "Who Really Owns </F>
the Township Enterprises?"] 
  [Text] The introduction of shareholding into co-operative 
systems should give township enterprises a new edge according to 
Lu Yongjun, an official with the policy bureau of the 
Agriculture Ministry. 
  Ever since their rise in the late 1970s, township 
enterprises 
have contributed handsomely to the country's economy growth. 
  In 1993, their output value totalled 2,902 billion yuan 
($330 
billion)--71 percent of the output value in rural areas. 
  Their export value reached 235 billion yuan ($27 billion), 
about 45 percent of the country's total . 
  However, in the current transformation of the nation's 
economy, from a centrally planned to a market economy, the 
development of township enterprises has been increasingly 
hampered by ambiguous property rights. 
  Who really owns township enterprise is a burning question 
which must be answered. 
  In rural enterprises sponsored by local communities, such as 
townships or villages, the property right belongs to the whole 
community, but no individual in particular. 
  As a result, the community leadership randomly interferes 
with the enterprises' internal management, thus preventing the 
workers themselves from bringing their initiative into full play. 
  The production factors of different regions, trades and 
ownerships cannot be transferred, let alone be used efficiently. 
  "To solve these problems, township enterprises must speed up 
reform of property rights," said Lu Yongjun. 
  To promote property right reform and to ultimately establish 
a modern enterprise system, the Agriculture Ministry recently 
issued a non-mandatory document giving advice on how to conduct 
shareholding co-operative reform in township enterprises. 
<H5>  Dividends </H5>
  Township enterprises which have adopted co-operative 
shareholding generally perform better than those which have no 
shareholding system. 
  According to Lu, shareholding co-operative enterprises refer 
to those enterprises formed by at least two investors, who, on a 
voluntary basis invest either money, materials, technologies or 
land use right in an enterprise. As shareholders in the 
enterprise they can receive dividends according to the 
performance of the enterprise in relation to their percentage 
shareholding. 
  Shareholders should have a voice in advising the management 
of the enterprise. 
  According to Lu, the township shareholding cooperative 
enterprises comes into being in three different ways. 
  First, some of the self-employed and private businesses 
establish enterprises themselves. 
  Secondly, some township enterprises introduce the 
shareholding co-operative system themselves to achieve better 
management, performance and profits. 
  Thirdly, there are some newly opened enterprises which 
adopted the shareholding model from their very beginning. 
  "Up to 1993, co-operative shareholding enterprises amounted 
to 10 per cent of the country's township enterprises," said Liu 
Zuyin, another official from the Ministry. 
  The increasing pressure of market competition and sometimes 
the die-hard prejudice against private enterprises, have been 
two driving forces for the formation of shareholding 
co-operative enterprises which are collective in nature. 
  To implement property right reform, an effort should at 
first 
be made to define and clarify it, so as to make possible its 
transference through sales, merger, bankruptcy and auction, 
inheritance and donation. 
  "At present, the most important thing is to evaluate 
enterprises' assets. This assessment should be realistic, 
scientific and plausible, in line with the related standards, 
procedures and methods stipulated by the State," said the 
Ministry. 
  Township authorities should invite specialists and 
representatives from the community and workers from the 
enterprise to attend assessment work in order to carry out 
careful planning, full investigation and accurate assessment of 
the value of property. 
  Based upon the clarification of the ownership of property 
right, shares can be made available to townships, individuals, 
social institutions and overseas investors. 
  In certain selected areas, markets which trade in property 
rights should be established. 
  In principle, property rights should be held by original 
investors. The owners can manage the property, maintain and 
increase its value, and benefit from the progress. 
  But there is still some ambiguity concerning the shares 
belonging to the townships. 
  "For the sake of boosting productivity, enterprises are 
encouraged to explore whatever ways are necessary to solve 
ambiguities," Liu said. 
  Han Jun and Zhang Qingzhong, two researchers from the Rural 
Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 
offer three options to solve ambiguities. 
  They suggest that the shares of township enterprises be 
transformed into prior stock, so the local authorities can only 
gain extra dividend from their shares, but have no say in the 
enterprises' management. 
  Another option is to cut up the cake. This would involve 
canceling collective shares and converting all the enterprise's 
stored property into shares completely owned by the individual 
employees. 
<H5>  Modification </H5>
  However, certain articles of the State's codes governing 
township collective enterprises stipulate that the property of 
the collective enterprise belongs to all members of the township. 
  The researchers call for a change of such irrational 
articles 
of State, because they only provide local authorities with a 
legal basis for interfering in the management of enterprises. 
  The third option is to auction the property of the township 
collective enterprise to employees, social institutions and 
individuals. 
  Income of the shareholding co-operative enterprise should be 
distributed according to the performance of the worker and it 
should also be in proportion to the volume of shares they hold. 
  A percentage of profits should be turned in as tax and a 
contribution to the accumulation fund. Part should also be used 
to balance any operational deficits from previous years. Any 
remaining profit might be shared out as a dividend among 
shareholders. 
  Revenue from the sale of township shares should be used for 
the enterprises' further expansion, social welfare, or to fund 
agriculture in the environs of the enterprise. They should not 
be used to cover the township government's administration fees, 
said the Agriculture Ministry's directive. 
  Local authorities should not interfere in any administrative 
sense with co-operative shareholding companies. Instead, they 
should try to provide management guidance and services. 
Enterprises must of course, listen to the supervision of the 
local authorities and observe their social obligations. 
  Liu said that this directive is non-binding. "The 
shareholding co-operative system was actually invented by 
farmers. What we are doing now is trying to collect valuable 
experiences from the co-operative shareholding system so they 
can be passed on to other township enterprises." 
  Liu acknowledged that the research of the shareholding 
co-operative system lags far behind their traditional role in 
the economy of blazing new roads to prosperity. 
  In Zhejiang Province, the number of township enterprises is 
80,000; in Shaoxing County alone there are 506 of them, with 1.2 
billion yuan ($138 million) in capital. 
  Liu said that when workers become real owners of their 
enterprise, they will surely try to improve their internal 
management. But whether or not they select boards of directors 
or call meetings for shareholders depends upon the enterprise 
employees themselves. 
  Liu emphasized that while encouraging the cooperative 
system, 
the government also supports enterprises to be contracted, 
leased or merged so long as they can become efficient.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- China is expected to 
reap another good harvest of summer crops this year despite a 
decrease of sown areas of some crops and soaring prices of 
agricultural materials. 
  Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed today 
that the total harvesting area for summer oil-bearing crops this 
year amounted to 5.3 million hectares, an increase of 330,000 
hectares over last year. Output of oil-bearing crops would 
register a greater increase, he said. 
  By now, the provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, 
Jiangxi and Sichuan have all reported increases in harvests of 
such crops. The increase, along with the imports of edible oil, 
would greatly ease supplies soon, the official said. 
  The official said that China's summer grain will also reap a 
good harvest despite a marked decrease in sown areas. 
  But the official warned that it was too early to be sure of 
a 
good summer grain output, because while the southwest is busy 
harvesting, the north is still waiting. 
  The official therefore urged all localities to concentrate 
on 
the final work with the crops and to watch for the weather in 
harvesting time so as to ensure an excellent output.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- Flooding in various 
areas in southern China has reminded people of the impending 
annual flood season north and south of the Chang Jiang. 
According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters, the key flood control provinces of Hubei, Hunan, 
Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong, as well as the key 
flood control municipality of Beijing, began charting this 
year's flood-control plans in the immediate wake of last year's 
flood season. They have completed preliminary preparations for 
preventing heavy floods and combating major disasters. 
  Mindful of the frequent incidence of floods and drought in 
our country, Chen Junsheng, state councilor and head of the 
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, last 
October noted that the end of the 1993 flood season would signal 
the beginning of advance preparations for the 1994 flood season. 
Acting in the aftermath of last year's flood season, the key 
flood control municipality and provinces paid close attention to 
harnessing rivers, repairing water-damaged structures, and 
reinforcing defective and hazardous reservoirs. Drawing lessons 
from last year's accidents at Qinghai's Gouhou Reservoir and 
Shandong's Longshan Coal Mine, various localities stressed both 
construction speed and quality in building flood-control 
projects. Last year, Shandong Province invested 500 million 
yuan in water conservancy projects, mainly to harness rivers, 
combat waterlogging, repair water-damaged structures, and 
reinforce defective and hazardous reservoirs. Hubei Province 
also devoted close attention to the construction of flood 
diversion and storage zones. The provinces are now intensifying 
efforts to complete the final stages of projects or to conduct 
acceptance tests. Most projects may become operational and 
yield flood-control benefits during the flood season. The 
provinces have strengthened the management of projects that 
cannot be completed before the flood season, and called for the 
formulation of measures to ensure safety in tiding over floods. 
  Since last winter, good progress has been made in projects 
aimed at clearing river obstacles. Hubei has instituted a 
system by which administrative chiefs assume responsibility for 
clearing obstacles, established relevant files, set deadlines 
for clearing obstacles, and designated responsible personnel. 
Henan has made unremitting efforts to remove sludge from small 
and medium streams, whereas Jiangsu and other provinces have 
stepped up efforts to clear obstacles and improve their 
flood-discharge capability. 
  To make adequate preparations for preventing heavy floods, 
the key flood-control provinces have paid attention to 
instituting and improving preventive flood-control filing 
systems to guard against problems that have arisen during 
previous floods. Plans for mobilizing and using large and major 
mid-sized reservoirs in those provinces during the flood season 
are undergoing the examination and approval process. 
  Preparations should be made in advance. After last year's 
flood season, all localities conducted a general inventory of 
their flood-control emergency supplies, overcame difficulties in 
channeling funds and materials, and actively stockpiled relevant 
materials whose delivery has now been completed. 
  A State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters 
official reminded all localities of the need to heed these 
problems regarding advance preparations for the flood season: A 
significant number of people lack a strong foreboding sense 
about flooding, current flood-control projects are of unduly low 
standards, and flood-control administrative bodies are poorly 
structured and insufficiently funded. It is hoped that the 
departments concerned will help solve these problems, and that 
people in all sectors of society will show concern for 
flood-control work, join forces in confronting the flood season, 
and make every effort to ensure safety in weathering floods.

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA)-- China's timber resources 
have been growing steadily while the resources in other part of 
the world are on the decrease, Chinese Forestry Minister Xu 
Youfang said here on the eve of the "World Environment Day". 
  The average annually-added timber resources had surpassed 
the 
annual consumption for the 10th year since 1984, while during 
1977-1981, the country's timber resources shrank by an average 
of 18.7 million cu m [cubic meters] annually, the minister said. 
  He said that China's timber resources grew by 400 million cu 
m on average each year during 1989-1993, while 320 million cu m 
of timber was cut down. 
  During 1984-1988, the figures were 366 million cu m and 344 
million cu m, respectively. 
  The minister attributed the steady growth to the common 
efforts of the Chinese people. 
  The Chinese Government made it one of its basic policies to 
green the country and improve its ecological environment. 
  At the suggestion of Deng Xiaoping, the National People's 
Congress passed a resolution in 1981 calling on Chinese people 
to plant trees every year, so as to help green the country, the 
minister recalled. 
  Ever since, Chinese leaders have been taking their lead in 
early spring each year to plant trees. 
  Up to date, about 18 billion trees have been planted by 
individuals all over the country. 
  Several large ecological projects initiated in the late 
1980s 
also contributed to the growth of forest resources, including 
the shelterbelt network stretching from northeast to northwest 
China, 13,000 km coastal shelterbelt network and a large program 
to plant 6.6 million ha of trees, using 300 million U.S. dollars 
of world bank loans. 
  Facing a serious ecological environment and insufficient 
forest resources, China will continue its efforts to green the 
country and increase its forest coverage rate to 15.3 percent by 
the year 2000, the minister said. 
  By the year 2000, the gross forest output value will be 
increased to 300 billion yuan (38.4 billion U.S. dollars) from 
the present 140 billion yuan (17.9 billion U.S. dollars), Xu 
said.

<F P=106> ["XINHUA Commentator": "If We Want to Reap Bumper Harvests </F>
the Entire Year, First We Must Strive To Succeed in `Reaping 
Harvests, Sowing Seeds, and Conducting Field Management in the 
Summer'" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Now is the time of Grain 
in Ear [the ninth solar term]. The campaign for "summer 
harvest, summer sowing, and summer field management [three 
summers]" is making its progress from south China to north China. 
  The year 1994 is crucial for China to establish a socialist 
market economic system. The success or failure of agricultural 
work and whether or not a bumper harvest is reaped will 
determine, to a great extent, the speed of development for the 
entire national economy. The Agricultural Department 
specifically pointed out: The general objective for this year's 
efforts is to increase peasants' income and to ensure the supply 
of essential agricultural products. It has important 
significance for arousing the enthusiasm of peasants for 
production and for promoting the development of a market economy. 
  In light of China's farming situation, we should focus the 
entire year's agricultural work on "three summers." If we want 
to reap bumper harvests the entire year, first we must strive to 
succeed in doing "three summers" work. Tens of thousands of 
peasants have rushed to the forefront of "three summers" and the 
party and government departments in all areas have assigned a 
large number of cadres and technicians to draw up specific plans 
and to guide summer harvest, summer sowing, and summer field 
management. Materials, transportation, grain, and banking 
sectors have already allocated various materials, funds, farm 
machinery, and vehicles necessary for "three summers" to their 
proper users. The broad masses of peasants are getting ready to 
give full play to their abilities on the "three summers" 
battlefield. 
  Thanks to the importance attached by the party Central 
Committee and the State Council stabilizing the agricultural 
sector and to vigorously promoting agricultural production, 
coupled with the propitious weather this spring, crops are 
growing satisfactorily. To really obtain summer grain, all major 
grain producing areas should use all the manpower, material 
resources, machinery, and facilities at their disposal to 
harvest any plot of farmland with ripe grains, thresh grains 
immediately after they are harvested, and store every harvested 
grain in warehouses. Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other major 
grain producing provinces already joined the forces of large 
combine harvesters to harvest wheat from provinces in south 
China to those in north China according to the time when wheat 
becomes ripe in each province. The interprovincial operation 
expedited the harvest's progress and improved the utilization 
ratio of large farm machinery. Owners of wheat farmland were 
satisfied and harvester operators were pleased. It was as good 
as a kind of creation by peasants under the new situation of a 
market economy; and it expedited, to a greater extent, the 
process of agricultural modernization. 
  Summer grain will be harvested soon. Grain procurement 
departments should prepare adequate grain-storing facilities and 
procurement funds, and should create every favorable condition 
whereby they can immediately buy up the grain once it is 
delivered. They should pay cash to peasants for the grain 
delivered. According to the requirements of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, grain procurement departments 
are prohibited from issueing IOU's, refusing to buy available 
grain, and retaining payments for peasants' grain under various 
pretexts. Protecting peasants' enthusiasm in producing grain is 
a major principle that overrides all other minor principles. 
  China's autumn grain production is a major event. Pursuing 
the principle of enhancing productivity, efficiency, and 
quality, various localities should pay attention to weather 
conditions and make use of favorable geographical positions. 
Once a piece of farmland has been harvested, we should promptly 
sow seeds on it. If the topsoil is moist, we will use it 
immediately; otherwise, we will wet the topsoil before using it. 
We should create all favorable conditions so as to adequately 
and properly plant autumn grain. We should take realistic and 
effective measures to resolutely reverse the decrease in the 
acreage of farmland so as to maintain a steady rise in grain 
production. Such moves are not only prerequisites to ensure an 
effective supply of grain, but are also requirements to 
stabilize the agricultural sector as the foundation of the 
national economy. 
  Proper summer field management will ensure a bumper harvest 
for the entire year. As the saying goes: "Planting tasks will 
contribute to 30 percent of the outcome, whereas management will 
make the other 70-percent contribution." Planting is the 
foundation and management is the key. Mismanagement in 
flood-prevention, drought-resistance, weeding, pest-termination, 
or fertilizer application will adversely affect the entire 
year's harvest. Raising investment to enhance scientific and 
technological progress is an important link in summer field 
management. According to predictions, various pests will still 
be serious in certain localities in 1994. Bollworms, in 
particular, caused a massive reduction in cotton output in some 
major cotton-producing regions in 1993. Various 
cotton-producing regions should mobilize corresponding 
scientific and technological personnel to strictly terminate 
bollworms. Various scientific and technological departments in 
the agricultural sector should earnestly apply scientific and 
technological achievements in the field and integrate summer 
field management as a part of the comprehensive scientific and 
technological services, which include checking the conditions of 
seedlings, preserving the water content and fertility of the 
soil, preventing pests, and enhancing the plants' growth. 
  Now that the "three summers" tasks are being carried out, we 
can expect a bumper harvest of summer grain soon. So long as 
the leadership and the rank and file make concerted efforts in 
unison, let the market economic mechanisms play their full 
levering-roles in the economy, and victoriously complete the 
"three summers" tasks, we can lay a firm foundation for a bumper 
harvest in the agricultural sector for the entire year.

  [Text] Kunming, June 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists have 
succeeded in artificially cultivating 108 species of endangered 
plants in southwest China's Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical 
Garden. 
  Located in Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna is the only vast 
area of tropical forest in China. It covers an area of 19,000 
sq km. It also boasts one sixth of the species of seed plants 
and pteridophytes in China. In 1959 the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences set up the tropical botanical garden, the first of its 
kind in the country. 
  Because of human activities leading to deterioration of the 
environment, the tropical forests at Xishuangbanna have shrunk 
by 50 percent in the past five decades. Many species of plants 
are on the verge of extinction. 
  In 1984 the tropical botanical garden set aside 80 ha of 
land 
to cultivate the endangered species. After years of research 
and experimentation the garden has succeeded in cultivating 108 
species of endangered plants, including 46 species that were 
listed among the 53 major species of plants under state 
protection. 
  Many of these plants date back to the tertiary period and 
are 
considered as living fossils. 
  In order to better study and protect the endangered plants, 
the tropical botanical garden is preparing to set up a bank of 
seed genes of tropical plants.

  [Text] Fuzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Fujian Province, in 
southeast China, is boosting aquatic production to make up for 
its grain shortages. 
  Although boasting a 3,300-kilometer coastline, Fujian has 
few 
cultivated areas, averaging 0.033 hectares per capita. 
  The provincial government has taken the lead in the country 
in reforming its fishing system and lifted prices on aquatic 
products since 1990. 
  As a result, its aquatic products output reached 1,903 
million kilograms last year, ranking third in the country and 
averaging 60.5 kilograms per capita. 
  According to Zhang Wenliang, director of the provincial 
bureau of aquatic products, the output value of Fujian's 
fisheries will lead in Fujian's agricultural output value in the 
year 2010. 
  In addition to aquatic production, Fujian is paying 
attention 
to the development of deep-water fishing, offshore oil pumping, 
mining and tourism.

<F P=106> ["`Deepen Enterprise Reform, Strengthen Enterprise </F>
Management, and Vigorously Halt Losses and Increase Profits'; 
Chen Huanyou Gives An Important Speech at the Provincial 
Enterprise Conference"] 
  [Text] "Further implement the central authorities' `20- 
character' work guidelines, focus on deepening enterprise 
reform, bring the province's work on enterprises to a new stage, 
and consolidate and develop the excellent situation of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction." These are the 
guidelines stressed by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial 
party committee and governor, at the provincial conference on 
enterprise work. 
  The three-day conference closed in Zhenjiang yesterday. 
Early in the conference, Chen Biting, chairman of the 
provincial planning and economic commission, outlined 
arrangements on major tasks facing enterprises in the province 
today. Comrade Chen Hongchang, vice chairman of the provincial 
commission for restructuring the economy, explained why it was 
necessary to select 100 enterprises to experiment with modern 
enterprise systems. Comrade Zhu Tao, deputy secretary general 
of the State Economics and Trade Commission, made a special trip 
here for the conference. He also gave an important speech. Six 
enterprises briefed the conference on their experience. 
Participants spoke freely in the discussion. They put forward 
many good views and suggestions on ways to carry out experiments 
with modern enterprise systems, strengthen enterprise 
management, and halt losses and increase profits. Vice Governor 
Ji Yunshi and Secretary General Liu Jian attended the 
conference. Chen Huanyou gave an important speech at the 
closing session. 
  Chen Huanyou said: Since the beginning of this year, our 
province has earnestly implemented the guidelines of the 14th 
National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, followed the central guidelines of 
"seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability;" persisted in 
emancipating the mind; sought truth from facts; and worked 
actively and in a down-to-earth manner. As a result, reform and 
opening up have gradually deepened, the provincial economy has 
developed quickly, social and political stability has been 
maintained, and the situation in general has been good. 
Agriculture has also developed soundly, with summer ripening 
crops expecting a good harvest. The percentage of products sold 
has risen each month, and the adjustment of product mix has 
accelerated. Key project construction has been strengthened. 
Construction of a number of key projects selected by the state 
and the province has been stepped up according to plans. 
Necessary conditions have been acquired for the construction of 
the new Nanjing airport, the Jiangyin highway bridge spanning 
the Chang Jiang, and several other key projects. The financial 
situation has been fairly stable. Deposits and loans of 
different types with the province's banking institutions have 
increased. Reserves in specialized banks have risen. Since the 
implementation of the new foreign exchange system, foreign 
exchange rates have remained basically stable. The province has 
also actively carried out reform in finance, taxes, banking, 
investment, foreign trade, and other areas. Developments in the 
last four months and more have been generally sound. Enterprise 
reform, which centers on the establishment of modern enterprise 
systems, has gradually deepened, and the steps taken to change 
operating mechanism have further quickened. New steps have been 
taken in opening the province to the outside world. Foreign 
trade, foreign investment, and foreign economic work have all 
developed with a strong momentum. Good progress has been 
achieved in the construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park as 
the first-stage construction has officially begun. Now we must 
seize the opportunity, pluck up our spirits, work hard, and keep 
forging ahead to overcome difficulties and problems in our 
current economic life and ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the economy. 
  Chen Huanyou stressed: Jiangsu's economic development now 
faces a new situation. We must further deepen reform to promote 
economic development and invigorate enterprises on the basis of 
a new system through accelerating the transformation of 
enterprises' operating mechanisms and governments' functions. 
First of all, we must revolve attention around the 
transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, practically 
succeed in establishing a modern enterprise system at selective 
enterprises on a trial basis, strive to construct the framework 
of a standardized modern enterprise system in two to three 
years, accumulate experiences, and gradually make progress. We 
must promote a modern enterprise system at different enterprises 
in different ways. While paying attention to successfully 
establishing a modern enterprise system at selective enterprises 
on a trial basis, we must promote reform of all enterprises. In 
particular, we must successfully carry out various measures 
adopted earlier for reform of enterprises as well as the 
supportive measures for the introduction of a new enterprise 
system and for enterprises to converge with the new system; we 
must accelerate the transformation of enterprises' operating 
mechanisms; we must successfully fulfill various basic tasks 
designed to establish a modern enterprise system; we must make 
efforts along the course of establishing a modern enterprise 
system. First, in respect of the basis for enterprises' economic 
decisionmaking power, we must steadfastly implement the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing Large and 
Medium-Sized State Enterprises' Transformation of Operating 
Mechanisms." Second, in respect of the basis for property 
rights, we must appraise step by step the fixed assets and 
circulating funds of large and medium-sized enterprises to 
ascertain state-owned assets in Jiangsu this year. Enterprises 
whose conditions permit must do a good job of clarifying debts 
receivable and debts payable, strive to readjust the 
assets-liabilities ratio, and optimize their asset structure. 
Third, in respect of the basis for business accounting, we must 
implement the "general rule governing business accounting of 
enterprises" and the "accounting standards" in an all-around 
way, and establish and perfect an accounting system that meets 
international standards for enterprises to faciliate their 
smooth convergence with a modern enterprise system. The key to 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system lies in efforts 
to be made by the enterprises themselves. Now, all enterprises 
must greatly change their guiding ideology and working methods. 
They must change from the past pursuit for returns from 
preferential treatment to pursuit for returns from reform. 
Priority may be given to experiments with reform measures so 
long as they are conducive to invigorating enterprises and 
improving their quality. 
  Chen Huanyou pointed out: To meet the needs of the 
development of a socialist market economy, we must improve 
practical management of enterprises. We must continuously 
innovate, develop, and improve management of enterprises under 
the new situation, and make efforts to change our concepts and 
broaden our thinking. First, we must make the transformation of 
enterprises' operating mechanisms and management of enterprises 
mutually supportive and closely integrate the reform of 
enterprises with their management. Second, we must enable 
enterprises to continuously adapt themselves to market changes, 
to improve market predictions and management decisions, and to 
adopt advanced production and operation methods to consolidate 
and develop markets at home and abroad. Third, we must make 
technical advance suit the modernization of management. We must 
treat technology and managment as the two wheels for 
successfully running an enterprise and make the two promote each 
other. Fourth, our management of enterprises must coincide with 
the international economy. In particular, large and 
medium-sized enterprises whose conditions permit must gradually 
meet the needs of international competition, organize production 
and business operations on the basis of international practice, 
and acclerate convergence between management of enterprises and 
the international economy. To improve management of 
enterprises, we must focus attention on successful management of 
their cost and funds. We must strive to reduce their 
consumption of materials and their cost, and to increase their 
economic returns by every possible means. To solve the problem 
of funds shortage, besides requesting more funds from the higher 
authorities and attracting more foreign funds, we must, above 
all, turn our attention to enterprises themselves. We must 
begin with improving management, pay attention to successfully 
managing and using existing funds, stimulate the circulation of 
funds on hand, and improve the efficiency of the use of funds. 
We must arouse and organize the vast number of enterprises and, 
in particular, the large and medium-sized state enterpises to 
conscientiously conduct activities of "transforming operating 
mechanisms, paying close attention to management, improving 
internal operations, and increasing economic returns." Relevant 
departments must strengthen leadership over such activities, 
draw up good plans for implementation, and pay close attention 
to their implementation in a bid to promote Jiangsu's management 
of enterprises to a new level. 
  Chen Huanyou demanded: We must adopt concrete and 
effective measures to vigorously carry out the work of halting 
losses and increasing profits. This year, the province must 
achieve the target of reducing the number of money-losing 
state-owned industrial enterprises to 30 percent of the total 
and keeping the amount of the losses basically the same as last 
year. We must establish a system of responsibility, with every 
enterprise and every person having a clearly defined 
responsibility and with every level assuming responsibility for 
the next lower level. All localities and departments must soon 
organize a special task force and send it to money-losing 
enterprises to conduct a general survey and analysis to find out 
the causes of their losses. Appropriate guidance must be 
provided in light of the specific situation and with a clear 
objective in mind. Active measures must be adopted to reduce 
burdens on enterprises and ensure that they can compete in the 
market unhampered. We must make full use of the existing social 
security capacity and use the social security fund according to 
regulations. At the same time, we must step up the construction 
and perfection of a labor market to find a way out for workers 
who await jobs, who were laid off, or who lost their jobs. We 
must create more job opportunities for surplus enterprise 
personnel. We must adopt a variety of flexible asset management 
methods to enliven money-losing enterprises. We must encourage 
stronger enterprises to take over money-losing ones on a 
voluntary basis. We must continue to increase our experiment to 
let private sectors manage state- and public-owned enterprises 
and to lease them out. Small state-owned money-losing 
enterprises may be leased out, contracted out, sold, or managed 
in the form of a stockholding cooperative system. Those in 
downtown districts of cities may be retooled to operate tertiary 
industries. Enterprises that are still partly operational may 
be enlivened through the adoption of "multi-systems under one 
plant management" or through the reduction of accounting units. 
While accelerating internal enterprise reform, we must pay more 
attention to the changes and trends of the market. We must 
strengthen market survey and research, keep track of market 
demands, work hard to open up new markets, and increase our 
sales. We must take further steps to accelerate technological 
transformation, adjust product mixes, and firmly limit the 
manufacturing of goods that have no markets while reducing their 
stock through sales promotions. In the course of halting losses 
and increasing profits, we must make proper arrangements for the 
daily life of workers in difficult enterprises to ensure their 
basic livelihood. 
  Chen Huanyou emphatically concluded: We must step up 
changing government functions and create a favorable external 
environment for enterprise reform and development. Everyone in 
the province, from the top to the bottom, must make joint 
efforts with one mind to deepen reform, revitalize our vast 
number of enterprises, and play a bigger role in our province's 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 1550)] </F>
  [Text] Nanjing, 3 June (XINHUA) -- Secondary industry is 
being gradually shifted to rural areas while tertiary industry 
enjoys rapid development in urban areas. Such a new urban-rural 
relationship has become increasingly distinct in the 
economically developed cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou in 
Jiangsu Province. 
  Thanks to the spread of urban industries, village and town 
enterprises rose like a new force suddenly coming to the fore in 
the fields beside Tai Hu in the early 1970's. They opened a new 
chapter in the annals of industrial revolution in China's rural 
areas. After more than 20 years of pioneering work and 
development, southern Jiangsu's rural areas ended an era of 
"grass-roots industry" and entered into a new phase of 
industrial development with scientific and technological 
advances and the export-oriented economy playing the dominant 
role and with a rational distribution of village and town 
enterprises being relatively concentrated in satellite towns. 
At present, the three cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou 
boast 50,000-plus village and town enterprises. Over 70 percent 
of their equipment is of the advanced level of the 1980's and 
the 1990's, surpassing the technical and equipment standard of 
urban industries. On the average, every township and town set up 
more than 10 "three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises." According to statistics, staff and workers of 
village and town enterprises already accounted for over 80 
percent of the labor force in southern Jiangsu's rural areas. 
The ratio captured by village and town industries in the whole 
industrial sector of southern Jiangsu already exceeded two 
thirds. On the list of China's top 100 village and town 
enterprises made public recently, 45 are located in southern 
Jiangsu. 
  The successful process of industrialization in the 
countryside has filled the chasms that have chronically divided 
urban and rural areas. In southern Jiangsu, all townships and 
towns have been interconnected by highways, most of the villages 
are now illuminated by streetlamps at night, and the 
overwhelming majority of townships and towns have installed 
program-controlled telephones. On the basis of "feedback" from 
village and town industries, southern Jiangsu has initially 
realized farming mechanization, and more than 90 percent of the 
villages have set up general agricultural service stations. 
Fair-sized operations on land and socialized agricultural 
service networks have developed significantly, turning age-old 
heavy farm jobs, which peasants performed with "their faces 
turned toward the yellow soil and their backs toward the sky," 
into "pieces of cake." Various social services, including 
culture, education, and medical and health care, have all 
advanced side by side. The dream of urbanizing the countryside 
is slowly coming true. 
  The economic take-off in rural areas has posed endless 
challenges to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, setting even stricter 
demands for building up the multipurpose functions of key 
cities. Faced with this task, the cities in southern Jiangsu 
have aggressively reversed the old pattern of lopsided 
development in secondary and tertiary industries as they have 
begun implementing a new blueprint for giving modern cities a 
new lease on life. In recent years, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou 
cities have successively designated tertiary industry as a new 
economic growth sector to be developed on a priority basis. 
This will turn the cities into the hubs of manpower, material, 
capital, and information flows. Traditional commodity exchanges 
and catering businesses aside, such burgeoning tertiary 
businesses as finance, communications, post and 
telecommunications, scientific and technological consultation, 
and information media services are on the rise. New service 
industries, which are primarily of a knowledge-intensive type, 
have sprung up incessantly, breathing powerful life into urban 
economies, and lending strong support to the further development 
of rural economies. 
  People in economic circles commented: The shift of secondary 
industry to the countryside and the growth of tertiary industry 
in the cities have eroded the traditional notion of an 
"industrial city." This will blur the boundaries between urban 
and rural areas, bringing about a new pattern in which the 
integration of urban and rural economies is accelerated.

  [Text] The provincial work conference of town- and 
township-run collieries was held in Jinan on 4 June. In line 
with the provincial methods for implementing the state policies 
on supporting, transforming, consolidating, cooperatively 
developing, and upgrading town- and township-run collieries, the 
conference made a proposal for consolidating them. 
  It is reported that over the past years, our province has 
rapidly developed the local collieries. So far, 13 cities and 
prefectures and 35 counties, cities, and districts across the 
province have 592 local collieries of various categories at 
various levels, and these collieries have a capacity of turning 
out 17.85 million tonnes. Thus, local collieries have held up 
half of the province's coal industry. As an important component 
of the province's local coal industry, town- and township-run 
collieries turned out 10 million tonnes of coal last year, 
accounting for one seventh of the province's demand for coal. 
  Facing town- and township-run collieries' problems cropping 
up due to lax management, arbitrary mining and digging, tax 
evasion, poor conditions for safety in production, low 
disaster-combating capability, the occurrence of more accidents, 
and the overstepping of the bounds for mining, Chen Jianguo 
stressed: At a time of grasping the development of state-owned 
key collieries and state-owned local collieries, the provincial 
government has decided to comprehensively and thoroughly clear 
up and consolidate town- and township-run and collective-run 
enterprises so as to realistically solve their prominent 
problems.

  [Text] Jinan, June 4 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong 
Province had invested over 80 million U.S. dollars to set up 226 
enterprises in foreign countries and regions by the end of last 
year. 
  Scattered in nearly 50 countries and regions, these 
enterprises have expanded exports and obtained a great deal of 
overseas market information for the province. 
  At the beginning of the 1980s, some foreign trade companies 
first opened overseas agencies. Entering the 1990s, the 
province made a number of favorable policies to encourage the 
industrial companies to set up overseas agencies. 
  By now, many large enterprises, in the fields of chemicals, 
textiles, metallurgy, machinery, aquatic products and medicines, 
began to set up overseas agencies. The production enterprises 
make up 50 percent of the total overseas agencies. 
  These overseas agencies not only undertake trading, 
investment, information service, labor export, but also pool 
overseas capital to the province. 
  By establishing overseas branches and opening the 
international market, some giant enterprises of the province 
have become trans- national enterprise groups.

U.S. dollars, have been set up in the Yimeng Mountains area in 
east China's Shandong Province. 
  Most of the investors come from Hong Kong and Taiwan and 
some 
from European and North American countries. 
  One of the revolutionary bases of China and consisting of 
seven counties, the Yimeng Mountains area is economically 
backward compared with the coastal areas because of geographical 
reasons. 
  But it is rich in workers as well as agricultural and 
mineral 
products, such as peanuts, silk, chestnuts, walnuts, ginkgo, 
apples, pears, hawthorn, limestone, marble, diamonds, borax, 
gold, silver, copper and iron. 
  To attract more overseas investment, the province has poured 
a great amount of money into infrastructure construction in the 
area. 
  In recent years, the province has built a railway and a 
highway cutting through the mountain area. Program-controlled 
telephones have linked all the counties in the area with the 
national telecommunications system. 
  A local airport is also being expanded there.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The environmental 
quality at Shanghai's Xinhua Street area, notorious for 
industrial pollution, has been greatly improved thanks to a 
ten-year effort. 
  The 2.2-square-kilometer area in the western part of the 
city 
houses 110 plants involved in industrial chemicals, medicine, 
paper- making, metallurgy, machinery and electrical appliances, 
and meters and instruments, which discharge heavy pollutants, 
waste water and gas. 
  Since 1985, the municipal government has spent 450 million 
yuan in the treatment of pollution in this area, which has 
completed 407 pollution-treatment projects and removed, closed 
down or merged 25 plants and workshops discharging heavy 
pollutants. The municipality has also planted more trees, lawns 
and flowers. 
  As a result, the industrial output value of the area last 
year went up by 33 percent over 1985 and the amount of 
discharged waste gas was reduced by at least 70 percent and 
waste water by 50.7 percent. 
  Noise in the area does not exceed the municipal 
government-set standard at present.

  [Text] Hefei, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The Chang Jiang River 
Valley headed by Shanghai is leading in the national economic 
and scientific development. 
  With a total area of 330,000 square kilometers and a 
population of 170 million, the valley generates industrial 
output value accounting for one-third of the country's total, 
and its gross domestic product occupies one-fifth of the 
nation's total. 
  At present, Shanghai and Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, 
Hunan and Sichuan Provinces in the valley have worked out 
strategic development plans in line with local conditions while 
cooperating with each other in the development and utilization 
of natural resources and production factors. 
  Shanghai is being developed into an international metropolis 
featuring commerce, banking and foreign trade; Nanjing, capital 
of Jiangsu Province, has focused on chemical and electronics 
industries; Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, is being turned 
into a market; and Chongqing, Sichuan Province, is on line to 
become the economic center in southwest China. 
  According to preliminary statistics, areas in the valley 
have 
loaned and borrowed a sum of 231 billion yuan and traded one 
billion yuan worth of goods. 
  So far, the valley has formed five economic cooperative 
areas, which operate independently while maintaining links with 
each other.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is forcing the 
pace of developing itself into an international and trading 
center to lead the Chang Jiang river valley and the whole 
country in economic growth. 
  A municipal official said that this, China's largest 
metropolis has expanded the use of foreign investment from 
industries to banking, foreign trade, commerce, real estate 
trade, consultancy, information and other economic sectors over 
the past few years. 
  At present, Shanghai has economic and trade relations with 
180 countries and regions. Business people from more than 50 
countries and regions have invested in Shanghai, which houses 
branch institutions and representative offices of 90 of the 
world's top banking organizations. 
  While absorbing foreign funds, technology, natural resources 
and talented people, Shanghai exports capital, technology, 
natural resources and qualified people. 
  It also encourages its enterprises to set up businesses and 
companies overseas. 
  Last year saw the city make headway in investing overseas 
while importing a record amount of capital. 
  In addition to issuing stocks overseas and absorbing direct 
foreign investment, Shanghai has concluded 592 contracts on 
borrowing foreign loans worth of 511 million U.S. dollars. 
  As a result of exporting 200 million U.S. dollars-worth of 
technology items a year, the city has imported a total of three 
billion U.S. dollars-worth of technology items. 
  The city imports 13 billion yuan-worth of raw materials used 
for production from the international market each year. 
  So far, 2,260 financial organizations from other parts of 
the 
country and overseas have opened businesses and offices in 
Shanghai. 
  According to statistics, the total transactional volume of 
securities topped 500 billion yuan last year, that of foreign 
exchange climbed to 5.3 billion yuan, and interbank loans to 323 
billion yuan. 
  The 2,600 foreign-funded commercial offices are busily 
undertaking international business in shanghai, which hosts more 
than 100 international exhibitions and receives tens of 
thousands of business people from all corners of the world a 
year while sending hundreds of trading delegations abroad. 
  In addition, the import and export volume via the port of 
Shanghai amounted to a record of 30.9 billion U.S. dollars-worth 
last year. 
  A survey shows that shanghai's more than 1,000 enterprises 
and research institutions which are empowered to export their 
products and import their needs, and 4,000 foreign-funded 
enterprises that have already gone into operation are making 
great contributions to the city's foreign trade and economic 
relations. 
  To meet the demand on world markets, Shanghai has started 
reforming its systems of enterprise management, prices and 
marketing. It has set up a number of state markets in line with 
international conventions.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has set a 
record in approving the establishment of foreign-funded projects 
this year. 
  A survey shows that the country's largest economic center 
approved 1,612 contractual projects from 43 countries and 
regions in the first five months of this year, up three percent 
over the same period of last year. These projects involve 3.85 
billion U.S. dollars worth of investment commitments, up 11 
percent. 
  The number of projects solely funded by foreign investors 
during this period is double the figure of last year, according 
to the survey. 
  The city's industrial sector still takes the lead in 
attracting foreign investment, followed by real estate and 
public utilities. 
  The survey said that Hong Kong is the number one investor in 
this leading industrial center, with the United States second 
and Japan third. 
  By the end of may this year, the number of foreign-funded 
projects in the city had climbed to 8,551 from 50 countries and 
regions with combined investment commitments worth 17.55 billion 
U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> ["An Informant's Letter Leads to the Cracking of 11 Cases" </F>
(by reporter Zhu Kang (2612 1660)] 
  [Text] Acting on a letter from an anonymous informant, the 
tax prosecution office of the New Pudong District procuratorate 
recently uncovered 11 cases involving a total of over 500,000 
yuan in evaded taxes, of which more than 400,000 yuan has so far 
been recovered. 
  In mid-March, the office received a letter containing 
information about Xu Peide [1776 1014 1795], a worker of the 
Gaohua Engineering Company who was temporarily transferred to 
the job of port supervisor at another unit. Xu was accused of 
illegally operating a restaurant named Xiaosha in Gaoqiao for 
eight months; he opened the restaurant in April 1993 but applied 
for a business license only in December. Even after he began 
running the restaurant legally, Xu continued to evade taxes by 
issuing fake receipts. At the same time he secured a business 
license he also secured special receipts for traders at the 
Fengjing Shopping Mall. He then made use of the preferential 
tax break for the Fengjing Shopping Mall to write receipts for 
others who intended to evade taxes and charged them a 
"management fee." 
  Chen [7115], chief of the tax prosecution office's 
investigation team, went to Gaoqiao with his subordinates, Pan 
[3382] and Zhang [1728], to investigate the case and found some 
two dozen fake receipts written by Xu Peide. Later, they also 
discovered that Shen Wenhu [3088 2429 5706], a nonpermanent 
resident of Shanghai, had, by using receipts issued by a 
tax-free unit, evaded 10,000 yuan in taxes payable for a 100,000 
yuan project he contracted for at the Baohua Ready-Mixed 
Concrete Plant. That evening, Shen Wenhu's case was placed on 
file for investigation and prosecution. 
  Next, the public prosecutors learned that Xu Peide had 
collected 11 unused receipt booklets in less than one year after 
he opened the restaurant in April 1993. They took swift and 
fierce action against Xu. Xu first gave the names of six buyers 
of his fake receipts that evening, and disclosed two more names 
while under investigation. In the course of investigating the 
eight cases, the public prosecutors uncovered two more serious 
cases each involving over 50,000 yuan in evaded taxes.

<F P=106> ["Special report on the 45th anniversary of Shanghai's </F>
liberation" by reporter Zhang Zhiyuan (1728 5268 6678): "Having 
Sent 16 Satellites Into Space and Gone Through Four Stages From 
Scratch, Shanghai's Space Industry has Achieved World-Renowned 
Results"] 
  [Text] Starting from scratch, Shanghai's space industry 
has developed a complete research and development system for 
carrier rockets and artificial satellites. After carrying its 
first launch assignment with a large carrier rocket, Shanghai 
sent 16 artificial satellites into space on 13 occasions, either 
independently or through joint efforts, with a 100-percent 
success rate. This has stunned the world's space industry. 
  The first and second stages of the "Long March-3" rocket, 
which won a special state award, were developed by Shanghai's 
space industry base with the New China Machinery Plant -- the 
main assembly plant -- as the core. For several years after 
that, scientists, engineers, and technicians from the space 
industry base's 300-plus research departments, institutions of 
higher learning, and production enterprises dedicated themselves 
to the independent development of the large "Long March-4" 
carrier rocket of advanced world standards, as well as the new, 
two-stage liquid- propellant "Long March-2d" rocket. 
  Since the initial stage of large carrier rocket research and 
development, Shanghai's space industry base has leapfrogged 
through four stages. During the first stage, which began on 26 
July 1975, Shanghai designed and developed the "Windstorm-1" 
rocket with the support and assistance of other concerns at 
home, and then used it to send the "Sky-1" satellite into space. 
During the second stage, which began on 20 September 1981, 
Shanghai and other domestic concerns jointly completed our 
country's first assignment of launching three satellites into 
orbit on a single rocket. During the third stage, which began 
on 8 April 1984, Shanghai and other domestic concerns jointly 
sent our country's first geostationary experimental 
communications satellite into orbit on the "Long March-3" 
rocket. During the fourth stage, Shanghai splendidly 
accomplished the assignment of launching "Asiasat-1," the first 
foreign satellite launched by our country for commercial 
purposes. The satellite, which was manufactured by the 
U.S.-based Hughes Aircraft Company, was an "extraterrestrial 
visitor." Sent into space by a U.S. spacecraft in 1984, it 
could not enter the predetermined orbit due to engine trouble. 
Nine months later, it was retrieved by the mechanical arm of a 
U.S. spacecraft. The satellite immediately began communications 
and broadcasting services after it was successfully sent into 
orbit by the "Long March-3" rocket. 
  Toward the end of the sixties, Zhou Enlai, then-premier of 
the State Council, advanced the idea of developing space 
technology in the old industrial base of Shanghai, citing its 
strengths such as a sound industrial base, extensive academic 
disciplines, cooperation-friendly conditions, and a plethora of 
scientific research institutions. By now, Shanghai has trained 
and groomed a specialized technical corps capable of designing 
entire space vehicles and various subsystems, developed a 
complete research and development system for carrier rockets and 
artificial satellites, and established a space industry 
cooperation network comprising more than 300 institutions of 
higher learning, research departments, and factories. Moreover, 
Shanghai has installed testing apparatus and equipment of fairly 
large scale, such as rocket engine and cold-flow test beds. 
  Shanghai's space industry is converting its technological 
strengths into tremendous social and economic benefits. It has 
used its technology to build space-related systems, such as 
satellite television ground receiving systems and large radio 
and television acoustics systems, some of which have made their 
way onto the international market. Moreover, it has produced 
more than 1 million iceboxes for use in space.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
is the country's top province as far as environmental protection 
goes. 
  It tops the list when it comes to environmental quality, and 
its forest coverage rate is 46 percent, also one of the highest 
rates in China, according to an appraisal of environmental 
quality made by the ecologic research institute of the Chinese 
academy of sciences. 
  In recent years, with the development of township 
enterprises, environment pollution has increased accordingly, 
and the provincial government has formulated regulations to deal 
with the problem, according to a recent forum to mark world 
environment day sponsored by the provincial environment 
protection bureau. 
  For example, while promoting silkworm breeding and fruit 
production, the provincial government decreed regulations 
concerning fluorine pollution. In addition, to ensure the 
purity of the water used in making the famous local Shaoxing 
rice wine the provincial legislature enacted a set of 
regulations to protect Jianhu Lake. 
  The local government has also emphasized controlling the 
pollution caused by township enterprises engaged in printing, 
dyeing, tanning, chemical engineering and papermaking. 
  The province has set up various kinds of nature reserves and 
scenic resort areas to protect rare animals and plants, natural 
scenery, water, and cultural relics.

  [Text] China last night jammed transmission into the 
mainland of a controversial ATV documentary about the Tiananmen 
Square massacre. Instead, Guangdong viewers who normally 
receive Hong Kong TV, saw a concert by the pop star Sally Yeh. 
ATV Home viewers said an episode of the Justice Pao series was 
shown and then the graphics for the ATV documentary series News 
Magazine came up. The screen then went black and the concert 
started. 
  The documentary, mainly re-edited from old film taken by ATV 
in Beijing five years ago, provoked a row in Hong Kong last week 
when six of the station's senior staff quit after learning that 
management was refusing to show it. 
  The programme's host, assistant news controller Selina Li 
Yuk-lin, was one of those who resigned. She closed the show by 
saying: "Thanks for watching and thanks for your support."

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investors are 
keen on the construction of expressways in Guangdong, a 
flourishing province in south China. 
  Construction contracts involving 50.4 billion yuan (5.8 
billion U.S. dollars) have been drawn up between Guangdong and 
overseas investors since 1993, local officials said. 
  The overseas investment, which accounts for 61.9 percent of 
construction funding, comes from the United States, Brazil, 
Malaysia, France and Hong Kong. 
  Local officials said that the existing highways are far 
short 
of the economic boom. The daily flow of cars on most highways 
in the province surpasses 5,000, with some even reaching 10,000. 
  Under construction are expressways from Guangzhou, the 
capital city, to Zhuhai, a special economic zone, between the 
special economic zones of Shenzhen and Shantou, and along the 
coast from Yangjiang to Zhuhai. 
  Besides, Guangdong Province has already signed agreements of 
intent with overseas partners for the construction of the 
Guangdong section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Expressway and three 
other expressways. The projects are expected to be started next 
year and completed by 1998-99.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 4 (CNS) -- The Guangzhou Municipal 
Administrative Bureau and the Guangzhou Water Company signed 
letters of intent separately with foreign businessmen recently 
to sell some bridges, tunnels and 60 percent of stake in the 
water supply company for a 30-year term. [sentence as published] 
  This is for the first time for the transfer of stake in 
public utilities in China. [sentence as published] The letters 
of intent mainly stated that a business group would like to buy 
some public utilities in the municipality including the People's 
Bridge, the Haizhu Bridge, the Haiyin Bridge, the Guangzhou 
Bridge, the Pearl River Tunnel and 60 percent of stake in three 
water plants. The two sides would set up a cooperative company 
to run the four bridges, the tunnel and the three water plants. 
The foreign investor accounts for 60 percent of stake in the 
cooperative company and the Chinese side makes up the rest 40 
percent. The term is set for 30 years and the management would 
return to the municipality on expiry of the agreement. Economic 
return that the foreign investor would receive is put at 17.5 
percent from the municipal facilities and 17 percent from the 
water plants. 
  The cooperative company is considered a franchised entity 
and 
the charging rate for bridge and tunnel toll as well as for 
water rate is under the control of the municipal government. 
The foreign partner of the cooperative company will offer 
capital in accordance with its stake in the company to fund 
construction of three new bridges and a water plant. 
  The opening of municipal facilities to foreign businessmen 
for management is regarded as a breakthrough to raise capital. 
Such practice would help alleviate long-term shortages of 
capital for urban construction. Some persons are, however, 
convinced that inflation would be brought about because the 
basic expense for daily living has to increase as a result of 
commercialization of the public utilities. 
  A formal agreement on these items will be signed this month.

<F P=106> [By Billy Wong Wai-yuk and Beverly Chau in Longgang and </F>
Queenie Wang in Hong Kong] 
  [Text] More than a hundred workers are believed to be 
trapped in a mainland factory which collapsed yesterday, killing 
at least six people. Reports suggested that 200 people were 
sleeping in the five-storey building in Longgang, near Shenzhen, 
when it collapsed at 7.30 am -- and the death toll seems certain 
to rise today as rescuers delve further into the debris. 
  Hospitals said 63 people, mostly women aged between 15 and 
25, were injured in the tragedy. Nine were in a critical 
condition. Chinese officials claimed that the building, the Xie 
Cheng toy factory, was owned by a Hong Kong businessman known as 
Mr Wong. It had been built without permission, they said. 
  Last night reports said he had been arrested by Shenzhen 
police, although workers at the site maintained the owner was 
from Fujian. Local government spokesman Huang Xinhua said: "We 
have learned that the factory boss had not obtained permission 
to build and had not taken out insurance for the work. 
  "Workers, mostly women from the countryside, were sleeping 
in 
the building when the disaster occurred." The factory comprised 
about 2,000 square metres and was situated about 40 kilometres 
from Shenzhen, outside the Special Economic Zone. 
  Li Xiaogan, a spokesman for Shenzhen Municipal Government, 
said the rescue effort would continue overnight and into today. 
He said construction of the building began about two months 
ago. Three storeys had been completed and work had started on 
the remaining two. Most of the workers, believed to have come 
from Sichuan, Hunan, Henan and Anhui provinces, were given 
temporary accommodation on the first and second floors. As a 
result, said Mr Li, identification of the dead could take some 
time. 
  Shenzhen's mayor, Li You-wei, rushed to the scene to help 
organise the rescue effort as soon as details of the tragedy 
emerged. 
  Weeping eyewitness Deng Suo, 20, who was employed at the 
factory, recalled the fatal moment when she lost many of her 
friends and colleagues. "I heard a very big crash when I was 
waking up. I knew something terrible must have happened. I 
rushed out and saw the five-storey building collapse into 
rubble," she said. "I didn't know what to do. My friends were 
inside. We sent someone to call the police and did what we 
could to help." Deng Suo said there was so much chaos and heavy 
masonry that they were powerless to help. Some people were so 
distraught they just clasped each other and cried. 
  Another eyewitness, Deng Maoling, 19, said she felt the 
ground move when the building collapsed. "I felt the ground 
shake. I thought I was in a dream. When I realised what had 
actually happened, it was worse than a nightmare," she said. 
  The development originally comprised one five-storey block, 
accommodating more than 1,000 workers, she said. The ground 
floor was used as a factory and the upper four floors were 
dormitories. "The owner wanted to develop the business and was 
trying to employ more workers. So they started to build a new 
block two months ago. They moved more than 200 workers from the 
original block to the second floor of the new building which was 
still under construction," she said. 
  Deng Maoling said she had been waiting 10 hours to see if 
any of her friends would come out alive. She claimed she had 
counted many people, including six dead bodies, being brought 
out. "I'm sure many of them are still in the rubble," she added. 
  Victims were taken to Longgang County Number Two People's 
Hospital, the biggest in the area. An employee there said some 
were seriously injured, suffering broken arms and legs. One 
victim was seen in the casualty ward lying motionless on a 
stretcher with his head bandaged and bleeding profusely from the 
nose. Further eyewitness accounts were prevented by Public 
Security Bureau officials "acting on orders from above," who 
briefly detained reporters and confiscated film. 
  The accident is expected to renew debate over the safety of 
factories -- particularly those owned by Hong Kong entrepreneurs 
-- in China. Last November, 84 people died in a blaze which 
swept through a toy factory owned by a Hong Kong businessman in 
the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. The businessman, Lo 
Chiu-chuen, is currently in jail in China awaiting trial.

  [Text] A five-story factory building in Shenzhen City's 
Longgang District suddenly collapsed at 0730 yesterday, trapping 
106 workers who were staying in the factory dormitory on the 
second floor of the building beneath collapsed concrete ceilings. 
  After the collapse, the Longgang District Government 
immediately set up a rescue command center at the scene and 
organized members of the party, government, and Army to start a 
rescue operation with all their strength. Li Youwei, secretary 
of the Shenzhen city party committee and mayor, and other 
officials also rushed to the scene to attend to the operation. 
By the time this report was filed last night, a total of 63 
casualties had been hospitalized, of which 34 were still in the 
hospital, four had died, and nine were seriously injured. 
  It has been verified that this building belonged to the 
Jiecheng Plastic Factory, which is wholly owned by Hong Kong 
businessman Wang Chengen. The factory building had been built 
on a plot of reclaimed land, formerly part of a river bed, which 
had been filled with soft soil. The construction had been 
started hastily in the absence of any architectural plans, 
before any application had been lodged with the authorities, and 
before any legal examination and approval procedures had been 
completed. Both the steel frame and the beam and column 
concrete support structures were of inferior quality; the 
project's quality control was not up to standard; and the 
building had been put into use before all the construction work 
was completed. The rescue operation is still in full swing.

yuan in the construction of telecommunications. 
  Now the city has 88,000 automatically-controlled telephone 
lines and more than 5,000 mobile telephone users. 
  The rapid development of the service industry in the city 
has

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) has approved a 140-million-dollar loan to help two 
Chinese cities fight environmental pollution. 
  According to an official of the International Department of 
the People's Bank of China, ADB loans to China this year are 
expected to top 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, about the same as last 
year. 
  The 140-million-dollar loan will have a maturity term of 25 
years and carry an interest rate of 6.7 percent. 
  It will mainly be used to build gas facilities in Chengde 
and 
Tangshan, two cities in north China's Hubei Province which have 
long been plagued by air pollution caused by burning coal 
instead of gas. 
  Since China obtained ADB membership in 1986, it has received 
a total of 3 billion U.S. dollars' worth of loans from the 
organization, most of which have gone to projects in 
infrastructure construction, environmental protection and 
programs to relieve dire poverty.

  [Text] Washington, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Clinton has said: "We must regard our relations with China 
within the broader context of our interests in the Asia-Pacific 
region, of which America is an integral part." 
  Clinton made the statement in an article published in the 
LOS 
ANGELES TIMES on 31 May. Commenting on the reasons for 
extending the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status to China, 
Clinton said: "After many years' arguments and repetitive 
vetoes, we no longer implement two sets of policies toward China 
-- one set from the Congress and another from the President. 
Instead, we will implement a single American policy toward 
China." He added: "Linking human rights to the MFN has brought 
us to a dead end." 
  Clinton continued: "We will have more contacts, more trade, 
more international cooperation, and more extensive and regular 
dialogues on human rights issues with China." 
  Clinton believes that a 21st-century economy is taking shape 
in China. In 1993, China was the world's fastest growing 
economy. China is not only an enormous market for 
American-produced commodities, but has also provided 
opportunities for more jobs in America. China has a veto power 
in the United Nations Security Council and it is an important 
factor for Asian, and even global security. Clinton indicated: 
The United States and China share major interests in some 
fields. 
  He said in conclusion: "The actions I have taken on China 
suit the long-term interests of both the United States and 
China."

  [Text] Tokyo, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- During a meeting here 
today with Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation Wu Yi, Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said he 
hopes Japanese-Chinese friendly relations will always develop. 
  Hata said he was very glad to have met with President Jiang 
Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese leaders when he, in 
the capacity of foreign minister, accompanied former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on a trip to China not long ago. He 
believes that visit to China was of great significance. 
  Hata said that a member of his cabinet had made an improper 
appraisal of history after he assumed the post of prime 
minister, and that he had taken action to deal with it. 
  Hata said: According to statistics compiled by Japan, the 
volume of trade between the two countries topped $38.6 billion 
last year. Japanese investment in China also grew rapidly last 
year. He was glad to see this and hopes for further development 
in Japanese-Chinese economic relations and trade. 
  Wu Yi said: Given a push by Sino-Japanese friendly relations 
and cooperation, bilateral cooperative relations in trade and 
economics have shown a favorable trend of development and 
entered a new stage. She stressed: Separated only by a trip 
over water, China and Japan enjoy the favorable conditions of 
climatic, geographical, and human closeness. Friendly relations 
and cooperation between China and Japan are important to Asia 
and the world. 
  During her visit to Japan, Wu Yi met with Japanese Foreign 
Affairs Minister Koji Kakizawa. She also held talks with 
Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata to 
discuss the development of bilateral cooperative relations in 
trade and economics, bilateral textile trade, China's accession 
to GATT, and other issues. Eijiro Hata said Japan supports 
China's GATT entry. 
  Headed by Wu Yi, the delegation of the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation arrived in Japan on 31 
May for a goodwill visit at the invitation of Japan's Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry.

development, with over 4,000 new and high-tech enterprises now 
and a 40 percent annual growth rate in economic returns. 
  After the visit, Sihanouk wrote a few words to express his 
congratulations on China's achievements in national construction 
and scientific and technological development.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 3 KYODO -- China's paramount leader 
Deng Xiaoping has said the sky will not fall when he dies, a 
pro-China magazine reported Friday [3 June]. 
  The Chinese-language MIRROR said the 89-year-old Deng 
recently told members of his family "don't consider my 
individual contributions so important." 
  "Even when Chairman Mao died, the sky didn't 
fall...Outsiders 
say every day that I have died...That I am very ill. But the 
important thing is that the work must go on, that the economy 
must continue to develop," said Deng. 
  Deng recently advocated three principles, according to the 
MIRROR. "Firstly," Deng said, "economic construction should be 
the center of China's policy. Secondly, I advocate reform and 
the open door policy, and thirdly, development is the correct 
road." Deng added that it had already been proven that these 
three principles were correct and had the support of the people. 
  "This generation of leaders is now too old to solve them," 
the paramount leader reportedly said, adding "it is up to the 
third generation of leaders to address these issues."

<F P=106> [By Giles Hewitt] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--The Chinese authorities 
wrapped an all-embracing security blanket around Beijing on 
Friday [3 June] to avert any public incident on the eve of the 
fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In a 
clampdown unprecedented since martial law was imposed in 1989, 
the government flooded the capital with People's Armed Police 
(PAP) and plainclothes personnel, interrupted satellite 
television broadcasts and prohibited even the most 
innocuous-sounding gatherings. 
  Police roadblocks have been thrown up around the university 
area in the northwest of Beijing, preventing foreigners from 
approaching Beijing University -- one of the cradles of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement that was brutally suppressed by Chinese 
troops on June 4. The main entrance to Qinghua University was 
guarded by about a dozen uniformed security personnel, 
rigorously checking student identifications. 
  On Tiananmen Square itself, hundreds of plainclothes police 
-- easily recognisable by their dark glasses and two-way radios 
wrapped in copies of the People's Daily -- shadowed all 
foreigners and quickly broke up any gathering of more than five 
people. The square's Monument to the People's Heroes -- one of 
the focal points of the 1989 demonstrations -- was roped off and 
one Chinese who complained that he was not allowed to climb the 
monument's steps was quickly moved on. 
  Three journalists from the US television network CBS, who 
shot some film on the square Friday morning were detained by 
police and questioned for two hours. All their videotape was 
confiscated, one of the journalists said, adding that the police 
had accused them of filming without authorisation and shooting 
footage of the heavy security presence. 
  "I have never seen the security so tight for a Tiananmen 
anniversary," a Western diplomat said. "It only needs troops on 
the street and it would be like martial law in 1989," he said, 
adding that widespread discontent over inflation and corruption 
and a marked increase in dissident activity at the beginning of 
the year had fueled the authorities' anxiety. 
  While the normal complement of Chinese sight-seers and 
kite-flyers were in evidence on Tiananmen Square, others were 
clearly intimidated by the police presence. "We haven't 
received any order not to go to the square this evening, but I 
still won't go," said one Beijing worker. 
  With the country's leading activists either in prison or 
exiled to the provinces and abroad, the only open sign of 
dissent was provided by university professor Ding Zilin who 
began a two-day hunger strike Thursday to protest against the 
heavy police surveillance of her home. Ding and her husband 
Jiang Peikun began their hunger strike at 6:25 p.m., the time of 
the birth of their son Jiang Jielun, who was shot dead by 
Chinese troops on June 4, 1989. 
  Also Thursday, the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) 
ordered all the capital's major hotels to pull the plug on the 
US Cable News Network (CNN) until further notice. "The PSB 
declined to give any reason for their decision, but obviously 
it's because of June 4," said the public relations manager at a 
joint-venture hotel. CNN reception in the foreigners' compounds 
housing Beijing-based diplomats and journalists was repeatedly 
interrupted Friday whenever a China report was aired. 
  Under a PSB directive issued last week, any group wishing to 
hold a meeting of more than 20 people in a Beijing hotel must 
first get police permission. At least two business meetings in 
the Kempinski Hotel -- a Sino-German-South Korean joint venture 
-- had to be called off last week after failing to get approval 
from the PSB. 
  Newspaper listings showed a marked lack of cultural events 
on 
what is normally a socially active Friday night and at least one 
bar popular with foreigners and Chinese was pressured into 
closing for the evening. A planned showing of the 1993 Cannes 
Palme D'Or-winning Chinese film "Farewell to My Concubine" had 
to be cancelled because of a "power failure" -- the same reason 
given for the cancellation of a leaving party for a US 
journalist last weekend.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (CNS) -- Chinese Vice Premier, Mr. 
Zou Jiahua, speaking at a conference on price inspection 
nationwide, stressed that the curbing of inflation and 
price-hike was a matter of prime importance in the country and a 
long-term policy to be adhered to by the government in the 
future. 
  Mr. Zou held that stability of prices was an important 
condition for social and economic stability in the country. 
Despite of the weakened growth of prices in recent times, the 
controlling of inflation and the stabilizing of market and 
prices at present remained an important task for properly 
handling of relationships between reform, development and 
stability. 
  Talking on how to deal with the relationship between the 
intensifying of price reform and the strengthening of 
administration over prices, the vice premier refuted the concept 
that the price reform was but to leave prices open, and as long 
as prices were freed, the reform in this sector was completed 
and there was no need for the government to impose price 
control. He expounded that the price reform was to transform 
the old price-formulating mechanism to one with the market force 
as its core, to streamline the price system to one able to 
reasonably dispose resources and to change the traditional price 
management system to one for controlling and regulating prices 
in which the government only played an indirect role. In order 
to realize this goal, measures of regulating, opening and 
controlling prices should be adopted simultaneously. Mr. Zou 
added that, even if the price reform was completed, the state 
would still administer prices in various forms of commodities 
which were monopolized by the state and of service businesses. 
Such practice had been very popular actually in many developed 
countries where market economy has been in operation. 
  In order to give more impetus to the campaign of the price 
inspection in the country, the working group in charge of the 
inspection campaign under the State Council would in mid-June 
again go to various provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities to supervise and guide this work and carry out 
the plan drawn up at the conference.

  [Text] Fuzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Rural industry in 
southeast China's Fujian Province generated an output value 
totalling 48.387 billion yuan in the first four months of this 
year, up 105 percent over the same period of last year. 
  Starting later than other setups, the province's rural 
industry has developed faster with rises in gross output value 
from 900 million yuan in 1978 to 54.4 billion yuan in 1992 and 
105.6 billion yuan last year. 
  At present, Fujian has more than 600,000 rural industrial 
enterprises, over 700 rural industrial parks and about 100 rural 
enterprise groups. 
  Last year saw the province approve the establishment of 
4,300 
overseas-funded enterprises involving a total contractual 
overseas investment of 3.6 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The 6,500 export-oriented rural industrial enterprises 
provided foreign trade departments with 19 billion yuan worth of 
goods last year. 
  In addition, rural industrial enterprises have set up at 
least 30 businesses overseas.

  Known as a seaside resort, Xiamen has allocated its island, 
mainland and suburbs different industries for attracting 
overseas investment, so as to attain simultaneous development of 
economy and environment. 
  The city is now a major attraction for overseas investment 
and for Chinese and foreign tourists. Its air pollution is 
under control and its water quality is among the country's best.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The labor markets in 
north China's port city of Tianjin are playing an increasingly 
important role in employment and personnel exchange through free 
choice. 
  Chinese workers used to be assigned jobs solely through the 
government labor departments. 
  But in recent years, with the number of foreign-funded, 
private and co-operative enterprises increasing, the need for a 
fluid labor market has been felt keenly. In the meantime, large 
numbers of surplus workers in state-run enterprises are waiting 
to be re-employed. 
  The first Tianjin labor market was set up on November 30, 
1992 under the supervision of the municipal labor department. 
  So far 600,000 workers have applied with the labor markets 
for new jobs, and 20 percent have been lucky. 
  Now labor markets have been set up in 18 city districts and 
suburban counties, catering to 12 professions. Furthermore, 
over 100 state-run enterprises have also set up their own labor 
markets. 
  A computer network links the various labor markets 
exchanging 
labor supply and demand information. 
  The Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau has also set up a special 
section to provide a continuous line of service: giving 
information, connecting demand and supply, exchange personal 
documents, signing contracts and providing unemployment security. 
  The labor markets are welcomed by both enterprises and job 
seekers. 
  A Sino-Japanese joint-venture electric machinery company was 
set up April this year in Tianjin, as the biggest Japanese 
company in Tianjin. Its over 1,000 employees were all recruited 
through the local labor markets. 
  Tianjin plans to connect its labor markets with those in 
other big cities like Beijing and Shanghai through a computer 
network to enhance labor exchanges.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou has 
established a commodities reserve system and funds for covering 
price-related risks in a bid to maintain the local market 
stability, according to a city government official. 
  Since November 1993, Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong 
Province, a rising economic giant in south China, has used the 
reserve system for major commodities to regulate the market, he 
said. 
  Now the system covers a variety of commodities, including 
pork, food grain, cooking oil, sugar, frozen fish, eggs, 
chemical fertilizers, pesticides and farming-related plastic 
sheets. 
  The city government has spent about 100 million yuan keeping 
these commodities in stock, the official said. 
  The city government has also raised nearly 120 million yuan 
for the establishment of regulatory funds covering risks related 
to grain prices, he added. 
  It has decided to spend 20 million yuan this year to 
subsidize vegetable production, he revealed. 
  "The reserves of staple commodities have proved effective in 
stabilizing the market and curbing excessive rises in prices," 
he said. 
  For example, last year state-owned grain stores in Guangzhou 
succeeded in bringing grain prices down by selling grain in 
large quantities. 
  In mid-February this year, the city government cut wholesale 
pork prices twice and increased pork supplies, thus pushing pork 
prices down. 
  Guangzhou's retail sales amounted to 11.3 billion yuan in 
the 
first four months of 1994, up nearly 26 percent over the same 
period in 1993, the official said. 
  Its price index rose about 18 percent during that period, 
lower than the nation's average, he added.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 2 (CNS) -- According to the 
Bulletin of Environmental Protection, environmental pollution in 
Guangzhou is by and large under control. However, measures 
curbing pollution in the city are still inadequate, in view of 
the growth of pollution. 
  Though industrial pollution is initially under control, 
environmental pollution is still rather serious. For instance, 
organic contamination in the water of the Guangzhou part of the 
Pearl River is getting worse. Disposal of urban refuse is still 
a headache. Harmful industrial rubbish has not yet been all 
collected together to be disposed of. Growth of the number of 
motor vehicles is too fast, and their exhaust gas pollutes the 
air. Noise pollution along the sides of main traffic lines 
remains high. Environmental administration over the tertiary 
industry is lagging behind its development. Urban residents are 
seriously suffering from waste water, waste gas and noise caused 
by the food industry there. Some enterprises are still shifting 
their responsibility of curbing their own pollution to society, 
aiming at making profit at the expense of people there. 
  According to an official from the Guangzhou Municipal 
Environmental Protection Committee, Guangzhou would be built 
into a metropolis of international standard in five years time, 
and 1994 is a crucial year for the realization of the goal. 
Protection of the environment must keep up with the development 
of economy. The plan for the protection of environment must be 
worked out in conformity with the total urban construction plan 
and the plan of municipal economic development. Departments of 
Urban construction, municipal administration, environmental 
protection and public utilities must take effective measures to 
speed up construction of projects for disposal of waste water 
and urban refuse, strengthen administration over and harness 
motor vehicles' exhaust gas, strengthen supervision over 
environment of food industries and control motor vehicles' noise 
pollution so as to improve environment for people's living. At 
the same time, Guangzhou municipality will further improve its 
laws and regulations on environment, endeavor to make publicity 
of the importance of environmental protection so as to enhance 
people's understanding of environmental protection.

  [Excerpts] Professor Fei Xiaotong, vice chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and [words 
indistinct] concluded his visit to our province yesterday. He 
arrived in our province on 14 May. He conducted conscientious 
and thoroughgoing investigations in localities such as Xinyang, 
Nanyang, and Zhoukou on such issues as rural economic 
development, its status in the country's economy, the current 
situation of the rural economy, and how to increase the 
peasants' income as soon as possible. 
  Yesterday afternoon, despite many claims on his time, Li 
Changchun, secretary of the provincial party committee, met with 
Professor Fei Xiaotong and exchanged views with the latter on 
Henan's economic development. Professor Fei said: Henan enjoys 
exceptional advantages in the coal, water, electricity, and 
transport sectors. It has abundant labor and [words 
indistinct]. If the creativity, civilization, and enthusiasm of 
the masses of people are brought into play and labor and natural 
resources are fully employed, the province's potential will be 
turned into economic strength very quickly. [passage omitted] 
  We must start with whatever things can benefit the peasants 
at present and try every possible means to increase their 
income. With their income increased, the peasants will have 
greater purchasing power. Hence, there will be a big market. 
The professor maintained: The 1980's were a period of rural 
industrialization and the 1990's are a period of rural 
urbanization. [passage omitted] 
  Secretary Li Changchun thanked the revered Comrade Fei for 
his concern for Henan's development and invited the latter to 
continue [words indistinct] to help Henan develop its economy. 
The professor received the invitation elatedly and agreed with

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Comment and Analysis of President Clinton's </F>
Announcement on Renewing Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Status to 
Mainland China"] 
  [Text] President Clinton officially announced yesterday 
that the U.S. Government would extend MFN trading status to 
mainland China in order to comprehensively improve relations 
with Communist China. Clinton conceded that Communist China had 
made some progress in the human rights situation on the 
mainland, but was still far behind Washington's demand for 
overall significant progress; however, to develop "a larger and 
more productive framework of relationship" with Communist China, 
he decided to no longer "link" the human rights issue with trade 
with the mainland. Hence, the long-clamored question of whether 
the United States should continue MFN status to Mainland China 
is now settled. 
  Though Clinton also announced, in passing, the decision to 
ban imports of Mainland Chinese-made ammunitions, this cannot 
serve a punitive or warning purpose for Communist China in view 
of current U.S. public opinion's strong opposition to the 
rampant privately-owned weapons in the country. Furthermore, 
ammunitions accounted for only a tiny fraction of the mainland's 
trade with the United States, which also bans imports of 
ammunitions from European countries. Therefore, as a U.S. 
congressman put it, Clinton's decision is tantamount to an 
unconditional renewal of the MFN trading status for the mainland 
as well as an open retreat from the human rights condition he 
insisted on during his election campaign and in an executive 
order last year. For this reason, though there had been signs 
of the Clinton administration's pending renewal of MFN, people 
were mildly surprised by the content of the announcement. No 
wonder there have been wide-ranging reactions from the Capitol 
Hill and mass media. 
  In fact, even though he was clearly aware of an inevitable 
wave of uproar from the Congress, President Clinton still made 
the decision, which cannot be easily justified. This indicates 
that Washington, after a thorough assessment, ascertained that a 
practical policy toward Mainland China would be more in line 
with the U.S. national interests. Why? On the one hand, U.S. 
entrepreneurs, having placed high expections on the mainland's 
market potential, were strongly opposed to any government 
measure that would undermine trade with Communist China. On the 
other hand, the strategy to link trade with human rights was 
obviously a self-contradictory one. 
  In countries entirely dependent on U.S. economic aid, this 
strategy may yield some results. However, in those which have 
developed mutually beneficial and interdependent trade and 
economic relations with the United States, the strategy of 
"carrot and stick" could easily be associated with and referred 
to as an expression of U.S. hegemonism; and hence, can be devoid 
of moral persuasive and practical deterrent powers. It goes 
without saying that human rights symbolize "universal" 
principles of values while bilateral trade and economic 
relations concern each other's "specific" interests. These two 
are not issues belonging to the same category. By forcibly 
mixing them together, the consequences would be either a serious 
collision between the two sides, or retreat from the strategy 
and admission of its failure at an opportune time after the 
other side responded in an appropriate manner. 
  The results are now barred. The Clinton administration opted 
for the latter. From the perspective of idealism and 
humantarianism, the decision on MFN renewal is indeed clear 
proof of the failure on the part of the United States to live up 
to its moral standards; however, based on the concepts of 
peaceful coexistence, mutually beneficial trade and economic 
relations, and the geo-economy -- ideas that have guided the 
international situation in the post-Cold War era -- Washington's 
decision is not at all difficult to understand. At any rate, 
however, the announcement on MFN renewal is tantamount to 
declaring that the Clinton administration has changed its "Cold 
Peace" tactics of relaxing one minute and tightening up the next 
and of interweaving with contradictions -- tactics which the 
United States had at one point adopted in viewing Communist 
China as its chief imaginary enemy since the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union -- and has entered a pragmatic era of facing 
Mainland China squarely as one of its important trading partners. 
  Washington's change of attitude was prompted primarily by 
the 
impressive progress in Mainland China's economic development in 
the past nearly three years. Although the mainland will not 
necessarily become the world's largest "unified market" at the 
beginning of the next century as some authoritative economic 
research institutes have predicted, its economic growth rate and 
development potential cannot be ignored. U.S. State Department 
officials repeatedly pointed out: While Germany, France, Japan, 
and other economic powers are trying hard to gain market shares 
in the mainland, and in the wake of numerous investment and 
cooperation agreements signed after visits to Peking [Beijing] 
by these countries' top-level economic delegations led by their 
premiers, it was absolutely impossible for the United States, 
for the sake of its economic and trade interests, to "exclude 
itself from the mainland's markets." In this way, the State 
Department officials simply pointed out the real reason behind 
Washington's MFN renewal to the mainland. Moreover, as far as 
strategy is concerned, the United States needed to prevent a 
renewed alliance between Russia and Communist China as well as 
to coordinate with Communist China to exert pressure on North 
Korea to defuse the nuclear crisis in Northeast Asia. For this 
reason, how could the United States continue to maintain its 
tough posture? 
  It is noteworthy that originally the United States wanted 
to maintain its "Cold Peace" tactics and to wait and see what 
would happen in the "post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping]" 
mainland. If, by that time, the mainland remained stable and 
its economy developed smoothly, the United States, to take part 
in and lead the Asian-Pacific economic rim to seek hefty 
commercial interests, would definitely try harder to accommodate 
Communist China. If the mainland were to become turbulent and 
communist Chinese leaders lose the ability to control the 
political situation, Washington would go all out to deal with 
Mainland China as it had with Russia, by launching 
"dismemberment" tactics to eliminate a potential rival of the 
United States. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration, after 
viewing comprehensive assessments prepared by the State 
Department, the Pentagon, and the Central Intelligence Agency, 
tended to believe that the "post-Teng" mainland would not 
necessarily see turmoil; moreover, a stable mainland at that 
time could be more useful to the United States. Therefore, the 
decision on MFN renewal also vaguely contains the results of 
Washington's study and assessment of the future situation on the 
mainland as well as its policy based on the study and 
assessment. In light of this, it is not difficult to understand 
that immediately after Clinton announced the MFN decision, 
Undersecretary of State Lord declared that the United States had 
no intention whatsoever of "playing the Taiwan card" to contain 
Communist China. 
  We believe that the U.S. MFN renewal for Mainland China is 
conducive to the mainland's economic stability and improvement 
of the people's livelihood, as well as to the prosperity of the 
"Chinese economic sphere" of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and 
Malaysia, which have closer economic exchanges with the 
mainland; and therefore, the MFN renewal is a practical 
decision. However, this does not mean that Communist China can 
turn a deaf ear to improvement of the human rights situation in 
the mainland. After all, this question has already attracted 
the international community's keen attention and Communist China 
has no reason to ignore this question even after obtaining MFN 
status, because not only will the United States continue to 
monitor closely the progress of human rights improvement, but 
this is also a matter involving the values of civilization and 
the dignity of the Chinese people.

  [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic 
Affairs Friday [3 Jun] unveiled a white paper outlining the 
country's industrial policy for the next 10 years. 
  It was the first time the ministry published a white paper 
detailing the country's industrial growth targets. 
  According to the paper, Taiwan's industrial production is 
expected to reach US$320 billion by 2002, with the annual growth 
rate set at 6 percent. This is nearly double the current 
production of about US$188 billion. 
  The paper said the "brain industry" will be the mainstay of 
future world industry, with "knowledge-intensive" products 
dominating the merchandise market. 
  The ministry will thus give priority to encouraging 
development of high-technology, high value-added and 
high-quality products, the paper said. 
  It noted that the textile industry will continue to boast 
the 
top production value at the turn of the century, but the 
information industry will be the fastest growing sector. 
  By 2002, Taiwan's annual textile output will reach US$34.6 
billion, while its information industry production will hit 
US$25 billion. 
  The annual growth target for technology-intensive industries 
is set at 9.5 percent for the next 10 years. They will be the 
driving force behind Taiwan's future economic development, the 
paper said. 
  In addition to the information industry, the paper said, the 
machinery, vehicle, consumer electronics, pharmaceutical and 
petrochemical industries also have great development potential. 
  Traditional labor-intensive industries like textiles and 
footwear are expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent 
over the next decade. 
  Machinery output will grow by 1.5-fold to hit US$25.6 
billion 
by the turn of the century, while petrochemical production is 
expected to reach US$23 billion. The paper said Taiwan's 
petrochemical output will be able to satisfy 74 percent of its 
annual market demand by 2002, compared with the current less 
than 60 percent.

  [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- Visiting Niger President 
Mahamane Ousmane said he is interested in agricultural 
cooperation with Taiwan during a visit to the Council of 
Agriculture (COA) Friday [3 Jun] morning. 
  Ousmane said he hoped Taiwan can assist Niger in developing 
agricultural technology to promote the economic development and 
improve people's living standard in his country. 
  Accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, Ousmane 
was 
received by COA Vice Chairman Wu Tong-chuan and heard a briefing 
from Wu. 
  Ousmane is especially interested in Taiwan's cultivation of 
sugar cane and fruits, preservation of water and soil resources, 
and agricultural budget as well as the small-farm system which 
Taiwan is developing. 
  Taiwan began to offer agricultural and medical assistance to 
Niger two years ago to teach people there how to improve 
planting of agricultural products. Ousmane also said he hoped 
Taiwan can assist Niger in developing technology and education 
in the future. 
  Earlier in the morning, Ousmane visited the Government 
Information Office (GIO) and viewed the multimedia introduction 
to the Republic of China [ROC]. He said he is impressed with 
the vitality and spirit seen in Taiwan. 
  Ousmane said that the ROC should be allowed participation in 
the United Nations and other international organizations. He 
added that his visit aims to reaffirm Niger's support of the 
ROC's UN bid. 
  Niger resumed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1992. Ousmane 
is the first Niger president to visit Taipei. He was elected to 
lead the West inland African country in 1993. 
  Ousmane arrived here Thursday for a six-day visit. He is 
accompanied by Niger's Foreign and Cooperation Minister 
Abdourahamane Hama, Trade, Transportation and Tourism Minister 
Souley Abdoulaye, and other ranking officials.

  [Text] China yesterday dismissed the controversy about a 
human rights commission and freedom of information legislation 
as irrelevant. 
  Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the Hong Kong branch 
of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), said Hong Kong people 
already enjoyed "all kinds of freedom and their human rights are 
well safeguarded". 
  "In the Basic Law, their freedoms and human rights are 
protected," he said. 
  "There is a whole chapter in the mini-constitution which 
spells out clause by clause the fundamental rights and duties of 
Hong Kong residents. It also stipulates that provisions in 
three international conventions as applied in Hong Kong will 
remain in force after China takes over. 
  "So it does not matter whether we support or oppose the 
idea, 
the fact is that it is completely unnecessary to set up such a 
human rights commission again.... If the commission was to be 
set up, we've made it clear that it will be dismantled after 
1997." 
  Zhang was responding to reports that the Government has 
turned down measures to set up a human rights commission and 
increase freedom of information because it fears upsetting China. 
  The Government is today expected to announce a compromise 
package of other anti-discrimination measures including an equal 
opportunities commission and a United Nations convention to 
protect women's rights. 
  The Chief Secretary, Anson Chan, said yesterday that the 
Government was fully committed to protecting human rights but 
there had to be some measures that were "durable". 
  "What we want to do in the coming weeks and months is to 
give 
careful consideration to the next steps that we should take to 
strengthen human rights and will have the opportunity of 
continuing both now and after 1997," Chan said.

<F P=106> [Article by Chan Wai-fong and Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] When followers of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support 
of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China assemble in 
Victoria Park tomorrow night for the annual June 4th 
candle-light vigil, they will not just be there to mourn those 
killed five years ago at Tiananmen Square. 
  They might also be witnessing the closing chapters of the 
story of the Alliance. 
  Tough-talking by Beijing officials and last week's scuffles 
between Alliance members and Hong Kong police outside the Xinhua 
headquarters in Happy Valley have left people with little doubt 
that the Alliance, already branded "subversive" by Beijing, will 
not be allowed to survive after 1997. 
  Formed in 1989 at the height of the democracy movement, the 
Alliance -- an umbrella organisation with 222 member subgroups 
-- is the largest political organisation in Hong Kong dedicated 
to the promotion of democracy in China. 
  In the past five years, it has consistently condemned 
political prosecution and called for the release of political 
prisoners in China. Every year, its schedule is filled with 
events to remind forgetful people in Hong Kong of those sad days 
in 1989 and of mainland activists in jail for taking part in the 
movement. At an information centre set up by the Alliance, news 
clippings, books, journals 'and video tapes are freely available 
to anyone interested in learning more about the democracy 
movement. 
  Apart from all these activities the Alliance has been acting 
discreetly behind the scenes. Dozens of mainland dissidents 
have been smuggled out of China with its assistance. Many have 
been granted asylum and have settled in the West. It also 
maintains an extensive communications network with dissidents in 
the mainland who have been forced underground by the authorities. 
  But when the soldiers from the People's Liberation Army 
march 
across the Shenzhen River at midnight on June 30, 1997, all 
these contacts may come to an end. 
  Although they won't admit it in public, many of the Alliance 
leaders are prepared -- at least psychologically -- for the 
grand finale. Its financial reserve which stood at about HK$5.7 
million [Hong Kong dollars] by last April can be depleted by 
1997. 
  "We have paid the price for doing all these things," said 
liberal legislator Cheung Man-kwong, who is a member of the 
Alliance's standing committee. "(Those in the Legislative 
Council) will have to step down in 1997...It is our conviction 
that the crackdown will one day be rehabilitated." 
  At present, seven of the 20 standing committee members of 
the 
Alliance are Legislative Councillors. Since there will be no 
"through-train" for the council in 1997, their membership of the 
Alliance will not affect their chances of serving beyond the 
handover. It will, ironically, probably help boost their image 
to help them win seats in the 1995 elections. 
  While it is obvious that the days of the Alliance are 
numbered, there is little indication of what its leaders are 
preparing to do in the final count-down. 
  Veteran activist Lau Shan-ching, who spent 10 years in a 
Chinese jail for his political views, believes the Alliance 
might have to shut down its underground operation and act 
strictly according to the law. 
  "I think the Alliance may have to stop activities like 
smuggling dissidents out of China that can be considered illegal 
after 1997," said Mr Lau who is also a member of the standing 
committee. "Although we will stand firm on our principles, we 
can't afford to give them an excuse to disband us." 
  The activist, often criticised for his radical political 
views, warned that the 1997 deadline could prove more 
unpredictable than most people expect if the future Special 
Administrative Region government handles it poorly. 
  "There will be demonstrations on July 1, 1997...but I don't 
expect the Alliance will play a leading role. 
  Its (the Alliance's) leadership is kind of conservative," Mr 
Lau said. 
  He also feared that if the Alliance was disbanded by the 
future SAR government its followers would be driven into forming 
"radical political groups" resulting in chaos in the streets. 
  "They (the SAR government) will have to go to court if they 
are to disband us. If that happens, I am not sure that they 
will win," he said. 
  His biggest criticism of the Alliance was that it has failed 
to offer its followers a clear political direction on China and 
has done very little in counteracting the psychological warfare 
launched by Beijing after the 1989 crackdown. 
  While he acknowledged the Alliance had promoted concepts 
such 
as press freedom and right of assembly among its followers, it 
had failed to "educate" them about "falsehoods" propagated by 
the communist party. 
  "I think it is not enough just to call for the 
rehabilitation 
of June 4 The Alliance has to point out more forcibly that all 
these problems China is facing today are in one way or another 
because of the crackdown. People are beginning to agree with 
them [communists] that the crackdown was justified as the 
economy is booming and the situation in China is stable. But 
that's not true, he said. 
  "We must point out that the Communist Party has lost its 
ideology. It is bound to fall apart after Deng Xiaoping dies. 
That's what the Alliance has failed to do. 
  "Without a clear message, we will lose our support." 
  Mr Cheung dismissed the suggestion that public support for 
the Alliance was fading although less people were taking part in 
its organised activities. 
  "Who still goes to Xinhua to protest these days? The heat 
has died down. We cannot attract the media any more. News of 
our activities has been placed far down the page in newspapers. 
But it's exactly because of these things that there is a need 
to go shouting against these abuses. It's easy to forget. Once 
people forget the pressure (on the Chinese Government) would 
also be reduced," he said. 
  Looking forward, Mr Cheung said with many dissidents now 
either in hiding or exile, the Alliance would concentrate on 
lesser-known activists in prison, like Shanghai dissident Yang 
Zhou. 
  "We will fight till the last minute. Even though it's the 
last minute should we not fight then?" Mr Cheung said. 
  "Don't underestimate the silence at the moment. A large 
number of the people who have witnessed the bloody crackdown 
still live. And no one could forget the Nanjing massacre," a 
reference to the 1937 massacre by the invading Japanese army. 
  If the Alliance survives after 1997, Mr Lau said, it would 
be 
the first group of political activists to organise memorial 
activities on June 4 in land ruled by China.

  [Text] Chongqing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
Chongqing City Government recently allocated special funds for 
the establishment of a major commodities reserve grain and 
nonstaple food risk fund system in a bid to stabilize the market 
supply of vegetables, grain, and edible oils, which are closely 
related to the livelihood of residents. 
  It is thought that major commodities to be reserved 
throughout the year will include grain, vegetable oil, pork, 
sugar, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, coal for civilian use, 
clothing material, and cotton. In case fluctuations in market 
supply occur in the future, the government will sell reserved 
commodities to curb price rises. 
  The Chongqing City government has put aside 10 million yuan 
as a risk fund for grain and 7 million yuan as a risk fund for 
nonstaple foods. These funds will be used to make up for price 
differences and other costs to curb market prices of grain and 
edible oils. During slack seasons, major festivals, and at times 
when market prices fluctuate greatly, the funds will also be 
used to organize supplies and to make up for price differences 
and other costs of curbing market prices.

  [Excerpt] Beijing has deployed the air force to water 
fields and seed clouds in southeast Sichuan, which is facing its 
worst drought in memory. 
  Violent disputes have broken out in the worst-hit counties 
of 
Ybin, Neijiang and Zigong as peasants defend their functioning 
wells against raids from neighbouring villages according to Chen 
Zihua, the head of Sichuan's disaster relief office. "We 
immediately sent cadres to deal with the situations," he told 
Eastern Express. 
  The first People's Liberation Army A-326 emergency aircraft 
flew into Chengdu military region airspace yesterday to begin 
operations, Chen said. 
  More than 8 million people were short of drinking water as a 
result of the freak drought, which began in early May. Convoys 
of fire trucks and liquid cargo carriers began transporting 
large volumes of drinking water to people in affected areas on 
Tuesday, he said. 
  Water pumps and well drilling equipment have been sent to 
areas inaccessible by vehicle or too far from available water 
supplies, under an operation mounted by the provincial 
agricultural producer goods bureau. 
  There were no reports of deaths and the situation had been 
ameliorated by the measures taken, Chen said, adding that there 
were no plans to move people away from affected areas, a measure 
that Beijing municipal authorities were forced to take in late 
March after the city had its worst drought in a century. 
  Sichuan authorities fear that trying to move part of the 
affected population, which stands at 18.4 million people in 22 
counties and cities, could be impracticable and cause further 
unrest. Chen said the province's main cities of Chengdu and 
Chongqing were not short of water. 
  Residents of Chengdu said last night that heavy rain had 
fallen in the afternoon, and further showers were expected today. 
  The Sichuan vice-governor Zhang Zhongxin, has called for 
more 
help from Beijing, which has so far agreed to provide only 1.5 
million renminbi (HK$1.3m [Hong Kong dollars]) in relief funds. 
  The provincial and local governments agreed to pool together 
Rmb120m [renminbi] for their effort in two emergency meetings 
held on Saturday and Tuesday, Chen said. 
  "The State Council only became very concerned about our 
situation after we reported to them on the seriousness of the 
conditions," he said. 
  Drought is rare in the affected parts of Sichuan, but 
rainfall in the Sichuan basin during May was 80 per cent below 
the average of recent years. Chen said the figure was 20 per 
cent below the province's last "great drought" in 1969. 
Scorching temperatures and above-average hours of sunlight have 
also been blamed. 
  While the province's massive grain harvest has already been 
gathered and sold, summer crops such as corn and rice were 
expected to suffer. "The provincial economy will definitely be 
affected," Chen said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, chairman of the CPPCC </F>
Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, at the closing meeting 
of the Second session of the Sixth Tibet Regional Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) 
on 21 May 1994] 
  [Text] Fellow members, comrades: 
  The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Regional CPPCC 
Committee has successfully completed various tasks according to 
its agenda through the joint hard work of all members and 
comrades and will end today. 
  The current session has examined and adopted the work report 
made by Vice Chairman Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub on behalf of the 
Standing Committee of the Tibet Regional CPPCC Committee. 
Members of the regional CPPCC committee have attended the 
second session of the sixth regional people's congress as 
observers, and heard the government work report by Chairman 
Gyaincain Norbu and other important reports. Through serious 
discussions, members of the regional CPPCC committee have 
further unified their thinking, raised their common 
understanding, heightened their spirit, and clearly understood 
various goals. In a highly responsible spirit, members have 
expressed many suitable opinions on reform, opening up, economic 
construction, and other important issues related to the vital 
interests of the broad masses of people. Their suggestions will 
certainly promote various tasks of this region in a positive 
manner. This year will be a crucial one for carrying out an 
all-around reform, achieving breakthroughs, and accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In his 
government work report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu has clearly 
explained the guiding principles for promoting the tasks of 
economic construction and deepening reform. We should see that 
the accomplishment of those tasks will have a very important 
bearing on fully implementing the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Fifth 
Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional 
CPC Committee, promoting economic development and social 
progress in this region and maintaining political stability. We 
should also see that the tasks facing us are very arduous and 
there are still many problems and difficulties on our road of 
advance. 
  Fellow members and comrades, the CPPCC is an important 
organization of our country in promoting multiparty cooperation 
and political consultation, and shoulders an important mission. 
The party's overall policy of seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability has fully embodied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
thinking for development and represents the fundamental 
interests of people of all nationalities in the whole country. 
The CPPCC organizations at various levels and all CPPCC members 
must seriously study and firmly implement Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC National Congress and the fifth Enlarged Plenary 
Meeting of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, 
emancipate their minds, further eliminate the old ideology and 
concept formed under the system of the planned economy, change 
their ways of thinking, use a new concept and new way compatible 
to a socialist market economy to guide our work, and constantly 
enhance our understanding in promoting reform, development, and 
stability. In discussing major affairs in the autonomous 
region, CPPCC members must take the entire national and regional 
situation into consideration and see the local and actual 
problems, and also take both long-term fundamental interests and 
the current measures into consideration. We should promote 
reform and development and at the same time maintain stability. 
We should strive to take part in the building of the two 
civilizations, and study and put forward suggestions and 
opinions for solving new contradictions and problems emerging in 
the course of reform. We should use the fruitful work of the 
CPPCC to unite various mass organizations and people of various 
nationalities on various fronts. We should give full play to all 
positive factors, turn negative factors into positive one, and 
unswervingly support the government's measures to deepen reform. 
  Fellow members, the realization of national progress and 
people's prosperity is the common wish of people of various 
nationalities in this region. We have already set major 
policies and understand our tasks. Now the key is to implement 
those policies and tasks. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line and under the 
leadership of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, we 
should closely unite around the party Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; seriously implement the 
guidelines of the current session; heighten our spirit; work 
with concerted efforts; struggle hard; and make greater 
contributions to creating a new situation for promoting reform, 
development, and stability in this region and to raising our 
work of taking part in and providing consultative service for 
government affairs to a new level! 
  I wish fellow members and all comrades good health and 
smooth 
progress in their work.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Liu Wei (0491 0251) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Tan Daobo (6223 6670 0590)] 
  [Text] Lhasa, 31 May (XINHUA) -- These reporters learned 
from a forum recently held by the Tibet Autonomous Region to 
mark the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the current 
conscription law that the region has sent nearly 10,000 fine 
youths to serve in the People Liberation Army [PLA] over the 
past 10 years. Last winter, Tibet sent a batch of new Tibetan 
soldiers inland for the first time. These soldiers share the 
important responsibility with fine young men and women of other 
nationalities of safeguarding the motherland. 
  Since the Conscription Law was promulgated, the Government 
of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region has successively formulated 
regulations such as the Detailed Rules for Carrying Out the 
Conscription Work and the Detailed Rules for Militia Affairs. 
It has launched extensive campaigns to publicize the 
Conscription Law across the entire region, thus significantly 
enhancing people's awareness of national defense. During the 
conscription period every year, masses of young people from 
urban and rural areas who are old enough to join the Army rush 
to enlist. The soldiers sent to the PLA by Tibet over the past 
10 years are all well-qualified, and none of them quit. Having 
joined the Army in different periods, excellent sons and 
daughters of Tibetan people right now are serving in various PLA 
units. Tibetan officers ranking from platoon leader to general 
can be found in the PLA. Moreover, in the past 10 years, 
governments at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region have 
made arrangements for more than 9,000 retired compulsory 
servicemen and for more than 460 soldiers who were transferred 
to civilian work. These demobilized and transferred veterans 
are playing an important role in promoting various undertakings 
of local economic construction and national development.

  [Text] At the national security work meeting held 
yesterday, Gao Siren, secretary of the Guangzhou City CPC 
Committee, urged party and government leaders of all units to 
genuinely discharge their duties to safeguard the city's social 
and political stability. In his speech, Gao Siren said: The 
current outstanding problem endangering the city's social and 
political stability is that the covert struggle is extremely 
acute, and the activities of subversion, infiltration, and 
division carried out by espionage agencies from outside the 
borders against our country have never ceased for a moment. The 
joining hands of the hostile forces at home and abroad has posed 
a threat to Guangzhou's stability. 
  He pointed out: It is necessary to further mobilize to set 
up a mass national security precaution structure, attach 
importance to carrying out education in covert struggle, enhance 
the alertness of the broad masses of people to the enemy's 
presence as well as their sense of secrecy and of national 
security so that everybody will foster the idea that it is 
everybody's duty to safeguard national security and so that they 
will dare and be good at using the law to struggle against all 
actions endangering national security. 
  Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu also spoke at the meeting. He 
pointed out: Some people have slackened their vigilance. They 
only see prospects for economic prosperity and development and 
are not alert to the enemy's presence and the sense of secrecy. 
They leak out economic, scientific and technological, and 
commercial secrets which should have been safeguarded. Some 
people are afraid of strengthening secrecy for fear of scaring 
foreign businessmen away. They are quite wrong. Leaders at all 
levels should frequently stress the issue of secrecy and should 
always keep it in mind.

  [Text] Guangdong authorities have banned visas for 
foreign journalists until after tomorrow's fifth anniversary of 
the Tiananmen massacre. 
  The propaganda section of the Guangdong party committee told 
organisers of a Guangzhou trade show which had invited foreign 
reporters to take part in its opening ceremony on June 4 that 
reporters would not be allowed to come until June 6. 
  "They say this is too sensitive a time," Chen Guanghui of 
the 
Guangdong environmental protection bureau, the organiser of 
Environment China '94, said. 
  Confirming the ban on foreign journalists, an official at 
the 
Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency (Xinhua) said the 
organisers should have checked with the Guangdong party 
committee before issuing invitations for the ceremony. 
  "They should have been more aware of the situation," the 
official said. 
  The Guangdong environmentalists appear to have been caught 
unaware by the sensitive anniversary. The opening ceremony -- 
scheduled for the morning of June 4 -- has suffered from 
withdrawals from at least two foreign government officials so 
far, Chen confirmed. 
  The Environment Minister of the Canadian province of 
Alberta, 
Brian Evans, and the Australian consul-general in Guangzhou, 
Maurine Chong, have both bailed out of the opening ceremony 
after previously agreeing to attend. 
  Spokesmen for the two officials said they had other matters 
to handle which came up unexpectedly. 
  Chen said that numerous senior officials from Beijing, 
including the director of the National Environmental Protection 
Bureau, Xie Zhenhua, have also cancelled plans to attend the 
exhibition's opening ceremony. 
  Beijing is known to have placed a ban on travel by senior 
officials during the period so they will be at their posts to 
deal with any outbreaks of protests. 
  Travellers worldwide have reported difficulties recently in 
getting individual travel visas, apparently part of China's 
attempts to avoid an influx of journalists and overseas-based 
dissidents into the country during the sensitive period.

<F P=106> [By Kuan Chieh (7070 2212): "CPC Vows to Come down to Hong </F>
Kong to Make Arrests"] 
  [Text] At a national work conference of public 
security, state security, armed police, and judicial department 
chiefs (bureaus) convened in Beijing in the first half of April, 
the CPC made known for the first time that public security and 
armed police officers have the power to track down and arrest 
key members and ringleaders of hostile organizations outside the 
borders who are involved in and mastermind violence and sabotage 
and who agitate to overthrow the socialist system and the 
central people's government on the mainland. 
  The headline sounds scary. 
  But it is genuinely true. 
<H5>  "Resolutely Strike at Hostile Elements Colluding with </H5>
Hostile Organizations Overseas" 
  The CPC convened from 7 to 9 April a national work 
conference of the heads of public security, state security, 
armed police, judicial departments (bureaus). High on its 
agenda was a resolute ban on outlawed hostile organizations and 
a stern crackdown on subversive activities and sabotage by 
hostile forces. Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, Xiao Yang, Ba Zhongxin, 
Tao Siju, and others attended and addressed the conference. Ren 
Jianxin spoke on behalf of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
and State Council: Banning and striking at organized activities 
to agitate and subvert the state and people's government and 
destroy social order by outlawed organizations and hostile 
forces are the main tasks in safeguarding state security, 
defending the constitution, and protecting social order. This 
is especially true for crack downs on domestic hostile forces 
and elements either colluding with overseas hostile political 
forces or those overseas who are working against China and the 
CPC or are in the employ of overseas hostile political forces 
and organizations, and this remains a key job for public 
security, the armed police, and judicial departments. 
  Ren Jianxin said: As soon as something goes wrong in society 
or there is a slight change in the climate of the outside world, 
domestic hostile forces and elements will emerge and pursue 
agitation, sabotage, and subversion with overseas hostile 
forces. This is regardless of what people might think about 
these matters, and these forces and elements will desist because 
of our warnings. Agitation, sabotage, and subversion are the 
missions of these hostile forces. Overthrowing the socialist 
system and the people's government and creating chaos in tandem 
with the hegemonic powers' China strategies are the objectives 
of these hostile forces, both outside the border and overseas. 
<H5>  "Public Security Has the Power To Track Down and Arrest Key </H5>
Members of Hostile Organizations Outside the Border" 
  Regarding "counterrevolution," the conference chose to 
stress 
and pay more attention to its substance rather than its name. 
The conference came to a consensus on jail term reductions, 
parole, and medical parole for good behavior for criminals on 
counterrevolutionary charges. The conference made known, for 
the first time, that under specifically defined circumstances, 
public security and armed police officers have the power to 
track down and arrest key members and ringleaders of hostile 
organizations outside the borders whose involvement in 
masterminding violence, sabotage, and agitation in the mainland 
to overthrow the socialist system and the central people's 
government has been proven. 
<H5>  The Wolf Is Really Coming </H5>
  "Outside the borders" in CPC parlance refers to Hong Kong 
and 
Macao. If we read between the lines of the above statements and 
check them against the report on "a hundred Hong Kong people 
blacklisted" in the December 1993 edition of our journal and the 
"Success 240" military exercise reported in the article on the 
"Guangzhou Military Region's mock takeover of Hong Kong" in the 
February 1994 edition, which reveals that CPC public security 
officers have been stationed in Hong Kong since as early as 
1992, and link them with the early secret visits to Hong Kong by 
a massive number of CPC officials, they will get a good idea of 
how well prepared the CPC is for the move. Lu Ping's statements 
on his recent visit about Hong Kong being an economic city and 
not a political city also foreshadows such a move! 
  Even before the death knell of 1997, the good-natured Hong 
Kong people will witness the horrific drama of CPC people coming 
down to Hong Kong to make arrests with force. 
  There was once a person who cried that the "wolf was 
coming," 
which turned out to be a false alarm. But this time, the wolf 
is really coming.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Hai-tao (3076 3189 3447): "CPC Authorities </F>
Secretly Draft Journalism Regulations for Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] After the Xi Yang incident, mass media people in 
Hong Kong feel that the CPC authorities have adopted a tough 
approach to the Hong Kong media without any willingness to 
compromise. Retaliation was immediate against those Hong Kong 
reporters who signed a statement boycotting official propaganda 
events in China, and they were not to be allowed to cover news 
related to the Qiandao Hu incident. The rapid retaliation by 
the CPC authorities shocked many people. 
  An informed source in the CPC propaganda department said 
that 
the tough approach taken by the CPC authorities to the Hong Kong 
media was related to the "leftist" shift of their general policy 
toward Hong Kong. Lu Ping's recent remarks negating Hong Kong's 
role as a political city show that the CPC authorities have in 
fact revised the "one country, two systems" policy laid down by 
Deng Xiaoping to deal with the Hong Kong issue. At present, the 
CPC's interpretation of the "one country, two systems" policy 
is: the "one country, two systems" formula refers only to the 
economic system; that is, Hong Kong may continue horse racing, 
night club dancing, and stock speculation. However, Hong Kong 
people must not be allowed to oppose the Communist Party in the 
political realm and must abide by the four cardinal principles. 
That is, in the political realm, there will be no "one country, 
two systems." Such an interpretation is substantially different 
from their previous position of allowing people to swear at the 
Communist Party. 
  According to the source, the CPC authorities recently 
decided 
to bring mass media operations in Hong Kong under strict control 
after 1997 in order to guarantee social stability and guarantee 
China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. They will not 
allow some people to "create disturbances" in Hong Kong by using 
press freedom. 
  An informed source revealed that a relevant department of 
the 
CPC authorities had set up a special body to secretly formulate 
rules of behavior and management regulations for the press in 
Hong Kong after 1997. This will substantially narrow the scope 
of press freedom in Hong Kong from what it is now. 
  He said: Another measure the CPC authorities will take is to 
run a party organ fully representative of Beijing's position. 
The newspaper will be directly run by the government of the 
special administrative region [SAR] and could be named XIANGGANG 
TEQU BAO [HONG KONG SPECIAL REGION JOURNAL]. He said the plan 
had been put into practice, and a number of officials would be 
transferred from various journalist units to Hong Kong batch by 
batch to prepare to publish the newspaper. Reportedly, a deputy 
editor-in-chief of BEIJING RIBAO has recently been appointed as 
deputy editor-in-chief of TA KUNG PAO, and he will also be on 
the preparatory group of XIANGGANG TEQU BAO. 
  The informed source also said that in his view and that of 
his friends, if major change does not take place in the Chinese 
Government, after 1997, the press freedom enjoyed by Hong Kong 
people today will be substantially restricted by the Beijing 
authorities. As things are different than the mainland, the CPC 
authorities will not control the nonpolitical parts of the 
press. However, political news reportage will be brought under 
strict control according to news rules and regulations. He said 
that it was still unclear how the new rules and regulations 
would be formulated, because the Beijing authorities kept things 
highly secret in this regard. It is expected that the CPC 
authorities will lay down restrictions on subjects and opinions 
to be handled by the press in the name of safeguarding state 
security and interests, maintaining social stability, and 
preventing subversive activities against the government. The 
SAR government will be authorized to close down mass media which 
violate the regulations, or legal action may be taken against 
them. 
  However, he thought that the CPC authorities would not 
release regulations for controlling the press too soon. They 
would not do this until the date of government transfer in 1997 
is very close, because such an act is obviously a violation of 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Press 
freedom is the last line of defense for Hong Kong people to 
safeguard their current lifestyle. The British have never 
published any official organs in Hong Kong. The overall plan 
Beijing will use to control the press and public opinion in Hong 
Kong will certainly destroy Hong Kong people's confidence and 
could even throw the local community into complete chaos.

  [Text] Accompanied by Wang Xianmin, member of the standing 
committee of the provincial party committee and secretary 
general, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, visited the Harbin city party committee and the city 
government today and exchanged views with comrades of relevant 
departments on how to build Harbin into an international 
economic and trade city as quickly as possible. Tian Fengshan, 
acting governor, and Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, were also present at the meeting. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Harbin is our country's [words indistinct] 
city with a brilliant history. In the present reform and 
opening up, it is still very highly renown. Harbin has 
conditions for building itself into an international economic 
and trade city. However, it should also relatively make 
readjustments. First of all, it should emancipate the thinking 
and change the irrational industrial structure; second, it 
should be determined to readjust the production set-up and exert 
strenuous efforts to develop tertiary industry. 
  Yue Qifeng stressed: Changing the city functions needs the 
enthusiasm from various sectors. In addition to boosting the 
enthusiasm of large and medium-sized enterprises, it is also 
necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm of small 
enterprises and let them enter the market. In this aspect, we 
should expand the functions of all districts and enable them to 
realistically become first-level organizations in an effort to 
promote the economic development of districts and neighborhoods. 
  He said: The greater the hinterland a city has the more 
advantages it will have for its future development. So, Harbin 
must have good plans for developing what it intends to develop 
and so do its neighboring areas. 
  Yue Qifeng pointed out: The future development lies in 
trained personnel and trained personnel lies in education. 
Harbin is a scientific, technological, educational, and 
cultural center, which should give play to the advantages of 
trained personnel and decontrol scientific research units and 
trained personnel. It must not be afraid of letting the 
knowledgeable people become prosperous ahead of others. It is 
necessary to formulate policies and actively develop 
nongovernmental scientific research organs in an effort to form 
new economic growing points. 
  Yue Qifeng stressed at the end of this speech: Harbin has 
quite a number of large and medium-sized enterprises. The local 
government should support and serve large and medium-sized 
enterprises, and use their advantages to bring along the 
development of regional economy.

  [Text] Following the opinions of the State Planning 
Commission as well as the State Economic and Trade Commission on 
reforming the circulation system of crude oil and refined oil, 
which were approved by the State Council recently, Liaoning 
began implementing an important adjustment on the circulation 
system of crude oil and refined oil on 1 May. Resources would 
be distributed, and prices fixed by the state in a unified 
manner. 
  In the past few years, the issue of Liaoning's irrational 
management system as well as unreasonable prices of oil products 
has become more conspicuous with each day. Dispersed resources 
of oil products, overlapping in management, failure in price 
control, and chaos in the market have become more and more 
serious, thus providing the soil for speculators, profiteers, 
and law and discipline violators to take the opportunity to reap 
staggering profits and engage in corrupt practice. Therefore, 
it is necessary to take effective measures to reform the current 
circulation system of crude oil and refined oil, to strengthen 
the macro-management of the production and circulation of crude 
oil and refined oil, to rationalize the prices of oil products, 
to rectify the order of circulation, to reduce circulation 
links, and to establish, step by step, a standardized, vigorous, 
and orderly circulation system of crude oil and refined oil 
which meets the demands of a socialist market economy. 
  The major content of this reform is to achieve reasonable 
distribution of resources, letting the refineries belonging to 
the Petrochemical General Company process land crude oil and 
imported crude oil in a unified manner. For the marketing of 
refined oil, distribution will be made under state guidance to 
change the duplicate and decentralized management. The prices 
will be fixed by the state. The state's control of the producer 
prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices of crude oil and 
refined oil not only ensures the profits of the producers and 
consumers but also keeps the prices stable. Categorization of 
taxes and rate of taxation will be unified. Unified tax 
categories and tax rates will be applied to all the coastal 
areas, inland areas, special zones, and development zones as 
well as state-owned, collective, "three types of 
foreign-funded," and individual enterprises which deal in crude 
oil and refined oil. Governments at all levels should not give 
them preferential treatment by reducing or exempting their taxes 
or fix their tax quotas. Sale channels should be made 
reasonable, and intermediate links should be reduced. 
Provincial, city, and county petroleum companies should be the 
main channels of selling refined oil, and the resources of 
refined oil should be distributed by the petroleum companies at 
all levels in a unified manner according to plans. All 
refineries should sell petroleum only to petroleum companies. 
Current refined oil wholesale organizations should be screened 
and reorganized, and retail gas stations (spots) should be 
rectified. Party, government, and army organs at all levels are 
not permitted to engage themselves in the wholesale and retail 
sale of crude oil and refined oil. The wholesale organizations 
which have been reorganized will be brought into the main sales 
channels. Gas stations, which prove qualified to engage in the 
business after joint investigation and rectification, should 
phase in the system of sales on a commission basis. They should 
replenish their stock from the local petroleum companies and 
sell according to the retail price set. Those who do not sell 
at the set price, pass the bad off as the good, give short 
measure, and evade taxes will have their oil supplies stopped 
and their status as sales agents canceled.

Takes Place in Hefei Prison"] 
  [Text] At 2100 on 1 May, more than 200 convicts in two 
blocks of Hefei Prison collectively refused to sleep in protest 
against the prison authorities. According to prison rules, 
Sundays and national holidays should be nonworking days. This 
year, International Labor Day, that is, 1 May, happened to be on 
a Sunday. The following Monday should thus have been a 
compensation day for the convicts. However, the prison 
authorities announced that routine work would continue on 2 May. 
The decision aroused protests from the convicts, who all 
refused to sleep. The prisoners sang the song "Unity Is 
Strength" and shouted slogans, such as "guaranteeing off days, 
opposing forced work" and "we want to meet leaders, oppose 
suppression." At 2300 that evening, the convicts opened the 
doors of their blocks and staged a sit-in in the prison yard. 
Guards fired warning shots and drove the convicts back into 
their cells. Then, the two sides fought [as published]. It is 
said that there were more than 30 casualties. One prison guard 
was killed by rioting convicts with iron bars and three 
prisoners were shot dead. After the incident, the prison 
authorities were forced to cancel "normal work" on 2 May.

<F P=106> ["Speech by Gyaincain Norbu at an autonomous regional </F>
meeting of provincial- and prefectural-level cadres on 22 May 
1994"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  The Second Sessions of the Sixth Autonomous Regional 
People's 
Congress and the Sixth Autonomous Regional Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] are 
being held at a crucial moment when the autonomous region is 
accelerating its reform and opening up. Over the last week and 
more, the two sessions have concentrated on discussing the main 
topics of reform, development, and stability as well as the 
general task of "seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability." 
They have fully displayed the superiority of the people's 
congress system and the political consultation system in 
actively discussing the important issues of Tibet. Entrusted by 
the people of all nationalities and all walks of life in Tibet, 
the people's congress deputies and the CPPCC committee members, 
with a high degree of sense of responsibility, have 
realistically appraised last year's government work, seriously 
examined and discussed this year's government work plans, put 
forward many valuable comments and suggestions, and placed 
ardent expectations on governments at all levels. We must 
treasure very much the encouragement given to all government 
functionaries by the people's congress deputies and the CPPCC 
committee members. We must treat the people's demands and 
aspirations in a very responsible way and live up to their 
expectations. We must take the current opportunity to enhance 
vigor, work diligently and conscientiously, and do even better 
government work to make the 2.3 million people of all 
nationalities in Tibet rest assured and satisfied. 
  In the work of stabilizing the situation and the 
antisplittist struggle, our situation is more special, our 
struggle is more complex, and our tasks are more arduous than 
other parts of the country. The work of stabilizing the 
situation is an important task shared by the party committees, 
the public security and judicial departments, and governments at 
all levels. Although our reform and development tasks are 
particularly arduous this year, we must not attend to one thing 
only and lose sight of another. We must attach equal importance 
to both the work of maintaining stability and the work of 
promoting reform and development, attend to both constantly and 
unremittingly, and ensure social stability. Next, I will 
discuss several points of view regarding the economic work. 
<H5>  1. The present economic situation </H5>
  Since the beginning of this year, governments at various 
levels, seriously adhering to the guidelines of the Fifth 
Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional 
CPC Committee and the regional economic work conference, have 
achieved initial success in deepening reforms, opening the 
region wider to the outside, and developing the economy. While 
striving for the overall progress of reform, the governments 
have taken the crucial step to formulate comprehensive reform 
plans. All productive and business activities are proceeding 
smoothly, and the economic operation as a whole is basically 
normal. 
  Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Rural Economy -- In this 
year, various localities are continuing to strengthen leadership 
over the work in rural and pastoral areas, formulating and 
implementing productive measures, continuing to readjust the 
production structure, and increasing the ratio of cash crops and 
fodder crops in grain-producing areas. The autonomous region is 
growing 3.23 million mu of crops, up 2 percent from last year. 
Of the crops, grain occupies an area of 2.82 million mu, the 
same as last year; rape accounts for 240,000 mu, up 33 percent 
from last year; and fodder crops cover 170,000 mu, up 70 
percent. Since last summer, some localities have suffered 
droughts due to less rainfall, and other localities have 
experienced storms and snow storms. However, the loss in animal 
husbandry was less than anticipated thanks to efforts to combat 
natural disasters and protect livestock. Of 2.38 million 
newborn animals in the region this year, 1,794,000 had survived 
as of the end of March; and the survival rate was 76.1 percent, 
slightly lower than last year's corresponding period. In the 
same period, 850,000 full-grown animals died; and the death rate 
was 3.7 percent, slightly higher than last year's corresponding 
period. 
  Industrial Production and Transport Service -- The region's 
total industrial output value in the first four months was 113 
million yuan, up 2.4 percent from the same period of last year. 
The outputs of all major products increased during the period 
as compared with last year's corresponding period, except those 
of timber and cement which decreased somewhat. Electric power 
generation increased by 7.7 percent; chromium ores, 82.5 
percent; boromagnesite, 65.2 percent; leather, 108.8 percent; 
wool, 25.9 percent; and flour, 28.3 percent. State-owned 
transport service handled 152,900 tonnes of cargo, up 14.8 
percent from last year's corresponding period. Of the cargo 
transported, inbound goods increased by 22.6 percent, outbound 
goods rose 10.6 percent, and [unintelligible word -- possibly 
Tibetan Language] [fen yun 0433 6663] increased by 10.9 percent. 
  Capital Construction -- Projects under construction and 
continued from the previous year proceeded fairly smoothly. A 
total of 230 million yuan was invested in capital construction 
in the period from January through April, accounting for 11.42 
percent of this year's investment target and slightly higher 
than the figure in the same period last year. There were 16 
above-norm projects continued from the previous year and 10 
above-norm projects being newly launched. 
  Foreign Trade and Tourism -- During the period from January 
to April, the value of contracts for imports across the border 
reached about $333,900 and the export turnover amounted to $1.36 
million; both grew 100 percent over the same period last year. 
The value of contracts for imports via shipping service 
amounted to about $20.69 million, $20.09 million more than the 
same period last year; exports were valued at $31,400, up 100 
percent from the same period last year. Travel agencies 
received 1,972 foreign tourists, with a business income of 
19,573,300 yuan and $374,600 in foreign exchange earnings. 
  The Situation of Revenue -- Tibet collected a total of 
52.877 
million yuan in taxes from January through April; this includes 
29.233 million yuan in industrial and business taxes, up 16.7 
percent from the same period last year. 
  Banking Conditions -- By the end of April, Tibet had issued 
a 
total of 3.553 billion yuan in various kinds of loans, and 
savings totalled 3.837 billion yuan, 831 million yuan and 764 
million yuan more than the figures in the same period last year, 
respectively. Savings deposits in urban and rural areas reached 
986 million yuan by the end of April, 29.2 million yuan more 
than the same period last year. The issuance of state bonds has 
been completely successfully. 
  There are still some problems that must not be left 
unattended in the current economic work: 1. some pastoral areas 
hit by storms and blizzards are having a hard time fighting 
disasters and keeping their livestock; 2. due to price hikes and 
other reasons, enterprises' production cost has risen and 
operation are difficult; 3. the financial and taxation situation 
is not promising; prefectures, cities, and units are crying 
loudly for a supplementary budget; collection of some categories 
of taxes is not satisfactory, even declining; 4. affected by the 
price readjustment in the hinterland, prices for the basic 
necessities of life and means of production in Tibet are rising 
rapidly; many residents and people living in agricultural and 
pastoral areas have strong resentment because their lives are 
conspicuously harsh. 
<H5>  2. Conscientiously Organize and Implement Reform Programs </H5>
  Since the beginning of this year, we have made the 
establishment of a new socialist market economic structure our 
goal and, in light of the state's reform arrangements, 
concentrated our efforts to work out a series of reform programs 
which have taken Tibet's situation into consideration. In the 
second half of this year, we will successively issue reform 
programs for the oil industry, foreign trade, and others as well 
as policies aiming at properly solving the wage problem in some 
enterprises. The reform for this year requires greater effort, 
involves a wider scope, sets higher demands, poses more 
difficulties, and creates more hard work. Judging from the 
current situation, our principal problems are that the reform 
has not been carried out satisfactorily and has proceeded 
slowly. To make sure all reform programs will be carried out 
smoothly, we must pay attention to the following aspects at 
present: 
  First, we must enhance our steadfastness in reform. Tibet's 
rapid economic development in recent years should, in the final 
analysis, attribute to reform and opening up. The practice has 
proven that without reform and opening up, there will be no way 
for Tibet to develop its economy. Reform will certainly involve 
readjustment in the structure of interests and even affect the 
temporary interests of some areas and people in a certain 
period; thus a variety of serious difficulties arise. There are 
many problems, particularly those concerning the economic field, 
that must be resolved through deepening reform and accelerating 
development. We cannot waver in our resolve in reform and 
consider resuming the old path of a planned economy whenever we 
meet difficulties. Reform is like a boat sailing against the 
current; it must forge ahead, or it will be driven back. We 
should be aware that people of all nationalities in Tibet, 
particularly leaders at various levels, are on the same boat of 
reform; only by helping each other, unifying their minds, and 
braving the wind and the waves can they successfully reach the 
opposite bank. In the midst of torrents and rapids, all the 
pessimism, disappointment, complaints, and censures will be of 
no avail. Therefore, on the issue of reform, we must strengthen 
our belief, take the overall situation into consideration, and 
set our eyes on the future; leaders at and above county level, 
particularly, must unify their thinking and paces; press forward 
and be brave in taking risks in the face of difficulties; 
actively guide and organize the people to come up with methods, 
countermeasures, and answers with the new ideas of the 
development of a socialist market economy; and fulfill their 
responsibilities as leaders. Only by doing so can we truly put 
the overall situation of reform under control. 
  Second, we should fully understand the contents of the 
reform. The reform plans to be implemented this year consist of 
a wide range of things and new concepts; therefore, study of 
these reform plans is arduous work, especially at a time when we 
are still quite unfamiliar with the basic theory of the 
socialist market economy. Currently, the pressing task is for 
leading cadres at all levels to gain a good understanding as 
soon as possible of the basic contents of all reform plans, the 
applicability of the established policies, and specific skills 
for implementing these policies; to ensure training of 
specialized personnel; to ensure that the established policies 
are not interpreted one-sidedly; and to see that implementation 
of these policies is not delayed and the reform plans are 
carried out faithfully. 
  Third, we should ensure a good job in conducting propaganda 
and in explaining the reform plans to the masses. Reform is an 
undertaking for all the people. We can achieve nothing if we 
solely rely on the efforts of leaders and specialized personnel 
and if we lack the masses' understanding, support, and 
participation. Therefore, we should focus propaganda work on the 
grassroots. We should publish popular and easy-to-understand 
propaganda materials to meet the needs of peoples at various 
educational levels; we should hold radio and television 
lectures, publish special columns in newspapers and magazines, 
and organize lectures by specialized personnel to conduct 
elaborate propaganda to enable the masses to understand the 
basic contents of reforms. In addition, we should clearly 
define the established policies, defuse the masses' misgivings 
and misunderstanding, and encourage them to actively and 
self-consciously devote themselves to carrying out reform. 
  Fourth, we should quicken the pace of implementing the 
reform 
plans. In laying down the general demand of the whole party's 
work, central leaders begin with "Seize the Opportunity To 
Deepen Reform." Therefore, we must not miss the current good 
opportunity for reform. Judging from the developments in the 
last few months, the slower reform is carried out, the more 
problems are accumulated and the more difficult it becomes to 
solve them. Therefore, we must quicken the pace of our work. 
On the one hand, general affairs departments and departments in 
charge should concentrate their efforts on formulating feasible 
relevant measures to support reform and implement these measures 
as soon as possible. On the other hand, as clearly stated in 
the policy of reform, we should address ourselves to 
implementing those measures that are more complete. Problems 
common to reforms in various fields may be referred to the next 
higher authorities. But, no one is allowed to change 
established measures and invent their own. 
<H5>  3. Ensure a Good Job in Current Production Work and </H5>
Properly Arrange the Masses' Daily Life 
  This year's economic work was set forth in detail at the 
economic work conference early this year and at the current 
people's congress meeting, and it is being carried out in all 
localities. Here I would like to stress work in five of the 
many fields. 
  The first is agricultural and animal husbandry production. 
While strengthening field management, doing work to prevent 
natural disasters, and restoring production work in 
disaster-stricken areas, we should build capital water projects 
in a timely manner for farmlands and grasslands. The second is 
that, industrial and transportation enterprises should increase 
their vitality through deepening reform, should strive to 
improve their profitablity, and should improve their efficiency 
by improving management. The third is to properly carry out 
construction of key projects. We should ensure that 
construction is carried out as scheduled, ensure construction 
quality, and ensure that the annual construction plans are 
fulfilled. The fourth is to do a good financial and taxation 
job. This year's financial budget has been examined by the 
people's congress. We should do our work strictly according to 
the budget to uphold the budget's solemnness. In principle, no 
extra budgets will be granted, barring special situations. 
Regarding taxation work, localities experiencing shrinking tax 
revenues should seriously look into the causes and take measures 
to ensure that their tax revenue plans are fulfilled. [no fifth 
point as published] 
  Here, I would like particularly to mention the problem in 
people's livelihood. Generally speaking, we have achieved 
positive results in improving the living standards of the people 
in the agricultural and pastoral areas of our region. But we 
should not be too optimistic about the work of helping people 
get rid of poverty and become rich. We should not overestimate 
the income standard of peasants and herdsmen. It should be 
noted that there are many people who have not yet solved the 
problem of having enough food to eat and clothing to wear. With 
the introduction of the state's reform policy and price 
readjustment in the hinterland, our region is experiencing an 
excessive growth in commodity prices. On top of that, some 
areas in our region witnessed natural disasters last year. At 
present, people in our region have many problems in their 
livelihood. In accordance with the investigations conducted by 
the regional government in various localities and opinions 
expressed at the sessions of the regional people's congress and 
the regional committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, all localities are experiencing grain 
shortages to some extent. Some households have even run out of 
grain. Some workers and staff members of enterprises are also 
experiencing hardship in their daily life. These are problems 
deserving our great attention. Areas with grain shortages should 
take care to transport grain and ensure the supply of the 
people's food. Meanwhile, all localities should work hard to 
raise funds for helping the poor and relieving disasters. They 
should ensure provision of aid to the people in a timely 
fashion. Efforts should be made to organize people in Ali [7093 
6849] and other areas severely affected by the natural disasters 
to provide for and help themselves by engaging in production. 
At the same time, we should pay attention to the prevention and 
cure of epidemic diseases. People are strongly complaining 
about unwarranted price hikes and arbitrary exaction of fees. 
Price control is an urgent and heavy responsibility for the 
government. Some other problems are likely to occur if we fail 
to adopt effective measures. To effectively control the 
excessive growth of commodity prices and stabilize the people's 
livelihood, it is necessary to strengthen macroeconomic control; 
conscientiously improve price and market control by 
comprehensively using legal, economic, and administrative means; 
carry out the practice of showing the price for each commodity; 
resolutely stop the illegal practice of driving up prices; and 
strengthen the supervision of prices of people's daily 
necessities. In the near future, the Planning Commission will 
carry out measures for supervising the prices of 19 basic 
necessities including grain, edible oil, and tea as well as 
prices in the service industry. This is an effort to control 
prices within a limit that most of the people can bear. To 
check the excessive growth of prices and combat unfair trade 
practices, it is advisable to formulate regulations for 
combating price cheating and exorbitant profits. Such 
regulations can be formulated by the Price Bureau with the help 
of departments in charge of industrial and commercial affairs 
and taxation. It is necessary to carry out this year's price 
inspection in a thoroughgoing manner. Active efforts should be 
made to raise funds and establish a reserve system for important 
materials such as grain, tea, and salt so as to strengthen our 
ability to control commodity prices. Further efforts should be 
made to control the charging of various fees. Last year, 87 
kinds of fees were abolished after consolidation. As a result, 
the phenomena of arbitrary exaction of fees was under control. 
But such phenomena cropped up again in recent months, 
particularly in Lhasa city. Therefore, it is necessary to 
continue to consolidate administrative fees and business 
charges. Resolute efforts should be made to ban any fees that 
are unreasonable, without proper authorization, or not within 
the proper scope. With the help of the Economic Planning 
Commission, the Finance Department should work harder to carry 
out this work. 
<H5>  4. Pay Close Attention To Making Proper Preparations for </H5>
the Construction Projects To Be Carried Out as a Tribute to the 
Grand Celebration [of Tibet's 30th Founding Anniversary] 
  The central authorities are very concerned about Tibet's 
economic development and social progress. Earlier, the central 
authorities sent special working teams to Tibet to survey and 
study projects in a bid to help it map out a long-term 
development program. After conducting on-site surveys, they 
basically reached a consensus with the autonomous region. 
Preparations are in full swing now; the projects reported to 
the higher authorities are under consideration; and arrangements 
for these projects are being made. These projects requested by 
Tibet center on agriculture, animal husbandry, infrastructure, 
and social development. They proceed from the interests of the 
whole region and take into consideration the need for the 
construction and development in the future. A portion of the 
preliminary work has been completed already. As regards those 
projects whose conditions are ripe for the commencement of 
construction, we must pay close attention to ensuring that funds 
are channelled to their proper recipients so that construction 
may commence at an early date. As regards those projects that 
need to be reported to the higher authorities for approval later 
on, we must make whatever readjustments are necessary and give 
as much priority to important projects as possible on the basis 
of the suggestions made by the working teams. If preliminary 
work is found to be inadequate, we must make the best use of 
time available to make careful calculations, to prepare an 
accurate list of materials in detail, and to report them 
promptly to higher authorities. As there is only a little more 
than a year left before the time for our grand celebration 
arrives, we face heavy tasks and are pressed for time. All 
prefectures, cities, and departments certainly must organize 
competent teams to make proper preparations for commencement of 
construction. They must make concerted efforts and closely 
coordinate with each other under the unified command of Tibet's 
leading group for projects so that construction may commence 
immediately after projects are approved and a guaranteed number 
of projects may be completed with guranteed construction quality. 
  Those construction projects which have been included in the 
autonomous region's plan and are scheduled for completion around 
the time of next year's grand celebration must be treated as the 
61 projects which are to be carried out as a tribute to the 
grand celebration. They must be placed under unified 
management. All quarters must guarantee that their construction 
jobs are completed on schedule to pay tribute to Tibet's 30th 
founding anniversary. 
<H5>  5. Change Work Style and Pay Close Attention to </H5>
Implementation 
  Generally speaking, the work style of organs and leadership 
in Tibet is good. However, lax enforcement of discipline, 
dilatory work style, low efficiency in handling official 
business, shifting responsibility to others, and arguing back 
and forth do exist in some departments and units. Some leading 
cadres confuse themselves with ordinary citizens. Instead of 
positively devising ways to solve problems that have cropped up 
in carrying out work, they blame others, grumble, and complain 
as if they were bystanders. Some individual departments and 
leaders even show out-and-out disregard for orders and bans. 
They adopt an attitude of overtly complying with but covertly 
opposing the decisions made by party committees and governments. 
As a result, some important decisions cannot be implememted 
even after stalling for a long time, thus producing undesirable 
influences. 
  This year's tasks on reform, development, and stability are 
very heavy. Under such circumstances, leaders at all levels and 
all government functionaries must show a strong sense of 
devotion and responsibility, and redouble their efforts in a 
spirit of seizing every moment. Our power is given by the 
people. Our government is called a people's government mainly 
because it serves the people in a down-to-earth manner. This is 
a fundamental difference from a nonpeople's government. Hence, 
we must further change our work style and mental attitude, 
mingle with the masses, plunge into the thick of reform, and go 
to the frontline of production to study new circumstances, solve 
new problems, spread new experiences, and raise various areas of 
work to a new level. The authorities of Qamdo, Xigaze, and 
Shannan recently sent work groups of various sizes to farming 
and pastoral areas to conduct investigations and studies and to 
provide work guidance. It is hoped that all autonomous regional 
departments and all prefectures and cities will take active 
measures to send competent work groups to the grass roots to 
implement the guidelines of the "two sessions." 
  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate family 
planning work. It is our country's long-term basic policy to 
practice family planning, control population growth, and improve 
the quality of its population. The "Decision on Strengthening 
Family Planning Work and Strictly Controlling Population Growth" 
promulgated by the party Central Committee and the State Council 
noted explicitly: "Family planning should be practiced among 
minority nationalities to raise the economic and cultural levels 
of minority areas and to improve national quality." The State 
Family Planning Commission and the State Nationalities Affairs 
Commission last year specifically convened a national conference 
on family planning among minority nationalities, and formulated 
relevant policies and measures. Our region still experiences 
rather rapid population growth. According to the fourth 
national census, the national birth rate stood at 21.06 per 
thousand, whereas the birth rate of our region was a high 27.6 
per thousand. The region's population growth over the past 10 
years has averaged 38,000 people each year, resulting in a total 
population of 2.318 million people at the end of 1993. Failure 
to exercise due control will not only make it difficult to 
improve the overall quality of the population and to effectively 
improve living standards, but will also only sharpen the 
contradiction between population and economic development, 
resource utilization, and environmental protection. Therefore, 
an urgent task confronting us is to carry out family planning 
work and allow the population to grow in a planned way. We must 
now focus on three tasks. 1) we should improve our 
understanding and unify our thinking. The regional party 
committee and government take family planning work seriously. 
They have incorporated birth control into the overall plan for 
regional economic and social development, and laid down the 
guiding thought for family planning, which states clearly: We 
should regard family planning as a fundamental plan for 
developing the economy and improving national quality. Keeping 
in mind the need to facilitate economic construction, the fight 
against poverty to promote prosperity, the improvement of living 
standards, and gradual national economic growth, we should 
devote great efforts to improving the quality of the population 
so that Tibet's population will grow in coordination with the 
development of various economic and social services. Leaders at 
all levels should seriously study documents and regulations 
regarding family planning, gain a profound understanding of the 
guidelines of those documents and regulations, enhance their 
understanding, and improve family planning work along with 
economic construction. 2) We should stabilize the family 
planning policies currently in force. The family planning 
policies which our region currently implement were formulated 
according to popular wishes and the practical experiences of 
many years. We should seriously study, master, and correctly 
implement those policies. In farming and pastoral areas, we 
should firmly follow the principle of "stressing five main 
aspects," without loosening or tightening it at will. Moreover, 
we should gain a timely understanding and grasp of new 
circumstances and sum them up, with the aim of improving our 
region's family planning policies. 3) We should strive to 
provide good services. Aside from vigorously publicizing 
policies and information about family planning and maternity and 
child care, family planning, medical, and health care 
departments should improve the training of relevant personnel, 
raise technological levels, provide all kinds of good services, 
and fulfill people's needs. 
  Comrades: This year is crucial to our region's efforts to 
speed up the pace of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, 
and quicken the pace of development. The new situation has set 
even stricter demands for various tasks. We must live up to the 
high expectations of the party and people, implement the 
guidelines of the "two sessions" in a motivational spirit with a 
rigorous approach and through solid work, and usher in the 30th 
anniversary of the autonomous region's founding with remarkable 
achievements.

<F P=106> [Speech by Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the Tibet </F>
Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, at a regional meeting on 22 
May; place not given: "Tibet's Current Antisplittist Struggle 
Situation and Task To Stabilize the Situation"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  Today, the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and 
Government are holding a special meeting of leading cadres with 
party membership at the provincial and prefectural levels. I 
would like to take this opportunity to brief you on some current 
developments in Tibet's antisplittist struggle, to analyze the 
current antisplittist struggle situation, and to lay down a plan 
for our next-step work. My purpose is to enable party and 
government organizations and leading cadres at all levels to 
gain an in-depth understanding of the antisplittist struggle 
situation currently facing Tibet, to further unify their 
thinking, to increase their initiative and enhance their 
self-consciousness in carrying out the antisplittist struggle, 
and to strengthen their confidence that we will win the 
struggle, in order to further stabilize Tibet's situation and to 
ensure that our reform, opening up, and economic construction 
are carried out smoothly. Comrade Zicheng just briefed you on 
the new developments in Tibet's current antisplittist struggle. 
According to the guidelines of a study conducted by the 
regional CPC committee, I would like to offer a few opinions on 
Tibet's current antisplittist struggle situation and our task of 
stabilizing the situation. 
<H5>  1. An Analysis of Tibet's Current Antisplittist Struggle </H5>
Situation 
  This year is a critical one for the country to take an 
important step toward building a socialist market economic 
system, to achieve breakthrough progress in attaining reform, 
and to further speed up economic development. This year also is 
one for Tibet to raise its reform, opening up, and economic 
development to a new level. The central authorities have 
decided to hold this year the third meeting on work related to 
Tibet to study important principles and policies on Tibet's 
economic and social development and stability in the new 
situation. The meeting will have extremely great significance 
for maintaining Tibet's long-term stability. Next year marks 
the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet 
Autonomous Region; starting in the second half of this year, the 
party Central Committee and the State Council will assist Tibet 
in building a number of key projects to accelerate Tibet's 
economic development. All in all, a new climax will emerge this 
year in Tibet's economic construction and socialist development 
-- Tibet's development prospects are encouraging. 
  As for Tibet's antisplittist struggle situation, over the 
years, the CPC Committee, the government, military, police, and 
people of Tibet, under the correct leadership of and the timely 
guidance provided by the party Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the Central Military Commission, have done a great 
deal of antisplittist work and have won important victories. 
Currently, Tibet's antisplittist struggle situation is good in 
general -- the whole region is enjoying political stability, 
social stability, and nationalities unity; people feel assured, 
and our border defenses are strong, thus providing a good social 
climate for smoothly carrying out the region's reform, opening 
up, and economic construction and for continuing to improve the 
people's living standards. Nevertheless, the hostile 
international forces and splittists both inside and outside the 
country, due to their class nature, will never take their defeat 
lying down. They have done everything they can to step up their 
splittist and sabotage activities; therefore, the antisplittist 
struggle situation facing us is severe, and the task is quite 
arduous. The main reasons for this are: 
  The hostile international forces have adopted a hostile 
attitude toward the socialist system and consider China's 
unification and power to be threats to themselves. Splittists 
outside the country have stepped up their collusion with Western 
hostile forces, have distorted the facts, have spread rumors to 
mislead people, and have attacked China's domestic and foreign 
policy, vainly attempting to exert international pressure on us. 
  Splittist elements at home have colluded with the splittist 
forces outside the country and have stepped up their splittist 
activities in cities, agricultural and pastoral areas, and 
temples in some localities in Tibet. Some localities have 
opposed slogans and handbills, the numbers of witches and 
sorcerers have increased in some localities, and rumors of 
various sorts have been spread widely, causing anxiety for 
people in some grass-roots areas. 
  Due to infiltrations and instigations by splittist elements 
outside the country, a small number of our cadres and workers 
have wavered in their political stand. Party and government 
organizations and leading cadres at all levels should be 
prepared for danger in times of peace and should have a sober 
understanding of the problems and the intense and complicated 
antisplittist struggle we are facing. We should have a clear 
understanding of the situation and our tasks, do our work well, 
and stand in combat readiness, in order to foil possible 
dangers. Being indifferent and in a state of inertia will bring 
serious and unmendable damage to the party's work and the 
nation's interests. 
<H5>  II. It is Necessary To Look Squarely at Tibet's Weak Links </H5>
in Stabilizing the Situation 
  In recent years, party and government organizations at 
various levels in Tibet, particularly the broad masses of cadres 
and policemen on the judicial, procuratorial, and public 
security fronts including public security organs and armed 
police, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet have 
always upheld the principle of "promoting economic construction, 
reform, and opening up, as well as engaging in antisplittist 
struggle and stabilizing the situation." They have vigorously 
and actively launched the antisplittist struggle, forcefully 
dealt a blow at the swollen arrogance of the splittist forces 
inside and outside the region, and made fruitful contributions 
to consolidating the frontier defense, maintaining the 
unification of the motherland, enhancing national unity, 
maintaining a stable situation in Tibet, and ensuring the smooth 
progress of economic construction, reform, and opening up. While 
fully confirming these achievements, however, we should also 
have a clear understanding that there are still some problems 
and inconsistencies in our work for combating splittism and 
stabilizing the situation. They are mainly the inconsistencies 
in ideology and work which are not suitable to the situation and 
remain to be further settled and corrected, so that we may 
better gain the initiative in the antisplittist struggle and 
more effectively intensify the work in stabilizing the situation. 
  First of all, we should look into the inconsistencies in 
ideology. We have talked about the importance and significance 
of a stable situation for years and it should be confirmed that 
the vast majority of our leading cadres have a fairly clear 
understanding of this issue and have attached more importance to 
the work in stabilizing the situation. However, we should also 
be aware that there are, actually, some comrades who do not pay 
enough attention to this issue. Upon hearing the regional party 
committee's repeated emphasis on the work in stabilizing the 
situation, some comrades believed it was just an exaggeration to 
raise an alarm and took exception to it. They lowered their 
guard and became careless in ideology, paid no attention to 
their work, did nothing to implement measures, and paid lip 
service only; even if they did do something, they did it in a 
perfunctory way, just enough to satisfy the demand of the higher 
authorities. Some people even showed disgust at and turned a 
deaf ear to the talk about launching antisplittist struggle and 
stabilizing the situation. Some comrades also maintained: "We 
should concentrate our strength on economic construction at 
present; repeated emphasis on the work for stabilizing the 
situation will affect the economic work; stability and unity 
will naturally be achieved once the economy is developed." Such 
a perception that antagonizes the stable situation against 
economic development and that simply stresses economic work is 
untenable in theory and very harmful, even dangerous, in 
practice. In Tibet, the party's central work is economic 
construction; strengthening a stable situation is exactly the 
work to offer a powerful guarantee for economic construction, 
reform, opening up, and the creation of a good milieu. Stability 
is the premise, reform is the driving force, and development is 
the foundation; the relations among the three should not be 
ignored at any time. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping put it: "China's 
problem is the need for stability, which overrides everything 
else. Without a stable environment, we would achieve nothing 
and lose the achievements we have made. The key to our 
promotion of four modernizations, reform, and opening up lies in 
stability." These expositions of Comrade Xiaoping's have 
incisively expounded the dialectical relations among stability, 
development, and reform. The splittist activities and sabotage 
conducted by splittists inside and outside Tibet are a reality 
independent of our will; only through conducting a firm 
antisplittist struggle and incessant work in strengthening a 
stable situation can we guarantee and promote economic 
development. Meanwhile, only by doing a good job in reform and 
development can we create a material foundation for social 
stability and enhance the cohesiveness among the people. General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin has noted: "Everybody must understand the 
importance of social and political stability in an attitude that 
he or she is highly responsible to the party, the state, and the 
nation, uphold the principle of promoting material civilization 
and socialist ethics at the same time, eliminate the factors 
causing instability in a timely manner, continue to maintain the 
stability of milieu, and ensure the smooth progress of the 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive." Party, 
government, military, and police leaders at various levels 
should all treat deepening reform, accelerating development, and 
maintaining stability as the overall interest of the entire 
party's work. 
  Next, we must be aware of the problems existing in our work 
and measures. Due to subjective and objective reasons, a number 
of problems still exist in our antisplittist struggle and in our 
work to maintain stability. Some of them are comparatively 
serious. For instance, comparatively serious problems exist in 
the propaganda of public opinion and border control. They are 
extremely serious in smoothly waging the struggle against 
splittism, maintaining stability, safeguarding the unification 
of the motherland, and strengthening unity among nationalities. 
Therefore, we must on no account drop our guard against these 
problems or become insensitive to them; we must take strong 
measures to solve them; we must guard against recurrence of 
similar phenomenon. 
  Third, we must be aware of some problems concerning impurity 
and ineffective work on the part of our party members and 
cadres. Because the splittist forces inside and outside Tibet 
use religion to conduct infiltration, some of our party members 
and cadres have lost the ideological consciousness that a 
communist should have. They make concessions and become weak in 
the antisplittist struggle. We must deal with the problem in 
earnest and make vigorous efforts to successfully solve the 
problem existing within the contingents of cadres, staff, and 
workers, so as to ensure their purity, and to guarantee that our 
contingents are invincible in the antisplittist struggle. 
<H5>  III. Take Effective Measures and Practically Improve the </H5>
Work To Maintain Stability 
  At a work conference held by the regional party committee 
and 
the regional people's government in August last year, I proposed 
measures for and raised requirements on improving our 
understanding of the protractedness, complicatedness, and 
arduousness of the antisplittist struggle; improving education 
as well as our ideological and political work; promoting 
development of the party and government organizations at the 
grass-roots level; stepping up propaganda to the outside world; 
improving comprehensive management of public security; giving 
full play to the dictatorship functions of judicial and public 
security departments; strengthening control over temples and 
religious activities; and strengthening leadership over the work 
to maintain stability. These measures and requirements are 
still suitable now. It is necessary for us to further 
practically pay close attention to their implementation. Based 
on these measures and requirements, I would like to express my 
views as follows which are directed against the new situation of 
antisplittist struggle in Tibet. 
  We must further have a clear understanding of the situation, 
seek unity of thinking, and enhance our initiative for the 
antisplittist struggle. So long as the international hostile 
forces and splittists inside and outside Tibet exist, the 
antisplittist struggle shall be carried on for a protracted 
period of time to come. This is an objective law independent of 
our will. Our struggle against splittists inside and outside 
Tibet is, in essence, a class struggle under the new situation. 
The reactionary forces they represent will never resign 
themselves to stepping down from the stage of history. They 
vainly attempt to regain the dominant position they have lost. 
We must keep a clear head against this; we must not, in the 
slightest degree, lower our guard or tend to underestimate the 
enemy. All our party and government organizations at all levels 
must continue to implement in depth the principle of "grasping 
two links at the same time"; always treat the work to maintain 
stability as an important matter and handle it earnestly and 
painstakingly; conscientiously shoulder the political 
responsibility of maintaining stability; and pay close attention 
to doing a good job of waging the antisplittist struggle and 
maintaining stability in a down-to-earth manner while 
successfully carrying out economic construction. The key to the 
success of our work to maintain stability lies in leadership. 
The regional party committee requires party and government 
leaders in all prefectures, cities, and units to personally 
concern themselves with the work to maintain stability; to 
constantly study the situation and problems confronting their 
respective localities and units; to draw up plans; and to lead 
the broad masses of cadres, staff, and workers to vigorously 
wage the antisplittist struggle. In the face of cardinal issues 
of right and wrong, leading cadres must take a clear-cut stand 
and adopt a resolute attitude. The attitude of leading cadres 
to the antisplittist struggle is the fundamental political 
criterion for judging whether they are qualified or not. 
  It is necessary to strengthen ideological and educational 
work for the masses. Splittist elements at home and abroad are 
good at covering up their real face, confusing and poisoning 
people's minds, and influencing public opinion by flaunting the 
national and religious banners and by making a pretense of 
so-called "human rights," "democracy," and "freedom." They are 
notoriously deceitful and inflammatory. We must use various 
public opinion tools and propaganda techniques to make the 
following points clear: the people of Tibetan nationality can 
enjoy happiness today and glory tomorrow only under the 
leadership of the party and inside the great family of the 
motherland; the splittist elements at home and abroad are old 
Tibet's ruling clique who represent the interests of a few serf 
owners and exploiting class; they cruelly oppressed and 
exploited the Tibetan people in the past; they try in every 
possible way to resume their ruling position of the past by 
advocating "Tibet independence"; and the activities engaged in 
by splittist elements at home and abroad will bring about damage 
to the Tibetan people and the development in Tibet. We must 
help the broad masses of the people obtain a better 
understanding of the true class nature and political motivation 
of these people. Resolute efforts should be made to fight 
against their attempts to split the motherland. Tibet is under 
the rule of the Communist Party and will stay that way forever. 
  We must resolutely foil splittist elements' attempts to 
infiltrate into the region through various channels. All 
reactionary propaganda materials brought into the region by 
splittist elements at home and abroad through various channels 
should be confiscated in accordance with law. Any one who 
brings, sells, disseminates, and spreads reactionary propaganda 
materials should be severely dealt with in accordance with law. 
We should take quick action to crack down on severe criminal 
activities. It is necessary to strengthen investigations into 
severe criminal cases such as murders, robberies, drug 
trafficking, and thefts in a bid to increase the case-solving 
percentage, and deal out quick and severe punishment to the 
offenders in accordance with law. We should comprehensively 
consolidate public security and order, and conscientiously carry 
out the principle of "those who are in charge of the affairs 
should be held responsible." Each department should perform 
its own functions well and make sure that all of its personnel 
are honest and integrated. We should conscientiously improve 
the social security order in our region. 
  All localities and units should strengthen ideological and 
political work under their jurisdiction, improve inner 
management, and plug all loopholes. In the light of ideological 
problems existing among workers and staff members, proper 
efforts should be made to conduct, in a timely and thoroughgoing 
fashion, an ideological and political campaign among them. 
Before introducing a reform measure which has great bearing on 
the interests of the people, all departments concerned should 
conduct a propaganda campaign to explain the necessity of the 
measure. No measures should be introduced to the public and put 
into force unless they are approved by the regional CPC 
committee and the government. Under no circumstances shall we 
allow any department or unit to take selfish actions at the 
expense of the people's interests. It is necessary to 
strengthen price supervision so as to invigorate circulation and 
safeguard the interests of the people. We should provide more 
employment opportunities for youths, improve business 
management, enhance economic performance, and increase the 
income of workers, staff members, and residents. Departments 
concerned and governments at all levels should make efforts to 
show their concern about the enterprises experiencing financial 
losses and about workers, staff members, residents, and retired 
personnel with difficulties in their livelihood. These 
organizations should try their best to help them. They should 
try in every possible way to help poverty-stricken households in 
agricultural and pastoral areas, and the people who cannot 
afford to buy grain or medicine. Relevant departments and units 
should try to solve the problems which the people complain about 
strongly, as well as reasonable requests put forward by them. 
If such problems and requests cannot be solved immediately, 
these departments and units should explain this to the people 
and, at the same time, report them to higher authorities. 
  Comrades, we are facing a grim situation in the fight 
against 
splittism, and the arduous task of promoting stability, reform, 
and development. For each and every member of the communist 
party, and leading cadres in particular, this is a severe 
challenge. It is also a test of our party spirit. Every member 
of the Communist Party should take a firm and clear-cut stand in 
the front line of the struggle against splittism. They should 
bring into full play the vanguard and model role as a member of 
the Communist Party by carrying out resolute struggle against 
all moves that try to split the motherland and sabotage the 
unity among all nationalities. We should unite with all the 
forces that can be united, mobilize the enthusiasm of all social 
sectors, strengthen the patriotic united front work on the basis 
of closely relying on the people, and bring into full play the 
special role of patriotic personages of all nationalities and 
all circles, as well as personages in religious circles, in the 
work of fighting against splittism and maintaining stability so 
as to guarantee the healthy and smooth development of reform, 
opening, and economic construction.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--Tibetans seeking 
independence for their country are becoming increasingly active, 
and Chinese Communist Party cadres seem unable to stifle the 
movement, Re Di, president of the autonomous region's people's 
congress has told the Tibet Daily. In some regions an 
increasing number of "reactionary tracts" have appeared, said 
Re, who is also vice-secretary of the Tibetan communist party. 
"Sorcerers and the superstitious (meaning religious leaders of 
the independence movement) distort the facts, peddle rumours and 
criticise our policy by trying to use international pressure," 
he told the paper, copies of which were available in Beijing 
Friday [3 Jun]. 
  He criticised some comrades for not realising the 
seriousness 
of the problems or the importance of their work. "Any 
negligence risks harming the party," said Re in a speech he made 
May 22, one week before demonstrations involving about 200 
people erupted in the capital Lhasa, according to the Tibet 
Information Network. Reactionary propaganda should be opposed 
and separatists and common law criminals severely sanctioned, he 
said. Re, implicitly acknowledging worsening social problems 
which sparked demonstrations last year, urged cadres to pay more 
attention to workers in debt-riddled state companies, the 
retired, and the poor. 
  The authorities are clearly worried that anti-Chinese 
feelings in Tibet will be aggravated by inflation and rising 
unemployment. China annexed Tibet in 1959 after crushing an 
independence uprising. Since 1987 the Tibetan separatist 
movement, led by Buddhist monks and nuns, have stepped up 
anti-Chinese action. Dozens of demonstrators have been killed 
and hundreds arrested, according to international human rights 
organisations.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 5 (XINHUA) -- Over 2,000 children who 
could not afford to continue school have resumed their schooling 
as the region has collected donations totalling two million yuan 
in the "Hope Project", a nationwide program to help drop-outs 
return school. 
  Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the people's government of the 
Tibetan Autonomous Region, said that Tibet has built eight Hope 
schools and two Hope classes with the donations and another 
seven such schools are under construction. 
  But being one of the most underdeveloped parts in China, 
about one third of the school-age children could not afford to 
go to school in Tibet by the end of 1993, he pointed out. This 
mainly arises from Tibet's poor transport conditions, fewer 
schools and poor schooling conditions, he said. 
  In the light of the backward education, the regional 
people's 
government has decided to put education on the top agenda. The 
most concrete step for this move is to build at least one middle 
school in each county and at least one primary school in each 
township so as to provide 80 percent of the region's school-age 
children with proper education. 
  To this end, Gyaincain Norbu called on the efforts of 
different social circles to help build the project, since 
governments at different levels have but small budgets. 
  He suggested some detailed fund-raising ideas, such as 
auctions, benefit performances and charity bazaars, which have 
already proved effective in other parts of China.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 3 (XINHUA) -- This east China 
metropolis claims to have the most private enterprises of any 
major city in the country. 
  According to statistics, Shanghai, China's largest economic 
center, had over 10,000 private businesses by mid-May this year, 
up 20 percent over the end of last year. 
  The amount of registered capital rose by 30 percent from 
210,000 yuan last December to 275,000 yuan at present. 
  The industrial structure of the private economy is 
developing 
from processing industry and service trades to high-tech 
industry and science and technology. 
  At present, the city has 720 private businesses specializing 
in scientific development, 3,000 private companies (ten times as 
many as two years ago) and several dozen Sino-foreign

provided with high-class infrastructural facilities and 
investment conditions. 
  Last year saw these private business generate an output 
value 
totalling 1.115 billion yuan. The sales volume of social 
commodities amounted to 3.4 billion yuan-worth.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is striving to 
regain its position as an international financial center, 
according to Mao Yingliang, president of the municipal branch of 
the People's Bank of China. 
  According to its plan, Shanghai will expand its monetary 
market (China's largest), securities market, foreign exchange 
market and insurance market, and open a gold market and a free 
on board (FOB) market. 
  "To attain its strategic objective, Shanghai must further 
reform its economic system and open wider to the outside world 
while speeding up construction of its infrastructure 
facilities," Mao said. 
  "Only by improving and fostering the market economy step by 
step, can the banking reform be deepened and a standardized 
international banking center be formed," he noted. 
  In addition, according to Mao, the modern banking system 
needs to be coordinated with the modern enterprise system and 
banking laws brought into line with international conventions. 
  At present, the Chinese Government is widely soliciting 
opinions in order to formulate a package of laws covering the 
operations of the central and commercial banks, securities and 
the banking market, which are expected to come into effect soon. 
  Mao disclosed that, to develop the metropolis into an 
international financial center, Shanghai's banking 
organizations, under the leadership of the central bank, have 
decided to compete with overseas banking organizations. 
  "Shanghai, China's largest economic center, is becoming the 
country's largest monetary, securities, foreign exchange and 
insurance market," the president said. 
  He explained that the monetary market, in terms of 
inter-bank 
loans, will make maximum use of short-term floating loans 
between Shanghai and its nearby provinces. 
  Mao urged the Shanghai Stock Exchange to further standardize 
and internationalize its operation so as to become a first-class 
securities collection and distribution center in the Asian and 
Pacific region. 
  The China Foreign Exchange Center, located in Shanghai, is 
being encouraged to promote the stabilization of the renminbi 
exchange rate to allow free convertibility. 
  Mao also called for the expansion of the insurance, gold and 
FOB markets -- which started later than other banking markets -- 
the golden card project and the city clearing and settlement 
system. 
  According to Mao, the Shanghai International Financial 
Center 
is being developed in three stages; construction of the first 
stage will be completed in 1995, that of the second in 2000 and 
that of the third in 2010.

  [Text] Learned by this reporter from the provincial 
meeting on social insurance of government organs and 
institutions, held in Jinan on 1 June, Shandong Province will, 
beginning this year, carry out the social insurance system among 
all government organs and institutions. As disclosed by this 
meeting, the social insurance programs carried out among 
government organs and institutions include the old-age pension 
insurance, the unemployment insurance, the workers' injuries and 
disability insurance, and the child-bearing insurance. At 
present, the old-age pension insurance and the unemployment 
insurance will be carried out first. And, these two insurance 
systems will be carried out among working personnel of all 
levels of party, government, and mass organizations, all social 
groups, all state-owned institutions, and all the central units 
stationed in Shandong as well as among the non-army working 
personnel of the units that are affiliated with the army and 
stationed in Shandong. 
  According to stipulations, the raising of the fund for the 
old-age pension insurance should be borne by the state, units, 
and individuals in common. Of this fund, the portion borne by 
individuals should be raised by collecting 2 percent of 
individuals' month salaries and the amount should be gradually 
increased along with their wage increases. 
  The meeting pointed out: Establishing and perfecting the 
social insurance system among government organs and institutions 
is a reform with grave difficulties. All cities and prefectures 
as well as all units should be meticulous in organizing this 
work and should lose no time to make this work a success in line 
with the unified disposition of the provincial party committee 
and the provincial government with a view to promoting the 
development of the socialist market economy and promoting the 
stability of society.

<F P=106> [Report by Du Yinghua (2629 5391 5478): "Unify Thinking, </F>
Enhance Understanding, and Maintain a Sustained and Good 
Economic Development Trend"] 
  [Text] This morning, the provincial government held a forum 
on banking work. Vice Governor Guo Shichang relayed the 
guidelines of a speech given by Zhu Rongji, member of the 
standing committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and vice premier of the State Council, at the forum on 
economic work of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces recently 
held in Zhengzhou. Governor Ye Liansong presided over the forum 
and devised plans for implementing the guidelines of Zhu 
Rongji's speech. 
  Attending today's forum were responsible comrades of the 
provincial Planning Commission, the provincial Economic and 
Trade Commission, the provincial-level departments in charge of 
comprehensive work, and various provincial, city (prefectural), 
and county (city) banking departments, a total of more than 800 
people. 
  This year is crucial for our country to conduct the package 
reform with breakthroughs in key areas. In line with the 
general principle of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability," the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government have upheld the overall thinking of using reform to 
promote development and development to maintain stability. On 
the basis of achieving a fairly rapid national economic 
development throughout the province last year, we have continued 
to maintain a fairly good development trend. The agricultural 
development situation has been better than that of last year, 
industry has increased at a definite rate, fixed asset 
investments have declined after experiencing vast increases, the 
consumer goods market has been stable, foreign export trade has 
increased normally, financial revenues have increased fairly 
rapidly, the financial order has been fairly good, the savings 
deposits have increased by a large margin, the whole reform has 
been smoothly carried out, and the economic and social 
situations have been quite stable. 
  How to do a further and better job in banking work and how 
to 
support economic development under the new situation? The forum 
stressed: At present, the banking departments should 
conscientiously study the guidelines of Zhu Rongji's speech 
given at the economic work forum held in Zhengzhou, enhance 
understanding, unify thinking, place the work emphasis on 
grasping agricultural production and state-owned enterprises, 
properly handle the relations of reform, development, and 
stability, actively support economic work, and develop an 
excellent situation in our province. 
  The forum called on responsible comrades of banks at all 
levels to go down to the grass-roots units to conduct 
investigation and study, be eager to meet the needs for 
production, and help enterprises eliminate misgivings and 
difficulties. It is necessary to adopt practical and effective 
measures, issue funds in line with the state stipulations, step 
up efforts to issue the set amount of funds to enterprises in a 
timely manner, and make full use of the funds. 
  Banks should fully support enterprises whose products have 
markets, enjoy good sales, and yield efficiency, and whose 
payment for goods can be recovered. Banks should also grant 
loans to money-losing enterprises whose products can find a good 
market and can yield economic returns. Banking departments 
should maintain good coordination with the local economic 
departments, help enterprises readjust the product mix, promote 
the sales of stockpiled goods, and enable enterprises to end 
deficits and to extricate themselves from a difficult position. 
However, we must not support them to produce stockpiled goods. 
Enterprises running in the red for a long time and have no hope 
of ending deficits should realistically prepare for declaring 
bankruptcy in line with the law. 
  At present, the time for summer grain harvest is 
approaching. 
The forum called on all banks to try by every possible means to 
prepare for the purchase of summer grain and oil-bearing crops, 
give priority to guaranteeing funds for purchasing farm and 
sideline products, particularly grain, and make resolute efforts 
not to issue "IOU" slips. Meanwhile, all departments should 
strengthen management over the grain and oil-bearing crops 
markets and safeguard a normal order for purchase. Once when 
the "grain bags," and "vegetable baskets" are firmly grasped, 
the markets and the society will be stable. 
  In conclusion, Ye Liansong said earnestly: Banking 
departments have occupied a very important position in building 
the socialist modernization and an economically strong province, 
shouldering very heavy tasks. The broad masses of workers on 
the financial front have made outstanding contributions to our 
province's economic construction. The provincial party 
committee and government have pinned great hopes on them. It is 
hoped that all of you will unify thinking, deepen understanding, 
do your work well, and promote development.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 4 (XINHUA) -- A freight train 
carrying 300 tons of goods left the new customs depot here for 
Hong Kong at 10 A.M. on Tuesday [31 May], marking the formal 
opening of the new inland customs post. 
  Shijiazhuang is the capital of Hebei Province in north 
China. 
The new customs depot includes two warehouses and a whole range 
of services regarding imports and exports, commodity inspection 
and quarantine. 
  Customs officials said that goods passed by the depot will 
travel direct in sealed railway trucks and containers to their 
customers in Russia, Hong Kong, Macao and South-East Asian 
nations, without needing to go through other Chinese customs 
formalities further along their route. 
  Goods on their way to Russia, north and East Europe via the 
Euro- Asian Continental Rail Bridge can also clear their custom 
formalities at the depot, said the officials. 
  It is understood that the opening of the facility will 
greatly help Hebei Province's 400 state-owned firms and 4,300 
joint ventures with direct import and export businesses. 
  The officials believe that some enterprises in the 
neighbouring Shanxi and Henan Provinces will also choose to 
export their goods via the new customs depot.

Provincial Financial Department: "The Basic Principles and 
Contents of the Tax Distribution System"] 
  [Text] Our province reforms the financial management system 
by carrying out the system of distribution of taxes between the 
province and cities and counties basically in line with the 
principles as follows: First, we should persist in the 
principle of giving consideration to the interests of both the 
province and cities and counties. The province should not only 
ensure the reasonable increase in the province's revenues to 
enhance the provincial government's ability in macroeconomic 
regulation and control, but also take into consideration the 
interests of cities and counties to mobilize their enthusiasm 
for developing the economy, increasing revenues, and reducing 
expenditures. According to the provincial party committee's 
guiding ideology that to make the province rich, we must first 
make the grass roots rich, we must ensure that three aspects 
must not be changed when the new tax distribution system is 
carried out. That is, the original pattern of distribution of 
interests between the province and cities and counties must not 
be changed; the basic frame of the tax distribution system, 
defined by the central financial department, must not be 
changed; and the ratio of revenues shared by the province and 
cities and counties as defined by the central financial 
department as well as the coefficient of the progressive 
increase rate of the refund on tax revenues must not be 
readjusted. 
  Second, we should persist in the principle of linking 
unified 
policies with management by various layers. The legislative 
powers of central taxes, sharing taxes, and some important local 
taxes as defined by the central financial department must be 
concentrated in the central financial department so as to ensure 
the unified implementation of government decrees and to 
safeguard the coordination of markets throughout the country and 
the equal competition between enterprises. Tax revenues should 
be collected and managed by various layers. Central taxes and 
sharing taxes should be collected on a responsibility basis by 
the central tax affairs organization. Of the sharing taxes, the 
portions obtained by the localities should directly be 
distributed to the treasuries at various layers by the central 
tax affairs organization. The local taxes should be collected 
on a responsibility basis by the local tax affairs organizations 
at various levels. The revenues that belong to the provincial 
level should directly be transferred to the provincial treasury. 
  Third, we should persist in the principle of combining 
overall design with step-by-step advance. On the basis of 
defining reform targets, the central financial department should 
define to set up the basic frame of the tax distribution system 
through step-by-step reforms and to perfect the system in a 
step-by-step manner in the course of implementation. The 
methods for division of revenues, refund on tax revenues, and 
transfer of payments should be standardized throughout the 
country. So far, we should first divide major tax categories 
and standardize, in a step-by-step manner, the division of other 
revenues. In the course of transition from the old tax system 
to the new one, items on subsidies, delivery to higher levels, 
and some accounts as stipulated in the old tax system should 
continue to be implemented. 
  The specific contents of this new tax system are as follows: 
First, division of revenues -- Revenues should be divided 
between the province and cities and counties according to the 
power to manage affairs exercised by the province, cities, and 
counties and in line with tax categories. The provincial 
level's fixed revenues include the income taxes of 
provincial-level enterprises (excluding the income taxes of 
local and foreign-funded banks and nonbanking monetary 
enterprises), the profits handed over to higher levels by these 
enterprises, the income taxes of the grain enterprises under the 
special management of the province, the profits handed over to 
higher levels by these enterprises, the regulatory taxes on the 
orientation of the investment in fixed assets, the business 
taxes paid by the banks at various levels and the insurance 
departments, the taxes on natural resources, and some other 
provincial-level revenues. The revenues paid by Daqing city 
(excluding three counties) should temporarily be divided 
according to the original methods. 
  The fixed revenues of the city- and county-level financial 
departments (excluding that of Daqing city) include the income 
taxes of local enterprises (excluding the income taxes of local 
and foreign-funded banks and nonbanking monetary enterprises), 
the profits handed over to higher levels by local enterprises, 
the income taxes of individuals, and the taxes on utilization of 
urban land. Taxes for city maintenance and construction 
(excluding the portions concentratively paid by head offices of 
banks, railway departments, and general insurance companies), 
the taxes for real estate, the taxes for use of vehicles and 
ships, stamp taxes, the taxes on slaughtering animals, the taxes 
on agriculture and animal husbandry, the taxes on special 
agricultural products, the taxes on occupation of cultivated 
areas, the taxes for contracts, and the revenues from paid use 
of state-owned land. 
  Revenues shared by the province with cities and counties 
are as follows: The 25 percent of the value added tax paid by 
petroleum, power, petrochemical, and nonferrous metal 
departments to be retained by the local authorities belongs to 
the provincial-level revenue. The 25 percent of the value added 
tax paid by enterprises to be retained by local authorities is 
shared by the province with cities and counties 50 to 50 
percent, the same ratio as they shared the former indirect tax. 
Business tax (excluding the business tax paid by the head 
offices of banks, railway departments, and head offices of 
insurance companies), inheritance tax, bequest tax, land value 
added tax, and the agricultural tax resulting from increase of 
grain price are shared by the province and cities (counties) 50 
to 50 percent. 
  Second, division of the expenditure -- Based on the division 
of power between the provincial government and city and county 
government, the provincial finance department chiefly takes 
charge of the expenses needed in the operation of 
provincial-level state organs, the expenditures needed in 
restructuring the economy, coordinating the development of 
various localities, and exercising macro regulation and control, 
and the expenditures on the development of the undertakings 
directly managed by the province. City and county finance 
departments take charge of the expenses needed in the operation 
of local organs of political power and the expenses needed in 
the development of the local economy and other undertakings. 
  Third, delimitation of the tax revenues returned by the 
provincial finance department to cities and counties. To 
maintain the vested interest of cities and counties and 
gradually attain the goals of the reform, the amount of the tax 
revenues to be returned by the province to cities and counties 
is determined with 1993 as the base period. Based on the actual 
1993 revenues of various localities, the tax reform conditions, 
and the division of revenues among the central, provincial, and 
city and county authorities, the net revenues turned over to the 
central authorities and the province by various localities are 
determined (namely consumption tax plus 75 percent of the value 
added tax plus the part to be retained by the province of the 
revenues shared by the province with cities and counties minus 
the revenues refunded by the central authorities and the 
province to cities and counties). The net revenues turned over 
to higher authorities by various localities in 1993 are all 
returned to the localities to ensure their vested financial 
strength, and the amount will be taken as the base figure of the 
tax revenues to be returned by the province to various 
localities in the future. Beginning 1994, the tax revenues to be 
returned will increase every year based on the 1993 base figure. 
The increase rate is determined on the basis of the coefficient 
of 1:0.3 of the average growth rate of the province's value 
added tax and consumption tax. That is, when the average growth 
rate of these two types of taxes rises by 1 percent, the tax 
revenues to be returned to cities and counties should grow by 
0.3 percent. After 1994, when the net revenues turned over to 
the central authorities and the province are lower than the 1993 
base figure, the tax revenues to be returned to cities and 
counties will be reduced accordingly. The measures for the 
central authorities to return tax revenues to the province 
remain unchanged. 
  Fourth, the handling of the fixed-quota subsidies, the 
revenues to be turned over to higher authorities according to 
systems, revenues to be turned over to higher authorities for 
special purposes, and matters related to final accounts. In 
line with the central guidelines of "keeping the distribution 
pattern of the original system unchanged for some time after 
implementation of the tax distribution system and gradually 
standardizing the work after a transitional period," the 
fixed-quota subsidies from the province to cities and counties 
according to the original system will continue; and the 
progressive decrease of the fixed-quota subsidies applied to 
some cities and counties will remain unchanged. The various 
revenues to be turned over to higher authorities according to 
the original system will continue; the progressive increase of 
the revenues to be turned over to higher authorities applied to 
some cities and counties will also continue, and this method 
will be applied for the time being to the prefectures and cities 
which retain a certain amount of the total. A progressive 
increase rate will be determined based on the actual amount 
turned over to higher authorities by these prefectures and 
cities in 1993, and these prefectures and cities will hand 
revenues over to higher authorities according to this 
progressive increase rate every year.

  [Text] Our province will carry out comprehensive supporting 
reform of the regional labor system in an all-around manner. 
This was proposed at the provincial conference on reform of the 
labor system held in Anshan on 18 May. 
  The provincial labor department proposed: This year we 
should regard reform of the labor employment system as the 
breakthrough point, carry out comprehensive supporting reform of 
the regional labor system in an all-around manner, accelerate 
the pace of implementing the all-member labor contract system; 
and make reform serve the whole region, enterprises of various 
ownerships, and all staff members and workers. Meanwhile, it is 
necessary to take active but prudent steps to make arrangements 
for enterprise surplus workers, help unemployed and job-seekers 
find jobs again, and implement the integrated social security 
system in all places. Through regional supporting reform, we 
should gradually establish an enterprise internal wages 
distribution method that meets the needs of the market economy, 
and implement the wage system under which the wage standards are 
determined by the markets and enterprises are allowed to 
distribute wages independently while taking supervision, 
regulation, and control from the government, break the ownership 
and regional limits, and promote the formation of regional labor 
markets.

  [Excerpts] The 1994 work for placing Army officers 
transferred to civilian work is about to begin. On 23 May in 
Shenyang, the provincial authorities held a meeting on placement 
of Army officers transferred to civilian work to relay the 
guidelines of the national meeting on placement of Army officers 
transferred to civilian work and to arrange for the province's 
work in placing such officers. [passage omitted] 
  Liaoning has always been a province placing relatively more 
Army officers transferred to civilian work. Last year, the 
province satisfactorily fulfilled the task of placing 5,400 
transferred Army officers and 590 spouses of such officers, and 
95 percent of such officers were trained to improve their 
adaptability and professional skills. By combining the placement 
of transferred Army officers with the endeavor of facilitating 
the "second pioneering program," the province witnessed a 
remarkable increase in the number of the transferred Army 
officers who were working for state-owned enterprises, 
foreign-invested enterprises, and township-, town-, district-, 
and neighborhood-run enterprises; who initiated economic 
entities; and who sought employment by themselves. Of them, 177 
officers were self-employed, surpassing the total sum over the 
past 15 years since the commencement of reform and opening up. 
This year, the province has been assigned with the task of 
placing 3,700 Army officers transferred to civilian work. Of 
them, the officers below the age of 40 account for 77 percent, 
officers having received the education of specialized secondary 
school, college, and institutions of even higher levels account 
for 59 percent, and the officers mastering various kinds of 
skills account for 25 percent. 
  On behalf of the provincial group for placement of Army 
officers transferred to civilian work, Xiao Zuofu summarized 
last year's situation in placing transferred Army officers and 
set demands for this year's work. He pointed out: Party 
committees and governments at all levels should, with a high 
degree of the sense of political responsibility, conscientiously 
accomplish the task of placing Army officers transferred to 
civilian work, should make great efforts to maintain the 
stability and continuity of the related policies, and should 
actively explore the new ways of appropriately placing such 
officers under the condition of the socialist market economy. 
With emphasis on the first line of economic construction, such 
officers should be primarily transferred to judicial and public 
security departments, industrial and commercial departments, tax 
departments, and financial departments. In particular, such 
officers should be guided to work for enterprises and the places 
they are needed. This year, the above-mentioned departments 
should fill their vacant positions with such officers on a 
priority basis, and the proportion of such officers should not 
be less than 15 percent of their personnel increase quota. 
Other departments should also fill their vacant positions with 
the Army officers transferred to civilian work on a priority 
basis. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Shenyang, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in north-east 
China's Liaoning Province are contracting more land and spending 
more money to grow grain -- as a result of recent grain price 
rises in many parts of China. 
  Many farmers who left their land to seek jobs in urban areas 
came back in the first few months of the year to take a contract 
for farmland again. They were also buying more chemical 
fertilizers and collecting farmyard manure. 
  "I am accustomed to cultivating land, but in the past 
several 
years, a whole year's income from farming was nothing compared 
with what you gained by working several months in town," 
complained Zhou Huiyao, a 52-year-old farmer in Shigangzi 
Village in Yangshipu Township in Liaozhong County. 
  In the past, the farmer had contracted some 3.3 ha of fields 
at the most. However, the acreage decreased year by year to 
less than 1.3 ha last year. This year, he contracted four ha of 
land. 
  "I regret that I did not plant enough grain last year. I did 
not expect the price of grain to go up that much," Zhou said. 
"So I have increased my grain planting acreage this year and 
asked my sons to help me at home rather than let them go to seek 
jobs in town." 
  The experienced farmer calculated that he would make about 
3,000 yuan net profits per ha in the autumn, despite the rise in 
price of chemical fertilizer and other expenses. 
  Liang Jihua, deputy director of the Liaozhong County 
Agricultural Bureau, said that this year the county was seeing 
the greatest farming enthusiasm since 1984. 
  Land totalling some 6,700 ha, including some sandy land, has 
been leased out to farmers this year, four times as much as last 
year. 
  Farmers across the province are pouring more investments 
into 
farming. Some two million tons of chemical fertilizer, similar 
to the amount sold last year, have already been sold, but 
experts said they expect farmers will buy more. 
  Farmyard and other manure, once deserted by farmers, is 
again 
become popular with local farmers. 
  Liu Laifu, a farmer in Chengguan Village in Changtu County, 
for instance, spent 500 yuan to build a public latrine in the 
county town to collect manure. More than a dozen farmers have 
followed suit. 
  Provincial officials were happy with the farming enthusiasm. 
  The whole province will have three million ha planted with 
grain and soy beans. A leading official of the provincial 
agricultural bureau, said that he expects the province's total 
grain output will top the record of 12.5 million tons, if no 
major natural disaster occurs.

  [Text] According to the data revealed at the first 
provincial conference on economic crimes on 10 May, the 
departments in charge of economic crime investigation under the 
public security organs at all levels across the province have 
persistently regarded the work of dealing blows at economic 
crimes as an important task over the past six years since the 
establishment of these departments. By concentrating their 
efforts on investigating and cracking down on serious and 
appalling economic cases, they have recovered the embezzled 
money and articles worth more than 1.05 billion yuan Renminbi 
and retrieved a tremendous amount of economic losses for the 
state in a timely manner. 
  Economic offenders are criminals with strong covertness. As 
a heavy industrial base in the country, Liaoning Province has 
more than 1,000 large and medium-sized enterprises. Under the 
condition of building a market economic structure, these 
enterprises are shifting their track; changing their style; and 
entering the markets. During the period, various social 
problems caused by the economy have steadily cropped up and 
economic swindling cases in some localities have rapidly 
increased. Of these cases, serious and appalling ones have 
sharply increased and the volume of funds involved in these 
cases has become increasingly large. In 1993 the province as a 
whole incurred 85 economic cases and each of them involved more 
than 1 million yuan. Of these cases, 10 involved more than 10 
million yuan. The province's number of such cases has been rare 
since the founding of the PRC. 
  By regarding the work of safeguarding the economic order as 
their own duty and persistently regarding the cases that are 
exerting large harm and influence as the focal points of attack, 
the departments in charge of economic crime investigation under 
the public security organs throughout the province have 
investigated and wound up more than 10,000 cases of various 
economic crimes by adopting effective measures and methods and 
boldly overcoming the difficulties. They have arrested more 
than 9,000 criminal elements and recovered a large amount of 
funds and articles for the state. Recently, Vice Governor Cong 
Zhenglong paid a special visit to the provincial public security 
department to speak highly of the achievements scored by the 
departments in charge of economic crime investigation under the 
public security organs across the province.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Gansu Province and 
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, both in the northwest hinterland, 
have both registered rapid growth in foreign trade, according to 
their officials participated at an international trade fair 
being held here. 
  Gansu Province registered 280 million U.S. dollars in 
exports 
last year and is expected to boost its annual export volume to 
330 million U.S. dollars this year. 
  With over 1000 foreign-funded enterprises, the province has 
significantly raised the export volume of finished products in 
the petroleum and chemical industries, electronics, textiles and 
garments, while sales of raw materials such as grain, edible oil 
and Chinese medicine have declined. 
  In Ningxia, a small Muslim province, exports surpassed 100 
million U.S. dollars for the first in 1993 with minerals and 
farm and sideline products such as ferrosilicon, coal and 
cashmere leading the region's exports. 
  To further exploit domestic and overseas market, Ningxia has 
established trade offices across China and in the United States, 
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

  [Text] Lanzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Two wild horses are due 
to be born at a breeding farm in the north-west desert -- good 
news for the species at the brink of extinction worldwide. 
  There are only 900 of this breed of horses left all over the 
world, according to a report from the International Wild Horse 
Association. 
  The two pregnant mares are being taken care of in Gansu 
Province by the endangered wild life breeding center, which lies 
in the heart of the Tenggeli Desert. 
  Years ago the wild horse almost became extinct in China -- 
its original birth place. The rescue work started in 1988 when 
the center imported ten horses from the United States and 
Germany. Now altogether 16 horses live in this desert, which 
has nearly half of its area green-covered. 
  Other wildlife, such as saiga antelope, Asiatic wild ass, 
takin, wild camel, gold-haired monkey and white-lipped deer, 
have also found their paradise here. 
  In the monkey village, the youngest is only one month old 
while the oldest is the 13-year-old king. 
  The breeding center will be extended to 6,600 hectares this 
autumn.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Xinjiang News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Speaking at a regional united front work 
conference, which ended yesterday, Abulaiti Abudurexiti, deputy 
secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the 
regional government, emphasized: We must strengthen the party's 
leadership over united front work, firmly grasp the magic weapon 
of united front, and relentlessly promote work related to ethnic 
and religious affairs. 
  He said: Xinjiang, the motherland's northwestern frontier, 
is a region where various nationalities live in compact 
communities. Strengthening the unity of various nationalities is 
essential for consolidating and developing the socialist 
relationship between nationalities and maintaining social and 
political stability in the region. This is the prerequisite and 
guarantee for doing a good job in the work of all fields in 
Xinjiang; and herein lies the vital interests of the people of 
all nationalities in the region. Party and government organs at 
all levels and their leaders must comprehensively and correctly 
implement the party's policy toward ethnic minorities, 
conscientiously foster an awareness of the legal system and 
policies, and persist in doing things according to laws and 
policies. They should periodically check the progress in 
implementing the policy toward minority nationalities and 
promptly solve problems whenever they are discovered. 
  He pointed out: Economic construction is the central task 
for the whole party membership, as well as for the work related 
to ethnic affairs. We must work hard and self-reliantly and, in 
light of Xinjiang's realities, fully utilize our advantages to 
continually build up our capability for self-development and to 
accelerate economic development. 
  Discussing religious activities in Xinjiang, he said: The 
situation of work related to religion is generally good. The 
party's policy concerning religion has been further implemented, 
while religious activities are basically conducted according to 
the law. Religious believers at large support the party's 
policy of reform and opening up, and they have made their share 
of contributions to Xinjiang's social stability and economic 
development. We will continue to improve work related to 
religion, and implement the religious freedom policy in an 
all-round manner. While publicizing and implementing the 
religious freedom policy, we must pay keen attention to overcome 
bias in the understanding and oversimplication in the 
implementation. We must earnestly implement the State Council's 
regulations on the management of religious venues and the 
regulations on foreigners' religious activities in the PRC, as 
well as the regional regulations governing religious activities, 
so as to continuously strengthen the management of religious 
affairs according to the law and make sure that religious 
activities are in line with the socialist cause. 
  He emphasized: Party committees and governments at all 
levels and leading party cadres must thoroughly understand that 
ethnic and religions affairs are not trivial matters. We will 
continue to focus our attention on ethnic and religious affairs 
and make unremitting efforts to promote ethnic and religious 
work to lay a more solid social foundation for ensuring 
Xinjiang's long-term political stability and order and economic 
take-off. 
  Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee, said: All party members, leading cadres at all 
levels in particular, should study once again general and 
specific policies related to united front work. They should 
obtain a better understanding, unify the thinking, and ensure 
the implementation of the policies. They should also work out 
effective and feasible suggestions and measures for the 
implementation of the policies in light of local realities, 
thereby creating a new situation in Xinjiang's united front 
work. [video shows close shots of Zhang Fusen, Wang Lequan, and 
other regional leaders] 
  Regional party, government, and military leaders Wang 
Lequan, 
Hailiqiemu Silamu, Pan Zhaomin, (Li Fengzi), (Abudureyimu 
Amiti), Hederbai, Yusufu Aisha, Feng Dazhen, and Wu Jiahe 
attended the conference.

<F P=106> [Article by An Mu (1344 2606): "Military Exercises Targeted </F>
at Taiwan"] 
  [Text] Military Exercises Aimed at "Liberating 
Taiwan" Have Abruptly Increased 
  The relations between the two sides have become tense 
because 
of the Qiandao Hu incident. 
  In the previous issue of CHENG MING, I reported that Li 
Teng-hui's description of the mainland government as "a bandit 
government" infuriated the mainland high-level military 
leadership; they were so infuriated that Deng Xiaoping had to 
come out to calm them down. But this did not remove the tense 
atmosphere of "liberating Taiwan." In April the mainland armed 
forces frequently conducted military exercises and the purpose 
of many of these military exercises was to deal with 
"contingencies" caused by Taiwan. We can see that although Deng 
Xiaoping has supreme authority, he is physically weak. Whereas 
Jiang Zemin, the nominal chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, has no significant position at all in the military. 
As a matter of fact, these military exercises had been proposed 
by hard-liners in the military. This is a trend which merits our 
attention. 
<H5>  The Beijing Military Region's Air Units and Armored Troops </H5>
Cooperated With Each Other in Combat Exercises 
  Let me relate these large-scale military exercises: 
  Time: From 2 to 5 April. 
  Place: Border areas between Hebei Province and Inner 
Mongolia, including Yanghe, Xilugahe, and Xibohe. 
  Participating armed forces units: The Beijing Military 
Region's air units and armored troops. 
  Code of exercises: "Conquest 96." The figure refers to 96 
hours, that is, four days. But some people said it indicated 
the conquest and liberation of the enemy-occupied 
territory--Taiwan--in 1996. I believe the former is more 
accurate. 
  Scale of exercises: Two helicopter regiments, one armored 
division, and one amphibious armored regiment (also called a 
special armored regiment). The helicopters used were Type-8 and 
Type-9 Chinese-made helicopters. The missiles launched by these 
helicopters against the enemy were antitank missiles made after 
the "HOT [Haut subsonique Optiquement teleguide tire d'un 
Tube]" pattern, temporarily called "Little Overlord Type-1." 
These were helicopter-to-ground laser missiles. As learned, 
their accuracy was over 95 percent, but their accuracy with 
mobile targets was 70 percent. 
<H5>  Zhang Wannian: "Proceed From Actual Combat To Crush Taiwan </H5>
Independence" Technical experts from the Army Aviation 
School, the Military Academy of the Second Artillery Corps, and 
the No. 8641 Factory were invited to watch and draw experience 
from these military exercises. Liu Huaqing, Zhang Wannian, Zhao 
Nanqi, Li Laizhu, and Gu Shanqing were present to provide 
guidance. Zhang Wannian said: In the current military 
exercises, first, we will examine the armed forces' training 
quality; second, we have proceeded from the possible outbreak of 
antiaggressive war in the future and from the actual need to 
liberate Taiwan and crush Taiwan independence; and third, we 
will check the quality of new weapons through combat exercises. 
  As learned, the Type-8 helicopters were modeled on the 
French 
"Super Wasp" and the Type-9 helicopters were modeled on the 
French "Dolphin." There are now 200 Type-8 helicopters and 300 
Type-9 helicopters in service. 
  From Zhang Wannian's speech, we know that improving the 
"actual combat" effectiveness is an urgent task of the mainland 
armed forces. Apart from Taiwan, what other imaginary enemies 
does the CPC have? Let us take a look at the following military 
exercises. 
<H5>  The Jinan and Nanjing Military Regions Cooperated With Each </H5>
Other in Combat Exercises 
  Time: From 8 to 12 April. 
  Place: Xiaoqinghe in the north Shandong plains. 
  Participating armed forces units: Armed forces units from 
the Jinan and Nanjing Military Regions. 
  Code of exercises: "Train of the Era," internally called 
"Spirit of the Era." 
  Scale of exercises: The 87th and 116th Divisions of the 54th 
Group Army under the Jinan Military Regional Command--two crack 
infantry units which performed meritorious service during the 
Korean war; one ground-to-air mobile missile regiment belonging 
to the 28th Regiment. 
  The Nanjing Military Region dispatched one airborne division 
and one mechanized division; the airborne division was formed in 
September last year and some of its officers and soldiers were 
transferred from the Jinan Military Region's Air Force School; 
Yun-12 and BHE [preceding three letters published in Roman 
alphabet]-Type [as published] transportation planes were used to 
transport airborne troops. 
  Military Exercises Were Conducted Out of 
Consideration For Changes in the World and Taiwan Situations 
  Zhang Zhen, Li Desheng, Gu Hui, and Zhang Taiji watched 
these 
military exercises. Gu Hui made a concluding speech at the end 
of the exercises, saying: These actual combat exercises were 
planned according to changes in the world and Taiwan political 
situations. For a period to come, the main basis for us to 
strengthen the armed forces buildup and do a good job in combat 
readiness is the existence of hegemonism, the restoration of 
Japanese militarism, and the growth of Li Teng-hui's Taiwan 
independence force. 
  This was quite rare that a Chinese leader had formally 
mentioned the "restoration of Japanese militarism." This was, 
possibly, because the Japanese Government said that the CPC was 
behind North Korea's nuclear threat and a member of the newly 
formed Tsutomo Hata cabinet denied the massacre in Nanjing. 
Apart from this, for historical and geographical reasons, Japan 
is opposed to the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan. All 
this has put the CPC on the alert. 
<H5>  Joint Maneuvers by the Chengdu and Guangzhou Military Regions </H5>
  What is noteworthy is that the "idea of war preparedness" is 
beginning to spread among the mainland armed forces units. The 
reappearance of this obsolete slogan indicates the CPC's firmer 
determination to "liberate Taiwan." 
  The actual combat exercises listed below suggest how the CPC 
focuses on training which is aimed at "scoring a victory in a 
new war confrontation." 
  Time: From 25 to 28 April. 
  Place: Jiangkou and Jinjiang in Tongren Prefecture, Guizhou 
Province; and the lower reaches of the Yuan Jiang, Hunan 
Province. 
  Participating armed forces units: Armed forces units from 
the Guangzhou and Chengdu Military Regions, which carried out 
joint air and land offensives. 
  Code of exercises: "Doomsday of the Aircraft Carrier." "The 
aircraft carrier," reportedly, referred to Taiwan Province. 
  Scale of exercises: The Chengdu Military Region dispatched 
two mechanized infantry divisions, which, covered by an air 
force unit, attacked and occupied an enemy position. The 
Guangzhou Military Region dispatched two infantry divisions, 
which speedily occupied a "city" in Chenshui in the Yuan Jiang's 
lower reaches under bombers' attacks. Troops dispatched by the 
two military regions successfully joined forces. Bombers 
launched laser-guided bombs at their "targets." This was the 
first time laser-guided bombs were used. 
<H5>  Laser Missiles Were Used For the First Time </H5>
  As learned, these laser missiles can be launched against a 
target 15 km away and have high precision and a strong striking 
power. 
  But whether or not the design could meet the requirements of 
"actual combat" had drawn the military's attention. The 
Operational Section of the General Staff Department held an 
on-site meeting to analyze the combat exercises and experts from 
the Military Equipment Department came to inspect how the 
weapons were used. 
  Among those present on the scene were Li Xilin, commander of 
the Guangzhou Military Region; Li Jiulong, commander of the 
Chengdu Military Region; Zhang Xusan, adviser to the Academy of 
Military Sciences; as well as Li Jijun and He Pengfei from the 
Central Military Commission Office. 
  Li Xilin made these remarks: The present-day world is not 
tranquil, hegemonists are acting as international police and are 
threatening world and regional peace, and Li Teng-hui's Taiwan 
independence force is becoming increasingly arrogant. To 
safeguard the motherland's territorial integrity and our 
socialist construction, to liberate our sacred territory Taiwan, 
and to realize the motherland's reunification, we must speed up 
the armed forces' modernization through self-reliance. 
<H5>  "The Military Exercises Have Met the First-Rate Standards of </H5>
Actual Combat" At the conclusion of the military exercises, 
Li Jijun commended the participating troops on behalf of the 
Central Military Commission. He said that the military 
exercises had met the first- rate standards of actual combat; 
the role of new tactics and new equipment had been brought into 
play; and the Chinese armed forces' ability to score a victory 
in the new war confrontation had been demonstrated. 
  These military exercises conducted by the mainland armed 
forces suggest that the possibility of armed attacks against 
Taiwan cannot be ruled out. Superficially, the two sides of the 
strait have conducted more exchanges than in the past, but their 
relations are fragile and will not withstand a test. It was 
hard to imagine that an incident in tourism had triggered an 
anticommunist sentiment on the entire Taiwan island and had also 
touched off clamors in the mainland military for armed 
occupation of Taiwan. If Deng Xiaoping cannot control the 
situation, will this irreconcilable ideological conflict be 
resolved by military action?

  [Text] Suzhou, 30 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Daohan, chairman 
ofthe Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
[ARATS], and Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the ARATS, 
inspected Taiwan-funded enterprises in Jiangsu Province from 24 
to 30 May, and during the same period they also saw students 
from Taiwan who are studying in Nanjing. 
  The development of Taiwan-funded enterprises in Jiangsu has 
been very rapid. In addition to labor intensive industries, 
Taiwanese businessmen have also made investments in high-tech 
enterprises, infrastructure projects, and tertiary industry in 
the province. Those Taiwan-funded enterprises which have been 
put into operation have gained good results. Chairman Wang 
Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei fully affirmed Jiangsu's 
work in improving the investment climate and in providing good 
services for Taiwan-funded enterprises. Chairman Wang Daohan 
said: Under the leadership of party committees and governments 
at various levels, Taiwan affairs offices at various levels in 
the province have made outstanding achievements in absorbing 
capital from Taiwan to serve Jiangsu's economic development. In 
1992 and 1993, Jiangsu topped the whole country in absorbing 
capital from Taiwan as compared with the total annual investment 
by Taiwanese businessmen in other provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions. In particular, Jiangsu has utilized 
Taiwan's capital to transform old enterprises and achieved very 
good results. 
  Accompanied by responsible comrades of the Taiwan Affairs 
Office of Jiangsu Province, the General Office of the Jiangsu 
Provincial CPC Committee, and party committees and governments 
of various prefectures and cities, Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice 
Chairman Tang Shubei inspected Taiwan-funded enterprises and 
economic and technological development zones in Nanjing, 
Yangzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou. They also held discussions with 
Taiwanese businessmen in Nanjing and Suzhou. Chairman Wang 
Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei attentively listened to 
reports by chairmen of the board and general managers of various 
Taiwan-funded enterprises. They expressed satisfaction with the 
production and operation of Taiwan-funded enterprises; and 
encouraged Taiwanese industrial and commercial people to closely 
cooperate with entrepreneurs in Jiangsu on a mutually beneficial 
basis, give full play to the advantages of both sides, and make 
greater development together. Chairman Wang Daohan asked 
authorities in Jiangsu to actively adopt measures to serious 
implement the "Law on the Protection of Investment of Taiwan 
Compatriots" promulgated by the National People's Congress and 
make further efforts to protect the lawful rights and interests 
of Taiwanese businessmen who have invested in Jiangsu. They 
hoped the authorities in Jiangsu would continue to improve the 
investment climate; strengthen consultative services for 
investment by Taiwanese businessmen; and create good conditions 
for the establishment, production, and operation of 
Taiwan-funded enterprises. 
  Wang Daohan fully affirmed the preparations for the 
establishment of associations for Taiwan-funded enterprises in 
Yangzhou and Nanjing cities. He hoped that other locales with 
large numbers of Taiwan-funded enterprises would also establish 
associations for Taiwan-funded enterprises as quickly as 
possible when conditions are ripe so they can act as bridges 
between Taiwan-funded enterprises and governments at various 
levels and serve Taiwanese businessmen in a better way. 
  During their stay in Nanjing, Chairman Wang and Vice 
Chairman 
Tang also met with a number of students from Taiwan who are 
studying at schools of higher learning there, and held cordial 
talks with them and listened to their opinions. Chairman Wang 
expressed his welcome to those students who have parted from 
their parents and come to study on the mainland. He warmly 
encouraged those students from Taiwan to study hard, welcomed 
more students from Taiwan to come and study on the mainland, and 
hoped the younger generation on both sides of the straits would 
strengthen exchanges. Chairman Wang asked concerned departments 
in Jiangsu Province to show good concern for students from 
Taiwan and help them solve their practical problems. 
  Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei, and their party arrived in Jiangsu 
on 24 May. On the afternoon of the same day, Chen Huanyou, 
secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee and governor 
of Jiangsu, met with Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang 
Shubei. Chen Huanyou expressed his appreciation of the ARATS's 
concern for and support to Jiangsu's Taiwan affairs work.

  [Text] Beijing [date not given] (WEN WEI PO)--A Hong Kong 
journal carried a news item not long ago, which was then 
reprinted by several newspapers here, saying that the CPC has 
decided to initiate a XIANGGANG TEQU BAO ["Hong Kong SAR 
Daily"], to be circulated in Hong Kong after 1997; in addition, 
it said that Beijing is selecting and transferring personnel to 
start preparatory work, while related departments in the 
hinterland are formulating decrees and regulations about Hong 
Kong media after 1997. For this reason, this reporter has 
visited related departments here, and learned that the 
aforementioned report was groundless and sheer fabrication.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong </F>
Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, by Peter Seidlitz in 
Beijing; date not given] 
  [Text] Q [Question]: What are the sticking points in the 
Hong Kong talks on the airport? 
  A [Answer]: You know the background. The problems started 
to arise when the British side could not manage the financial 
arrangements. The cost started to rise. The amount of loans 
was also far past the amount contained in the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU). The result was that the negotiation has 
carried on over how to resolve the issue of the financial 
arrangement. 
  Not long ago, the British side put forward the fourth 
proposal on the financial arrangement. But it's still quite 
different from the provisions of the MOU. 
  At the meeting held with the Airport Committee last month, 
we 
had already put forward our proposals regarding their fourth 
proposal. Now we are waiting for the answer from the British 
side towards our proposal. 
  I cannot be sure whether an agreement will be reached soon, 
but one thing I can say is that the positions on both sides are 
getting closer. Personally, I think the prospects are promising. 
  Q: Am I right to assume that your policy is to sit Governor 
Chris Patten out until 1997 and that no dialogue with him is 
possible? 
  A: We have many channels of communication between China and 
Britain. We can contact each other through London or in 
Beijing. The British Embassy can also contact the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 
  In Hong Kong, the political department of Xinhua and the 
Political Adviser's Office of the Hong Kong Government are also 
channels. The Joint Liaison Group can also maintain contact 
even if it's not during formal meetings. (Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs director) Lu Ping did not see Mr Patten because, even if 
they did meet, they would have nothing to talk about. 
  Q: I would think there is a lot to talk about. 
  A: No talk on substantial issues is possible with Mr Patten. 
  Q: Do you still have a grudge against the British because of 
their long colonial history? 
  A: We Chinese feel quite bitter that the British forced 
China to give up Hong Kong -- you must understand that. I am 
glad to see that finally we are going to take Hong Kong back and 
end the history of being humiliated. 
  However, history is history. We should bury the past. But 
there are still a few people in Britain now whose minds are in 
the 19th century. It is not good for some politicians or 
principal officers to think that they are still living in the 
last century. 
  Q: Would you deny that the British have done a good job here 
in Hong Kong in the last 100 years or do you view them as an 
imperialist power which used Hong Kong to enrich themselves and 
their companies? 
  A: It took all people to achieve this. So I don't have any 
comment right now if the British have done a good or bad job or 
if they have been successful or failed. We now have the 
historic mission to ensure the prosperity and stability of Hong 
Kong. 
  Q: There are fears that the efficiency and honesty of the 
administration will not be as good as now after 1997. 
  A: This issue has been raised for more than 10 years. I 
want to quote part of a speech by Mr Deng Xiaoping to reply to 
your question. Deng said one must trust that Hong Kong Chinese 
can manage Hong Kong. Those people who don't trust us have the 
minds of old colonialists. 
  We have the fullest confidence in Hong Kong Chinese who are 
able to run Hong Kong well. The prosperity achieved in Hong 
Kong is mainly due to the Chinese people of Hong Kong. Chinese 
people's capability is not lower than foreigners. We are not 
handicapped. Do not always think that only foreigners can do the 
job, Chinese can do them well too. 
  Q: The statistics show that 32 per cent of all directorate 
positions in the civil service are still occupied by foreigners, 
even though they account for less than two per cent of all civil 
servants. 
  A: According to the Basic Law, foreign officers will 
continue to keep their jobs after 1997. But the key positions, 
actually less than 30 (of them), are going to be localised. 
  Q: Do you intend to keep the Independent Commission Against 
Corruption [ICAC] and establish your own Special Branch now that 
the British are closing theirs and taking the files to London? 
  A: According to the Basic Law, the ICAC will stay. As for 
organisations like Special Branch, that will be decided by the 
government in future. In my own opinion, as long as the current 
organisations are effective they will be maintained. But 
organisations like Special Branch will have to be maintained 
well. 
  Q: We all know that Xinhua is more than a news agency. What 
will be the role of Xinhua after 1997? 
  A: We haven't studied this question yet. According to the 
Basic Law after 1997, the central Government will establish a 
foreign affairs office in Hong Kong. 
  Q: Will diplomats based in Hong Kong have to report and be 
accredited to this office or the Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) government? 
  A: I believe that, until 1996 or 1997, we will (not) have a 
clear answer for you regarding this issue. One thing for sure 
is that, in future, the Special Administrative Region will be 
administrated under its own government. But institutions 
established by the Beijing Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be 
responsible for the foreign affairs managed by central 
government. All issues of foreign affairs in Hong Kong will be 
unified and dealt with under the management of the central 
Government in Beijing. 
  Q: Hong Kong-based diplomats I talked to this week seem 
unclear about the exact status of their offices after 1997 and 
if ambassadors in Beijing will be ultimately responsible for 
their offices here. 
  A: Not necessarily. According to the agreements, the 
Foreign Office to be established in Hong Kong will be in charge 
of the major affairs in Hong Kong, but they still can empower 
the Hong Kong Government to manage certain aspects. 
  Q: What kind of loyalty are you expecting from the 
expatriates in the civil service? 
  A: All government servants should be dedicated to their 
duties and are responsible to the Government. For expatriate 
civil servants, regulations are in place already for post-1997. 
They say that the Hong Kong Government can employ Hong Kong 
officers, British or any other foreign nationals. However, at a 
certain level these officer positions must be held by permanent 
residents and Chinese citizens of HKSAR who do not have other 
countries' residency. 
  They are: the secretaries and deputy secretaries, directors 
of bureaus, directors of organisations such as ICAC, director of 
audit, chief of police, etc. The Hong Kong Government can also 
employ British citizens or other foreign citizens as advisers. 
  Q: The provisions are clear. But less clear seems to be who 
actually holds what passport. You must be aware that many Hong 
Kong people have two passports, even those who are on the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). What is your position on 
these dual passport holders? Are you going to demand that they 
give up their foreign passport? 
  A: For the members of the PWC, we don't have requirements on 
nationality. Hong Kong is a special place, and the Chinese 
Government will work out some special conditions. For example, 
the Regulation Committee will allow 20 per cent of Legco 
[Legislative Council] members to have a non-Hong Kong passport. 
You must admit that is quite unique in the world. So it shows 
we are aware of the realities in Hong Kong. But the executive 
officers or committee chiefs or the remaining 80 per cent of 
officers must be Chinese citizens. 
  Q: What is your policy towards the huge Filipino maid 
community in Hong Kong, since you could be tempted to slow down 
immigration from Manila and follow a policy of using cheap 
female labour from across the border in China? 
  A: It is up to the Hong Kong Government to decide what to do 
with the huge Philippine and Thai maid community. 
  One thing I am sure of is that the labour problems in China 
will not be solved through exporting them into the Hong Kong 
market. Hong Kong is such a small place with only 1,100 square 
kilometres, but it has a six million population. It cannot 
reduce the huge labour problems of China. 
  Q: There are a lot of Chinese corporations in Hong Kong. 
Are you keeping a critical eye on the activities of the Chinese 
companies which, after all, are state-owned and partly 
responsible for the speculation in the property market, which is 
alarming. 
  A: Chinese companies only occupy a small percentage of the 
huge Hong Kong market. We estimate it to be only seven per cent 
to eight per cent. But they have quite an influence on the Hong 
Kong market. 
  They have contributed a lot to Hong Kong's prosperity. Some 
of the big companies provide less expensive products to the Hong 
Kong market. The Chinese banking groups are now No 2 in the 
industry. We have investigated the activities of the companies 
and found that, as far as property speculation is concerned, 
their part is not so great. 
  Q: Will Xinhua's Hong Kong director Zhou Nan outstay Mr 
Patten? 
  A: The local press has had a lot of speculation about Mr 
Zhou and even me being transferred or recalled. As you see, we 
are still here and have outstayed all the rumours.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Legislators yesterday gave the go-ahead for a 
funding request of $715 million to finance the installation of 
the airport railway immersed tube and related projects amid 
signs of optimism for a Sino-British agreement. The approved 
funding was $102 million less than the original request tabled 
in the Legislative Council last month due to lower tender prices 
submitted to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). It 
represents about three percent of an equity injection of $23.7 
billion for the airport railway contained in the fourth 
financing package given to the Chinese side in February. 
  The Financial Secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, also confirmed 
a 
report that the latest proposal on equity injection to the 
Provisional Airport Authority stood at $36.6 billion. The two 
amounted to a total equity injection of $60.3 billion by the 
Government -- $40 billion more than that in the first proposal. 
Sir Hamish said he did not think the revelation of the figures 
would affect the Sino-British talks. "I think they will 
understand that just to review the equity is reasonable," he 
said. 
  Sir Hamish said there was a need to reassure legislators on 
whether the funding request tabled to them would be in line with 
the amount of equity. He refused to say whether the revelation 
meant that the gap between the two governments had become 
narrower. "At different stages in the talks, as work 
progresses, then we have to gradually reveal more in order to 
give members enough of the picture for them to feel that they 
can make a reasonable judgment and approve the funds," he said. 
  Last week, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, Lu Ping, said he expected an agreement on the airport in 
about two months. 
  The money, granted as advanced funding, will become part of 
the equity injection to the MTRC [Mass Transit Railway 
Corporation]. The MTRC confirmed that British firm Tarmac 
International and Japan's Kumagai Gumi had jointly been awarded 
the project. 
  Due to earlier delays, it was estimated that the airport 
railway section linking Central to Kowloon would be completed 
only in April 1998. 
  According to the latest submission, the estimated cost of 
the 
airport railway immersed tube and related works has dropped from 
$726 million to $630 million. The construction supervision and 
resident site staff allowance also dropped by $7 million to $51 
million. The reduction in the prices listed has resulted in a 
lower project contingency level at $34 million. 
  Meanwhile, Sir Hamish's confirmation of the equity amount 
also sparked criticisms that the Government was "governing 
through the media." Three leading parties the United Democrats, 
the Liberal Party, and Meeting Point -- also questioned the 
Government for rejecting their request for details of the fourth 
financing proposal, information of which has been leaked to the 
press. The Liberal Party's Steven Poon Kwok-lim said: "As 
legislators, we are not happy with it. Are you governing 
through the media?" 
  Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang dismissed the 
suggestion. "We do not feed information to the press. We do not 
have complete control on what the press may or may not say," she 
said.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Three large Hong 
Kong-based conglomerates have contracted the project of 
renovating a part of the old downtown area and some traditional 
industries in this capital of central China's Hubei Province. 
  The three big names are New World Development Co. Ltd, Sun 
Hung Kai and Co. Ltd and Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd. 
  The project is estimated to cost each of them at least five 
billion yuan. 
  Wuhan, a city with rapid economic development, has become a 
hot spot for overseas investors since the central government 
stressed the opening strategy along the Chang Jiang River. 
  The New World Group has injected more than two billion yuan 
into the city in the past two years. 
  The other two companies have also invested in the country's 
pioneer cities in the reform drive, such as Beijing, Shenzhen 
and Guangzhou.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Councillor 
Chen Junsheng urged localities this Tuesday [31 May] to make 
effective use of their land resources in light of dwindling 
arable land and steady population growth. 
  In a national conference on comprehensive agricultural 
development, Chen stressed the importance of agriculture in 
coastal provinces. 
  He warned officials from the coastal areas, "the 
consequences 
would be dangerous if the secondary and service industries are 
developed at the sacrifice of agriculture." 
  A task of key importance for China is to adopt measures to 
make optimal use of land resources so as to ensure the steady 
and sustainable supply of farm products, he said. 
  To do so, he said, local governments should intensify their 
efforts in improving the country's 57 million hectares of 
low-yield farmland which is a potential food basket. 
  According to Chen, China has already improved nearly 10 
million hectares of low-yield land and reclaimed another 1.1 
million hectares of waste land in the five years from 1988 to 
1993. 
  The key to further efforts in this respect lies in the 
construction of irrigation projects, extension of fine seeds and 
development of new cultivating techniques, he said. 
  Chen also urged local governments to fortify sandy land to 
make it productive. He told the officials present that China 
has about 67 million hectares of sandy wasteland. "It would 
produce considerable social and ecological benefits if we could 
develop just ten percent of this land in ten years," he said. 
  Meanwhile, he called on local governments to develop tidal 
zones and reclaim land by enclosing sea beaches. Chen said 
China's coastal provinces have a total of 1.3 million hectares 
of tidal flats which can be reclaimed. "Economic results would 
be enormous if we could turn half of this area into arable 
land," the state councillor added. 
  In the conference, Chen lauded the efforts by Liaoning, a 
major industrial province in China's northeast, to provide ample 
food for its people. 
  According to the state councillor, Liaoning used to rely on 
other provinces for supplies of grain and major foodstuffs. 
However, the province doesn't have to transport grain from 
other provinces anymore as it has boosted its grain output to 15 
billion kg since 1990. 
  The province now boasts of surplus supplies in domestic 
poultry, eggs, milk, meat and vegetables. "Liaoning Province has 
set us an example to attain coordinated development in the 
first, second and third industries for other coastal areas," he 
said.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen 
Junsheng recently said emphatically: In economically developed 
coastal provinces, agricultural development does not conflict 
with the development of secondary and tertiary industries, and 
agricultural development and industrial development are not 
interchangeable. Those who think the development of secondary 
and tertiary industries will eventually affect agricultural 
development are wrong. He added: As long as cadres at all 
levels earnestly take the overall interests into consideration, 
they will be able to promote and develop primary, secondary, and 
tertiary industries simultaneously. If they develop secondary 
and tertiary industries at the expense of agriculture, the 
consequences will be perilous. 
  The State Council held a joint conference on comprehensive 
agricultural development in Beijing on 31 May. Leaders from 
departments concerned of the CPC Central Committee exchanged 
views on the arrangements for such comprehensive agricultural 
development projects as the Liao He Small Delta development 
project. Chen Junsheng pointed out at the meeting: We are 
faced with a very important task -- under the situation in which 
the population continues to grow and farmland shrinks with each 
passing year, how can we take effective measures to utilize and 
develop farmland resources to the maximum, ensure a long-term 
and stable supply of agricultural produce, and pay attention to 
family planning and control of illegal use of farmland at the 
same time? 
  Chen Junsheng urged localities to do a good job in the 
following aspects while developing and utilizing land resources: 
  First, we need to further transform medium- and low-yield 
farmland and quicken the pace of rationally cultivating 
wasteland. He said: From 1988 to 1993, 145 million mu of 
medium- and low-yield farmland has been transformed, and 17.25 
million mu of wasteland has been cultivated across the country. 
These two projects helped increase 1.915 billion kg of grains, 
a increase of 105 kg per mu. It is a great achievement. At 
present, 855 million mu of medium- and low-yield farmland 
nationwide has not yet been transformed, indicating great 
potential in the increase of grain production. The key to 
achieving the task lies in irrigation construction, 
popularization of improved varieties of grains, and development 
of new cultivation techniques. From now on, we should further 
arouse the enthusiasm of all sides and intensify efforts in 
cultivating wasteland. In this field, we must persist in paying 
equal attention to economic, social, and ecological efficiency. 
  Second, we must turn the desert into an oasis. China now has 
1 billion mu of usable sandy wasteland. If we spend 10 years 
developing 100 million mu of sandy wasteland, we will get 
incalculable social and ecological benefits. He said: China 
has accumulated plenty of successful experiences in desert 
control and we should popularize these experiences in various 
localities in line with local conditions. 
  Third, we should develop coastal shoals and reclaim land 
from 
marshes. Chen Junsheng said: There is nearly 20 million mu of 
shoals along China's coastal provinces that are suitable for 
cultivation. If we can turn 10 million mu of these shoals into 
farmland in 10 years, we will gain huge profits. 
  Chen Junsheng spoke highly of Liaoning's measures to promote 
comprehensive agricultural development in recent years and its 
achievement of being more than sufficient in agricultural 
produce. Liaoning, China's base of heavy industries and raw 
materials, had been short of grain and major nonstaple food for 
a long time. Since 1988, Liaoning has made efforts in 
comprehensive agricultural development and has significantly 
increased grain production. Since 1990, total grain production 
in Liaoning has reached 1.5 billion kg, enough for the entire 
province. Since then, Liaoning has not needed to import grain 
from other regions. Currently, Liaoning has a sufficient supply 
of nonstaple food like poultry, eggs, milk, pork, and 
vegetables. Chen Junsheng pointed out: Liaoning offers a good 
example to other coastal provinces in coordinately developing 
primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.

  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- To further improve the 
overall coordination of economic performance, the State Economic 
and Trade Commission recently held in Beijing the first meeting 
on the overall coordination of economic performance. The 
meeting was attended by officials in charge of concerned 
departments. 
  Comrades attending the meeting were of the opinion that, 
under socialist market economic conditions, it had become 
increasingly important to adopt new methods in line with market 
economic work to guide economic performance. They said: 
Currently, we should improve the overall coordination of 
economic performance in accordance with the new characteristics 
of the market economy, stressing "overall" and "coordination." 
We should ensure that the economy develops in a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy manner by exercising regulation and control 
over economic performance in a timely fashion. 
  The primary purpose of the meeting was to study how to 
establish a system for holding meetings on the overall 
coordination of economic performance. The meeting also 
seriously analyzed current economic performance and studied ways 
to further improve the overall coordination of economic 
performance, to coordinate relevant policies, and to implement 
relevant measures. 
  While analyzing the current economic situation, especially 
the situation of state-owned enterprises, Wang Zhongyu, minister 
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said: 
First of all, over the last few years the state has adopted 
many policies and mesaures aimed at state-owned enterprises, and 
party committees and governments at all levels and enterprises 
themselves have done a great deal of work; as a result, 
state-owned enterprises' conditions have improved. State-owned 
enterprises have made and will continue to make great 
contributions to the country's reform and development. Second, 
we should pay great attention to and strive to solve 
difficulties and problems related to some enterprises' 
production and management. Some specific requirements and time 
are needed to solve these problems. Third, state-owned 
enterprises have vitality; we are full of confidence in 
improving their performance. During the first quarter of this 
year, some new developments occurred in state-owned enterprises. 
By conducting a pragmatic analysis, we can find that 
state-owned enterprises have improved in some way and have 
developed in the right direction. Because of this, state-owned 
enterprises over the last few years have been able to cope with 
various negative effects (including adjustments in coal, 
electricity, oil, and transportation prices) and have provided 
the state with a large amount of wealth. As the measures to 
reform the financial, taxation, and foreign exchange systems are 
being carried out, the new systems have basically functioned 
normally. During a period of time to come, we should make 
special efforts to improve work related to state-owned 
enterprises. We should make further efforts to transform 
enterprises' operating mechanisms and to establish a new 
enterprise system. We also should do a good job in 
experimenting with the enterprise bankruptcy system, clearing up 
enterprises' debts, increasing enterprises' own funds, limiting 
enterprises' production and reducing their stocks, improving 
enterprises' profitability, and improving enterprise management 
to raise work related to state-owned enterprises to a new level. 
  Those attending the meeting included officials in charge of 
the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Ministry of Coal 
Industry, Ministry of Electronics Industry, Ministry of 
Machine-Building Industry, Ministry of Chemical Industry, 
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Railways, 
Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Internal Trade, Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the China National 
Textile Council, the China National Light Industry Council, the 
State Administration of Taxation, and the State Statistics 
Bureau.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "Trademark Infringers Shut Down"] </F>
  [Text] A number of illegal producers and retailers have 
been closed down in Guangdong Province for infringing on the 
property rights of Lucozade, a British beverage trademark, 
according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
(SAIC). 
  The local administrations for industry and commerce in 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhanjiang cities started the 
investigation immediately after Beecham Group PLC [public 
limited company], the British holder of the trademark, handed in 
its complaint about the infringement. 
  The infringers were promptly ferreted out in early April, 
with 947 boxes of bottled beverages, 600,000 bottle tops, 52,000 
packages and 58,000 empty bottles seized, according to a report 
issued by the SAIC last week. 
  This is the latest case handled in Guangdong, a province 
which has won praise from foreign businessmen for protecting 
their registered trademarks in China. 
  In the capital city of Guangzhou alone, more than 900 
foreign 
trademark violation cases have been investigated and dealt with 
in the past decade, which made up 15 percent of the total 
trademark infringement cases in the city. 
  Most of the cases handled in Guangzhou concerned trademarks 
from Hong Kong, Japan, Italy and the United States such as the 
trademarks for Goldlion, Sharp, Sony, Diadora, Levis and Mobil. 
  China stands firm on the protection of the exclusive rights 
of the trademarks registered by foreign businesses in China, 
said a trademark administration official with SAIC, 
  The number of trademark infringement and counterfeiting 
cases 
handled by the Chinese administrative authorities for industry 
and commerce reached 13,042 last year out of which about 500 
cases involved foreign trademarks, as disclosed by SAIC 
statistics. 
  The State's vigilant efforts continue, although the number 
of 
trademark violation cases handled so far this year is 
unavailable, said the official. 
  To ensure rigorous protection, China has so far promulgated 
the Trademark Law, the Patent Law the Copyright Law, and, the 
Law Against Unethical Competition, among other laws and 
regulations, all of which provide a legal guarantee for the 
protection of intellectual property lights. 
  There has been a rapid increase in trademark applications 
filed in China by foreign manufacturers and traders. The number 
of registered trademarks amounted to 59,466 by the end of last 
year, which was 10 times that of 1979.

  [Text] Nanning, 21 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)-- The Xinan 
Appraisal Center -- China's largest appraisal institution on the 
quality system of export-manufacturing enterprises (IS09000) -- 
yesterday opened for business in Nanning, marking the first step 
of a joint effort by the six southwest provinces and cities of 
Sichuan, Chongqing City, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Tibet to 
bring their practices in line with international conventions. 
  Experts at yesterday's inaugural convention of the Xinan 
Appraisal Center said that cooperation between economically 
advanced areas in southwest China has resulted in considerable 
economic growth. The region now boosts thousands of exporting 
enterprises which are getting increasing numbers of overseas 
production orders. Given the situation, the six southwest 
provinces and regions joined hands in establishing the Xinan 
Appraisal Center on the quality system of export-manufacturing 
enterprises to push for the IS09000-series international 
standard, which will link the region with the 50 countries that 
adopt this standard. 
  Experts claim that the center is the largest appraisal 
center 
covering the widest geographic area among the 20 so far 
registered in China. It will effectively promote the quality 
management of exporting enterprises in the southwest region and 
increase the competitiveness of their products.

  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- A textile street will be 
built in eastern Beijing in the coming years. 
  The street will be built at the sites of Guanghua Street and 
Chaoyang Street in the Chaoyang District of the city. At 
present, ten large textile enterprises, with total fixed assets 
of 900 million yuan and 35,000 workers, and covering an area of 
two million sq m [square miles], are located in the area. 
  According to the city's new programs, the workshops of these 
enterprises will be moved out to the suburbs or to materials 
production areas, while this area will be developed into textile 
and clothing research and information centers, trading centers 
and commercial apartment buildings. 
  The city plans to build two million sq m in residential 
space 
in the area by 2000, which will bring much more profit than the 
sluggish textile enterprises. 
  Meanwhile, all textile production facilities will be moved 
out of the downtown area by 2000. On the sites, stores, hotels 
and trading centers will be built. 
  Experts predict that the annual sales volume of Beijing's 
textile industry will reach 10 billion yuan by 2000, 1.5 times 
that of the present.

Editorial Department"] 
  [Text] Wang Yuzhao, member of the Standing 
Committee, and vice chairman of the Economy Committee, of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference: "Sobering Signs of Danger." 
  The agricultural problem has already drawn the attention of 
society as a whole. The party Central Committee and the State 
Council have called two meetings on rural work within a short 
time. Add to this the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC 
Central Committee, which was held before the 14th National 
Congress of the CPC and was devoted specifically to the study of 
agriculture and rural Problems, and we have the issue being 
raised three times. This indicates that the Party Central 
Committee and the State Council are very concerned about the 
problems in agriculture and rural China. 
  In recent years, with the development of a market economy, 
some new situations and new problems have occurred in rural 
work. Some call these contradictions at a deeper level; others 
call them crises. I believe that, at the current stage, many 
significant signs of danger have indeed appeared in the 
countryside. If handled properly, the problems can be resolved. 
If not solved in a timely fashion, then problems may occur 
which have serious consequences. 
  Since the rural reform was implemented after the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, the 
development trend of China's agriculture has been very good. 
Farm products have increased on a large scale; farmers' income 
has risen substantially; township and town enterprises have 
sprung up as a new force; and the construction of small rural 
towns has also seen substantial development. Despite a few 
years of stagnation, the development trend, on the whole, has 
been good. Production development brought on by rural reform 
has enabled us to stockpile over 300 billion jin of grain and a 
large quantity of cotton reserves. The increase in output of 
various agricultural products has provided ample raw material 
for the development of textile and other light industries, and 
township and town enterprises have created an output value of 
2.9 trillion yuan. Both rural work and rural production have 
seen great achievements. However, some new contradictions and 
new problems, or signs of danger, which have been exposed in 
recent years should draw our attention. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
said long ago that the 1990's will either see no problems, or, 
if there are problems, they will be in agriculture. What, then, 
are the main problems faced by agriculture? 
  First, the most important manifestation is a drop in 
the production enthusiasm of farmers, especially the enthusiasm 
for farming. When the contract responsibility system on a 
household basis with remuneration linked to output was first 
implemented, farmer enthusiasm was very high, and the 
agricultural productive forces, held back for many years, were 
suddenly released. Hence the great achievement that was 
obtained. The drop in farmer enthusiasm in recent years cannot 
but catch our attention and alert us. The most active element 
in the rural productive forces is the farmer. If the farmers are 
not enthusiastic, how can agriculture move forward? 
  Why then has farmer enthusiasm dropped? There are basically 
two reasons. The first is the slow increase in farmer income. 
During the two years of 1988 and 1989, farmer income saw 
negative growth; in 1990 and 1991 there was some increase; and 
during the recent two years it has again increased, albeit at 
the slow speed of 2 percent. The fall in farmer income has 
affected the material interests of the farmers, the urban/rural 
income gap has widened, and farmers have felt it very unfair. 
The second is the substantial reduction in farmland. This 
includes two factors: One is that development zones have 
occupied large plots of land, and the other is that, because the 
comparative benefits of farming have fallen, farmers have been 
unwilling to till the land and leave some land uncultivated, 
making China's traditional contradiction between a large 
population and the shortage of land even more acute. 
  Second, the decrease or slow increase in agricultural 
output. Although last year grain output exceeded the 900 
billion jin mark, many have expressed doubts about this because 
the cultivated area dropped last year, sales of chemical 
fertilizer were down, and grain prices went up. Therefore, 
although one can say that grain output broke a historical 
record, whether farm products can steadily increase still 
remains a very worrisome problem in the national economy. The 
output of cotton was over 47 million dan, while demand was 80 to 
90 million dan. In addition, the output of sugar-bearing crops 
dropped, and oil-bearing crops were also in short supply. 
Another phenomenon worth noting is that, in the past, grain from 
the south was shipped north, but now grain from the north is 
being shipped south. Guangdong may purchase over 10 billion jin 
of grain this year (for human consumption, animal feed, and 
industrial use) this year. 
  Third, the reduction of agricultural input. 
According to statistics provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
at its highest point China's agricultural basic construction 
input occupied 10.3 percent of national basic construction 
investment (1978). Since rural reform, the investment scale for 
agriculture has been continuously depressed. During 1987 and 
1988 it slowed to 3.3 percent, and, while 1989 saw a slight 
increase to over 4 percent, last year it dropped again to 2.2 
percent. The government's input in agriculture has not been 
reduced; it is mainly that local input has been reduced. If the 
relevant departments continue to neglect this issue, the input 
in agriculture may continue to drop. Agriculture is also an 
industry, and without input there will be no output. 
  Fourth, the gap between industry and agriculture has 
widened; the income gap between urban and rural residents has 
exacerbated; and the gaps between the eastern and coastal 
regions and the central and western regions have expanded. 
It should be pointed out that uneven development in urban and 
rural areas and in the eastern and western parts of the country 
is normal. Only through the relatively faster development of 
the east can the comprehensive development of the entire country 
be brought about. However, a disproportionate development of 
industry and agriculture will inevitably affect the entire 
national economy. Without developing agriculture, the whole 
economy cannot develop in a healthy manner. History has already 
given us good experience in this area. Now the disparity 
between the development of industry and agriculture has advanced 
to the brink of danger. If we continue to avoid adjusting it, 
and if agriculture continues to be denied real support, the 
entire national economy will be unable to bear the burden. 
  The gap between agriculture and industry has expanded. Last 
year, urban per capita income grew 10.3 percent, while in the 
countryside it only grew 3.3 percent. The income growth ratio 
between urban and rural residents is 2.8 to 1. The ratio before 
reform was 2.4 to 1, but, some time after reform, it was reduced 
to 1.7 to 1. Now the gap between urban and rural areas has 
expanded again, and farmers feel it is very unfair. Recently, a 
Shanxi farmer wrote a letter to say that 2 jin of rice can only 
trade for 1 Hongtashan cigarette and 2 jin of wheat trade for 1 
jin of chemical fertilizer. The scissor gap between prices of 
industrial goods agricultural products is becoming larger and 
larger. 
  Fifth, the yearly expanding migrant labor tide reflects 
that the employment situation for rural surplus labor has 
already become very acute. In recent years the tidal wave 
of migrant laborers has risen ever higher. According to 
estimates, China's rural surplus labor force has already reached 
130 million people. Several dozen million people traveling 
outside their provinces have a major impact upon society. This 
is the result of the rural employment problem. After liberation, 
China practiced a residence registration management system which 
tied farmers firmly to the land. Farmers had no freedom to go 
out to seek a living. Now there is a surplus labor force, and 
in many places it is "one month for the Lunar New Year Festival, 
three months for farming, and eight months with nothing to do." 
Since reform and opening up, especially under the onslaught of 
the market economy, those farmers who cannot find any occupation 
in their localities leave their home and land for the big cities 
and open coastal regions. Since 1989, the scale of migrant 
laborers has increased annually, and by last year the 
transprovincial migrant population exceeded 20 million. 
  A few years ago this problem was still neglected and people 
had an incorrect understanding of the phenomenon. Some people 
tended to view migrant laborers as "aimless vagrants" and wanted 
to block them or even to use an iron broom to sweep them from 
the cities. Today the situation is better. Prime Minister Li 
Peng has cleared the name of migrant laborers in his report to 
this year's National People's Congress, pointing out that the 
movement of farmers is the flow of history and an unavoidable 
trend of economic development. The migrant labor problem has 
begun to draw attention from various quarters, and the people's 
understanding of this issue is becoming unified. 
  Sixth, the contingent of agricultural science and 
technology workers is shaky and unstable. It should be 
pointed out that scientific and technological progress and 
popularization have played an important role in China's 
agricultural development. According to estimates, the role of 
the science and technology factor in agricultural growth has 
been approximately 40 percent. During the past two years, 
however, due to the impact of the market economy and the trend 
of increasing earnings, the contingent of rural science and 
technology personnel has become unstable. Many people have 
entered the business world to earn money, and some technicians 
have switched to other fields. This, too, is a danger sign for 
agricultural production. 
  I have listed the danger signs above. On the whole, the most 
serious problem is the drop in productive enthusiasm among the 
farmers. Next is the migrant laborer problem. If this problem 
is not solved properly, the rural surplus labor force will not 
be able to find an outlet, the countryside will not be able to 
realize a relatively well-off standard of living, and 
modernization will not come about in China. 
  That the aforementioned problems have developed to such an 
extent today is perhaps related to our failure to catch up with 
the study of agricultural policies. The forces studying 
agricultural policies are currently scattered. We should 
concentrate our forces in studying the new problems and new 
situations occurring in rural work. Many new phenomena and new 
problems have appeared in the countryside, and these all require 
that us to do in-depth studies and sum them up in a timely 
fashion. 
  Danger signs have already appeared in agriculture. 
Fortunately, the party Central Committee and the State Council 
are already paying attention to and taking measures to solve 
these problems. Within a period of less than six months, two 
meetings on rural work have been called and some policy measures 
have been adopted. The key issue right now is implementation 
and execution. One should say that the policy measures adopted 
by the central government are good, but that execution and 
implementation measures are weak. So, for example, in the end 
how much diesel oil for farm use or chemical fertilizer should 
be supplied at fixed state prices? The central government's 
determination is great, but the execution at the actual 
grass-roots level will always be watered down. At present, I 
think the most worrisome problem is that the central policy 
measures cannot be implemented. This is the greatest problem. 
  One of the key reasons why the central government's policy 
and measures cannot be implemented is structural. The central 
authorities have held several good meetings, but after the 
meetings there needs to be a forceful authoritative organ which 
can take charge of coordination and ensure implementation. All 
the decisions made in the previous meetings on rural work have 
been very good and very valuable. If they had all been actually 
implemented, China's agriculture would not have gone wrong. The 
current situation, in which each department does as it likes 
according to its own interests, should on no account be allowed 
to continue. 
  Chen Xiwen, director of the Rural Development 
Research Department of the State Council Development Research 
Center: "The Central Government's Polities and Measures Are 
Good, But It Is Difficult To Implement Them at the Local and 
Departmental Levels" 
  The importance of agriculture and the need to pay attention 
to the farmers' problems have been elaborated many times during 
recent years in the speeches of leading comrades, in newspapers 
and periodicals, and in documents. But many agricultural and 
rural problems remain, and people are still not assured about 
the future of agriculture. Where lies the problem? 
  Investigation and study have not been conducted 
sufficiently or thoroughly; the basic situation of agriculture 
and farmers is unclear; and there has been a delayed reaction to 
major rural problems. Currently, one outstanding problem 
is that some leading organizations tend to react rather slowly 
in dealing with major rural problems. For example, although the 
problem of the farmers' burden has been talked about a great 
deal and much attention has been paid to it, many places still 
restrict their focus to increasing or decreasing farm products 
when judging the agricultural situation. Therefore, these 
people feel the situation is not bad, based on the increase in 
the supply of farm products in 1989, 1990, and 1991. Thus, they 
have actually neglected a series of serious problems brought 
about by the slowdown in the farmers' income growth or the 
reduction of income. This situation has caught the attention of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council. Actually, 
the burden problem is the other side of the income problem. If 
income rises rapidly, then a slight burden is no big deal. The 
main problem is that income has been rising slowly for three or 
four years in a row, and thus the burden seems particularly 
acute. 
  For example, the increase in farmer income recovered a bit 
in 
1992 and reached 5.9 percent. This, perhaps, caused some 
leading departments to lower their guard, thinking that the 
problem had been solved. Actually they did not see that, in 
1992, the economy developed rapidly due to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's speeches during his southern trip, especially in the 
southeastern coastal regions, and that there was a great deal of 
rapid growth in township and town enterprises. The 5.9 percent 
increase of 1992 actually covered up a great income discrepancy 
among farmers of different regions. I did some analysis of 
farmer income in 1991 and 1992. In more than half the provinces 
and municipalities, farmer income dropped. Even though 1991 saw 
a 2 percent growth, 1992 saw a 5.9 percent growth, and the 
national average was rising, in reality farmer income in more 
than half the provinces and municipalities was dropping. Seen 
from the perspective of the entire country, the problem of 
adequate food and clothing has been solved. After basically 
solving this problem, however, the supply of farm products is 
still an important problem. 
  On the whole, in evaluating the situation of the entire 
countryside, the index carrying the greatest overall weight 
should be farmer income. If farmer income does not increase, 
then the product increases you want cannot, in reality, be 
realized continuously. The situation in recent years reflects 
this. As Comrade Wang Yuzhao said just now, the lack of 
in-depth investigation and study causes the response to these 
major rural problems to be delayed. 
  Meetings are held, documents are issued, and 
understandings reach the higher levels, but if you want people 
to make real sacrifices, nobody will. The problem of "slogan 
agriculture" is far from being resolved. 
  A very important problem now is that rural policies cannot 
be 
implemented. According to my information, the rural work 
conference held in October last year issued a document covering 
a dozen or so concrete policies, the majority of which have not 
been implemented. For example, central document no. 11 issued in 
1993 says that the banking system should issue an additional 
22.5 billion yuan in loans for agriculture. By the time of the 
rural work conference this year, when we were again drafting a 
document, we saw people from the Agricultural Bank and asked 
about that 22.5 billion yuan. The reply was: The notice they 
received was that the entire 22.5 billion yuan was only the 
scale of credit, not the actual funds, so no money had been 
issued. There are many similar stories. I remember that funds 
were very tight last year. The document sent to central leaders 
for discussion had brackets after each policy, listing how much 
money was to be involved in each project. All the various 
department heads discussed it and acknowledged their 
responsibilities. Then the brackets were taken out, because 
listing concrete amounts of money in a central government 
document looked too trivial. The result was that, after the 
document was issued, not a penny materialized. 
  Another problem with agriculture is that, after the grain 
price fluctuations of last year, the party Central Committee and 
the State Council were very concerned and made a whole series of 
arrangements and held a series of meetings on stabilizing grain 
prices and on the shopping basket project. The purpose was to 
solve the effective supply problem. An outstanding problem in 
solving the effective supply problem is to keep an ample supply 
of means of production. However, looking at the current supply 
of means of production, the problem is still very acute. If 
this problem is not solved, then I think it will be very 
difficult for agriculture to recover and develop this year. 
  According to the fertilizer supply situation of previous 
years, each year we have to import 5 or 6 million tonnes of 
chemical fertilizer before the year's end, when the current 
year's use of fertilizer is finished, to prepare for the spring 
plowing. Last year there was a shortage of over 2 million 
tonnes. So, during this spring plowing, when the spring wheat 
is sown, there will be no chemical fertilizer, and we may have 
to sow seeds by themselves. Another problem is that, due to the 
impending readjustment in this year's foreign currency exchange 
and oil prices, all departments were watching and would not make 
a move. It was not until February that the Planning Commission 
delegated quotas for the import of chemical fertilizers and 
called for the signing of contracts during the first half of the 
year for the importation of 6.2 million tonnes of chemical 
fertilizer. So I went to inquire. By March 31, order forms had 
only been filled for 322,000 tonnes, equivalent to 5 percent of 
the quota. Judging from the current situation of the order, 
only 122,000 tonnes of imported fertilizer will arrive before 
April 30. Up to now the first half year's imported fertilizer 
is still unaccounted for. In mid-February the State Council 
issued an emergency telegram asking local governments to 
organize chemical fertilizers. But when it comes to execution, 
it ends up like this. 
  What is the reason for this? The Agricultural Materials 
Company says one of the major problems they encounter is the 
shortage of supplies. Compared with the same period last year, 
the first quarter lacks over 6 million tonnes of fertilizer. 
The chemical fertilizer for the spring plowing in northeastern 
China actually has no guarantees. Now we are solving the spring 
plowing problem for the south, and there are still no 
guarantees. First, supplies are extremely rare, and, second, we 
must deal with the prices of the means of production. There is 
no way to manage, and nobody has come up with a good method. 
  Let us take the price of urea, a chemical fertilizer, for 
example. We will only talk about the prices allowed and fixed 
by the state. Before October 1, 1992 it was 538 yuan/tonne. 
The price adjustment of October 1, 1992 was approved by the 
State Council, adjusting it to 660 yuan/tonne. By March 1993, 
only 5 months later, again with the approval of the State 
Council, the hidden subsidy was changed to an open subsidy and 
volumes were kept the same, while prices were liberalized. The 
factory price permitted by the State Council was 1000 
yuan/tonne, and the highest retail price was 1200 yuan/tonne. 
Thus, before October 1, 1992 the price was only 538 yuan/tonne, 
while prices after March 1993 were 1200 yuan/tonne. In less 
than a year and a half, the price had more than doubled. What 
compensation has been given to the farmers? 
  On March 23, a national conference of managers from means of 
production companies was held. The factory price of major 
chemical fertilizers by then had actually reached 1100-1150 
yuan/ton, representing another rise of 100-150 yuan. The 
price-limiting measure had not been canceled but prices had, in 
fact, gone up again. 
  These problems have all been emphasized, everyone claims to 
be very concerned, and many documents have been issued. But 
when it comes to the execution of concrete guidelines, then 
there is no well-thought plan as to how to execute them, who is 
responsible, or how to solve problems. For example, with 
chemical fertilizer in very short supply and its price soaring 
this year, the means of production companies also find 
themselves in a difficult position. Should they buy or shouldn't 
they, and, if they import at such high prices, wouldn't the 
farmers curse them? It is not clear who is ultimately 
responsible for problems like this or who one should go to when 
problems arise. These are rather major problems, and more 
concrete problems are innumerable. It boils down to "slogan 
agriculture." When you really want people to make sacrifices, 
nobody will. 
  The supply of agricultural products is the farmers' 
responsibility, and the prices of agricultural products are the 
farmers' responsibility. Just how much can the farmers bear? 
It is only fair to have the "three parties share it." 
  I believe that, under the present situation, when the rural 
economy is facing so many difficulties, we must persist in the 
goal of reform. This is also an important issue worthy of note 
and serious study. When supplies are short, should we put them 
under unified control or liberalize them? There is currently 
great controversy over this issue. Actually, past experience 
has already told us: The more you put under unified control, 
the less you have; the less you have, the more you put under 
unified control. This is a vicious circle. Whatever is 
liberalized increases. Of course things are not that simple; 
for example, cotton output dropped last year. Here there is 
indeed the problem of guaranteeing a basic production 
capability. If we can't guarantee a basic production 
capability, there will be a major disaster. Even if supply is 
sufficient but prices are high, there will still be disaster. 
The government has to consider all these aspects. But I 
believe that, if we burden farmers with both the guarantee of 
supply and the guarantee of prices, then the farmers' burdens 
are too heavy. Society has many departments and many people -- 
what are the others doing to help? If the farmers have to be 
responsible for the supply of farm products as well as their 
price level, it becomes too difficult. 
  The fluctuation of grain prices last autumn actually sent a 
signal to society. We now face a choice: If we do not raise 
grain prices, supplies will decrease and the farmers' enthusiasm 
will be affected; to motivate the farmers, prices will have to 
be slightly higher. The burden at least should be shared by the 
various groups of society. The issue of grain price reform was 
raised at least seven or eight years ago -- when it was said 
that the consequence of price rises should be born by three 
parties: farmers, urban residents, and government finance. 
Currently, many of the measures make it look like farmers have 
to bear all the burdens. This may lead to trouble. 
  The measures that we are currently adopting to revive grain 
and cotton production so that the government can secure grain 
and cotton resources must take farmers into consideration. We 
must not make the old mistake of wanting the horse to run fast 
while not letting it eat grass. Wanting them to furnish 
supplies without raising prices is very difficult. For example, 
when we went out to investigate at the beginning of the year, 
the farmers thought the average price of 0.5 yuan a jin was 
acceptable. The problem now is that people, whether they are 
farmers or county and township cadres, don't know that you are 
going to come out with a measure which will adjust oil prices 
later on. That is why they feel the price is acceptable. 
However, by the time the price of oil is raised and the summer 
grain has not yet been harvested, they will surely not accept 
the price of 0.5 yuan/jin anymore. If they do not accept it, 
what measures will the government take to control the supply of 
grain? I think we need to seriously consider this kind of 
problem. 
  At the rural work conference, it was decided that the new 
price of crude oil will come into effect on 1 May, but the 
farm-use diesel price will remain unchanged between 1 May and 
the end of June. This is to say, it is still necessary to watch 
the grain price situation. By postponing the change for two 
months, we will be able to take other measures if grain prices 
continue to rise. In a word, wait and see. 
  I did some major calculations. For example, I discussed 
things with people from the means of production company at the 
beginning of April. They believe that, because of the price 
change in chemical fertilizer, farmers will have to pay 11 
billion yuan more. The Ministry of Agriculture estimated that 
if the state fixed price for oil is canceled this year, farmers 
will have to pay 13.2 billion yuan more. Added together, 
farmers will have to pay 24.2 billion yuan more. 
  It can also be clearly worked out how much grain purchases 
will compensate farmers. Say we purchase 130 billion jin of 
grain, and the price of each jin of grain rises by 0.1 yuan. 
This means that 18 billion yuan more can be given to the 
farmers. If we can harvest 70 million dan of cotton and if the 
cotton price is raised by 90 yuan a dan, farmers will get 6.3 
billion yuan more. These two add up to 24.3 billion yuan. 
  This implies that you will pay 24.3 billion more to the 
farmers, who will in turn have 24.2 billion more in expenses. 
The difference is 100 million yuan, which means that each 
farmer will get 0.1 yuan more, while prices of other goods 
continue to rise. If this is the situation, then the farmers 
will have no enthusiasm. 
  Under the current circumstances, a visible problem in grain 
and cotton, especially groceries, is that the prices at which 
farmers sell are not high; it is the difference between 
wholesale and retail that is really large. Therefore, it 
doesn't solve the problem at all if you just tell the farmers to 
sell cheaply. The price of spinach doubles between Dazhongsi 
and Zhongguancun, and the farmers actually don't get much 
benefit from it. Therefore, the government needs to come up 
with reform methods, specifically, more methods to perfect the 
market. If we only take measures to coerce the farmers, we may 
end up in failure, and price fluctuations will be even greater. 
Keeping the prices of farm products stable will serve the 
purpose of maintaining social stability this year. If, however, 
the method we adopt in fact offends the farmers, then the goal 
of social stability will by no means be realized. 
As long as farm products can increase, the farmers' income 
can grow; as long as township and town enterprises can develop, 
the farmers' employment problem can be resolved -- this 
traditional way of thinking needs to be revisited. 
  Currently, on one hand, there is a good situation in the 
countryside, while, on the other, problems abound. We must 
broaden our minds in reform and must realistically admit that 
the many problems we encounter now were not only unresolvable 
before reform, but the experience accumulated in the 15 years of 
reform is also insufficient to solve them. We need to create 
new methods and further emancipate our minds. Two examples 
demonstrate that our ways of thinking are very restricted 
concerning the two problems. 
  First, according to the traditional way of thinking, as long 
as basic farm products increase, the farmers' income will grow. 
This method of thinking was actually shattered already several 
years ago. Sometimes grain production increases, but farmer 
income not only does not rise; it drops in some places. The 
method we adopt to increase farmer income requires serious 
thinking and study, with further emancipated minds. 
  The second challenge is that township and town enterprises 
have sprung up since 1984, and many comrades, including myself, 
thought that, as long as township and town enterprises 
developed, we would be able to solve the employment problem for 
farmers. But in the 1990's, it doesn't seem that way at all. 
Township and town enterprise output value has grown extremely 
rapidly, but the tidal wave of migrant laborers has also been 
rising. Township and town enterprises cannot take in so many 
labor hands. The farmer employment problem and income problem 
are linked. Thus, any new increase in farm products alone 
cannot increase farmer income, and township and town enterprises 
bring only limited job opportunities for farmers. So with so 
many farmers, how do we solve the employment and income 
problems? This is an issue requiring serious thought for the 
remaining years of this century. To a certain extent, the 
increase in the supply of farm products during 1979-1984, the 
continuous increase in subsidies, and the rising prices have 
represented small-scale fix-it measures. So has the practice of 
allowing farmers to run township and town enterprises on the 
basis of one household, village, or township. It seems that, in 
order to appropriately solve this problem, one must consider 
farmer employment and the industrialization, urbanization, and 
modernization processes throughout society as an integrated 
whole. This is a consensus among Chinese and foreign scholars. 
The employment problem facing Chinese farmers is indeed the 
number one difficult problem facing global economics. The 
employment of several hundred million people is no trifling 
business. If it is solved well, the country will be prosperous 
and the people will be strong; if not, there is the possibility 
that the country will fall into chaos. Therefore, our minds 
need further emancipation in this respect. 
  Chen Jiyuan, director of the Rural Development 
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: "Several 
Problems in the Rural Areas Which Urgently Need To Be Studied at 
Present" 
  Fluctuations occurred in last year's grain prices, beginning 
in the south and then spreading to the north, and this caught 
the attention of the party Central Committee and the relevant 
departments. To address this situation, the central meeting on 
rural work held this March raised the slogan of three 
stabilizations and two balances, i.e. realizing "the 
stabilization of cultivated area, output, and grain reserves and 
the balance of total volume and different regions." In order to 
realize this goal, the conference put forward a leading-cadre 
responsibility system and said that cultivating grain and cotton 
was the sacred responsibility and duty of farmers. Currently, 
all these suggestions are necessary and correct, but, from a 
long-term point of view, in order to solve the problems of 
China's agriculture, one must treat the symptoms along with the 
causes and solve the problems from the roots. That is to say, 
one must solve problems by raising agricultural efficiency and 
increasing farmer income. Otherwise, no matter what harsh 
administrative measures are adopted, the problems facing the 
Chinese countryside and agriculture cannot be fundamentally 
solved. 
  How do we fundamentally solve our problems in agriculture? I 
believe that we must first study and clarify the following 
questions by combining theory with practice. 
  Our attitude toward the farmers: In solving the 
rice-sack and shopping-basket problems we must first consider 
the farmers' wallets. 
  Under the planned economic system, for many years the 
state's 
view of farmers was mainly to request grain and cotton from 
them, while the farmers, based or their own needs, wanted to 
increase their income. This contradiction existed for a long 
time. Formerly, under the people's communes system, this 
contradiction was hidden by the system of everybody eating from 
the same big pot. After practicing the contracted responsibility 
system with remuneration linked to output, farmers became 
commodity producers. This contradiction became even more acute 
after the complete switchover to a market economy. Up to now, 
however, this problem has not been solved very well. 
  For example, solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket 
problems is a key component of guaranteeing supplies and curbing 
inflation. This is, of course, correct. But the purpose in 
solving the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems should not 
only be to guarantee supplies, curb inflation, and maintain 
urban stability, but should also increase the income of farmers 
who produce the grain and vegetables, letting them obtain some 
economic benefit. If we only were to solve the rice-sack and 
shopping-basket problems but paid no attention to the problem of 
the farmers' wallets, then in the long run, the shopping-basket 
will not be secure. In grasping agriculture, we should not only 
think about what to take from farmers but should also think 
about what the farmers get. If farmers increase their income by 
producing grain and vegetables and the wallet problem is solved, 
I believe the rice-sack and shopping-basket problems will also 
be solved naturally. 
  The criterion for assessing the grass-roots cadres' 
work is the output value or the quantity of farm products. 
  We have discussed the importance of agriculture for many 
years. We have continued talking about it in the past two years, 
and many words have been said about the correct understanding of 
it. It should be pointed out that Chairman Mao had already 
elucidated the importance of agriculture in "On the Ten Major 
Relationships." For example, we cannot take the Soviet road by 
working farmers too hard, nor can we ask the horse to run fast 
but eat no grass, and so on. In the early 1960's, after some 
problems had occurred nationwide, the party Central Committee 
reiterated the fundamental position of agriculture quite 
comprehensively. By 1978, when the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee was held and the national economy was 
on the brink of collapse, from an economic perspective, it was 
important to solve the agricultural problem. The plenary session 
stated that it was necessary to stabilize one end first and let 
farmers rest and build up strength. Only by stabilizing the 
farmers can the whole country be stabilized. In recent years we 
have continued to emphasize the importance of agriculture. The 
Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee made 
the decision on emphasizing rural and agricultural work. It was 
a very correct decision. After that, between last October and 
March this year, the central authorities called two meetings on 
rural work. One cannot say that we are not concerned about 
agriculture. 
  However, while the central authorities have repeatedly 
emphasized the importance of agriculture and have made so many 
decisions about it, why is it so difficult to implement these 
decisions? Where lies the root of the problem? Perhaps one has 
to seek it in structure. I believe that using gross output value 
as a major criterion for evaluating local cadres is a cause. 
Our party's strategic goal of development has already been 
decided. The party Central Committee has made a decision to 
quadruple the GNP by the end of the century. But, in evaluating 
departments, local governments, and cadres, I think if we only 
judge them according to the growth rate, especially the growth 
rate of gross output value, this will inevitably lead to 
departments and local cadres paying attention to only those 
industries with high output value while neglecting those 
industries with low output value. Agriculture is an industry 
with great social benefit but low output value and low 
comparative efficiency. It is therefore very easily put in the 
most neglected position. If these problems are not solved, the 
problem of neglecting agriculture will be difficult to solve. 
  We now include agricultural production as part of the 
criteria for evaluating achievements in cadres' official 
careers. Has this been implemented? It should be seriously 
checked. In the past, the evaluation of industrial enterprises 
always took gross output value as the central index. Now, 
changes have occurred through reform, but we still lack a 
scientific system for evaluating the work of local governments. 
Studies should be made on this topic. Otherwise, we may talk 
about the importance of addressing this issue every day, but the 
problems will remain unsolved. 
  Conditions for nurturing in return: Are the 
conditions ripe for realizing the transition from agriculture 
nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture in return? 
  We should start from the overall situation and take the 
perspective of combining theory with practice in studying the 
following question: Are the conditions ripe now, or are they in 
the initial stages of becoming ripe, for realizing the 
transition from agriculture nurturing industry to industry 
nurturing agriculture in return? We are basically still not 
clear on this question. The issue of making transitions in 
stages is a basic starting point in policymaking. If we say 
that conditions are already ripe or are initially ripe, then we 
have to come up with a series of new economic policies. If we 
think the turning point hasn't yet arrived, then of course it is 
another matter. 
  Using agriculture to nurture industry is a process that any 
developing country has to go through. China has been in this 
process since liberation; that is, it is using the value created 
by farmers to support the development of industry and the 
development of the urban economy. After a few decades, industry 
has become very strong, and the ratio between industrial and 
agricultural output values has now been reversed, from the 
former 30:70 to 70:20-odd now. This demands that we study our 
development strategy, including issues concerning the expanding 
income gap between industry and agriculture and between urban 
and rural areas. 
  Looking at these aspects, I personally believe that, 
although 
we can't say that the conditions are completely ripe, we can say 
that conditions are initially ripe for the transition from 
agriculture nurturing industry to industry nurturing agriculture 
in return. In fact, industry has already begun to nurture 
agriculture, primarily in the form of township and town 
enterprises nurturing agriculture. Township and town enterprises 
in the coastal regions have played this role. 
  Of course, this is only my personal view. But this question 
is worth serious study. Only then can our agriculture have the 
opportunity to better develop. 
  The application of protection policies. Should we lift 
price controls over the means of agricultural production, 
protect farmers, or do both? 
  Currently, the prices of the means of agricultural 
production 
are up, and farmers cannot afford them. Hence the issue of 
protection has been raised. But how do we protect them? Some 
time back I attended a seminar on the mechanization of 
agriculture. Sales of farm machinery had dropped 30-40 percent 
since the latter half of last year. A RENMIN RIBAO reporter 
wrote a commentary which described it very vividly: Beginning 
in June last year, it was as if farmers had discussed and agreed 
on a course of action; suddenly, no one would buy farm machinery 
any more. It is impossible for so many farmers to have 
discussed and agreed on it. Yet the fact that "suddenly nobody 
would buy" indicates that economic laws are working. Why 
wouldn't farmers buy farm machinery? Why wouldn't they use farm 
machinery? The key is whether it was financially beneficial for 
them. 
  When contradictions occur between farmers and the 
enterprises 
that manufacture farm machinery, what should we do? If we let 
the manufacturers all go bankrupt, it will be difficult to 
revive them later. So we must protect them a little. However, 
under the circumstances that large and medium enterprises are 
switching their mechanisms to enter the market, if we favor the 
farm-machinery manufacturing industry too much, then its ability 
to survive will not grow stronger, and that won't do either. 
Therefore, I believe that, in principle, industry -- i.e., the 
means of agricultural production -- should be liberalized. Let 
it go and compete in the market economy so that efficient 
enterprises will prosper, increase their vitality, and raise 
their product quality. But for farmers we should take certain 
protective measures -- for example, we can let the price of 
diesel oil rise, but we must take certain measures to guarantee 
that the farmers can buy it at a fixed state price. Chemical 
fertilizer is the same. The question boils down to either 
protecting both ends or only one. If, given the soaring prices 
of the means of agricultural production, we don't try to protect 
the farmers' interests, agricultural production will surely drop 
sharply. After farm machinery went into a slump, in many places 
it was just as the newspaper described, "selling the iron ox 
(tractor) to buy the farm cattle." In some places, such as 
Yanqing, some farmers sold their tractors and went to Shanxi to 
buy donkeys. In some places in Shanxi you can see professional 
plowers. They don't use animal power, but manpower. All these 
indicate that, if we still don't take measures and let the 
comparative efficiency of agriculture drop, farmers will be 
unable to afford modern production facilities, and the 
modernization of our agriculture will be difficult to achieve 
and will even hold other things back. Some people suggest 
transferring farmers from cultivating the land to conducting 
large-scale operations on the land. This will raise 
agricultural efficiency and increase farmer income. But this 
requires a long process and requires substantial development in 
the non-farming industries. Water in the distance can't quench 
an immediate thirst. At present, we urgently need to study how 
to implement protective policies toward farmers and agriculture.

  Beginning with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, rural reform has been continuing for 15 
years. Looking back, we can perhaps divide these 15 years into 
the following stages: 
  First stage: From 1979 to 1984, grain and farm 
products increased rapidly, farmer income also rose rapidly, and 
the city and countryside were both happy. 
  During the 1979-1984 period, grain production developed 
rapidly. Nobody thought that the problem of securing adequate 
food and clothing for the majority of the countryside could be 
solved so quickly. The number one factor behind the large 
increase in farm products was the implementation of the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis, and the number two 
factor was perhaps the rise in grain prices, which was fairly 
substantial. At the same time, the state also decided to import 
grain and let the countryside and the farmers rest and 
recuperate. These measures, therefore, greatly benefited the 
rural economy, and farmer enthusiasm was high. For a few years, 
grain production continued to advance past two major milestones, 
each milestone representing an increase of 100 billion jin in 
output. This type of large-scale continuous growth has rarely 
been seen in history. During those years, farmer income 
increased rapidly, reaching an average growth rate of over 10 
percent. With a large increase in farm income, farm products 
increased rapidly. So the government was satisfied, farmers 
were satisfied, and everybody was satisfied. But this created 
an illusion among some, as if agricultural problems would all be 
solved by production contracts and it would be plain sailing 
from then on. 
  Second stage: From 1985 to 1988, grain production 
dropped for one year and remained stagnant for three. Urbanites 
complained loudly, but farmer income still increased to some 
extent. Farmers, therefore, were basically satisfied. 
  In 1984 there was a bumper harvest, but immediately in 1985 
there was a great reduction in yields. Actually, the drop in 
1985 was foreshadowed by signs some years earlier. I remember 
that Comrade Wan Li read a letter at the 1983 Rural Work 
Conference. It was written by someone to his older brother in 
Beijing. It said: You all say that the situation is very good. 
I don't think so. Farmers are no longer willing to grow grain. 
It could already be seen at that time that growing grain was 
not profitable. If cash crops were planted on the same field, 
then the income would be so much more. If the field was turned 
into a fish pond, then the income would be even higher. If a 
factory was built on the land, the income would be higher still. 
At that time, however, the contract responsibility system on a 
household basis was still being pushed forward. Before that, 
the state's grain output had been very low. Therefore, during 
the early years, development had the nature of a recovery. 
Because all areas that practiced the contract responsibility 
system saw the per mu grain output increase -- even though the 
phenomenon of farmers being unwilling to grow grain had appeared 
and grain-growing areas had been reduced -- on the whole the 
total output of grain did not drop or did not drop much. 
Nationwide, therefore, the grain output still rose by a large 
margin. After 1984, however, the situation changed. This 
recovery-based rising trend weakened. Plus, for several years in 
a row, some areas that had reduced their agricultural land had 
made profits, and farmer enthusiasm for growing grain dropped, 
which led to a drop in output in 1985. 
  After document No. 4 of 1984 stipulated some preferential 
policies for township and town enterprises, the township and 
town enterprises developed rapidly. The result was that farmer 
income increased. Therefore, in the four years from 1985 to 
1988, grain output dropped for one year and was stagnant for 
three. Even in 1988 the 1984 level was never regained. 
Urbanites shouted loudly. After three years of stagnant 
agricultural output, people from top to bottom began to pay 
attention. But farmers were still happy. The voice saying that 
without industry there is no prosperity greatly surpassed the 
voice saying that without agriculture there is no stability. 
The "peaceful" scenario left problems for later. 
  Third stage: From 1989 to 1991, grain output went up, 
but the rise in farmer income slowed down. The income of over 
half of the farmers experienced negative growth. 
  After the three years' stagnation, the leadership and the 
rank and file all made efforts, and grain output increased in 
1989. But the rise in farmer income was negative. The total 
rise of income in the three years from 1989 to 1991 was 0.7 
percent. This 0.7 percent was a national average (during that 
period, township and town enterprises in the coastal regions, 
especially in the Zhu Jiang Delta, rose on a large scale; the 
export-oriented enterprises developed; and the growth in their 
income surpassed this ratio). Actually, the income of more than 
half of the farmers experienced negative growth. We reflected 
on and recognized such an important situation very slowly and 
belatedly and failed to take timely and effective measures. It 
wasn't until 1992 that the situation began to change. 
  Fourth stage: From 1992 to the present. Looking back 
and looking ahead into the future, I think the essential element 
of solving the current problems in agriculture and among the 
farmers is to pay great attention to the farmers' interests. 
  The rural reform that began in 1979 has developed smoothly 
all along. But in 1985 grain output started to slip. Urbanites 
were very worried, and some people even began to doubt the 
contract responsibility system on a household basis. Later, 
measures were taken to increase grain production, but the 
farmers' income did not rise. 
  Looking back on it now, the root of the problem was that, 
for 
a long time under the planned system, the state's concern in the 
countryside was only to ask for grain and farm products from 
farmers, while seldom devoting any energy to the construction of 
the countryside itself. It did not pay attention to increasing 
farmer income and paid little heed to the economic interests of 
farmers and the improvement of their living standards. This 
problem has been a long term one. In the state's construction 
plans, careful consideration has been given to the various 
industrial projects that need to be launched -- how much 
investment and what kind of equipment they require -- while 
agriculture seldom or never received this attention. For 
agriculture, the authorities usually just set quotas and 
demanded increases of so much grain or cotton. But what were 
these increases based on? The measures often were not 
implemented. And when contradictions occurred between the city 
and the countryside, the countryside was often sacrificed to 
save the city. 
  Looking at the more than a decade of history since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we feel 
deeply that the spiritual essence of the policies of the Third 
Plenary Session was to end the previous "leftist" practice of 
many years, i.e. the practice of invariably asking something 
from the farmers while paying no attention to their interests. 
There has been real concern for the interests of farmers. Only 
when they had the political right to make their own decisions 
and got real benefits economically was there an unprecedented 
rise in the production enthusiasm among the hundreds of millions 
of farmers. That was what made the miracle in Chinese 
agriculture of the 1980's possible. 
  Today the key to revitalizing agriculture still lies in 
truly 
mobilizing farmer enthusiasm. To this end we must genuinely 
solve the problems of farmers increasing output but not their 
income, the dearth of rural employment opportunities, and the 
fact that it is hard for farmers to get rich. Only if farmers 
get rich can the country become prosperous and strong. 
Countries throughout the world are watching us, thinking that 
China is a large potential market. But only when the purchasing 
power of the large numbers of farmers is raised can this market 
become the world's largest market. 
  In order to raise farmer enthusiasm, we must first resolve 
the question of increasing farmer income and then address the 
rural employment problem. These two are linked. Currently, 
this is evident in the "tidal wave of migrant laborers." It is 
true that, when migrant laborers come, many problems are 
exposed, such as traffic jams and chaos. People, therefore, 
usually see its negative side. Fortunately now everybody has 
also realized that this is a historical trend. The Ministry of 
Labor has been thinking of ways to solve these problems. The 
tidal wave of migrant laborers is nothing other than farmers 
coming, on their own, to look for jobs. The experience of many 
years has shown that farmers will always think of ways to solve 
rural and agricultural problems themselves. The government just 
needs to be a good guide and summarize experiences. With regard 
to such major problems as rural employment, we may have to let 
farmers find their own way. 
  LIAOWANG is a very influential news magazine which has 
always 
paid attention to propaganda concerning rural, agricultural, and 
farmer problems. It has published many influential reports and 
essays. I suggest that LIAOWANG continue this good tradition 
and method. So many new problems are occurring in the 
countryside today, and propaganda must be strengthened so that 
both the leadership and the rank and file will pay appropriate 
attention. I agree wholeheartedly with the kind of meeting you 
are holding today. It doesn't require a lot of people. 
Everybody can say as much as he wants. But one meeting is not 
enough. We should hold several meetings in a row, and get the 
relevant comrades to conduct penetrating studies and discussions 
on several major problems in the reality of agriculture and the 
countryside. 
<H5>  Duan Yingbi, researcher at the Rural Economy Research Center </H5>
of the Ministry of Agriculture: "Reform: The Only Way for 
Agriculture To Get Out of Difficulty" 
  In recent years agriculture has encountered several new 
situations, and many new problems have appeared in the 
countryside. The party Central Committee and the State Council 
are very concerned about agricultural and rural work and have 
implemented a series of policy measures to support agricultural 
production and protect the interests of farmers. At the end of 
1993, General Secretary Jiang Zemin called a Six-Province Rural 
Work Forum in Wuhan, and Premier Li Peng called a National Rural 
Work TV and Telephone Conference in Beijing. These can be seen 
as a turning point in the rural situation. The problem of 
"IOU's" being used to purchase farm products and of the farmers' 
burdens being too heavy, which were common at the time, have 
pretty much been solved. Later on, by strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the outflow of rural 
capital and the occupation of large stretches of land have been 
halted. Last October, the central authorities called a rural 
work conference and came up with various policy measures for 
accelerating the development of the rural economy. In March 
this year, a central rural work conference was again called, 
which made concrete arrangements for agriculture and rural work 
this year. The level of these two meetings was very high. The 
number one leaders of local party committees and provincial 
governors participated, and the general secretary and the 
premier gave long speeches. All these have played a very 
positive role in the development of agriculture and the rural 
economy. Although currently there are still many difficulties 
and problems in agriculture and rural work, we can imagine that, 
had it not been for the strong emphasis on the part of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, rural problems 
certainly would be much more serious than they are now. 
<H5>  What Policies Did the Central Authorities Give to the </H5>
Farmers? 
  After more than four months of preparation, the central 
rural 
work conference came up with 12-point policy measures in light 
of the major problems existing in the countryside. In terms of 
the operating system, it stipulated that, when the current term 
of contracts for cultivated land expire, they should be extended 
for another 30 years without changing the terms, and that 
compensated transfer of land according to the law should be 
allowed. In terms of the circulation system, it stipulated a 
rise in the purchase price of grain and cotton, the 
establishment of grain risk funds and a state reserve system, 
and that the "sale on credit" problem in the grain business 
should be solved within a fixed period. In terms of 
agricultural input, it outlined adjustments in the three 
structures and rises in the three proportions, i.e., the 
proportion of agricultural investment in the state capital 
construction investment, the proportion of agricultural aid fund 
in the state financial budget, and the proportion of 
agricultural credit and loans in the state credit and loans. In 
order to support the economic development of the major grain and 
cotton producing areas, it decided to designate 500 major 
commodity grain producing counties and 150 cotton producing 
counties across the country, and said that the state would make 
arrangements for 6.5 billion yuan in special loans in a 
concentrated effort to help these counties. In order to guide 
agriculture in the direction of high yields, excellent quality, 
and high efficiency, it decided to allocate 1 billion yuan in 
special loans for the establishment of a group of agricultural 
demonstration zones in various places. Targeting the phenomenon 
of the random occupation of cultivated land, it stipulated the 
establishment of a basic farmland protection system and the 
delineation of basic farmland protection zones. Apart from 
this, in terms of science and technology, education, and the 
work of assisting the poor by tackling development projects, 
many concrete measures were also stipulated. Putting them 
together, the increase in special agricultural loans comes to 
22.5 billion yuan per year. 
  All these measures are specific and feasible. They were 
put forward on the basis of a large amount of investigation and 
study and after many meetings were called by the leading 
comrades of the party Central Committee and the State Council in 
order to coordinate with the leaders of the relevant 
departments. Now the problem is that some policy measures have 
not been implemented, and, naturally, the effect of these 
policies cannot be brought into play. That policy measures 
cannot be implemented is indeed a major problem in agricultural 
and rural work. 
<H5>  Where Is the Obstruction? </H5>
  If one asks why some policies of the central authorities are 
not being carried out, this cannot be explained in a few 
sentences. It is caused by many reasons, among which three are 
worth noting. 
  First, the macro environment of agriculture. For a long 
period, we used agriculture to protect industry and used the 
countryside to protect the cities. The countryside had to 
shoulder the task of accumulating funds for the nation's 
industrialization. This situation has not yet been turned 
around and probably will not be completely turned around for 
some time to come. On the one hand, we want to maintain a 
relatively high speed for national economic development; on the 
other, we want to make a transition towards a socialist market 
economic system. Under these circumstances, it is difficult not 
to encounter the pressure of inflation and is difficult not to 
harm the vested interests of some people, because reform itself 
is an adjustment of interest relations. However, since the 
interests of the city are inflexible and untouchable, a fair 
proportion of the risks will have to be born by the countryside. 
Of course, none of us want to have it this way. We all wish to 
give agriculture a better environment, such as rationalizing the 
prices of farm products and increasing inputs for agriculture. 
But this is truly difficult to do. I think the so-called 
"failure to implement policy measures" is related to this macro 
environment. 
  Second, the situation of leadership at the county and 
township levels. These two levels are crucial for agricultural 
and rural work, because various policy measures have to be 
implemented through them. Currently many counties and townships 
are racking their brains over their inability to pay salaries; 
some county offices have kept a few people to man the phones and 
have sent the rest out to make money. Under such a situation, 
how can agriculture and rural work be strengthened? The work at 
the township level is indeed difficult to do. They cannot even 
accomplish the imperative tasks pressed upon them by their 
superiors; when do they have time for rural work? Of course, 
the situation is not the same everywhere, but at least this is 
not an isolated phenomenon. If this situation is not changed, 
it will be very difficult for agriculture to develop. 
  Third, the situation in the rural work organs. On the one 
hand, the organization is incomplete because there is not a 
unified organization to grasp the work. On the other hand, 
there is the problem of spirit. During the 1980's, rural reform 
was heated. In the rural work system the leadership and the 
rank and file were all very enthusiastic. They would go deep 
down into reality, conduct investigation and study, and delve 
into problems. That spirit cannot be compared to what we are 
seeing today. Now, very few people actually go down to the 
townships, villages, or households to investigate, and very few 
investigation reports contain examples and analysis. On the 
contrary, there are many general articles. I think this is also 
one reason why policies "cannot be implemented"! 
<H5>  Let the Countryside Heat Up </H5>
  To solve the current problems in the countryside, in the 
final analysis, we should continue to deepen rural reform, 
implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, and advance toward the goal of a 
socialist market economic system. 
  By now, rural reform is increasingly interwoven with urban 
reform. Many reform measures can no longer be independently 
implemented in the countryside but must be coordinated between 
the cities and the countryside. However, this on no account 
means that there is no room for rural reform. On the contrary, 
there are still many things to do. 
  For example, in terms of the operating system, we can 
realize 
the optimal allocation of economic resources on the basis of 
stabilizing the contract responsibility system on a household 
basis with remuneration linked to output and circulating the 
various production elements in the countryside by different 
means. In this respect, there have already been many 
innovations among the farmers. In some economically developed 
regions, many forms of moderately large-scale operations of 
farmland have been developed by using land use rights as shares 
or transferring land use rights for a price. Farmers in some 
economically underdeveloped regions have gone to contract fields 
in economically developed regions. Recently, in some places in 
the northwest, the development of noncultivated resources has 
been accelerated through the auction of the use rights of 
uncultivated mountains, hills, wasteland, and shoals. These 
innovations should be seriously summarized so as to study their 
applicability and conditions and gradually promote them. 
  For example, in terms of the circulation system, we can do 
some pioneering in developing market intermediary organizations. 
Currently, the main reason why we do not dare lift price 
controls over cotton and part of the grain is the fear that, 
once they are liberalized, there will be chaos and all kinds of 
vendors will go and "loot" the countryside and disrupt the 
market and the prices. Will we then be able to develop farmers 
marketing cooperatives in the countryside? Take grain as an 
example. I think we can use the grass-roots grain management 
offices as a basis to establish grain marketing cooperatives. 
Each household can hand over its grain to the cooperative, 
which will sell the grain directly in the wholesale markets. 
After the deduction of costs and accumulation, the profit can 
then be returned to the farmers according to a certain 
percentage. Cotton can also have cotton cooperatives, with the 
processing stations as a basis. This way one can both reduce 
intermediate links, save on transaction costs, increase farmer 
income, and avoid the situation of the market becoming chaotic 
once it has been liberalized. 
  As for the questions of adjusting the economic structure, 
developing township and town enterprises, building small towns, 
and transferring surplus rural labor, still more problems must 
be studied and still more work has to be done. In a word, we 
should not think that there is nothing more to do in rural 
reform. I hope LIAOWANG weekly will use this format to publish 
more articles on deepening rural reform and, as before, build up 
a momentum for rural reform.

<F P=106> [By Chao Liang: "Persistent Drought Threatens Harvest"] </F>
  [Text] A widespread summer drought will likely affect this 
summer's harvest of winter wheat in the North and seriously 
affect other crops in the South. 
  There have been only 10 millimeters of precipitation since 
mid- May, or 60 to 90 percent less than the average rainfall in 
North China, officials for the State Anti-Drought Office (SADO) 
said yesterday. 
  Rainfall in the South has been 50 to 60 percent less than 
the 
previous years in many parts of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou 
provinces and some coastal areas of Guangdong Province and the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  Sichuan Province is hit by its worst drought in 25 years, 
affecting 115 counties with a population of more than 18.8 
million. 
  In most parts of China, the mercury has been rising higher 
and faster than in previous years, according to meteorologists. 
  As a result, many fields have been parched by the windy and 
hot days that have persisted since late April and early May, the 
SADO's officials said. 
  "The long spell of dry weather has already become a major 
threat to this year's summer harvest in the North because the 
following week is a critical period for the growth of winter 
wheat in the north farming areas," they warned. 
  North China is one of the country's most important areas for 
growing winter wheat. 
  According to the office's latest statistics, the affected 
farmland has reached nearly 8 million hectares including more 
than 5.8 million hectares of summer crops and over 2 million 
hectares of other fields. 
  At least 5.7 million people and more than 5.1 million heads 
of livestock are finding it difficult to obtain enough drinking 
water. 
  The hardest-hit areas of North China include Beijing and 
Tianjin cities, and most parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and 
Gansu provinces, as well as eastern Shandong Province. 
  In Shandong, parts of the Yellow River have repeatedly dried 
up, making it impossible for farmers to irrigate a large number 
of crops and cotton.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Central government 
departments under the Chinese State Council, the country's 
highest governing body, have gotten everything ready to combat 
possible floods from the south to the north between June and 
late August. 
  Those involved in preparations are the Chinese ministries in 
charge of supply and transportation of flood control equipment 
and supplies, such as the ministries of railways, the coal 
industry, electric power and posts and telecommunications. 
  The Ministry of Railways has already completed its annual 
inspection in the south to remove hidden perils. Major Chinese 
oilfields have allocated special funds of up to 70 million yuan 
this year for flood control use. 
  To improve accuracy in weather forecasting, the 
meteorological department has decided to form a combined service 
group to provide timely and accurate analysis of weather 
conditions in areas which are possible targets of heavy flood.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Government Urges Better Protection of </F>
Forests"] 
  [Text] Excess logging in recent years prompted the central 
government to urge all departments and local governments to ban 
misuse of the nation's forests. 
  "The annual quota for allowable tree-felling must be 
strictly 
observed and all activities involving logging, transporting and 
processing of wood must be conducted under licences," the 
government announced. 
  China's boom in construction and development has led to a 
worrisome imbalance between logging and new growth in the 
nation's forests, the statement warned. The supply of mature 
timber is almost exhausted, it was noted. 
  Legal and administrative units of the government may not 
engage in such activities, the government said. 
  Some inspections will be launched later this year to help 
implement the Forest Law and relevant regulations, according to 
the circular issued by the State Council, the country's highest 
governing body. 
  All violations of the Forest Law and regulations, such as 
clear-cutting forests, illegally occupying woodlands and 
indiscriminate hunting of wildlife, will be severely punished, 
it said. 
  Violations rose 16 percent last year, compared with 1992, 
said an official from the Ministry of Forestry. 
  Large profits from trading in timber -- in short supply on 
the market -- attracted more people and even government 
departments to engage in the business, noted the official, who 
declined to be identified. 
  Some culprits, often armed with weapons, had attacked forest 
keepers and looted timber from tree farms. 
  Last year, 31 forest keepers and officials working at timber 
checkpoints were killed, and another 1,200 were wounded, 
according to the official. 
  Booming construction and industrial development zones also 
consumed large amounts of woodland. 
  Some local governments, ignoring the Forest Law and relevant 
regulations, occupied forest-land for other use without approval 
from authorities or sold woodland at very low prices in order to 
attract outside investment for industrial development. 
  As a result, some 450,000 hectares of woodland was lost 
annually for various kinds of development programme or 
construction, said the official. 
  In a bid to curb such unchecked tree-felling and to keep a 
balance between timber growth and consumption, the central 
government has since 1987 required licenses and implemented 
quotas for logging. 
  Despite such measures, the quota was exceeded every year, 
the 
official noted. 
  Although China has increased its forest coverage to current 
13.9 percent from 12.9 percent of national territory five years 
ago, its mature timber is nearly exhausted, with only about 1.96 
billion cubic metres left.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- A China Southern Airlines 
Boeing 737 passenger jet with 131 people on board was hijacked 
by a male passenger to Taiwan on Monday [6 June], landing safely 
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at 7:55 p.m. 
  The airliner had been en route from Fuzhou to Guangzhou. 
  It was the 12th mainland airliner hijacked to Taiwan since 
April 1993. 
  The incident came on the heels of an airline crash in 
Mainland China on Monday that took 159 lives, including that of 
a Taiwan tourist. 
  The International Airline Passengers Association earlier

year rated Mainland China as one of the most dangerous countries 
to fly following five crashes which killed 76 people and the 
frequent air piracy incidents.

  [Text] This is the latest news on the hijacked airplane. 
  It was learned that the person who hijacked the mainland 
Southern Airlines passenger plane to Taiwan this evening was a 
male. Airport police at the Chiang Kai-shek Airport has 
escorted him out of the airplane for interrogation. His motive 
and instruments used in the hijacking are still under 
investigation. 
  Separately, our military spokesman said today that a Boeing 
737 civil passenger airplane of the mainland's Southern 
Airlines, No. 2542, was hijacked at 1120 GMT during its flight 
from Fuzhou to Guangzhou. The plane was closely monitored as 
soon as it was discovered on our radar. 
  The spokesman further pointed out that two (fighter planes) 
from our Air Force base at Jiayi intercepted the plane at 1139 
GMT and escorted it during the flight. The civil airplane 
safely landed at Taoyuan's Chiang Kai-shek Airport at 1156 GMT. 
The hijacked plane has eight crew members and 131 passengers, 
including the hijacker. All people on board are safe. The 
entire case is being handled by the police and the prosecutor's 
office.

  [Text] Legislator Chao Shao-kang yesterday revealed that, 
over the last nearly 30 years, the U.S. company RCA has dumped 
organic waste harmful to human health into self-dug wells near 
its factory, seriously polluting the underground water and soil 
in Taoyuan's Chupei area. To prevent local residents from being 
further harmed by drinking underground water, in addition to 
urging the Environmental Protection Administration [EPA] to 
examine how seriously local soil and underground water have been 
polluted, Chao Shao-kang also hoped the Public Health 
Administration [PHA] would investigate the matter. The 
following is a report by Lin Sung-hua: 
  [Begin Lin recording] Those living in Taoyuan's Chupei area 
should be aware that the underground water you have been 
drinking may have been damaging your health for a long time. On 
2 June, Legislator Chao Shao-kang revealed that organic waste 
generated from manufacturing electronics products by [words 
indistinct] has been dumped either in the areas near the factory 
or into wells the company dug near the factory, and this might 
have caused harmful effects on local residents over the last 
nearly 30 years. Legislator Chao pointed out that the Taiwan 
U.S. RCA Company, whose factory is located in Taoyuan's Chupei 
area, was taken over by General Electric Company in 1986 and was 
again taken over by Thompson Company two years later. When 
Thompson Company purchased the factory, it was worried about 
pollution problems and asked U.S. environmental protection 
company [name indistinct] to take soil and underground water 
samples from the areas near the factory for examination in the 
United States. Results of the examination showed that the soil 
and underground water contained very high concentrations of 
volatile organic substances. Legislator Chao said Thompson 
Company planned to hold a news briefing to explain the pollution 
caused by General Electric. But it was worried that local 
residents might ask for compensation and so decided to seal off 
the wells and close down the factory. Chao Shao-kang said 
[sentences indistinct]. He said the land where the factory is 
located has been sold to China Electric Company and another 
company, who knew nothing about the pollution problem. Because 
the land is within the Taoyuan urban area, it might be developed 
into a commercial or residential area. To prevent more people 
from being harmed, Legislator Chao decided to expose the fact. 
He said both Thompson and General Electric are well-known 
companies throughout the world and they did pollute Chinese 
soil. After making pollution money for nearly 30 years, they 
sold the land at a profit -- their behavior is quite 
contemptible. In addition to asking the government to sue the 
two companies at the International Court, Legislator Chao also 
hoped the EPA will immediately look into how serious the 
pollution is. He also hoped the PHA will conduct epidemic 
diseases examination among local residents so the government can 
assist them in demanding compensation from the two companies.

  [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- Chao Jen-ho, 
secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said 
at a press conference Saturday [4 June] that he hopes Mainland 
China will send influential figures to Taiwan to learn what 
Taiwan people are thinking. 
  Chao said both sides of the Taiwan Strait should step up 
communications, and that if mainland representatives visited 
here, they would realize the fact that Taiwan is a political 
entity. 
  SEF is a semi-official organization set up to deal with 
civilian exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  Chao [words indistinct] he has invited Deng Pufang, son of 
Mainland China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, to visit Taiwan 
[words indistinct] any message through Deng Pufang to his 
father. But he said he would not be opposed to inviting Deng 
here, saying his visit would help cross-strait relations. 
  On his proposed meeting with Tang Shubei, standing vice 
chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Chao said that he hopes Tang can come to 
Taiwan in July or August. 
  The previous Chao-Tang meeting, held early this year 
produced 
no concrete results on the issues of the repatriation of illegal 
mainland immigrants and hijackers, and fishery disputes. 
Meanwhile, on Saturday, SEF again sent a message to ARATS 
concerning the Qiandao Lake incident in March, in which 24 
Taiwan tourists were murdered. It was the ninth time he has 
asked ARATS for help in resolving the incident. In this case, 
SEF asked ARATS which insurance companies and travel agents will 
be involved in compensating families of the Taiwan victims. 
  Relatives of the Taiwan victims Friday protested to the 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), criticizing the government's 
efforts to resolve the affair as weak. They faulted MAC and SEF 
for their incompetence in negotiating a conclusion to the 
incident.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- An unidentified submarine 
was discovered off southwestern Taiwan during a late May 
Republic of China [ROC] military exercise, naval authorities 
said Saturday [4 June]. 
  Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee, 
Chou Ching-hung, chief of staff at the Navy General 
Headquarters, said the ROC naval fleet contained the 
unidentified submarine for 45 hours and 44 minutes. 
  Chou, however, did not say where the submarine was from. 
  He said the sub was in the open sea off Penghu when it was 
spotted by an ROC S-2T anti-submarine aircraft participating in 
the "Han Kuang" wargames. 
  Chou said sonar equipment installed on the Navy's 
anti-submarine helicopters, destroyers and frigates was used to 
pinpoint the sub. 
  The ROC Navy also used its underwater communications system 
to send warning signals to the submarine and ask it to provide 
its identity and nationality. The sub did not respond, Chou 
said. 
  According to a CHINA TIMES report, the ROC naval fleet did 
not attack the unidentified submarine because the vessel 
remained in international waters and did not intrude into 
Taiwan's 12-nautical mile territorial waters. 
  The Navy instead sent four destroyers and frigates to 
contain 
the submarine, the report said. The Navy also dispatched its 
S70C anti-submarine helicopters to monitor the submarine. 
  The report said the submarine left the waters off Penghu on 
the fourth day of the standoff after the four-ship ROC fleet 
opened an exit. 
  The ROC did not mobilize its submarines to contain the 
unidentified sub, the report said. 
  National Defense Minister Sun Chen refused comment on the 
origin of the submarine and whether Mainland China sent the sub 
to collect military information during the ROC military exercise. 
  Sun said the mainland has many submarines. "It surely would 
use its submarines to collect military information in the Taiwan 
Strait," he added. 
  Sun said the ROC Navy is capable of spotting unidentified 
underwater targets and even attacking them. "Local people need 
not worry about such incidents," he added. 
  Naval authorities said about 96 mainland submarines 
regularly 
sail the waters surrounding Taiwan. A mainland submarine was 
spotted in waters 12.5 nautical miles off Anping in southern 
Taiwan two months ago, the authorities said.

  [Text] After hustling and bustling for some time in front 
of the gate of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Office 
Building last evening, many members of the Hong Kong Students 
Union scuffled with the police who were on the alert on the 
spot. Some persons even rushed through the roadblocks put up by 
the police to the sealed-off area. At 2230 [1530 GMT], 13 
members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic 
Patriotic Movement in China, the Alliance of Employees Trade 
Unions, the 5 April Action, and the Chinese Liberal Democratic 
Party arrived at the spot. Again and again they scuffled with 
the policemen in an attempt to climb over the roadblocks to 
reach the sealed-off area. During the scuffle, seeing such a 
situation, the driver of a passing taxi was quite dissatisfied 
with the troublemakers's doings and loudly shouted at them, 
accusing them of being "troublemakers." Hearing the accusation, 
a member of the Chinese Liberal Democratic Party, whose surname 
was Cheng, fiercely rushed out to the street and hurled an 
umbrella at the taxi. Consequently, the police arrested the 
troublemaker.

  [Text] As the world focuses on China for the fifth 
anniversary of the June 4 massacre, Beijing has ordered hotels 
to pull the plug on CNN television broadcasts and tried to 
divert domestic attention elsewhere. Chinese officials complain 
of the West's obsession with Tiananmen and the crushing of the 
student democracy movement as if it had been no more than a 
passing hiccup. It is because it was no such thing that the 
anniversary must not be passed over in silence. 
  Compared with some of China's previous political 
convulsions, 
Tiananmen may seem relatively tame. Yet for hundreds of 
millions of Chinese both inside and outside the country it 
carries greater significance. Not only was it the first 
upheaval to have such an immediate impact on international 
political awareness -- it was also the seminal political 
experience for a generation for whom the Cultural Revolution was 
just a childhood memory. Older Chinese knew to treat the 
apparent political relaxation of the Beijing Spring with 
distrust. The protesters on Tiananmen Square had to discover 
the leadership's ruthless cynicism for themselves. 
  Tiananmen was also a powerful wake-up call for Hong Kong. 
Since 1984, the territory had accustomed itself to assuming 
Britain and China provided stability while Hong Kong delivered 
its own prosperity. The disappointment and anger which drove a 
million people to march through the streets reflected the 
realisation that Chinese rule after 1997 might not be so benign 
after all. 
  In the five years since the crackdown, human rights in China 
have hardly improved. Dissidents are harassed and jailed. 
Political freedoms are nonexistent. Religious worship is 
interfered with arbitrarily. Journalists are jailed for spying. 
Sentences for economic as well as political crimes are harsh. 
<H5>  Indispensable Partner </H5>
  Discontent continues to simmer close to the surface. The 
causes of the unrest that boiled over in 1989 -- arbitrary 
government, economic disruption, and rampant corruption -- 
appear to have worsened in the past two years. 
  Yet while the anniversary has attracted media attention, 
governments have once again begun to come to terms with the fact 
that China is an indispensable partner politically and 
economically. 
  Most European governments followed former United States 
President George Bush in making peace with China during the Gulf 
War and despite the occasional -- and costly -- flirtation with 
Taiwan, most have continued to court Beijing. Under President 
Bill Clinton, however, the United States tried and failed to use 
trade as a lever to force improvements in human rights. To the 
victims of the 1989 military crackdown, and of China's continued 
political repression, that policy gave a glimmer of false hope. 
<H5>  Rekindling Hope </H5>
  It did not work. Its reversal was dictated by economic and 
geopolitical necessity. But, while Mr Clinton's decision to 
separate trade and human rights was the correct one for Hong 
Kong, he has yet to come up with an alternative policy on human 
rights which could rekindle real hope in China and provide some 
reassurance of American support for Hong Kong's continued 
political freedoms after 1997. Meanwhile, now that renewal of 
China's Most Favoured Nation trading status is no longer a 
domestic political issue, future anniversaries may pass 
unnoticed. 
  Of more immediate concern to Hong Kong, however, is an 
apparent change in British policy since the governor's return 
from London last weekend. Although Chris Patten is standing 
firm over his political reform package, which China has said 
will be dismantled in 1997, the government opposes a human 
rights commission and other human rights legislation because it 
would not last beyond the handover. At the same time, while 
exiled activist Han Dongfang has been permitted to stay in Hong 
Kong, U.S.-based Chinese scholars Liu Binyan and Ruan Ming have 
been refused visas to Hong Kong, for fear they may make 
outspoken attacks on Beijing. These may be only the first signs 
of change. But how long will it be before the government begins 
to stifle local reminders of the June 4 massacre? 
  The crackdown five years ago was not a mistake or an 
accident. It was a calculated act of repression, intended to 
reassert total political control after a moment of relaxation. 
That is why senior leaders such as President Jiang Zemin say 
they would do it again if necessary. For Hong Kong to allow 
them to escape without further criticism would be a betrayal of 
the millions who are still suffering from their wounds.

Beijing] 
  [Text] Exiled mainland labour leader Han Dongfang was 
centre stage at Victoria Park last night as thousands of people 
held a candlelight vigil to mark the fifth anniversary of the 
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Mr Han, prevented from 
returning to China last year after being released from jail and 
allowed to go to the United States for medical treatment, sat in 
a sea of swaying lights to address up to 12,000 people. 
  "The memory of flesh and the broken bones under the tanks 
still awakens me from my dreams," said Han, who was later mobbed 
by autograph hunters. "It is the first time that I have joined 
this function, and it is the first time I can talk about my 
feelings for June 4 in public. The memory of the tanks are 
still painful. 
  "I will always remember that I am a survivor, and a survivor 
has his own dreams." 
  Organisers of the vigil, who claimed that up to 45,000 
people 
attended, strode solemnly through the crowd to lay a wreath at 
the feet of a replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue that 
had been the focus of the student protests in Beijing. 
  Legislator and chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support 
of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Szeto Wah, 
discounted rumours that his organisation was about to fold. 
"The struggle must continue, especially on a piece of land 
which will return to China so soon," he said. 
  Local trade unionist, Lee Cheuk-yan, said Hong Kong people 
would always remember the dead of Tiananmen even if Beijing a 
put a stop to open protests after the handover. "We are very 
sure people will continue to support democracy in China even 
after 1997," he said. "After five years they have not a 
forgotten. They will not forget after 1997, even if the 
authorities at that time do not allow us to hold this sort of 
activity," he said. 
  A small band of protesters later moved on to the Happy 
Valley 
headquarters of Xinhua (the New China News Agency), setting up 
an altar to democracy. Police were reported to have ordered 
several people to move on. 
  In Beijing, the heavy security seen all last week was still 
apparent, but the mood in the capital appeared more relaxed as 
it became clear that the fifth anniversary of the massacre would 
pass without any major incident. Uniformed and plain-clothes 
police were again out in force in Tiananmen Square and the 
northwestern university district, but life in the city carried 
on much as it would on any other Saturday. Most of the more 
than 100 police officers stationed in and around Tiananmen 
Square were content to sit and watch tourists pose for 
photographs. 
  The Monument to the People's Heroes in the centre of the 
square where students made their last stand five years ago was 
securely roped off to everybody, except a group of primary 
school children in pristine red and white young pioneers 
uniforms who formed a guard of honour on the uppermost level. 
Many of the tourists from outside Beijing who visited the 
square seemed unaware of the significance of the day. 
  All the major universities in Beijing were again closed off 
to unauthorised visitors and police maintained road blocks at 
key intersections around the campus of Beijing University. But 
the police seemed relatively relaxed, allowing several foreign 
journalists into the university district but making sure no one 
went on campus. The residents of the university district, which 
includes Beijing's so-called Silicon Valley, did not appear 
bothered. "It's nothing to do with me, why should I care if 
there are police outside my door," an employee of one computer 
firm said. "It's like this every year; you get used to it after 
a while."

  [Text] Following top-level discussions with China's 
economic czar, Zhu Rongji, one of Hong Kong's business leaders 
is now convinced that the gloom over the country is being 
overdone and the economy is being brought under control. "He 
(Mr Zhu) feels very confident that what he's done, and some of 
the measures he's put in, are beginning to show signs of moving 
the overall economy in the right direction," said Mr Paul Cheng, 
who led a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce delegation to 
Beijing last week. 
  Mr Cheng, the chamber's former chairman, said that, in a 90- 
minute meeting with Mr Zhu, the Chinese vice-premier revealed 
some key numbers which "provided some confidence to our 
delegation that things are basically under control". 
  Mr Zhu said: 
  -- The amount of money issued, which doubled a year ago, was 
down to 20 percent year-on-year. 
  -- The rate of heavy construction investment was down to 30 
percent from 70 percent a year ago. 
  -- The yuan had been maintained at a stable level of 8.7 to 
the US dollar over the last few months. 
  -- The profitability of the state sector increased 40 
percent 
in the first four months, although growth rose only five per 
cent. 
  -- Foreign reserves were up to US$30 billion, from $21.1 
billion in January. 
  Mr Cheng said Mr Zhu was optimistic that he could bring both 
the country's annual economic growth and inflation to 10 
percent, although the former chamber leader forecast higher 
inflation. "(Mr Zhu) He maintains that inflation and gross 
national product growth will both be 10 percent. He thinks he 
can still do it, although my own view is that inflation will 
probably be higher," he said. Asked if he detected a hard-sell 
approach by Mr Zhu, Mr Cheng said: "I didn't detect any 
overselling on his part. He was just stating the facts to us." 
  China's economy expanded by 13.4 per cent last year, while 
inflation reached 14.7 percent on a national level and 19.6 
percent in the major cities. Such unsustainable rates have 
prompted calls by foreign economists to rein in the runaway 
economy before serious structural and social problems set in. 
  Last month, for example, World Bank managing director Ernest 
Stern urged Beijing to manage the overheating economy and 
inflation if it wanted economic growth to continue. In slowing 
economic growth to nine percent and inflation to 10 percent, 
China has, among other things, clamped down on new fixed-asset 
investments -- except for state-approved projects -- issued 
bonds to finance the budget deficit and tightened lending to 
state enterprises. 
  Mr Zhu suggested that through the media, foreigners had 
overstated the seriousness of China's economic overheating. Mr 
Cheng said: "He was not denying that the economy was overheated 
to some degree, but he said you need to understand why the 
economy arrived at that stage." 
  Mr Zhu produced figures which Mr Cheng said he had never 
seen 
put together before. The vice-premier said one reason for the 
overheating was colossal infrastructure investment, and that no 
country in the world had devoted the sort of attention to 
capital construction that China did last year. He said that 
last year alone, the country installed almost 2,000 miles of 
railways and highways, 15 million telephone lines and 15 million 
kilowatts of power generation capacity. "No country ever in its 
history has pumped all these activities in one year. Naturally, 
you could create a sort of ballooning effect," Mr Cheng quoted 
the Chinese leader as saying. 
  Mr Zhu said another cause of inflation had been the increase 
in farm produce prices to shore up the agriculture sector in an 
effort to check the shift of the farming population to coastal 
areas in search of better jobs. Mr Cheng said: "They have to 
raise farm produce prices to keep the incentive for farmers to 
stay and continue to shore up that side of the economy. And, by 
raising the prices, you're bound to fuel inflation." 
  The vice-premier said he would wait for reforms in place to 
filter through before considering additional measures to preen 
the economy. In spite of the inevitable provincial resistance 
to the tax reforms implemented in January, 22 percent extra had 
been collected in tax revenue in the first four months of the 
year, compared with the same period last year. 
  Mr Zhu added that the state sector's share of the economy 
had 
fallen to 48 percent, and that half of those losing money were 
small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Cheng said: "What he's 
trying to say is that the major organisations are doing okay, 
but a lot of the small and medium ones are not doing so well. 
  "And when he puts in his reform measures, naturally, the 
impact will be heavier on the small and medium enterprises.

  [Text] It was revealed that based on an initial study by 
our military, the unidentified submarine our Navy monitored is 
believed to be a Chinese Communist (R-Class) submarine. 
However, informed sources said unless a submarine is forced to 
expose its identity or surface above water, no country would 
admit ownership. Because our military did not force it to 
expose itself, its identity cannot be confirmed as yet. 
  It was also learned that yesterday a National Defense 
Ministry [NDM] official pointed out that an incident like this 
would not lead to a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait. 
Defense Minister Sun Chen also said that because the Chinese 
Communists have a large number of submarines and these 
submarines could not simply stay in their bases, their 
activities along our coast can be expected. Lieutenant General 
(Chou Ching-hung), chief of staff of the Navy, yesterday also 
told reporters at the Legislative Yuan that there have been 
frequent submarine activities in the Taiwan Strait. (Lin 
Yu-fang), director of Tamkang University Institute for Strategic 
Studies, said that the Navy's success in pinning down an 
intelligence-gathering submarine proves that the Navy's 
antisubmarine system is capable of coping with the Chinese 
Communists' submarine activities and that our purchase of 
submarines from other countries to strengthen our naval power 
remains crucial to security in the Taiwan Strait. Our reporter 
Liu Yu-mei has this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Liu] The NDM has confirmed that in the 
course of the Han Kuang military exercise, which involved both 
air and naval forces, a Chinese Communist submarine approached 
in an attempt to gather military intelligence. Our Navy sent 
S-2T and S70C antisubmarine helicopters and warships to pursue 
and block its way for as long as two days. Finally, they opened 
an exit to let the Chinese Communist submarine go. 
  (Li Yu-fang), director of the Tamkang University Institute 
for Strategic Studies, said: Although the Control Yuan a few 
days ago approved the censure of NDM officials involved in the 
purchase of S- 2T's, the submarine incident indicated that our 
antisubmarine system can indeed monitor Chinese Communist 
submarines and that it demonstrated our military's capability to 
deal with any crisis. 
  [(Li Yu-fang)] Our response and action during this incident 
are truly praiseworthy. First, from a purely military point of 
view, we were capable of pinning down the Chinese Communist 
submarine. In addition, we were able to react quickly and lay 
siege to it. What we want is not war but military stability in 
the Taiwan Strait. If we were to pin it down indefinitely, the 
Chinese Communists would most likely send other submarines or 
even aircraft to rescue it. In that case, clashes would be 
difficult to avoid. Thus, we let the Chinese Communists learn a 
lesson and then resolved the crisis to avoid a clash. 
  [Liu] Regarding the two sides' military strength, the 
Chinese 
Communists have publicly claimed that it has more than 90 
submarines. However, the number of those that could be used in 
combat was generally believed to be around 40. However, this 
number is still far greater than what we have today. Purchasing 
submarines from other countries will remain crucial to security 
in the Taiwan Strait. 
  [(Li Yu-fang)] I believe this incident is important in 
(words 
indistinct) military clashes in the Taiwan Strait. It would not 
be easy for the Chinese Communists to launch an all-out war 
against Taiwan as soon as war starts. The most important thing 
for them is to seal off the Taiwan Strait. [words indistinct] 
  (Lin Cheng-i), a researcher at the Academia Sinica, hoped 
that we would publish information regarding Chinese Communist 
activities in the Taiwan Strait. [words indistinct] [end 
recording]

  [Text] The Control Yuan passed an impeachment motion 
yesterday morning regarding S-2T antisubmarine helicopter 
purchases. Eight high-ranking Air Force officers -- including 
Generals Kuo Ju-lin and Chen Shing-ling, former Air Force 
commanders-in-chief; three lieutenant generals who handled the 
case; and three major generals -- will be impeached and [words 
indistinct] for negligence of duty in violation of the law 
because their poor planning has delayed an upgrading of combat 
effectiveness and affected combat readiness. 
  The motion, which was filed by Control Yuan members (Li 
Sheng-i) and (Chao Jung-yao), involves the highest military 
officers in the history of Control Yuan impeachment proceedings 
against the military. It also represents the first time that 
the Control Yuan has impeached top-ranking generals who were 
formerly chiefs of the general staff. The people being 
impeached include Gen. Kuo Ju-lin and Gen. Chen Shing-ling, who 
were former Air Force commanders-in- chief; Lt. Gen. (Hsia 
Tian), former deputy chief of the Defense Ministry's planning 
section; Lt. Gen. (Kuo Yun), former chief of the Defense 
Ministry's purchasing mission in the United States; Lt. Gen. 
(Lin Ke-cheng), former deputy chief of the Defense Ministry's

logistics office; and Maj. Gen. [name indistinct], deputy chief 
of the Air Force General Headquarters logistics office. 
  The eight military officers being impeached were in charge 
of 
purchasing S-2T antisubmarine helicopters while in office. They 
have since left their posts.

  [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
Air Force last month took delivery of the first of four E-2T 
airborne early warning aircraft it purchased from the United 
States, and is scheduled to receive the remaining three before 
the end of November, a ranking Air Force official said Saturday 
[4 June]. 
  "The arms deal is proceeding as scheduled," Air Force 
Major-General Lin Yu-ching, deputy chief of staff of the Air 
Force General Headquarters, said during a report to the 
Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee. 
  The Air Force has sent 33 servicemen to the US to prepare 
for 
the commission of the four aircraft, Lin said, adding that 
another 72 will be sent to the US later. 
  Lin also countered reports that the four planes are out of 
date. The US, he said, responded favorably to Taiwan's request 
for four E-2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft in 1991, but 
demanded that some parts from the older E-2B be used in the 
planes. The change was made to comply with the 1987 Shanghai 
Communique, which governs relations between the US and Mainland 
China. 
  The legislature earlier approved a Ministry of National 
Defense budget of NT [new Taiwan] $5.2 billion (US$192.6 
million) for the purchase of the four aircraft.

  [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) on Friday [3 June] announced the abolition of restrictions 
on foreigners investing in domestic banks -- another step in 
Taiwan's financial liberalization and internationalization. 
  Foreigners and overseas Chinese were barred from investing 
in 
domestic banks even after the government lifted the ban on the 
establishment of new banks in 1990. But from now on, MOF 
officials stressed, foreign investors will be allowed to open 
new commercial banks on an equal footing with domestic investors. 
  Foreigners must still abide by Article 25 of the banking 
law, 
which sets the maximum stake of any one investor in a single 
bank at 5 percent, the officials noted. 
  In addition, they said, the remittance of investment funds 
should comply with the requirements for securities investment 
and foreign exchange settlement by overseas Chinese and 
foreigners. 
  The MOF and the Investment Commission under the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs will jointly screen applications from abroad, 
they added.

  [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- Although more than 95 
percent of both Taiwan's and Japan's industrial firms are small 
or medium-sized, the Taiwan firms lag far behind their Japanese 
counterparts in technology development, the cabinet's Council 
for Economic Planning and Development reported Friday [3 June]. 
  According to data released by the council, the technology 
development capability of Taiwan industries is only one-13th 
that of Japanese industries. On the scale, which sets America's 
technology development capability at 100, Taiwan industries 
score just 4.14 points, slightly higher than South Korea's 3.66 
points, but lagging far behind Japan's 55.22 and Germany's 21.37 
points, the council said. 
  Council officials attributed the strong competitiveness of 
Japan's small and medium-sized industrial enterprises to the 
full governmental support and financial assistance they receive. 
  Subsidies provided by the central or local government for 
research and development projects of Japanese small and 
medium-sized industrial enterprises are generally about 50 
percent of each project, and sometimes more than 65 percent. 
Public banks in Japan also offer special low-interest loans for 
small and medium-sized enterprises' R&amp;D projects. 
  In addition, 7 percent of their annual R&amp;D budgets are 
tax 
deductible, the officials noted, adding that cooperation between 
public research and academic units and the private sector is 
another major factor that helps boost the technological 
performance of Japanese industries, the officials said.

  [Text] Moscow, June 4 (CNA) -- There is little chance that 
Moscow will allow nuclear waste from Taiwan into Russia for 
disposal and reprocessing, according to an official from the 
Russian Atomic Energy Ministry. 
  [words indistinct] Kotlov, section chief in the ministry's 
Information Department, said in an interview that legal 
restrictions and the potential public outcry would prevent a 
deal from being struck. 
  "Article 50 of the law on the protection of the environment 
states that no nuclear waste can be brought into Russia from 
abroad. Furthermore, President Yeltsin signed Special Decree 
Number 452 in [date indistinct], which explicitly bans this kind 
of toxic material from entering the country," Kotlov said. 
  Following his recent visit to Russia, Taiwan Power Co. 
Chairman Cang Chung-chien announced in Taipei May 29 that Taiwan 
might send both low and high-level nuclear waste to Russia in 
the future. Chang specifically mentioned that Russia's Kurchatov 
Institute can process low-level nuclear waste and spent fuel. 
  Russian ecologists were originally alerted to the proposed 
deal through a report in the Moscow daily IZVESTIA, which said 
Taiwan officials participating in a scientific conference on 
nuclear technology in St. Petersburg held initial talks with the 
representative of an unnamed research center that manages 10 
nuclear waste dumping sites in Russia. Russian ecologists 
claim Mainland China and Sweden both received similar offers to 
process Taiwan nuclear waste, but said Beijing did not bother to 
reply and Stockholm flatly refused. 
  Kotlov said that in theory, nuclear waste from atomic power 
stations constructed overseas with Russian technology and 
assistance could be brought back to Russia under certain 
conditions. He [word indistinct], however, that the possibility 
of revitalizing cash-strapped projects with funds from potential 
Taiwan contractors might be considered, but only if "there were 
an official request." 
  But he also explained that construction of facilities to 
process nuclear waste stalled after [words indistinct] due to 
lack of funds. He said that although funding for nuclear waste 
storage and disposal projects would soon be re-examined in the 
state Duma, "it is unlikely the work will resume in the next few 
years" due to cuts in the [words indistinct] budget.

  He said the government will take measures to deal with the 
drug problem, including strengthening the anti-drug campaign and 
educating and assisting drug addicts in returning to normal

information on drugs in primary school and junior high school 
textbooks, he said. Hsu said he hopes the general public will 
join hands with the government to jointly create a healthy 
society free from drugs. 
  The conference opened Friday, an anti-drug day in Taiwan. 
Some 74 kilograms of seized heroin, worth NT [new Taiwan] $6 
million (US$ [figure indistinct]) was burned to coincide with

  [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- A delegation from the 
southern Holland city of Den Bosch arrived in Taipei Sunday [5 
June] to court Taiwan investors and business partners. 
  Mayor Don Burgers of Den Bosch, who led the four-member 
delegation for the second visit here this year, said his city is 
joining hands with two other cities in the vicinity to become an 
electronics hub in Europe. 
  One of the cities, Eindhoven, is the home of world-renown 
electronics company Philips. 
  To attract Asian investors, Den Bosch, a sister city of 
Hsintien in Taipei County, recently set up a Far East trade and 
business center which includes duty-free warehouses, rental 
offices and other facilities, Burgers said in a news conference. 
  Burgers said Taiwan businesses can use Den Bosch as a 
springboard to other markets in the European union. 
  Den Bosch is located near Holland's Amsterdam and Roterdam, 
Germany's Dusseldorf and Belgium's Brussels, he said. 
  Burgers, who is on his fifth visit to Taipei, said more than 
10 Taiwan companies have established production centers in Den 
Bosch. Among the Taiwan companies, First International Computer 
Inc. has made Den Bosch its operation headquarters in Europe. 
  An optimistic burgers estimated that the number of Taiwan 
companies in Den Bosch will double in two years. 
  The city government has even helped Taiwan businessmen 
establish a Taiwan school in Den Bosch, further improving the 
city's appeal to Taiwan investors.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou 
Jiahua called for continued nationwide price inspections to 
check inflation. 
  Price rises have slackened recently, but it is necessary to 
continue to curb inflation, to stabilize the market and to lower 
prices, the vice-premier told a three-day national conference on 
price inspection, which closed today in Beijing. 
  Zou said that the aim of the price reform is to build a 
market price system with a reasonable resource distribution and 
indirect government control. 
  To achieve this goal, it is imperative to change the price 
formation mechanism, straighten out the price system and reform 
traditional price management. 
  But the vice-premier stressed that even if the price reform 
is completed, the government will still exercise controls of 
various forms over commodities and services either under state 
monopoly or necessary for the public good. 
  He pointed out that after state controls over prices are 
lifted, it is necessary to transform the price mechanism and to 
raise the prices of basic products and infrastructural 
facilities in a gradual, planned way. 
  Currently, he said, price hikes are accompanied by fake and 
shoddy goods and staggering profiteering. Efforts must be made 
to crack down upon these illegal activities, he said. 
  Zou noted that the relationship between macro-controls over 
market prices and economic growth must be handled correctly. 
  In addition, governments at all levels must pay attention to 
price legislation, he said, adding that a price law and 
regulations curbing cheating, price gouging for unreasonable 
profits and monopolies must be formulated soon. 
  To check price rises, the State Council, China's cabinet, 
will again send inspection groups to provinces and autonomous 
regions across the country in mid-June.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State Begins New Drive To Steady Prices"] </F>
  [Text] The State Council, China's cabinet, once again, in 
mid-June, sent price monitoring teams across the country, to 
continue efforts to bring prices under control. 
  Leaders at all levels should correctly perceive the meaning 
of "price reform," Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said at the closing 
session of a national meeting on price monitoring. 
  He emphasized that price reforms help establish a socialist 
market economy. 
  He observed that some people think government will let 
producers and retailers set prices freely after price reforms 
are in place. 
  "This is totally a misunderstanding of price reform," Zou 
said. 
  China will establish a price system mainly based on market 
demand and supply, and a price readjustment mechanism supervised 
by the government. 
  He conceded that price reforms have a long way to go, 
although control on prices of most commodities have been lifted. 
  The vice-premier revealed that the government would continue 
to adjust the prices of some essential materials and utilities 
in line with market reforms. He did not elaborate. 
  Zou blamed profiteering, marketing of shoddy and inferior 
goods and fraud for the current price rises adding that this 
problem must be solved through nationwide price inspection. 
  Monitoring also is expected to control market price 
fluctuations and prevent unauthorized price hikes. 
  "China's overall economy and local development will both 
benefit from this," Zou told the meeting. 
  He called on local authorities to keep pace with the central 
government, to take uniform action to curb price hikes. 
  "Governments at all levels must put price inspection on top 
of their working agendas," he said. 
  He called for faster drafting of China's price laws and 
regulations, prohibiting profiteering and price cheating. 
  The State Council at the end of March sent six price 
inspection teams to 14 provinces to promote efforts in curbing 
inflation. 
  Price inspectors have, during the two months from March 10 
to 
May 10, uncovered more than 190,000 cases of price violations, 
involving some 400 million yuan ($46 million) in illegal price 
charges.

  [Text] Beijing, June 2 (CNS) -- Vice Premier of the State 
Council of China Mr Li Lanqing made an inspection tour in Wuhan, 
capital of Hubei Province from May 28 to June 2 to investigate 
development of the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing 
Corporation there, saying a big problem facing the automobile 
industry in China was its decentralized layout resulting in a 
number of "small but all inclusive" enterprises and repetition 
of establishment of such enterprises at a low level, thus it was 
difficult for China's automobile industry to participate in the 
international competition in terms of quality, production cost 
and technology. The automobile industry in the country should 
concentrate in producing a number of backbone enterprises to 
meet the international challenge and competition. 
  China has listed its automobile industry as one of the 
pillar 
industries of the country. Facing the grim situation of 
re-entry GATT, the State Council has enacted the new industrial 
policy for the automobile industry and the relevant document 
will be published in not far distant future. According to the 
document, the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing Corporation, 
the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory, the Shanghai 
Automobile Manufacturing Factory and the Tianjin Automobile 
Manufacturing Factory have become the four biggest car 
manufacturing bases in the country. Support should be given to 
certain key enterprises in the improvement of their economic 
performance by bettering management so as to speed up their 
development. 
  Mr Li asked the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing 
Corporation to increase its production capacity of Fu Kang-XZ 
car, which was co-produced with the Citron Group of France, to a 
size of annual output of 150,000 cars, increasing the rate of 
product indigenization and reducing production costs while 
guaranteeing quality of products. 
  There are now more than 120 automobile manufacturing 
factories in the Mainland, most of which are considered by Mr Li 
as "repetition at a low level". At a cross-road of co-existence 
of opportunities and challenge, Mr Li said China's automobile 
industry must solve the problem of "small size, decentralized 
layout and disorder in production" in a bid to develop backbone 
enterprises which have ability of technological development, 
ability of production in a large scale and perfect marketing and 
service network. 
  Mr Li made it clear that China would not approve the 
establishment of any new automobile manufacturing factory 
including joint ventures in the coming years but would welcome 
foreign businessmen to develop, research and produce on a large 
size automobile accessories for the purpose of export.

upper house Speaker Bunbei Hara, who arrived in Beijing on the 
same day, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen touched on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear arms development and said: "We do not 
know its true intention whether it is trying to promote 
development of nuclear weapons or trying to improve ties with 
the United States by using this issue." Moreover, he disclosed 
his view, saying: "Japan and the ROK are the countries which 
will be affected directly (by the nuclear development), in 
particular. Therefore, we would like to continue to insist on 
the need to settle the issue through discussions."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Katsutoshi Sakota] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr -- During an interview with TOKYO 
SHIMBUN Chairman Miichiro Kato on 13 April, Chinese Vice Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen asserted that the issue 
concerning North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections 
should be resolved through dialogue. Because of its expectation 
that China will persuade the DPRK to accept full inspections, 
the United Nations Security Council recently issued a 
non-binding presidential statement while avoiding the adoption 
of a resolution urging North Korea to accept nuclear 
inspections. Nonetheless, Vice Premier Qian's remarks during 
the interview suggest that China also finds it difficult to deal 
with the DPRK issue because what it can do is just call for 
PRC-DPRK talks. 
  Behind China's soft stance lies its fear that if hard-line 
measures such as economic sanctions are adopted, this will deal 
a decisive blow to North Korea, which is currently in a serious 
economic crisis. 
  Such being the case, social unrest will be produced and this 
will inevitably affect China. Unlike the United States which is 
separated from North Korea by the Pacific Ocean, China is the 
DPRK's neighbor. Thus, it is a matter of course for Beijing to 
cautiously handle the DPRK issue. 
  Although China is now hastily promoting a shift to a social 
market economy, problems such as inflation have arisen in the 
process. Thus, China itself has already had the seeds of social 
unrest. It appears that Beijing is trying to avoid another 
disturbing factor, which is political unrest in North Korea. 
  It is also possible that China's influence over the DPRK is 
not as great as Western nations expect. Vice Premier Qian 
flatly denied the possibility of mutual visits by top leaders of 
China and North Korea in the near future, thus giving no 
indication that China will take action to persuade the DPRK. 
  There is a report saying that North Korea recently provided 
weapons to the Cambodian Government army. This suggests that 
North Korea is making its own efforts to avoid being isolated 
from the international community. 
  For the time being, China will keep watching such efforts by 
the DPRK to pay respect to its independency. Although Western 
nations believe that China possesses a diplomatic "weapon" 
toward Pyongyang, which is its influence over North Korea, it 
might be valuable for China not to use it.

  [Text] Beijing, 2 April -- Issei Inoue, deputy chairman of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and other members 
of the SDPJ delegation which is visiting China met with Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April and exchanged opinions 
on the DPRK nuclear issue. Foreign Minister Qian appraised 
positively the fact that the UN Security Council [UNSC] adopted 
the chairman's mildly worded statement rather than hinting at 
the possibility of imposing sanctions on the DPRK in the future. 
He said, "It helped to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and 
gave (the people concerned some leeway in terms of time to 
settle the issue peacefully)." 
  Foreign Minister Qian also touched on China's influence on 
North Korea and pointed out, "Like Japan, China is not a party 
[directly] concerned." In this way, he reminded the 
delegation's members not to expect too much. As has been said 
before, he insisted on a settlement through dialogue between the 
four parties: the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.

<F P=106> [Article by Keiji Kobayashi, editorial staff member: "The </F>
Reason Why the PRC Is Not Enthusiastic in Persuading North 
Korea"] 
  [Text] In the PRC, there is an expression "sanko-no-rei" 
[visit three times]. In the old days, Liu Bi, the emperor of 
the Kingdom of Shu, visited Zhuge Kongming at his house three 
times, trying to persuade him to become his military advisor. 
The expression has been derived from this story. 
  In dealing with the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected 
development of nuclear arms, the PRC did not respond to 
"sanko-no-rei." 
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the United States, 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, and President Kim 
Yong-sam of the ROK visited Beijing one after another to request 
cooperation in applying economic sanctions to North Korea, which 
is refusing nuclear inspections. However, the PRC did not say 
yes to any of them. 
  Economic sanctions without the participation of the PRC are 
meaningless, as the PRC is the largest trade partner of North 
Korea. It has become necessary for the United States, the ROK, 
and Japan to rebuild their strategy. 
<H5>  A Feeling of Distrust Against the United States Exists Among </H5>
the PRC Military Authorities 
  Why has the PRC's attitude has become so stubborn? A Chinese 
source in Tokyo pointed out three reasons: 
  First, the PRC's judgment is that the DPRK has not yet 
succeeded in developing nuclear weapons. According to the ROK's 
mass media, PRC leaders reportedly said at a meeting with 
President Kim that "North Korea has not yet succeeded in 
developing nuclear weapons. If the country is serious in 
developing the nuclear weapons, we will be responsible for 
curbing their intentions." 
  While this report was denied quickly after taking North 
Korea's position into consideration, the report sounds quite 
reliable. 
  The PRC's judgment may be that it is not a preferable policy 
to corner North Korea with suspicions of its nuclear ambitions 
-- which is merely a pretentious "card" -- thus forcing the 
country to actually develop nuclear weapons, and to increase the 
danger of creating military confrontation. Also, the PRC is 
afraid that economic sanctions may further aggravate the already 
weakened North Korean economy and might cause its government to 
collapse. 
  Second, there exists in the PRC a feeling of distrust toward 
the United States. Reportedly, because of the human rights 
diplomacy of the United States, and because of the intervention 
with the Tibetan issue, anti-U.S. nationalism is being created 
within the PRC, with hawks gaining influence with the military 
authorities. 
  At the UN, the PRC was ahead of the United States -- which 
was to propose a "resolution to recommend reinspection" -- in 
proposing a "chairman's statement" of a flexible nature. This 
may be an expression of its aversion toward the United States 
taking the initiative in UN operations. 
  Third, the PRC intends to keep "the DPRK card." While the 
PRC currently does not have enough strength of its own to 
influence North Korean actions, it expects Pyongyang to take the 
PRC's ideas into acount if Beijing refuses the requests of the 
United States, the ROK, and Japan. It is the PRC's deliberate 
calculation that its international influence will be 
strengthened if it can make timely use of this card and succeed 
in persuading North Korea. 
  Besides, though not openly expressed, the PRC doubts the 
justice of resorting to forced measures such as economic 
sanctions. 
  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is an unequal 
treaty, under which possession of nuclear arms is permitted for 
those countries which already possess nuclear arms and 
prohibited for those countries which are trying to develop 
nuclear arms. 
  After all, it is to be decided by individual countries 
whether or not to join the NPT, and such a decision is not to be 
forced by international law. If a country withdraws from the 
NPT, it becomes free from the obligation to undergo nuclear 
inspections. 
  For example, India and Pakistan, while possessing nuclear 
devices, are not members of the NPT and thus are not subject to 
nuclear inspections. Also, North Korea is different from other 
nations such as Iraq because it has not invaded foreign 
countries. Even if North Korea happens to be a dangerous country 
which is unfriendly to the international community, the 
justification for members of a town attacking a certain family 
in the town on grounds that the family is disturbing the town's 
harmony is questionable. 
  Noteworthy Comment by North Korea's Ambassador 
  It seems that, perceiving a certain atmosphere in the 
international community toward North Korea, the United States 
has changed its strategy to include both forcible and flexible 
approaches. 
  Also, for the time being, the ROK -- which has the right to 
announce the reopening of "Team Spirit," a U.S.-ROK joint 
military maneuver -- is supposed to try to find a way to reopen 
talks with North Korea, emphasizing its ability to cope with 
negotiations over the nuclear issue. 
  Unfortunately, hard-line elements opposing North Korea's 
inflexible attitude are gaining strength within the ROK, making 
it difficult for the Kim Yong-sam government to follow a 
flexible line. 
  On the other hand, contrary to its radical words, North 
Korea 
also seems to be trying to find a way to open the talks. 
  The statement of North Korea's ambassador to Austria that 
"we 
are ready to agree to the nuclear inspection to be newly 
effected if the United States agrees to hold talks with us 
again" is considered to be a trial balloon expecting reopening 
of the talks. 
  The DPRK leaders also seem to be aware that it is difficult 
to reconstruct the economy and to remain in power if their 
country is isolated from the international community.

Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference 
after holding talks with Li Shuzheng, head of the CPC 
International Liaison Department, on 16 May. Giving a bitter 
smile, Kubo said: "There has been no major change since April of 
last year when an SDPJ delegation visited China." He made the 
remarks because, although Kubo called on China to actively serve 
as a mediator in the issue of DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected 
nuclear arms development, he failed to get a satisfactory 
reaction from Li, as the SDPJ delegation did last year. On the 
contrary, Li admonished Kubo, stating that "putting pressure 
will heighten the tension." It seems that Kubo -- who 
persistently maintained the need "to cooperate with China" in 
dealing with the North Korea issue in previous policy 
consultations of the ruling coalition -- was disappointed with 
China's reaction.

<F P=106> [By Yoshihito Horie] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun -- According to a Chinese diplomatic 
source, Premier Li Peng may visit three West European countries, 
including Germany and France, as early as July. This will be 
the first time that Li Peng -- the person responsible for the 
suppression of the democratic movement during the Tiananmen 
incident in 1989 -- will have visited the advanced industrial 
countries since the incident. 
  As the United States has decided to renew 
most-favored-nation 
treatment for China, and to discontinue linking renewal to human 
rights issues, the visit is meant to demonstrate China's 
complete rehabilitation in the international community five 
years after Tiananmen. Backed by rapid economic growth, the PRC 
is expected to engage in active, omnidirectional diplomacy from 
now on. 
  Advanced Western nations have had an aversion to visits by 
top Chinese leaders, especially Li Peng, who is particularly 
loathed by pro-democracy forces, since sanctions were imposed on 
the PRC following the Tiananmen incident. It was Li who 
declared martial law in Beijing. 
  Li's trip will return the visits made to Beijing by German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in November 1993, and French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur in April. He is expected to propose 
further expansion of cooperative relations, particularly in 
economics and trade. 
  Japan also invited Li Peng to visit when former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was in China in March. 
  Factors contributing to China's rehabilitation in the 
international community include its good record in economic 
development, compared to Western economies which have suffered 
from a recession, an improvement in the PRC's position as a 
major power in Asia and the Pacific region, and chaos in 
democratized Russia and eastern Europe. 
  The Chinese source said: "Helped by a favorable atmosphere, 
the wounds left by the incident have been healed over five 
years." 
  One of the outstanding characteristics of China's recent 
diplomatic strategy is that it gives central importance to 
establishing friendly ties with neighboring countries. China, 
which became isolated following the Tiananmen incident, first 
tried to cement relations with Japan and other neighboring 
countries, and subsequently started to move toward improving 
relations with the advanced nations. 
  In the case of the United States, China applied pressure by 
actively improving relations with its economic rival, Japan, and 
its political archenemy, Russia. 
  China calls its strategy "yuanjiao jinhe [close ties with 
faraway countries and peace with neighboring countries]," taking 
and adapting a leaf from the Warring States period [475-221 
B.C.] strategy of "yuanjiao jingong [close ties with faraway 
countries; invade nearby countries]." Furthermore, it tries to 
play the advanced nations one against another as they attempt to 
make economic inroads into China. 
  Among China's neighbors, the PRC places emphasis on Japan, 
Russia and ASEAN. China is sending Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
to the regional forum scheduled to be held in Bangkok in July 
because it attaches great importance to this first opportunity 
for China to discuss politics and security in Asia and the 
Pacific. 
  Southeast Asia has lingering fears of China caused by its 
military modernization efforts, the territorial dispute over the 
Spratlys, and its economic successes. The PRC will explain its 
position candidly at the forum and attempt to seek the 
understanding of Southeast Asia to make the gathering a 
"conference at which anxieties are removed" in volatile 
post-Cold War Asia.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 April (MTI) -- A senior official at the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry, anonymously told MTI's Beijing 
correspondent that he saw no reason for the expansion of NATO, 
now the Warsaw Pact organization has broken up. 
  The official made the remark in answer to a question on the 
Chinese Government position on the integration of Hungary and 
other Central European countries into NATO, and a possible 
eastward expansion of the North-Atlantic organization. 
  This was the first time that a senior Chinese source had 
taken a stand on the issue. 
  At a press conference held in Beijing for Central and 
Eastern 
European correspondents, the same senior official said China 
understood Hungary's desire to become a full member of the 
European Union and this way strengthen its links with other 
European states. 
  However, the Chinese Government hopes Hungary will not 
forget 
about its eastern links while integrating into Europe, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, 31 May -- Commenting on information that 
China is preparing to conduct a nuclear test, an informed source 
in Beijing said on 31 May, "It is highly possible that China 
will conduct the nuclear test during June, and its scale would 
be larger than the nuclear test that China carried out last 
October." It is believed that with the Clinton administration 
having renewed most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status for China, 
which had been an issue pending between the United States and 
China, the Chinese Government has decided to resume nuclear 
testing.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun -- A Chinese source has disclosed 
that, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen 
incident, the CPC issued in mid-May an internal notice for 
cadres with instructions that every effort should be made to 
maintain stability in their own respective units. 
  A strong dissatisfaction against society has been noted 
among 
those on low incomes such as workers at state-run enterprises 
and peasants. This feeling has been considerably intensified 
because of the growing disparity in incomes, inflation, and 
corruption among cadres. 
  It is reported that while the notice frankly admits the 
situation exists, it also points out that "all cadres should try 
to understand the issue correctly, and at the same time be 
confident it will be eventually settled by the party." 
  In this way, the CPC has once again called on its cadres to 
trust the party. The notice can be said to indicate the current 
situation in which the sense of crisis within the party has been 
intensified by factors such as disparity in income, inflation, 
and corruption, which have caused social instability and now 
apply strong pressure on the party.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 May -- A reliable Chinese source 
disclosed on 16 May that Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount 
leader, has recently criticized President Jiang Zemin by name 
for "being bent on forming a faction in an attempt to solidify 
his power base." Until now Deng has backed Jiang as his 
successor to lead the collective leadership of China. President 
Jiang, however, has taken a conspicuously tough stance and has 
abandoned his conventional moderate attitude. Deng's response 
has been to "rebuke" President Jiang out of fear that his change 
of attitude could lead to a split in the CPC. 
  It remains unclear when Deng issued his criticism of 
President Jiang, but the same source said Deng's accusation was 
that President Jiang was trying to form a "new Shanghai group." 
Early last year President Jiang appointed Ba Zhongtan, one of 
his confidantes, as commander of the armed police force. In 
response, Deng said: "Efforts should have been made to look for 
capable persons among the whole nation, without any attempt to 
build factions," adding that he had not been briefed in advance 
on the recent shakeup of the military and the police. 
  President Jiang visited Shanghai for 11 days beginning 26 
April. According to the same Chinese source, Jiang visited the 
city with the aim of solidifying his power base. 
  President Jiang served as mayor and secretary of Shanghai 
city from 1985 to 1988 and Ba served as commander of the 
Shanghai Garrison during that period. Deng named Jiang as 
general secretary of the CPC after General Secretary Zhao Ziyang 
was ousted from power in the wake of the Tiananmen incident. 
Deng gave Jiang the post of chairman of the CPC Central 
Military Commission despite his lack of military experience. 
Jiang became president last March. Deng is believed to have 
approved of Jiang's rise in party and government ranks after 
concluding that, as a moderate, Jiang was the best qualified to 
lead the Chinese collective leadership in the post-Deng era. 
  President Jiang has become so powerful that he has exercised 
his influence over the military and police shakeup. Deng told a 
March session of the National People's Congress: "We should not 
fear hyper growth." 
  In contrast, President Jiang and Premier Li Peng, a 
conservative, insisted on curbing growth at 9 percent.

  [Text] In an interview with an ASAHI SHIMBUN correspondent 
at a hotel near Narita Air Port on 14 April, the Dalai Lama, 58, 
a paramount Tibetan religious and political leader, stated: 
"China has trampled human rights in Tibet. I hope Japan and 
other nations will put pressure on China to halt the 
infringement of human rights in Tibet." The Tibetan religions 
leader granted the interview during his brief half-day stopover 
in Japan on his way to the United States for a meeting with 
American scientists. 
  In the interview, the Dalai Lama stressed there is no change 
in his position stressed in the 1988 Strasburg proposal that he 
does not seek complete the independence of Tibet, and will allow 
China to retain its power to handle Tibet's foreign and defense 
policies. In the interview, he candidly admitted that the 
Chinese Government has yet to make any positive response to his 
proposal. 
  Asked who will succeed the Panchen Lama, the Buddhist leader 
in Tibet who ranks 2nd only to the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan 
Buddhist hierarchy, the Tibetan religious leader said he has a 
list of candidates compiled by China and which contains five 
candidates. During the interview, he disclosed that he asked the 
Chinese Government to choose a successor to the Panchen Lama 
based on traditional methods, not on political reasons. He also 
proposed sending a survey team to that end, but the Chinese 
Government has rejected his request.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wang Dan, former student movement leader in </F>
the Tiananmen incident, by MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter Koji 
Kamimura in Beijing; date not given; first paragraph is 
Kamimura's introduction] 
  [Text] Former Beijing University student Wang Dan (age: 
25), who is known as a leader of student movement in the 
Tiananmen incident, has given an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
in Beijing. Commenting on the democratic movement five years 
ago, Wang said: "I think it had a positive meaning." However, 
he pointed out that a drastic change took place in the Chinese 
society after the incident, saying: "People's interests are 
currently more concentrated on economic affairs (than political 
affairs)." With regard to future development in the Chinese 
situation, which is currently faced with inflation and other 
serious problems, Wang said: "There are many unpredictable 
factors." 
  [Kamimura] What do you think about the situation in the last 
five years? 
  [Wang] It has obviously changed. While becoming less 
conscious than before about profits for the society and the 
state, everyone is now interested in profits of their own. 
People have become eager to make money because they obtained 
financial profits thanks to the economic growth. But I believe, 
if the economy develops to a certain level, people would be 
again interested in political affairs. 
  [Kamimura] Five years ago, students and intellectual people 
rose against high commodity prices and frequent corruption 
cases. What is going on now? 
  [Wang] Presently, workers and farmers are having 
difficulties in making their livelihood. They are seriously 
suffering from inflation. If the government fails to properly 
handle economic policies, their frustration may come to surface. 
  [Kamimura] What do you think of the significance of the 
Tiananmen incident? 
  [Wang] People were enthusiastic for the democratic movement, 
and they place great hopes on it. I think the incident had great 
significance. However, we were quite premature at that time. 
We thought in simple way, and took actions from sincere 
motivation without using political maneuvers. As a result, the 
Tiananmen incident resulted in a tragic ending, and many people 
were killed in the incident. 
  [Kamimura] How did the authorities treat you after your 
arrest? 
  [Wang] They did not beat or curse me. In my case, they 
respected my personality. 
  [Kamimura] Do you keep contact with your friends who have 
escaped overseas, such as Chai Ling and Wuer Kaixi? 
  [Wang] They often telephone me. I told them I am doing 
nothing except for some reading and writing. I am now 
interested in the modern history after the establishment of the 
country (in 1949), and read books in this field. 
  [Kamimura] What will happen to China hereafter? 
  [Wang] Drastic changes will take place in the economic 
situation and the political situation within five to 10 years. 
Ideally speaking, democratic policies should be implemented in 
China step by step. However, the Chinese social situation is 
not very simple. There always are undeniable possibilities of 
sudden changes.
