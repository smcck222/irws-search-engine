<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Shichang (0151 0013 2490): "Liaoning's </F>
Overall Economic Operation is Good, Some Conspicuous Problems 
Need Serious Attention"] 
  [Text] Li Gejun, deputy director of the provincial planning 
and economic commission, gave a report to the press on 24 May on 
the provincial economic situation. He held: Liaoning's economy 
has developed continuously, speedily, and healthily since the 
beginning of this year, and the general situation is good. 
However, there are some conspicuous problems in the economic 
operation, especially the problems of the small increase in the 
production of state-owned enterprises, the low overall economic 
efficiency, and the increase in the enterprises that incur 
losses. We should now correctly handle the relations between 
development, reform, and stability. 
  When talking about the basic situation in the current 
economic operation in Liaoning, Li Gejun first introduced the 
good aspects. First, spring plowing has proceeded smoothly; 
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery are 
brisk; and township enterprises continue to develop vigorously. 
Second, state-owned enterprises have registered a fairly large 
increase, and nonstate-owned enterprises have continued the high 
growth rate. In the first four months of this year, state-owned 
enterprises in the province achieved an output value of 38.19 
billion yuan, up 4.1 percent from the corresponding period of 
last year; and nonstate-owned enterprises achieved an output 
value of 61.47 billion yuan, up 56.62 percent. Third, the 
increase of fixed asset investment and the number of newly 
started projects have been brought under control to a certain 
extent. Fourth, market purchases and sales are stable, and the 
chaos in commodity prices took a favorable turn. Fifth, the 
export of local products has grown continuously, and the amount 
of foreign funds actually used has increased. Sixth, the 
increase volume of bank deposits outstripped that of loans, and 
people's savings grew substantially, with the increase volume 
10.66 billion yuan higher than that of the corresponding period 
of last year. Seventh, the transition to the new tax system has 
been stable, and revenue and expenditure have basically been 
normal. According to the new tax distribution system, the local 
financial revenue of Liaoning reached 3.207 billion yuan in the 
January-April period, up 17.4 percent from the corresponding 
period last year in terms of comparable standards. 
  In analyzing Liaoning's conspicuous problems in the economic 
operation, Li Gejun emphatically pointed out: The production of 
state-owned enterprises increased fairly little, and their 
overall economic efficiency was not high. In the first four 
months of this year, Liaoning's budgetary state-owned industrial 
enterprises created 1.825 billion yuan in profits and taxes, 
down 38.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year. 
Enterprises which incurred losses outnumbered the figure 
registered in the corresponding period last year by 275, and 
66.1 percent of the enterprises suffered losses. Both the 
number of enterprises that incurred losses and the amount of 
deficits increased by a large margin as compared with last year. 
In the first quarter of this year, 447, or 12 percent, of 
Liaoning's state-owned industrial enterprises stopped production 
totally or partly, and 275,000 staff members and workers were 
involved. 
  One of the factors that contributed to the rise of the 
losses 
of the state-owned enterprises was the fairly conspicuous 
contradiction in the shortage of funds, the unsmooth circulation 
of enterprise capital, the irrational structure of the funds 
that are tied up, the low efficiency in the use of funds, and 
serious mutual arrears among enterprises. In addition, the 
implementation of the new tax system has reduced the amount of 
the capital that enterprises can use. 
  Another conspicuous problem in Liaoning's economic operation 
is the large commodity price increases. Li Gejun held: The 
current situation in commodity prices is very grim. After 
increasing by 13.5 percent last year, Liaoning's retail price 
index has continued to climb this year, rising by 19 percent in 
average. Now the price rises have slowed down. 
  To effectively check price rises, Li Gejun held: Governments 
at all levels and every department concerned should continue 
their good job in monitoring, supervising, and inspecting 
prices. Since late last year when the system of reporting the 
main foodstuff prices every three days took effect, more than 
2,000 cases violating the law on prices have been investigated 
and handled. The departments concerned in Liaoning are 
exercising administrative means to determine the price ceilings 
for grain and edible oil. Economic means have been exercised by 
12 cities and 21 counties to establish price adjusting funds for 
nonstaple foodstuff in order to stabilize market commodity 
prices. 
  After analyzing Liaoning's economic situation, Li Gejun 
pointed out: Some contradictions and problems have been 
alleviated to different degrees, but to resolve the 
contradictions in the structure and mechanism which have formed 
for a long time needs a pretty long process. The key is to 
correctly handle the relations between development, reform, and 
stability, to grasp the opportunity, to speed up development, to 
better the regulation and control over economic operation, and 
to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development in Liaoning. 
  Zhao Xinliang, director of the provincial planning 
commission, stated that reports on the economic situation in the 
entire province would be held often in the future to increase 
the transparency of Liaoning's economic operation through the 
press.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Jiang Zemin at the Central Military </F>
Commission's rank-conferring ceremony in Beijing on 8 June] 
  [Text] Comrades: A Central Military Commission [CMC] 
decree has just been announced to confer a new military rank on 
Xu Huizi and 18 other comrades, promoting them to the rank of 
general. On behalf of the party Central Committee, State 
Council, and CMC I would like to warmly congratulate the 
comrades who have been promoted to the rank of general. 
  The promotion of these comrades to the rank of general once 
again demonstrates the great importance placed by the party and 
state on army building, and reflects the CMC's great trust and 
deep concern. It is hoped the comrades who have been promoted in 
rank will highly cherish the great honor bestowed upon them by 
the party and people, recognize the heavy responsibility they 
are shouldering, do honor to their mission, justify the great 
trust placed in them, learn modestly, work hard, and make new 
contributions to strengthening our army's revolutionization, 
modernization, and regularization. 
  Since the 14th National CPC Congress, the CMC has 
strengthened strategic guidance over national defense and army 
building; vigorously promoted our army's fine tradition; further 
intensified efforts to build up leadership bodies and cadre 
ranks; and carried out a variety of tasks related to military 
and political affairs, logistics, defense-related scientific 
research, equipment upgrading, and the buildup of reserve forces 
under the guiding principles of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas 
for army building during the new period. It has brought about 
new improvements in the army's rallying power and combat 
effectiveness, made substantial progress in army building, and 
successfully completed the various tasks assigned by the party 
and state. 
  Our country's socialist modernization drive is currently in 
a 
crucial period. Seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open 
wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain 
stability is in the general interest of party-wide work. 
Realizing and maintaining this general interest is inevitably 
required for upholding the party's basic line, with the goal of 
ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our 
national economy, as well as the all-around advancement and 
ultimate success of the cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The entire party and army, as well as people 
across the country, should conscientiously safeguard, defer to, 
and promote this general interest. During the entire 
modernization process, we must properly handle the relationship 
among reform, development, and stability, making every effort to 
advance reform and development amid stability and to ensure 
long-term social stability through reform and development. A 
strong army and strong national defense always provide powerful 
support for reform, opening up, and modernization, as well as a 
reliable guarantee for consolidating state power, promoting 
social stability and economic development, and bringing the 
people peace. Comrades throughout the army should fully 
recognize the heavy responsibility shouldered by our army, defer 
to and serve the general interest of party-wide work in 
everything they do, prepare themselves for danger in times of 
peace, be always on the alert, make every effort to improve army 
building, and make even greater contributions to promoting 
reform and development, safeguarding the motherland's security 
and unity, and maintaining social stability and unity. 
  Senior cadres in our army are the backbone of military 
administration. The party Central Committee and CMC's strategic 
intentions should first be carried out through senior cadres. 
Now the party Central Committee has laid down its major 
policies and principles, and the CMC has provided clear-cut work 
guidance, the important thing is to carry them out. Leading 
cadres at all levels must earnestly practice what they advocate. 
More important, senior cadres should pay close attention to 
political studies; heighten the concept of party spirit; 
resolutely follow the party's instructions; steadfastly 
implement the party's line, principles, and policies; firmly 
follow the party Central Committee and CMC's command; faithfully 
and assiduously work for the party and people with a keen sense 
of dedication and responsibility; and splendidly accomplish the 
chief mission assigned to them by history. 
  As early as when the entire party shifted the focus of its 
work to socialist modernization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping noted 
explicitly: "The entire party must learn anew." He said: "Our 
party, CPC members, and the Chinese people should always learn 
in the face of an endless stream of new problems." Because of 
the swift progress in our national construction and army 
building, new contradictions, problems, expertise, and 
experiences have come to the fore in an endless stream, and we 
should doubly stress learning, investigation, and study. With a 
clear theoretical understanding and a firm theoretical basis, we 
can implement the party's line, principles, and policies more 
conscientiously. For senior army cadres to intensify their 
learning and studies is not only important for their own 
progress and improvement but also for long-term army building. 
Keeping reality in mind, senior cadres throughout the army must 
conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as his ideas for 
army building during the new period. They should gain a 
profound understanding of the quintessence of emancipating the 
mind and seeking truth from facts; work hard to study and master 
the scientific world outlook and methodology on dialectical and 
historical materialism that pervade Comrade Xiaoping's works; 
and strive to inherit and improve upon Mao Zedong's military 
thought. They should pay attention to acquiring modern 
scientific and technological know-how, study strategies and 
tactics for waging a people's war in a high-technology setting, 
and master the skills of commanding modern warfare. Through 
learning, they should improve their theoretical knowledge of 
Marxism, strengthen their political conviction in socialism, 
conscientiously remold their world outlook, actively improve 
their leadership style and methods, and continue to improve 
their leadership standards and commanding skills. In short, 
every senior cadre should learn, and learn anew, in real earnest. 
  We should take the lead in promoting an arduous pioneering 
spirit and the fine work style of maintaining close ties with 
the masses. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a 
completely new cause that has never been tried before. To put 
the state and army's great pioneering work into practice, it is 
imperative that we carry forward the tradition of Red Army 
veterans, promote the "five types of revolutionary spirit" 
[revolutionary and death-defying spirit; spirit of observing 
strict discipline and sacrificing oneself; spirit of 
selflessness and placing other people's interests above one's 
own; spirit of defeating all enemies and overcoming all 
difficulties; and spirit of scoring victory by maintaining 
revolutionary optimism and surmounting all difficulties -- from 
speech by Deng Xiaoping at a CPC Central Committee work 
conference on 25 December 1980] initiated by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, always maintain our flesh-and-blood ties with people, 
and make concerted efforts to keep advancing our cause. Senior 
cadres throughout the army must always serve the people 
wholeheartedly, earnestly work for people's interests, wage 
arduous struggles, honestly perform their official duties, and 
take a modest, prudent, and realistic approach. They must 
project this good image when they appear before the broad ranks 
of cadres and fighters, and when they conduct themselves in 
society. This is a question of great importance to troop morale 
and the army's high prestige. They should keep in mind our 
army's character and goal at all times, not pursue personal fame 
and wealth, give no thought to personal gain or loss, and devote 
all their energy and attention to the party and army's cause. 
They should exercise their power correctly, readily accept 
supervision by party organizations and people, closely guard 
against the corrosion of debauchery, prevent the practice of 
trading power for money, and always maintain the sterling 
qualities of CPC members and revolutionary armymen. They should 
heed cadres and fighters' voices, keep people's well-being in 
mind despite their high positions, think of ways to solve the 
practical problems of grass-roots units, and stay in touch with 
people at all times. They should go deep into the realities of 
life, go down to grass-roots units, throw themselves into 
practical work, and guard against empty talk and formalism. 
Through the exemplary conduct of senior cadres, we should carry 
forward and improve upon our party and army's fine tradition and 
work style in the new situation. In building up leadership 
bodies, we should earnestly groom and select prominent young 
cadres who are both professionally competent and politically 
reliable, advance the cause of introducing younger leadership 
bodies, and place old, middle-aged, and young people in 
leadership positions in a step-by-step manner to facilitate the 
maturity of an endless stream of new people. This is an urgent 
task in army building. Senior cadres should bear the solemn 
responsibility for grooming and selecting prominent young 
cadres. The cadres we select must be true communists, show a 
spirit of dedication to the cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and be able to inherit the heroic 
spirit of veteran comrades in following the direction of 
revolutionary struggle. We should carry out education in this 
respect, impart our experiences, and help and set an example for 
new hands so that there will be no lack of successors to our 
cause, and so that our party and army's fine tradition will be 
passed from generation to generation. 
  We should administer the army strictly. This is an 
important thought consistently emphasized by Comrades Mao Zedong 
and Deng Xiaoping. Strict military administration is not only 
an important principle governing army building but also an 
inevitable path for strengthening all facets of army building. 
Only strictness can guarantee discipline, orderliness, unity, 
and combat effectiveness. This people's army of ours has always 
been known for its close-knit organization and strict 
discipline. This is an important cause of our army's strong 
rallying power and combat effectiveness. To administer the army 
strictly, we should, first and foremost, adopt a strict approach 
toward senior cadres. Senior cadres should serve as models in 
following commands, in strictly observing discipline, and in 
rigorously enforcing rules and regulations. They should 
implement the policy decisions, decrees, and directives of the 
party Central Committee and CMC to the letter in order to ensure 
that government and military decrees will be relayed to relevant 
units without obstruction. They should enforce military 
discipline strictly, mete out rewards and punishment strictly 
and impartially, administer troops rigorously, and earnestly set 
standards for troop behavior in accordance with rules and 
regulations. They should improve troop education and training 
while bearing in mind the need for a high degree of difficulty, 
rigorousness, and actual combat. They should strengthen all 
aspects of army building at the grass-roots level and earnestly 
lay a solid foundation for troops in accordance with the demands 
of the "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level." 
They should make unremitting efforts to improve the army's work 
style and tighten troop discipline, strengthen regular 
ideological and administrative work, devote great efforts to 
improving the commanding skills of grass-roots cadres, and 
enhance unity between officers and men. They should further 
improve "double-support" work [support the army and give 
preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary armymen 
and martyrs, support the government and cherish the people], 
actively launch activities to promote socialist spiritual 
civilization through joint army-civilian efforts, and enhance 
the army's unity with the government and people. Our army must 
maintain a good image in all sectors of society as reflected by 
its observance of disciplinary rules and laws, neat appearance, 
and strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. It should 
become an awe-inspiring and culturally advanced army which 
enjoys the people's love and esteem. Through rigorous training, 
strict administration, and in-depth and meticulous ideological 
and political work, we should maintain the high degree of 
stability and unified centralism in the army; truly achieve 
political soundness, military proficiency, a fine work style, 
strict discipline, and effective logistics support; and 
constantly improve combat effectiveness. 
  Comrades: At present, the overall situation in our country 
is very good as far as reform, opening up, and modernization are 
concerned. We are full of confidence. At the same time, we 
should be aware that we will face a considerable number of new 
contradictions and problems in the course of progress, and we 
cannot afford to slacken our efforts in the slightest degree. 
We must redouble our efforts to convert the policy decisions of 
the party Central Committee and CMC into conscientious actions 
by officers and men throughout the army. The party and people 
have assigned the important task of commanding troops to our 
senior cadres at this historical moment. I believe that you 
will surely be able to shoulder this heavy historical 
responsibility; strive to make the country strong; keep blazing 
new trails and forging ahead; build the people's army under the 
party's absolute leadership into an even better one; and 
unflinchingly achieve the grand goal set by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping of building a strong, modern, and regular revolutionary 
army.

  [Text] Beijing, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin today called on senior army officers to conscientiously 
study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and Deng's ideas on army construction during the 
present new period. 
  At a ceremony promoting 19 senior officers to generals, 
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, 
emphasized the importance of integrating Deng's theory and ideas 
with practice. 
  He said: "We must pay close attention to the study of modern 
science, technology and expertise, and study strategies and 
tactics of the people's war in high-tech conditions, in order to 
master the capabilities needed to direct modern warfare." 
  The leader stressed that senior officers must study hard, 
unswervingly implement the line and policies of the Chinese 
Communist Party and firmly follow the instructions of the party 
Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. 
  Jiang described a powerful army and strong national defense 
as a "powerful backing" for reforms, opening up to the world and 
the modernization drive, and as a "reliable guarantee" for the 
consolidation of state power, social stability, economic growth 
and a peaceful life. 
  He said that officers and men of the People's Liberation 
Army 
(PLA), China's armed forces, must be vigilant in peace-time and 
be well prepared at all times so as to make even greater 
contributions to China's security, unification, stability and 
unity. 
  He asked senior officers to serve the people wholeheartedly, 
sincerely bring happiness to the people, work hard in the 
interests of the people, and to be honest. 
  The PLA is best known for being well-organized and strictly 
observing discipline, said Jiang, general secretary of the party 
Central Committee. 
  For this reason, senior officers must set an example in 
observing discipline and implementing rules and regulations, he 
said. 
  They must also implement to the letter the decisions, orders 
and directives of the party Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission, he added.

<F P=106> [Report by Yin Wu (3009 0702) and reporter Yang Yuchen (2799 </F>
3768 6591): "Army Staff Officers College Succeeds in 
Manufacturing Automatic Field Operations Command System"] 
  [Text] The history of staff officers participating in 
making plans and devising strategies for operations by manual 
use a map, a pen, and a watch is over in the Army Staff Officers 
College. In mid-May, the automatic field operations command 
system developed by this college was officially put into use in 
teaching. This reporter saw a gratifying scene in the college's 
basic staff training course classroom: More than 70 students 
had finished drawing up operational plans and plotting tactical 
charts with the application of computers, and their dream of 
creating a device with reading, memorizing, calculating, 
writing, drawing, and transmitting capacities had come true. 
  For many years the above six commanding capacities have been 
manually operated in a traditional pattern and have been 
"bottlenecks" affecting and restricting enhancement of command 
functions due to low speed and efficiency. For this reason, the 
Army Staff Officers College enlisted forces to tackle the key 
problems and, after several years of hard work, succeeded in 
developing this system, thus enabling the army to achieve the 
objective of automatically handling the operational work of 
staff officers. 
  Ma Kaicheng, an associate professor who is the principal 
person in charge of this project, briefed this reporter, saying: 
In using this system for "reading," instead of applying such 
instruments as maps, magnetic needles, rulers, and so on, we 
only have to strike the keys on the keyboard. The computer will 
analyze various topographic elements. It will then display on 
the screen the general configuration of the surface of the 
battlefield in three dimensions with various angles and 
altitudes, automatically showing on the map the measurement and 
judgment of distance and area. In addition, in light of the 
tactical background, the computer will produce specific charts 
for parachute landing and traversing the area. The data base 
of the system has a storing capacity of several hundred thousand 
characters and over 100,000 items of classified data, which are 
accurate and reliable and can be consulted at any moment. In 
this way, it has changed the traditional function of "memory." 
As to "calculation," the system can work out, among other 
things, troop maneuvers, operational commands, and combat 
capacity. Besides, in light of the strength, weaponry, 
quantity, and quality of both our and enemy forces, it can also 
give overall consideration to various factors including 
environment, operations, combat actions, and so on to foresee 
victory, defeat, advance, retreat, and exhaustion in a campaign, 
so that decisions of the commanders will be more scientific. In 
terms of "writing," by conducting dialogue between computer and 
operator, the system can automatically draw up various operation 
orders, instructions, and plans, and, the moment a commander 
makes up his mind, draft a combat order. For "transmission," 
the system can automatically encipher and instantly transmit 
messages with text as excellent as the accompanying pictures. 
  This reporter has noted that the system works on a 
microcomputer which is just the size of a notebook. The success 
of developing this device has blazed a new trail for the highly 
efficient command of the headquarters in field operations. It 
marks that our army has scaled a new height in automated 
command. After watching the demonstration, leading cadres 
including Zhang Wannian, Fu Quanyou, and others spoke highly of 
the system, which, in the headquarters' view, represents the 
reform orientation of command pattern of the headquarters.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Xiaoqing [0491 1420 7230]] </F>
  [Text] Chongqing, 29 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--With the 
efforts made in the past dozen of years, the war industry in 
southwest China has basically shifted production to turning out 
civilian products. Last year, the output value of civilian 
products turned out by the war industry in the southwest reached 
over 8 billion yuan, accounting for more than 90 percent of the 
total output value of the industry. 
  The war industry in the southwest is an important part of 
the 
war industry in China. The industry consists of over 50 
enterprises, research institutes, institutions of higher 
learning, and schools. It employs 250,000 staff members and 
workers and has fixed assets amounting to over 4 billion yuan. 
In the 1950's and 1960's, the war industry of the southwest 
mainly produced military products and occupied a decisive 
position in the war industry of China. 
  The war industry of the southwest began its strategic shift 
to the production of civilian products at the beginning of the 
1980's. This production has been expanding year after year and 
at present, its scale is considerable. It now turns out more 
than 10 categories of major products including mini-cars, 
motorcycles, heavy-duty trucks, machines for oil production, 
optical and electrical instruments, refrigerators, and cameras. 
It has formed a production set up in which the production of 
cars occupies a dominant position. By the end of 1993, the 
southwest war industry had produced an accumulated total of over 
5 million motorcycles, over 140,000 mini- cars, 800,000 cameras, 
and nearly 500,000 refrigerators. Ninety percent of its 
enterprises have their own leading civilian products. 
  Since it began its shift to the production of civilian 
products, the southwest war industry has established ties of 
cooperation with over 500 civilian product enterprises and over 
300 rural enterprises in China. It has also strengthened its 
cooperation with foreign countries and has imported a lot of 
advanced technology and equipment from abroad. More than 20 of 
its major projects have advanced technology and production lines 
imported from foreign countries for turning out civilian 
products. To date, the southwest war industry has over 50 
Sino-foreign joint ventures for turning out civilian products 
and agreements signed by these joint ventures involve investment 
amounting to a total of over $1.5 billion. The export of 
civilian products by the southwest war industry has exceeded 1 
billion yuan. 
  It is learned from the Southwest Company that by the end of 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan, both the output value and sales 
volume of civilian products turned out by the southwest war 
industry will reach 10 billion yuan. The company will use 
various channels to introduce foreign capital to develop the 
production of civilian products and is ready to make investments 
and set up factories abroad.

  [Text] The provincial forum on enterprise ideological and 
political work, jointly sponsored by the provincial party 
committee's propaganda department and the provincial financial 
and economic commission and lasted for two and a half days, 
closed in Xining on 2 June. Forum participants exchanged 
experiences in doing a good job of enterprise ideological and 
political work in the new period and discussed and studied the 
question of how to strengthen and improve enterprise ideological 
and political work while establishing a socialist market 
economic structure. During the forum, Yin Kesheng, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, and Wang Hanmin, Standing 
Committee member of the provincial party committee and vice 
governor, spoke. 
  Yi Kesheng pointed out: Ideological and political work is 
our party's fine tradition. In carrying out the drive for 
reform and opening up to the outside world and developing the 
market economy, we should vigorously propagate the party's line, 
principles, and policies, enhance the consciousness of 
enterprise staff members and workers and their willingness to 
get involved in reform and working for development rather than 
relax our efforts or weakening ideological and political work in 
the slightest degree. At the same time, those doing ideological 
and political work should be good at summing up advanced ideas 
and deeds among the masses of people and give them wide 
publicity so that they will become powerful driving forces. 
  In his speech, Wang Hanmin said: Current enterprise 
ideological and political work confronts new developments and 
problems. There have been complexity and liveliness in real 
work and ideological conceptions. Under these circumstances, 
party committees at all levels and enterprise leading comrades 
should have a full understanding of the urgency and arduousness 
of strengthening and improving ideological and political work at 
present. In practical work, on the one hand, they should 
develop the spirit of pressing forward in the face of 
difficulties and working with perseverance and unswervingly push 
reform ahead; on the other hand, they should foster a rigorous 
and ample scientific approach, promptly solve problems, and try 
their best to put an end to the situation in which those doing 
ideological and political work are lacking in initiative and 
overcautious and take an inactive and wait-and-see attitude. 
Party and government organizations, trade unions, and the 
Chinese Youth League organizations in enterprises should work 
together, heighten their fighting spirit, carry out enterprise 
ideological and political work in a down-to-earth manner, and 
contribute to the continuous deepening of reform, economic 
development, and social stability. 
  Also present at the forum were Xiao Xiangcheng, member of 
the 
provincial party Standing Committee member; Wang Enke, vice 
chairman of the Standing Committee of the provincial people 
congress; and Ma Tingxiao, vice chairman of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference. 
  Tian Yuan, director of the provincial party committee's 
propaganda department, and department deputy director Luo 
Chengyuan also spoke at the forum.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Xian, Chan Wai-fong and agencies] </F>
  [Excerpts] More than 100 officials and staff of the China 
Northwest Airlines last night turned Xian's Feitian Hotel into a 
reception centre for relatives and friends of the 160 victims of 
China's worst reported air crash on Monday [6 June]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Before they left Kai Tak [Hong Kong's airport] yesterday, 
they complained that Chinese authorities had delayed telling 
them about the tragedy, in which 10 other foreigners were 
killed. They said they would be demanding "due compensation" 
for the whole incident. Northwest offered each family US$5,000 
(about HK$38,600) to cover the cost of their trip to Xian. 
  Relatives were holding meetings in their hotels early this 
morning to decide what demands they would make for visiting the 
site and claiming the bodies. "They haven't told us anything 
yet, I just have to wait," said a Chinese woman from Beijing, 
whose business colleague was killed when the Tupolev 154 crashed 
soon after take-off from Xian on a regular flight to Guangzhou. 
[passage omitted] 
  A spokesman for the Government of Shaanxi province said the 
two explosions had been caused by the "breakup of the flight 
deck" but denied there had been a fire. 
  An airline spokesman said the pilot had not made a mistake. 
He said that just before the disaster, the pilot, in his 
mid-40s and with 20 years of flying experience, had shouted that 
he was losing control. "The plane was shaking as if from 
violent turbulence -- listing at an angle of first 20, then 30, 
then 40 degrees. Radar equipment had broken down," the 
spokesman said. "The pilot could not hear the control tower, 
though the control tower could hear him. He said he would take 
the plane in for landing. Then the control tower lost 
communications." 
  At the crash scene in the village of Mingdu, 30 km southeast 
of Xian, three parts of a plane were clearly visible from 
outside the barrier set up by security officials. The nose of 
the plane could be seen lying flat in the gold-coloured wheat 
fields that surround the small village. About one km away, the 
plane's large white tail was stuck into the ground like the end 
of a dart. [passage omitted] 
  A China Northwest spokesman said the airline was debating 
whether to ground the remainder of its TU-154s for safety 
checks. The airline operates more TU-154s than it does any 
other plane. A Russian aviation source quoted by the ITAR-TASS 
news agency said China had taken delivery of the jet in December 
1986 and that it had been given a scheduled repair in 1992.

  [Text] Xian--The head of China Northwest Airlines, the 
operator of the Tupolev-154 jetliner that crashed on Monday near 
Xian killing all 160 people aboard, ruled out a quick 
explanation of the country's worst air mishap, citing a lack of 
information at this stage. 
  Gao Junyue, general manager of the airline, said it was 
impossible to figure out the cause of the accident before all 
the data in the black box flight recorder, which was found 
largely intact at the crash site, was analyzed. This could not 
be completed in just a few days. 
  Gao said the Russian producer of the Tupolev-154 jet will 
send investigators to China soon, at the invitation of the 
Chinese Government. 
  The general manager said the airline will compensate each 
domestic victim 70,000 yuan ($8,090), as stipulated by a 1993 
regulation issued by the State Council. Families of victims 
from outside the Chinese mainland will receive $40,000. 
  The People's Insurance Company of China will pay another 
100,000 yuan ($11,500) to each victim who had bought insurance 
from them before boarding the flight. It was not known how many 
of them had done so. 
  Gao said the crew reported, just two minutes after the 
plane's 8:12 am take-off from Xian to Guangzhou, that the plane 
was swaying uncontrollably. At 8:19, the crew said the shaking 
became more violent at an altitude of 3,600 m and they demanded 
to return to the airport. The authorities granted their request 
and opened the runway and nearby airports for a possible 
emergency landing. 
  Gao said witnesses reported one or two thunder-like 
explosions in the clouds and saw the plane hitting the ground in 
three large pieces: The nose, part of the fuselage and the 
tail. Debris was later found scattered across a 2-square-km 
area. 
  He said it was the first time in China's aviation history 
that a passenger airliner had blown up in midair. 
  Gao said the plane underwent a major overhaul in 1992 and 
had 
flown 2,857 hours since then. It had flown a total of 10,000 
hours. The Russian producer said the plane was considered to be 
still new, as it was designed to fly 30,000 hours. 
  On June 3, the plane was reported to have some malfunctions. 
It was soon repaired and was determined in test flying to be 
satisfactory. Monday's fatal trip was its first formal flight 
since then. 
  Gao said the unidentified foreign passenger on Monday was an 
Australian instead of a Swiss as previously reported.

  [Text] Taipei, June 8 (CNA) -- South Africa is not 
expected to cut its longstanding diplomatic ties with the 
Republic of China [ROC], the ROC ambassador to that country said 
Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Ambassador Lu said South African President Nelson 
Mandela personally assured President Li Teng-hui in May that the 
South African Government under his leadership will continue its 
formal ties with the ROC. 
  Mandela met with Li in Pretoria on May 11 after he was sworn 
in as South Africa's first black president. Lu was present at 
the Li-Mandela meeting. 
  During their 15-minute talk, Lu said, Mandela told Li not to 
worry about relations between the two countries. 
  Mandela said his administration will follow the foreign 
policy adopted by the previous white minority governments and 
will continue its diplomatic ties with the ROC. 
  Lu quoted Mandela as stressing that unless the ROC does 
something unfavorable to South Africa, Pretoria won't cut its 
official ties with Taipei. 
  Mainland China is seeking to forge formal ties with South 
Africa. It, however, wants Pretoria to first cut its ties with 
the ROC. 
  Lu said although the new South African Government is willing 
to develop ties with Beijing, it won't accept Beijing's 
conditions. 
  The ROC has managed to improve its ties with the African 
National Congress, South Africa's current ruling party, Lu said, 
adding Taipei-Pretoria relations will remain solid in the years 
ahead. 
  President Li attended Mandela's inauguration in May to 
signify ROC's determination to strengthen its cooperation with 
South Africa. 
  After his meeting with Mandela, Li told overseas Chinese 
community leaders there that they can feel safe to "do big 
business" in South Africa as Taipei-Pretoria ties will remain 
strong.

  [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
and Niger signed a joint communique as well as two other pacts 
in Taipei Tuesday [7 June] morning pledging further cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  During the communique signed at the Presidential Office, 
both 
ROC President Li Teng-hui and Niger President Mahamane Ousmane 
reaffirmed their willingness to expand cooperation in 
agriculture, industry, commerce, and health. 
  The communique said Niger firmly supports the ROC's bid to 
join the United Nations and other international organizations 
and noted that Li agreed to visit Niger at Ousmane's invitation. 
  At the same time ROC Foreign Minister Chien Fu and Niger 
Foreign and Cooperation Minister Abdourahmane Hama signed a 
trade agreement and a Mix Commission of Cooperation pact at the 
Grand Hotel. 
  In the two agreements, both governments promised to 
strengthen civilian economic and trade ties between the two 
countries and agreed to offer necessary investment assistance as 
well as define future cooperation trends. 
  The pact stipulated that a group of minister-level officials 
from both countries be used to promote bilateral cooperation. 
Foreign ministers from both sides will serve permanent members 
of the Mix Commission of Cooperation. 
  The trade agreement picks up where a 1969 agreement left off 
after the two countries severed ties in 1974. Ties were 
restored in 1992. 
  At the Presidential Office, Ousmane thanked Li for the warm 
hospitality the ROC Government and people have extended to him 
during his six-day stay here. 
  Ousmane is leaving Taiwan Tuesday afternoon. A military 
ceremony will accompany his departure.

  [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan's private 
visit to Mexico underscores development in ties between Taiwan 
and the Central American country, Deputy Secretary-General 
Raymond Tai of the presidential office said Tuesday [7 June]. 
  Lien arrived in Mexico City Sunday afternoon for a three-day 
visit after concluding his official visit to El Salvador and 
Guatemala. 
  In a regular news conference, Tai noted that Taiwan should 
strengthen trade and cultural exchanges with Mexico, which forms 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United 
States and Canada. The NAFTA agreement became effective January 
1. 
  Taiwan and Mexico suspended official ties in 1971, however, 
trade ties between the two countries have been on the rise since 
1989. Two-way trade totaled U.S.$700 million in 1993, with 
Taiwan enjoying a surplus of U.S.$260 million. Taiwan opened an 
economic and cultural office in Mexico City on May 1. 
  Tai pointed out that the premier made the private visit to 
Mexico at the invitation of Mario Vazquez [word indistinct], 
president of the Association of National Olympic Committees and 
former chairman of the U.S.-based UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
news agency. 
  Vazquez, a media tycoon who controls 80 publications, radio 
stations, and television stations in Mexico, made a whirlwind 
visit to Taipei last August and met with President Li Teng-hui 
for two hours, he elaborated. 
  During the meeting, he said, Vazquez invited President Li to 
visit Mexico. Li, however, was unable to visit that country 
during his state visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica last month 
due to his tight schedule, he added. 
  Asked whether Li will visit Mexico in future, Tai quoted the 
president as saying that he is willing to visit any country for 
the sake of Taiwan's interests. 
  Tai reiterated that Mainland China should understand that 
Taiwan's cooperative ties with foreign countries aim to benefit 
both sides of the Taiwan Strait rather than disrupt the 
mainland's diplomatic ties with other countries. 
  Taiwan will continue to seek an active, positive role in the 
international organizations, Tai stressed, adding the government 
is obligated to promote economic and cultural ties with foreign 
countries and find trade opportunities for its traders.

  [Text] Taipei, June 8 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu disclosed Wednesday [8 June] that Premier Lien Chan did 
not meet Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his 
three-day stay in that country, as widely believed. Chien left 
Mexico Wednesday. 
  Chien made the remarks when answering questions by reporters 
at a farewell party for the Information &amp; Cultural Affairs 
Director Ouyang Jui-hsiung, who will take over the post of 
director-general at the Coordination Council for North American 
Affairs (CCNAA) office in Los Angeles. The CCNAA represents the 
Republic of China [ROC]'s interests in the United States in the 
absence of formal ties between the two countries. 
  Chien said he did not make public Lien's visit to Mexico 
beforehand because of an agreement between the two governments 
that neither side could release the news before Lien arrived in 
Mexico. 
  Chien said the reason he refused to comment on the 
possibility of a Salinas-Lien meet before Lien departed on his 
May 29-June 9 Central American tour was because the meeting had 
never been scheduled. Lien did meet with other ranking Mexican 
officials and Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the ruling party's 
candidate in the next presidential election. 
  Lien, currently in New York for a two-day family reunion 
with 
his two children, who study there, will return to Taipei 
Saturday, as scheduled, and hold a press conference, Chien said.

  [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Eleven Kuomintang members 
of the National Assembly on Tuesday [7 June] joined hands with 
their colleagues of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party 
[DPP] to form the "Single Parliament Promotional Committee." 
  Eight DPP National Assembly members are in the group, as 
well 
as one nonpartisan member. 
  Taiwan currently operates under a dual-parliament system. 
The National Assembly is in charge of revising the constitution 
and electing the president, and the Legislative Yuan is 
responsible for enacting laws and screening the national budget. 
  The DPP has been seeking to revise the constitution to 
abolish the National Assembly in an effort to accomplish its 
goal of a single parliament. The ruling party, however, does 
not consider such a change a top priority in its political 
reform program. 
  KMT National Assemblymen Cheng Yun-tang, one of the 
committee 
members, said the group will lobby hard to get the single 
parliament proposal approved by the National Assembly. The 
National Assembly is meeting in Yangminshan to discuss proposed 
amendments to the constitution. 
  National Assembly members have already submitted five 
proposals pertaining to changes in Taiwan's parliamentary system. 
  Another committee member, Chen Chen-shun, said that merging 
the National Assembly with the Legislative Yuan would be an 
easier way to achieve the goal of a single parliament.

  [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Four representatives of the 
families of the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in the March 31 
Qiandao Lake incident said Tuesday [7 June] that they will go to 
Hangzhou in southeastern Mainland China to witness the trial of 
the accused murderers, which begin this Friday. 
  [Words indistinct] said at a press conference at the 
Legislative Yuan they hope to see a fast conclusion to the 
incident [words indistinct] mainland authorities, whom they 
condemned as not having shown respect for the memories of the 
victims or concern for human rights. 
  Legislator Annette Lu, who accompanied family members of the 
24 victims at the conference, called on the entire nation to 
support them. She said she also had contacted a score of 
international human-rights organizations for support, and had 
demanded that mainland judicial authorities postpone the trial 
of the three men until facts surrounding the incident are made 
publicly known. 
  Meanwhile, H.Y. Hsu, deputy secretary-general of the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF), the semi-official organization that 
handles cross-strait affairs with Mainland China in the absence 
of formal ties, called on mainland authorities not to ignore the 
rights of Taiwan citizens who lost family members in the 
incident and not to shrug off the compensation issue. 
  As facts about the Qiandao Lake incident are not entirely 
clear, he said, mainland authorities should also continue 
investigating the incident and give reasonable explanations and 
answers to questions and doubts raised about it in a report 
released by SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council.

<F P=106> [By So Lai-fun, Stella Lee, and Catherine Ng] </F>
  [Text] Legislators yesterday condemned Governor Chris 
Patten for rejecting a concerted bid by major political parties 
to freeze the proposed rates [local taxes] increase. It was the 
first time in the territory's history that the council had 
condemned the chief executive. 
  Legislators voted 21 to 11 in support of the motion 
sponsored 
by United Democrat heavyweight Szeto Wah to "reprove" the 
Governor for "acting against the will of the public." 
  Citing the Royal Instructions, Mr Patten last month rejected 
a proposal from three major political parties to freeze the 
rates payment. 
  The Liberal Pany did not vote, even though it supported a 
freeze in the rates. 
  Legislators from the three parties -- the United Democrats, 
Meeting Point and the Liberal Party lashed out at the behaviour 
of the Governor, describing his move as "high-handed", 
"colonial" and "Draconian." 
  Mr Szeto said Mr Patten's use of a colonial privilege to 
veto 
a request with general public support should be denounced. He 
was to blame for the humiliation the government had suffered 
with an unprecedentedly low support of the legislature in the 
budget debate -- only 15 legislators support the government's 
proposed rates increase. 
  The Liberal Party accused the Government of brushing aside 
public aspirations and paying no respect to Legco, but said the 
wording of the motion was too strong. Party chief Allen Lee 
Peng-fei said it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence in 
the government. The party chose not to support, oppose, or 
abstain from voting. It did not want to abstain because that 
might give the impression the party had given up on the rates 
issue. 
  Meeting Point's Fred Li Wah-ming lamented the impotence of 
the Legislative Council [Legco], saying that even if the motion 
was passed, it would not in any way damage the governor's 
position because he was appointed by Britain. 
  Opposing the motion, appointed member Martin Barrow, who 
also 
spoke on behalf of six independent legislators, said it was 
dangerous to develop an "unrealistic vision" about the role of 
Legco and its relations with the executive. He said the rates 
issue was not significant and said the introduction of measures 
to spend public money or impose taxes was the "sole privilege" 
of the administration. "What Hong Kong people look for in a 
governor is leadership, not just acquiescence to political 
demands and what they look for in their council is responsible 
leadership in the best interests of Hong Kong, not a 
weathervane." 
  Appointed independent legislators Christine Loh Kung-wai and 
Anna Wu Hung-yuk, who were absent from voting, said the problem 
was the lack of accountability. "It is wrong to equate balance 
of power with the weakening of power with the executive. 
Executive-led government does not mean to control the 
legislature," said Ms Loh. 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod said in reply: "The 
motion is like 'crying wolf' when no wolf exists. "It should be 
reserved for serious policy or constitutional issues, or its 
impact is greatly devalued. Nor will it change the fact that 
the system simply would not work if it involved the executive 
rubber-stamping the views of the legislature," he said. 
  The proposed rates increase represented a minute increase in 
household income, which was hardly a sufficient cause for a 
"constitutional drama." He called on legislators to respect the 
power of the Government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Chris Patten Plays `Press Freedom Card'"] </F>
  [Text] Recently, Chris Patten has been very fond of 
playing the "press freedom card." After making a fuss about 
"press freedom" with regard to Xi Yang's case and a BBC 
documentary, he then used the administrative dispute inside Asia 
Television and the subsequent resignation incident to exaggerate 
matters, saying that "the Hong Kong Government is working hard 
to ensure that after 1997, Hong Kong can enjoy the press freedom 
it enjoys now, and the Hong Kong Government is looking at 
whether some regulations have been abused to jeopardize press 
freedom. If the Hong Kong Journalists' Association asks that 
more regulations should be examined, the Hong Kong Government 
will consider it." 
  That is to say, Patten's "press freedom card" is not just 
something to talk about, but will be implemented through 
amending many relevant regulations. 
  However, the biggest flaw in Patten's "press freedom card" 
is 
precisely reflected by the fact that in the past, the British 
Hong Kong authorities have for a long time exercised very tight 
control over news and information, however, since the signing of 
the Joint Declaration, and particularly as 1997 draws closer, 
they have suddenly amended regulations and even want to amend 
and abolish regulations which have been drafted for the normal 
management of news and information. This flaw shows that the 
Hong Kong British authorities are hypocritical when they talk 
lavishly about "press freedom," and that Patten uses "press 
freedom" to sow discord between Hong Kong's press circles and 
the Chinese side on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to 
amend relevant news and information regulations. He wants to 
kill two birds with one stone by trying to change some mass 
media in Hong Kong into a tool with which the British side 
confronts the Chinese side and to create difficulties in news 
and information management for the future special administrative 
region government. 
  In the past, the regulations used by the Hong Kong British 
authorities to restrict and control news and information were 
not only numerous but stringent also, and the British Hong Kong 
authorities once used these regulations to sue patriotic 
newspapers and ordered them to suspend publication; they also 
put certain journalists in jail. For a long time, the British 
Hong Kong authorities only allowed "press freedom" which 
protected and safeguarded colonial interests, while doing their 
best to attack and restrain real press freedom, which expressed 
other voices and ideas, and this method was an important 
component of colonial and despotic politics. Hong Kong's press 
circles have always expressed strong grievances with regards to 
this. 
  After the Hong Kong question was settled by the decision 
that 
Hong Kong would return to mainland China, and particularly as 
1997 draws closer, the colonial governor has suddenly changed 
into a savior who "defends Hong Kong's press freedom." He has 
ulterior motives. Patten once incited people by saying that 
"Hong Kong people must stand up to safeguard press freedom, not 
only after 1997 but also before 1997." People cannot but ask: 
What kind of "freedom" is this "press freedom" instigated by 
Patten? Only two examples are needed to illustrate the problem. 
  First, when China's judiciary acted according to the law to 
handle Xi Yang's case of stealing state secrets, this was 
totally unrelated to press freedom, but Patten used the 
opportunity to accuse the Chinese Government of suppressing Hong 
Kong's press freedom. According to Patten's logic, any person 
who wears a reporter's identity card can feel free to steal 
political, economic, and military intelligence and jeopardize 
state security without being punished by law. Where does this 
"freedom" exist in the world? In the 1989 Official Secrets Act, 
which was imported from Britain by the British Hong Kong 
authorities in 1992, six kinds of information continue to be 
restricted, including "confidential data obtained from another 
country." Is it not true that data stolen by Xi Yang for a 
certain Hong Kong newspaper to publish falls into the scope 
restricted by the Official Secrets Act? [sentence as published] 
In order to stubbornly assert that the crime of stealing state 
secrets was "press freedom" and "legitimate," Patten claimed 
that "more regulations" must be examined and amended, and this 
fully reveals Patten's wanton trampling on the spirit of the law 
and the system. 
  Second, when a Hong Kong television station decided not to 
broadcast a BBC documentary, Patten insinuated that Hong Kong's 
mass media were "exercising more self-discipline as 1997 draws 
closer," and he exerted pressure on the relevant television 
station by saying that he wanted to wait and see "if it would 
broadcast or not." This BBC documentary substituted one thing 
for another and fabricated and distorted facts in order to 
viciously slander Mao Zedong; when the relevant television 
station refrained from broadcasting it, this was a responsible 
attitude toward the audience, and precisely the kind of 
responsible attitude which is a guarantee of press freedom. 
What surprises people is that Patten went so far as to view the 
social responsibility of journalists as a mistake and a crime, 
against which he launched an attack. In Western countries, 
"news undertaking regulations" are very common, and journalists 
are restrained and guided by "responsibility," "justice," and 
"honesty." When media exercise self-discipline by conforming to 
the facts and according the external rules such as news 
regulations and policies, press freedom is not abused, press 
freedom can have a full role, and both things are guaranteed. 
Even the "slander regulations" of the British Hong Kong 
authorities stipulate that if a mass medium broadcasts or 
reports a program or information which is slanderous in nature, 
the relevant supervisory person can be arrested on criminal 
charges. Here we can see that when the television station 
refrained from broadcasting the BBC documentary which was 
slanderous nature, it embodied the application of press freedom 
both in terms of self-discipline and external rules, but Patten 
wantonly interfered in this and attacked it, and this precisely 
indicates that Patten tramples on and strangles press freedom 
and intervened in the television station's right to handle news 
at its own discretion. 
  What is laughable is that Patten plays the "press freedom 
card" enthusiastically on the one hand, and, on the other, tries 
hard to intervene in the mass media to control it, and, as a 
result, his "press freedom card" collapses into itself. When a 
colonial and despotic governor of Hong Kong sells "press 
freedom" as 1997 draws closer, and when he amends information 
management regulations and dismantles the machinery of the rule 
of law, the whole thing resembles his efforts to promote a 
"quickened pace of democracy," and the purposes is nothing but 
an attempt to sow discord among the Hong Kong people, incite 
them, poison relations between Hong Kong's mass media and the 
Chinese Government, serve the aim of extending Britain's 
political control over Hong Kong after 1997, pave a road for 
pro-Britain and anti-China political forces to expand their room 
to maneuver, and to allow disturbances and confrontation to 
arise in Hong Kong after 1997. However, Patten's "press freedom 
card," like all the "cards" he has played, will never succeed.

  [Text] Legislators yesterday said press freedom would be 
taken away if the government carried out a proposal to ban 
disclosing information about an investigation. 
  As a part of the Organised and Serious Crimes Bill and 
Criminal Procedures (Amendment) Bill 1992, the government 
proposed it be made an offence to disclose information likely to 
"prejudice" any investigation. The law would be restricted to 
an investigation which could lead to conviction resulting in a 
minimum fine of $20,000 and a year in jail. 
  The deputy solicitor-general, Robert Allcock, told the 
Legislative Council group studying the amendment that the ban 
could help to avoid any tip-off to the person under 
investigation. 
  Legislators feared that a new power prohibiting disclosure 
of 
investigation information would "go too far" against press 
freedom and public interest. A legislator, Emily Lau proposed 
that a separate clause should be put into the bill to state 
reasonable grounds for information disclosure if it was in the 
public interest. 
  Group members had reservations about the proposal to abolish 
the requirement binding judges to warn juries to treat 
"uncorroborated" evidence given by an accomplice "with caution." 
Allcock said accomplices might have an interest of their own in 
giving evidence against the defendant. However, the government 
said the directions a judge would be compelled to make would be 
so confusing as to make the law unworkable.

<F P=106> ["Special interview" by staff reporters Yin Shuguang (1438 </F>
2885 1639) and Lu Yansong (0712 1484 2646): "There Are Bright 
Prospects for Sino-Russian Cooperation--Interviewing Russian 
Ambassador to China Igor Rogachev"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 2 June (RENMIN RIBAO)--After the end of 
the visit to China by Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the 
Russian Federal Government, this morning, Mr Igor Rogachev, 
Russian ambassador to China, was interviewed by RENMIN RIBAO 
reporters, answering our questions about the current 
Russian-Chinese relationship. 
  [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, what comments would you like to 
make about Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China? 
  [Rogachev] The visit achieved substantial results and was 
constructive. The two countries signed seven agreements with 
extensive content. This further strengthened the legal 
foundation for the friendly cooperation between the two 
countries, and was a giant step forward in our bilateral 
relations. I deeply appreciate President Jiang Zemin's opinion 
on the need to have foresight in Russian-Chinese relations. 
President Jiang Zemin will visit Russia in the autumn of this 
year, and this will become another major milestone in the annals 
of Russian-Chinese relations. 
  [Reporter] Recently, Chinese and Russian leaders both 
stressed the need to face the 21st century and to consider and 
handle bilateral relations from this high plain. The Russian 
side also proposed the establishment of a "constructive 
partnership" with China. Mr Ambassador, would you please 
further explanation this? 
  [Rogachev] The proposal about the "constructive partnership" 
was put forth by President Yeltsin early this year. Recently, 
when meeting Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, President Jiang Zemin 
said: China thought that the Russian proposal was close to the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence China maintains for the 
development of state-to-state relations. The Russian side also 
agreed that the Chinese position coincided with with the Russian 
conception about the "constructive partnership." By 
"constructive partnership," we mean that as two great countries, 
Russia and China are completely equal, and there is no such 
thing as a "big brother" and a "little brother." Russia and 
China are both big powers in the world and share the same 
objectives of peace, security, and cooperation in international 
affairs. We hope to build close cooperative relations with 
China on the international stage and, first of all, in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The "constructive partnership" between the 
two countries should not harm the interests of any third country. 
  [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, in what ways do you think that Mr 
Prime Minister's visit to China has promoted the further 
development of Sino-Russian economic and trade relations? 
  [Rogachev] This time, the two countries signed a series of 
economic agreements on preventing double taxation and tax 
evasion. This will ensure the further development of economic 
and trade cooperation between the two countries. In addition, 
the joint committee of the two countries for economic, trade, 
scientific and technological cooperation also formulated a 
series of measures for resolving problems appearing in the 
course of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. 
  [Reporter] Last year, the volume of bilateral trade between 
China and Russia reached an all-time high, but it declined 
somewhat in the first quarter of this year as compared with the 
same period last year. How should this phenomenon be viewed? 
  [Rogachev] In my opinion, we should not exaggerate the 
seriousness of this issue. This was related to the economic 
conditions of the two countries. For example, the period of 
barter trade has come to an end. The two sides have to 
immediately take measures for the transition to a 
better-organized form of trade based on cash settlement. Of 
course, bilateral trade is also constrained by some other 
factors. For example, the banking system is still rather weak, 
and relevant laws and regulations have yet to be further 
improved. 
  [Reporter] In your opinion, what measures should be adopted 
in order to push Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to 
a new stage? 
  [Rogachev] We hope that China will increase investment in 
Russia, and the Russian side also plans to increase use of 
China's labor resources to develop infrastructural facilities in 
the Far East region. We shall also provide high and new 
technologies for your country in energy and other fields. 
Russian entrepreneurs hope to have the opportunity to 
participate in the Three Gorges project and other major 
construction projects in China. We have not yet made full use 
of the advantageous geographical condition of two countries 
which are adjacent to each other. The two governments should 
create better conditions for economic and trade cooperation at 
the border areas on both sides and should increase cooperation 
in the field of production. 
  [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, would you please describe the 
development prospects of Sino-Russian relations? 
  [Rogachev] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin said in Beijing that 
the two countries should work out an intermediate and long-term 
program for economic, trade, scientific, and technological 
cooperation. China and the Soviet Union have signed documents 
of this type in the past, but things have changed so greatly 
that we should update such documents on the basis of giving 
consideration to the wishes of Russia's Far East region and 
China's Northeast region. I believe that our two countries will 
make great developments and achievements in cooperation 
extending beyond the 21st century.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here today with a Buddhist 
delegation headed by the Myanmar [Burma] minister of religious 
affairs, Lieutenant-General Myo Nyunt. 
  The delegation arrived here on June 5 to convey Buddha's 
tooth relic back to China. The sacred tooth of Buddha of China 
was allowed to be taken to Myanmar (formerly Burma) from April 
20 to June 5. 
  Qian said that the sojourn of the tooth relic in Myanmar was 
an important event in Sino-Myanmar links and religious relations 
between the two countries. 
  He expressed thanks for the careful arrangement the Myanmar 
Government had made for the sojourn. 
  Nyunt said that to make the event, a milestone of their 
bilateral relations, the Myanmar Government decided to build two 
Buddha towers in Yangon [Rangoon], its capital, and Mandalay, 
its second largest city, using donations of the Myanmar people. 
  Over 85 percent of the Myanmar population are Buddhists, and 
the country's rich cultural heritage, glittering temples and 
pagodas are well-known throughout the world.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wang Zhongyu, 
minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, recently 
pointed out that state-owned enterprises in China have 
experienced some changes in the first quarter of this year, and 
one finds that state-owned enterprises are developing in a good 
direction if one makes an analysis based on facts. 
  Wang Zhongyu stressed that the operation of the new 
structure 
has been basically normal as measures related to the reform of 
the financial, taxation, banking, and foreign exchange 
structures are gradually being implemented. For a period to 
come, it is necessary to devote special efforts to improving 
state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to make further 
efforts to do a still better job in the transformation of 
enterprises operational mechanisms and the establishment of new 
mechanisms, conscientiously carry out pilot projects regarding 
the introduction of the bankruptcy system, sort out and clear 
debts, replenish funds at enterprises' disposal, reduce 
production output with a view to cutting stocks, reduce deficits 
and increase profits, and strengthen enterprise management so 
that state-owned enterprises will improve their conditions. 
  The State Economic and Trade Commission called its first 
overall economic operation coordination meeting a few days ago. 
While assessing the country's current economic situation, 
officials in charge of more than 10 ministries and commissions 
of the Chinese government attending the meeting showed extremely 
great concern for the present state of state-owned enterprises. 
  A report filed here earlier said that China's state-owned 
enterprises continued to see increased losses, with losses 
increasing by nearly 80 percent from January to March, and as 
many as 45 percent of state-owned enterprises operating at a 
loss. 
  Referring to this report, Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this 
was due to a misunderstanding. He disclosed that the number of 
enterprises in China which had stopped operations or were 
operating under capacity accounted for about 10 percent of all 
enterprises, and enterprises which have stopped operations made 
up about 4 percent. Since state-owned enterprises now practice 
the "general rules governing enterprise finance" and "codes for 
enterprise accounting" and have introduced production cost 
accounting with a view to aligning domestic accounting practices 
with accounting systems abroad, some expenses that used to be 
chargeable to enterprise profits in the past are now listed as 
production costs. This in turn resulted in a decrease in 
enterprise profits on the books. 
  Wang Zhongyu emphasized that state-owned enterprises' actual 
profits had increased, and the number of enterprises operating 
at a loss had decreased. 
  During this coordination meeting, Wang Zhongyu suggested 
that 
the performance of state-owned enterprises should be assessed 
from three aspects: 
  --The state has applied many new policies and measures to 
state-owned enterprises over the past few years, and party 
committees and governments at all levels, as well as enterprises 
themselves, have done a lot of work, and, as a result, 
state-owned enterprises have improved their position. 
  --Some enterprises are facing difficulties and problems in 
production and operations which should draw great attention and 
should be solved in real earnest. Solutions to these problems 
require some mandatory conditions to be fulfilled and this takes 
time. 
  --State-owned enterprises can survive and thrive, and the 
government is full of confidence about the reinvigoration of 
state-owned enterprises.

State Land Administration Bureau: "Enliven Land 
Property--Enlightenment Gained From the Comprehensive and 
Coordinated Reforms of Beijing No 1 General Light Industry 
Company"] 
  [Text] Under the guidance and with the support of 
departments concerned, the Beijing No 1 General Light Industry 
Company has carried out comprehensive and coordinated reforms 
and made useful attempts to enliven state assets and large and 
medium-sized enterprises. The core of the "No 1 Light Industry 
type" activation created by them is to reform the old land-use 
system, tap the tremendous potential in existing land assets, 
and make use of different rents to accumulate a large fund for 
activation. We can say that it is precisely by grasping this 
"golden key" of land that the reforms have been smoothly 
activated and carried out. This move has enabled people to 
fully understand the position and role of the reform of the 
land-use system in the entire reform of the economic structure 
and in economic development, and thus has opened up a new path 
for deepening the reforms and for faster development of the 
national economy and opening wider to the outside world. 
  The successful experience of the Beijing No 1 General Light 
Industry Company has at least enlightened us in two things 
concerning the land-use system. 
  The first thing is: Reform of the land-use system can 
effectively promote the transformation of large and medium-sized 
state enterprises. There have been many causes why large and 
medium-sized state enterprises have not been enlivened over a 
long period, but the main one is a shortage of funds. For a 
long time, state enterprises have had an excessive burden and 
have suffered losses in operation. They have been unable to 
provide funds for readjustment and transformation of the product 
mix and production setup. This has given rise to a vicious 
circle. Besides, quite a lot of state enterprises are located 
in golden areas of cities. Following deepening of reform of the 
land-use system, their land assets have attracted the attention 
of more and more people. The practice of the No 1 General Light 
Industry Company has widened the train of thought on making use 
of the "differential rent" of land to transform old enterprises. 
That is: They have pushed toward the market according to law 
land-use rights originally given them by the administration so 
that benefits obtained from land assets are revealed, and this 
has enabled enterprises to obtain valuable funds for activation 
and has provided motivation for further transformation of large 
and medium-sized state enterprises. 
  The second thing is: The experience of the No 1 General 
Light Industry Company has provided an effective way to deepen 
the reform of the system of allocating and using land in stock. 
The nationwide reform of the land-use system which began in 
1987 has fundamentally changed the system of allocating land by 
the administration without demanding compensation, without time 
limits, and without the right to transfer. The system of the 
transfer of land-use rights has been instituted, and a land 
market has been established. The advantages of such reform is 
shown in three aspects: Promoting rational use of land and 
optimizing land disposal; ensuring the realization of state 
revenue from land assets; and improving the investment 
environment. However, this reform has progressed faster and has 
obtained more apparent results in newly increased land for 
construction. Regarding the issue of entry into the market of 
land in stock originally allocated for use by the 
administration, although ways to overcome transfer formalities 
and charges for transfer have been worked out, not much progress 
has been made and enterprises are not very enthusiastic about 
them because of reasons including the lack of sufficient funds. 
This has affected the process of the entire reform of the 
land-use system. What is valuable in the experience of the No 1 
General Light Industry Company lies in enlivening, by means of 
shares controlled by the state, land assets allocated by the 
administration, strengthening enterprises' enthusiasm about 
pushing onto the market land originally used by them, thereby, 
providing an effective way to deepen reform of the land-use 
system and perfect the development of the land market. 
  From the comprehensive and coordinated reforms of the No 1 
General Light Industry Company, we can draw the conclusion that 
with the establishment of a modern enterprise system, enlivening 
and strengthening management of land assets are the requirements 
of enlivening large and medium-sized state enterprises and are 
also the needs of deepening reform of the land-use system. We 
must start studying how to solve the problem of land assets 
management in the course of establishment of a modern enterprise 
system so that land assets can serve the entire economic 
construction, reform, and opening up. 
  At present, various localities have started at selected 
points to carry out experiments on reorganizing state 
enterprises to make full use of state land assets in stock, and 
they have played an important role in promoting reorganization 
of state enterprises and in enlivening their assets. On the 
whole, the situation is good. However, problems such as unclear 
land property rights relationships, conversion of land assets 
into shares at low prices, sales of land assets at low prices, 
the transfer of land assets to individuals even without 
compensation or time limits, and so on, have also emerged in 
some localities in the course of reorganizing state enterprises. 
If these problems are not solved in good time, they will 
inevitably lead to losses, or losses in disguise, of state land 
assets in large quantities and will do harm to the establishment 
of a modern enterprise system. We must pay great attention to 
the above problems and seriously and earnestly adopt measures to 
solve them. Generally speaking, in the course of the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system, we must uphold the 
following principles in the disposal and management of land 
assets: The first is to ensure the maintenance and increase in 
value of state land assets and to prevent losses, or losses in 
disguise, of state assets. The second is to promote the 
reorganization and enlivening of assets of enterprises selected 
for carrying out experiments. The third is to ensure that the 
redisposal of state land assets of enterprises is in line with 
existing land laws and regulations and with the direction of 
development of reform of the land-use system. 
  To be specific, in the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, we should properly carry out work in three aspects in 
land asset management: 
  1. Clarify property rights and strengthen property rights 
management. To establish a land asset management system which 
meets the needs of a modern enterprise system, we should first 
of all fix land-use rights of enterprises and as soon as 
possible complete registration and issuance of certificates of 
land-use rights. Enterprises which already have certificates to 
use state land should have, when they are reorganized in 
accordance with the requirements of a modern enterprise system, 
the situation of using land in the original enterprises 
rechecked in accordance with the requirements of the 
registration on changes in land and have changes in land 
registered in accordance with changes in the use of land. 
  2. Properly carry out land appraisal and fix the quantity of 
land assets of enterprises. As reflected by the experience of 
the No 1 General Light Industry Company, land appraisal is the 
only means to correctly reflect the quantity of land assets of 
enterprises. Therefore, in accordance with the needs of 
developing the land market and the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system, we should energetically carry out the 
appraisal of base and benchmark land prices. The work of land 
appraisal should be carried out by land appraisal organs which 
have independent legal person status and can undertake civil 
responsibility. In appraising land assets, we should put 
forward a scientific and comprehensive appraisal report. Land 
appraisal results can be used as the basis for disposal and 
conversion into shares of land assets after they have been 
examined and confirmed by land management departments and 
reported to state assets management departments for the record. 
This can prevent the conversion or sale of land assets at low 
prices which will lead to the losses, or losses in disguise, of 
state land assets in large quantities. 
  3. Dispose land assets according to law and straighten out 
the relationship of distribution of benefits from land between 
the state and enterprises. In the course of establishment of a 
modern enterprise system, there are three ways to dispose of 
land assets: The first is for enterprises to handle transfer 
formalities and payment for the transfer of land-use rights. In 
this way, enterprises will have the land-use rights for a 
certain period of years and land assets will become assets of 
legal persons of enterprises. The second is for the state to 
use payment for the transfer of land-use rights as funds for 
obtaining shares, and these shares will be managed by units or 
departments authorized by the state. The third is for the state 
to provide land-use rights for reorganized enterprises in the 
form leases and to collect annual land rents. No matter which 
form reorganized enterprises may adopt, the relationship of 
benefits from land assets between the state and enterprises must 
be clearly defined. Firstly, state land assets should not be 
underappraised in any way. Secondly, out of consideration of 
enterprises' ability to bear and the needs of enlivening large 
and medium-sized state enterprises, payment of benefits obtained 
from land assets can be delayed or reduced, and enterprises may 
carry out operations while incurring debts, but the situation 
must be shown in accounts. We must also ensure by effective 
means that enterprises will hand over to the state the original 
value together with the added value of land assets after they 
have improved the conditions of operation. It is learned that 
in the near future, the No 1 General Light Industry Company will 
be able to attain goal of handing over benefits obtained from 
state assets to the state. 
  In short, comprehensive and coordinated reforms carried out 
by the Beijing No 1 General Light Industry Company have 
enlightened the people in many aspects. As representatives and 
managers for owners of state land assets, land management 
departments should emancipate their minds, carry out in-depth 
studies, energetically support reform, seriously sum up good 
experience and means of various localities, standardize and 
improve such experience and means in a bid to enliven land 
assets and deepen reform of the land-use system, and make 
greater contribution to the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system and to the development of the national economy.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (AFP)--Chinese paramount leader 
Deng Xiaoping -- who turns 90 in August -- is in good shape, his 
daughter, Deng Rong, was quoted Thursday as saying. "My father 
is not suffering from any illness and is in good shape," she 
said Wednesday during a visit to a charity, the Hope Project, 
which helps educate children in poor regions. 
  The report in the YOUTH DAILY added that Deng Rong gave the 
charity 15,000 yuan (1,700 dollars) -- the sum she recently won 
in a court judgement against a publisher accused of illegally 
printing copies of her biography of her father. 
  Deng Xiaoping has not been seen in public since February, 
when television pictures showed him at a Lunar New Year 
ceremony. He seemed in physical decline, with dull eyes and a 
shuffling gait.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 3 (CNS) -- The Guangzhou General 
Petrochemical Plant, which was listed as a processing base of a 
capacity of 10 million tonnes for imported sulphur bearing crude 
oil, is now under preparations for an expansion which was 
expected to come to completion by the end of this century, said 
the director of the plant Mr. Hong Zhiming in an interview with 
this agency. 
  The plant set up in the early 1970s was listed as the state 
key enterprise during the Seventh Five Year Plan period and was 
expanded in a large-scale. It was now equipped with 
installation for intensive processing of heavy oil. The plant 
took the lead in carrying out the processing of imported oil and 
refined nine kinds of domestic crude oil and 18 kinds of foreign 
crude oil. The capability of crude oil processing was up to 5.2 
million tonnes a year, making the plant an extraordinary large 
enterprise in South China. 
  After development of the plant into a refinery of a capacity 
of 10 million tonnes, according to the director, it would be 
able to exploit its potential for better production based on the 
original equipment and work force. It was expected that the 
spending on the expansion would be valued at US$1 billion, a 30 
percent cut of expense needed for construction of a new refinery 
of the same size. [as received] Shortage of capital could be 
settled by means of the shareholding practice and, with an 
effort, better economic results could be achieved. 
  Following the expansion, Mr. Hong said, the plant would be 
able to produce high-quality petrol, diesel oil and kerosene for 
aviation, all of which contain no lead. The products would be 
exported to Hong Kong, Singapore and Southeast Asia in addition 
to domestic sales. It would also be able to provide raw 
materials for further development of companies in the 
municipality in the future. 
  Supplementary projects for the expansion ofthe plant include 
a crude oil wharf of a capacity of 150 000 tonnes in Daya Bay in 
Huizhou, seabed pipelines measuring a total length of 9.7 
kilometres, petroleum pipelines of 180 kilometres long and 
storage facilities. Construction on these projects would start 
by the end of this month.

<F P=106> [Report by Southwest China staff reporter Yang Yung-nien </F>
(2799 3057 1628): "Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Secretary 
Xie Shijie Says During a Special Interview With WEN WEI PO 
Reporter That Sichuan Is Determined To Let Foreign Businessmen 
Make Profits and To Display the Superiority of the Market With a 
Population of 100 Million"] 
  [Text] Chengdu, 1 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- Xie Shijie, member 
of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Sichuan 
Provincial CPC Committee, told this reporter during a recent 
exclusive interview that his province this year would implement 
a strategy of "advancing great development by great opening up," 
a major move to implement the "crucial reform operation year" 
program set forth by the central authorities. Xie said this 
operation is to highlight Sichuan's special characteristics. In 
talking about seizing the opportunity, we mean to seize the 
opportunity in this respect: To expand and intensify the 
opening up process, to launch more cooperative projects, and to 
strive to score real results in forwarding economic development, 
he said. 
  As the party committee secretary of the most populous 
province of China, he told this reporter that Sichuan, as an 
inland province geographically isolated from the outside world, 
has made progress and done a good job in expanding contact with 
the outside world in recent years. The province has established 
friendly ties with dozens of Chinese and foreign provinces and 
cities. Now Sichuan is maintaining economic relations and 
trading with more than 120 countries and areas, and nearly 4,000 
foreign-funded enterprises are operating in the province. Two 
years ago, there were only several hundred foreign-funded 
enterprises in the province. Since Deng Xiaoping's southern 
tour, new foreign-funded enterprises have been established in 
Sichuan at a rate of more than 1,000 per year. The size of 
projects ranges from small to large, and projects of extra-large 
size are being launched one after another. An agreement has 
been signed with Mr. Tsui Tsin-tong to run the joint project of 
Mianyang-Chengdu expressway. Mr. Li Ka-shing is planning to 
invest in Sichuan province too, one of his projects being a 
housing project covering a total area of several million square 
meters. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie said: Chronologically speaking, Sichuan 
has made progress. But compared with other provinces in the 
country, this province is still lagging far behind. In view of 
this, early this year, eight provincial leaders, bringing dozens 
of department heads and bureau directors along with them, made 
fact-finding tours in six developed provinces, namely, 
Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shandong. 
They drew a conclusion from their tours that Sichuan province 
lags behind others mainly in two aspects: First, in terms of 
the extent of emancipation of mind, and second, in intensity of 
opening up. After repeated and thorough discussion on this 
question for several months, a consensus has now been reached 
within the province, from the upper to the lower levels. In 
order to develop its economy, Sichuan province needs to promote 
reform and development through opening up, and great opening up 
will in turn result in great development. Secretary Xie said: 
Sichuan province's financial resources are so limited as to be 
called "subsistence finance." So it is unrealistic to expect 
more funds to be allocated to finance construction projects. Of 
course we have considered asking for money from the central 
government in Beijing. Can we do this? Of course we can. But 
we can ask for money only once or twice, and we cannot keep 
asking for money again and again. Now we have an opportunity 
before us. Funds are available abroad, and foreign investors 
are looking for cooperation partners and investment 
opportunities. The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary 
noted: Now lots of investment projects have been launched in 
every coastal city which offers opportunities for investment, 
and preferential policies have been applied to wherever 
preferential policies should be applied to. Sichuan has a 
potential market with a 100 million population, and in the world 
today one cannot find another market with a 100 million 
population which is waiting to be explored. The province's 
economy is to be developed, the people's living standards are to 
be improved, and the demand is to increase. So this place with 
a population of 100 million will become an amazing, vast market! 
  The first in command of Sichuan province said: This year 
Sichuan province has taken new steps toward this target. 
Practice over the past few months shows that the results we 
have scored are quite good. The Chongqing mayor recently 
returned from an overseas trip with signed contracts involving a 
total value of $ 1.1 billion, including a value of $400 million 
that foreign partners have promised to pay in. Deyang city has 
drawn in a $100 million worth of foreign investments. 
Dujiangyan city has secured some $40 million worth of 
investment funds. 
  This provincial party committee secretary, born in the rural 
areas of eastern Sichuan, received his higher education at an 
agricultural college, and worked up step by step from the county 
and prefectural to provincial levels. Until today he still 
retains the simple and honest character of a Sichuan peasant. 
He chatted frankly and honestly without talking big. He said: 
"We have made it very clear that we will assure foreign 
investors of profits. Just imagine that they are coming a long 
way to make investments in this remote inland province. No 
project could possibly be started if it promises no profit." 
  Xie Shijie told this reporter that he and his colleagues had 
reached this consensus after drawing lessons from their past 
experience. Some localities invited many people to pay visits. 
The hosts and guests talked with each other cheerfully at 
meetings and parties. But no follow-up work was done after the 
meetings or parties, thus nothing was achieved. One of the main 
problems is that some of our people have haggled over every 
ounce. Therefore, the provincial party committee secretary has 
often warned cadres at all levels to ignore petty and short-term 
profits but focus on big and long-term interests instead. He 
said: We must do our best to really draw in foreign funds. 
After all, from a long-term point of view, it will be 
beneficial to Sichuan if we can have infrastructure and factory 
buildings built here. 
  The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary said: We 
must not apply the same formula to every investment plan, but 
must adopt tailor-made measures. Anyway, we must make every 
effort to retain foreign funds in our province. To conclude the 
interview, Secretary Xie Shijie said to this reporter with an 
open mind: Sichuan province has started opening up a bit later 
than others, and we have less experience in this regard. But we 
have made up our minds to blaze new trails and to do a good job. 
The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary urged this 
reporter to pass a message on to readers abroad: Sichuan 
province is trustworthy, its cadres have liberal minds and will 
sincerely and wholeheartedly cooperate with friends from abroad. 
The Sichuan provincial party committee secretary also promised: 
"We certainly will protect all investors' legitimate interests."

  [Text] This year, the province has been hit by a severe 
drought unknown over the past 10 years, which has devastated 
summer grain crops to a serious extent and threatened autumn 
grain crops as well. As a result, drought resistance and 
disaster relief are now an overriding task for the province's 
rural work. Given the rigorous drought situation at the moment, 
the province held a drought resistance and disaster relief 
teleconference yesterday afternoon. 
  The teleconference disclosed that since last September, the 
province has received less than 50 percent of its usual rainfall 
and got only meager rainfall last May when wheat was sprouting 
and in the flowering and autumn sowing period. The province's 
total reservoir water storage capacity has also dropped by 100 
million cubic meters compared with the same period of last year. 
As a result, some 970,000 people and more than 730,000 head of 
livestock will be affected by a short supply of drinking water. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang spoke at 
yesterday's teleconference calling on all areas and departments 
concerned in the province to take drought resistance and 
disaster relief as an overriding task for the province's rural 
work at the moment, make sufficient ideological preparations for 
waging a whole-scale drought resistance struggle across the 
province, fully mobilize and rely on enthusiasm of the broad 
masses of cadres and people, adopt comprehensive 
drought-resistance measures, assemble all available human, 
material, and financial resources for drought resistance and 
disaster relief work, strive to protect the province's grain 
crops by all means, and make every possible endeavor to reduce 
the province's drought-related losses to a minimum. 
  Secretary Yan Haiwang noted: While implementing the relevant 
drought resistance measures in a timely fashion, we should also 
show great concern and make flawless arrangements for people's 
livelihood, carry out in-depth and meticulous work in disaster 
areas, and make effective use of disaster relief funds. 
  Provincial Vice Governor Cai Xiaosu also spoke at the 
teleconference spelling out comprehensive arrangements for the 
province's drought resistance and disaster relief work.

  [Text] New York, June 7 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
Premier Lien Chan arrived in New York Tuesday [7 June] evening 
after a whirlwind visit to Mexico. 
  Lien is the first incumbent premier from the ROC to visit 
New 
York since Taipei and Washington severed diplomatic ties in 1979. 
  Previously, Lien was only allowed to make transit stops in 
Los Angeles or Miami on his way to Central American countries. 
  Lien and his wife arrived in New York at 7:55 P.M. Lien said 
his New York tour is purely for private purposes. 
  ROC Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen, who accompanied the 
premier on his Mexican tour, also traveled to New York with Lien. 
  On hand to greet the Liens at the airport were Ding 
Mou-shih, 
ROC representative in the United States, and Natale Bellocchi, 
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial 
conduit for US-Taiwan ties. 
  Lien will stay in New York for two days. ROC officials 
stationed here said Lien is here for a family reunion with his 
two children who are studying at Columbia University. "We have 
not arranged any public activities for Lien during his stay 
here," the officials said. 
  Lien just wrapped up a groundbreaking visit to Mexico where 
he reportedly met with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari and many other senior Mexican officials to discuss ways 
to promote bilateral commercial and tourist exchanges. Lien 
reportedly also met with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who will 
represent Mexico's ruling party in the country's forthcoming 
presidential election. 
  Lien was the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico 
since the two countries cut diplomatic ties in 1971. 
  ROC Government Spokesman Jason Hu, who flew to Los Angeles 
Sunday after accompanying Lien on his official visits to El 
Salvador and Guatemala, would not confirm whether Lien had met 
with the Mexican president. 
  Hu instead said Lien "satisfactorily accomplished his goals 
as expected" during his two-day stay in Mexico. "Albeit 
unofficial, Lien's Mexican visit was fruitful and laid a solid 
foundation for future cooperation between the two countries," he 
noted. 
  Quoting Foreign Ministry officials who accompanied Lien on 
his Mexican tour, Hu said Lien had reached consensus with 
Mexican officials on a number of programs to promote bilateral 
exchanges. Among others, the Mexican Government will send a 
trade mission to Taiwan later this month to court Taiwan 
investors. 
  Lien will leave here Thursday and is scheduled to return to 
Taipei Saturday, ending his four-country tour.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A member of Hong Kong's 
Government said Thursday [9 June] he hopes China's veteran 
leader Deng Xiaoping dies before the British crown colony's 
return to China in July 1997 so that clarification of China's 
future course can be made by then. 
  "From the point of view of Hong Kong people, it's better for 
Deng to go earlier than later," said Edward Chen, who sits on 
the 15-member Executive Council, Hong Kong's cabinet. 
  Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, Chen 
likened Deng's last years to the final period of a dynasty, with 
government decisions paralyzed due to the unclear outcome from 
an anticipated power change. 
  "Nobody will dare make major decisions, because if you did 
something wrong, it will be disastrous and nobody will want to 
take this responsibility," Chen said. 
  He dismissed scenarios predicting an outbreak of violence or 
the country's disintegration should the mastermind of China's 
opening policy and market reforms die. 
  Deng, who will be 90 in August, has frequently been rumored 
seriously ill or dead and seemed frail during his last televised 
public appearance during the Chinese new year festival in 
February. 
  "Power struggle is inevitable, but I don't think there will 
be huge bloodshed after Deng," he said. 
  With the purging of second-generation politicians such as 
reformer Zhao Ziyang, and the current leading trio of President 
Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and economic czar Zhu Rongji 
being "too old," China's old guard will eventually be succeeded 
by leaders emerging from the fourth generation, Chen predicted. 
  These leaders in their 50s can be trusted because they have 
lived through the "bitter experience" of the Cultural 
Revolution, but have also experienced 15 years of opening 
policy, he said. 
  Chen, who is also a professor of economics, painted a bright 
picture for China's future, saying there is no doubt the country 
will become an engine for growth for the world economy, 
overtaking the United States in terms of gross national product 
in 2010. 
  The "rising star" among China's booming regions is the 
Yangze 
River [Chang Jiang] valley, stretching from western Sichuan 
Province to Shanghai on the coast, because it offers "tremendous 
investment opportunities" with its concentration of heavy and 
military industries, he said. 
  He urged foreign investors to look into the service sector, 
which will further open up in line with Beijing's bid for 
reentry into the GATT world trade system, he said. 
  With a population of 1.2 billion and an increasingly 
well-off 
middle class, China constitutes a "gold mine" for the financial 
and insurance business, he said. 
  Japanese investors should also be aware that China is no 
longer a market for cheap mass products. "You have to aim at 
the top end of the market," Chen said. 
  China is a large investor abroad and a major recipient of 
foreign investment, which reached 90 billion to 130 billion Hong 
Kong dollars in 1993, Chen said. The nation is "too integrated 
in the world economy" to make an about-face in its economic 
policy, he added. 
  "There is no way that the open-door policy will be 
reverted," 
Chen said. "I think Hong Kong will be all right after 1997."

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said here today in reply 
to a reporter's question that we must not lose the direction of 
trying to solve the DPRK nuclear issue as it will be very 
difficult to step back once we have lost it. 
  Shen Guofang said: The direction is that of safeguarding 
peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and promoting its 
denuclearization. China hopes that all the parties concerned 
work toward these two basic goals, will continue to seek a 
peaceful way to properly solve the DPRK nuclear issue, and will 
refrain from practices that may intensify the contradiction. 
  Shen said: There is still room and the possibility of a 
proper solution despite the present difficulties with the DPRK 
nuclear issue. Therefore, China does not favor the involvement 
of the UN Security Council in the DPRK nuclear issue and does 
not agree to sanctions against the DPRK because that will push 
all sides concerned toward the brink of confrontation, which may 
cause consequences no side wishes to see. 
  Shen said: China is not clear about the details of the DPRK 
nuclear development program, and it is hard for China to predict 
what moves the DPRK will make once sanctions are imposed. But 
sanctions are not a good method. Experience in solving 
international issues tells us that sanctions often intensify 
contradictions and lead to conflict. 
  He stressed: There are many complicated factors in the DPRK 
nuclear issue. Two things are very important in solving this 
problem: Patience and a certain amount of time. China hopes 
all the parties concerned remain calm and maintain restraint and 
do not close the door on negotiations so easily. Efforts over 
the last year show that there will be progress if talks between 
the four corners and the three sides are resumed, and a crisis 
if talks stop. 
  Shen Guofang also revealed details about this morning's 
working meeting between the Chinese and ROK foreign ministers, 
saying that the two sides exchanged their views on the situation 
in great depth. There is some common ground: They both hope 
that the trend toward peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula can be maintained, neither wants to see any serious 
consequences, and they agreed that further efforts are required 
to solve the DPRK nuclear issue.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the 
current world, with various political forces disintegrating and 
realigning, is proceeding in the direction of multi-polarization. 
  Qian made the remarks in a report delivered at a meeting 
jointly held by the Propaganda Department of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the work 
committee of the departments of CPC Central Committee and other 
departments here today. 
  He analyzed the new characteristics of the current 
international situation, saying that the world is undergoing 
drastic and complicated changes. 
  The development of the world economy is in imbalance, Qian 
said, adding that economic competition and trade friction were 
intensifying and economic factors were playing a bigger role in 
international relations. 
  He continued that China's reform and opening to the world 
policies had tapped the potential of the country's huge market, 
which has created good conditions for economic cooperation and 
trade between China and the rest of the world. 
  The Chinese foreign minister briefed the meeting on the 
development of China's foreign affairs in recent years. Firmly 
pursuing the independent foreign policy of peace and overcoming 
many difficulties, China has made fresh achievements in its 
diplomacy, he said. 
  Since the beginning of this year, Qian noted, over ten 
presidents and government heads, as well as more than 20 foreign 
ministers of other countries had toured China, while Chinese 
leaders have visited more than 30 countries around the world. 
  China's cooperative relations with developing countries have 
been strengthened, Qian said, adding that fresh progress has 
been made in Sino-U.S. ties and relations between China and 
other Western countries. 
  Qian stated that China has become an important factor in the 
peace and stability of the international community and has 
dedicated itself to maintaining global and regional peace. 
  He concluded that the development of the international 
situation was beneficial to China in general, stressing that 
China should take advantage of all the favorable factors and get 
rid of unfavorable ones to create a peaceful international 
environment for its modernization drive.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zheng Zhihai (6774 1807 3189): "Wu Yi on </F>
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Uruguay Round of Trade 
Talks"] 
  [Text] China has been making a dynamic effort to restore 
its status as signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade [GATT] and has taken many courses of action to that end. 
But the promises we make have to be within what China's economy 
can tolerate. To safeguard China's social stability and 
sustained economic development is of overriding importance. We 
will not sacrifice our vital interests in order to "rejoin GATT" 
and if it is an either-or situation, we would rather not "rejoin 
GATT." This is a remark made by Wu Yi, minister of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, when interviewed by this 
reporter the other day. 
  When commenting on the pros and cons of "rejoining GATT," Wu 
Yi said: The analysis of pros and cons should be objective. On 
the one hand, we must not entertain unrealistic illusions about 
the benefits that "rejoining GATT" might bring and think that we 
will reap a lot of economic benefits after "rejoining GATT." 
Yet on the other hand, we should not paint a very dark picture 
of the effects of "rejoining GATT" and believe that it will 
cause a rampant influx of foreign goods, in the face of which 
many of China's own industries will collapse. One should say 
that there are more pros than cons for us in "rejoining GATT." 
Today, when the world is moving toward multipolarization after 
the cold war, we can, by joining a multilateral trading system, 
maintain the markets we have opened up in a relatively stable 
fashion and will find it easier to open up new markets. After 
"rejoining GATT," we can, in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of GATT, gradually get rid of discriminatory trade 
behavior imposed on China by many countries and enjoy the fair 
trade treatment stipulated by GATT. Secondly, we can also take 
advantage of the multilateral rules of GATT to resist the 
unilateral trade retaliation exercised by some Western powers 
and put them under political and moral condemnation. In 
addition, "rejoining GATT" can help boost the confidence of 
foreign economic and trade circles in China's trade environment 
and investment environment. It is even more true of those major 
overseas companies and multinationals that are concerned with 
medium-term and long-term interests. What are the cons? To put 
it simply, we must further lower our tariffs and open up our 
domestic market, which may have an impact on some products. But 
we are following a policy of selective protection and gradual 
opening in order to minimize such an impact. 
  On the hot topic of "when to rejoin GATT," Wu Yi said: It 
has been eight years since we filed an application for rejoining 
GATT, and the China GATT team has conducted 16 rounds of talks. 
Now the procedure has entered the important stage of 
negotiating on tariff reduction and deliberating the agreement 
on China's "rejoining GATT." We wish to "rejoin GATT" before 
the World Trade Organization is officially founded, so that 
China can become one of the founding nations of the World Trade 
Organization that is to replace GATT. The problem now is that 
some signatories from the West are too demanding in such areas 
as tariff reduction, market access, and service trade. In 
particular, one or two countries appear to be supporting China, 
but are actually creating all sorts of obstacles. The talks will 
still take some time because there is still a wide gap between 
the bargaining parties. Naturally, we will not try to "rejoin 
GATT" at all costs simply for the sake of "rejoining GATT." 
Despite the many problems at present, our attitude remains that 
of striving hard to succeed. 
  Wu Yi spoke highly of the final document of the 
Uruguay-round 
talks that China recently signed. She said: China took part in 
the entire process of Uruguay-round talks and in the end signed 
the final document together with other participants. It marked 
China's return to the world's multilateral trade system, 
whereupon China solemnly undertook to observe the latest 
international trade rules. This is of profound and far-reaching 
significance to our establishing a socialist market economic and 
legal system. Our promise will also help boost confidence in 
China among world investors and businessmen. 
  The direct economic implications for us of the results of 
the 
Uruguay-round talks should be analyzed case by case. Wu Yi 
said: Some of the many agreements contained in the final 
document may have more pros than cons for us. Take the 
agreement on textiles for example. Because the textile market 
will be fully opened up, our country, enjoying a relative 
advantage in the textile industry, may perform better in textile 
exports. But in the case of the agreement on agricultural 
products, because subsidies for agricultural exports will be 
phased out, China will have to pay a high price as it is a major 
importer of agricultural products. She believed that the 
Uruguay round's impact on different countries is not even. 
Whoever has faster economic development, more products that 
enjoy greater advantages, and a bigger export volume will 
benefit more from the results of the multilateral trade talks. 
Therefore, the foundation of the work on foreign economic 
relations and trade is at home and lies with domestic economic 
development and industrial structural adjustment.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Shui Ming (3055 2494): </F>
"The Nonaligned Movement Is Still Full of Vigor and Vitality"] 
  [Text] Foreign ministers and representatives of foreign 
ministers from 109 nonaligned nations gathered recently in Cairo 
to discuss the role and mission of the organization in the 
post-Cold War period. They then signed the "Cairo Declaration" 
and other documents. This was another gratifying event in the 
development of the Nonaligned Movement. 
  The Nonaligned Movement mounted the world's political stage 
in the 1960's. In those years, being sandwiched between the two 
major military blocs in the East and the West, the small and 
medium-sized Third World countries were deeply harmed by this 
confrontation. Therefore, Tito, al-Nasir, Nehru, and some other 
statesmen put forward the idea of "independence, 
self-determination, and non- grouping." Their proposal won 
extensive support in the Third World, and the Nonaligned 
Movement arose, rapidly developing into a dynamic political 
force representative of the Third World. The Nonaligned 
Movement produced a major impact on the world pattern and the 
balance of strength in the Cold War period, and made indelible 
contributions to the just struggles of various peoples against 
imperialism, colonialism, and hegemonism. 
  Today, as the Cold War has come to an end, there is an 
opinion negating the Nonaligned Movement. This opinion holds 
that the environment for the appearance and development of the 
Nonaligned Movement no longer exists, so the historical mission 
of the Nonaligned Movement has been completed. However, foreign 
ministers of the nonaligned nations attending the Cairo meeting 
disagreed with this point of view. At the concluding session, 
the Egyptian foreign minister said: "We have not reached the 
end of the history of the Nonaligned Movement. We must become 
the voice of the Third World." 
  The objective facts also show that the mission of the 
Nonaligned Movement is still far from being completed. Although 
the Cold War has come to an end, power politics and hegemonism 
remain in international relations. The Nonaligned Movement, 
which is not outdated, should continue to play a role in 
international affairs so as to safeguard the interests of the 
Third World countries. 
  In addition, although many nonaligned nations have won 
political independence, most of them remain in a relatively 
backward economic condition because they were plundered and 
exploited over a long period of time by imperialism and 
colonialism, and are still constrained by the current 
unreasonable international economic order. They must be united 
and must strive jointly for equal development rights. This has 
become a new and major task for the Nonaligned Movement, and 
this also will be a more arduous and complicated struggle. At 
the Cairo meeting, the nonaligned nations began to stress the 
issue of economic development. The document published at the 
end of the meeting explicitly criticized the trade protectionism 
pursued by the developed nations under the guise of 
environmental protection and human rights, and also urged the 
developed nations to help reduce the foreign debts borne by the 
developing countries and to fulfill their solemn promise of 
using 0.7 percent of their gross national product to assist the 
undeveloped countries in the Third World. 
  As the world is developing into a multipolar pattern, the 
Nonaligned Movement is still full of vigor and dynamism, and 
remains a weighty political force in the international arena. 
In the ongoing trend of international economic integration, the 
countries of the Nonaligned Movement will shift the focus of its 
activities to the field of developing their economies, 
strengthening South-South cooperation, and promoting North-South 
dialogue. This will bring new vigor to the Nonaligned Movement.

  [Text] Washington, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. House of 
Representatives voted today to unilaterally lift the arms 
embargo on Bosnia, which would in effect violate a U.N. 
resolution. 
  By a vote of 244-178, the House urged President Bill Clinton 
to end the ban and allow arms flow to the Bosnian Muslims, who 
were seen as the "grieved side" in the Balkan war. 
  Although against the U.N.-authorized arms ban, the Clinton 
administration maintains that unilateral end of the embargo 
would undermine other U.S. foreign policy goals. 
  The Senate adopted a similar measure earlier as an amendment 
to the fiscal 1995 bill. 
  For the two amendments to have legal binding effects, the 
House and Senate will have to negotiate further. 
  And President Bill Clinton could also veto the measure, 
which 
can only be rejected by a two-third vote in Congress. 
  The Clinton administration tried in vain to avert Thursday's 
[9 June] vote by sending Defense Secretary William Perry, Under 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili to the capitol. 
  In a joint statement to the House, the three warned that 
"unilateral U.S. actions will fracture the NATO alliance and put 
us at odds with Russia." 
  For his part, Clinton wrote to Representative Lee Hamilton 
that "U.S. action to lift the embargo would bring the peace 
process to an end, destroying the unified approach we, our 
allies and the Russians have been working to achieve." 
  Thursday's vote had been planned earlier but was postponed 
at 
the request of the administration to avoid embarrassing Clinton 
while attending the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the 
D-Day.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher reiterated today his country's commitment to 
NATO's expansion and welcomed Russia's intention to participate 
in the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program without 
preconditions. 
  Speaking at the North Atlantic Council (NAC) meeting held 
here, Christopher quoted President Bill Clinton as saying that 
"Now the question is no longer whether NATO will take on new 
members, but when and how we will do so." 
  He stressed that Russia figures prominently when considering 
NATO's relationship with nations to the East. 
  "Whatever course its internal evolution may take, Russia is 
and will remain a vital actor in European security affairs," 
said Christopher, adding that "It is our interest -- and 
Russia's -- to develop broad, constructive interaction between 
NATO and Russia." 
  In addition to the PFP program, the U.S. also welcome other 
cooperations with Russia, including the "16"1" formula, added 
Christopher. 
  Although the U.S. recognizes Russia's legitimate concerns in 
the states that emerged from the Soviet Empire, Christopher 
warned that "No country has a right to assert a role that is 
inconsistent with international norms." 
  He went on to say that Europe's stability and security is 
also based on the treaty on conventional forces in Europe and 
the U.S. is committed to maintaining the integrity of the treaty 
over the long term. 
  Foreign ministers from 16 NATO member states attended the 
NAC 
spring meeting in Istanbul to participate in the tough task of 
working out a common approach to NATO-Russian relationship.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers from 
16 NATO countries agreed here today to develop "constructive 
relations" with Russia, which they believe can make an important 
contribution to European stability and security. 
  In a joint communique released at the end of the North 
Atlantic Council meeting, the alliance reaffirmed its strong 
support for political and economic reform in Russia and 
recognized the important role Russia can play on a wide range of 
issues. 
  "We wish to develop constructive relations of mutual 
respect, 
benefit and friendship between Russia and the alliance," said 
the communique. 
  NATO foreign ministers especially expected that Russia will 
also join the Partnership for Peace (PFP) program and work out 
an "extensive and far-reaching individual plan, corresponding to 
its size, importance, capabilities and willingness to contribute 
to the pursuit of shared objectives." 
  The PFP program, unveiled at January's NATO summit in 
Brussels, was designed to prevent a security vacuum by offering 
Warsaw Pact countries the prospect of eventual membership of the 
alliance, but this was interpreted by Russian nationalists as an 
attempt by the West to extend its influence into Russia's 
frontiers. 
  During the one-day NAC spring meeting held in Istanbul, NATO 
ministers reviewed the implementation of the January summit 
decisions and voiced their particular satisfaction with the 
positive reception of the PFP initiative. 
  In the context of PFP, the first peace-keeping exercises 
will 
take place this autumn in the Netherlands and Poland, said the 
communique. 
  However, the NATO ministers maintained that the dialogue 
with 
former Warsaw Pact countries mof [must of] course, affect NATO's 
right to take its own decisions on its own responsibility by 
consensus of its members." 
  In a bid to enhance the alliance's ability to respond to 
crisis, NATO ministers vowed to continue their work on the 
"combined joint task forces." 
  Concerning the conflict in the former Yugoslavia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], the joint communique urged the 
parties to reach a political settlement at the negotiating table 
and not on the battlefield. 
  The North Atlantic Council called for a full and timely 
implementation of the existing disarmament agreements. 
  A number of other regional issues including tensions in the 
southern Caucasus and NATO's relations with other international 
institutions were discussed as well at the NAC meeting.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers from 
16 NATO countries hope to establish a "dialogue and 
cooperationship" with Russia, a high-ranking NATO official said 
here today. 
  Speaking at a press conference following an one-day NATO 
foreign ministers meeting, Sergio Balanzino, deputy NATO 
secretary-general, said that Russia has a special position in 
Europe and a good cooperationship between NATO and Russia is 
very vital to the stability and security of Europe. 
  Balanzino said that the alliance welcomes Russia to sign the 
Partnership for Peace, but he reaffirmed that NATO will not give 
"the special position" to Russia. 
  He said that the program of the Partnership for Peace will 
come true, and it is a very satisfying matter for the stability 
and security of Europe. 
  The Partnership for Peace program provides for broad 
political and military cooperation, including joint maneuvers 
and NATO help in defense planning and in converting arms 
industries to civilian purposes. It stops short of providing 
any security guarantees, but will allow for eventual NATO 
membership for some East European nations. 
  If Russia signs a basic partnership agreement, NATO would be 
ready to broaden cooperation into such areas as nuclear arms and 
safety and European security issues. 
  The joining of the Partnership for Peace by he former East 
Block countries will strengthen not only the political 
relationship but also the military cooperation between the two 
sides, said the official. 
  In a joint communique released at the end of the NATO 
meeting, the ministers agreed to develop "constructive 
relations" with Russia, which they believe can make important 
contribution to European stability and security. 
  "We wish to develop constructive relations of mutual 
respect, 
benefit and friendship between Russia and the alliance," said 
the communique. 
  During the meeting, a number of other regional issues, 
including tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in southern 
Caucasus and NATO's relations with other international 
institutions, were also discussed. 
  Foreign ministers from 41 member states of the North 
Atlantic 
Cooperation Council will meet here Friday [10 June] to discuss 
the partnership between NATO member states and newly jointed 
countries.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The ministerial meeting 
of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) adopted here today a policy 
framework on preventing proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD). 
  The adoption was made at the end of the one-day NATO foreign 
ministers meeting which were attended by 16 NATO member states. 
  The NAC said that major political changes on the European 
continent following the break-up of the former Soviet Union also 
have potential proliferation implications that required close 
attention. 
  It added that a number of states on the periphery of the 
alliance continue in their attempts to develop or acquire the 
capability to produce WMD and their delivery means or to acquire 
illegally such systems. 
  "Similarly, the growth of indigenously developed WMD-related 
technology has also made proliferation more difficult to 
control," the NAC said. 
  "In addition, there is the risk that a proliferator might 
seek to profit or gain political benefit by selling WMD and 
their delivery means, relevant technology and expertise," stated 
the meeting. 
  The NAC agreed that current international efforts focused on 
the prevention of WMD and missile proliferation through a range 
of international treaties and regimes. 
  The most important normsetting treaties are the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention 
(CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC). 
  It pointed out that the BTWC can be strengthened through 
efforts in the field of transparency and verification. 
  It also added that the allies furthermore supported other 
relevant efforts in the field of non-proliferation and arms 
control. 
  "The alliance policy on proliferation is aimed at 
supporting, 
reinforcing and complementing, not at duplicating or 
substituting the aforementioned treaties and regimes," the NAC 
said.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch from Beijing": Report on interview with </F>
Wu Yi, minister of foreign economic relations and trade, by Xiao 
Lu (5135 6424), in Hong Kong; date not given: "Development 
Trend of Sino-U.S. Economic and Trade Cooperation Judged From Wu 
Yi's Visit to the United States"] 
  [Text] In late April, Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation, paid a week-long unofficial visit to Hong 
Kong and Macao on her way home from a 12-day visit to the United 
States during which she headed a delegation to a meeting of the 
Eighth Sino-American Commerce and Trade Joint Commission. 
  The aim of her visit to Hong Kong and Macao was to 
participate in the meetings of the boards of Hong Kong's China 
Resources Group and Macao's Nam Kwong Group, which are 
subsidiaries of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC]. Therefore, except for holding meetings 
and visiting some Chinese-funded enterprises, she did not appear 
on any other occasion. From the first day she arrived in Hong 
Kong, however, she became the focus of the well-informed Hong 
Kong and Macao media. Reporters began to follow her wherever 
she was. Television, radio, and newspapers carried reports 
about her. 
<H5>  Closely Bound Up With Hong Kong's Economy </H5>
  The reason Hong Kong media paid so much attention to Wu Yi's 
Hong Kong visit is, first, because Hong Kong and Macao media 
were very concerned about the results of the minister's 
just-ended visit to the United States. The development trend of 
economic relations and trade between China and the United States 
-- and particularly the question of whether the United States 
would extend China's most- favored-nation [MFN] trading status 
-- is closely bound up with Hong Kong's economy. According to 
the Hong Kong Government's estimation, if MFN status were 
terminated, Hong Kong would suffer a loss of trading 
opportunities ranging from HK$133 billion to HK$187 billion, 
Hong Kong's GNP would shrink by a range between HK$19 billion 
and HK$26 billion, and the number of people whose employment is 
affected will range between 54,000 to 57,000. 
  In a special interview with our staff reporters in Hong 
Kong, 
Wu Yi said that one of her important tasks during the U.S. visit 
was to preside, together with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald 
Brown, over the meeting of the Eighth Sino-American Commerce and 
Trade Joint Commission, held in Washington 13-14 April. She 
thought that the meeting was a success and that it laid a good 
foundation for the establishment of long-term, stable 
cooperative economic relations and trade between China and the 
United States. 
  As an annual meeting between the Chinese and U.S. 
Governments, the meeting of the Sino-American Commerce and Trade 
Joint Commission was the most important mechanism of 
consultation for questions related to bilateral economic 
relations and trade. Wu Yi said: "The meeting discussed a wide 
range of economic and trade issues of common concern. Both 
sides thought this kind of discussion was frank and pragmatic. 
At the end of the meeting, a joint declaration regarding 
cooperation in industrial technology was signed." 
  Please do not think the phrases "a wide range of," "frank," 
and "pragmatic" are some everyday diplomatic terminology. As 
far as this author knows, behind these adjectives were practical 
contents. For example, questions the two ministers discussed 
included MFN status, trade deficit, market access, and 
intellectual property rights. Moreover, under the framework of 
the three working teams for investment, industrial cooperation, 
and law, the Joint Commission meeting was divided into 18 small 
groups for discussions on special topics including finance, 
trade statistics, export control, commercial law, and 
intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the joint declaration 
the was finally issued announced the establishment of 
trade-financing and trade-promotion working teams, thus 
restoring the bilateral law symposium and establishing a 
commercial law working team. These were two highly constructive 
concrete results. 
<H5>  Advance Amid Frictions </H5>
  Wu Yi's basic comment on Sino-U.S. economic relations and 
trade was "advance amid frictions." She said that despite the 
frequent frustrating and restless days, trade volume between the 
two countries increases at a rate of 20 percent each year. 
  She held that the biggest shadow on Sino-U.S. economic 
relations and trade is the U.S. annual review of MFN status for 
China. She stressed that if the United States continues to 
attach conditions to MFN, the consequences will be more serious. 
If the two sides confront each other, they will suffer and 
neither side will win. The delegation's visit to the United 
States fell on the eve of the U.S. Congress' debate over MFN 
status. It was a subtle and sensitive moment. On her visits to 
U.S. Vice President Gore, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, and 
National Economic Council Chairman Rubin, and Commerce Secretary 
Brown, she repeatedly stated China's position. 
  Wu Yi said: MFN status is purely a trade issue. We 
consistently oppose the linking of it with non-trade issues. If 
confrontation arises from this issue, then not only will 
Sino-U.S. economic relations be clouded in a shadow, but there 
also is the possibility they may break up. She said that China 
is fully prepared if the United States chooses to confront China 
and that China will not crumble without MFN status. 
  While 
in the United States, she always cited the Chinese saying to 
explain China's diversified market policy: "If there is no 
light in the east, there is light in the west. If there is 
darkness in the south, it will not be dark in the north." There 
now are 228 countries and regions that have economic relations 
and trade with Mainland China. Wu Yi said: "China's door has 
been opened to the whole world. It is impossible for anyone to 
close it." 
<H5>  An Economic Card </H5>
  Some media hold that during her U.S. trip, Wu Yi played a 
good "economic card": She headed a 200-person investment and 
trade delegation for the trip across the Pacific at the same 
time. The delegation -- which was comprised of high-ranking 
officials, experts, and entrepreneurs from the eight ministries 
and commissions of the State Council and from the 26 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions -- offered more than 800 
projects for negotiation. They launched large trade-promotion 
campaigns in Los Angeles and New York. It has been learned that 
the delegation was the largest ever sent to the United States by 
China. In the 10-day trade talks, at least $1.3 billion of 
contracts were signed and the total amount as stated in letters 
of intent exceeded $4 billion. 
  U.S. financial, industrial, and commercial circles responded 
enthusiastically. Various multinational corporations and 
medium-sized and small investors kept visiting, and a total of 
1,200 or more people participated in the trade talks. 
  Everyone knows that last year, more than 300 large U.S. 
corporations sent a joint letter to President Clinton, asking 
for the unconditional renewal of China's MFN status, ending the 
annual debate at an early date, and eliminating destabilizing 
factors. Since the end of the Cold War, the international 
macroclimate has developed in the direction of "economics and 
trade," and among corporations from around the world China has 
become a large market to scramble for. So far, of the 500 
largest corporations listed by FORTUNE, 52 have set up factories 
in China, and U.S. economic interests have been expanding 
continuously. Therefore, the call for the resolution of China's 
MFN status comes mainly from U.S. industrial and commercial 
circles. They were extremely interested in the MOFTEC 
minister's visit. 
  Moreover, many U.S. industrialists and businessmen know that 
Wu Yi was once an entrepreneur in charge of a large 
petrochemical company and that she has excellent expertise. On 
one occasion when she met IBM's new president in Beijing, her 
familiarity with and knowledge of IBM's business greatly 
surprised the guest, who exclaimed: "I am wondering if I am the 
IBM president or you." 
<H5>  Historical Opportunity for Sino-U.S. Economic and Trade </H5>
Cooperation 
  During the U.S. trip, Wu Yi paid a special visit to the 
McDonnell Douglas Corporation, and General Electric's president 
flew Wu Yi, head of the Chinese Government Economic and Trade 
Delegation, and Ye Qing, the deputy head and vice minister of 
the State Planning Commission, to its headquarters on a special 
plane. In their last day in New York, the U.S. top boss 
(Greenburgh) came to see her and held a farewell party for Wu Yi 
and her party, at which dozens of bosses of well-known U.S. 
corporations gathered, making the night a brilliant one. 
  Wu Yi placed a big order with the U.S. entrepreneurs: "In 
the next seven years, China's total imports will reach $1,000 
billion. China's emphases of development are in such areas as 
communications, telecommunications, and energy -- precisely 
those in which the United States has an advantage. U.S. 
economic circles are faced with a historical opportunity to 
develop Sino-U.S. economic cooperation." 
  Over the past four years, the U.S. Congress has been a major 
obstacle to the smooth extension of MFN status. In recent 
years, following large numbers of visits to China by congressmen 
and their assistants, plus the positive and effective lobbying 
of U.S. industrialists and businessmen, more and more 
congressmen have come to support the unconditional extension of 
China's MFN status. On the trip to the United States, Wu Yi met 
with more than 30 congressmen and was invited to the Congress, 
where debate was under way. According to data supplied by the 
Chinese Embassy in the United States, that was the first time a 
senior Chinese official had met so large a number of congressmen. 
<H5>  Effective Cooperation Will Create a Miracle </H5>
  Another reason Hong Kong and Macao were so concerned about 
Wu 
Yi's visits was because the popularity of this female minister 
is rapidly increasing in international economic circles. Since 
the end of 1991 when she, as the head of the Chinese 
representatives to the Sino-U.S. talks on intellectual property 
rights, finally succeeded in the nagging talks following an 
arduous battle of words, has been considered a strong rival in 
talks by Western countries, especially by the United States, 
which is the de facto controller of several major world economic 
organizations. Although she did not have to participate in 
talks as her duty during the delegation's visit to the United 
States, she demonstrated a frank, forthright, calm, and 
resourceful personal character in her contacts with government 
officials and entrepreneurs, and won many new friends. Her 
style has become a new image of openness of senior Chinese 
officials and is drawing increased attention. 
  She said: "The United States is the most developed country 
in the world. It possesses a great wealth of capital and 
advanced technology. China is the world's largest developing 
country and possesses a wealth of human resources and a 
practical and potential huge market. If China and the United 
States can achieve effective cooperation, then we believe that 
an economic miracle will be created."

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Merck and Co. Inc., of 
the U.S.A., one of the world's largest producers of medicines, 
has set up its first joint venture in China with Hangzhou 
Huadong Medicine Group Corporation. 
  The joint venture, the Hangzhou MSD Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, 
was formally established here on Wednesday [8 June]. Qi Moujia, 
the head of China's State Pharmaceutical Administration, cut a 
ribbon at the opening ceremony. 
  Qi said that he believed the joint venture would give great 
impetus to the development of China's pharmaceutical industry. 
  About 100 foreign-funded pharmaceutical companies have been 
set up since China's pharmaceutical industry opened to the 
outside world in 1978, he said. 
  Merck and Co has 16 production centers around the world, 
which are all called "MSD." It has been among America's ten 
best companies for years. Last year, its sales value exceeded 
10 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The total investment in the joint venture is over 26 million 
U.S. dollars, 75 percent of which comes from the American firm. 
The venture's contract has a 30-year term. 
  The joint venture will produce medicines to treat 
rheumatism, 
cardiovascular disease, prostate and other diseases, using 
Merck's patent technology. 
  It will use Merck's advanced management style as well as its 
science and technology. 
  All the products of the joint venture are intended for sale 
on the Chinese market, partly replacing imports of the same 
medicines. 
  The sales value of the joint venture is due to reach 3.5 
billion yuan (about 400 million U.S. dollars) within six years.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The Japanese Government 
released an annual report today calling for more aid for other 
Asian nations as a way to help revitalize the global economy. 
  Japan should contribute to the revitalization of the global 
economy by offering positive assistance to other Asian countries 
in their efforts to help themselves, while maintaining and 
expanding its own dynamic growth, said the white paper on 
economic cooperation for the fiscal year 1994. It added that 
Japan should expand its direct investment in and imports from 
other Asian countries. 
  The white paper, prepared by the International Trade and 
Industry Ministry, described the newly-industrializing economies 
(NIES) in Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) as "the growth center for world economic development." 
  The report consists of three parts -- current trends in the 
developing countries, countries aiming at further development 
through the utilization of the market mechanism and the 
expansion of dynamism in Asia. 
  It said that gross domestic product (GDP) last year in the 
developing countries showed a stable growth of 6.1 percent. The 
growth in Asia reached 8.4 percent, while favorable growth was 
observed in the Middle East and in Central and South America. 
  On the other hand, economic growth remained sluggish in 
Africa, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the report 
said. 
  It paid particular attention to China, Vietnam and India, 
devoting much space to analyzing various problems related to 
economic reform in these countries. 
  "China has achieved rapid growth again, as in the previous 
year, by gradually promoting reform and more open policies since 
the introduction of a market economy," the report said. 
  The country's trade and investment have expanded and inter- 
dependence with the world economy has deepened, especially in 
China's coastal areas. 
  But the paper noted that China still faced many problems, 
such as regional differences between the rapidly-growing coastal 
areas and the inland areas where the infrastructure is weak. 
  It said Japan's overseas aid in 1992 fell by 36.3 percent to 
15,944 million U.S. dollars, smooth growth in official 
development assistance (ODA) being more than offset by a 
substantial drop in private-sector aid. 
  Japan's ODA in 1992 totalled 11,332 billion dollars, making 
the country the top donor in the world for the second 
consecutive year, the report said.

  [Text] Tokyo, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- A delegation from the 
Chinese Ministry of Forestry headed by Forestry Minister Xu 
Youfang held talks on 7 June with a group of officials from the 
Japanese Environment Agency headed by the Agency's director 
general, Toshiko Hamayotsu. The two sides reached a consensus 
on cooperation in the protection of ibises, and signed a summary 
of talks on cooperation in the protection of ibises. 
  The summary of talks says: "The Chinese Ministry of Forestry 
and the Japanese Environmental Agency realize that the ibis is 
one of the bird species which is most near extinction, and to 
protect ibises and rescue them from the crisis of extinction is 
a problem for the Chinese people and the Japanese people to 
solve together." The summary says: To further strengthen 
cooperation between the two countries in the protection of 
ibises, the two sides have reached a consensus on the measures 
which could be adopted within the limits of the laws and 
regulations of their respective countries and their financial 
resources. The summary says: To support the Japanese side in 
the artificial breeding of ibises during the period of 
cooperation, the Chinese side will lend to the Japanese side a 
pair of healthy, reproductive ibises which are currently in the 
hands of the China Wild Life Protection Association. The birds 
will be loaned for a period of less than three years and be used 
in breeding and joint research. The Chinese side shall send the 
pair of ibises to Japan before 30 September 1994, and the 
Japanese side shall return the pair to China before October 1997. 
  The pair of birds are loaned for exclusive use by Japanese 
experts in breeding research. If the Japanese side extends an 
invitation, the Chinese side will consider sending experts to 
Japan to participate in the research. 
  Xu Youfang and his party arrived in Japan on 5 June on an 
eight- day good-will visit at the invitation of the Japanese 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. During their 
visit in Japan, Xu Youfang and his party have held talks with 
Japanese Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki 
Sato and Environment Agency Director General Toshiko Hamayotsu. 
They have also paid courtesy calls on Japanese upper house 
speaker Bunbe Hara and former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa.

  [Text] Washington, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter said today he and his wife will visit the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Republic of 
Korea (ROK) next week, according to a report reaching here from 
Atlanta. 
  During the visits, he hopes to discuss "some of the 
important 
issues of the day with leaders in the area," Carter said in a 
statement. 
  "As is the case with other international issues since 
leaving 
the White House, I have attempted to stay adequately briefed on 
the Korean situation," he said. 
  Carter noted that the initiative for his visit has been from 
Korea, not from Washington. "I will have no official status 
relating to the U.S. Government," he added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam said here today that his country will increase 
investment in China, which has now become the largest receiver 
of Seoul's overseas investment. 
  Kim made his remarks during a meeting with Wu Yi, Chinese 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, who arrived 
in Seoul on Tuesday [7 June] for a six-day visit to South Korea. 
  By the end of last year, South Korea's investment in China 
had reached 550 million U.S. dollars. 
  Kim said that he was happy to see the rapid development of 
Sino- South Korean relations since the two countries established 
diplomatic ties in August 1992. 
  He expressed the belief that Sino-South Korean cooperative 
relations will develop faster than ever in all fields. 
  On China rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade 
(GATT), Kim said that as a large country, membership in GATT 
will be conducive to China's development and beneficial to the 
rest of the world as well. 
  During the meeting Kim and Wu briefed each other on economic 
development in their countries. 
  Earlier this morning, Wu held talks with South Korean Trade, 
Industry and Resources Minister Kim Chol-su on bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation between China and South Korea.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren met with Yi Sang-ok, former foreign minister of the 
Republic of Korea (ROK), and his party here this morning. 
  During the meeting, Rong expressed appreciation for Yi's 
efforts in developing Sino-ROK relations when he was the ROK 
foreign minister. 
  Rong said that relations between China and ROK have been 
progressing fast and maintained a momentum of development since 
the two set up diplomatic links. 
  The exchanges of visits between leaders of the two countries 
have further promoted cooperation in the political and economic 
fields, Rong said. 
  The economies of the two countries were complementary and 
each has its own strength, Rong said. Therefore, bilateral 
cooperation enjoys great potential. 
  The Chinese vice-president stressed that developing Sino-ROK 
friendly relations is beneficial not only to the two countries, 
but also to peace and development in Asia. 
  Yi said that during his current visit, he had seen China's 
new economic development, which is of great significance to 
economic development in northeast Asia and in the world at large. 
  Yi said that he had done some work for developing bilateral 
relations when he was ROK foreign minister, and that he would 
continue to make efforts for the promotion of such relations. 
  Yi and his party arrived here on Tuesday [7 June] as guests 
of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA).

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China and South Korea 
will begin an exchange of public servants later this month for 
the first time, the South Korean Government Administration 
Ministry said here today. 
  South Korea plans to send 16 grade-five, working-level 
officials on June 28 to a three-week group training course for 
public servants offered by the Chinese Personnel Ministry. 
  China, in turn, will send 15 public officials to South Korea 
in early September to attend a training course at the central 
officials training institute here. 
  This exchange is based on an agreement signed last March to 
expand personnel cooperation between the two countries. 
  The ministry said the exchange is designed to promote 
friendly cooperation between civil servants by widening their 
knowledge of the other nation's reform policy.

  [Text] Moscow, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's press secretary today dismissed media reports of Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation as "fabrication and 
lies." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov in a statement this afternoon denied 
that 
President Yeltsin was planning to replace Chernomyrdin with 
former Russian Security Council Secretary Yuriy Skokov. 
  He said that the media reports about Yeltsin's meeting with 
Skokov on June 7 "were not in conformity with the facts." 
  Chernomyrdin's aides also issued a statement saying that the 
reports about the prime minister's resignation were "absolutely 
groundless." 
  "Spreading such rumors only serves certain elements and is 
exploiting the current situation," said the statement. 
  Opinion polls show that Chernomyrdin's reputation has been 
surging since early in the year. But speculation that 
Chernomyrdin will leave his post this autumn has been rife since 
he flew to Germany for a medical check-up on June 5. 
  The newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA today carried a 
front-page 
story saying that Skokov is going to replace Chernomyrdin as 
prime minister. 
  It quoted informed sources around the Russian cabinet as 
saying that the president's advisors have agreed in principle 
that after Chernomyrdin's resignation for health reasons is 
accepted, Skokov will be appointed prime minister. 
  Chernomyrdin seemed to have agreed to this arrangement 
before 
he flew suddenly to germany early this month, according to the 
newspaper. 
  The reports have created a furor at home and abroad. 
Chernomyrdin's aides immediately responded by issuing a 
statement in Germany saying that the prime minister would return 
to Moscow later today.

  [Text] Helsinki, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Estonian President 
Lennart-Georg Meri said today that trade between his country and 
China had a bright future and his people could learn much from 
China about establishing economic free trade zones. 
  He made the remarks in a written interview with XINHUA. The 
president is due to visit China between June 12-18. 
  He told XINHUA that he is aware that China is playing an 
increasingly important role in world politics. 
  Although the existing trading volume between China and 
Estonia is not big, the president said, he was satisfied with 
the bilateral relations, especially within the economic and 
trade sectors which are mutually beneficial. 
  Dozens of Chinese companies have already invested in Estonia 
and the Estonian business community is keen to reciprocate. 
  A delegation of estonian industrialists and businessmen will 
travel to China soon after President Meri's trip, seeking new 
cooperative opportunities. 
  According to the president, Estonia hopes to become China's 
trading gateway to the Nordic and Baltic countries as well as 
other European regions. 
  President Meri explained that Estonia was changing from a 
planned to a market economy and observing China's successful 
economic adjustment period could help his country achieve a 
smooth transition. 
  He said that Estonia will continue to carry out macro 
economic changes, land and agricultural reform and a 
privatization program. 
  In recent months the Estonian economy has been rising 
rapidly 
from its previous low point with export and foreign exchange 
reserves increasing remarkably. 
  Estonia's investment conditions are also improving and gross 
domestic production is expected to increase by six percent this 
year.

<F P=106> [Interview with King Norodom Sihanouk by correspondents (Li </F>
Bun) and (Yuan), on 6 June at his residence in Beijing -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [(Li Bun)] We are correspondents for China Radio 
International. 
  [Sihanouk] Please come in. [Words indistinct] [laughter]. 
  [(Li Bun)] We would like to thank Your Majesty for kindly 
granting us an interview despite your being very busy. We are 
very happy to see that Your Majesty is healthier and stronger. 
This is a source of pride for all Cambodian and Chinese people. 
  [Sihanouk] Thank you very much. I am this healthy because 
of the great benevolence of the PRC and all the ladies and 
gentlemen -- male and female doctors and nurses -- who are 
giving me the care and medical treatment to relieve me from my 
illnesses, which include cancer. It is also thanks to the great 
friendship and considerable scientific knowledge of the Chinese 
doctors and nurses who have given me the treatments on behalf of 
the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, His 
Excellency [H.E.] President Jiang Zemin, and the PRC Government. 
  For several months they have worked day and night to enable 
me to live longer for the sake of the sublime interest of the 
Cambodian nation and people, and so that I will be able to 
continue serving the correct cause of eternal and immortal 
friendship and fraternity between our two countries. We are 
fraternal countries which will always have great friendship, 
fraternity, and solidarity. Thank you. 
  [(Li Bun)] We believe that Your Majesty will have perfect 
health and a very long life. 
  [Sihanouk] Thank you very much for your great friendship and 
respect for me. 
  [(Li Bun)] I would like to beg permission to ask some 
questions. China and Cambodia have a long-standing bond of 
traditional friendship, especially since the Bandung Conference 
in 1955, under the joint efforts of Your Majesty and the Chinese 
leaders of all generations. The friendship between the two 
countries has been continuously enhanced and tested in all 
circumstances. What is your opinion concerning the basis for 
promoting the fraternal, friendly relations between the two 
countries and the future of this relationship between the two 
countries? Thank you. 
  [(Li Bun)] H.E. President Jiang Zemin has given a grand 
welcome for the official state visit I paid this week in the 
most glorious PRC, which is the greatest, most sincere, and 
oldest friend of our Cambodian people and nation. H.E. Jiang 
Zemin recalled that history shows that our two countries have 
established a bridge of friendship since time immemorial. In 
the Angkor era, the greatest era in Cambodia's history, there 
was close contact between our two peoples and nations. In the 
Angkor era, the Chinese philosopher Chou Ta-kuan paid a courtesy 
call on the Cambodian king and had close contact with the 
Cambodian people and stayed with them for a long time. He wrote 
to inform the Chinese people about Cambodian history, life and 
traditions of the Cambodian people and nation in that era. 
Later, I and H.E. Zhou Enlai reestablished the friendship as it 
was in the past. After the Bandung Conference, I had the great 
honor to pay an official state visit to the great Chinese state 
of the PRC. I had the great honor to call on H.E. Chairman Mao 
Zedong, and our friendship and cooperation has strengthened 
since then. 
  The PRC has given us so much help. We support one another in 
the international arena. In Cambodia's national reconstruction, 
the PRC has helped us all along in this effort, thus enabling 
our country to become very prosperous during the Sangkum Reas 
Niyum era, that is from 1955 to 1969. H.E. President Liu 
Shaoqi, H.E. Premier Zhou Enlai, H.E. Marshal Chen Yi, and H.E. 
Chairman Li Xiannian went personally to Cambodia to give us 
cooperation and assistance. Later, H.E. Deng Xiaoping, the 
esteemed chairman, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li 
Peng; H.E. Chairman Qiao Shi, and others have performed 
excellently in continuing the good traditions of friendship and 
cooperation with me and the Cambodian government. The PRC has 
helped us regain national reconciliation and security through 
the Paris Conference on Peace in Cambodia held in 1991. China 
has played a big role in that effort. Within the framework of 
the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], China also 
played a big role in helping Cambodia to achieve national 
reconciliation, peace, and the possibilities of rebuilding the 
nation. The Chinese people and nation have helped us in the 
national reconstruction to enable us to enjoy peace and 
prosperity following over two decades of war and misery. 
Throughout our life and the history of Cambodia, we will never 
forget this contribution of the PRC. We will always respect the 
PRC, which has made great contributions to us. 
  Therefore, the basis of our friendship is the fact that we 
know each other very well and respect each another like real 
brothers. The many Chinese people who have had family ties to 
Cambodia since time immemorial and those Cambodians with Chinese 
blood represent another good bridge of friendship that has 
always bound our two countries together. The common ideals of 
justice, progress, freedom, independence, and mutual trust -- 
the correct ideals for all mankind -- are the basis for what has 
always bound us together. 
  Another point is China's concern for the fate of Cambodia; 
they view it as the fate of the Chinese nation. China has 
always wanted Cambodia to enjoy prosperity and live forever with 
its independence and territorial integrity. We regard great 
China as our second motherland; that is, we love China 
wholeheartedly. We love each other without seeking to gain any 
personal benefit from each other; that is, we are honest with 
each other and are determined to defend our common ideals in the 
international arena and contribute to world peace and the 
development of various countries. 
  These are the major principles and the main basis that will 
always bind our countries together as great friends and brothers 
and will help to strengthen our cooperation and solidarity. 
  [(Li Bun)] [Words indistinct] the outcome of your visit? 
  [Sihanouk] First is the enhancement and consolidation of the 
basis for the traditional bonds of friendship and solidarity 
between our two countries, peoples, and nations, and between the 
leaders and governments of our two countries -- the PRC and the 
Kingdom of Cambodia. We decided to cooperate in all fields 
based on the ideals of friendship, fraternity, mutual trust, and 
mutual interest in defending our common ideals in the world. 
  Second, China -- that is, the respected PRC -- wants to 
honor 
me as a longstanding and faithful friend of nearly 40 years. In 
other words, because the Cambodian nation and people restored me 
as king of Cambodia, the PRC wants to express its highest 
consideration to the Cambodian king to show that it supports the 
Cambodian king for his loyal service to the nation. This 
service will enable Cambodia to achieve all the noble [words 
indistinct] peace, independence, and territorial integrity. 
  Third, the PRC today -- as in the past; since the 1950's and 
1960's -- wants to show its sincere desire to help Cambodia. It 
wants to help so that Cambodia can enjoy peace and prosperity 
through national reconstruction. The PRC has given Cambodia 
aid. When the two Cambodian prime ministers paid an official 
visit recently at the amiable invitation of H.E. Premier Li 
Peng, the PRC gave an additional sum of aid to the Cambodian 
nation. H.E. Jiang Zemin has said the PRC will continue to help 
us. 
  Finally is the knowledge that the Cambodian delegation and 
I... [pauses] Cambodia has learned from the overall prosperity 
the PRC has accomplished under the leadership of H.E. Chairman 
Deng Xiaoping, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, and the CPC. They 
have set a good example for the Third World -- including 
Cambodia -- on how to carry out reforms and modernization; how 
to make contact with the outside world; how to build and make 
the country prosperous; and especially how to make progesss in 
the fields of the economy, industry, public works, justice, and 
so on. The progress the PRC has made over the past few years 
(?is an encouragement to) Cambodia and people around the world. 
It is a big lesson for us. 
  I was greatly encouraged by the leaders of the Chinese 
nation 
and people; that is, H.E. President Jiang Zemin, H.E. Premier Li 
Peng, and H.E. NPC [National People's Congress] Chairman Qiao 
Shi. They met with me and said on behalf of the PRC that they 
support (?King) Sihanouk in his efforts to seek a basis for 
building the nation and making it prosper quickly. That basis 
is peace; that basis is to achieve national reconciliation, 
solve national problems, end the war, institute a cease-fire, 
and settle all disputes and conflicts between the Royal 
Government of Cambodia and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea 
through peaceful means. We must only use peaceful means. Their 
excellencies the PRC leaders and I are of the same opinion and 
views; 100 percent. This is a great encouragement to me. I 
feel greatly encouraged by the PRC leaders, who share my view 
that this matter must be resolved quickly so that the time for 
national construction is not wasted. We must only use peaceful 
means. It is a [words indistinct] I highly value my intimate 
and fraternal conversations with H.E. President Jiang Zemin, 
H.E. Premier Li Peng, and H.E. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi. Thank you. 
  [(Li Bun)] [Question indistinct] 
  [Sihanouk] I think that this reply will be in accordance 
with 
the desire to know. 
  [(Li Bun)] Your Majesty, we at the international radio have 
enjoyed the support and encouragement of Your Majesty and the 
Cambodian people. This has encouraged us to continue striving 
to serve the friendship between Cambodia and China. 
  [Sihanouk] I would like to take this auspicious occasion to 
express my respect, admiration, commendation, and gratitude to 
our Chinese brothers and sisters in the national radio, 
television, and press sectors who have given us immense support. 
This is because the PRC's radio, television, and press have 
genuine might and prestige in the national and international 
arenas. They have helped to disseminate information -- not only 
inside great China but also in the international arena -- on the 
Cambodian situation; developments, problems, and the efforts of 
the Cambodian people and nation toward national construction and 
defense. They have helped the international community come to 
know and understand us well. Therefore, I would like to express 
my heartfelt and deep respect, commendation, and gratitude to 
all our Chinese friends -- brothers and sisters -- who are 
members of the PRC's national radio, press, and television. 
Thank you. 
  [(Li Bun)] Thank you.

  [Text] Johannesburg, June 9 (XINHUA)-- Greg Mills, director 
of studies at the South African Institute of International 
Affairs, said in an article published in `THE STAR' here today 
that South Africa should sever ties with Taiwan and establish 
diplomatic relations with China. 
  After the first democratic elections in South Africa, it is 
not a matter of if, but when and how South Africa will sever 
ties with its trading partner Taiwan and establish diplomatic 
relations with China, Greg Mills said. 
  The article said South Africa's ties with Taiwan began in 
1977 when Pretoria sought new allies and trading partners in the 
wake of the Soweto uprisings and the United Nations arms embargo. 
  The article said: `In the throes of its own deepening 
isolation, Taiwan, on the other hand, saw the opportunity as 
providing a further anti-communist ally as well as an expansion 
of trade.' 
  `South Africa's trade with China grew by 170 percent between 
1992-93, and it is expected to double again this year. Also the 
People's Republic of China is alleged to have been one of the 
major gold buyers in recent times with about 25 percent of the 
world's total (population),' the article added. 
  `Simply put, given the political and economic realities of 
the situation, South Africa does not have any options.' 
  The article further stated dual recognition was a 
non-starter. 
  `The need to make alternative arrangements with Taiwan 
should 
not delay a decision on the central political issue. Any 
unnecessary delays or crude attempts to devise unique solutions 
will only temporarily avoid the inevitable and anger Beijing,' 
Greg Mills said.

and its stand opposing foreign interference, which speaks highly 
of Zaireans' efforts to overcome difficulties and resume 
national stability.

its 
stability and development will be of great importance to Central 
Africa and the whole continent. 
  Qian pointed out that dramatic changes in the international 
situation has brought many new difficulties and problems to 
Africa. 
  Meanwhile, he said, they also stimulate the African people's 
new awakening. 
  Qian noted that more and more African countries have come to 
realize that their common aspirations are to oppose foreign 
interference, safeguard political stability and seek economic 
development. 
  He said it is of great importance for African countries and 
other developing countries to strengthen unity and cooperation. 
  The Chinese Government supports African countries' efforts 
toward the realization of peace and development on the continent. 
  Qian asked Ngbanda to convey the Chinese leaders' greetings 
to Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko. 
  During the meeting Ngbanda conveyed a letter from President 
Mobutu to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, adding that Zaire and 
China have a very good relationship and that it is his hope that 
such ties will grow in a wide range of areas. 
  Wang Changyi, Chinese assistant foreign minister, attended 
the meeting.

the 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China (BOC) 
issued bonds worth 300 million Deutsche mark recently in the 
Frankfurt international capital market in Germany. 
  The five-year bonds carry an interest rate of 7.125 percent, 
and were sold to underwriters at a price 101.425 percent of the 
face value, a BOC spokesman said. 
  It was the third time since 1988 for the BOC to issue 
Deutsche mark-denominated bonds in international financial 
markets. 
  The BOC spokesman said that the fact that the interest rate 
of the Deutsche mark hit its record lowest point had been 
conducive to the bond issue. 
  The Commercial Bank of Germany served as the lead manager 
for 
BOC, and the underwriting group consisted of 29 banks and 
securities companies from Europe, Japan and the U.S.A. 
  The BOC has floated bonds in foreign currencies three times 
so far this year: once each in the U.S., Japan and Germany, 
netting capital totalling 830 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
member and Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee secretary, wound 
up a fruitful visit to Germany last week. 
  This reporter interviewed Comrade Xie Fei over the telephone 
on Guangdong-German economic cooperation prospects. 
  After winding up a fruitful visit to Germany and Denmark, 
the 
Guangdong Provincial Economic Investigation Delegation headed by 
Xie Fei, arrived back in Guangzhou last week. 
  In Germany, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had invited 
Comrade Xie Fei to visit Germany, held a banquet in honor of 
Comrade Xie Fei and his entourage in Bonn. The two sides held 
cordial talks on expanding friendly relations of cooperation 
between China and Germany, especially between Guangdong and 
Germany. 
  In Germany, Comrade Xie Fei and his entourage had extensive 
contacts with personages from Germany's industrial, commercial, 
and banking circles, and held talks with entrepreneurs and 
financiers from the German Industrial and Economic Federation, 
Berlin Industrial and Commercial Federation, and Bremen 
Industrial and Commercial Federation and with chief executives 
of Germany's (BAOMA) Joint-Stock Company, Siemens Company, and 
(JINMAKE) Company. Comrade Xie Fei briefed German friends on 
Guangdong's economic development, investment environment, and 
projects awaiting foreign investment. Comrade Xie Fei also held 
conscientious trade talks with the German friends. 
  People of all walks of life in Germany expressed profound 
appreciation of as well as interest in the excellent economic 
cooperation opportunities offered by Guangdong. 
  After the Guangdong delegation returned to Guangzhou from 
Germany, this reporter interviewed Comrade Xie Fei on what 
Guangdong should do to expand economic cooperation with Germany. 
  During the interview, Comrade Xie Fei told this reporter: 
Germany's advanced science, technology, managerial expertise, as 
well as high economic efficiency are useful to Guangdong's 
modernization drive. Guangdong should, in the years ahead, 
strive to expand economic cooperation with Germany in four main 
areas. 
  [Begin Xie Fei recording] We should expand economic 
cooperation with Germany in light of Guangdong's actual 
conditions. To this end, first and foremost, we should expand 
Guangdong-German economic cooperation in a number of selected 
areas, such as enterprise management, communications, 
telecommunication, environmental protection, and so on, in which 
Germany has excelled. We should also set up more joint venture 
enterprises with Germany and invite more capital from Germany. 
Second, we should study and draw on Germany's advanced capital 
construction experiences with an eye to upgrading Guangdong's 
capital construction and large-scale modern production. To this 
end, we should send more personnel to Germany to learn relevant 
expertise. I believe that we will be able to learn a great deal 
from Germany in many areas. Third, we should forge closer 
bilateral trade ties with Germany on the basis of enhanced 
mutual understanding, hold more trade promotion fairs, and carry 
out more similar activities in Germany to make it more 
convenient for the German businesspeople and entrepreneurs to 
come to and invest in Guangdong. Germany has a large number of 
small and medium-sized enterprises engaging in modern 
production. These German enterprises have expressed profound 
interest in investing in Guangdong. We should try to provide 
German entrepreneurs with more and better services and 
sufficient information in this regard, and invite them to come 
to have a look at Guangdong's investment environment with their 
own eyes. Fourth, we should provide more cooperation projects 
for and hold more trade talks with the German business community 
and expand cooperation with German financial and banking 
circles. Germany has agreed to provide more loans on 
preferential terms to help Guangdong build environmental 
protection projects. I can foresee great potential in this area 
of bilateral cooperation. We should strive to improve work in 
this connection. In a nutshell, in my view, it is all the more 
necessary for Guangdong to expand cooperation with and learn 
more from Germany, as well as other advanced countries in the 
world. We should strive to expand pluralistic opening up to the 
outside world and make redoubled efforts to step up economic 
cooperation in depth and breadth with all advanced countries in 
the world. Only by so doing will we finally optimize 
Guangdong's industrial structure. I'm full of confidence about 
the Guangdong-Germany economic cooperation. 
  Last year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited Guangdong, at 
which 
time we discussed a host of trade and cooperation issues. I 
believe that we should take last year's visit to Guangdong as a 
point of departure and strive to make every possible endeavor to 
push forward bilateral trade and cooperation. Since last year, 
Guangdong has sent many a delegation to Germany and forged 
extensive ties with the German business community. The recent 
visit to Germany has undoubtedly enhanced our confidence in the 
Guangdong-Germany cooperation in the years ahead. [end recording]

prospects for Sino-Maltese friendly cooperation through joint 
efforts of the two sides. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Relations between China and Malta are

exchanges have been very fruitful, and the two sides are 
actively exploring specific channels for further economic and 
trade cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
"It has been proven by facts that countries, whether big or 
small and whether sharing similar social systems or not, may 
coexist in a friendly manner as well as forge mutual and 
beneficial cooperation as long as the two countries adopt the 
spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences and 
the spirit of mutual respect." 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: "We are satisfied with the development 
of relations between the two countries, and we believe that 
there are bright prospects for Sino-Maltese friendly cooperation 
through joint efforts of the two sides." 
  Speaking about his impression of his visit to China, Prime 
Minister Adami said that he is deeply impressed with China's 
tremendous achievements in economic construction. He said: 
Maltese-Chinese relations have maintained good and fruitful 
cooperation for many years. He deeply believed that his visit 
would further consolidate these relations. 
  During the meeting, Adami conveyed President Bonnici's 
greetings and invitation to visit Malta to President Jiang 
Zemin. Jiang Zemin thanked him and asked Prime Minister Adami 
to convey his greetings to President Bonnici. 
  The guests and hosts also exchanged opinions on issues of 
common concern during the meeting, which was held in a friendly 
atmosphere. 
  Participants in the meeting included Zhao Weizhi, vice 
chairman of the Jiusan (September 3) Society Central Committee;

cooperation; and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.

  [Text] Lima, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori has said that cooperation between China and Peru has 
been effective and enjoys vast potentials for further 
development. 
  In an interview with XINHUA prior to his visit to China, 
Fujimori said that his forthcoming China tour will promote 
bilateral economic cooperation and exchanges and that relations 
between the two countries will be further strengthened. 
  Fujimori and his accompanying delegation left here early 
today for visits to Japan and China. 
  Fujimori's forthcoming China tour will be his third since he 
became Peruvian president in 1990. The previous two visits to 
China took place in April and November 1991. 
  Both visits have greatly promoted the development of 
relations between the two countries, particularly bilateral 
cooperation and trade, the president said. 
  China has provided a lot of assistance to Peru which also 
purchased from China farm machinery and teaching equipment, thus 
meeting the needs of its agricultural and educational sectors, 
he said. 
  He noted that there exist vast potentials yet to be tapped 
in 
cooperation in these two fields. 
  With his third visit to China, the two countries will have 
wider cooperation and more exchanges on a much larger scale, the 
president said. 
  As the economies of the two countries continue to develop 
and 
become mutually supplementary, bilateral trade will be further 
increased, he added. 
  The president appreciated China's policy of non-interference 
in other nation's internal affairs and its stands for 
international cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- President Alberto 
Fujimori of the Republic of Peru called for better links with 
China's civil aviation and other industries here today. 
  In a meeting with Zhu Yuli, general manager of the Aviation 
Industries of China, and Liu Guomin, president of the China 
National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC), 
Fujimori said that Peru and China have cooperated well in this 
field, adding that the nine Yun-12 transport planes Peru has 
imported from China have been placed into normal operations and 
seem fit for Peruvian conditions. 
  Both fujimori and Zhu agreed that a still greater potential 
is yet to be developed in the civil aviation industry and other 
economic sectors. 
  An agreement was recently signed between CATIC and the 
relevant Peruvian department on CATIC providing 31 million U.S. 
dollars worth of road-building machinery to Peru develop its

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Relations between China 
and Peru have progressed so well that Peru has become China's 
fourth largest trade partner in Latin America. 
  This point was made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin when he 
had a two-hour talk here today with visiting Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori. 
  The two presidents pledged to push bilateral relations to a 
new height. After their talks, China gave Peru a 39.1 million 
U.S. dollar export credit. 
  Fujimori, who is here for a four-day state visit, previously 
visited China in April 1991, and in the same year paid a transit 
visit to Shenzhen in November. 
  Welcoming Fujimori, Jiang said: "We are happy to see the 
great achievements that the Peruvian Government and people have 
made in maintaining political stability and in promoting 
economic development, under your leadership." 
  Jiang said that China and Peru enjoy traditional friendship. 
In recent years, he said, that the frequent exchanges of 
high-level visits between the two countries have further 
enhanced bilateral understanding. 
  Jiang said that the friendly cooperative relations between 
the two countries in various areas have been developing smoothly 
in recent years, adding that bilateral trade volume has been 
increasing annually and now Peru has become China's No. 4 trade 
partner in Latin America. 
  Jiang, expressing satisfaction with bilateral economic and 
technological cooperation, said that China is willing to expand 
such mutually beneficial cooperation in different forms, and 
that it encourages Chinese enterprises to invest in Peru and 
Peruvian ones are also welcome in China. 
  Fujimori agreed with Jiang's views. He said that Chinese 
products were suitable for Peru, and that Peru would like to 
expand bilateral trade and wants to take in more Chinese 
technology and welcomes Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Peru. 
  He thanked China for its assistance and the favored 
treatment 
China offers in bilateral trade. 
  Fujimori said that Peru values its relations with China -- 
the only country to which he has paid two state visits. 
  Fujimori voiced support for China's entry into the 
Pan-American Development Bank, saying that China's entry will be 
conducive to trade cooperation between China, Peru and other 
Latin American countries. 
  After the talks, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen and Goldenberg Schreiber, president of Council of 
Ministers and minister of foreign affairs of Peru, signed two 
agreements: A Sino-Peruvian consular agreement and an agreement 
on encouragement and mutual protection of investment between 
China and Peru. 
  At the same ceremony, Wang Xuebing, president of the Bank of 
China, signed with Goldenburg an agreement for China to provide 
Peru with a 39.1 million U.S. dollar export credit. 
  Before the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony welcoming 
Fujimori to visit China.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and visiting Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori here today 
pledged to further develop friendly relations of cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  During their meeting here this afternoon, both Li and 
Fujimori expressed satisfactions over the smooth development of 
Sino-Peruvian relations. 
  Li said that yesterday Fujimori and Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin had "very good talks and reached consensus on a series of 
issues." He believed that Fujimori's current visit would play a 
positive role in furthering Sino-Peruvian ties. 
  The economies of China and Peru are mutually complementary 
and their products are suitable to each other, Li said, 
therefore, the two countries enjoy great potential in developing 
bilateral trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefits. 
  The Chinese premier said that both China and Peru are 
developing countries and they share similar views on issues of 
human rights and democracy. 
  Li expressed thanks for Peru's support to China at world's 
human rights conferences. He also expressed appreciations of 
Peru's support for China's re-entry into GATT as a signatory 
state and for China's application to join in the Pan-American 
Development Bank. 
  "We are delighted to notice that the debt burden for Latin 
American countries has been eased up recently and that Peru's 
economy has been developing steadily," the premier said. 
  Li noted that exchanges between China and Latin American 
countries have been increasing year by year in politics, 
economy, and culture and they have the common aspiration to 
develop cooperation. 
  While recalling his last two visits to China, Fujimori said 
that his three visits to China have enhanced mutual 
understanding and promoted bilateral economic and trade 
relations. 
  Fujimori agreed to Li's view that the economies of the two 
countries are complementary to each other. 
  The Peruvian president said that Peru and China share 
similar 
views on many international issues, and both oppose interference 
in other nation's internal affairs by means of human rights and 
democracy. 
  He stressed that the common positions of the two countries 
on 
political issues serve as the foundation for the further 
development of bilateral economic and trade relations.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Hu Qinghai (5170 3237 3189)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Supervision called a 
telephone conference of discipline inspection and supervision 
departments nationwide in Beijing today, calling for deepening 
the anticorruption drive and concentrating efforts to 
investigate and handle major and serious cases. 
  Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau and the 
Secretariat and secretary of the Discipline Inspection 
Commission of the CPC Central Committee, addressed the 
conference. He said: Party committees and governments, as well 
as discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels 
should continue to earnestly carry out the three tasks of the 
anticorruption drive in line with the party Central Committee's 
plans. Currently it is necessary to pay particular attention to 
intensifying investigation of major and serious economic 
offenses involving leading officials at and above the county and 
section levels. Meanwhile, it is necessary to halt all kinds of 
malpractice and corruption adversely affecting the progress of 
reforms, economic growth, and stability; and to strive to deepen 
the anticorruption drive and make it a still greater success. 
  According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, 
discipline inspection and supervision organs nationwide received 
a total of 366,000 tips from the masses, completed the 
investigation of 14,718 cases, placed an additional 22,981 cases 
on file for investigation, and disciplined 15,216 party and 
government officials. These officials included 450 county or 
section-level, 35 prefectural or department-level, and 3 
provincial or ministerial-level cadres. Of the 15,216 
officials, 1,416 were handed over to judicial departments for 
prosecution on criminal charges. Through investigating and 
handling discipline violation cases, a total of 642 million yuan 
in economic losses were recovered for the state. 
  Wei Jianxing said: Despite some successes in the 
anticorruption drive, there remain a number of problems which 
must not be overlooked, and which must be resolved by taking 
effective measures. 
  He emphasized: We must further strengthen the leadership 
over handling of cases and must conclude the investigation of a 
number of major cases within the next few months. He said: All 
localities and departments should work out plans and take 
action, concentrating attention on major cases involving 
economic offenses, such as embezzlement, bribery, financial 
frauds, smuggling, and serious violations of financial and 
economic discipline. Leading departments of the party and 
government, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement 
departments, and economic administrative departments should 
remain the main targets; while investigation should be focused 
on major and serious economic offenses by leading cadres at and 
above the county and section levels. 
  He said: While investigating major and serious cases, it is 
also necessary to pay keen attention to the work related to 
leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline, and correction of 
style. As far as the work related to honesty and 
self-discipline is concerned, efforts should be concentrated on 
self-examination and correction by leading cadres. Where a 
department or locality has failed to convene a democratic 
meeting to examine leading cadres' honesty and self-discipline, 
it is necessary to promptly do so. Where such a meeting has 
been convened, it is necessary to report the meeting results as 
they really are to cadres and people at large, and to accept 
their evaluation and supervision. Problems which have been 
revealed during the self-examination or investigation should be 
promptly corrected and handled according to regulations. He 
said: The main targets of correction this year should be focused 
on screening of wanton collection of fees, investigating use of 
government funds to go on sight-seeing tours outside the country 
(territory), and checking power abuse by party and government 
organs and their functionaries in using enterprise money and 
materials free of charge, and halting salient malpractice in 
various departments, trades, and professions. 
  Meanwhile, he emphasized: We should coordinate various 
forces to review progress of the anticorruption drive and 
earnestly supervise and inspect the implementation of the three 
tasks, especially the progress in investigating major and 
serious cases, thereby deepening the anticorruption drive. 
  State Councillor Li Guixian spoke on the need by various 
departments and governments at all levels to step up efforts to 
correct unhealthy practices in various trades and professions 
and promote the construction of clean government. 
  Responsible persons from the relevant departments attended 
the conference.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive News": "Qian Qichen Reportedly To Resign March </F>
Next Year, His Post To Be Taken Over by Luo Gan"] 
  [Text] According to well-informed sources in Beijing, the 
Chinese top leadership is preparing major personnel changes in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Current Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen may resign from the office in March next year and Luo 
Gan, current secretary general of the State Council, may take 
over the post. It is also said that Wu Jianmin, current 
director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department, will be 
transferred to the Netherlands and named Chinese ambassador to 
that country. Chen Jian, China's deputy representative to the 
United Nations, may take over Wu Jianmin's current post. 
  The informed sources in Beijing said that Luo Gan has 
recently appeared on more diplomatic occasions and that this was 
irrelevant to his current duties as secretary general of the 
State Council. Therefore, it is believed that the central 
leadership is making preparations for transferring him to the 
foreign ministry. 
  However, diplomatic circles in Beijing are doubtful about 
the 
appointment of Luo Gan as foreign minister. An official who has 
good knowledge about the operation of China's foreign affairs 
system said that Luo Gan is Premier Li Peng's right-hand man, 
but Luo has no foreign affairs experience. It will be difficult 
to convince people if he is named foreign minister. 
  He said: At present, in the State Council, Li Peng takes 
charge of foreign affairs. The rumor about the transfer of Luo 
Gan to the Foreign Ministry may be related to Li Peng's 
intention to strengthen his control over the ministry. As Zhu 
Rongji is now in charge of economic affairs in the State 
Council, it is normal that Li Peng wants to designate his own 
right-hand man to control the Foreign Ministry. 
  Qian Qichen, who is now rumored to resign from office, is 66 
years of age. He was born in Jiading, Jiangsu (now in 
Shanghai). He was a second secretary at the Chinese embassy in 
the Soviet Union in 1955 and then in succession became director 
of the Education Ministry Student Affairs Section, deputy 
director of the Education Ministry Foreign Affairs Department, 
counsellor at the Chinese embassy in the Soviet Union, 
ambassador to Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, director of the Foreign 
Ministry Information Department, and vice minister of foreign 
affairs. In 1988, he became foreign minister and in 1991, he 
became state councillor and concurrently foreign minister. 
Inside the CPC, he was elected alternate member of the 12th CPC 
Central Committee and became full member of the Central 
Committee at the party's national conference of party delegates; 
at the 13th party congress, he was again elected a member of the 
Central Committee; and at the 14th party congress, he was 
elected a member of the Central Committee Political Bureau. 
  Luo Gan, 59, was born in Jinan, Shandong. He was a research 
group leader in the First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry 
Machinery Research Institute in 1960 and then successively 
became deputy director of the Machinery Science Research 
Institute in Zhengzhou City, deputy director of the Henan 
Provincial Import and Export Management Commission, director of 
the Henan Provincial Science and Technology Commission, vice 
governor of Henan Province, and secretary of the Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee. He was then appointed minister of 
labor in 1988 and secretary general of the State Council in the 
same year. He was vice chairman and a member of the secretariat 
of the 10th National Federation of Trade Unions and deputy 
chairman of the Executive Council of the Foundry Branch of the 
Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society. At the 12th CPC 
National Congress, he was elected alternate member of the 
Central Committee; at the 13th and 14th party congresses, he was 
elected a member of the Central Committee. 
  Wu Jianmin, 55, was born in Chongqing, Sichuan. After 
graduating from Number Two Middle School, Nanjing, in 1955, he 
studied in the French Language Department of the Beijing Foreign 
Languages College. In 1961, he was sent by the Communist Youth 
League Central Committee to Budapest as a French interpreter for 
the Chinese representative to the World Democratic Youth 
Federation. He returned to China in 1965. In his 30-year 
diplomatic career he worked in the UN headquarters for about 10 
years and with the Chinese delegation to the United Nations on 
two occasions. He first worked there in the early 1970's as 
third secretary and second secretary and was responsible for 
Middle East and Southern African affairs. 
  In 1979, Wu Jianmin was transferred to the Chinese People's 
Institute of Foreign Affairs and took charge of European affairs 
and protocol affairs. Four years after that, he returned to the 
foreign ministry and worked with the political research group. 
On 21 March 1991, Wu Jianmin appeared for the first time in his 
capacity as spokesman at a routine foreign ministry news 
briefing, which was held in the Beijing International Club. 
  Wu Jianmin's wife Shi Yanhua is currently director of the 
translation office in the foreign ministry. She graduated from 
the English Department of Beijing Foreign Languages College and 
was assigned to work with the foreign ministry education 
department translation section on graduation. Between the late 
1970's and the early 1980's, Shi Yanhua was Deng Xiaoping's 
interpreter at almost all meetings with important U.S. officials.

<F P=106> [Article by Hsiao Hsueh (5618 7185): "From Tycoon to the </F>
Vice President of the State -- Story of Rong Yiren's Political 
Career"] 
  [Text] Rong Yiren is simply a concise modern history of 
China. 
  By the middle of this century, the Rong family had more than 
20 cotton mills, dyeing factories, and flour mills, and was the 
"richest" in national industry and commerce. Foreign media 
called the Rong family the "Rockefellers" of China. 
  The Rong family originally became from Wuxi in eastern 
China. 
Of the Rong family, Mr. Rong Desheng and Mr. Rong Zongjing were 
enterprise pioneers. Rong Desheng was the father of Rong Yiren. 
In February 1896, the Rong brothers set up the Guangsheng 
Private Bank at Shanghai's Xiongsheng Wharf with a capital of 
3,000 yuan. In their business, they were prudent with every 
word and action, and went about things steadily. This has 
continued in the Rong family and has become the key to their 
devotion to and the success of their enterprise. 
  The time the Rong family really made a fortune was when they 
began the flour business and the textile business. 
  In 1902, the Baoxing Flour Mill, the first enterprise in 
which the Rong brothers invested, began business. Despite 
difficulties, they finally set up 12 flour mills under the names 
of Maoxin and Fuxin, and 10 cotton mills under the name of 
Shenxin, as well as their largest industry -- the Kaiyuan 
Machine Factory -- thus supporting the national industry and 
commerce in completely devastated old China. 
  Unexpectedly, the war against the Japanese broke out. After 
taking Shanghai, the Japanese aggressors broke into wanton 
massacre and looting. The Rongs' enterprises were mostly 
ruined, looted, and occupied. Mr. Rong Zongjing was so 
infuriated at this that he had a relapse and died in Hong Kong 
in 1938. Mr. Rong Desheng then took over the Rong family's 
business in Shanghai. 
  The worst blow to the Rong family was the "kidnapping of 
Rong 
Desheng" in 1946. Some comments held that the most noted 
kidnapping in modern world history was the kidnapping and murder 
of the son of the American pilot hero Lindbergh. In modern 
Chinese history, however, the most noted kidnapping was that of 
the Shanghai tycoon Rong Desheng in 1946. 
  Rong Desheng, born in 1875, was the father of Rong Yiren. He 
was already 71 when kidnapped. He was locked up by kidnappers 
for 34 days. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of $1 million, 
but they finally agreed to $500,000. In those days, $500,000 
was somewhere between $5 million and $7 million today. 
  Following the incident, the entire Rong family was anxious, 
not knowing who might be the next to encounter misfortune in a 
time and a world where there was no difference between policemen 
and criminals. In order to avoid another misfortune, Rong Yiren 
went to study in the United States, yet he lived in constant 
fear. 
  On the eve of liberation, many capitalists in Shanghai left. 
Rong Yiren and his father also felt extremely confused. They 
had very little understanding of the Communist Party and the 
Liberation Army, though they had heard many rumors about them. 
Rong Desheng told Rong Yiren that whatever might happen he 
would never leave and that he wished to spend his remaining 
years in his home town. 
  As his father had decided not to leave, Rong Yiren became 
increasingly hesitant, at a loss for what to do. Seeing this, 
his wife, Yang Jianqing, asked someone to rent an apartment for 
them in Hong Kong so they could move to Hong Kong in case of 
"emergency." 
  Nonetheless, Rong Yiren and his father did not leave in the 
end. Rong Desheng thought to himself that China was, after all, 
good for the Chinese. Rong Yiren thought: The communists at 
their worst could be no worse than the Kuomintang [KMT]! As 
they hesitated, Shanghai was liberated. 
<H5>  Invited to Beijing To Discuss the Tax Reform Issue, Rong </H5>
Yiren Boldly Says: "It Is You Who Invited Me. I Can Remain 
Absolutely Silent If You Don't Want Me To Say Anything." 
  Rong Yiren recalled, saying: "On 25 May 1949, the Liberation 
Army entered Shanghai. I was 33 then. I remember that I drove 
a car on the street and saw PLA soldiers lying on the sides of 
the street and not disturbing anyone at all. My car pulled up 
and a PLA soldier told me, with a polite and honest attitude, 
not to cross over because fighting was still going on up ahead 
and it was not safe. That was the first time I had met a PLA 
soldier, and he was completely different from a KMT soldier. 
  "In early June, the city's military control meeting asked me 
to go over for a meeting," recalled Rong Yiren. "At the 
meeting, I met Chen Yi, Zeng Shan, Pan Hannian, and other 
leaders. That day, when Sheng Kangnian and Jin Oubu saw me, 
they introduced Comrade Xu Dixin to me. Comrade Chen Yi 
announced that the party's policy was to allow industrialists 
and businessmen to restore their businesses without worry. He 
said that they should continue their factory and shop 
operations, and that if they had difficulties, they could go and 
ask for help from the party and the government. He also said 
that the party and the government meant what they said. As I 
heard this, I thought to myself that this was a good policy. 
Although I doubted whether the government could resolve 
problems, I felt that I had to continue my business anyway and 
that I would not care until it was in trouble. Therefore, I 
went back to the company and arranged for the restoration of 
work." 
  "Between April and May 1950, Beijing called a national 
work conference on the tax issue. Industrialists and 
businessmen were invited to send representatives to it. I 
headed for the conference. Industrialists and businessmen had 
never been invited to a meeting on the tax issue before. 
Central leaders Comrade Chen Yun (then Financial Committee 
director) and Bo Yibo (then Finance Minister) presided over the 
meeting. At the meeting, I expressed the opinion of 
industrialists and businessmen regarding the questions of 
taxation and of readjusting tax rates. I was young then and 
said too much. A tax bureau head told me that I said too much! 
I retorted: "It is you who invited me. I can remain 
absolutely silent if you don't want me to say anything." The 
atmosphere suddenly got tense. Comrade Bo Yibo said: "We have 
invited industrialists and businessmen to express their views. 
It is not right if we don't let them say anything." He asked 
me to keep my temper. Gu Huai, director of the Shanghai Tax 
Bureau, told me later that after hearing my words, the party 
held an overnight meeting and made criticisms and that they 
could not go to sleep. I knew from this that the party really 
sincerely solicited views from us businessmen, attached great 
importance to and seriously considered our views, and that they 
were realistic and acted on good choices -- all for reviving the 
national economy." 
  In October 1955, the National Alliance of Industrialists and 
Businessmen called a meeting of executive members. Rong Yiren 
came to Beijing to participate in it. Mao Zedong also came and 
presided over a discussion meeting in person. The meeting 
lasted approximately two hours in an earnest and sincere 
atmosphere. The "capitalists" said: "We must be a little more 
farsighted. We must not fear socialism. We must hold our fate 
in our hands and must not be perturbed." Mao Zedong then told 
the story of Xiao Guiying, a character in the Beijing opera 
theme the "Fisherman for the Revolution." He said: "Xiao 
Guiying went to join in the revolution, but he did not forget to 
lock his door because he feared that his pitchers and kettles 
would be stolen. Industrialists and businessmen are not like 
this. They must be a little more farsighted." That was the eve 
of the high tide of public-and-private cooperation in joint 
ventures throughout the country. Mao Zedong's sincere words 
gave lots of food for thought. He said: "If one really works 
for the people, really offers help the people, and does good 
things for them consistently when they are in difficulty, the 
people and the people's government will have no reason to desert 
him and no reason not to give him an opportunity to earn a 
living and to make contributions." 
  After the discussion meeting, Rong Yiren felt he was greatly 
inspired. On his return to Shanghai, he made a guarantee to the 
Shanghai People's Congress, saying: "I surely will invest in 
enterprises and purchase public bonds with the profits I have 
made to support the country's development." 
  Rong Yiren remained in Shanghai for a very long time 
following liberation, but the financial situation of this city 
could be reflected to Zhongnanhai almost every day. In January 
1957, Shanghai called the first session of the Second People's 
Congress. Chen Yi, who had previously been the Shanghai mayor 
and now worked as vice premier of the State Council, went from 
Beijing to Shanghai and delivered a sensational speech. 
  Marshall Chen Yi said in a Sichuan accent: "Chairman Mao has 
trusted me with a special task on my Shanghai trip this time. 
He wants me to discuss with comrades in Shanghai so they can 
vote for Rong Yiren and elect him vice mayor." 
<H5>  Mao Zedong Praises Rong Yiren, Saying: "He Is Patriotic and </H5>
Capable and Is Fitted for Important Tasks." Chen Yi Said: "As 
a Veteran Communist Party Member, I Will Campaign for This Red 
Capitalist." 
  In the eyes of Shanghai people, Chen Yi had a very lofty 
status as an old mayor. They had great respect and deference 
toward him. Chen Yi said: "Chairman Mao said Rong Yiren is the 
first of our country's national capitalists. Now the Rong 
family has handed over all their enterprises for cooperation 
with the state. This will have a very great influence at home. 
He is patriotic and capable, and is fitted for important tasks." 
  Chen Yi said wittily: "I must admit that Rong Yiren is one 
of my best friends. Today, I will campaign for this red 
capitalist." There followed a loud applause in audience. 
  Chen Yi added: "With his special status, he can play a role 
among the bourgeoisie at home and abroad which I, Chen Yi, 
cannot." 
  He told a story vividly: Several years ago, a big French 
capitalist came and visited Rong Yiren. After chatting with 
him, the French tycoon felt very happy. Chen Yi asked Rong what 
topics had made the Frenchman so happy. Rong Yiren said in a 
perplexed manner: Just some everyday topics like that my family 
lives very comfortably and does not fear racketeering or 
kidnapping, that we have found goals for our careers and 
education, and therefore we want to do more for the state and 
are ready to use the fixed interest on our earnings to set up 
one cotton mill a year. The foreign capitalist who had feared 
the Communist Party as much as a tiger changed his outlook on 
socialism. 
  At this point, Chen Yi asked everyone in a loud voice: "Do 
you think we should elect Rong Yiren vice mayor?" His words 
were immediately drowned by thundering applause. As a result, 
the people's congress resolved to elect Rong Yiren vice mayor of 
Shanghai." 
  In 1959, the central authorities made the decision that Rong 
Yiren be transferred to Beijing to act as vice minister of the 
Textile Industry Ministry of the Central People's Government. 
  The transfer should have been a good thing, but the Cultural 
Revolution soon began. "Talented capitalist roaders" like Rong 
Yiren were the first to become the targets of "dictatorship." 
  He and his wife were forced to clean the streets and had 
their property confiscated. Now the "big capitalist," who is 
nearly 1.85 meters tall, was forced to clean the streets and 
transport coal. 
  In the wake of the Cultural Revolution, people hoped that he 
would "settle accounts," but Rong Yiren only whispered: "It 
doesn't make any sense to settle old accounts." 
  Deng Xiaoping Said to Rong Yiren: You Are To Take 
Charge of Things, but Do Not Make the Enterprise a Bureaucratic 
One. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation's 
[CITIC] Businesses in 1993 Had Nearly 51 Billion Yuan in Assets 
  In 1979, Deng Xiaoping had Rong Yiren and several other 
former industrialists and businessmen come. They then explored 
questions regarding China's opening to the outside world. Deng 
Xiaoping asked Rong Yiren to put forward proposals on attracting 
foreign capital. He said to Rong Yiren: "You take the lead in 
setting up economic entities and in opening windows on the 
outside world. The choice of personnel is up to you. You are 
to take charge of the business and things, but do not make the 
enterprise a bureaucratic one." 
  Returning home from the long and sincere talk, Rong Yiren 
fell into deep contemplation. Afterward, he really came up with 
"proposals." He suggested setting up an international trust and 
investment corporation in keeping with international practice. 
When the proposal reached Zhongnanhai, it immediately won the 
full support of Deng Xiaoping and other leaders. Soon 
afterward, CITIC, headed by Rong Yiren, was set up. 
  Later, CITIC made some world-renowned deals, such as taking 
over Hong Kong's Ka Wah Bank and investing in building 
Australia's Portland Aluminum Mill. CITIC has become a large 
"multinational corporation," which last year had over 51 billion 
yuan in assets and more than 200 enterprises. 
  CITIC's great achievements have made "Rong Yiren, the boss" 
known all over the world. The Asia Satellite Corporation's plan 
to purchase satellites from Houston in 1989 failed as a result 
of the sanctions of Western countries. Later, Rong Yiren helped 
in the matter and the purchase was concluded. In 1990, the 
Asiasat I was successfully launched in China's Xichang. 
  Rong Yiren is very "harsh" with his subordinates. Before 
making a decision, he lets everyone make good preparations and 
express their different views. Once a decision is made, it must 
be carried out resolutely and must not be defied. 
  His "precept," which has created the enterprise's prestige, 
is very "simple:" "Answer every letter and question." "Tell 
only the truth. Do whatever you can and, if you cannot do 
something, say so. When people think what you say is reasonable, 
they will understand you." 
  Different from others, he likes "defiant, yet resourceful" 
people. He thinks they often have the real expertise and 
learning and that they can do great jobs as long as they are 
guided properly. 
  In March 1993, he was elected PRC vice president at the 
Eighth People's Congress session. 
  He considers work the greatest fun in life. He has almost 
forgotten the hobbies of flower-growing and photography, which 
became his pastimes in his unoccupied moments during the 
Cultural Revolution. His only "amateur hobby" now is to watch 
television, especially soccer games. He can name, at one go, 
many of his favorite Chinese soccer players and remember all 
their team numbers. 
  Rong Yiren's wife, Yang Jianqing, was once a CPPCC delegate. 
She is a virtuous woman who supports his husband's career. In 
1986, they marked their golden wedding anniversary. They have 
five children. The Rong family has over 400 relatives scattered 
all over the world, many of whom are celebrated figures of 
industrial and commercial circles, as well as scientific circles.

  [Text] Chinese authorities have stepped up efforts to gag 
the domestic media as the concern about defusing social unrest 
becomes top priority. New orders for the Chinese press to avoid 
divulging state secrets and to steer clear of "sensitive" 
matters were given at an unpublicised conference on media 
discipline jointly held last month by the Communist Party's 
Propaganda Department and the State Bureau of Secrecy. 
Instructions have also been given to all ministries and 
departments to adopt precautionary measures in handling requests 
for information by media other than Xinhua (the New China News 
Agency). Informed sources said the conference on media 
discipline was called on the instructions of President and party 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, who has for the past year taken a 
hard line on propaganda. 
  Speaking at the conclave, Vice-Chief of Propaganda Gong 
Xinhan called upon all media professionals and cadres to "do 
well the work of keeping state secrets. News and publication 
departments must take secrecy as a major item of discipline," 
said Mr Gong, a former propaganda official in Shanghai who is 
considered a protege of Mr Jiang. "The important thing is to 
take preventive measures and to provide journalists with the 
proper education about keeping state secrets. They (media 
workers) must also thoroughly study the regulations on secrecy." 
Mr Gong repeated earlier instructions by the Propaganda 
Department that the press must do its bit for the reform 
enterprise, and must refrain from "making disturbing sounds and 
spreading chaos". 
  Shen Hongying, director of the State Secrecy Bureau, 
exhorted 
journalists to strike a balance between normal news gathering 
and safeguarding state secrets. He called upon them to work 
together with their news sources, particularly government units, 
to observe laws and regulations on secrecy and to avoid 
disclosing state secrets through ignorance or negligence. "We 
must do a thorough self-examination concerning secrecy 
standards," sources quoted Mr Shen as saying. "Sample checks 
must be made (of the work of different media). No stone should 
be left unturned in efforts to plug leaks. Mistakes must be 
rectified as soon as they are discovered." 
  In the past two years, Beijing has passed a State Secrecy 
Law 
as well as a series of Regulations on Safeguarding Secrets in 
News and Publications. It is understood that units including 
the Propaganda Department, the News and Publication 
Administration, and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television 
have conducted sessions of "criticism and self-criticism" on how 
well staff in media units have obeyed the strictures. 
  At the same time, the party General Office and the 
Propaganda 
Department have recently sent directives to party and government 
units asking them to be careful when handling the domestic 
media. "As a general principle, government departments are 
discouraged from granting interviews or providing information to 
the media except Xinhua and, on specific occasions, senior media 
units such as the People's Daily" said a Beijing-based editor.

<F P=106> ["Norms of Professional Ethics of Chinese Journalists" </F>
adopted at the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Chinese 
Journalists Association in January 1991, amended by the Second 
Plenary Session of the Fourth Chinese Journalists Association in 
April 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (XINHUA) -- "Norms of 
Professional Ethics of Chinese Journalists" 
  Chinese journalism is an important integral part of the 
socialist cause led by the CPC. Journalists must adapt 
themselves to the needs of the new situation; endeavor to 
publicize Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; publicize the party and government's principles 
and policies; report news and disseminate information; reflect 
and guide public opinion; and give full play to its role as the 
ears, eyes, and mouthpiece of the party and the people. They 
must also promote the socialist market economy, socialist 
democracy and the legal system, and the socialist spiritual 
civilization; and must exert themselves in the struggle for 
accomplishing the grand goal of socialist modernization. 
  Journalists must be devoted to the cause of socialist 
journalism; uphold the party's basic line; adhere to the 
orientation of serving the people and socialism; emancipate 
their minds and seek truth from facts; carry forward the fine 
tradition and style of journalism of the party and the people; 
oppose money-worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism; and 
step up the cultivation of professional ethics. 
<H5>  I. Serving the People Wholeheartedly </H5>
  To serve the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental goal 
of 
Chinese journalism. 
  Journalists, led by the party, should adhere to the correct 
direction in guiding public opinion, give play to their role as 
the bridge and link between the party and government and the 
masses, and persist in identifying their responsibilities toward 
the party and government with those toward the people. 
  They should endeavor to report the party and government's 
policies and views to the masses promptly, accurately, and 
thoroughly; to provide news and information in order for the 
masses to fulfill their duties as masters of the country, to 
take part in political, economic, cultural, and social life, and 
to keep abreast of what is happening in the world; to laud the 
people's creativity and laborious achievements in socialist 
construction; and to correctly reflect the people's wishes, 
voices, and demands. 
  They should support correct ideas and actions that conform 
with the people's interests; dare to criticize and expose 
erroneous statements and actions, and negative and corrupt 
phenomena that contravene the people's interests; and actively 
bring into play the role of public opinion in exercising 
supervision. 
  They should carry out the mass work enthusiastically, 
maintaining close contacts with the masses, attaching importance 
to letters and visits from the people, properly handling their 
suggestions, criticisms, complaints, and crime-reporting letters 
and visits, and offering wide-ranging service activities for the 
people. 
<H5>  II. Taking Social Benefit as the Supreme Criterion </H5>
  Journalists should correctly handle the relationship between 
social and economic benefits, giving top priority to social 
benefit, and achieving the unity between economic and social 
benefit under this basic premise. They should publicize 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism through news, opinions, 
pictures, and audio and video products in order to mobilize and 
unite the Chinese people of all nationalities in dedicating 
themselves to the great undertaking of building up the 
motherland and rejuvenating the Chinese nation. They should 
adhere to the principle of positive publicity and hold 
themselves responsible to society and the masses, so as to help 
the expansion of productive forces of socialist society, the 
upholding of the four cardinal principles and the reform and 
opening up policy, the maintenance of social stability, and the 
enhancement of ideological and moral quality, and scientific and 
cultural standards of the entire Chinese nation. They should 
not advocate in news reports pornography, murder, violence, 
ignorance, superstitions, and other materials of vulgar taste to 
the detriment of the people's physical and mental health; and 
should foster forward-looking, healthy, civilized social 
practices. 
  They should strictly follow the government's policies toward 
ethnic minorities and religion in news reports, safeguarding 
national interests and unity, and maintaining and promoting the 
motherland's reunification. 
<H5>  III. Observing Laws and Discipline </H5>
  Journalists should conduct themselves within the scope of 
the 
Constitution and other laws, conscientiously observing the 
Constitution, other laws, and the discipline for publicity. 
  They should steadfastly publicize and implement the party 
Central Committee's line, principles, and policies; they should 
not use the media in their control to publicize materials 
contrary to the party Central Committee's decisions. 
  They should safeguard the citizens' rights as stipulated in 
the Constitution; they should neither slander other people nor 
violate their privacy. They should gather news through 
legitimate means, and should respect the views and lawful 
demands of people they interview. 
  They should uphold judicial dignity. Before the court 
announces the verdict on a case heard by the judicial 
department, they should not carry biased reports to predetermine 
the nature or establish the crime of the case. Reports on cases 
heard publicly should conform with the judicial procedures. 
  They should keep party, state, military, scientific and 
technological, financial, and commercial secrets, and take care 
to protect the state's interests and security. 
  They should safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, 
as well as the rights to which they are entitled, including that 
of appeal. 
<H5>  IV. Safeguarding the Truthfulness of News </H5>
  Truthfulness is the lifeblood of journalism. Journalists 
should seek truth from facts, go deep into the realities of 
life, go among the masses, and step up investigation and study. 
They may not make groundless accusations, imagine things, 
concoct stories, resort to deception, or distort facts for 
sensational effects. 
  They should make every effort to look at a matter from all 
sides; guard against subjectivity, one-sidedness, and the 
practice of viewing things in absolute terms; and strive to 
ensure the overall or essential truthfulness of things. 
  They should carry out work earnestly and responsibly, and 
avoid false reporting. In case of false reporting, they should 
assume responsibility on their own and take remedial measures. 
<H5>  V. Upholding the Principle of Objectivity and Fairness </H5>
  Journalists should uphold dialectical and historical 
materialistic viewpoints, proceed from the people's fundamental 
interests, reflect things as they are, and ensure objectivity 
and fairness. 
  In covering events, writing news stories, or filing news 
items, they may not be driven by selfish individual or 
small-group interests, may not vent their personal anger through 
the media under their control, and may not file unfair reports. 
  They should implement the principle of "letting a hundred 
flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," 
respect scientific and practical approaches, and refrain from 
passing judgment at will or taking sides arbitrarily regarding 
controversial academic issues. 
<H5>  VI. Maintaining the Work Style of Performing Official </H5>
Duties Honestly 
  Journalists should maintain and carry forward the fine 
tradition of hard work and plain living, conduct themselves 
honestly, exercise self-discipline, and conscientiously observe 
fiscal and economic discipline, as well as fiscal rules and 
regulations. 
  They should overcome unhealthy practices in their trade. 
They may not publish or carry various forms of "paid news 
stories," trade news stories or newspaper space, demand gifts in 
cash or in kind, or seek personal gain. They may not accept 
cash gifts or negotiable securities in any form from the areas, 
units, or individuals they report. 
  They should strictly distinguish journalistic affairs from 
operational matters. Reporters and editors may not engage in 
advertising or other operational activities in order to seek 
profit. 
  They should maintain an industrious and thrifty work style. 
They may not make special demands on the areas or units they 
cover for material comforts or treatment accorded them. 
<H5>  VII. Displaying the Spirit of Unity and Cooperation </H5>
  Giving scope to overall superiority through unity and 
cooperation is a major distinctive feature of socialist 
journalistic work. Journalists should be modest and eager to 
learn from the public, through practice, and from their 
colleagues. Fellow journalists should foster a relationship 
based on equality, unity, fraternal love, and mutual assistance; 
promote fair competition in their trade; and combat the practice 
of deliberately creating difficulties for colleagues or 
tarnishing colleagues' reputations in order to serve selfish 
individual or small-group interests. 
  They should respect the copyrights of colleagues and other 
authors, and combat the practice of copying or plagiarizing the 
products of other people's labor. 
<H5>  VIII. Enhancing Friendship and Cooperation With Press </H5>
Circles in Other Countries 
  News reporting should be geared toward enhancing 
understanding, friendship, and cooperation between people in 
various countries; respecting the sovereignty and national 
traditions of other countries; opposing hegemonism and power 
politics; safeguarding world peace; and promoting common 
development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Coexistence. 
  They should develop exchanges and cooperation with press 
circles in other countries, and show mutual respect and 
safeguard the dignity of the motherland and Chinese journalists 
during such contacts.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Mu Qing (3668 7230) and reporter Huang Wei </F>
(7806 1218)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Beijing City has 
established a network for cadres to engage in theoretic study. 
The network has made it possible to organize leading cadres at 
all levels to study socialist theory with Chinese 
characteristics in light of realities. 
  In carrying out the work of organizing cadres to engage in 
theoretical study, the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee has 
attached great importance to the study programs for leading 
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government groups. As early 
as 1992, a central study group for major leading Beijing 
Municipal CPC Committee and Government cadres was set up. Such 
groups are staffed with two secretaries solely responsible for 
supervising and inspecting its study programs. A record of each 
student's attendance and performance is kept by the study group. 
Meanwhile, a theoretical study network has been formed in 
Beijing, with each immediate higher-level authority supervising 
the work of each lower-level authority. Priority attention has 
been given to the study programs for cadres at or above the 
department level. 
  In their theoretical study, leading cadres at all levels in 
Beijing City have focused on the goal of emancipating the mind, 
seeking truth from facts, and establishing a socialist market 
economy. They have systematically studied the theory of 
socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. To 
facilitate leading cadres at or above the bureau level to 
achieve a better result in their study, the city's leaders have 
taken the advantages of the capital's favorable conditions by 
inviting responsible comrades of various ministries and 
commissions and experts in relevant fields to deliver reports on 
such special topics as current financial, foreign trade, and 
taxation systems reforms, as well as on the establishment of a 
modern enterprising system. These reports, serving as a 
supplementary to the study programs, have helped leading cadres 
at or above the bureau level master the market economy theory 
and relevant new knowledge, acquire a general understanding 
about the establishment of a socialist market economy framework, 
and enhance their policy-related theory and decision-making 
level. 
  Leading cadres at all levels in Beijing City have integrated 
their theoretical study with investigations and research. They 
have tried to deepen their understanding about theoretical 
problems through investigations and research and by improving 
their theoretical level to find new methods to solve practical 
issues. This is one of the outstanding features in their 
theoretical study. Last year, Secretary Chen Xitong and Mayor Li 
Qiyan of Beijing City made more than 30 trips to visit mountain 
and rural areas, industrial and commercial enterprises, 
construction sites, and universities and colleges. They 
listened carefully to opinions expressed by the masses, solved 
new problems which had cropped up during the course of reform 
and opening up, and took a lead in writing theoretical articles 
and investigation reports, including: "There Is No Leadership 
Without Conducting Investigations and Researches" and "Work Hard 
To Achieve the Goal of Leading a Fairly Comfortable Life." 
Under their leadership, leading cadres at all levels in the 
city have made it their practice to conduct investigations and 
research in the grass-roots units. Leading cadres at or above 
the district, county, and bureau levels have written more than 
250 theoretical articles and investigation reports. 
  Party schools at all levels in Beijing City have also 
sponsored rotating training classes for cadres at or above the 
department level. They have sponsored more than 20 terms of 
rotating training classes for cadres at or above the bureau 
level, with more than 1,600 people having received the training. 
They have achieved the goal put forward by Beijing City's 
leaders that leading cadres at or above the bureau level should 
receive such rotating training once a year. They have sponsored 
more than 250 terms of rotating training classes for cadres at 
or above the department level, with more than 12,000 people 
having received the training. Propaganda departments at all 
levels in Beijing City have conducted more than 250 report 
meetings in various forms as a supplementary to the study 
programs, with more than 200,000 people having attended such 
report meetings.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Lin Tzu-Chieh (2651 1311 2212): "HIV </F>
Carriers Discovered in 22 Provinces in China"] 
  [Text] At present, 22 provinces in China have reported HIV 
carriers and the reported number is 1,159. However, departments 
concerned have estimated the actual number of HIV carriers is 
between 5,000 and 10,000. There is a tendency toward a gradual 
spreading of AIDS in China. According to Ministry of Public 
Health officials, shortage of funds and insufficient publicity 
and education are two major difficulties in the prevention and 
treatment of AIDS at present. 
  Sun Xinhua, a Ministry of Public Health official, said 
during 
an interview with this reporter by long-distance telephone 
yesterday: Although governments at various levels allocated 10 
million yuan for the prevention and treatment of AIDS last year, 
the amount was far from enough and there was difficulty in 
meeting the needs. Therefore, in some places where increased 
investment has been made, special test centers and hospitals 
have been set up. However, most patients have to receive 
treatment at ordinary hospitals. Some patients stay at home and 
are visited by local doctors once a month or once every two 
months. 
  At present, China still has not formulated laws or 
regulations on the prevention and treatment of AIDS, said Sun 
Xinhua. In 1988, the Ministry of Public Health promulgated a 
policy document--the "Law on the Prevention and Cure of 
Contagious Diseases," which has been in force until now. The 
authorities are thinking of taking further measures to 
strengthen management of the prevention and treatment of AIDS 
but nothing has yet been put on the legislation agenda. China 
is an area in which the spreading of AIDS is not serious but 
there is a tendency toward a gradual spreading of the disease. 
HIV carriers are concentrated in Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong, 
Shanghai, and Beijing, said Sun Xinhua, and those in Yunnan 
account for 80 percent of the total. The main reason why there 
are more HIV carriers in Yunnan is that many people inject 
drugs. Sexual contact is another way of spreading the disease. 
A considerable number of HIV carriers in other cities have been 
infected abroad. Some are foreign staff members and workers. 
Others have become HIV carriers after working as laborers or 
after visiting their relatives abroad. 
  In view of the actual situation in China, said Sun Xinhua, 
the authorities have followed two main principles in the 
prevention and treatment of AIDS. One is to take measures to 
slow down the speed of the spreading of the disease. The other 
is to make great efforts to carry out publicity and education 
work by means of the press and to pay special attention to 
monitoring the "high-risk groups." 
  In response to being asked whether or not HIV carriers are 
discriminated against in China, Sun Xinhua said: In many places 
in the world, HIV carriers are being discriminated against but 
the public health administrative departments in China have 
demanded that various localities should not discriminate against 
HIV carriers and the identities of HIV carriers must be kept 
secret. However, in the eyes of the people, these HIV carriers 
are beneath pity. The people think that undesirable habits are 
the main cause of contracting the virus.

  [Text] The clean-up of China will cost US$200 billion, most 
of which must come from overseas investment according to Yu 
Yuefeng, vice-president of the China Association of 
Environmental Protection Industry. Mr Yu said it would cost $15 
million to clean the city of Guangzhou alone. 
  Pollution control was beyond China's means, but investing in 
the mainland's environmental protection meant having a stake in 
the market for green technology to emerge in the next two to 
five years, he said. The Private Sector Committee Environment 
Centre estimated the global market for environmental 
technologies to reach $600 billion by the turn of the century. 
  "We will need investments internationally and locally. 
Environmental degradation is an obstacle in the market which 
cannot be solved by China alone," Mr Yu said. He called on 
foreign companies to help China develop its own technology to 
stop environmental degradation resulting from massive industrial 
development. "Chinese technology is cheap and practical, but 
only for other Asian centres. We will follow a basic strategy 
to use foreign investment in order to exploit the market and 
export overseas," he said. Mr Yu predicted a huge market for 
environmental technology, but said China's preparations depended 
on costly American technology. 
  The most pressing concern was treatment of water and solid 
waste, which would account for 70 per cent of the $200 billion. 
Air pollution, for the promotion health and machine 
maintenance, was also a concern. China was in desperate need of 
dust-removal technology for both general and industrial use, Mr 
Yu said. Machines to extract dust and sulphur were especially 
needed in the southern region where manufacturing was 
concentrated. China was looking to foreign companies to develop 
better ways of treating water from wood and pulp plants, highly 
concentrated waste water and toxic waste. "We have over 30,000 
small pulp plants. Pollution is a concern, but closing them 
would cause a shortage of paper products," Mr Yu said. 
  Ordinary mainlanders felt a strong need for environmental 
protection because of worsening pollution, but a country with 
per capita income below $1,000 could do little, he said. "Now 
that people have bread and butter, they can worry about the 
environment. There is a growing awareness and concern," he said. 
Mr Yu said those countries with a per capita income of more 
than $3,000 must initiate the process, and countries such as 
Japan could be doing more to help.

<F P=106> [Revisions to the "Customs Procedures of the PRC Concerning </F>
Levying Import Duties on Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles 
and Personal Postal Articles"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The newly revised 
"Customs Procedures of the PRC Concerning Levying Import Duties 
on Incoming Travelers' Luggage Articles and Personal Postal 
Articles" ["procedures"] were promulgated recently. 
  The official in charge said: The "procedures" were 
formulated 
in April 1991 by the State Council's Tariffs Regulations 
Committee. To accommodate the changes resulting from the 
state's financial and taxation system reform and from the 
adjustments in import duties, and to better implement the 
state's industrial policy, the State Council's Tariffs 
Regulations Committee, based on State Council Decrees 134 and 
135, made revisions to the "procedures." The major revisions 
are: First, the term "import duties," as it is referred to in 
the "procedures," has been redefined. The definition of "import 
duties" in the original "procedures" included customs duties and 
industrial and commercial tax. Due to the turnover tax system's 
reform, the term industrial and commercial tax has been canceled 
and replaced with value-added tax and consumption tax. To 
accommodate the change, relevant articles and provisions of the 
"procedures" have been revised accordingly. Second, automobiles 
and motorcycles have been removed from the list of taxable 
luggage and postal articles, and import duties have been levied 
on these items as ordinary import goods according to the "Import 
and Export Duty Regulations of the Customs of the PRC," to 
better manage imported automobiles and motorcycles and to better 
carry out the state's industrial policy. Third, the term 
"grain, grain powders" in the No. 1 "Table of Duty Rates" has 
been changed to "food." Fourth, customs duties, value-added 
tax, and consumption tax have been combined into one duty rate 
to simplify tax levy procedures. 
  The official said: The aforementioned revisions do not 
affect the regulations governing the amounts of taxable and 
tax-exempted luggage articles of incoming travelers and incoming 
personal postal articles. 
  It has been learned that the State Council's Tariffs 
Regulations Committee's office is under the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, and is responsible for carrying out work 
delegated to it by the State Council's Tariffs Regulations 
Committee.

"China's Unmanned Aircraft Research and Development at World 
Level"] 
  [Text] Xian -- China's research and development on small 
unmanned aircraft has reached world standards after more than 30 
years of effort. 
  This reporter learned a few days ago from the Xian Unmanned 
Aircraft Development Center that the B-7 pilotless plane 
researched and developed by the center had passed the 
examination of a ministerial-level design and model inspection 
authority. 
  The plane is of an advanced small piston-engine type 
weighing 
90 kg, with a maximum speed of 100 m a second and an elevation 
range of over 5,000 m; the range of remote control exceeds 40 km 
and the cruising range is 60 minutes. The plane is equipped 
with computerized electronic systems, integrated circuit wiring, 
digitized command codes, integrated module-scanning, an 
"automated return-flight aviation system," a 360- degree 
directional setting capability, and a car-mounted capability 
while it is on the ground. The aircraft technology that went in 
the making of the unmanned plane has reached the advanced 
standard of other similar international plane products. 
  In 1958, the Xibei University of Industry successfully 
test-flew No "04" unmanned plane, opening a new era in our 
country's unmanned aircraft development. 
  The B-1 target drone successfully researched and developed 
by 
the university on the basis of its experience in 
remote-controlled plane models has gone into factory production. 
A total of more than 6,000 of the B-2 target drones that came 
out in 1971 have been produced, many of them exported to 
countries in Southern Asia, Africa, and South America.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The China Society of 
Creativity Studies was set up in Shanghai today. 
  The study of creativity is an emerging science researching 
the creativity of human beings, applications of creative 
thinking, and the processes involved in human discovery and 
invention. 
  In the late 1970s, Chinese experts and scholars entered the 
study of creativity. Over the past ten-plus years, a dozen 
societies promoting the study were set up in Shanghai and other 
provinces and cities. 
  Scholars in the study have published more than 30 
compilations of works in the field. 
  The number of experts engaged in the study has increased 
from 
about 200 a decade ago to several tens of thousands now. 
  There are 48 universities in China which now offer courses 
in 
the study of creativity. 
  Approved by the State Commission of Science and Technology, 
the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the China Association for 
Science and Technology, the society will devote its efforts to 
international and domestic academic exchanges and promote the 
development, application and popularization of the study in 
China.

<F P=106> [By JIEFANGJUN BAO reporter Wang Wenjie (3769 2429 2638) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, state president, and 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, held a discussion 
meeting with the trainees at the National Defense University on 
8 June. He emphasized during the discussion: In order to study 
well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, it is most important to consider the 
new circumstances and tasks, seriously implement the principle 
of integrating theory with practice, persistently combine the 
study of theories with the research on actual problems, and 
display a study style of integrating study with application and 
of studying for the purpose of application. 
  Present at the discussion were vice chairmen of the Central 
Military Commission Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, as well as 
members of the Central Military Commission Chi Haotian, Zhang 
Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou. 
  Six representatives of the trainees spoke during the 
discussion. They discussed such issues as how to thoroughly 
implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building 
during the new period and the Central Military Commission's 
general and specific policies, how to step up Army building in 
an all-round way, and how to further strengthen army-government 
unity and army-people unity. 
  After hearing their views, Jiang Zemin made an important 
speech. He first pointed out: To seize opportunity, deepen 
reform, open up wider, promote development and maintain 
stability is the general task set by the party Central Committee 
for the whole party and the whole country. The general task, 
set under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reflects the 
fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities across 
the country. In order to study theories in light of reality, we 
must uphold the general task and consider it to be the greatest 
reality. High-ranking Army cadres should take the lead in 
ensuring that the orders of the party Central Committee, the 
State Council, and the Central Military Commission reach all 
levels, and in doing all work well according to high and strict 
standards. High-ranking Army cadres should display a strong 
party spirit and a high degree of sense of organization and 
discipline, strictly enforce prohibitions, and obey orders in 
all actions. 
  Jiang Zemin then pointed out: The Army should take a further 
step to carry forward fine traditions and step up the building 
of socialist spiritual civilization. It should uphold the 
purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly and advocate the 
spirit of selfless dedication. It should deepen the campaigns 
to learn from Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other heroes 
and models; further advance and enrich revolutionary 
righteousness; foster good morality; and always keep the 
distinctive character of Red Army veterans, as well as the image 
of the People's Army. 
  Jiang Zemin emphasized: To seek truth and do a solid work is 
the key to success in every work. Leading cadres must display a 
style of doing arduous and meticulous work, work steadily and 
make solid progress in every phase of the work. Leading cadres 
must do all they can to reduce activities at the higher level, 
constantly conduct investigation and study among troops of 
grass-roots units, and familiarize themselves with the actual 
situation of the troops, so that the policies and guidance 
formulated by them will be more effective and with clearer 
objectives. In the final analysis, to do a solid work means 
doing a solid work for grass-roots units. When a leading organ 
makes a policy decision or issues instructions, it must fully 
consider the reality and endurance of grass-roots units. We 
should create a concentrated atmosphere of doing a solid work 
throughout the Army, strictly carry out all the policy decisions 
of the Central Military Commission, and constantly push Army 
building forward in an all-round way. 
  The training class is the second rotational training class 
for cadres holding regular corps-level or higher posts to study 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. It 
is run by the National Defense University at the request of the 
Central Military Commission and the three general departments. 
  Zhu Dunfa, commandant of the National Defense University, 
chaired the discussion meeting. Li Wenqing, political commissar 
of the University, attended the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Link theory with 
practice in studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  That was the message stressed by Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin, chairman of the Central Military Commission, when he had 
a discussion with cadets of the National Defence University here 
on Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Jiang told the cadets to use the theory in the study of 
current issues. 
  Also taking part in the discussion were vice-chairmen of the 
commission Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, and commission members. 
  Summing up the discussion, Jiang pointed out that the main 
tasks for the whole party and the whole nation are to seize the 
opportunity to expand the reform, enlarge the opening-up to the 
outside world and promote development while maintaining 
stability. In studying Deng's theory, one should link it to 
these tasks. 
  Jiang called on senior military leaders to take a leading 
role in carrying out the orders of the Party Central Committee, 
the State Council and the Military Commission.

the officers and men of the whole Army. In implementing this 
strategic task, the key lies in leading the cadres, especially 
the high-level cadres, to link up with reality and lead the way 
in studying and utilizing the texts properly, so that the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics truly enters 
the ideology and imbues our work. Today and tomorrow we will be 
publishing articles by leading comrades from six major military 
units on what they learned from participating in the Third 
Theoretical Discussion Class for Senior Leading Cadres at the 
Provincial and Ministry Levels. These reflect the results from 
one angle and are worth reading. [end editor's note] 
<H5>  "Strengthening the Consciousness of Strategy, Raising the </H5>
Level of Leadership" by Song Qingwei [1345 3237 3262] 
  Paying close attention to questions of strategy has been a 
consistent ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping. In the 
Selected Works this issue is discussed in dozens of 
places. Comrade Jiang Zemin has strongly stressed that 
high-level leading comrades must raise their strategic 
consciousness and decisionmaking level, put efforts into 
studying Comrade Xiaoping's rich experience in handling party, 
state, and military affairs and his excellent leadership skills, 
and continually raise their capacity to guide the building of 
the forces and master complex situations. This explains, in a 
deep way, the basic contents, methods, and requirements for 
leading cadres in strengthening their consciousness of strategy. 
  1. The characteristics of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic 
theoretical system of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a complete, scientific, and theoretical 
system and also a rigorous and meticulous strategic system. As 
a theoretical system, it is contemporary Chinese Marxism. As a 
strategic system, it is an overall and long-term program for our 
country's reform and modernization. This strategic system has 
many fresh elements. It is practical--it is based on China's 
national situation, takes its own road and, through practice, 
has formulated and perfected national development strategies. 
This is the scientific basis on which Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
planned national development strategies. It has a mass 
nature--in every element it respects and relies on the people, 
taking the "three benefits" as its basic standard for assessing 
whether something is right or wrong. This is the source of 
knowledge on which Comrade Deng Xiaoping has planned national 
development strategies. It is contemporary--it is in accord 
with the needs of the times and useful for grasping historical 
opportunities, for implementing strategic guidance without 
losing opportunities, and for accelerating the development of 
the economy. This is an important characteristic and condition 
for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's planning of national development 
strategies. It is creative--it unifies the liberating of 
thought and seeking truth from facts, studies new situations, 
and resolves new problems. This fully manifests the great 
boldness and courage of the national development strategies 
planned by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. 
  2. The importance of having leading cadres strengthen their 
consciousness of strategy. Having leading cadres study and 
master the strategic ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and 
continually strengthen their consciousness of strategy, is a way 
of engaging in basic construction. This is not only very 
necessary but an extremely pressing task. 
  First, the strategic decisions of the party central 
committee 
need to be implemented through the various levels of leading 
cadres like us. Only by strengthening our consciousness of 
strategy will we be able to always maintain a high degree of 
unity with the central authorities and realize the strategic 
intent of the party central committee. At present, if we are to 
correctly master the overall work situation of the whole party 
and the whole people, and properly handle the relationships 
between reform, development, and stability, leading cadres must 
have a high degree of strategic consciousness, must consciously 
master the work of their own departments and own units, bring it 
into line with the overall situation of party and state work, 
truly subordinate themselves to this work, and safeguard the 
overall situation. Over the last few years, local protectionism 
and the phenomenon whereby "when the upper levels put forward a 
policy, the lower levels devise a countermeasure" have appeared. 
I am afraid that this is linked with some leaders lacking a 
consciousness of strategy. 
  Second, correctly formulating development strategies and 
implementing strategic guidance is a basic responsibility of 
leading cadres at all levels, especially senior leading cadres. 
Experience has proven that whether the consciousness of 
strategy is strong or not will directly affect whether or not 
policies are correct. Why is it that over the last few years, 
we have seen great differences between areas which have similar 
conditions and between units with similar conditions, in the 
quality of work and very great differences in their speeds of 
development? This also is closely linked to whether or not the 
leaders have a consciousness of strategy. Only with a 
farsighted strategic mind is it possible to stand high, see far, 
understand complex situations, grasp the essence of things, and 
make correct strategic decisions. 
  Strengthening the consciousness of strategy is an 
important element in raising the leadership level and work 
efficiency. Under the new conditions of establishing a market 
economy, if one's consciousness of strategy is not strong, one 
will fall into a blind situation where one only considers the 
partial, not the overall, and only the immediate without 
thinking about the long-term. Thereby, one might be busy all 
day and yet work results will only be average. 
  3. In the practice of leadership work, how are we to 
strengthen the consciousness of strategy? In strengthening the 
consciousness of strategy, we must first rely on study and, 
second, we must rely on practice. Relying on study means that 
we must study and research the strategic ideas and strategic 
leadership skills of Comrade Xiaoping. In relying on practice, 
we must use Comrade Xiaoping's strategic ideas and strategic 
leadership skills in our own leadership work and strengthen our 
leadership skills through practice. Seen from the current 
situation, we must pay attention to at least the following 
points. 
  First, we must pay attention to the circumstances and take 
the overall situation into regard. It is necessary to pay full 
attention to the development and changes in the domestic and 
international situations, frequently pondering major questions 
which affect the overall situation. This is the first link in 
strengthening the consciousness of strategy. The party central 
committee has decided that the overall task for this year is to 
"grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, 
promote development, and maintain stability." In such a 
situation, paying attention to circumstances, grasping the 
overall situation, and subordinating ourselves to the overall 
situation is now more important than ever. As Comrade Xiaoping 
pointed out: "There are some things which appear impossible 
when viewed from the partial situation but which become possible 
when viewed from the overall situation. Thus, we must always 
consider things from the overall situation." 
  Second, we must look at things from the long-term and plan 
strategies from the macrolevel. Strategy is about managing the 
future. A leader with a strong consciousness of strategy will 
certainly have a long-term development view. If we speak in 
terms of the armed forces, in accordance with the requirements 
for modern high-level warfare, in doing well in reform and 
development of the armed forces, in fostering and training 
outstanding young cadres, and so on, we must take a longer view 
and proceed from the long-term interests of the state and the 
armed forces. 
  Third, we must master important matters and manage the 
overall situation well. Whether or not high-level leading 
cadres have a strong consciousness of strategy is manifested in 
their work. That is, it is manifested in whether or not they 
can master important matters and manage the overall situation. 
In their practical work, high-level cadres must manage 
"strategy," "battles," and "tactics." When daily work tasks are 
complex and numerous, it is easy for such minor tasks to tie one 
up. This requires that we strengthen our consciousness of 
strategy, give more thought to the overall situation, frequently 
discuss important matters, be good at planning, and put most of 
our energy into thinking about the key positions and crucial 
links in the overall situation. Thereby we will be able to 
master the overall situation and guard against trying to handle 
big and small matters at the same time. 
  Fourth, grasping the opportunity and seeking development. 
The ancients said: "Soldiers vie in battle, generals vie in 
strategy, overall commanders vie for opportunity." Grasping the 
opportunity is intended for seeking development. A 
consciousness of strategy is tightly linked with the 
consciousness of opportunity and the consciousness of 
development. If one wants to strengthen the consciousness of 
strategy and raise the level of leadership, it is necessary to 
be good at grasping opportunities and seeking development. When 
the orientation is set, there should be brave exploration and 
forging ahead and, while studying new situations and resolving 
new problems, we should do well in our work creatively. 
<H5>  "Correctly Master the Relationships Between Reform, </H5>
Development and Stability" by Gu Hui [0942 6540] 
  Reform, development and stability are key elements in the 
Selected Works. Seriously studying Comrade 
Xiaoping's scientific conclusions on the relationships between 
reform, development, and stability has very major significance 
in deeply understanding and firmly mastering the overall task of 
"grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, expand opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability" put forward by 
the party Central Committee and in doing well in the overall 
construction and reform of the armed forces. 
  Developing the economy and throwing off poverty and 
backwardness as quickly as possible are basic requirements in 
consolidating and developing socialism. As Comrade Xiaoping 
noted in a major speech while inspecting the south: 
"Development is the only real truth" and "If we do not uphold 
socialism, do not engage in reform and opening up, do not 
develop the economy, and do not improve the lives of the people, 
we will only reach a dead end." 
  Reform is a basic motive force in liberating and developing 
the productive forces. Without reform, there will be no future. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping holds that developing the economy is 
inseparable from reform. He clearly pointed out: "I advocate 
reform. If we do not reform, we have no future. The practice 
over several decades has shown that the old ways cannot be 
successful." Our country's original economic structure played a 
positive role in history. However, following the development of 
the economy, that unitary ownership structure and ossified 
planning economy structure became increasingly unsuited to the 
development of the social productive forces. Where lies the way 
out? Comrade Deng Xiaoping firmly pointed out: "Upholding 
reform and opening up are the things which will determine 
China's future." "If at present we do not continue to implement 
reform, our modernization and our socialist cause will be 
ruined." 
  Reform is not a temporary task at a certain stage 
but a long-term, deep revolution. Seen from the various deep 
contradictions and problems in our country's economy at present, 
we recognize that the scale of fixed asset investment is too 
great, the economic structure is unbalanced, the economic 
performance has declined, and so on. Basically, all of these 
are the result of a situation wherein the defects of the old 
system have not yet been overcome and the new system has not yet 
been completely formed. The only way to resolve these 
contradictions and problems is to continually reform and 
establish, as quickly as possible, a socialist market economy 
structure. In this sense, the problem of our country's 
development is essentially a question of reform and only through 
reform will it be possible to further consolidate and develop 
the socialist system. 
  Stability is for guaranteeing the smooth development of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction and for the 
long-term peace and stability of the country. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping especially stressed: "Of China's problems, that which 
surpasses all others is the need for stability. Without a 
stable environment, it will be impossible to achieve anything 
and the achievements already realized will be lost." A 
political situation of unity and stability is a basic guarantee 
for reform, opening up, and modernization. Whenever the 
political situation and social environment of stability and 
unity are destroyed, there will be no way to carry out economic 
construction normally and the people's lives will be subject to 
serious effects. Thus, Comrade Deng Xiaoping places very great 
stress on stability in the political realm and in the social 
environment. He has noted: "If there is instability and there 
is political chaos, it will be impossible to engage in building 
socialism and then it will be impossible to even talk about 
anything else." In administering the country, this is "a major 
principle, which governs minor principles. While these small 
principles may still be principles, we cannot operate without 
this major principle." 
  How are we to master the relationships between reform, 
development, and stability? After studying the Selected 
Works I believe that we should place stress on grasping 
three aspects: 
  1. We must uphold the ideological method of dialectical 
materialism. There exists between reform, development, and 
stability, a relationship of dialectical unity. Reform is the 
motive force, development is the goal, and stability is the 
guarantee. Reform, development, and stability are mutual 
conditions for each other and they complement each other. None 
of these can be done without. Without reform, we cannot talk 
about development and stability. Without stability, we cannot 
talk about reform and development. Thus, in mastering the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability, the key 
lies in mastering and utilizing the ideological method of 
dialectical materialism, to guard against situations where 
taking care of one things results in losing sight of others, or 
where the specific is considered as representative of the whole. 
  2. We must establish a concept of the overall task. Social 
practice has repeatedly proven that, in whatever we do, if we do 
not have a concept of the overall task, and energies are 
dissipated in many areas, then what needs to be done will not be 
done well. If everyone works with one heart and one mind, they 
will be able to work toward development, base themselves on 
reform, stress stability, and do well in all aspects of work. 
As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: "What is needed now 
is for the party, government, military, and people throughout 
the country to work with one heart and subordinate themselves 
to, and concern themselves with, the overall task of building 
the country." Only when there is a concept of the overall task 
will it be possible to achieve a high-level unity of reform, 
development, and stability. For example, in respect of the 
question of readjustment of interests during the reforms, it is 
necessary to guide people to establish a concept of the overall 
task, so that they can fully understand the relationship between 
the partial situation and the overall and between immediate and 
long-term interests. Only by truly establishing a concept of 
the overall task will it be possible, in a stable social 
environment, to truly realize the anticipated goals of reform 
and promote the development of socialist modernization. 
  3. It is necessary to uphold the principle that the people's 
interests are above all else. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always 
concerned himself with the interests and aspirations of the 
broad masses of people, and always taken "whether or not the 
people support it," "whether or not the people endorse it," 
"whether or not the people are happy," and "whether or not the 
people respond" as the points of departure and points of return 
when the line, principle, and policies are being formulated. 
Thus, in correctly handling the relationships between reform, 
development, and stability, it is necessary to uphold the 
principle of putting the people's interests above all else. In 
this way, there will be no unresolvable contradictions and no 
unsolvable problems. 
  In reform, development and stability, the armed forces 
shoulder an important historical responsibility and it is 
necessary to put efforts into strengthening comprehensive 
construction, to guarantee a high degree of stability and 
centralized unity of the armed forces. As Comrade Jiang Zemin 
has pointed out: "As far as the armed forces are concerned, it 
is necessary for us to bring fully into play the enthusiasm and 
creativity of the officers and men of the whole Army, so that 
they realize achievements in the modernization of the armed 
forces and make more contributions to the prosperity, strength, 
and long-term stability of the state." The armed forces are an 
important component part of the state's regime. The basic task 
of the armed forces is to peacefully labor in defending the 
motherland and safeguarding the people. The armed forces have a 
special historical responsibility in upholding reform, 
participating in development, and safeguarding stability. 
  In this respect, we must always bear in mind Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's idea on "stability being more important than anything 
else," so that we can better take on the sacred missions of 
safeguarding state security and unity and defending socialist 
modernization. In accordance with Chairman Jiang Zemin's 
general requirements of "political standards, military mastery, 
fine work style, strict discipline, and powerful guarantees," we 
must strengthen the building of the armed forces in an overall 
way and guarantee high-level stability and centralized unity. 
<H5>  "In the New Period, We Must Put Effort Into Improving the </H5>
Performance of the Military Economy" by Liu Jingsong [1491 4737 
2646] 
  We comrades who work in the armed forces must, through 
studying the Selected Works, master in an overall way 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and strive to resolve the new problems 
which have arisen in armed forces construction in the new 
situation. An important aspect of this is that we must actively 
accord with the requirements of a socialist market economy and 
put great efforts into improving the performance of the military 
economy, to truly achieve "powerful guarantees." 
  1. The establishment of a socialist market economy structure 
has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges in 
military economy work. The 14th CPC National Congress, in 
accordance with the ideas of Comrade Xiaoping, set down that the 
target of our country's economic structural reform is to 
establish a socialist market economy structure. The military 
economy is an important component part of the social economy and 
it will inevitably face completely new environments, questions, 
and demands. Our Army's military economy operational mechanism 
was initially formed under planned economy conditions and has 
played an important part in the building of the armed forces. 
However, some problems existed such as the supply system being 
irregular, planned distribution being irrational, guarantee 
methods being inflexible, and widespread losses and waste. This 
restricted the improvement of military economic results. The 
establishment of a market economy structure is beneficial to: 
The rational deployment of military economy resources; 
developing the economy and the gradual alleviation of military 
fund shortages; the improvement of supply guarantee efficiency 
through diverse channels; liberating and developing national 
defense productive forces; and beneficial to improving the 
consumption structure of the military economy. 
  At the same time, in the process of making the transition to 
a market economy, some complex contradictions and problems may 
appear. For example, the resource deployment structure which 
affects some of the military economy has increased the 
difficulties of gathering and supplying some military materials. 
This has increased the difficulties of logistics management. 
Some new contradictions have appeared in the training and 
retention of skilled personnel, while some new situations and 
problems have appeared in production and operations by the armed 
forces. 
  2. In improving the performance of the military economy 
under market economy conditions, we must stress grasping the 
basic principles. The military economy is a special part of the 
national economic system, which is used to guarantee national 
security. In a situation where our country's comprehensive 
national strengths are not powerful, there cannot be a very 
large increase in military spending and the supply-demand 
contradiction is still the main contradiction in military 
economy work. Thus, we must seriously implement Chairman Jiang 
Zemin's important directive on "further improving the 
performance of the logistics economy" and put the stress on 
improving the performance of the military economy. 
Specifically, we should grasp the following principles: A. We 
must subordinate ourselves to the overall task of national 
economic construction. B. We must implement the new-period 
military strategy policy. C. We must respect the patterns of 
the socialist market economy. D. We must use scientific 
management methods. E. We must bring into play the outstanding 
traditions of arduous struggle and building the army through 
thrift and hard work. 
  3. In improving military economic performance at the present 
stage, we should put efforts into resolving the major problems. 
The current military economic management mechanism is far from 
meeting the demands of a market economy, or the demands of 
improving the quality of the forces, and the phenomena of 
stressing planning and looking lightly on the market, and 
stressing investment and ignoring output, still exist. Thus, it 
is necessary to deepen reform and explore new measures for 
resolving the problems in military economy work. 
  A. Transforming ideological concepts. The essence of 
liberating thought and seeking truth from facts runs through the 
Selected Works from cover to cover. It should be 
said that since the implementation of the socialist market 
economy operations mechanism, we have seen great changes on the 
ideological and conceptual levels. However, these changes are 
far from sufficient. The key issues in transforming ideological 
concepts are: Seriously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and basic 
knowledge about the socialist market economy; essentially 
recognizing the characteristics and patterns of a socialist 
market economy and its effects on military economic work; and 
seriously establishing a market concept which involves prices 
fluctuating in accordance with market conditions, a concept of 
performance which has value as a yardstick, a concept of 
time-efficiency involving improvement of material circulation 
efficiency, a concept of mutual benefit in economic exchanges, a 
concept of self-strengthening through participation in market 
competition, a concept of skilled personnel, and so on. 
  B. Reforming guarantee systems. The focuses of the 
reform of the military economic guarantee structure lie in 
readjusting the structure, optimizing major factors, and putting 
in order relationships between the inside and the outside. 
First, we need to readjust guarantee structures within the 
armed forces and build a unified logistics structure in which 
unified and dispersed systems are combined. Second, we must 
establish joint military-civilian guarantee systems, so that 
some of the livelihood services for the armed forces are 
gradually taken on by society. At the same time, we must open 
up to society some of the surplus military economic functions 
and, under the precondition of guaranteeing the completion of 
military tasks, provide some compensated services to society. 
  C. Improving supply and management. Management brings 
results and also guarantees capacity. In improving the 
management of the military economy, the most important thing at 
present is to grasp the following points well: First, establish 
a standardized supply system; second, improve cost management; 
third, improve the collection and storage of goods and 
materials; and fourth, improve production and operations 
management. 
  D. Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. 
First, we must strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control 
over decisionmaking; second, we must strengthen regulation and 
control over military industry production; third, we must 
readjust the interests relationships well and properly handle 
the relationships between immediate and long-term interests, 
between partial and overall interests, and between individual 
and collective interests. 
  E. We must do a good job of establishing laws and 
regulations. For example, we need to formulate a basic law for 
our country's national defense construction and, on this basis, 
formulate as quickly as possible laws and regulations which 
directly relate to military economic work. These will include, 
for example: A "Law Governing the Ordering of Goods by the 
Military," "Military Budget Law," "Wartime Mobilization Law," 
"Military Production Law," "National Defence Science and 
Technology Research Law," "Reserve Strength Construction Law," 
and so on. 
  F. Improving the quality of personnel. We must put efforts 
into training a contingent of skilled personnel who have a high 
degree of political consciousness and are well-versed in 
military economic work. This is a most crucial strategic task 
for doing well in military economic work under market economy 
conditions. While developing the market economy, we must 
educate military economic work personnel to maintain sober 
minds, establish a correct view on life and correct values, and 
foster fine professional ethics. We also need to strengthen 
professional training for personnel engaged in military economic 
work, study local reform experiences, strengthen our capacity to 
accord with the market, utilize the market, and handle matters 
in accordance with the patterns of the market economy.

With Chinese Characteristics--Impressions of Leading Comrades 
From Some Major Military Units After Studying Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] "Deeply Understanding the Strategic Idea of 
Maintaining Stability" by Li Jiulong [2621 0046 7893] 
  The idea that stability exceeds everything else in 
importance 
is an extremely important idea which runs right through Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
[Selected Works]. Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out 
powerfully that stability is the crux for China's development 
and strengthening. Studying this idea by Comrade Xiaoping is of 
major significance in our doing well in the various aspects of 
reform and construction work. 
  The Selected Works elaborate on the idea that 
stability is more important than everything else from many 
angles, many sides, and many levels. We can sum up the ideas in 
the following points: 
  Stability is in accord with the highest and greatest 
interests of our party, our Army, and the people of all 
nationalities in our country. Without a stable political 
situation and a stable social environment, there would be no 
speedy economic growth, no social development and the people 
would not be able to live and work in peace. If we are to 
continually consolidate and perfect the socialist system in 
practice, we must have a political and social environment which 
has long-term stability. Otherwise, the socialist system, which 
has been created through the sacrifices and the blood of 
millions of people, will not be consolidated and safeguarded and 
could even face the danger of dissolution. As Comrade Xiaoping 
has pointed out: "A collapse can occur overnight. Collapsing is 
easy, construction is very difficult." The 40-plus years of 
history since the establishment of New China have powerfully 
proven that, with a stable political situation and social 
environment, our socialist cause has been able to achieve very 
rapid development but, as soon as the situation of stability is 
destroyed, our socialist revolution and construction loses its 
vigor and vitality. Especially during the 10 years of internal 
disorder during the "Cultural Revolution," our socialist economy 
was pushed to the point of collapse, resulting in a greater 
disparity between our country and the developed countries of the 
world. Thus, maintaining stability is in the highest interests 
of the party and the state. At the same time, under the 
socialist system, stability is also a social goal. If the 
country is at peace, the people are at peace. If the people can 
live in peace, they are happy in their work. This reflects the 
greatest interests of our country's people. 
  Seek stability through reform, opening up and development. 
Comrade Xiaoping's expositions and the practical experiences of 
reform and opening up over the more than last 10 years tell us 
that in the process of reform and development, there is a need 
for a stable political and social environment. Without a stable 
environment, nothing else can be even talked about, nothing else 
can be achieved, and even the achievements which have already 
been scored will be lost. Meanwhile, upholding reform and 
opening up is a basic condition for long-term peace and 
stability. Only by reforming the ossified structure and 
establishing a socialist market economy structure, and 
accelerating economic development, will it be possible to 
further consolidate the socialist system and thereby essentially 
maintain stability. Thus, understanding and grasping well the 
internal relationships between stability, reform, and 
development are leadership requirements and leadership skills 
necessary for leading comrades at all levels and especially 
high-level leading comrades. 
  Upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100 
years is the political basis for maintaining stability. 
Upholding reform and opening up, engaging in economic 
construction with one heart and one mind, and taking the 
development of the social productive forces as the basic task at 
the present stage, will lay down a base for the long-term 
stability of the state. The four cardinal principles are the 
basic principles on which the state is based. They are the 
political orientation and the political principles with which we 
must be in accord in building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. If the party leaders are able to increase the 
cohesion and centripetal force of the people of all 
nationalities throughout the country, it will be a basic 
political guarantee for maintaining social stability. The 
essence of socialism is the liberating and development of the 
productive forces, the elimination of exploitation, the removal 
of polarization, and the eventual realization of common 
prosperity. This superior social system provides system 
guarantees for maintaining a stable political order and creates 
beneficial social conditions. The people's democratic 
dictatorship is a powerful guarantee and weapon for achieving 
social stability. Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is a 
powerful spiritual motivation and spiritual prop in engaging in 
socialist construction and reform. Comrade Xiaoping has fully 
affirmed that Mao Zedong Thought is still the guiding ideology 
of our party. This has major and deep significance in terms of 
maintaining the ideological unity of the whole party, in 
unifying to open up a new road for developing the socialist 
cause, and in guaranteeing that our party and state can pass the 
rigorous tests of the rapidly changing international situation. 
  In maintaining stability we must take a clear-cut stand in 
opposing bourgeois liberalization. On the subject of opposing 
bourgeois liberalization, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said much. 
He astutely pointed out: "If China engages in bourgeois 
liberalization, there will certainly be chaos, resulting in our 
being unable to achieve anything. Then, the line, principles 
and policies, and the three-stage development strategy targets 
we have formulated will all fizzle out." In his speeches while 
inspecting the south, Comrade Xiaoping also laid stress on this 
issue, pointing out: "We must continue to grasp this with both 
hands. One hand must grasp reform and opening up and one hand 
must strike at various types of economic crimes. We must 
maintain a tight grip with both these hands. In striking at 
various types of criminal activities and sweeping away various 
types of odious activities, we cannot relax our grip." In this 
respect, we must maintain an extremely clear mind. In 
accordance with the expositions by Comrade Xiaoping, in 
maintaining stability we must strengthen the building of a legal 
system, punish corruption, and carry out education in ideals, 
morality, culture, and discipline for cadres and the masses, to 
strengthen the building of spiritual civilization. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has required that "comrades working 
in the various work posts must jointly shoulder responsibility 
for safeguarding, guaranteeing, and developing this political 
situation of unity and stability." The People's Armed Forces, 
as an important component part of the state machinery, is even 
more duty-bound by this responsibility. This requires that our 
armed forces do the following: A. We must grasp the 
safeguarding of stability as a long-term political task. B. We 
must put efforts into improving the fighting strength and 
deterrent power of the armed forces. The stronger the fighting 
strength of the armed forces, the greater their deterrent effect 
on domestic and foreign enemy forces and the greater will be the 
guarantee of the security and stability of the state. Thus, it 
is necessary to centralize efforts in training the armed forces 
well, in improving the fighting strength of the armed forces, 
and in building them into a powerful, civilized, and indomitable 
army so that we can take on the glorious task of safeguarding 
national security and safeguarding social stability. C. 
Increasingly close links must be developed between the army and 
the government and between the army and the people, so as to 
form iron and steel walls for safeguarding social stability. 
Unity between the army and the government and between the army 
and the people and the unity of all nationalities are important 
safeguards for safeguarding social stability. At all times, we 
must breathe as one with the masses and share their fate, and 
maintain and bring into play the fine tradition of army-people 
unity seen during the revolutionary war years. We must 
strengthen the close links with the relevant local departments 
so that there is full army-locality cooperation, giving full 
effect to the work of maintaining stability. 
<H5>  "The Crux Lies in Doing Well in Building Our Party" by Li </H5>
Xilin [2621 1585 2651] 
  In Selected Works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly 
warns the whole party: "If problems appear in China, they will 
be the result of problems within the CPC"; "We must concentrate 
our efforts on building the party"; and "In the end, the crux 
lies in handling well the internal relations in our Communist 
Party. If there is nothing wrong there, we can relax and sleep 
easily." These conclusions by Comrade Xiaoping are a deep 
summation of experiences in international and domestic struggle, 
demonstrating the importance of strengthening the building of 
the party during the new period of reform and opening up. I 
will now discuss my understanding of this question: 
  1. Strengthen study, to raise one's own quality. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out back in 1978: 
"Realizing the four modernizations is a great and farreaching 
revolution. In this great revolution, we advance through 
continually resolving new contradictions. Thus, the comrades of 
the whole party must be good at study and be good at studying 
anew." Comrade Jiang Zemin has also repeatedly demanded that the 
whole party place importance on and strengthen study. Only if 
cadres at all levels of the party strengthen their study, will 
they be able to be in accord with the demands of international 
struggle and international competition, with the demands of 
deepening reform and modernization, and in accord with the 
higher demands which the new situation places on the leading 
groups and leading cadres at various levels. They must 
consciously implement the party's basic line, guard against the 
principle of exchange at equal value corroding inner-party 
political life, and stop corrupt actions whereby power is used 
for personal gain and whereby power is exchanged for money, to 
maintain the advanced and pure nature of Communist Party members. 
  If leading cadres are to study well, I feel that the most 
important points to stress at present are: A. It is necessary 
to recognize the promotional role which study has on work. Some 
comrades are always saying that they are busy with work and have 
arduous tasks to complete and they have no time to study. In 
fact, it is because of the work with which we are busy that we 
need to strengthen our study and raise our leadership level and 
work efficiency. We also need to do a little specific analysis 
of the term "busy." Sometimes comrades are truly busy but, at 
other times they are busy to no purpose. Leading cadres should 
centralize their energies in grasping major matters, throw off 
the fetters of minor tasks, and make time to study. Otherwise, 
even if they work harder, they will not be able to get to grips 
with the essentials and they will produce no results. B. It is 
necessary to overcome being scared of both difficulty and 
complacency. Some comrades hold that the socialist market 
economy theory is too abstruse, that modern scientific and 
technological knowledge is too unfamiliar, and that it is very 
difficult to realize any progress. Others believe that Comrade 
Xiaoping's works are easy to understand and they can be 
understood without too much effort. Thus, they are satisfied 
with a smattering of knowledge. There are different forms of 
manifestation of these two situations but actually they all 
essentially involve having low study standards and lacking a 
spirit of arduous investigation and study. C. It is necessary 
to seriously resolve psychological problems. The basic reason 
why some comrades do not continue studying and make no progress 
in their study is that their spirit is not braced and they do 
not truly use their mind in their study and work. Thus, leading 
cadres must bestir their spirits and bear in mind the great 
responsibilities they shoulder, recognize their qualitative 
deficiencies, begin by strengthening study, and continually 
raise their own abilities and levels. 
  2. Safeguarding the authority of the central authorities, 
strengthening the centralized unity of the party. 
  Safeguarding and strengthening the authority of the central 
authorities is an idea which Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always 
stressed. In response to the phenomenon whereby "when the upper 
levels promulgate a policy, the lower levels implement a 
countermeasure," he earnestly pointed out: "If reform is to be 
successful, it must be carried out in an ordered and guided 
manner. Without this, if everyone rushes in and each does his 
own thing, how can anything be achieved?" He also pointed out: 
"Without the authority of the Central Committee and the State 
Council, it will be impossible to resolve problems. With this 
authority, however, even in difficult times, major matters can 
be dealt with. We cannot negate authority and, when 
centralization is necessary, we must have centralization." At 
present, we must pay attention to resolving the following 
several questions: A. We must guard against and overcome the 
tendency whereby, as the market economy is strengthened, central 
authority is being weakened. B. We must guard against and 
overcome local protectionism. C. We must guard against and 
overcome the phenomenon whereby, using the excuse that there are 
special circumstances, localities do not implement the central 
policies and regulations. 
  3. We must firmly oppose corruption and promote a clean 
administration, to earn the trust of the people through a clean 
image. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping takes the building of clean government 
and opposition to corruption as a major matter in handling 
matters within the party properly. He has placed the greatest 
stress on this and adopts the firmest attitude regarding it. I 
believe that at present we must pay attention to three issues. 
A. We must further overcome some misunderstandings which have 
obstructed the deepening of opposition to corruption. For 
example, some people say that "there is no corruption to 
combat," others are worried that "opposition to corruption will 
affect economic growth," while yet others say that "it is 
difficult to avoid corruption," and so on. B. We must ensure 
that the activities of party committees and governments at all 
levels in opposing corruption are capable of increasing the 
people's faith in the anticorruption activities. We must act in 
accordance with the guidance by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and 
"earnestly do some things to show that we are truly combatting 
corruption and are not just playing." Especially in respect to 
"major cases," we must not "hesitate to take action" and must 
not "give people cause to think that we are shielding 
corruption." We must "call a spade a spade and deal with cases 
as they deserve to be dealt with, so that we can gain the trust 
of the masses," and we must "grasp these matters vigorously and 
speedily and advise the masses of the details." C. We must 
concern ourselves with the hardships of the masses and truly 
help them resolve the difficulties in their lives. 
  4. In accordance with the standard of requiring personnel to 
have both political integrity and skills, we must place stress 
on selecting and training successors. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping considers this to be a strategic 
question in doing well in work within the Communist Party and a 
question of importance to the overall situation. He has pointed 
out: "A correct political line needs to be guaranteed by a 
correct organizational line. Whether or not China can handle 
its affairs well, whether or not socialism and reform and 
opening up can be upheld, whether or not the economy can be 
developed a little faster, and whether or not our country can 
see long-term stability are all questions which, in a certain 
sense, depend on people." On the question of selecting and 
training successors, I believe that we must especially uphold 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal to select personnel in 
accordance with the standard that they have both political 
integrity and skills and that we firmly oppose improper 
practices in selecting and employing people. The first 
requirement is a political one. That is to say, these persons 
must have a firm faith in socialism and communism; they must 
listen to the party and safeguard the authority of the Central 
Committee; they must uphold reform and opening up and be able to 
develop and push forward; and they must be honest, fair, and 
upright and be able to maintain links with the masses. The 
other requirement is a professional one. That is to say, they 
must have abilities, including knowledge, practical experience, 
and organizational and leadership skills. We must uphold the 
cadre line of requiring justness and fairness and selecting 
persons on the basis of their merits. First, we must seek 
suitable personnel from "all corners of the land" and not just 
from those who are close to us. Second, we must implement the 
principle of party management of cadres and not allow a 
situation wherein a few persons or a single person have the say. 
Third, we must travel a mass line and not only select people on 
the basis of the feelings and perceptions of the leaders. 
  "Strengthen the Building of Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization" by Li Xinliang [2621 2450 5328] 
  In the great practice of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, material culture and spiritual culture permeate 
and promote each other. Both are indispensable elements. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, while guiding the whole party to 
centralize efforts in developing the productive forces, placed 
great stress on the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, making a number of important expositions on this 
topic. In studying the Selected Works, we come to 
deeply understand that these expositions by and requirements of 
Comrade Xiaoping have very great guiding significance in 
strengthening the building of socialist spiritual civilization 
in the new situation. 
  1. Uphold the dialectics of joint development of material 
and spiritual civilization. 
  The degree to which material civilization and spiritual 
civilization have been raised are two major indicators of human 
social progress. The socialism we want to build is socialism 
under which material civilization and spiritual civilization see 
joint development. It is because of this that Comrade Xiaoping 
has repeatedly stressed that we must uphold the policy of 
grasping with two hands and having a firm grip with both. On 
this question, for a very long period, we practiced "the 
omnipotence of the spiritual" and experienced very great 
suffering. After bringing order out of chaos, people detested 
empty prattle and respected the seeking of truth; this was 
undoubtedly progress. However, some comrades went to the other 
extreme and even abandoned lofty revolutionary ideals and the 
spirit of devotion. In studying Comrade Xiaoping's expositions 
on grasping with both hands, we have learned that, at the same 
time as upholding dialectical materialism and centralizing 
strengths in carrying out modernization, we must continually pay 
attention to strengthening the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization. In particular, in the current situation where we 
are establishing and developing a socialist market economy 
structure, while building spiritual civilization we must: 
Strengthen our initiative and bring it into play in a greater 
way; strengthen the building of party work style and clean 
government more consciously and firmly punish corruption; employ 
noble ideological culture and moral integrity in educating and 
guiding the masses; strongly publicize the spirit of 
understanding the overall situation, concerning oneself with the 
overall situation, and daring to devote oneself to the 
prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people; and 
we must advocate advanced ideas and actions, such as taking up 
cudgels for a just cause and finding pleasure in helping people, 
and so on. If we assign a high level of importance to this work 
and carry it out in an earnest manner, not only will it promote 
the smooth development of reform and economic construction but 
on the basis of new practice, we will be able to raise the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization to a new level. 
  2. Grasping the fundamentals, laying down a foundation and 
basing ourselves on educating and fostering the people. 
  The basic task in the building of spiritual civilization 
lies 
in fostering people. In this respect, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
made a series of penetrating judgements. He proposed that the 
basic issue is educating people and that our goal is to produce 
people who "have ideals and morality and who are cultured and 
disciplined." He noted that we must use Chinese history to 
educate young people and stressed that "China's development line 
established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee will require great efforts if it is to be upheld and, 
in particular, we need to educate the later generations." We 
need to seriously implement these ideas by Comrade Xiaoping and 
shoulder the work of fostering successors to the socialist cause. 
  To do well in the work of fostering and educating people, 
there are many aspects which need to be seriously improved. For 
example, in school education, in some areas, there is a serious 
imbalance between the stress placed on educational attainments 
and the inculcation of ideological and moral qualities. In some 
cases, children are, from an early age, kept in special places 
isolated from ordinary laborers. Also, some cultural publishing 
houses and mass broadcasting media, in their efforts to gain 
money, do not question whether something has socialist values or 
capitalist values. Further, guiding the broad number of young 
people to study revolutionary traditions and to get close to the 
industrial and agricultural masses, going deep into social 
practice and tempering themselves, has long been our way. 
However, suddenly no one seems to care about it now. If this 
situation continues to develop, we will not even be able to 
foster up-to-standard citizens, much less train socialist 
successors. In accordance with the requirements of Comrade 
Xiaoping, we must basically reverse this situation. Seen from 
work guidance by our leaders at various levels, the crux lies in 
truly overcoming short-term activities in grasping the building 
of spiritual civilization. Practice has proven that the period 
needed for fostering and educating people is far longer than the 
period needed for economic construction and the work is much 
more arduous. A cadre who is truly responsible to the party 
must, with the spirit of "taking 100 years to foster and educate 
people," make due contributions to training successors to the 
socialist cause. 
  3. Better implementing the duties of the armed forces in 
the building of spiritual civilization. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always placed his hopes in the 
People's Armed Forces. In the new historical period, he has 
repeatedly stressed that the Army must bring into play the old 
Red Army traditions, uphold the absolute leadership of the party 
over the Army, uphold the goal of uniting in heart and mind to 
serve the people, and maintain revolutionary ideals, 
revolutionary discipline, and the workstyle of arduous struggle. 
Since the beginning of reform and opening up, as they have 
seriously implemented these important directives by Comrade 
Xiaoping, the armed forces' work of building spiritual 
civilization has never relaxed. However, we must also soberly 
recognize that some of the negative influences in society will 
inevitably be reflected in the armed forces. Guiding the armed 
forces to maintain and strengthen a correct political 
orientation; to consciously obey the party; to safeguard the 
line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee; to establish a correct view 
of life and correct values; and to guard against corrosion by 
capitalism and the various types of decadent ideologies and 
cultures, are still major tasks facing us. 
  In accordance with the new situation, while grasping the 
building of spiritual civilization in the armed forces, we must 
maintain high standards. Our Army, as an armed group for 
implementing revolutionary political tasks, has a sacred mission 
to provide security guarantees for reform, opening up and 
economic construction. This requires that at all times it must 
maintain a high degree of centralized unity. Thus, at the same 
time as guiding the armed forces to absorb nutrition through 
actively participating in revolutionary practice, we must 
clearly stress ideals, convictions, devotion, and opposition to 
the worship of money. While establishing a concept of 
competition which is in accord with the market economy, and 
urging people to be brave in pushing forward, we must strengthen 
education regarding the need for the individual to be 
subordinated to the organization and for the partial to be 
subordinated to the whole. At the same time as respecting 
individual material interests and strengthening the concept of 
results, we must strongly foster noble moral sentiments, 
including the spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion to public 
service. We must pay attention to overcoming vulgar 
exploitation of connections and establish comrade-style links of 
mutual assistance. In brief, the more reform is deepened, the 
more we need to use the "five types of revolutionary spirit" 
advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character spirit 
of innovation and progress" advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin to 
educate the troops, so that the armed forces become a university 
for spreading the revolutionary spirit in the new period. We 
must use firm and strong action and implement the requirements 
of the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission in that, in building spiritual civilization, 
the armed forces must walk in the front ranks of the whole 
society and thereby have the army carry out its due role 
properly in the building of socialist spiritual civilization.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Solid Action Must Be Taken To Put </F>
Things in Practice"] 
  [Text] Since the 14th party congress, according to Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's idea about building the armed forces in the new 
period, the Central Military Commission has made a series of 
important policy decisions on various aspects of troop building. 
Now, as the major principles and concrete requirements have all 
been explicitly formulated, the key lies in the earnest work of 
putting them into effect. 
  Putting what has been decided into effect is the key link of 
our work in all fields. The policy decisions and principles 
laid down by the Central Military Commission, which were 
formulated on the basis of the practical experience, incorporate 
the wisdom of the masses and give expression to the objective 
laws governing the work of troop building in the new period. 
They are derived from practice, and should be returned to 
practice and be implemented in our work in all fields. Only 
thus can they play a guiding role and eventually enable us to 
achieve the purpose of our work. If the policies, principles, 
and guidelines only exist at meetings, in documents, and 
people's remarks, then they may not play any guiding role as 
they should no matter how good they are. In general, the 
situation of ensuring effective implementation of policies and 
principles is good in various units; however, formalism and red 
tape still exist in a small number of units, where routine 
ideological work and troop management are not effective enough. 
One phenomenon is particularly noteworthy. That is, some 
comrades only pay lip service to the necessity of putting what 
has been decided into effect, but their deeds vary from their 
words. Actually putting what has been decided into effect is a 
pressing task of the moment in order to strengthen troop 
building in all aspects under the new situation. 
  This is no easy matter, and requires painstaking efforts in 
many aspects. It is necessary, first of all, to adopt a correct 
guiding principle for our work. Is our work in troop building 
only aimed at showing something nice to upper leaders and thus 
seeking fame, or at actually enhancing the combat effectiveness 
of troops? The answer should be self-evident. However, some 
comrades did not adopt a correct approach to it in their 
practical work. The correct attitude is to work in a 
down-to-earth manner of being responsible to the party and the 
troops without evading problems and difficulties and without 
seeking fame for oneself and thus make painstaking efforts to 
achieve solid results every step of the way. 
  It is necessary to actually transform the style of work. We 
should work in a down-to-earth manner and advance steadily step 
by step to achieve solid results. We should actually go among 
the troops, do earnest work, speak honestly, and achieve real 
results. The window-dressing practice must not be continued, and 
there should be no more lip-service. The activities of courtesy 
should be substantially reduced, and unnecessary paperwork and 
red tape should be resolutely removed. No unrealistic slogans 
should be created, no unfeasible targets should be formulated, 
and no meetings irrelevant to implementation of the set policies 
and measures should be held. 
  It is necessary to keep a healthy state of mind. All cadres, 
especially leading cadres, should have a strong sense of 
responsibility for the cause of revolution and really 
concentrate their attention on troop building. They should be 
so absorbed in the work of troop building as to forget food and 
sleep while expected results are not achieved, and should be 
firmly resolved to achieve successful results and never give up 
halfway. They must seek no comfort and fear no hardships in 
their work, and must give no consideration to personal gains and 
losses while working perfunctorily. They must adhere to the 
high standards for troop building, and must bring their 
initiative and creativity into full play. 
  It is necessary to improve working methods. Attention should 
be paid to coordination, and priority should be given to the 
settlement of the principal contradiction. It is inadvisable to 
deal with all problems at the same time, because this will just 
make the troops work in a rush and get into a muddle. It is 
necessary to explicitly affix responsibilities to each level 
from top to bottom so that all people may perform their duties 
in an orderly manner. Effective measures for troop management 
should be maintained. For example, superficial activities among 
leaders [shang ceng huo dong 0006 1461 3172 0520] should be 
reduced, guidance should be given to various units according to 
their specific conditions. The practice of assigning leading 
cadres to various responsible positions in subordinate units in 
order to acquire work experience should be continued, and 
concrete guidance and assistance should be given to grass-roots 
cadres so that they may continue to improve their ability to put 
what is decided into effect and create more favorable conditions 
for fulfilling the tasks. 
  An important factor for putting what is decided into 
effect is the condition of grass-roots units. A good condition 
of the grass-roots units is the foundation for achieving good 
results in all aspects of troop building. At present, efforts 
should be made to ensure the implementation of the "Program for 
Building Grass-Roots Military Units." Since the promulgation of 
the revised program, all units have earnestly studied and 
implemented the document according to the spirit of the all-Army 
discussion meeting on political work at the grass-roots level, 
and the overall situation in this regard is quite good. 
However, this is just a beginning, and many issues have yet to 
be considered and solved. We must never think that we have 
almost completed everything in the implementation of the program 
after holding a meeting, issuing documents, and relaying the 
instructions of the upper leaders. We should be fully aware 
that in order to meet the general requirements of "measuring up 
to standard politically, mastering military skills proficiently, 
maintaining a fine style of work, enforcing discipline strictly, 
and guaranteeing effective logistics support" set forth by 
Chairman Jiang Zemin, the grass-roots party branches must be 
really "enhancing their quality and playing their role," and the 
leading organs should actually give guidance to the grass-roots 
units according to the requirements of the program while the 
grass-roots units are making self-enhancement. Thus, all people 
from top to bottom will have to do a great deal of work, and 
will have to make great efforts to put what has been decided 
into effect. According to instructions of the Central Military 
Commission leaders and the actual conditions of the troops, the 
leading comrade of the General Political Department reiterated 
the 10 requirements for the leading organs to serve grass-roots 
units. Leading organs at all levels must act in light of the 10 
requirements and promote better implementation of all tasks in 
grass-roots units through their earnest and wholehearted work of 
serving them. 
  When talking about the implementation of the program, 
Chairman Jiang Zemin pointed out: "All units must ensure the 
implementation and must make comprehensive progress in troop 
building at the grass-roots level." This is also the 
requirement for the implementation of the program and for troop 
work in all fields. We must positively respond to Chairman 
Jiang's call, take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the fundamental 
guideline, really create a healthy atmosphere for putting what 
has been decided into effect in the whole Army, actually 
guarantee implementation of the important policy decisions of 
the Central Military Commission, and continuously advance troop 
building in all aspects.

  [Excerpt] On the afternoon of 6 June, the Xinjiang Military 
District held a ceremonial meeting at the Bayi [1 August] Club 
to sum up the Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable communications 
project and to commend those involved in the project. Those 
attending the meeting included Fu Bingyao, deputy commander of 
the Lanzhou Military Region and commander of the Xinjiang 
Military District; Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of 
the Lanzhou Military Region and political commissar of the 
Xinjiang Military District; Wang Yousan, vice chairman of the 
Xinjiang Autonomous Region; and officers and men taking part in 
the construction of the project. 
  At the meeting, Zhou Yongshun, deputy political commissar of 
the Xinjiang Military District, read the military district's 
circular to commend and record announcements of merit for nine 
units and 10 individuals. Heads of the military district and 
leaders of Xinjiang presented awards to the units and 
individuals who rendered meritorious service and presented silk 
banners and keepsakes to units taking part in the construction 
of the project. Fang Denghua, deputy commander of the Xinjiang 
Military District and commander in chief of the optical cable 
communications project, summed up the project. He said: The 
Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable communications project is a key 
state project of the Eighth Five-Year Plan and a part of the 
continental communications bridge connecting Asia and Europe. 
Completion of the project has great significance for China's 
reform and opening up, for invigorating the economy of northwest 
China, for accelerating Xinjiang's development, and for 
preserving Xinjiang's social stability. The Xinjiang Military 
District dispatched nearly 10,000 officers and men and more than 
600 vehicles and other equipment to dig trenches for laying the 
880-km long optical cables. The troops taking part in the 
construction work, in keeping the overall situation in mind, 
earnestly practiced the five kinds of revolutionary spirit 
advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character 
enterprising spirit advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They 
worked diligently under extremely difficult conditions, which 
enabled them to complete the project 45 days ahead of schedule 
and thus accomplish a miracle in the construction of the 
country's communication projects. [passage omitted]

Proposes Using Foreign Capital To Reform State-Owned 
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 1 Jun (TA KUNG PAO)--Mainland China's 
reform and opening up has already entered a new period, and the 
way to invigorate and properly run state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises has become a focus of attention. From 
27 to 30 May, the "Seminar on Use of Foreign Capital To Reform 
State-Owned Enterprises and on the `China Strategic Investment 
Limited' Phenomenon," was held in Hangzhou, nearly 100 experts 
and scholars from Chinese government departments, economic 
circles, and news circles gathered together to seek proper ways 
to reform state-owned enterprises and discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages of the joint reform efforts by Hong Kong's China 
Strategic Investment Limited and the mainland's state-owned 
enterprises in recent years. They unanimously thought that one 
effective ways to invigorate state-owned enterprises is to use 
foreign capital to reform them. 
  The seminar was jointly proposed and organized by the 
Zhejiang Province Committee for Restructuring Economy, 
Zhejiang's GAIGE YUEKAN [Reform Monthly], and ZHEJIANG JINGJI 
BAO. Among of those attending the seminar were An Zhiwen, 
president of the Society for Research on Restructuring the 
Economic System; Wang Yuzhao, Standing Committee member of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and vice chairman of the Economy 
Committee of the CPPCC; Liu Guoguang, vice president of the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Yang Qixian, vice president 
of the Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System; 
Huang Daoxia, researcher at the State Council's Development 
Research Center; and economics professors and theorists from 
various universities, including Fang Sheng, Wang Jue, Zhong 
Mingrong, Wei Jie, and Liu Wei, in addition to journalists from 
some 20 central, provincial, and city news organizations. Yang 
Bin, vice chairman of Zhejiang Province People's Congress, 
Hangzhou Mayor Wang Yongming, and Lu Yongxiang, member of the 
CPC Central Committee and president of Zhejiang University, also 
attended the seminar. 
  Huang Hong-nien, chairman of the broad of directors of China 
Strategic Investment Limited in Hong Kong, and the persons in 
charge of the joint-venture enterprises set up by the company on 
the mainland, also came to the seminar to hear expert opinions 
and give briefings on the great changes in joint-venture 
enterprises after their company injected funds into them. They 
cited a series of figures and facts to illustrate that 
importation of foreign capital has not only enabled state-owned 
enterprises to change mechanisms, but also promoted 
technological transformation and reform of management systems in 
the enterprises, aroused workers' enthusiasm for production, and 
enabled enterprises to swiftly stop losses, earn profits, and 
have marked economic returns. 
  Wei Jie, a professor from the People's University of China, 
fully affirmed the "China Strategic Investment Limited 
phenomenon" from the perspective of development of productive 
forces. He pointed out that when the shares of state-owned 
enterprises are controlled by foreign investors, state assets, 
enterprises, entrepreneurs, and the labor force have their 
positions fixed, then the big problem which has hindered 
state-owned enterprises for a long time, namely mixing up of 
government and enterprises and separation of authority and duty, 
has been solved. 
  Professor Wang Jue from the Central Party School thought 
that 
the "China Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" is not 
accidental, but is an inevitable phenomenon in the course of 
deepening of reform of state-owned enterprises. An absolute 
majority of the state-owned enterprises taken over by China 
Strategic Investment Limited for reform have cast off poverty 
and embarked upon the road of development and have changed 
losses to profits; this is good for individuals, collectives, 
and the state as well, and this has provided a lot of 
enlightenment about the reform of state-owned enterprises. He 
also said that the reform of state-owned enterprises is now an 
urgent task, and that if initiative is still not actively taken, 
then many state-owned enterprises will collapse. After carrying 
out enterprise reform, other steps such as financial and 
taxation reforms must be swiftly implemented, otherwise the 
functions of enterprises after reform cannot be further 
developed. 
  Wang Yuzhao, vice chairman of the CPPCC Economic Committee, 
said when he addressed the seminar that the crux of the current 
difficult situation of state-owned enterprises is a system 
problem and the basic way out is a reform of the system. 
Therefore, borrowing the strong points from the enterprises 
under non-state-owned system, especially non-public-owned 
system, to reform state-owned enterprises, should be an 
important way to invigorate state-owned enterprises. The "China 
Strategic Investment Limited phenomenon" is precisely this kind 
of exploration and creation. Its practice has helped 
enterprises clarify property rights, promoted separation of 
government from enterprises, expedited enterprise technological 
transformation, upgraded the degree of enterprise participation 
in the international market, and, at the same time, maintained a 
dominant position of party work. At present, society has 
different opinions on the "China Strategic Investment Limited 
phenomenon," but this situation is not strange at all. Since 
reform and opening up, no innovative practice has avoided 
causing controversy and criticism. However, an innovation which 
has real vitality is not afraid of controversy and criticism. 
  During the seminar, the experts and scholars also visited 
China Strategic Hangzhou Brewery Company Limited and China 
Strategic Hangzhou Rubber Company Limited, to examine the 
changes and benefits brought about by importation of foreign 
funds to these enterprises.

<F P=106> [Article by Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "The Party and </F>
Government Are Concerned About Coal Enterprises' Difficulties; 
Help Them Clear Up Debts"] 
  [Text] According to the Ministry of Coal Industry, serious 
defaulting by users of coal for some time have caused funding 
tensions among coal enterprises and have rendered a small number 
of these enterprises unable to pay their employees' wages. The 
party Central Committee and the State Council have attached 
great importance to and shown great concern for the coal 
industry's plight, listened to many reports from the Ministry of 
Coal Industry, and adopted a series of effective measures one 
after another, thus alleviating funding tensions among coal 
mines to a great extent. 
  The measures included: 1) The state allocated 4 billion yuan 
in loans and funds to help coal enterprises clear payments 
defaulted on by users. So far 2.2 billion yuan has been 
collected. 2) The state appropriately lowered value-added tax 
rate on coal enterprises; thus, the value-added rate on coal 
products has dropped from 17 percent to 13 percent. Moreover, 
state financial departments offered an additional 1.71 billion 
yuan in subsidies to prevent an increased tax burden on key 
state-owned coal mines. 3) Coal prices were raised 
appropriately. 4) Settlement methods for payments for coal were 
changed to avoid the occurrence of new debts, while previous 
debts have just been cleared up. 5) The state will continue to 
provide coal mines with 2 billion yuan in loans at discount 
interest rates and will support coal enterprises in developing 
diverse economic undertakings and tertiary industry and finding 
jobs for excess personnel. 
  Thanks to support given by the state and efforts exerted by 
coal enterprises' employees, the reform of China's coal industry 
has maintained a good momentum and has continued to advance. 
From January to May this year, the country's raw coal output 
amounted to 416 million tonnes, an increase of 2.18 percent over 
the same period last year, and the demands placed on coal by the 
rapid growth of the national economy was thus guaranteed; the 
number of deaths and injuries in the country caused by mine 
accidents this year dropped by 0.6 percent from the 
corresponding period last year; and the fulfillment of targets 
to reduce losses and increase profits has continued to improve 
steadily month after month.

<F P=106> [By reporter He Tianwen (0149 1131 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Guiyang, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to information 
released by a national seminar on aiding the poor through 
transportation and communication projects held by the Ministry 
of Communications in Guiyang recently, the state will invest 1 
billion yuan annually -- for a seven-year period starting this 
year until the turn of the century -- to provide relief in the 
form of jobs on key highway construction projects in 21 
provinces and autonomous regions in west-central China to change 
the backwardness of impoverished areas. 
  Since reform and opening up, particularly since the 
mid-eighties, transportation and communication departments have, 
with the full support of the state, built more than 44,000 km of 
new highways which were up to prescribed grades and standards, 
and more than 42,000 km of new roads for use by farm machines. 
They have repaired more than 64,000 km of off-grade highways, 
built over 8,500 new bridges, harnessed more than 700 km of 
waterways, and connected over 1,500 towns and townships and more 
than 10,000 administrative villages by highways. These projects 
have played an important role in developing the economy of 
poverty-ridden areas and in solving people's food and clothing 
problems. 
  Nevertheless, more than 1,700 towns and townships and over 
17,000 administrative villages nationwide have not yet been 
connected by highways and thus are inaccessible by car. Most of 
these townships and villages, which are not connected by 
highways, are located in poor areas in west-central China. 
Accordingly, the State Council has decided to use newly 
allocated work-relief funds this year, mainly to launch 
communications projects in impoverished areas. Working around 
the central task of economic development, the state will build 
roads leading to townships, interconnected highways, highways 
leading to rural trade fairs and commodity distribution centers, 
and "truncated" highways [highways cut short and diverted to 
other directions], while paying equal attention to the problem 
of drinking water for human and animal consumption in areas with 
serious water shortages. 
  A relevant responsible person from the State Council's 
Leading Group for Aid-the-Poor Projects noted: The state's 
investment of massive work-relief funds to improve 
communications conditions in poverty-stricken areas is an 
important part of our country's key "87" aid-the-poor program [a 
program under which 80 million households will be lifted out of 
poverty within seven years]. Therefore, we should genuinely 
stress investment returns, ensuring that every road which we 
start building will be completed, and that every road which we 
build will lead to prosperity. We must not rush headlong into 
action and start projects indiscriminately.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In view of 
the fact that the legitimate rights and interests of workers and 
staff of foreign-funded enterprises are ignored and infringed 
upon, the mainland's All-China Federation of Trade Unions has 
repeatedly called on foreign-funded enterprises to make proper 
arrangement for working hours and respect worker and staff 
personal freedoms. Not long ago, labor disputes repeatedly 
broke out in foreign-funded enterprises, and some workers and 
staff even went on strike. Hence, the National People's 
Congress (NPC) started deliberating the "Labor Law" from April 
and is prepared to push the establishment of trade unions in 
foreign-funded enterprises within this year with a view to 
developing them into buffer organizations safeguarding worker 
and staff rights and interests and settling labor disputes. 
  It was reported that from 1979 onwards, there are a total of 
more than 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises (including joint 
ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises, and enterprises 
solely invested by foreign businesses) with a real investment of 
$60 billion by Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and overseas businesses. 
It should be said that these foreign-funded enterprises have 
played a very great role in the mainland's economic construction 
and employment and brought about economic prosperity in various 
localities. 
  However, foreign-funded enterprises have also caused many 
problems. In recent years, cases of employer infringement of 
workers' rights and interests and personal freedom frequently 
occurred. For example, in a Taiwanese-funded shoe-making 
factory in Fujian Province, Taiwanese businessmen surnamed Chang 
and Chen tied up and violently beat a female worker surnamed Yu 
who had stolen two pairs of shoes. Later, they even put the 
shoes up around her neck before the public and then locked her 
in a big iron cage, thus arousing public indignation. In 
another example, a piece of jewelry was lost in a joint-venture 
jewelry factory in Zhangjiang Township in Shanghai's Pudong New 
Area, the boss went so far as to order all female workers to 
take off their clothes so body searches could be made. In 
another case, a foreign-funded factory in Tianjin went so far as 
to issue "toilet-going cards" to workers and staff and 
stipulated that every worker could only go to the toilet for 
five minutes and anyone violating this rule would be fined. All 
these cases were violations of worker and staff personal dignity 
which contravened mainland labor decrees. 
  Meanwhile, foreign employers of foreign-funded enterprises 
arbitrarily ordered workers and staff to work overtime with 
little or no overtime payment. In some cases, workers who had 
worked overtime till the early morning on the next day had to go 
to work as usual on that day. It is a widespread phenomenon in 
various localities that workers frequently work 12 to 16 hours 
in a row. According to the regulations, if workers go to work on 
statutory paid holidays, such as the New Year's Day and National 
Day, factory employers should pay them 50 percent or even 100 
percent more than their daily wages. However, workers and staff 
in foreign-funded enterprises do not enjoy this benefit. In 
this way, labor disputes frequently break out. 
  In addition, in order to seek superprofits, some Hong Kong 
and Taiwanese businesses often find ways to cut down worker and 
staff pay when enterprise interests come into conflict with that 
of workers and staff, such as using factory discipline and rules 
to hold down or deduct worker and staff pay. For example, 
although an eight-hour work system has been set as a mainland 
rule and Sundays are fixed as rest days, many foreign-funded 
enterprises stipulate in private that workers and staff must 
work overtime unconditionally, otherwise they will be punished 
and their pay will be deducted for staying away from work 
without good reason. In the "staff rules" set by a 
foreign-funded enterprise in Guangdong, as many as 46 of them 
are related to pay deductions and fines, and 80 percent of the 
workers and staff are punished every month! 
  Even more serious is that many small and medium-sized 
foreign-funded factories generally neglect labor safety and lack 
protective equipment and fire prevention facilities. 
Consequently, accidents occur again and again. Last year, when 
two factories run by Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses in 
Shenzhen and Fuzhou caught fire, workers could not escape 
because there were inadequate fire safety facilities and the 
front and back doors were locked, thus causing serious 
casualties. 
  After receiving many complaints from workers and staff of 
foreign-funded enterprises, last December the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions openly called on departments 
concerned to take measures to protect the personal safety and 
legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff of 
foreign-funded enterprises. By the end of last April, the 
mainland Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Public Security, and the 
All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued a circular 
strictly prohibiting foreign-funded and private enterprises from 
restricting worker and staff personal freedom by locking and 
shutting workshops and worker and staff living quarters. 
Enterprises committing criminal offenses will be investigated 
by judicial organs to see whether they have criminal 
responsibility. 
  Before and after the NPC deliberated the "Labor Law" last 
April, Guangdong and some other provinces and municipalities 
responded to the call and made preparations for helping 
foreign-funded enterprises set up trade unions. The trade 
unions can be considered as organizations negotiating with 
employers on improving labor conditions, safety facilities, and 
pay and welfare, and as the buffer zone of labor disputes to 
prevent workers and staff from going on strike because of undue 
demands and to protect employers' and employees' justifed rights 
and interests.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade </F>
and economic cooperation, by reporter Zheng Zhihai (6774 1807 
3189); date, place not given: "Wu Yi on Reform of Foreign Trade 
System, Seizing the Opportunity To Increase Exports"] 
  [Text] Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi said in a recent 
interview with this reporter that we must deepen the reform of 
our foreign trade system and seize the rare historical 
opportunity to advance our export work to a new level. 
  Wu Yi said: The reform of our foreign trade system is an 
important component of our economic restructuring and has been 
implemented at a rapid pace for quite a long time. Following 
bold reforms at three stages over the past 15 years, we started 
a new round of reform this year, with the unification of 
exchange rates at the core. The core of this round of reform is 
that the state is to implement a unified foreign exchange 
settlement and selling system in foreign trade export 
enterprises, set up a unitary and managed renminbi floating 
exchange rate system on the basis of market demand and supply, 
and abolish foreign trade enterprises' task of turning over 
foreign exchange to the higher authorities with or without 
compensation. 
  Viewed from the experience and practice of foreign trade 
development and reform over the past years, we really grasp the 
key when introducing the new round of foreign trade reform 
measures, particularly the reform of the exchange rate system 
under the current situation. Compared with the past reform 
measures, these measures have made a major breakthrough in such 
respects as unifying policy, lifting restrictions on operation, 
bearing responsibility for profits and losses, and promoting 
fair competition, all of which will effectively solve some of 
the deep-seated problems that have been disrupting our foreign 
trade development for a long time, thus helping our foreign 
trade system run in accordance with standard international 
practice, helping foreign trade enterprises take part in the 
international division of labor and exchange in a broader and 
more profound way, developing an open economy, and linking and 
supplementing our domestic economy with the international 
economy. 
  Wu Yi said: In the future, our foreign trade and economic 
cooperation must develop according to a new "large-scale 
economic and trade" pattern, that is, linking foreign trade and 
economic cooperation with foreign investment; merging barter 
trade, technology trade, and service trade into a single whole; 
integrating commodities, capital, technology, and labor; and 
combining industry, agriculture, technology, and commerce with 
one another in trade. In the third volume of his selected 
works, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that our total foreign trade 
volume would reach $200 billion by the end of this century, and 
we must fulfill that task this year, which is six years earlier. 
Not long ago, Premier Li Peng proposed that by the year of 
2000, our total foreign trade volume must reach $400 billion, 
which would double this year's figure. This is quite an arduous 
task. With the end of the Cold War, the competition of 
comprehensive national strength will occupy a leading position. 
In the 1990's, worldwide economic competition will become more 
intense, and a "commercial war" awaits us which has a strong 
smell of gunpowder, but no smoke,. Faced with this historical 
opportunity, the success of the reform of our foreign trade 
system relates not only to whether or not a new foreign trade 
system can be established, but also to whether or not a 
socialist market economy system can be established at an early 
date and can run normally. At present, first, we must handle 
well the relationship between the reform of our foreign trade 
system and the task of expanding exports to earn more foreign 
exchange. Second, we must handle well the relationship between 
reform and maintaining the order of foreign trade operation, 
Third, we must handle well the relationship between the reform 
of our foreign trade system and other reforms. Fourth, we must 
handle well the problem of converging the old and the new 
systems in the process of transformation. In short, in 
deepening the reform of our foreign trade system, we should set 
the task of boosting exports as the most important one, and 
should try every possible means to advance it to a new level so 
as to promote the full development of foreign trade and to make 
new progress.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The other 
day, when talking about reform of the commercial circulation 
system, China's Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo said: 
It is imperative to draw on the experience and practice of the 
world business community and energetically develop chain-store 
businesses in China. In particular, an important step will be 
taken to introduce foreign funded and operated chain stores this 
year. 
  Zhang Haoruo said: China will pursue a macropolicy of 
walking on two legs in running its chain-store businesses. One 
of the legs is to bring in foreign capital and make vigorous 
efforts to run chain stores, which means policies governing 
Chinese-foreign joint retail operations will be relaxed further. 
He was certain that this measure would promote the renewal of 
China's traditional mode of commercial operations to a great 
extent and would speed up the reorganization and reconstruction 
of China's commercial system. 
  The second leg is to use large and medium-sized cities as 
the 
basis, choose some solid commercial enterprises as the core, and 
reorganize and develop chain-store business and chain-store 
groups with Chinese characteristics. 
  This senior official in charge of internal trade revealed 
that China is, taking sight of reality, actively communicating 
with major chain-store operators abroad. It will draw 
inspiration from the free and franchise chain-store practices of 
Japan and Southeast Asian countries. As long as conditions are 
adequate, restaurants, supermarkets, fast food shops, garment 
shops, optical shops, Chinese and Western medical pharmacies, 
bookstores, photo processing companies, and jewelry shops may 
all consider operating chain stores.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 June (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According 
to an authoritative person, to bring the economy in line with 
the international economy, China will allow the entry of foreign 
capital into service and trade sectors, including banking, 
insurance, accounting and auditing, medical care and insurance, 
advertising, petroleum-related services, property development, 
and transport. 
  Moreover, it also will allow investment of foreign capital, 
in the form of Sino-foreign joint ventures, in the following 
nine services, including technological measurement and analysis 
services and related scientific and technological consultancy; 
equipment maintenance and support services related to 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries; computer 
system design; and repair services for office facilities and 
equipment. Meanwhile, it will also allow foreign capital to 
invest in the construction, transformation, and operation of 
hotels and restaurants in the form of Sino-foreign joint 
ventures. 
  In commercial retail trade, China has agreed that Beijing, 
Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, Qingdao, and the five 
special economic zones may each trial-launch one or two 
Sino-foreign joint-venture or cooperative commercial retail 
enterprises. In foreign trade, China has decided to allow 
foreign businessmen to engage in entrepot trade in the bonded 
zone of Shanghai's New Pudong district and to become agents for 
the import and export business of foreign-invested enterprises 
in the zone, and it has also decided to conduct experiments in 
developing joint-venture projects in scientific publishing and 
economic information publishing. China will also allow foreign 
capital to set up representative offices for legal services in 
China and to set up taxation service representative offices in 
the country's economically developed regions. This move will be 
conducive to China's resumption of GATT membership and entry to 
the World Trade Organization.

  [Text] Beijing (CEIS) -- A senior official with the 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
(MOFTEC) has explained China's basic policies for using foreign 
lendings and investments. 
  Highlights of the basic policies, announced by MOFTEC 
Assistant Minister Liu Xiangdong at a recent seminar on China's 
economic reform policies here, are as follows: 
  -- To attract foreign lendings and direct investments by 
various methods and through various channels. 
  While continuing to accept investments by foreign small and 
medium-sized enterprises, China will make efforts to attract 
more direct investments by transnational companies. 
  While using foreign direct investments, the country will 
continue to apply for foreign loans, especially loans from 
foreign governments and international financial institutions 
under favorable terms. 
  -- To continue carrying out the current preferential 
policies 
for encouraging foreign direct investment. 
  -- To open more new fields to foreign direct investments. 
  The fields open to foreign investors will be extended from 
the production sector to the circulation sector, with the 
opening up of nine new fields, namely, retailing, foreign trade 
(limited to bonded areas in the beginning), communications and 
transport, civil aviation, finance, tourism, real estate, 
culture and education, and social services. 
  Meanwhile, China will further encourage foreign investment 
in 
projects related to energy, communications, basic industries and 
infrastructure, those to introduce advanced foreign technology, 
upgrade products, cut energy consumption and expand production 
capacity, those to promote China's exports, those to produce new 
equipment, new materials and products not available in China, 
and those to fully or mainly produce exports with major imported 
raw materials and also without quota limitation. 
  Projects to do harm to social security, national economic 
development, environment, natural resources and human health 
will be barred from entering the country. 
  -- To guide foreign investments to expected industries by 
granting inclined policies for industries, rather than for 
regions as has been practiced in the past. Foreign-invested 
technology-intensive projects and new and hi-tech projects that 
are encouraged by the state and involve large amounts of 
investment will be offered some domestic markets, so as to make 
them help upgrade the related domestic industries. 
  -- To improve administration over foreign-invested 
enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China's exports have 
been growing faster than imports in the first five months of 
this year. 
  Exports were 24.1 percent up on the same period last year, 
while imports were just 18.1 higher than those 1993 months, 
according to the latest figures from China's Customs Department. 
  During this period, China's foreign trade volume totalled 
76.77 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 21.1 percent over the 
same period last year. 
  Exports, at 37.49 billion U.S. dollars, showed a steeper 
rise 
(24.1 percent) for the whole of the five-month period than they 
had shown in the first four months (22 percent). 
  Imports for the five months totalled 39.28 billion U.S. 
dollars, a rise of 18.1 percent over the same period last year. 
This was a lower growth rate than in the first four 1994 
months, when it was 20.4 percent. 
  During the first five months, China's foreign trade deficit 
reached 1.79 billion U.S. dollars, 1.27 billion U.S. dollars 
less than in the same period last year.

  [Text] China's foreign trade has continued its 
double-digit growth in the first five months this year, to reach 
$76.77 billion, up 21.1 per cent over the same period last year, 
Customs officials said yesterday. 
  The export growth rate grew faster than that of imports, 
indicating that the ongoing reform to put the foreign trade 
system in line with international practice is paying off, 
according to officials in the General Administration of Customs 
(GAC). 
  Although China still saw a trade deficit of $1.79 billion 
during the period, it was $1.27 billion less than that in first 
five months of last year. 
  During the January-May period, China's total imports grew by 
18.1 per cent, amounting to $39.28 billion. The growth rate was 
slower than it was in the first four months of this year. 
Exports reached $37.49 billion, 24.1 per cent up. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises continued to set the pace in 
trade, as their exports and imports reached $28.29 billion, a 
43.4 per cent increase over the same period last year and 
accounting for nearly 37 per cent of the national trade volume. 
  The mix of China's exports continued its improvement as 
manufactured products witnessed a sharp rise of 27.6 per cent to 
$31.05 billion, accounting for more than 82 per cent of all 
exports. 
  Garments and textiles still topped the exports list, 
recording a 32 and 27 per cent lift with a volume of $7.76 
billion and $3.78 billion respectively, while machinery and 
electronics witnessed a rise of 30.1 per cent, totalling $9.27 
billion.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In order 
to strengthen price management over import and export trade, the 
relevant department of the Chinese Government recently adopted 
some new measures. 
  According to ZHONGGUO XINXI BAO, the new measures mainly 
include three points: 
  First, improving the import agent system. Necessary 
production materials and such important livelihood materials as 
grain, the prices of which are higher on the international 
market than on the domestic, should be imported through 
comprehensive regulations. While the import of such goods is 
guaranteed, their impact on domestic prices should be reduced. 
New management methods should be studies for importing major 
commodities. For example, such methods as setting up united 
agents and formulating average prices for agents may be adopted. 
  Second, adopting the policy of encouraging exports and 
foreign exchange earning. The principles for export price 
management are: Promoting the increase in foreign exchange 
earnings through exports and export-oriented production, 
improving the export structure, enhancing the economic results 
of export trade, putting a stop to the phenomena of dumping at 
low prices in the export market and bidding up the prices in the 
domestic market. The domestic purchase price ceiling for major 
export goods should be based on international market prices, and 
the floor-level protective price should be formulated according 
to domestic production costs. 
  Third, the exchange rate adjustment mechanism should be 
improved so that the impact of exchange rate changes on domestic 
prices can be brought under control. In the future, exchange 
rates should be determined not only by the costs of exports; 
consideration also should be giving to both imports and exports, 
as well as to non-trade projects.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Exchange Rate Reform Won't Hurt Imports"] </F>
  [Text] The unification of China's dual track exchange rate 
will not affect the volume of the country's imports, said a 
foreign trade official. 
  As the nation continues to develop, there will be an 
increase 
in both exports and imports, said Liu Xiangdong, Vice-Minister 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. 
  Liu told an economic reform seminar at the 5th Asia-Pacific 
International Trade Fair that China is keen to increase its 
export earnings in order to import more advanced technology, 
equipment and materials needed for the country's modernization 
drive. 
  Import costs, tariffs and turnover tax have increased in 
line 
with the unification of the exchange rates, he said. 
  But imports will not be affected because the current 
exchange 
rate is similar to the old swap market rate used to calculate 80 
per cent of the imports. 
  And the State has increased its budget to subsidize the 
remaining 20 per cent of the imports using the old official 
exchange rate. 
  And to counteract the slight increase in tariffs and 
turnover 
tax the State has this year reduced tariff rates of 2,898 import 
items by an average of 8.8 per cent. 
  Moreover, with China's impending re-entry of the General 
Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the overall level of 
import tariffs will be reduced by 50 per cent compared with 1992 
levels. 
  In a separate development, Yu Xiaosong, vice-minister of the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, told the seminar that the 
Chinese government is formulating policies to encourage foreign 
investment with special focus on China's key industries. 
  Yu said the government will grant preferential treatment to 
foreign investment in the development and construction of basic 
industries and infrastructure such as transportation, 
communications, energy, key raw materials, agriculture and water 
conservancy.

  [Text] Beijing (CEIS) -- Chinese authorities are working 
out detailed provisions governing the transfer of equity in 
state-owned enterprises to foreign investors, according to a 
senior official. 
  In selling off the country's state-owned enterprises to 
foreigners, Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, said recently that limitation should be 
imposed in two areas. 
  One is that asset evaluation must be conducted by a 
qualified 
evaluation organization before a state-owned enterprise is to 
transfer part or all of its equities to a foreign investor, 
which is a new form for China to attract foreign direct 
investments. 
  Yu said such evaluation is necessary as there is not yet a 
fair and scientific method. 
  The other aspect concerns whether or not one or a group of 
foreign investors is allowed to buy all stakes or a holding 
stake in a Chinese state-owned enterprise. 
  And this depends on the status and function of the 
enterprise 
in China's national economy, yu added. 
  Such takeovers are not proper for important large 
state-owned 
enterprises, a large power plant for instance, which will 
trigger such problems as electricity supply, charges and 
production capacity, Yu said. 
  Yu said the Chinese partner's stake in a large state 
enterprise must be higher than 50 percent regardless of the 
number of shareholders in the enterprise.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 7 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Guangdong 
is continuing its macrocontrol over the real estate industry. 
From now on, the provincial government will not grant approval 
for the establishment of property development companies or the 
requisition of land for real estate projects. 
  State macrocontrol, through controlling the total volume of 
credit over the last year, has brought thousands of property 
development companies across the province to understand a grim 
fact: Property development companies which have an ample supply 
of capital and whose projects meet market needs can gain the 
initiative in market competition, while those which rely only on 
bank loans for their existence and are interested in building 
luxury villas or residential units will just go bust. 
  Statistics provided by the provincial construction 
commission 
show that property investment increased by 230 percent in 1992 
over the previous year, the 1993 figure was 1.3 times that of 
1992, and that property investment across the province in 1993 
accounted for 37.5 percent of total infrastructure investment, 
clearly indicating the excessive scale of property development. 
Experts say, after analysis, that even if new projects are not 
undertaken, it will take the market several years to absorb 
existing real estate projects. 
  Guangdong will not undertake any real estate projects this 
year. Those property development enterprises which are suffering 
from stockpiles of land will be required to transfer some of 
their land to property development companies which have abundant 
capital but no land, projects under construction will be 
continued or suspended depending on market requirements, and 
completed houses should be sold as soon as possible to recover 
capital for new development projects.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In recent 
years, Beijing Municipality has set up a batch of enterprises 
abroad, some of which have already cut a fine figure in the 
intensely competitive international business world. It is 
learned that at present, Beijing has 158 wholly foreign-funded, 
joint-venture, or cooperative enterprises and organizations 
abroad. 
  These overseas enterprises and organizations are distributed 
over 45 countries and regions. Among them, 32 are in developed 
countries and 126 in developing countries. Their investments 
cover many fields, such as industrial and agricultural 
production, exploitation of natural resources, general trade, 
banking and real estate, tourist service, medical care, project 
contracting, and landscaping and architecture. 
  In Malaysia, an overseas enterprise mainly formed by the 
Beijing Municipal Building Works Group and the International 
Economic Cooperation Company has developed into quite a strong 
project contractor there. Its business ranges from undertaking 
residential district projects to building four-star hotels and 
from constructing exclusive apartment blocks to building factory 
facilities. Its annual business volume approximates $100 
million. 
  In Japan, the Jinglian Company reaped 27 billion yen of 
turnover in 1993 and made a profit of 120 million yen, ranking 
among 30,000 enterprises with good credit standing in Japan. 
  As a leader in exploring international real estate business, 
the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Development and Management 
Corporation has set up many companies in the United States, 
Australia, Hong Kong, and Macao since it was founded in 1992. 
Despite the adversities brought on by the continuing recession 
in the Western economy and the real estate industry on a 
downward path, they have managed to get a preliminary foothold 
and shown relatively good economic performance. 
  The development and expansion of these overseas enterprises 
have added a new dimension to the municipality's effort to 
broaden the international market and strengthen itself with 
overseas resources.

<F P=106> [By Qin Yucai (4440 3768 2088) of the Investment Department </F>
of State Planning Commission: "Maintain Reasonable Increase in 
Agricultural Investment"] 
  [Text] Agriculture is the foundation of the national 
economy. Only by consolidating agriculture and stabilizing rural 
areas can the whole country maintain stability, the reform 
proceed smoothly, and the economy attain sustained, fast, and 
healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] 
development. Therefore, energetically increasing the 
comprehensive production capacity of agriculture, maintaining 
rational increases in agricultural investment, and stabilizing 
agricultural development is a major task concerning the 
country's overall interests. 
  Problems in agriculture have many causes, one of which is 
inadequate input. It is a rather complicated problem that has 
cropped up in the process of deepening economic structural 
reform. 
  1. Proportion of investments in agricultural capital 
construction: 
  If calculated according to industry statistics, investment 
in 
agricultural capital construction from the First through the 
Fifth Five-Year Plans was 77.543 billion yuan and the average 
ratio of investment in agricultural capital construction to 
total investment in capital construction nationwide was 10.5 
percent; in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the figure was 17.284 
billion yuan, 5.1 percent; in the Seventh Five-Year Plan, 30.393 
billion yuan, 3.3 percent; in 1991, 8.5 billion yuan, 4.0 
percent; in 1992, 11.27 billion yuan, 3.7 percent; and in 1993, 
13.69 billion yuan, 4.4 percent. 
  The following three reasons mainly contributed to the 
decrease in the proportion of investment in agricultural capital 
construction: 
  First, the sources of capital construction investment 
changed, investors were more varied, and the proportion of state 
budgetary investment significantly dropped. From the First 
through the Fifth Five-Year Plans, the sources of funds for 
investment in capital construction by the state lacked variety 
and the state budgetary investment accounted for 80-90 percent. 
But since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, channels for pooling funds 
for investment in capital construction have increased, 
extra-budgetary investment (including bank loans, foreign 
capital utilized, and self-raised funds) has gone up 
considerably, and the proportion of budgetary investment by the 
state has dropped tremendously. Consequently, the ratio of 
investment in agricultural to total investment in capital 
construction diminished. 
  Second, fields for investment expanded. Since the Sixth 
Five-Year Plan, with the national economy moving ahead, the 
expansion of new domains for industrial investment, such as 
petrochemicals, chemicals, electronics, and new materials, have 
caused a comparative reduction of the percentage of agricultural 
investment, but investment in industries that aid agriculture 
has increased. 
  Third, after the proportion of budgetary investment in 
agriculture dropped, other financing channels have gradually 
come into play. Apart from investment in capital construction, 
over 15 billion yuan of fiscal and bank loans have been put into 
agriculture each year. Therefore, though the absolute figure of 
investment in agricultural capital construction has been rising 
every year over the past few years, it has been very hard for 
the proportion of investment in agricultural capital 
construction to go up as a result of the increased variety of 
investment channels. 
  2. Measures taken in 1994 for to increase the percentage of 
investment in agricultural capital construction controlled by 
the central authorities: 
  Increasing budgetary input and input of bank loans. In 1994, 
central budgetary investment nationwide increased by 3 billion 
yuan, of which 650 million yuan was allocated to agriculture, 
taking up 21.7 percent of the total increase. Bank credit 
increased by 19.8 billion yuan (with 13 billion yuan of new 
loans), of which 2.1 billion yuan was allocated to agriculture, 
taking up 10.6 percent of the total increase (or 16.2 percent of 
the total value of new loans. 
  In 1994, budgetary investment in agricultural capital 
construction and bank credit arranged by the central government 
registered 10.485 billion yuan, up 35.6 percent over the 1993 
figure of 7.735 billion yuan. The increase was 12.9 percentage 
points, higher than comparable increase rates in all other 
industries and trades arranged by the central government. 
  In 1994, the ratio of the budgetary investment in 
agriculture 
and bank credit arranged by the central government to nationwide 
investment and bank loans budgeted by the central government was 
8.5 percent, 0.8 percentage point higher than the 1993 
percentage of 7.7. 
  3. Aside from direct investment in agriculture, forestry, 
and water resources, favorable arrangements have also been made 
for the investment in such agriculture-aiding industries as 
chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, plastic sheeting, farm 
machines, and electric supply for agriculture. 
  4. Investment by local governments, collectives, and 
individuals should also be increased gradually. Local 
governments should assume the bulk of the responsibility for 
investment in agricultural capital construction, while central 
government investment should concentrate on core projects for 
harnessing major rivers and lakes that cover a number of 
provinces or regions, the construction of large agricultural 
commodities and shelter-forests, and the development of 
scientific research institutes serving the whole country and 
institutions of higher learning. It is necessary to take 
effective measures to guide peasants to increase productive 
input in agriculture.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Total output in each 
category of meat, eggs, aquatic products and vegetables has 
increased 50 to 80 percent over the 1987 figures. 
  In an interview with XINHUA reporters, the director of the 
All-China Office of the Shopping Basket Project Tang Yong said 
that thanks to the efforts of the project, citizens' consumption 
of non-staple foods has greatly increased. 
  The project began seven years ago with the aim to ensure 
supplies of vegetables, meat, eggs and other non-staple foods 
for large and medium-sized cities. 
  Since 1987, per capita consumption of meat in China has 
increased from 18.4 kg to 32.1 kg, of eggs from 5.5 kg to 9.3 
kg, of aquatic products from 8.8 kg to 15.2 kg, and of 
vegetables from 135.3 kg to 186.7 kg. 
  Tang said that China's citizens now consume more diversified 
kinds of non-staple food with higher nutritional quality. 
  New varieties introduced from abroad in recent years can be 
seen in today's vegetable stalls. Out-of-season vegetables now 
enrich household meals. 
  He said that the farmers now pay greater attention to 
adjusting their production structure to meet the demands of the 
market. 
  To ensure the smooth carrying out of the project, many large 
and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, 
Guangzhou and Wuhan have taken effective measures. 
  Construction funds and risk funds for vegetable growing have 
been set up to protect farmers. Measures such as keeping 
reserves of important non-staple foods have also been adopted. 
  The Shanghai government will allocate 266 million yuan in 
opening up 3,000 more hectares of vegetable fields this year. 
  The Beijing government plans to invest 67 million yuan in 
opening up 10,000 hectares of new vegetable fields and 
introducing mass production of vegetables in its suburbs. 
  He Jihai, vice-minister of internal trade in charge of 
supplies of non-staple foods, said the state will spare no 
efforts to protect vegetable fields in city suburbs. He 
suggested that vegetable fields should be included in 
comprehensive city construction plans.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 6 June, the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government jointly held a telephone 
conference to implement the guidelines of the national telephone 
conference on investigating and handling major and serious cases 
of economic crime and severely punishing those who have 
committed economic crimes, and to make overall arrangements for 
launching the struggle to severely punish those who have 
committed economic crimes. 
  The telephone conference was presided over by (Ji Jiahong), 
secretary general of the provincial party committee. Fu Xishou, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and Anhui 
governor, and Chen Guanglin, member of the standing committee of 
the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial 
commission for discipline inspection, attended the conference. 
  Yang Yongliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, made an important speech. 
  In his speech, Yang Yongliang pointed out: The provincial 
party committee and the provincial government have always 
considered the investigation and handling of major and serious 
cases and economic crimes and punishing corruption to be an 
important political task. Discipline inspection, supervision, 
and procuratorial organizations at various levels have given 
full play to their roles in the struggle. They have made 
significant achievements in investigating and handling major and 
serious cases and in cracking down on economic crimes. However, 
we must understand that at present the problem of crimes in the 
economic field is still quite serious. Therefore, leading 
comrades of concerned departments at various levels must attach 
great importance to the work of investigating and handling major 
and serious cases of economic crime, firmly correct the thinking 
that cracking down on economic crimes is antagonistic to 
developing a socialist market economy, change the negative and 
perfunctory attitude toward the anticorruption struggle, and 
overcome the fear of difficulty because of obstacles and 
interferences in investigating and handling some cases. We must 
do a solid job of investigating and handling major and serious 
cases and in launching struggles against corruption. 
  Yang Yongliang emphatically pointed out that we must in the 
coming months, especially in the third quarter, launch the 
province-wide struggle to severely punish economic crimes. We 
should stress investigating and handling cases of bribery, 
swindling, and smuggling. We should pay particular attention to 
investigating and handling crimes committed by members of party 
and government leading organs, administrative and judicial 
departments, and economic management departments. Concerned 
departments in various locales must make great efforts to tackle 
key issues and do a good job in the struggle. We must further 
mobilize the masses and encourage them to report cases of 
corruption. We should assign capable people to investigate and 
solve major and serious cases of economic crime. The chief 
procurators should personally handle those cases. We should 
enforce a responsibility system in investigating and handling 
those cases, and each level should check the work of the lower 
level. We should establish a system of supervising the progress 
in investigating and handling major and serious cases. The 
higher level should dispatch work teams to the lower level to 
help solve difficult cases which have encountered interference. 
We must thoroughly investigate and handle cases of economic 
crime. 
  In the next period, various discipline inspection and 
supervision departments as well as administrative and judicial 
departments should promptly transfer cases which have 
constituted crimes to judicial organizations . The economic 
administrative departments should actively assist judicial 
organizations in investigating and handling major and serious 
cases involving their own units. The judicial organizations 
should selected some major and serious cases, hear and prosecute 
those cases as quickly as possible, and impose heavy sentences. 
The judicial organizations at various levels should be 
resolute, prudent, and correct in hearing and adjudicating those 
cases. As for cases involving economic departments, we must 
ensure that normal production and operations will not be 
interrupted while those cases are investigated. In 
investigating and handling major and serious cases, the judicial 
organizations should actively offer suggestions and help 
concerned departments and units close loopholes in light of 
existing problems. 
  Yang Yongliang stressed that party committees and 
governments 
at various levels must help judicial units remove obstacles and 
interference in exercising laws and resolutely correct local and 
departmental protectionism in a few places. We must adopt 
measures to effective guarantee the necessary funds for 
investigating and handling major and serious cases. Committees 
on politics and law at various levels must coordinate the 
leading work of investigating and handling major and serious 
cases and must strengthen their supervision over the work. 
Various judicial units should exercise the law strictly and be 
bold in handling difficult cases. All cases which constitute 
crimes must be thoroughly investigated regardless of which 
department or person is involved. 
  In conclusion, Yang Yongliang asked units concerned at 
various levels to properly integrate the struggle against 
economic crime to ensure that the work of economic construction 
is combined with the current struggle against serious criminal 
cases. He said that it is necessary to truly attach equal 
importance to cracking down on crimes and to promoting economic 
construction. In this way, we can effectively promote the 
anticorruption struggle, maintain social and political 
stability, and ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the economy in this province.

  [Text] Fuzhou, June 9 (CNS) -- In improving its economy, 
Fujian, a resources-hungry province in south China, places its 
hopes on coastal cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou and 
Zhangzhou as well as inland towns of Nanping and Sanming where 
new hi-tech industries are fast developing. 
  --The province last year saw an output value of RMB 
[renminbi] 5.3 billion earned from such an industry by 
enterprises across the province including those in its 
state-level new hi-tech industrial development zones. This 
industry has now become a new driving force for the economic 
development of the province. 
  --Some 49 new hi-tech enterprises operating in the province 
have developed a batch of new products covering electronic 
information, biological engineering, 
optical-machinery-electrical industry and new materials, 
achieving sound economic results. 
  --The new hi-tech industrial development zones in Fuzhou and 
Xiamen have been included in the 52-strong list of state-level 
zones of this kind across the country. The Cangshan Scientific 
and Technological Garden in Fuzhou has seen ten factory 
buildings under construction, and eight enterprises engaging in 
new hi-tech industry have been set up there with annual output 
value expected to be RMB 130 million, the annual output value of 
the Hongshan Scientific and Technological Garden now is put at 
over RMB 300 million while in the Mawei Scientific and 
Technological Garden, a batch of construction items including 
the second-phase construction project for the New World Computer 
Company have been completed. 
  --The Torch Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone in Xiamen 
has 
become a keen site for foreign investment with 31 foreign-funded 
enterprises being approved in the zone. Their total investment 
has reached RMB 260 million and their output value last year was 
RMB 500 million. With the support of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, the China Institute of Science and 
Technology and a shopping mall selling scientific and 
technological products have been established in Xiamen City. 
  --The Quanzhou Hi-Tech Corridor has also seen its business 
developing very fast. The Shishi Hi-Tech Photo Equipment 
Research Institute has developed stereoscopic colour enlargers 
whose quality ranks first in the country. In addition, 
preparations for the construction of the China (Shishi) Garments 
Hi-Tech Development Centre and three province-level hi-tech 
industrial development zones in Zhangzhou, Nanping and Sanming 
are now under way. 
  --The province has planned to cultivate 100 new hi-tech 
enterprises and develop 80 new hi-tech products this year.

  [Text] Fuzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian 
Province is expanding its fourth airport, Jinjiang Airport, 
which is located in Quanzhou Prefecture, and it is expected to 
go into trial service next may. 
  Built in 1954, the airport used to serve the military forces 
only. It was given approval by the central government to become 
a civil airport in July last year. 
  A local official in charge of the project said the expansion 
will require a total investment of 180 million yuan (some 2.1 
million U.S. dollars). 
  Upon completion, the modern airport with an annual handling 
capacity of 650,000 passengers will be able to accommodate large 
and medium-sized planes, and link Quanzhou with Hong Kong, 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai by air.

  [Text] A bulletin on environmental conditions in Fujian 
Province in 1993 issued yesterday by the provincial 
environmental protection bureau shows that during the past year, 
although the growth of our province's GDP was faster than in 
1992, environmental pollution had not deteriorated despite rapid 
economic development and that further ecological damage has been 
basically curbed, or eased. Our environmental protection work 
has been strengthened. 
  However, data in the bulletin shows that current 
environmental protection in our province is still far from 
meeting the demands of economic development. In some 
localities, problems caused by effluent, exhaust fumes, waste 
residues, and noise still spread unchecked. Environmental 
pollution, mainly seen in cities and towns across the province, 
is becoming serious and is spreading very fast. The scope of 
ecological damage has widened and has become more acute. In a 
small number of localities, environmental pollution and 
ecological damage have become factors constraining sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the local economy.

  [Text] At the provincial forum on management of 
transactions of state assets ownership held on Zoucheng on 9 
June, Chen Jianguo, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and vice governor of the province, stressed: We 
should actually strengthen management of transactions of state 
assets ownership, make a conscientious analysis of new 
circumstances and new problems, research and formulate measures 
and methods for ensuring the sound development of transactions 
of state assets ownership and for avoiding the loss of 
state-owned assets, and promote the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system. 
  Chen Jianguo pointed out: The transaction of property rights 
of enterprises is the outcome of the market economy, an 
effective way to achieve optimum distribution and rational flow 
of assets under the condition of the market economy, and a means 
adopted by the government to readjust industrial structure. 
Over the past few years, quite a few localities in the province 
have conducted useful explorations and experiments for 
transactions of property rights of enterprises and have helped 
separate government administration from enterprise management 
and change the operation mechanism of enterprises through the 
methods of absorbing more owners of shares and selling and 
leasing enterprises to others. As a result, the vitality of 
enterprises has been enhanced and some new experiences have been 
created. Some new circumstances and new problems have also 
emerged, however. In particular, the loss of state-owned assets 
has been extremely serious in a few localities and enterprises. 
  Chen Jianguo stressed: The transaction of property rights is 
a work deeply related to policies and professions. In this 
regard, we should not only be positive but also appropriate. In 
guiding the specific work, we should successfully grasp the 
following several points: 
  First, the transactions of property right should 
persistently 
follow the direction of socialism. Second, the transactions of 
property right should aim at safeguarding the property and 
interests of the state. Third, the transactions of property 
rights should be combined with the optimization of industrial 
structure and the optimization of the distribution of resources. 
Fourth, the transactions of property rights should give full 
consideration to the placement of enterprise workers and staff 
and to social stability.

"Applause and Hope"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 8 June, applause rang out 
continuously at the auditorium of Jinan Prison when it was 
announced at the third provincial congress of the 
sentence-serving persons active in undergoing labor reform that 
200 persons who rendered meritorious service would be awarded 
citations for merit, and 72 persons would be released on parole, 
be set free, or have their penalty reduced, the 250 
representatives of sentence-serving persons active in undergoing 
labor reform who were participating in this congress, responded 
to the announcement with prolonged and warm applause. The 
applause was filled with repentance for their past crimes and 
with hope for their future. 
  (Jiang Lusheng), who was awarded a citation for merit at the 
congress, clapped until his hands turned red, and his eyes were 
moist with tears. Having been given a life sentence in 1983 on 
the charge of larceny, today he truly experienced the value of 
turning over a new leaf. When he was sent to jail, he was just 
a graduate of a primary school. Over the past 11 years, at the 
prison's school for training offenders, he assiduously accrued 
knowledge and skills and was even invited to serve as senior 
technician. During production and labor, he accomplished scores 
of innovation achievements one after another, saved hundreds of 
thousands in funds for the state, and created a miracle even 
praised by foreign specialists. Hence, his term of imprisonment 
has changed from life imprisonment to a set term of imprisonment. 
  (Liu Zhengxing), deputy director of the provincial judicial 
department and political commissar of the provincial labor 
reform bureau, said: There are many other activists like (Jiang 
Lusheng). Since 1985, a total of 27,511 offenders in the 
province have extricated themselves from the bounds of 
illiteracy in prison, and 72,761 offenders have obtained the 
certificates of technology of various grades issued by labor 
departments. 
  A prodigal who returns is more precious than gold. As said 
by (Li Fengde), head of the provincial labor reform bureau, some 
of the many offenders who were released after serving the 
sentence have been employed as state cadres and plant directors 
and managers, and some of them have been elected people's 
congress deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference. (Wang Zenglin), former offender at the 
no. 3 provincial prison, has seized 27 law violators and 
criminals after leaving the prison and has become rich through 
hard work, thus being elected as the advanced laborer of the 
state and commended in Beijing. 
  Wang Yuxi, vice governor of the province, said excitedly at 
the congress: In providing employment, the party and the 
government have treated the persons released after serving the 
sentence without discrimination. So long as these persons are 
reformed satisfactorily and are furnished with appropriate 
knowledge and proficient skills, they will be well received by 
society after serving the sentence. On hearing this, the 
audience burst into prolonged and warm applause once more again.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 9 (CNS) -- According to the latest 
statistics, Shanghai, the biggest industrial city in China, has 
to date totally approved 8,551 foreign-funded items with 
contracted foreign investment of U.S.$17.55 billion. 
  Though some foreign businessmen hesitated about their 
investment in the city at the beginning of this year, when the 
city began to implement its new tax system which, they wondered, 
might have an unfavourable influence on their businesses, 
statistics show that foreign investment in the city still grew 
in a steady way with 1,620 foreign-funded items with contracted 
foreign investment of U.S.$3.852 billion were newly approved in 
the first five months of this year, respectively increasing by 
34 percent and 10 percent over the same period last year. 
  Foreign investment in the city this year has three 
characteristics. First, industrial items were still welcomed by 
foreign investors. In May alone, 1,183 foreign-funded 
industrial items were approved, accounting for over 70 percent 
of the total endorsed. 
  Second, the city saw more and more multinational companies 
investing in this municipality. 41 items invested by 27 
companies were approved last month. Up to date, some 136 
multinational companies from various foreign countries and 
regions have been attracted to invest in this metropolis and 
their total investment has been nearly up to U.S.$3 billion [as 
received]. 
  Third, investors from Japan and Singapore grew sharply with 
191 Japan-funded and 67 Singapore-funded items being approved 
between January and May, respective increases of 55 percent and 
100 percent in number over the same period last year.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 9 (XINHUA) -- A late-coming 
high-tech park is rising in Pudong New Area as a driver of 
industrial transformation in this old manufacturing center. 
  The 17-sq-k Zhangjiang Park is aimed at applying new- and 
high- tech research and development to industrial production. 
Education is also its focus. 
  Construction was started in late 1992. The city's first 
high- tech development zone, Caohejing, was initiated six years 
ago. 
  A grand project to compose biomedical industry is under way. 
Now some world leaders in pharmaceuticals have poured money 
into the zone, while local medical universities and research 
institutes are planning to move some operations there. The 
sector will turn out about 7 billion yuan (0.8 billion U.S. 
dollars) in products by the end of this century, one-third of 
the total in medicine production in Shanghai. 
  A "computer software town" is also being built in the park. 
  The Golden Bridge export processing zone in Pudong has 
concentrated on telecommunications and other pollution-free 
industries. Here two out of three projects are in the new and 
high- tech field, while half of the factories are producing for 
export. 
  More than forty large overseas and domestic companies have 
located in the 19-sq-k area, together with a high-tech group 
made up of 33 of China's top universities. 
  In the Waigaoqiao bonded zone, there is already a free flow 
of goods, foreign exchange and personnel abroad. Businesses 
ranging from import and export, to re-export, export processing, 
bonded storage and real estate are in full swing. 
  Four deepwater berths have been completed, capable of 
handling 2.4 million ton of goods a year.

<F P=106> [By Liu Wei (0491 0251): "Tibet Scores Notable Results in </F>
Establishing Lateral Economic Ties With Other Localities of 
China"] 
  [Text] Lhasa, 5 June (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Tibet has scored 
results in establishing lateral economic ties with many 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the 
hinterland. At present, there are 240 wholly owned, joint 
venture, or partnership enterprises in Tibet. In the last eight 
years, contracts on 600 economic coordination projects have been 
signed involving an investment of 700 million yuan. 
  In establishing lateral economic ties with the hinterland, 
Tibet has upheld the principle of combining giving play to 
superior local natural resources with the introduction of new 
techniques. The Lhasa Cement Plant succeeded in raising its 
cement quality to state standards and eliminated its 
long-standing losses by establishing a joint venture with the 
Sichuan Emei Cement Plant, which helped import an advanced 
production line. The Lhasa Farm Machinery Gypsum Plant overcame 
difficulties by introducing new techniques for producing gypsum 
from the Hunan Zhuzhou New Building Materials Factory and the 
Zhengzhou Design Institute. Last year Tibet approved 41 joint 
venture projects ranging from transportation to light industry, 
textiles, commerce, and trade. 
  Tibet has also invested in other localities to make money. 
Since 1991, Tibet has set up 39 productive and operating 
enterprises in 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the 
hinterland involving an investment of 170 million yuan. Out of 
39 projects, 25 are profitable, with annual earnings amounting 
to 46 million yuan, while certain enterprises recovered their 
investment in the same year they made the investment.

  [Text] What is Hebei's current endeavor to build the 
spiritual civilization, and what are its problems and 
priorities? This is a question that Cheng Weigao, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, has paid great attention to. On 
the morning of 7 June, provincial leaders Cheng Weigao, Chen 
Yujie, and Han Licheng heard a report on this issue given by the 
propaganda department of the provincial party committee. 
  After listening to the report, Cheng Weigao spoke on further 
intensifying efforts to build the spiritual civilization. He 
said: The current situation in building the spiritual 
civilization is good on the whole. However, this endeavor has 
yet to be developed in range and quality. We should 
conscientiously probe this in line with the new conditions. We 
should note that it is all the more important to step up efforts 
to build the socialist spiritual civilization when the socialist 
market economy system is being established gradually and money 
worship has become increasingly conspicuous in some localities. 
We should not only build an economically strong province, but 
we should also make Hebei a province with a strong spiritual 
civilization. The emphasis in the endeavors towards a spiritual 
civilization lies in the efforts to build it. Aiming at 
achieving a fairly comfortable life and promoting social 
progress, all localities should do a good job in formulating 
plans for building the spiritual civilization. The plans should 
at least specify the goals, fronts, activities, systems, and 
[words indistinct]. 
  Speaking on the work that should be made successful when 
building the spiritual civilization, Chen Weigao pointed out: 
Focusing on the education on patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism, we should greatly advocate the spirit of courage in 
doing what is right, helping the people in need, helping the 
wounded and the dying, unity and friendship, selfless devotion, 
and hard work in pioneering new causes. We should extensively 
organize and carry out various healthy, cultivated, and 
civilized cultural activities that the masses can participate 
in. We should appraise and name civilized units and civilized 
villages and towns strictly according to established standards. 
We should conduct extensive and in-depth education on the legal 
system, especially among young people, conduct special study on 
the five-and-a-half-day work system and on how to organize and 
guide the masses' sparetime activities, do a better job in the 
infrastructure for cultural activities, and strictly manage the 
cultural market according to law, especially the markets for 
video and audio products and publications and recreational 
areas. We should earnestly solve the problems in the cultural 
market which are reflected in the refusal to abide by laws or 
laxity in enforcing laws. In rural areas, emphasis should be 
placed on the crackdown on feudal and superstitious activities. 
Such activities that endanger the physical and mental health of 
the masses and cause serious consequences should be strictly 
banned. 
  Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
urged party committees and governments at all levels to examine 
and arrange all tasks for building the spiritual civilization in 
a unified manner, conscientiously strengthen leadership, and 
change some localities' unwillingness to spend money on building 
the spiritual civilization. Top leaders of party committees and 
the comrades and departments in charge of the spiritual 
civilization should conscientiously hold their responsibility 
and be competent in their work. 
  Chen Yujie, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, also spoke on his opinions at the report meeting.

  [Text] At the iron-smelting furnace on 22 May, Tangshan 
city public security bureau destroyed over 10,000 illegal 
firearms confiscated from civilians. The broad masses of 
citizens praised the public security organs for doing a good 
thing for social stability. 
  From July last year to the end of March this year, in view 
of 
the serious threat on social stability imposed by the increase 
in the number of cases involving the use of guns, Tangshan 
public security bureau concentrated time and police forces on 
comprehensively working to confiscate all sorts of firearms 
illegally used by civilians. The broad masses of public 
security cadres and policemen went deep to neighborhoods and 
villages to conduct investigations in every household in an 
effort to know the real situation, explained the policies to 
firearms holders, and confiscated 10,541 firearms in nearly one 
year's time. Of these firearms, there were 378 steel-ball guns, 
78 hunting rifles, 1,406 air guns, 4,343 firelocks, 31 
small-caliber rifles, 2,247 tear-gas guns, 1,848 imitation guns

  [Text] From 4 to 7 June, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, conducted investigation and study in 
Yichun city during which he pointed out: The most important 
task facing the cadres and the masses across the province is to 
conscientiously study volume no.3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, further emancipate the mind, and realize the 
change from the planned economy into the socialist market 
economy. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, Wang Xianmin, member of the standing committee of the 
provincial party committee and secretary general, and 
responsible comrades of provincial-level departments concerned 
joined in the inspection tour. 
  Yue Qifeng and his entourage successively traveled to (Lang) 
Township, and (Guyingzi) and (Nanxia) Districts in Tieli city to 
inspect more than 10 state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises, joint-investment enterprises, township enterprises, 
individual, and private enterprises, visited (Ma Yongshun), a 
model worker on the forestry front, and (Chen Tongzhi), an 
outstanding paddy rice grower. In every place they visited, 
leading comrades of the provincial party committee extensively 
contacted with cadres and masses at the grass-roots level, and 
asked in detail about their situations in various aspects, such 
as production, operation, and living. During his inspection, 
Comrade Yue Qifeng gave some important views. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Since the third plenary session of the 11th 
party Central Committee, we have greatly emancipated our minds 
indeed. However, we must never overestimate this point. 
Northeast China is the first region that entered the planned 
economic front but the last one to leave it. At present, it is 
still in a state of retreating from this front. Many 
departments, enterprises, and units have still held fast to the 
planned economic front, and the traditional concepts left over 
by the planned economy still can be seen everywhere. Therefore, 
emancipating the mind has remained our major task at present and 
for some time to come. Only when our minds are emancipated, can 
we further deepen reform, expand opening up, give full play to 
the wisdom and ability of the people, and change the advantages 
of resources into commodity and economic advantages. First of 
all, leading cadres at all levels should emancipate their minds 
and so do the masses of people. It is necessary to act in line 
with the ideology and work realities, combine the emancipation 
of minds with the specific issues in economic construction, and 
grasp them conscientiously and firmly. If we do a good job in 
emancipating the minds, our pace to advance will be rapid and 
even [words indistinct]. 
  Yue Qifeng pointed out: Heilongjiang is an important 
industrial base of the state. For a long time, it has made 
great contributions and sacrifices to the country's socialist 
construction. At present, to readjust the production set-up, it 
is not realistic to rely only on the efforts of the state. We 
must rely on our own efforts. We should regard reform of the 
property right system as a nucleus and expand the enterprise 
reform strength. In the past, enterprises used to clasp 
state-owned enterprises which were considered as the trump 
cards. Actually, this is the sign of a big common bowl. We 
should be determined to conduct reform of the property right 
system in small state-owned industrial and commercial 
enterprises and lease out or sell what should be leased or sold. 
We should not continue to sit at home eating away our resources. 
  Yue Qifeng repeatedly stressed the necessity of grasping 
enterprise management. He said: One of the major reasons for 
enterprise deficits is lax management and discipline, having no 
person to assume responsibility, and thus resulting in low 
economic efficiency. Grasping management needs no investment. 
But, we must [words indistinct]. Therefore, enterprises should 
conduct activities on training internal skills, grasping 
management, tapping potential, and increasing efficiency, raise 
the management level, and enhance economic returns. 
  Yue Qifeng said: While attending to state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises, we should exert efforts to grasp 
township enterprises, high and new technology industries, 
tertiary industry, three types of foreign-funded enterprises, 
neighborhood collective enterprises, and individual and private 
enterprises in an effort to cultivate new economic growing 
points. These new economic points need very little investment 
but have very rapid development rates and can yield economic 
returns within a short time. At present, we should give a free 
hand in the development of individual and private economic 
units. In short, we should develop all types of enterprises and 
actively support those who can be developed rapidly. 
  Yue Qifeng said: I have traveled to the forestry area to 
have 
a look of it and discovered that it is really rich in natural 
resources and has treasures everywhere. It is necessary to 
enhance the concept of market and the sense of commodity, 
protect, cultivate, and develop the natural resources, and 
transform the resources advantages into commodity and economic 
advantages. 
  Yue Qifeng fully affirmed the achievements of (Nanxia) 
District in developing small-scale processing of wood products 
and pointed out: In this processing work, we may develop many 
varieties. This work has great prospects. It is necessary to 
give the people a free hand in running this business and let all 
households do it. The government should do a good job in market 
construction and service. As long as we change our minds, we 
will not lead a poor life when there is a gold mountain nearby. 
  During investigation and study, Yue Qifeng emphatically 
pointed out on several occasions: We should try by all possible 
means to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of cadres. He 
said: When the people are eager to do a thing, they can even 
move Thai Shan and when the people are not happy and not eager 
to do it, nothing can be accomplished. Our cadres should strive 
to make the places where they serve as officials prosperous. 
This is the full expression of ability of political integrity of 
cadres. To evaluate cadres, we must pay attention to the 
achievements in their career and not to any relations. In the 
course of building the socialist market economic system, as long 
as we strengthen party building and mobilize the positive 
factors of all sectors, all difficulties facing us will surely 
be overcome, and the economic invigoration of Heilongjiang will 
surely reappear under the socialist market economic conditions.

  [Text] The China Dialectics of Nature Research Society, 
the Heilongjiang Provincial Scientific and Technological 
Association, the provincial economic and trade society, and the 
provincial Dialectics of Nature Research Society, cosponsored 
the seminar which was held in Harbin today on the present 
situation and prospects for developing economic and trade 
relations with CIS countries. Over 60 specialists and 
representatives from six provinces and cities across the 
province studied the issues on the influence that the political 
and economic situations of CIS countries impose on us, the 
current existing problems in border and local trade, 
countermeasures for this, and prospects for developing 
cooperation with the south and opening up the north, and on the 
basic role they may play. 
  During the seminar, Vice Governor Wang Zhongzhang 
emphatically pointed out: At present, the difficulties which we 
have met in our economic and trade work are temporary. These 
difficulties are not caused naturally. We should unswervingly 
implement the measure proposed by the provincial party committee 
on attaching strategic importance to opening the border areas to 
the outside world, do a good job in readjusting the trade items, 
strengthen economic and technological cooperation, accelerate 
the pace of building our province into an international main 
channel, establish long-term economic and trade relations with 
foreign countries, and promote continued development of foreign 
economic and trade relations in our province. 
  More than 40 academic theses and research reports were 
submitted to the seminar.

  [Excerpts] At the provincial help-the-poor and development 
working meeting, which closed on the afternoon of 5 June, 
provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng urged leading cadres at 
all levels to deepen their understanding, strengthen leadership, 
and fulfill the great task of helping the poor through 
development. 
  During the meeting, in light of local conditions, 
representatives from all parts of the province held earnest 
discussions on how to implement the province's help-the-poor 
plan for this year and eliminate backwardness in the poor areas 
as quickly as possible and offered good suggestions and opinions. 
  Present at the meeting were leading comrades including Yin 
Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Wang Hanmin, Yao Xiangcheng, Huanjie 
Cailang, Mao Yuanbiao, Bai Ma, and Liu Guanghe, and Han Yingxuan 
[provincial CPPCC chairman]. 
  At the meeting, Ying Kesheng put forth concrete measures to 
organize implementation of the province's help-the-poor plan for 
this year and made an important speech on how to do a good job 
of carrying out this year's help-the-poor work. 
  In his speech, Yin Kesheng said: Historic achievements have 
been made in the economies of both our province's rural and 
pastoral areas since the drive of reform and opening up to the 
outside world was carried out. Nevertheless, hamstrung by 
historical, geographical, and other elements, 1.19 million 
peasants in our province still have problems of food and 
clothing. The 1990's are crucial to our province in pursuing 
the goal of the second-step strategy. Paying close attention to 
the work of helping the poor through development is part and 
parcel of the goal. Thus we should understand and approach the 
work from the level of the overall situation of the national 
economy. While encouraging the areas which have relatively good 
conditions to continue to maintain the momentum of rapid 
development, we should help the poor areas speed up the pace of 
their development and construction to boost the province's 
economic strength, promote common prosperity and progress among 
all nationalities, and maintain social stability. He pointed 
out that the work of helping the poor through development is a 
social systems engineering undertaking. We should correctly 
handle the relationship between taking stopgap and radical 
measures and between long-term and immediate interests, be good 
at grasping the principal contradiction, and concentrate forces 
on improving basic conditions for production and enhancing the 
ability of poor areas to develop themselves. [passage omitted] 
  Yin emphasized that implementation of the help-the-poor and 
development plan is a task which has a strong policy, social, 
and mass character. We should attach greater importance to the 
work of helping the poor through development than we did in the 
past. Party committees and governments at all levels should put 
the work on the agenda as an important task. Principal party 
and government leaders should personally take up the job, take 
the overall situation into account, and make overall plans. The 
provincial party committee and government decided to introduce a 
prefectural, city, and county principal administrative leader 
responsibility system in implementing the province's 
help-the-poor plan for this year. [passage omitted] 
  Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao presided over the current meeting 
and set requirements for the transmission and implementation of 
the spirit of the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Wang Bo (3076 3134): "Qinghai Absorbs Capital and </F>
Technology To Exploit Resources"] 
  [Text] Xining, 5 Jun (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Qinghai has 
strengthened its lateral economic ties and economic and 
technological cooperation with other provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions by making adequate use of its superior 
natural resources. By late 1993, Qinghai had signed contracts 
for 1,137 joint venture projects, introducing and using 384 
million yuan from areas outside the province with the total 
realized amount for material coordination standing at 424 
million yuan. A total of eight autonomous prefectures, 
prefectures, and cities in the province have established 
cooperative ties with corresponding units in 61 prefectures, 
cities, and counties outside the province. 
  Since 1988, Qinghai has set up 121 joint venture factories 
and operating companies and 273 joint venture operations and 
service windows [jing ying fu wu chuang kou 4842 3602 2591 0523 
4514 0656] in areas outside the province, with aggregate 
investment hitting 150 million yuan. Enterprises throughout the 
province have introduced over 100 new technologies or new 
achievements in scientific research each year. Nearly 30 
enterprises outside the province have invested 15 million yuan 
in Xinghai, Tongde, and Qilian counties, which are focused on 
tapping natural resources. In the meantime, Qinghai has 
established cooperative economic and technological relations 
with other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions 
throughout the country. Qinghai has signed contracts for 287 
joint venture projects with provinces and autonomous regions 
along the Huang He alone.

<F P=106> ["Special" article by Li Xiaozhun (2621 1321 6150)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 29 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In recent 
years, since the mainland has actively explored overseas markets 
and vigorously improved product quality, while many Taiwan 
businesses are investing in the mainland, the mainland has 
apparently gotten the upper hand on Taiwan in the competition 
for foreign trade, especially for market shares in the United 
States. 
  In 1992, China, with $25.5 billion worth of exports to the 
United States, overtook Taiwan for the first time. In 1993, 
China left Taiwan further behind, with $31.4 billion worth of 
exports to $23.5 billion from Taiwan. China's exports to the 
United States amounted to $7.4 billion for the first quarter 
this year, nearly 40 percent higher than the $5.3 billion worth 
achieved by Taiwan. It is predicted that the competition in 
foreign trade between the two shores will be getting more acute 
since the United States has now renewed the most-favored-nation 
[MFN] status for China. And the mainland, as a traditional 
exporter of labor-intensive products, is expected to gain a 
still greater share of the U.S. market. 
  For years the United States has always been the largest 
market for Taiwan exports. In recent years, however, Taiwan's 
competitive power as a traditional exporter of labor-intensive 
products has been declining because of the increase in 
production costs as a result of labor shortages and wage 
increases. Consequently Taiwan export market share in the 
United States has been decreasing year by year. Taiwan's exports 
to the United States have been continuously declining since 
1987, and Taiwan product market share has decreased from 6.07 
percent in that year down to 4.34 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, 
however, China's share of the U.S. market has been expanding 
from 1.55 to 5.46 percent during the same period. 
  Of the traditional Chinese and Taiwan exports to the United 
States, China-made garments, plastic products, furniture, and 
shoes exported to the United States increased by 22, 59, 44, and 
32 percent respectively in 1993; whereas Taiwan-made garments, 
plastic products, and shoes exported to the United States 
decreased by 7.1, 6.6, and 30.8 percent respectively, only 
furniture exports which registered a slight increase of 1.9 
percent. What is more, China's toy exports to the United States 
has now surpassed by far Taiwan's past record in terms of export 
value. All these changes indicate that Taiwan has lagged behind 
China in terms of competitive power for quite a few export items 
in the U.S. market. 
  The United States recently announced the renewal of the MFN 
status for China Mainland. This will give an impetus to further 
increasing the competitive power of China's exports to the U.S. 
market. And China's exports, especially labor-intensive 
products, will further expand their market share in the United 
States. To meet the increasingly keen competition between the 
two shores of the Taiwan Strait in foreign trade, Taiwan will 
need to step up its efforts to upgrade local industries, further 
readjust the composition of exports to the United States, and 
increase exports with high added value, otherwise it can hardly 
improve its position in the competition with China for share of 
U.S. market.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- No relatives of the 
Taiwan tourists who died in the March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy 
were present when the public trial of three men accused of 
murder opened here today. 
  Relatives of the 24 Taiwanese victims had been told that 
they 
could attend the hearings if they wished, official sources here 
said. 
  The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
(ARATS) invited relatives of the boat fire tragedy to attend the 
public trial, via the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF), on the 2nd, 5th and 8th of this month, the sources said. 
  ARATS said that representatives of SEF, too, are allowed to 
attend the trial in their own names. Seats are actually 
reserved for them. 
  In the afternoon of June 8, ARATS received a formal notice 
from the SEF saying that five relatives of the Taiwan victims 
would attend the trial. But none of them have been present at 
the trial so far. 
  Officials here said that the court will make proper 
arrangements for them if relatives of the victims and 
representatives of SEF want to attend the trial before the court 
reaches its decision.

  [Text] A bronze statue of Taiwan's late leader Chiang 
Kai-shek was removed from a traffic circle in the southern port 
city of Kaohsiung on Tuesday, a sign of the former first 
family's declining influence. The four-meter two-ton statue 
erected in 1971 was the last statue of Chiang on horseback in 
Kaohsiung. Opposition protesters have vandalized the statue on 
several occasions. 
  A spokesman for the Kaohsiung City Government said the 
statue 
was removed to ease off a traffic bottleneck at the circle, but 
he could not say why 180 police officers were mobilized at 3 am 
when the statue was being removed. The Chinese language UNITED 
EVENING NEWS said the statue was quietly removed, and police 
officers were ordered to the spot to avoid unnecessary trouble, 
such as protest. An opposition legislator has said there are 
more than 30,000 statues of Chiang Kai-shek across the island.

  [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Foreign investment in 
Taiwan is up, with approved Overseas Chinese and foreign 
investment reaching US$459 million in the first five months of 
this year, 48 percent more than during a similar period of last 
year, according to statistics released Friday [10 June] by the 
Investment Commission. 
  The commission said approved Overseas Chinese and foreign 
investments in electrical and electronic products totaled 
US$139.67 million during the period, up 32 percent from the same 
time last year. 
  This was followed by an increase in food and beverage 
manufacturing investment which was up 144 percent over last 
year. Approved investments in chemical manufacturing, the 
wholesale and retail sales industry, and the service industry 
were also up, the commission added. 
  Overseas Chinese from the United States made the most 
investments during the period, pouring some US$9.064 million 
into Taiwan. This, however, is down 33 percent from last year. 
Overseas Chinese from Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore followed 
the US in total investment. 
  Most of the foreign investment during the period came from 
Europe, with a total of US$113.71 million, slightly ahead of 
Japan's US$111.97 million.

  [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Approved outbound 
investments hit US$823.4 million in the first five months of 
this year, up 70 percent from the same time last year, the 
Investment Commission said Friday [10 June]. 
  The commission said that the investments were mostly 
targeted 
at Southeast Asian nations, especially Malaysia, Singapore and 
Thailand, showing that the government's "southern strategy" and 
its policy of diversification of overseas markets has borne 
fruit. 
  Investment in Malaysia was up 730 percent from the same time 
last year, while investment in Thailand and Singapore was up 111 
percent and 182 percent respectively. 
  Investment in Indonesia was down 59 percent, the commission 
said. They blamed the decline on anti-Chinese riots there 
earlier this year. 
  Investment in Vietnam also edged downward 0.25 percent, the 
commission added. 
  Investment in overseas financial and insurance industries 
was 
up 273 percent to US$379.72 million during the period to top the 
list of investment targets. Investment in the wholesale and 
retail sales industry jumped 778 percent from last year, 
electrical and electronic products investment was up 171 percent 
and investment in the transportation industry was up 479 percent 
from last year, the commission said.

  [Text] Paris, June 10 (CNA) -- French Engineering 
conglomerate the Bouygues Group is interested in tapping the 
Taiwan and Asian markets through cooperation with Taiwan 
counterparts, a firm spokesman said Thursday [9 June]. 
  Michel Derbesse, managing director of Bouygues' Construction 
Engineering Department, said in an interview that his company is 
seeking appropriate partners in Asia to explore the dynamic 
Asian regional [words indistinct]. 
  Bouygues, [words indistinct] leader in infrastructure 
engineering technology, boasted an annual business turnover of 
US$14 billion last year. The company recently completed 
construction of the Channel Tunnel linking France and Britain 
using its self- developed plate drilling machines. 
  The French engineering giant entered the Asian market a few 
years ago. Its recent achievements in the area include a 
colossal open- air all-purpose stadium in Hong Kong, and a new 
city in Thailand which is regarded as an engineering marvel. 
  Bouygues is also a veteran builder of nuclear power plants. 
Commenting on the recent controversy over the proposed fourth 
nuclear power plant in Taiwan, Derbesse said France had also 
experienced similar problems. Opposition, however, died away 
gradually as the people were convinced of the safety of the 
plants. 
  Derbesse said Bouygues volunteered its technical assistance 
to the Chernobyl nuclear plant after the plant exploded in 1986. 
  Michel Demarre, manager of the company's Asian operations, 
said that Taiwan can serve as a springboard to other markets in 
the Asia- Pacific region. Demarre added that he hopes Bouygues 
can begin business in Taiwan by working on projects related to 
the Six-Year National Development Plan. 
  Demarre said Bouygues is ready to offer its services in 
freeway, bridge, tunnel and seaport development, and in other 
fields including oil drilling on seabeds, water treatment, 
telecommunications, industrial pollution prevention, foodstuff 
processing, and motion picture and television film production.

  [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Taiwan's information and 
electronics industries saw a major turnaround last year, 
contributing much to the growth of the manufacturing sector, 
according to a survey by COMMONWEALTH magazine. 
  The information and electronics industries were hard hit by 
a 
worldwide economic recession in 1992, and many companies in the 
fields went bankrupt. 
  However, the two industries rebounded strongly last year, 
with the information industry registering an average profit rate 
of 4.9 percent and electronics makers achieving an even more 
impressive 8.3 percent profit rate, the Chinese-language 
business magazine said in its June issue. 
  The average profit rates for the information and electronics 
industries were 1.4 percent and 3.9 percent respectively in 1992. 
  The magazine said aggregate business turnover of Taiwan's 
top 
1,000 manufacturing companies totaled NT$3 trillion (us$111.11 
billion) in 1993, up 11 percent from the year-earlier level. 
About 54 percent of the increased turnover came from the 
information and electronics industries, the magazine added. 
  A total of 257 information and electronics firms made the 
"COMMONWEALTH top 1,000" list. 
  The magazine said the top 1,000 firms' business turnover 
accounted for 65 percent of the manufacturing industry's total 
production for 1993, compared with 51 percent recorded in 1987. 
  The figures show large enterprises have gradually become the 
mainstay of Taiwan's manufacturing industry following an exodus 
of small and medium sized companies in recent years, the 
magazine noted. 
  It added that although cumulative turnover of the top 1,000 
firms rose only 11 percent in 1993, their net profits increased 
by an average of 30 percent, indicating their efforts to 
streamline management and control operational costs have paid 
off. 
  The commonwealth survey also found non-metal furniture and 
wooden product manufacturers saw 69 percent growth in their 
business turnover last year, the highest among the 24 industries 
under study. On the other hand, chemical, paper and automaking 
industries suffered turnover declines.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (CNS) -- The two-day session held 
by the economic group of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) 
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ended here 
today. Leaders of the group, Mr. Gao Shangquan and Mrs. Nellie 
Fong said in a press conference that today's meeting centered on 
the work report for the first half of this year and had made 
preparations for a concluding meeting to be held in July. The 
session also discussed work set for the second half of the year. 
  Members of the group were convinced that the group would be 
divided into six smaller teams in the second half of the year in 
a bid to smooth the work. The sub-groups are the large-scale 
project and contract study team, the study team for coordination 
of large basic construction in Hong Kong and China, the land and 
housing policy study team, the financial and economic study 
team, the foreign economic relations study team, and the study 
team for economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and 
China after 1997. 
  Mr. Gao said that the latter two teams were newly created in 
a bid to validate agreements and treaties signed by the 
territory with foreign countries before 1997. As economic 
relations increasingly grow closer and bigger between Hong Kong 
and China, a clear picture should be defined for further 
development of such links. Establishment of the two teams can 
help achieve this end and are aimed at maintaining stability 
during the transition period and for the long-term prosperity in 
the territory after 1997.

  [Text] Macao, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China and Portugal 
continued here today their discussions on the involvement of the 
Bank of China (BOC) in note-issuing matters in Macao. 
  Representatives and monetary experts from both sides agreed 
that BOC and Portugal-funded Banco Nacional Ultramarino E.P., 
now the note-issuing bank in Macao, could issue notes in Macao 
at a certain ratio. Concrete measures will be discussed at 
later meetings of the working group. 
  Han Zhaokang, representative from the Chinese team of the 
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, said after the fourth 
meeting here today that talks on the note-issuing would soon 
enter the essential stage. He added, the Chinese Government 
hopes that matters concerning note-issuing should be handled in 
the light of the regulations in the Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Declaration and in the convergence with the Macao Basic Law. 
  Han Zhaokang said he was convinced that when the work on 
note-issuing ends, "it will be a good thing for the maintenance 
of stability of Macao's monetary system."

  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Britain 
already has filed a lawsuit at the EU Trade Court, calling for 
lifting the sanctions involving the imposition of quotas on toys 
from China. 
  An official of the British Ministry of Trade and Industry 
said in Hong Kong: Many British toy importers have suffered 
losses since the EU ministerial meeting in last February decided 
to impose import quotas on China's toy products, and some of 
them have come close to bankruptcy. Similar situations also 
have arisen in other European countries. 
  The "European Toy Manufacturers' Association" pointed out: 
The EU quota imposed on toys from China already has limited the 
amount of this kind of imports to 1.8 billion ECUs this year, 
which is merely half of the originally expected import volume. 
This will drive at least 500 people in the European region out 
of employment, whereas many European toy manufacturers importing 
finished toy products and spares from China will be hit by a 
drop in profits and sales. 
  According to the British Ministry of Trade and Industry, 
this 
kind of all-round import quota restriction, which encompasses 
the whole European region, is really unnecessary since it is 
Spain alone that has opposed the import of toys from China and 
has sought protection for its own toy industry. 
  At present, with the exception of Britain, some other 
European countries also have pointed out that these sanctions 
are unjustifiable. These European countries, which are 
suffering losses, already have started working through legal 
channels to urge the EU to change its decision and lift the 
sanctions.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (AFP)--China's paramount leader 
Deng Xiaoping, who turns 90 in August, is "in good health," a 
foreign ministry spokesman said Friday. 
  Rumors running through the Hong Kong stock market Friday 
said 
the patriarch had died or was critically ill, sparking a 
2.37-percent drop in stock prices on strong selling in the 
morning session to 8,972.59 points -- its lowest level in a 
month. 
  The market recovered to a provisional 9,108.61 points at the 
close of trading Friday. 
  Deng has not been seen in public since February when he was 
shown on television during the Chinese New Year accompanied by 
two of his daughters. Since then, rumors about his health have 
persisted and are consistently denied by the government and his 
entourage. 
  On Wednesday, his daughter Deng Rong said her father "is not 
suffering any illness and is in good health."

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Wei Jianxing, a senior 
leader of the Chinese Communist Party, said today that the 
current anti-corruption campaign will concentrate on major 
economic offences involving leading officials at and above the 
county magistrate level. 
  Addressing a national telephonic conference, Wei, secretary 
of the party Central Discipline Inspection Commission, also 
emphasized the need to halt all kinds of malpractices and 
corruption adversely affecting the progress of reforms, economic 
growth and stability. 
  According to the commission, 15,216 party and government 
officials were disciplined for economic offences during the 
first quarter of 1994. 
  These officials included 450 at county magistrate level, 35 
at the prefectural commissioner's level and three at provincial 
or ministerial level. 
  Of the 15,216 officials, 1,416 were handed over to judicial 
departments for prosecution on criminal charges. 
  Wei Jianxing, a member of the Political Bureau of the party 
Central Committee, said that the current anti-corruption 
campaign should focus on major cases involving economic 
offences, such as embezzlement, bribery, financial frauds and 
violation of financial discipline. 
  "Leading departments of the party and government, judicial 
departments, administrative law-enforcement departments and 
economic administrative departments remain the main targets," he 
said. 
  As part of the anti-corruption campaign, he said, it was 
imperative to halt the malpractices of collecting illicit fees, 
making government-funded sight-seeing tours overseas and making 
improper personal material gains by abusing one's power.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- China conducted an 
underground nuclear test earlier today, a Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here. 
  "China always stands for complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons and, within this context, the 
realization of a comprehensive nuclear test ban," the spokesman 
said. 
  Proceeding from this fundamental position, China has all 
along exercised great restraint in conducting nuclear tests and 
the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely 
limited, he said. 
  China fully respects and understands the position and 
concern 
of many non-nuclear weapon states on the question of nuclear 
testing, he said. 
  Right now, the spokesman said, China is actively 
participating in negotiations on a "comprehensive nuclear test 
ban treaty", and supports the conclusion of such a treaty no 
later than 1996 after negotiations. 
  He said the treaty should be a step towards the complete 
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  "We call on other nuclear weapon states to give up their 
policy of nuclear deterrence and commit themselves in explicit 
terms to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of 
nuclear weapons," he said. 
  "We are ready to make continued unremitting efforts with the 
international community for an early realization of this 
ultimate goal," the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Tai (3769 1132): "Eternal Feelings, </F>
Profound Concern--Record of Wan Li's Conversation with Yan 
Hongchang, a Peasant From Xiaogang"] 
  [Text] Time: The morning of 9 May 1994 
  Venue: Fengzeyuan, Zhongnanhai 
  Comrade Yan Hongchang, chairman of the board of directors 
and 
general manager of the Xiaogang General Agriculture, Industry, 
and Commerce Business Company of Fangyang County, Anhui Province 
(former deputy leader of the Xiaogang production team who took 
the lead in making comprehensive production contracts) and 
Comrade Song Fuhao, deputy general manager of the company, 
accompanied by Comrade Zhang Guangyou (former chief editor of 
NONGMIN RIBAO), visited Comrade Wan Li. 
  While Comrade Wan Li was happily shaking hands with them, 
Comrade Zhang Guangyou asked Comrade Wan Li: "Do you still 
remember him? This (pointing at Yan Hongchang) is Yan 
Hongchang, former deputy leader of the Xiaogang production team 
who took the lead in making comprehensive production contracts 
on a household basis in the past." 
  [Wan] Be seated, be seated! 
  [Yan] All the peasants in Xiaogang miss you. They have 
asked me to pay you a visit! You supported us in making 
production contracts on a household basis. At present, we all 
have enough to eat and are having a comfortable life. We thank 
you from the bottom of our hearts and we all long to see you 
again! 
  (On the afternoon of a certain day in the first lunar month 
of 1979, 15 years ago, Yan Hongchang and others held a meeting 
with 18 peasant households of the Xiaogang production team and 
adopted three "rules" including making comprehensive production 
contracts on a household basis. The Xiaogang production team 
and Fengyang County, in which the production team was located, 
took the lead in rural reform in China. Comrade Wan Li was 
secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee in January 1980. 
On hearing what had happened, he was deeply moved by the 
peasants of Xiaogang. He immediately went to Xiaogang to carry 
out an inspection. He made enquiries from door to door and 
affirmed the practice of the Xiaogang production team. He said: 
"I agree with what you have done. The Prefectural CPC 
Committee has given approval for you to have production 
contracts for three years, and I will give approval for you to 
have production contracts for five years. As long as you can 
make greater contributions to the country, retain more funds for 
the collectives, and improve the living standard of the commune 
members, you will not be regarded as `turning the clock back' 
even if you continue with you contracts all your life.") 
  [Zhang] When I went to Xiaogang the year before last, the 
peasants there asked me to take an old hen to you. I told them 
it was not necessary because you could easily get one. Besides, 
it was inconvenient to carry it. 
  [Wan] How is the life of the people in Xiaogang? 
  [Yan] Not bad. Much better than the days you visited them. 
They all have enough to eat. 
  [Wan] Do they all eat flour and rice? 
  [Yan] They can afford rice and flour now. 
  [Wan] Can they afford meat? 
  [Yan] They can buy it whenever they want to. 
  [Wan] How about clothing? 
  [Yan] They have enough to wear and are wearing better 
clothes. 
  [Wan] How about their living conditions? Have they all 
moved into new houses? How many thatched cottages remain? 
  [Yan] Eighty percent of the people are living in brick 
houses, but there are still a small number of thatched cottages. 
  [Wan] What is the per-capita income? 
  [Yan] The per-capita income was over 800 yuan last year. 
  [Wan] That is still much too little! It would be okay to 
have 2,000 yuan. In addition to food and clothing, they should 
at least have a purchasing power of 1,000 yuan. Without such a 
purchasing power, it is impossible for the market to flourish. 
Foreigners say China is a vast market. China's population 
mainly consists of peasants. How can this market be vast if the 
peasants' purchasing power is poor? We cannot depend on cities 
alone. Therefore, I hope you all will become rich and hope all 
peasants of the country will become rich, live a comfortable 
life, and have much more income. 
  Do they all have television sets now? 
  [Yan] Yes, they do. 
  [Wan] Color ones? 
  [Yan] All except those of two households are black and white 
television sets. 
  [Wan] Too few. What is the per capita amount of land for 
the team? 
  [Yan] Over three mu. 
  [Wan] That means that net income per mu is only 200 yuan 
strong. They cannot become rich by relying on farming alone. 
  [Zhang] At present, the income from growing grain is too 
little. The cost of growing grain is high, but the price of 
grain is low. In some localities, the income from growing a mu 
of grain is not so much as the price of one jin of crabs. The 
price of one jin of crabs on the market is 150 yuan and that of 
a soft-shelled turtle is also 150 yuan. It is impossible to 
become rich by relying on farming alone ... . 
  [Wan] Only if an able-body peasant can grow 50 mu of 
grain will it be possible for his income to exceed 10,000 yuan. 
It is impossible for an able-body person growing eight to ten 
mu of grain to become rich. How many illiterate people are 
there in the production team? 
  [Yan] All children go to school. Quite a lot of grown-ups 
are illiterate, about 50 percent. Almost all people over 40 are 
illiterate. 
  [Wan] You must pay attention to training qualified 
personnel. Only by properly grasping education can there be an 
outlet. The issue of qualified personnel is very important. 
You must attach importance to education and to the training of 
qualified personnel. In the final analysis, whether or not 
production can develop and whether or not the economy can grow 
are determined by the quality of the people. 
  You can establish ties with Shanghai and other developed 
areas and send people to work there on contracts that last two 
to three years in an organized manner. In this way, you can 
earn money and learn technology at the same time and you can 
train qualified personnel. 
  Have you set up some companies? What business do they do? 
  [Song] We have just started. Our foundation is poor and we 
have little to start with. We can only undertake some small 
projects first. 
  [Wan] You cannot earn much this way. Is the burden in your 
place heavy? 
  [Yan] We use minibuses to transport passengers and can earn 
more than 20,000 yuan a year. This can offset the amount to be 
handed over to the state by all the people of the village. 
Therefore, we do not find our burden heavy. 
  [Wan] What about that of the peasants in other villages? 
  [Yan] The burden of those without income other than farming 
is heavy. 
  [Wan] What is the annual output value of township and town 
enterprises of Fengyang County? Has it reached 500 million 
yuan? You may not know. 
  [Zhang] No, we do not. Fengyang County had a poor 
foundation to start with and does not have many channels for 
developing industry. The county does not have products that 
sell extremely well. Nor does it have industries which can 
promote the development of other industries. 
  [Wan] "Without agriculture, we cannot have stability and 
without industry, we cannot become rich!" We must develop 
industry and properly run township and town enterprises. 
Dingyuan, Fengyang, and Jiashan were all poor counties in the 
past. How are they at present? 
  [Zhang] Dingyuan has a salt mine and Jiashan has a brewery. 
Both are large projects. Fengyang has rich quartz deposits. You 
mentioned it several times when I accompanied you there in the 
past, but nothing has yet been achieved. 
  [Wan] Fengyang originally had a spectacles plant, isn't that 
so? How is it at present? I read from NONGMIN RIBAO that there 
is a county in Henan which has quickly become rich by breeding 
loaches. There are indeed many ways to become rich. Provide the 
peasants with more information. You must look for ways to 
become rich on your own initiative. 
  I favor taking the proper way to develop the economy. You 
should carry out good projects. You can have a comfortable life 
once the economy is developed. [Yan] The people of Fengyang 
and Xiaogang miss you and hope you will visit Fengyang again. 
Come to have a look at Xiaogang. Great changes have taken 
place. 
  [Wan] Well, well. I will go once you have properly 
fulfilled your tasks. 
  [Yan] The county government has set up a small decorated 
archway at the entry to Xiaogang Village and hopes you will 
write an inscription for it. 
  [Wan] No, I will not! I do not favor formalism. I will not 
support flourishes, building temples or tombs, or other similar 
things. You should earnestly do a good job in production. 
  [Song] We understand. When we go back, we will properly 
carry out our work and we shall make reports to you again after 
we have made achievements. 
  [Wan] No need to report to me. Seize the time and work 
earnestly. 
  [Yan] Revered Wan, can we have a photo taken as a memento? 
  [Wan] Well, all right. (Comrade Wan Li straightened out his 
clothes and had two photos taken together with three of them.) 
  Finally, Comrade Wan Li shook hands with Yan Hongchang and 
the others and bid them farewell. He saw them off outside the 
door and waved to them.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter: "General Measures for </F>
Macroeconomic Regulation and Control in 1994 Put Forward by the 
Project Team for the Analysis and Forecasting of Economic 
Situation Under the Institute of Quantitative and Technical 
Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences"] 
  [Text] The rapid development of the economy and the 
successive introduction of various reform measures have 
attracted people's enthusiastic attention, as never before, to 
the orientation, force, and actual effects of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control policy. The appearance of this pleasing 
phenomenon not only demonstrates a deepening of people's 
understanding of the connotation of establishing a socialist 
market economy structure, but also reflects people's strong 
demand for a healthy, sustained, and rapid development strategy 
for the national economy, having suffered several economic 
fluctuations. Recently, the experts and scholars of the project 
team of the Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics of 
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' which is devoted to 
analyzing and forecasting the economic situation, (hereafter 
referred to as the Project Team) have studied this issue. Their 
principal viewpoints are excerpted in the following. 
  Considering that the 1994 economic growth rate remains 
at a rather high level, the general measure of macroeconomic 
regulation and control should be the policy of a "soft landing." 
  The Project Team believes that the policy of appropriate 
retrenchment, which was implemented in June and July of 1993, 
has obtained a certain effect. It will cause the 1994 economic 
growth rate to fall back somewhat. However, currently the 
investment growth rate, currency growth rate, etc., are still 
too high, and the balances of financial income and expenditures 
and of foreign trade, and so on, have not fundamentally 
improved. Therefore the 1994 economic growth rate will still 
remain at a relatively high level. Reasons for this are: 
  1. Investment will remain fairly large-scale. Large numbers 
of newly started projects of the past two years need to 
continue, so that the scale of projects under construction is 
rather large, while at the same time, some new important 
projects are waiting to be launched. The adjustment and 
optimization of the industrial structure, and the intensified 
construction of infrastructure and basic industries still 
require the input of large amounts of funds. People's savings 
deposits continue to increase in large quantities, and the 
banking system -- after consolidation -- also has a fair 
concentration of capital. This has provided investment with 
domestic sources of funding. The investment of foreign 
businesses is now at a second peak. The first peak was between 
1985 and 1988, during which the growth rate of foreign capital 
used was 30-48 percent of the fixed-asset investment growth of 
society as a whole. Beginning in 1992, the second peak of 
foreign investment occurred. The growth rate achieved by foreign 
capital reached 44.5 percent. Currently, economic revival in the 
world's major industrial countries is weak, and large quantities 
of capital are looking for new locations to invest. The social, 
political, and economic situation in China looks good and offers 
advantageous conditions to attract foreign capital. In this 
foreign investment peak, foreign investment is not limited to 
the coastal regions only, but has penetrated to the interior. 
It has not been restricted to processing industries, but has 
expanded to infrastructure and basic industries. 
  2. The people's consumption demands will increase steadily. 
In the last two years, the people's income level has seen a new 
rise, the consumption structure also is attaining new heights, 
and the need for choices in shopping has strengthened further. 
These are intensifying and rejuvenating competition in the 
consumer goods market, which was sluggish a few years ago when 
economic growth was at a low point. The increase in people's 
consumption will promote growth in industries and tertiary 
industries. 
  3. Beginning in the latter half of 1993, the contradiction 
between supply and demand in transportation, energy, and certain 
major raw materials was somewhat alleviated. In 1994, viewed 
from the perspective of the production capacity and 
import-export adjustment of these bottleneck departments, a GNP 
growth rate of around 10 percent likely will be sustained. 
  4. If a certain speed of growth is maintained so that the 
economic growth rate falls back smoothly, a large drop between 
two years can be avoided. This is beneficial for ironing out 
economic fluctuations and can prevent major chain reactions and 
shocks between various links of social reproduction as a result 
of excessive slide. 
  Based on these analyses, the general measure of 
macroeconomic 
regulation and control in 1994 should be one of "soft landing," 
that is to say, an appropriate retrenchment policy -- neither 
forceful expansion, nor total retrenchment. One must be very 
cautious of the weight of macroeconomic regulation and control. 
The major economic indicators of macroeconomic regulation and 
control should be set as follows: The GNP growth rate should be 
controlled at around 10 percent and the industrial output value 
growth rate at around 16 percent. Fixed-asset investment of 
society as a whole should be set at around 1.36-1.4 trillion 
yuan, with a 20 percent nominal increase over 1993. Deducting 
the price-rise factor, the actual increase should be at around 
12 percent, which is slightly higher than the GNP growth rate, 
but slightly lower than the industrial growth rate. Newly 
increased loans should be set at around 550 billion yuan, an 
increase of around 20 percent over 1993. New increases in 
issuing currency should be set at around 100 billion yuan, with 
an increase of 17 percent over 1993. 
  Given the soft restraints of structure and the hard 
restraints of bottlenecks, it is a fundamental measure of 
long-term significance to change the structure, readjust the 
industrial structure, and strengthen bottleneck 
departments. Since reform and opening to the outside world, 
compared with before, China's economic fluctuations have seen 
profound changes in certain respects, while in other respects, 
no fundamental changes have occurred. The Project Team believes 
that the changes that have occurred include: 
  In terms of the nature of the fluctuations, the past 
domination of a classical fluctuation has changed to the 
domination of a growth-type fluctuation. The so-called 
classical fluctuation implies that in a period of economic 
contraction, major economic indicators such as the GNP, national 
income, or gross industrial output value, all demonstrate a drop 
in absolute volume, i.e., negative growth. The so-called 
growth-type fluctuation implies that in a period of economic 
contraction, major economic indicators do not demonstrate a drop 
in absolute volume, but show a slowdown in growth rate. This 
change in the nature of economic fluctuations indicates that 
China's economic development has acquired a stronger power for 
growth and for combating decline. The scale of the fluctuations 
obviously has been reduced. This indicates that China's 
economic development has gained a certain degree of stability. 
It also indicates that the government has made great progress 
in deciding the direction and force of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. In terms of the generating mechanism for 
industrial fluctuation, the role played by state-owned industry 
already has been reduced, while the role played by 
non-state-owned industries grows stronger day by day. In 
industrial fluctuation, non-state-owned industries already have 
become the leading wave. In terms of the generating mechanism 
for investment fluctuation, with the diversification of 
investors, investments from independently raised funds and from 
bank loans already have become the leading wave in investment 
fluctuation. In terms of transmitting information on the 
fluctuations, price signals have began to play a role. 
  In the following two important aspects, however, no 
fundamental changes have occurred. One is the soft restraints 
of the structure. Viewed from China's economic fluctuations in 
the past, the source of the investment scale inflating out of 
line with the country's capacity lies in the traditional planned 
economic system, which lacks responsibility and control 
mechanisms. The problems created by the high-speed economic 
growth rate in the first half of 1992 are rooted in the delayed 
reform of the investment, banking, and fiscal and tax systems, 
and the delayed reform of state-owned enterprises. That is to 
say, the "chaos" in the economic order caused by structural 
factors is the root of economic "overheating." Therefore, the 
basic solution is to accelerate both reform and the pace of 
building a socialist market economy structure. The Project Team 
believes that whether or not the "soft landing" of 1994 can 
succeed, and whether or not the economy can grow steadily will 
be an objective test of whether these reforms are successful. 
  The second aspect is the hard restraints of bottleneck 
departments. Viewed from China's economic fluctuations in the 
past -- apart from political, structural, and policy factors -- 
as far as the material factors are concerned, most economic 
expansions eventually have had to slow down because of the hard 
restraints of such bottleneck departments as agriculture, 
transportation, energy, and important raw materials. Therefore, 
an important step to iron out economic fluctuations, raise the 
efficiency of the entire national economy, and guarantee the 
sustained and steady growth of the economy is to make great 
efforts to readjust the industrial structure and to 
fundamentally break through the hard restraints of these 
bottleneck departments. 
  The Project Team points out that in light of historical 
lessons, what is worth mentioning is that one must not 
misunderstand this alleviation of problems as success in 
adjusting the industrial structure, or that bottleneck 
restraints no longer exist. There are two types of adjustment 
of industrial structure: one is adaptive adjustment with only 
short-term significance, i.e., after the high-speed expansion of 
the economy, the proportionate relations among various 
departments are temporarily balanced on a lower demand level by 
suppressing demand. When the next round of high-speed expansion 
takes place, this balance is quickly broken again. The other 
type of industrial structural adjustment is a fundamental 
adjustment with long-term significance, i.e., to persistently 
strengthen the construction of bottleneck departments and 
fundamentally break through the restraints of bottlenecks, hence 
pushing forward the growth of the entire national economy. 
  The various cost pushes generated by price adjustments 
and price deregulation during the transition to a market economy 
still objectively play a considerable role in commodity price 
increases. Thus, controlling both investment expansion and the 
over-issuing of currency becomes a crucial link. 
  To forecast price trends during 1994, one first must analyze 
the major causes of price increases during 1993, and then see if 
these causes are still operating in 1994, and to what degree. 
There were four major reasons for price increases in 1993: The 
first was a long-term deep-level cause, namely, the transition 
from the original planned economy to a market economy, which 
inevitably brings price increases. The second is the direct 
influence of price adjustments and deregulation. The third is 
the demand-push by investment expansion and the over-issuing of 
currency. The fourth is the chaos in economic order, especially 
the influence of the chaotic banking order on price increases. 
  In 1994, the fourth cause mentioned above is being resolved. 
The first and second causes, namely, the various cost-pushes 
generated by price adjustments and deregulation in the 
transition to a market economy, will still objectively play a 
considerable role in pushing prices up. The remaining, third 
cause, namely, the demand-push of investment expansion and the 
over-issuance of currency thus has become a crucial link. This 
is where we will see the effect of macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1994. If, in exercising macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1994, we can appropriately curb investment expansion 
and the over-issuance of currency so that the economic growth 
rate can be brought down a little, then the scale of price 
increases may be reduced somewhat. On the other hand, if the 
growth rate of investment and currency, and of the whole 
economy, bounce back too early and too high, then the scale of 
price increases will increase even further on the basis of the 
first and second causes.

  [Text] Xu Penghang, vice minister in charge of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission [SETC], and his party inspected 
Anhui recently and investigated and studied conditions of 
technical transformation projects there. In a discussion 
meeting called by the provincial government yesterday, Vice 
Governor Wang Xiuzhi reported to comrades in charge of the SETC 
on current conditions of technical transformation exercise in 
Anhui, and strategies adopted by the provincial party committee 
and government for its success. Wang Xiuzhi said: In attaching 
great importance to enterprises' technical transformation, the 
provincial party committee and government have adopted the 
strategy of "one mainstay and two wings" -- taking 
infrastructure as the mainstay and town and village enterprises 
and technical transformation as the two wings -- with emphasis 
on strengthening the former and expanding the latter to ensure 
an economic takeoff in Anhui. It has been proposed in the 
Knowing Well Your Responsibility Certificates signed between the 
provincial government and departments and bureaus in charge that 
over 20 billion yuan will be invested in technical 
transformation projects within three years, during which about 
200 high-tech, fast-running projects will be completed, so that 
output value of technical transformation will contribute not 
less than 30 percent to the total industrial output value. Wang 
Xiuzhi said: With a completed investment of 6.26 billion yuan 
in technical transformation projects in 1993, Anhui has 
succeeded in improving its enterprises' technical, equipment 
level and thus consolidating the strengthening of its economic 
strength. 
  Speaking at the meeting, SETC Vice Minister Xu Penghang 
pointed out: Thanks to conscientious implementation of technical 
transformation projects, Anhui has entered a relatively high 
economic growth period. This strategy should be strengthened in 
the future by well preparing all technical transformation 
projects before their implementation and by laying emphasis on 
speed -- speed in examining and approving well identified 
projects, in commencing production, in entering the market, in 
making money, and in repaying debts. The state will lend its 
strong support to provinces excelling in helping enterprises 
with good performance. 
  Xu Penghang and his party successively inspected some 
enterprises in Suzhou and Hefei City, as well as high and new 
technology industrial development zones. Provincial Governor Fu 
Xishou called on Xu Penghang and his party on the evening of 6 
June. 
  Persons in charge of relevant departments, including the 
provincial discipline inspection commission, the provincial 
economic and trade commission, the Commercial and Industrial 
Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank, and Customs, 
attended yesterday's discussion meeting.

  [Text] Listeners, the 25,000-character report on government 
work that Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the autonomous regional 
people's government, delivered on 15 May to the Second Session 
of the Sixth Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Congress is 
divided into three parts. The station will air excerpts of it 
in several installments. We welcome you to tune in. 
  In the first part of his government work report reviewing 
the 
work in 1993, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu spoke of the steady 
economic progress in rural and pastoral regions. Government at 
all levels increased inputs in farming and stock breeding in 
terms of funds, materials, and technology. As a result, the 
region saw its sixth consecutive good year of agricultural 
production. The total grain output was 620,000 metric tons, up 
3.3 percent over the previous year. In spite of natural 
disasters in some prefectures and counties, all the major stock 
farming indexes rose slightly and remained stable compared to 
the previous year. Relatively rapid progress was made in the 
development of village and township enterprises and diversified 
undertakings. The total output of village and township 
enterprises topped 100 million yuan, an increase of close to 15 
percent compared to the previous year. Income from diversified 
undertakings stood at 240 million yuan, up 18.8 percent from the 
previous year. 
  The report points out: The region's agricultural output in 
1993 topped 2.3 billion yuan, and its total industrial output 
reached 535 million yuan, up 5.3 and 9.4 percent, respectively, 
over the previous year in terms of comparable prices.

  [Text] On 8 June, together with responsible comrades of the 
provincial agricultural, power industrial, and pricing units as 
well as responsible comrades of some cities and counties, 
including Gaocheng, Xianxian, and Lincheng, Leaders Cheng 
Weigao, Li Bingliang, and Gu Erxiong studied and explored the 
situation where the province reduced the peasants' burdens and 
solved the problems relating to the rural areas' electricity 
charges in the past years as well as some existing problems. 
They also exchanged views on the measures that should be 
adopted this summer when planting, harvesting, and field 
management are underway. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: According to the relevant state 
regulations, we should give to the peasants all the interests 
that should be given to them. None is allowed to violate 
regulations to add burdens on the peasants. There must be no 
increase in added burdens, even 1 yuan. Due to the scissors 
movement of the prices for farm and sideline products, the 
comparative efficiency of agriculture has been reduced over the 
past years. Along with the decreases in the output of the 
province's cotton and oil-bearing crops, the peasants' real 
income has become stagnant, and that in some localities has even 
been reduced. It is a foregone conclusion that the province 
will have a summer grain harvest this year. Thus, the peasants 
engaged in summer grain production will possibly register a 
bigger increase in their income. The problem at present is that 
we must not think of adding burdens on the peasants when the 
agricultural situation is better, and the peasants' income 
increases slightly. At present, we must realistically adopt 
measures and concentrate energy on grasping the planting, 
harvesting, and field management in the rural areas. According 
to the state regulations, the grain departments should do a good 
job in purchasing summer grain. Those who violate regulations 
to reduce [words indistinct] and prices and to damage the 
peasants' interests should strictly be punished. We should not 
only ensure to give to the peasants the interests that should be 
given to them according to the state regulations but also 
strictly prevent the occurrence of a rise in the peasants' 
burdens after a fall so as to mobilize their enthusiasm and to 
ensure a sustained, faster, and smooth development of 
agriculture and the national economy. 
  In regard to the issue of ensuring the supply of electricity 
for the rural areas' three summer jobs and the issue concerning 
electricity charges, Cheng Weigao pointed out: The provincial 
discipline inspection commission, the provincial supervisory 
department, the power industrial department, and the pricing 
department should continuously regard the issue concerning the 
rural areas' electricity prices as an important task and firmly 
grasp it. The staff and workers contingents of the power 
industrial units should well be consolidated and managed. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: At present, we should also 
strengthen the propaganda and education for the peasants and 
urge them not only to resist unreasonable burdens but also to 
fulfill the duties that every citizen should fulfill. So, the 
peasants should ensure the delivery of grain in good quality and 
full quantity and automatically hand over to higher levels the 
money to be obtained by the higher levels in a reasonable and 
unified way.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday [31 May] morning, the provincial 
party committee and government jointly held a meeting of leading 
cadres of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial government to brief them on results of the 
investigation of department leading bodies, which was conducted 
by the provincial party committee. The meeting urged further 
implementation of the responsibility system of leading bodies of 
the departments directly under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial government and improvement and strengthening their 
ideological construction and work style, and [words indistinct]. 
  Vice Governor Chen Yiling presided over the meeting. Seated 
in the front row of the rostrum were Yan Haiwang [provincial 
party secretary], Sun Ying and Yang Zhenjie, Zhong Zhaolong, Lu 
Hao, and Han Zhengqing. 
  In his report to the meeting, Sun Ying said: During the 
investigation, 34 cadres were transferred to form six 
investigation teams. In the last 10-days of February, the teams 
began conducting an overall investigation in three batches of 
the leading bodies of 50 selected departments directly under the 
jurisdiction of the provincial government. Judging from the 
investigation results, most of the leading bodies were good or 
relatively good. However, there were also problems that should 
not be overlooked. Their main manifestations were as follows: 
A small number of leading cadres [words indistinct] and failed 
to meet the requirements of the development of the situation in 
terms of ideological conceptions and culture mix. [passage 
indistinct] A tiny number of leading cadres abused power to 
seek personal gain and performed official duties dishonestly, 
thus arousing discontent among the masses of people. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the meeting, Yan Haiwang made a speech which centered on 
the issues of implementing the responsibility system of leading 
bodies of departments directly under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial government and job target responsibility. He said: 
Implementing the responsibility system of leading bodies is 
crucial to completion of work in various fields of endeavor this 
year, necessary for development of the socialist market economy 
and for the deepening of reform of the political structure, and 
important to strengthening ideological construction and 
improving work styles. [passage omitted] 
  Yan Haiwang emphatically pointed out that the general 
requirement for provincial authorities to implement the 
responsibility system of leading bodies and job target 
responsibility is to heighten one's fighting spirit, fulfill 
one's duties diligently and honestly, get united and 
coordinated, and do solid work. He said: 
  Specifically speaking, first, the principal leader 
responsibility system should be implemented effectively. 
[passage omitted] 
  Second, supervision, inspection, and assessment should be 
strengthened and discipline should be strictly enforced. 
[passage omitted] 
  Third, government functions should be transformed and 
services strengthened. [passage omitted] 
  Fourth, it is necessary to establish a job target 
responsibility system, heighten one's fighting spirit, and do 
solid work. [passage omitted] 
  Fifth, it is necessary to study more, toughen party spirit, 
and [words indistinct]. 
  Finally, Yan Haiwang urged the broad masses of cadres and 
people to work hard with one heart and one mind, do their 
duties, and make due contributions to the development of the 
province's two civilization building.

  [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu, on behalf of the Republic of China [ROC] Government, 
decorated Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, Indonesia's state minister 
in charge of research and technology, with the Order of 
Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon Friday [10 June] in recognition 
of his contribution to promoting substantive ties between Taipei 
and Jakarta. 
  The decoration ceremony was not open to the media because 
the 
Indonesian Government asked the ROC to keep Habibie's visit low 
profile in order not to irritate Beijing, with which Jakarta 
maintains diplomatic ties. 
  After the ceremony, Chien and Habibie exchanged views on 
matters of mutual concern. Chien later gave a luncheon in honor 
of Habibie, an engineer-turned administrator. 
  Habibie, heading a large group of Indonesian trade, 
technology and agriculture officials as well as business 
leaders, arrived in Taipei Thursday evening for a three-day 
visit. 
  Habibie helped arrange president Li Teng-hui's itinerary in 
Indonesia when Li made a groundbreaking unofficial visit to the 
Southeast Asian nation in February. He accompanied Li to tour 
many Indonesian industrial and agricultural institutions. 
  Habibie told local reporters that although he is not a 
member 
of the organizing committee for the 1994 summit of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he will try his 
best to have Li invited to the meeting, slated for November in 
Jakarta. 
  Nevertheless, Habibie said, he cannot at the moment predict 
whether Li will be able to attend the meeting. 
  Because of Beijing's boycott, Li failed to attend the 
first-ever APEC leadership meeting held in Seattle last 
November. Both Taipei and Beijing are APEC members. 
  Habibie, the chief architect of Indonesia's aerospace 
industry, said he will explore the possibility of Taipei-Jakarta 
cooperation in aerospace technology development during his stay 
here. 
  "There is still ample room for our two countries to 
cooperate," the Indonesian minister noted. 
  Habibie will leave Taiwan for Japan Saturday. 
  Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, substantive 
relations 
between Taiwan and Indonesia have grown steadily in recent 
years. According to statistics released by the Indonesian 
Government, aggregate direct Taiwan investment in Indonesia 
reached US$8.68 billion at the end of April, making Taiwan the 
second largest foreign investor in that country after Japan.

  [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- The Swedish aircraft 
manufacturer Saab has decided to make Taiwan a maintenance 
center for Saab airplanes operating in the Asia-Pacific region, 
Chairman Hans Kruger said Friday [10 June]. 
  During a meeting with Mao Chih-kuo, director-general of the 
Civil Aeronautics Administration, Kruger said he is confident 
that Taiwan is capable of becoming an Asian aircraft maintenance 
center with its skilled work force and increasingly upgraded 
facilities. 
  Saab is cooperating with Formosa Airlines in expanding and 
upgrading a Formosa maintenance shop in Taichung to use as a 
base for the maintenance center, Kruger said. 
  Several Formosa technicians have received a Collins' license 
for overhauling engines and navigation systems, certifying them 
capable of doing the maintenance work here rather than sending 
the machinery abroad for overhaul, according to an official of 
the Taipei-based airlines. 
  Saab will also help Formosa acquire sophisticated equipment 
for aircraft safety inspections, such as X-ray systems and eddy 
current systems, the official said. 
  Formosa Airlines, with seven 37-seat Saab-340b's in domestic 
flight service, is expanding its fleet with three 67-seat Saab- 
2000's and three 107-seat Fokker 100's, the official added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Zhou Nan, director of 
the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, expressed his hope here 
that the broad masses of Hong Kong Government functionaries will 
remain in Hong Kong after 1997, serve in the future special 
administrative region, and continue to contribute to the welfare 
of the broad masses of Hong Kong people. 
  Zhou Nan made the statement while meeting and feting key 
personnel in charge of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants 
Association [CCSA] which is the largest organization of 
government functionaries in Hong Kong. He said, "When handling 
issues on government functionaries, including their appointment, 
promotion, welfare, and remuneration, the Chinese Government 
will strictly abide by relevant provisions of the Basic Law. 
There will not be a so-called `major reshuffle' let alone such 
an issue as `settling accounts afterward'." 
  Zhou Nan expressed his hope that the Hong Kong Government 
functionaries will make more contributions to serve the society, 
ensuring a smooth transition of Hong Kong in 1997, and to 
safeguard Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. 
Meanwhile, he also hoped that the CCSA will further exercise 
its influence in this regard, and will continually unite the 
broad masses of government functionaries so that they will 
retain their posts and continue to serve in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Speaking at the banquet, Zhou Nan commended the CCSA for its 
continuing efforts to fight for the rational rights and 
interests of government functionaries for a prolonged period, 
and affirmed the CCSA's contributions to Hong Kong society. He 
also indicated his appreciation for the CCSA's stance that 
government functionaries should be "apolitical" and for its 
practical, steady, earnest, and responsible work style. 
  CCSA leaders commented on the CCSA's celebration of its 80th 
founding anniversary in 1994. They also expressed their views 
on issues including government functionaries' pension saving 
fund, their appointments and working conditions, their 
localization issue, and their transfer to another administrative 
system.

  [Text] From January to May this year, the province 
exported goods worth $770 million or so in its trade with 
foreign countries, an increase of 41 percent over the same 
period last year. 
  The export sector witnessed a relatively big increase in 
efficiency. Since the beginning of this year, the sector has 
been confronted with serious difficulties, such as funding 
shortages, high domestic prices, and a drop in overseas prices, 
which hampered foreign exchange earnings from exports and 
improved efficiency. To implement the plan for the entire year 
to earn foreign exchange through exports and achieve better 
efficiency, leaders of the provincial party committee and 
government have repeatedly handled business on the spot in 
foreign trade companies to solve practical problems. The 
provincial economic relations and trade commission has also 
repeatedly held special meeting to analyze economic activities 
and to strive for unity in thinking and solutions to improving 
economic efficiency, gave specific guidance to companies 
according to their own concrete conditions, encouraged 
enterprises with relatively good efficiency in exporting goods 
to expand their scale and strive for better efficiency, guided 
companies which had problems with exports and efficiency to make 
more effort to improve efficiency, and helped solve practical 
problems to boost enthusiasm for earning more foreign exchange 
by exporting more goods and striving for better efficiency. 
Nevertheless, the development of the province's foreign trade 
is not balanced. Provincial-level companies have strengthened 
management and have persisted in not engaging in loss-making 
deals, thus gaining better economic efficiency, however, 
prefecture and city-level companies, with the exception of those 
in Changsha City, all suffered losses in operations. In 
particular, the 29 industrial export enterprises, which have 
been approved by the state over the last two years, and four 
prefecture and county-level companies had yet to export goods to 
earn foreign exchange by the end of May.

Lang-juo (0719 2597 5387), Liu Chung (0491 3095): "Hunan 
Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin Says Hunan 
Displays the Superiority of a Big Province, Its Inflation Rate 
May be Lower Than 15 Percent This Year"] 
  [Text] Changsha, 2 June (WEN WEI PO) -- Hunan Provincial 
Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin said in a special 
interview with these reporters: In the reform year, Hunan 
Province is confident of keeping the inflation rate below 15 
percent. Meanwhile, we are going to enhance the reform of 
state-owned enterprises and give full play to the superiority of 
our role as a major agricultural province, and foreign 
businessmen are welcome to invest in Hunan's infrastructure 
construction. 
  Wang Maolin said: Owing to the introduction of some reform 
measures and the effect of investment, in the first two months 
of this year, the rate of commodity price rises in Hunan was 
quite high, greater than the national average. Therefore, Hunan 
Province has taken a series of regulatory measures and made use 
of the advantage of having a plentiful supply of goods and 
materials on hand to rapidly put large numbers of commodities on 
the market, particularly such necessities of people's lives as 
rice, vegetables, and meat. Meanwhile, price ceilings are set 
on farm and sideline products and the trend of rapid and 
excessive price rises is brought under control in a very short 
time. In April, prices rises in Hunan were lower than the 
national average level. Regarding the controlled target of 
inflation this year, Wang Maolin said: With the introduction of 
grain price reform in June, commodity prices may be much 
affected, but we are very confident of keeping the inflation 
rate below 15 percent. 
  Talking about this year's reform tasks, Wang Maolin said: 
This year, Hunan Province will lay stress on coordinating with 
reform measures introduced by the central authorities to 
guarantee implementation of the measures. Meanwhile, we will 
enhance reform of state-owned enterprises. We will resolutely 
urge enterprises not running well for a long time to declare 
bankruptcy, encourage enterprises achieving good benefit to 
merge with enterprises with unreasonable product structures, and 
take measures, such as auctioning off some enterprises and 
letting state-owned enterprises be run by the private sector, to 
improve enterprise economic benefits and reduce deficits. 
  Wang Maolin said: Hunan is a major agricultural province 
with the output of paddy rice and live pigs ranking first in our 
country. Hunan has made great contributions to our country, but 
our villages are not as well-off as they should be, mainly 
because processing work has failed to keep up with development. 
As long as we can make enough efforts in the depth and quality 
of processing and packing, and give wide publicity to the 
products, Hunan's agriculture will be able to advance to a new 
stage. Wang Maolin specially pointed out that as a major 
agricultural province, Hunan's products should have a 
considerable market share in Hong Kong. He said that foreign 
businesses are welcome to invest in Hunan, particularly in 
infrastructure construction. He continued: The Hunan section 
of the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway is 570 kilometers in length. 
At present, apart from support pledged by the World Bank and 
the Asian Development Bank, we are trying to raise funds from 
various channels, and domestic and overseas businesses are 
welcome to invest in this "golden road." Talking about the 
construction in the energy sector, Wang Maolin said: Hong 
Kong's China Light and Power Company is talking with us about 
joint-venture construction of a thermal power plant in Changde. 
The China Light and Power Company will own 40 percent of the 
stock. At present, both sides have signed a letter of intent on 
cooperation.

  [Text] From 31 May to 1 June, Chen Bangzhu, provincial 
party committee deputy secretary and provincial governor, 
inspected and guided work in Lingling Prefecture. 
  Speaking on Lingling's industrial production, Governor Chen 
Bangzhu pointed out: Industrial enterprises have always been a 
hard nut to crack and a focal point of Hunan's overall work. It 
is imperative to speed up the enterprise property rights system 
reform to give more scope to the dominant role of the public 
ownership system. This, he noted, was a matter of great 
significance to Hunan's overall work. In so doing, we should 
see to it that state-owned assets are not siphoned off. 
Moreover, we should comprehensively and unhesitatingly assist 
and equip each and every city-based small factory. 
  Speaking about improving Lingling's industrial enterprises, 
Governor Chen Bangzhu emphatically pointed out: The key to 
improving Lingling's industrial enterprises lies in tapping 
latent potential, laying a solid foundation, enhancing reserve 
strength, and stepping up lateral cooperation. 
  In view of Lingling's poor and weak industrial foundation 
and 
irrational industrial structure, Governor Chan Bangzhu called on 
comrades in charge of Lingling Prefecture to redouble efforts 
and build more infrastructure facilities, including more water 
supply networks, more electricity supply networks, and more 
highway networks.

<F P=106> [By Gao Jin'an: "Urban Plans to Vitalize Investment in </F>
Nanning"] 
  [Text] Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, has unveiled a major programme for infrastructural 
development to woo foreign investors and to catch up with the 
better-developed coastal cities. 
  The investment will mainly go to projects in transportation, 
telecommunications, energy, power and other urban projects, a 
senior city official announced yesterday at a press conference 
in Beijing. 
  Xie Ruxuan, mayor of Nanning, said the city will invest over 
3 billion yuan ($344 million) this year into the projects, a 40 
per cent increase over last year. 
  He promised that infrastructure funding will continue to 
rise 
in the coming years to further improve its investment climate 
and build the city into a transportation hub linking Southwest 
and South China with Southeast Asia. 
  Nanning, with a population of 2.6 million, is located at the 
centre of the autonomous region and serves as an important venue 
for Southwest and Central China. 
  At present, the Nanning-Kunming Railway, a trunkline 
connecting both ends of Southwest China, is under construction 
and will be completed in 1997. A number of highways and 
expressways are also being built or planned. 
  The State Council in 1992 granted Nanning the same policies 
given to coastal cities in the early 1980s, providing a good 
chance for Nanning to catch up with the coast. 
  In the past two years, the city has approved nearly 400 
foreign- funded enterprises with a promised investment of about 
$1 billion. The joint ventures and investments include projects 
in transportation, energy, agriculture, commerce, real estate 
development and industry. 
  Xie said about 60 per cent of the city's total $34.46 
million 
in exports were produced by joint ventures. 
  Last year, the industrial output value topped 10 billion 
yuan 
($1.15 billion) for the first time, an increase of 18.7 per cent 
over the previous year. 
  In a sign of its robust economy, the city has no industrial 
stockpile, as 99.7 per cent of its products are sold on the 
market, Xie noted. 
  The city plans to invest 16 billion yuan ($1.84 billion) in 
the next six years to start 31 major industrial projects, but 
the mayor did not go into detail on the projects. 
  The capacity of its digital telephone system exceeded 88,500 
lines last year, compared with 15,000 lines in 1990. This year, 
the city will invest 500 million yuan ($57 million).

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporters Ai Feng (5337 0023) and Bao </F>
Hongjun (7637 3163 0193): "Reduce the Number of Overseers, 
Increase the Number of Sanitary Inspectors--Ruan Chongwu Talks 
About the General Idea for Reforming Hainan Province"] 
  [Text] "It is necessary to reduce the number of overseers 
but increase the number of sanitary inspectors." This is a 
remark very easy to understand which was made by Hainan Governor 
Ruan Chongwu when talking about how government functions should 
be transformed in the course of establishing a socialist market 
economy. Some explorations have been made in theory and 
practice according to the above idea. 
  These reporters interviewed him in Haikou a few days ago in 
order to know what actually happened. 
  [Reporter] What do you think of the above simple and 
figurative expression concerning the transformation of 
government functions? 
  [Ruan Chongwu] Before answering this question, I should like 
to explain the following view first: The readjustment of 
interests is an issue that cannot be evaded in carrying out 
reform. Generally speaking, our reform is in the interests of 
the state, nation, and people. Meanwhile, reform is also a 
process in which the interest pattern is repeatedly readjusted. 
In the course of specific readjustments during a certain 
period, four circumstances--gaining a lot, gaining a little, 
gaining nothing, and gaining less--may occur. Interest 
relationships will, to a certain extent, affect people's 
attitude toward reform. 
  A great majority of the people in our country have benefited 
from reform, which is also very obvious in Hainan. Since the 
founding of the province six years ago, more than 200 
enterprises directly under the provincial authority have 
increased their vitality, as most of them have transformed 
operational mechanisms and adapted themselves to the market. A 
great majority of the masses have also enhanced their living 
standards. However, in a certain stage of the reform process, 
some enterprises may suffer losses and the income of their staff 
and workers may be affected. This situation calls for our 
government to exercise the role of leader and guide and take 
care to exert influence on the main bodies of social behavior so 
that the masses will, in light of the overall and long-term 
interests, adopt a correct attitude toward the current 
difficulty, continue to participate in reform enthusiastically, 
and unite as one to strive for a magnificent future. 
  [Reporter] What has the view that you just talked about to 
do with the transformation of government functions? 
  [Ruan] They are quite closely related. In the course of 
moving from a planned economy to a market economy, fundamental 
changes have taken place in the mode of allocating social 
resources. Human, financial, material, and other resources which 
were previously distributed by government planning are gradually 
changed to be primarily allocated by the market. With regard to 
government departments, their previous authority in target 
assignment, examination, and approval have now been withdrawn, 
or the procedures have been changed. If the minds of government 
personnel are still confined in outmoded conventions, they will 
feel "frustrated." Moreover, they will even feel that their 
interests have been damaged because they have lost certain real 
power which they possessed in the past. Though the great 
majority of our government personnel are good, if this issue is 
not properly resolved, some of them will consciously or 
unconsciously take a passive attitude toward reform measures. 
In the meantime, the masses will find it difficult to approach 
government personnel for handling affairs as they are afraid of 
seeing the unpleasant countenance of the personnel. If things 
go on like this, the administrative efficiency and reputation of 
the government, being the leader and booster of reform, will be 
adversely affected, and the smooth progress of reform as a whole 
will certainly be affected too. 
  [Reporter] Is it for the purpose of enhancing government 
personnel's reform consciousness that you have clearly put forth 
this issue? 
  [Ruan] Yes. Such consciousness is chiefly manifested in the 
following two aspects: On one hand, every government worker 
must more consciously treat and handle the issue in light of the 
overall interests of reform. Our people's government has the 
obligation to serve the people wholeheartedly, so it and its 
personnel have no longer any interests of their own to consider 
except for those of the state and the people. Hence, every 
worker should seek his own development in serving the people. 
On the other hand, government workers should perform their work 
more consciously, vigorously, and in a clear-cut manner in their 
specific actions of transforming government functions. 
  "Small government, big society" is an important experience 
we 
have gained. If government organs are excessively big, not only 
do we have to increase administrative expenditure, but many 
personnel have to "look for something to do." In this way, they 
will take up this and check up that, only disturbing people and 
making trouble for enterprises. We have carried out reform in 
this area. In the future, we will divert some of our personnel 
to work in enterprises or in the service sector. 
  "Reducing the number of overseers but increasing the number 
of sanitary inspectors" is our general idea. Previously, 
government departments were in charge of a good many links in 
examination and approval, so they were regarded as "overseers." 
What the market economy needs most, however, are not overseers, 
but those exercising standardized management and supervision. 
Hence, they are vividly likened to "sanitary inspectors." More 
overseers mean more expenses, which not only increase the cost 
of handling affairs, but reduce work efficiency. In addition, 
the practice also provides opportunities of "seeking personal 
gain by abuse of power" to a few personnel who lack strict 
self-discipline. Since last year, our work to transform 
government functions has started from this. For example, 
according to the principle of "relaxing the procedures of 
examination and approval while tightening management work" under 
the new enterprise registration system which we have practiced 
for a year, more than 100 units in charge of examination and 
approval have been abolished, and only 24 are licensed to carry 
on the work. This action has been well received, and, in a 
certain sense, it has removed the cause of corruption in the 
area of structure. Hainan's reform of tax collection and 
control system and labor power employment system have been 
carried out in line with this idea. 
  [Reporter] "Reducing the number of overseers" mainly refers 
to changing the economic management method of the planned 
economy, then does "increasing the number of sanitary 
inspectors" mainly refer to how government work can be better 
suited to the development of a market economy? 
  [Ruan] Yes, you may take it this way. Under a market 
economy, both the buyer and seller determine their own actions 
in light of gaining benefit to the maximum. The most 
fundamental requirement of the market economy is: Any 
enterprise and individual can freely enter or exit the market, 
and commodities can circulate without restriction. Therefore, 
the creation of a fine environment for free circulation in the 
commodity, service, and factor markets is a matter that the 
government should consider as top priority. In the past, there 
were quite a few regulations restricting free entry, exit, and 
circulation of commodities, and production factors which should 
be considerably simplified now. For example, there were many 
check-points on the roads that had fostered the malpractice of 
levying charges arbitrarily. In Hainan this year, the practice 
of collecting charges such as highway maintenance fees and 
others by various departments has been changed to a unified levy 
of "fuel sub- charge" by the petroleum retail sales department, 
and various check-points on the roads have been totally 
abolished, thereby creating the condition for free commodity 
circulation. Of course, some concrete measures have yet to be 
improved. Another example is that if property rights are unable 
to circulate, it is very difficult to achieve the objective of 
optimum allocation of resources. For this reason, we have 
started to standardize transaction behavior in this field to 
create conditions for property rights transactions. As regards 
the labor force market, a job search agency has been set up so 
that labor force markets in the province have been initially 
centralized, which has played a remarkable role in the rational 
flow of labor force in the province. While resolving this 
issue, we should energetically carry out housing reform and 
social insurance system reform to remove anxieties arising from 
the flow of laborers. In short, we should create a fine market 
environment with the authority of the government and its fair 
service in a bid to fully mobilize the initiative of various 
social sectors and give impetus to the development in Hainan. 
  [Reporter] Now we roughly understand the meaning of your 
remark regarding "overseers" and "sanitary inspectors." It is 
associated with the idea of strolling around a park, which 
people are quite familiar with. The manager of a park is 
capable not because he sets up many gates to collect tickets, 
but because he puts in a lot of efforts to make the park very 
clean and beautiful so that people can enjoy their stroll there 
with pleasure. However, a market is not a park after all, and 
it is not omnipotent either. In the meantime, market mechanisms 
do not take effect spontaneously by solely depending on the 
market itself, because the macroeconomic regulation and control 
of the government should also be an essential component of a 
market economy. What do you think the government should do in 
this area? 
  [Ruan] Under a market economy, government's macroeconomic 
regulation and control really play an important part. In my 
opinion, the government should be adept at concretely exercising 
the functions of macroeconomic regulation and control through 
the following eight means--laws, regulations, policies, 
planning, coordination, balancing, intervention, and imposition 
of sanctions. With regard to the major projects which have 
social benefit but lack good direct economic results, the 
government must see to it that they are properly organized and 
brought into execution. What is more, the government must 
seriously manage rare resources and resources that cannot be 
regenerated, guard against monopoly, maintain fair competition 
and market order, stress efficiency while giving consideration 
to fairness; ensure rational distribution, maintain good social 
order, intensify ideological education, step up the building of 
spiritual civilization, and encourage honesty while combating 
corruption. 
  [Reporter] Judging from your above remark, it seems to me 
that the government's duties have increased rather than 
decreased, and its responsibility has become heavier rather than 
lighter. 
  [Ruan] Yes, we will continue to perform our work in line 
with this idea. 
  [Reporter] We hope that you will make even greater progress 
in your work. Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] In Guangzhou this afternoon, the provincial 
government ceremoniously held a meeting to present scientific 
and technical awards. This is one of the important parts of 
this year's scientific and technical progress month in our 
province. 
  Provincial leading comrades who attended the meeting 
included 
Xie Fei, Zhu Senlin, Huang Huahua, Lu Ruihua, Lu Zhonghe, Cheng 
Zhiqing, Zhang Zhanxia, and others. The state scientific and 
technical awards were conferred on 22 projects, and provincial 
scientific and technical awards on 163 projects involving a 
total of 265 units and 915 persons throughout the province. 
  Governor Zhu Senlin made a speech at the meeting in which he 
said: To attain Guangdong's strategic target of basically 
realizing its modernizations by 2010, our province's annual 
increase in GDP must reach over 12.9 percent. To accomplish 
this strenuous task, it is very important for us to rely on 
scientific and technical progress. For this reason, a number of 
key laboratories should be established throughout the province, 
in addition to technical research and development centers that 
are closely linked with production enterprises. We also should 
develop technical popularization networks in various localities 
and trades. We should actively develop the technology market, 
and should encourage scientific and technical research units and 
personnel to run enterprises, or to become shareholders of 
enterprises in a form of scientific and technical investment to 
promote the integration of the market, scientific research, and 
production.

  [Text] Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Xie Fei held 
talks with persons in charge of some 10 large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises based in the Guangzhou area on the 
mornings of 3 and 4 June. After conscientiously listening to 
detailed reports on enterprises production and operations, 
product marketing, circulation funds, the transformation of 
operational mechanisms, and so on, Secretary Xie Fei asked many 
specific questions. 
  On the morning of 3 June, Secretary Xie Fei held talks with 
comrades in charge of a number of light and textile industrial 
enterprises based in the Guangzhou area. The comrades in charge 
of Guangzhou Bandao Electric Appliances Company, Guangzhou 
Baiyunshan Joint-Stock Company Ltd., Guangzhou Huanan Sewing 
Equipment Company, and Guangzhou Wuyang Bicycle Company briefed 
Secretary Xie Fei on production, operations, and the 
transformation of operational mechanisms this year. After being 
told that the above-mentioned enterprises have gradually 
extricated themselves from a difficult position to varying 
degrees, worked out new development strategies in accordance 
with the new reform measures introduced by the state since the 
start of this year, and achieved initial results in all areas of 
endeavor, Secretary Xie Fei said that whether Guangzhou would be 
able to maintain the traditional superiority of its light 
industry will largely depend on enterprises' reform, 
readjustment, and reorganization, as well as the development of 
new and quality products. We should make every possible 
endeavor to explore a new road to this end. 
  Speaking of the problems facing enterprises at the moment, 
such as heavy burdens, a lack of circulation funds, and so on, 
Secretary Xie Fei noted that it is necessary to enhance 
determination and redouble efforts in this regard to basically 
resolve these problems over the next two years. At present, we 
must be determined to seize each and every opportunity to 
resolve these problems and make sound and concrete macroeconomic 
decisions to this end rather than shouting empty slogans. We 
should allocate more human resources to this area of endeavor. 
  On the morning of 4 June, Secretary Xie Fei held talks with 
comrades in charge of a number of heavy industrial and chemical 
enterprises based in the Guangzhou area. Comrades in charge of 
Guangzhou Iron and Steel Company Ltd., Guangzhou Heavy Machinery 
Plant, Guangzhou Petrochemical Plant, Fangcheng International 
Joint-Stock Company Ltd., and Guangzhou Paper Company Ltd. 
briefed Secretary Xie Fei on their development in great detail. 
After listening to the reports, Secretary Xie Fei pointed out 
that, by and large, large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises based in the Guangzhou area have already improved 
their operations to a certain extent. This shows that we have 
done a lot of work in this area and that these large and 
medium-sized enterprises have built a solid basis over the past 
decades and are now capable of enduring all types of trials. I 
am confident about improving their operations still further in 
the years to come. In all senses, large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises based in the Guangzhou area have always 
been in an extremely important position in the province. Given 
Guangdong's actual conditions, it is all the more necessary to 
maintain a large batch of large and medium-sized enterprises 
which can serve as Guangdong's industrial backbone and pillar, 
thereby pushing ahead with the province's overall industrial 
growth. 
  Secretary Xie Fei also gave the following three instructions 
concerning the development of Guangzhou's large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises: 1) clearly define property rights 
relations and transform large and medium-sized enterprises into 
genuine legal entities enjoying operational decisionmaking 
powers; 2) establish a strict and scientific enterprise 
management system within each large and medium-sized enterprise; 
3) Guarantee large and medium-sized enterprises have advanced 
production expertise and equipment. 
  Secretary Xie Fei maintained: So long as we work hard and 
strive for new breakthroughs in these three areas, 
Guangdong-based large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
will certainly be able to shake off their heavy burdens, improve 
efficiency, and take on a completely new look in the near 
future. To achieve this, we must make redoubled efforts to 
improve work in this area.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Expressway 
construction in south China's Guangdong Province is attracting 
attention from big financial groups abroad. 
  So far, more than four billion U.S. dollars from abroad has 
been put into or has been promised to 15 ongoing projects. 
  A 120-km expressway costing 1.2 billion U.S. dollars will 
link this capital of the province with the boom town of 
Shenzhen. The project has already received 1.56 billion Hong 
Kong dollars from the Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings Ltd and 
a loan of 800 million U.S. dollars from international 
consortiums. 
  Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong tycoon, has injected 100 million 
U.S. Dollars into the building of a freeway from Shenzhen to 
Shantou, which will need 2.5 billion yuan in total. 
  Two Malaysian companies, the Ho Hup Construction Company 
Berhad and United Engineers Berhad, have poured 6.6 billion yuan 
into the building of a 188-km expressway from Yangjiang to 
Zhanjiang. 
  Li Shaofeng, general manager of the province's expressway 
construction company, said that the market outlook is good as 
the number of vehicles has been soaring in Guangdong in recent 
years. 
  The province had 3.27 million vehicles in 1993, compared 
with 
only 747,000 in 1985. 
  Low risks and high returns in the projects have also enticed 
overseas investors, he said. 
  An expressway running from Guangzhou to Foshan, the 
province's first foreign-financed road, has a daily income of 
300,000 yuan, tenfold the figure four years ago. 
  Meanwhile, the province is to raise foreign capital through 
new measures. For instance, foreigners will be allowed to 
operate freeways for limited periods. 
  By the end of this century the province is expected to have 
over 1,300 km of expressways.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Liang Chun (2733 </F>
6511): "Guangdong Retains 80 Development Zones Involving 
Investment of 100 Billion Yuan"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 7 June -- From 1984, when the State 
Council established the first development zones, until 1992, a 
total of 300 development zones have been set up in Guangdong. 
Since these development zones appeared in large numbers on a 
large scale and were poorly managed, land use management was in 
chaos. Since 1993, Guangdong began screening various types of 
development zones. Yuan Zheng, director of the provincial State 
Land Department, briefed this reporter a few days ago on how 
development zones in the province have been straightened out and 
how things stand now. 
  According to Yuan, after a year of comprehensive overhaul, 
Guangdong has closed down and merged a total of 228 development 
zones established by townships and towns without authorization 
or which were approved by cities and counties. The province has 
decided to retain 83 development zones, of which 11 were 
approved by the central government, 45 approved by the 
provincial government, and 28 approved after applications were 
submitted anew. 
  Yuan pointed out that the area approved for development 
zones 
by the central and provincial government had been limited. An 
overall plan has been worked out. Under the plan, an area 
measuring 1,560 square km of land will be assigned for 
development zones. Infrastructure and land developments in most 
development zones are roughly in place, which has created a 
favorable investment environment. In most development zones, 
transport and telecommunications services and electricity and 
water supplies are basically available, and large stretches of 
land have been cleared. Statistics show that 260,000 mu of land 
has been assigned for development zones at the provincial level 
and above, and of this, 120,000 mu has been developed. About 
5,000 projects have been introduced into development zones at 
the provincial level and above, involving an investment of 110 
billion yuan. For now, a total of 20 billion yuan has been 
spent on construction and a number of projects have gone on 
stream. For example, a total of 148 projects have been 
introduced into the Qingyuan Experimental Economic Development 
Zone to support poor areas, involving an investment of 1.8 
billion yuan. The realized output value of 32 completed 
projects, which represented an investment of 800 million yuan, 
amounted to 200 million yuan last year and will increase to 1 
billion this year. The Jiedong Development Zone has introduced 
135 projects with a planned investment of 5 billion yuan, of 
which 400 million has been injected. A number of development 
zones are entering into negotiations with investors about 
introducing a number of major construction projects. For 
instance, the Shuidong Development Zone is planning to build a 
refinery producing 20 million tonnes of oil each year and an 
ethylene plant with an annual production capacity of 45 tonnes 
of ethylene [figure as published], and the Zhanjiang Donghaidao 
Development Zone plans a steel works with an annual production 
capacity of 10 million tonnes. 
  The development zones feature new methods of operation, new 
management techniques, and new approaches to land development, 
utilization, and management. Yuan said that the development 
zones have rationally arranged land for construction projects 
according to the basic state policy of ensuring arable land is 
not reduced. The planned area for development zones at 
provincial level and above throughout the province totals 2.34 
million mu, of which 820,000 mu is under cultivation, accounting 
for 3.5 percent of the total, less than the national average. 
The planned area of the Shuidong Development Zone is 120,000 
mu, of which 16,000 mu is arable land, 1.3 percent of the total. 
The Yuebei Industrial Development Zone has obtained land for 
construction projects by making use of marshland and has 
reclaimed 70 hectares of land. 
  The development zones also feature a centralized monopoly of 
land. The local city or county government or the development 
zone management committee sees to it that land comes under 
unified planning, unified requisition, unified development, 
unified transfer, and unified management. This ensures smooth 
implementation of construction plans and that sufficient land is 
assigned for projects. 
  Yuan said that a series of preferential policies also helped 
the development zones in land development. The development zone 
management can make its own decision on land use, including 
giving priority to certain projects. The development zone 
management is also allowed to adopt flexible land pricing 
policies. Land for industrial and high-tech projects will be 
transferred at cost price or at cost price plus an appropriate 
amount of subsidy. The buyer is allowed to develop the whole 
stretch of land through construction projects on an appropriate 
scale and to accept or transfer land use rights in the form of 
rent in kind, including exchanging highways or bridges for land. 
There are no restrictions on selling commodity houses abroad, 
and the client is exempt from land use charges for a number of 
years. With these preferential policies, the development zones 
have made great progress in land development and utilization. 
  The current situation with regard to the development, 
utilization, and management of land in development zones is very 
good on the whole. However, major problems still exist. For 
instance, disorderly land management in one or two development 
zones, an excessive area of idle land, and defective land 
management systems. Therefore, the provincial state land 
department has stressed the need to manage land in development 
zones according to the law, approve land for development zones 
strictly according to state regulations, improve the operating 
mechanism of the market for development zone land, and further 
enforce a land management system characterized by "unified 
planning, unified requisition, unified development, unified 
transfer, and unified management" so that land use in 
development zones will be legalized and standardized.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Chinese President </F>
Jiang Zemin by NHK chief commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima at 
Zhongnanhai in Beijing on 10 June; from the "NHK News 7" program 
-- Jiang and Takashima remarks recorded; Jiang speaks in Chinese 
with Japanese subtitles accompanying his remarks] 
  [Text] Chinese President Jiang Zemin gave an exclusive 
interview to NHK in Beijing on 10 June and touched on North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, saying that 
China is against imposing sanctions. In this way, he explained 
a stand of seeking a settlement through dialogue between the 
countries concerned. 
  The interview took place this morning at Beijing's 
Zhongnanhai, where the main government and the Communist Party 
offices are located. 
  [Takashima] I would like to ask you some questions 
concerning 
the issue that is now of primary concern to the world. The 
international community, with China as a central figure, is 
currently discussing North Korea's development of nuclear 
weapons. First, would you explain how China wants to resolve 
this problem? 
  [Jiang] We appeal to all parties concerned to exercise 
restraint and act prudently. In solving the problem, the 
ultimate objectives should be to safeguard peace and stability 
on the peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. As long 
as we do not deviate from these two basic objectives, there is 
always the possibility of finding a correct way to solve the 
problem, no matter what temporary difficulties might arise. We 
should see that the door to negotiations has not yet been 
closed, and that room for and the possibility of dialogue still 
exist. All parties concerned should take active measures to 
avoid an intensification of the crisis. Do not let the efforts 
made by all parties over the last year and more go to waste. 
  China does not approve of sanctions. This is because 
sanctions do not help to solve the problem. On the contrary, 
they will escalate the situation and have consequences which 
none of the parties are eager to see. I believe that only 
dialogue and consultations are the effective way to solve the 
problem, as well as the fundamental way out. We have always 
hoped that the four parties and three sides [si fang san bian] 
will hold very good consultations. 
  [Announcer] President Jiang stressed the stand that the 
DPRK, 
the ROK, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] should continue discussing the matter. Moreover, 
President Jiang also spoke about the health of Chinese supreme 
leader Deng Xiaoping. He said that Deng Xiaoping is in good 
health and that there is no need to worry about his health. 
  [Takashima] Today, President Jiang Zemin said that China 
cannot agree with the idea of imposing sanctions on North Korea. 
This is entirely consistent with China's position up to this 
point, but, the timing and forum of his statement appear to be 
significant. It comes as the IAEA and the UN Security Council 
are actually talking about adopting a resolution on sanctions. 
Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher is reported to 
have said that UN sanctions will be approved. President Jiang 
reportedly said that if they are introduced at the UN Security 
Council, China will not veto them but rather will abstain from 
voting. 
  Under such circumstances, President Jiang, in an interview 
with a foreign television network, ventured to express China's 
opposition to sanctions. All of this indicates that President 
Jiang wants to restrain the growing international pressure for 
sanctions and wants to take the initiative in negotiations. 
  In particular, President Jiang held long talks with Choi 
Kwang, the North Korean chief of staff, at [place-name 
indistinct] in Zhongnanhai four days ago, thus indicating at 
home and abroad that ties are still close between China and the 
DPRK. President Jiang's remarks today reflect his own desire to 
settle the issue through talks. At the same time, it seems that 
they can also be taken as a message to North Korea. 
  President Jiang stressed once again the need for peace and 
stability on the Korean peninsula and the importance of removing 
nuclear weapons from it. This indicates that China is worried 
that if sanctions are imposed, the resulting confusion and 
conflict will spread into China, which borders North Korea. 
Moreover, it is inevitable that refugees will cross the border, 
that China's political situation will be destabilized, and that 
it will have to step up its military readiness. This is 
apparently the last thing that China wants now while it is 
placing its top priority on economic growth. 
  Given this situation, it appears unlikely that sanctions 
will 
be imposed on the DPRK in the near future over its suspected 
development of nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin 
answered questions on China's domestic situation and important 
international issues during an interview by NHK chief 
commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima at Zhongnanhai this morning. 
  On China's position on the Korean nuclear issue, Jiang Zemin 
said: We follow with great interest current events. We always 
believe that sufficient patience is required to solve such 
complex issues as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
The greater the difficulties, the more it is necessary to keep 
calm. We appeal to all parties concerned to exercise restraint 
and act prudently. In solving the problem, the ultimate 
objectives should be to safeguard peace and stability on the 
peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. So long as we 
do not deviate from these two basic objectives, there is always 
the possibility of finding out a proper way to solve the 
problem, no matter what temporary difficulties might happen. 
  We should see that the door of negotiations has not yet been 
closed, and room to maneuver and the possibility of dialogue 
still exist. All parties concerned should take active measures 
to avoid intensifying the crisis, and not let the efforts made 
by all parties over the last year and more be wasted. China 
does not approve of sanctions. It is because sanctions do not 
help the solution of the problem. On the contrary, they will 
escalate the event and have consequences which none of the 
parties is willing to see. I believe that only dialogue and 
consultations are the effective way to solve the problem, as 
well as the fundamental way out. 
  On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang Zemin said: President Clinton 
recently announced his decision to extend China's most favored 
nation [MFN] status and to delink the human rights issue from 
the MFN status in the days to come. The decision will help 
China and the United States strengthen and expand economic 
cooperation and trade, and it conforms to the fundamental 
interests of the two countries and their peoples. I believe 
that so long as both sides consider the future, the world 
situation as a whole, and their fundamental interests, adhere to 
the principles set in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, 
enhance trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and avoid 
confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly and 
healthily. 
  Jiang Zemin also expressed his views on Sino-Japanese 
relations. He said: Despite several changes in Japan's 
political scene, the friendly cooperation between China and 
Japan in various fields is still progressing steadily. Japan's 
various parties in the government and the public and the broad 
masses of the Japanese people are of the same view in 
strengthening and developing the good-neighborly, friendly, and 
cooperative relations between China and Japan. Established on 
the basis of extensive common interests and long historical and 
cultural origins, as well as on a solid mass foundation, the 
Sino-Japanese friendship is full of great vitality. A politician 
should conform to the historical trend and do some solid deeds 
for the development of bilateral relations. The 20th century is 
coming to an end soon. There is a civilian organization between 
China and Japan -- the 21st Century Committee for China- Japan 
Friendship. It indicates that both Chinese and Japanese peoples 
wish to bring Sino-Japanese relations characterized by mutual 
understanding and trust, equality, cooperation, and common 
prosperity into the 21st century, so the friendship between the 
two countries will pass on from generation to generation. I am 
fully confident in the future of Sino-Japanese relations. 
  When the reporter asked about China's stand on Japan's 
becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC], 
Jiang Zemin said: We have noticed that Japan wishes to become a 
permanent member of the UNSC and play a greater role in 
international affairs. We understand and attach importance to 
such a wish. China is in favor of expanding the size of UNSC 
when the time is ripe to reflect the reality of the changing 
international situation, and the increasing number of UN 
members. We maintain, in the meantime, that the wealth of a 
country should not be the sole condition taken into 
consideration, and that the principle of fair regional 
distribution, and the principle of unanimity in consultation 
should be fully honored in approaching this issue. The reform 
of the UNSC is presently at the preliminary stage, and opinions 
should be solicited from the vast number of its members on 
specific ways to carry out the reform. 
  Hatsuhisa Takashima is a senior commentator on international 
issues in Japan and has interviewed numerous famous world 
leaders. President Jiang Zemin met him once in November 1989.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that China is very much concerned about 
the latest development of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  He made these remarks in an interview here this morning with 
Hatsuhisa Takashima, chief commentator of the Japan Broadcasting 
Corporation [NHK]. 
  Jiang said: "It is China's consistent stand that it needs 
enough patience to find a solution to such a complicated issue 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  "We should keep calm at a time when it is more difficult and 
urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act with 
caution," he said. 
  Jiang said the goal for the settlement of the issue is 
finally to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean peninsula 
and realize denuclearization. 
  No matter what temporary difficulties may appear, he said, 
it 
is possible to find a proper solution to this problem as long as 
these two major objectives are not departed from. 
  Jiang said it is imperative to see that the door for 
negotiation is not completely closed, adding that there still 
exist possibilities of holding dialogue. 
  He urged all parties concerned to take positive measures so 
as to avoid acceleration of the crisis and not to make all 
parties' efforts wasted. 
  Jiang said China is not in favor of imposing sanctions 
because that is useless for the settlement of the problem. On 
the contrary, he added, it would aggravate the escalation of the 
situation and lead to a serious consequence that all parties 
concerned do not want to see. 
  He said: "It is my view that persevering in dialogue and 
consultations is an effective and fundamental way to solve the 
problem." 
  During the more than one-hour interview, Jiang also answered 
questions on a series of other major international issues raised 
by Takashima. 
  On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's recent delink of China's most favoured nation status 
with the human rights issue was beneficial to strengthening and 
expanding bilateral economic cooperation and trade. 
  It conforms to the fundamental interests of the two 
countries 
and the two peoples, he said. 
  Jiang said as long as the two sides look towards the future 
and the whole world, proceed from their fundamental interests, 
abide by the principles defined by the three Sino-U.S. joint 
communiques to increase mutual trust, reduce troubles, develop 
cooperation and not to practise confrontation, the Sino-U.S. 
relationship will grow smoothly and healthily.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that he was full of confidence about the 
growth of the ties between China and Japan. 
  In an interview here this morning with Hatsuhisa Takashima, 
chief commentator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation [NHK], 
Jiang said the Japanese political situation had changed on 
several occasions. 
  But, he said, the friendly cooperation between the two 
countries in every field was still growing in a stable way. 
  He said Japanese parties in and outside the government, and 
Japan's people, share views on the expansion of bilateral good- 
neighborly ties. 
  Jiang said the China-Japan friendship established on the 
basis of their common interests and a long history of culture 
and on the grass-roots level is full of strong vitality. 
  A statesman, he said, should seriously do practical things 
to 
conform to the historical trend of the times. 
  Jiang said the 20th century will come to an end. The 
existence of a Sino-Japanese non-governmental committee on the 
21st century showed that the two peoples are willing to take the 
Sino-Japanese ties of mutual understanding, mutual trust, 
equality and cooperation and common prosperity into the 21st 
century, carrying on such friendship from generation to 
generation. 
  "I have full confidence in the future development of such 
relationship," he said. 
  When asked about China's stand on Japan's hope of becoming a 
permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, 
Jiang said: "We have noticed Japan's hope of being a permanent 
member of the U.N. Security Council so as to play a greater role 
in international affairs. 
  "We appreciate and attach great importance to your desire," 
Jiang said. 
  He said China agreed to appropriately enlarge the security 
council when the time was ripe, to reflect the changing 
international situation and the facts of increasing membership 
of the United Nations. 
  At the same time, Jiang said: "We should not take the poor 
or the rich country as the only condition to consider this issue. 
  "It is imperative to fully demonstrate the principles of the 
rational regional distribution and the coordination of 
consultation," he said. 
  At present, the U.N. Security Council is in a stage of 
discussing reform, so it needs to fully listen to the opinions 
of member states. 
  Takashima, a well-known Japanese commentator on 
international 
affairs, has interviewed many countries' leaders. Chinese 
President Jiang first met him in November, 1989.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (AFP) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
urged the IAEA Monday to provide Beijing with more details on 
North Korea's nuclear programme to enable it to make a firm 
decision on the best course of action in the crisis. 
  Australian Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe said Li had made 
clear to him that Beijing's "knowledge was incomplete," 
emphasising the point that "the IAEA might assist by providing 
China with more information that it could use to make a firmer 
judgement." 
  China, which has consistently opposed imposing sanctions on 
North Korea, has also expressed its willingness to play a 
"constructive" role to resolve the crisis, sparked by North 
Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) access to its nuclear facilities. However, Beijing also 
emphasised that its influence over its neighbour and its 
knowledge of North Korea's nuclear programme -- suspected by the 
United States to be developing a nuclear bomb -- is limited. 
  "Certainly I didn't get much hint of support for sanctions, 
but I did get a sense that China was prepared to play a role 
that was constructive," said Howe, in China on an eight-day 
visit. "There was implied there recognition that China needed 
to be brought into the game more and trusted to play that role 
... that China needed to be trusted with a bit more confidence 
to use that influence" that it is assumed to have over North 
Korea, Howe told journalists. 
  As support grows for U.S. calls for sanctions against North 
Korea, the stance of China -- which has a veto as a permanent 
member of the United Nations Security Council -- is critical. 
China abstained Friday in an IAEA vote to suspend technical 
assistance to North Korea.

<F P=106> [By Kim Song-yong from Hong Kong] </F>
  [Text] Western diplomatic sources in Hong Kong said on 11 
June that China promised to send a ground army of approximately 
85,000 troops to North Korea if a war breaks out on the Korean 
peninsula and, also, to provide credit assistance -- such as 
food and energy -- to the latter if UN economic sanctions are 
effected. 
  The sources said: Such an agreement between China and North 
Korea was discussed between the key leaders of the North Korean 
party and government, who visited China in early June, and the 
relevant high-level officials of the Chinese party and Army. As 
a result, a final agreement was reached during the visit by Choe 
Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, to 
China on 7 June. 
  Prior to these remarks, a military source in Hong Kong once 
said that according to the China-North Korea Friendly Treaty 
signed in 1961, China has formulated plans to support North 
Korea by sending ground troops between 50,000 and 75,000 
soldiers -- who belong to the three divisions of the 39th 
Shenyang Military District Army stationed in Dalian -- as well 
as approximately 10,000 rapid deployment troops [sinsok 
paechigun] of the Jinan Military District to the latter. The 
source said, however, that China will send its troops to North 
Korea only if North Korea is cornered as a result of an invasion 
by the United States and South Korea, and that if North Korea 
invades South Korea, China will not directly provide military 
support to North Korea, except for spare parts or ammunition for 
the Chinese-made weapons North Korea currently possesses. 
  The sources said: Prior to the China visit by Choe Kwang, 
chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, North Korea 
had sent over 10 high-level leaders from each ministry -- such 
as the Workers Party of Korea, the Army, the Ministry of 
People's Armed Forces, the Ministry of Public Security, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Metal Industry 
-- to Beijing to discuss the issues -- such as China's 
participation in a war if it breaks out on the Korean peninsula, 
as well as its economic support for North Korea if the United 
Nations imposes economic sanctions on North Korea -- with the 
relevant Chinese authorities, including leaders of the Communist 
Party of China and its People's Liberation Army. In return for 
China's support for North Korea, North Korea has proposed that 
it will grant China the right to use the ports in the East Sea 
areas, and that it will provide materials such as nonferrous 
metals and cement to China. 
  They also said: Kim Kyong-hui, younger sister of Kim 
Chong-il, a director of the Light Industrial Department of the 
Workers Party of Korea, visited Beijing in late May to hold a 
working-level meetings with the Chinese side in order to discuss 
its economic support for North Korea. She is expected to return 
home around 13 June.

  [Text] Vienna, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution here today to 
suspend its technical aid to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK). 
  The resolution, adopted at a meeting of the IAEA Board of 
Governors, said that the DPRK, as a party to the treaty on non- 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, failed to carry out the main 
part of the IAEA's safeguards agreement and prevented the IAEA 
from inspecting its nuclear facilities. 
  The resolution called on the DPRK to cooperate fully with 
the 
IAEA secretariat and guarantee the IAEA access to all the 
documents and places concerned. 
  The resolution said the IAEA decided to stop its non-medical 
aid to DPRK. This means that the country will lose about a 
quarter of a million U.S. dollars' worth of technical aid and 
support for its civil nuclear program each year. 
  A Chinese representative pointed out at the meeting that 
losing one opportunity to conduct technical inspection did not 
mean that all the hopes to settle the nuclear issue have been 
lost. 
  He said the key point at present is that all parties 
concerned should calm down, make specific efforts and leave some 
leeway for solving problems. 
  "To go to the extreme and resort to confrontation, pressure 
and embargo will never achieve good results," he declared. 
  The Chinese representative said that it was difficult for 
China to support the resolution and expressed his deep concerns 
over possible consequences. 
  Twenty-eight countries voted for the resolution sponsored by 
18 countries including the United States, Japan, France and 
Russia and one against while two countries, including China, 
abstained and two others did not participate in voting. 
  The meeting, participated by 35 member countries of the 
Board 
of Governors, opened on June 6 with the nuclear issue in the 
DPRK being its main topic.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yang Huanqin (2799 3562 0530)] </F>
  [Text] Vienna, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- A meeting of the Board of 
Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
closed here this evening after passing a resolution on the 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  The resolution says: The DPRK, as a party to the "treaty on 
the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons," failed to carry out 
the main part of the IAEA's safeguards agreement and prevented 
the IAEA from inspecting its nuclear facilities to check the 
history of the reactor fuel rods and to determine whether the 
nuclear materials produced by its reactors have been diverted to 
other uses. The resolution called on the DPRK to cooperate 
fully with the IAEA Secretariat and to guarantee the IAEA access 
to all the documents and places concerned. The resolution says 
that the IAEA has decided to stop its nonmedical aid to the DPRK 
according to Section C of Article 12 of the IAEA Charter. 
  The representatives of the 35 member countries of the Board 
of Governors, including China, attended the meeting today. The 
Chinese representative pointed out during discussion: "The 
ultimate objectives in settling the Korean nuclear issue should 
be to ensure the denuclearization of the peninsula and to 
safeguard peace and stability there." "Losing one opportunity 
to carry out a technical inspection does not mean that all 
safeguard and supervisory opportunities and all the hopes to 
settle the nuclear issue have been lost." He said that the key 
point at present is that all parties concerned should calm down, 
make solid efforts, and leave some leeway for solving problems, 
rather than create an impasse. 
  The Chinese representative said: It is difficult for China 
to support the resolution. First, past experience proves that 
adopting a resolution is not a constructive move, and it will 
inevitably worsen the atmosphere, intensify contradictions, and 
create new difficulties in settling the Korean nuclear issue. 
Second, the suspension of technical aid to the DPRK, as 
mentioned in the resolution, is in fact a kind of sanctions. 
China is extremely worried about the possible serious 
consequences of such an action. 
  The resolution sponsored by 18 countries including the 
United 
States, Japan, France, and Russia was adopted by vote toward the 
end of the meeting. Twenty-eight countries voted for it, and 
one voted against it, while four countries, including China, 
abstained. Two others did not participate in voting. 
  The meeting of the Board of Governors opened on 6 June. With 
the Korean nuclear issue being its main topic, the meeting has 
been followed with interest by all countries of the world.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today 
welcomed the resolution of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) for sanctions against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its refusal to accept further 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry here said DPRK 
should learn a due lesson from the resolution and clearing up 
[as received] all its nuclear suspicions. 
  The IAEA resolution was passed by its Board of Governors in 
Vienna yesterday by a vote of 28 for, one against and four 
abstentions. 
  Under the resolution, IAEA would stop its technical 
assistance to DPRK, which amounts to 500,000-600,000 U.S. 
dollars a year. 
  In protest DPRK said that its nuclear program is peaceful 
and 
there should be "no more inspections" of its nuclear facilities 
by IAEA. 
  DPRK's envoy Yun Ho-chin told reporters in Vienna after the 
vote: "The DPRK will no longer guarantee the continuity of 
safeguards. The two IAEA inspectors still in (DPRK) will have to 
leave." 
  The envoy stressed at the closed-door meeting at the IAEA 
Vienna Headquarters that the DPRK seeks a negotiated solution to 
the crisis. 
  Just before the IAEA passed the resolution, DPRK Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam said in Berlin that his country would take 
"appropriate measures" if its honor, sovereignty and security 
were endangered through sanctions. 
  The current sanctions against DPRK was the fourth of its 
kind 
imposed by IAEA on its own. South Africa, Iraq and Israel were 
the preceding countries that IAEA had punished.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (XINHUA) -- South Korea, the United 
States and Japan have agreed to work for phased sanctions on the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) over the nuclear 
standoff, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  The agreement was reached at a meeting among South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of 
State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa here today. 
  The three diplomats said that sanctions against Pyongyang 
were inevitable now since the opportunity for measurements from 
DPRK's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor is damaged, ministry spokesman 
Chang Ki-ho said. 
  Earlier, the DPRK refuted the allegation that the 
measurements had become impossible, saying discharging fuel rods 
at the reactor was always under IAEA camera screening. 
  The three sides agreed that close Seoul-Washington-Tokyo 
cooperation is necessary in dealing with DPRK's nuclear issue, 
the spokesman said. 
  However, there was no report on any statement by Tarnoff and 
Kakizawa themselves after the meeting. 
  The spokesman quoted Kakizawa as saying that Japan will take 
responsible actions "within the limits of the Japanese 
Constitution" when the U.N. Security Council decides to act. 
  Tarnoff and Kakizawa arrived here over the weekend for key 
talks with South Korean officials on the nuclear controversy. 
  Strongly opposing sanctions, DPRK has stated that its 
nuclear 
program is peaceful. It warned that imposition of sanctions 
will be an act of war.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today renewed its appeal to 
the United States to work for the establishment of a new 
peace-safeguarding mechanism to guarantee peace and security in 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The DPRK renewed its appeal after the United States accused 
the DPRK of "violating the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement" by 
creating a Korean People's Army (KPA) Mission to replace the 
DPRK's delegation to the Military Armistice Commission. 
  "The U.S. side is well advised to choose to establish a new 
peace arrangement whereby the danger of war can be prevented and 
peace and security definitely guaranteed, instead of trying to 
revive the armistice mechanism whose function has been 
completely paralyzed by it," a spokesman for the KPA Mission 
said. 
  On April 28, the DPRK issued a statement through its Foreign 
Ministry proposing the establishment of a new peace mechanism to 
replace the existing Military Armistice Commission (MAC), but 
the proposal was rejected by the United States. 
  In late May, the DPRK recalled all the representatives of 
the 
KPA from the MAC and set up a KPA Mission at Panmunjom 
responsible for contact with American and South Korean military 
authorities. 
  Earlier this month, a meeting of MAC secretaries was 
proposed 
by the United States, and the DPRK sent delegates to the meeting 
under the name of the KPA Mission. 
  In response, the U.S. read a statement at the conference 
hall calling the DPRK's act a "violation of the armistice 
agreement." 
  In today's statement the spokesman said, "The establishment 
of the KPA Mission at Panmunjom was a realistic and timely step 
taken to tide over the present situation in which the armistice 
agreement had been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the MAC 
remained only in name due to the unreasonable behavior of the 
U.S. side." 
  He also charged that because of the "query by the U.S. 
side," 
both the MAC and the neutral nations supervisory commission 
exist in name only, with no role to play. 
  "Whether the U.S. accepts our new proposal or not is a 
touchstone for the fundamental question of war or peace," the 
spokesman said in the statement, released by the DPRK's official 
news agency, KCNA. 
  The DPRK and Western countries have been locked in 
controversy over the DPRK's nuclear program. The DPRK says its 
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only while Western 
countries, particularly the United States, have suspected the 
DPRK of trying to divert nuclear materials for other purposes. 
  Today in Seoul, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, in a 
phone conversation with President Clinton, reiterated his 
country's policy of close cooperation with the United States in 
handling the nuclear issue. 
  The U.S.and South Korea are attempting to seek U.N. 
sanctions 
against the DPRK, which has warned that imposition of sanctions 
would be considered as an act of war. 
  On Thursday [9 June], former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
said 
he and his wife will visit both the DPRK and South Korea next 
week as private citizens and that he hopes to discuss "important 
issues of the day with leaders." 
  "The initiative for this trip has been from Korea, not 
Washington, and I will have no official status relating to the 
U.S. Government," Carter said.

"Manmade Tension on Korean Peninsula"] 
  [Text] Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa arrived in 
Beijing yesterday on another shuttle-diplomacy visit concerning 
the Korean issue. Several days ago, high-ranking officials of 
Japan, South Korea, the DPRK, and the United States visited each 
other's countries to discuss the question of nuclear inspections. 
<H5>  The United States and Japan Dispute Sanctions </H5>
  The day before yesterday, foreign ministry officials of the 
United States, Japan, and South Korea held talks in Seoul to 
discuss the imposition of economic sanctions on the DPRK. Their 
conclusion was that sanctions should be imposed gradually. This 
is different from the U.S. earlier strong position. According 
to Japanese papers, Japan has disputed the question with the 
United States and favors the immediate adoption of such harsh 
measures as cutting off remittances sent from Koreans in Japan. 
  In the coming weeks, the United States reportedly is to seek 
UN Security Council approval of "moderate" sanctions, including 
the suspension of scientific, technological, and cultural 
exchanges, as well as of UN aid. All this generally will mean 
nothing to the DPRK, which has met with U.S. sanctions ever 
since the Korean War. Moreover, coupled with its foreign policy, 
the DPRK is comparatively isolated diplomatically and is 
accustomed to self-reliance and maintaining a closed door. It 
will not take such insignificant sanctions seriously at all. 
<H5>  U.S. Visitor's Message </H5>
  After returning from Pyongyang, Harrison, a Korean-issue 
expert of the U.S. Carnegie Organization, had this impression: 
Korean leaders take the sanctions very lightly. Judging from 
past experience, international sanctions have not played a very 
large role in Third World countries, examples being Iraq, 
Serbia, and Haiti. The sanctions will be even less effective 
for the DPRK. 
  Another noteworthy message Harrison brought back is that Kim 
Il-song is reported to have told him that he is willing to 
freeze the DPRK's nuclear program in exchange for U.S. 
diplomatic recognition. This does not sound unreliable. 
  The DPRK has shown signs of opening its door in recent 
years. 
Although the door gap is not large, air from the outside has 
kept coming in. Pyongyang repeatedly has expressed to the 
United States its wish to bury the hatchet and establish ties. 
This is a great trend in the wake of the Cold War. The United 
States, fettered by old concepts and thinking that the DPRK is 
one of the few remaining communist countries, wants to exert 
pressure to make it collapse. Thus it has made an unsolvable 
question out of an otherwise insignificant matter. It even does 
not hesitate to adopt a brink-of-war policy. 
<H5>  Both Seoul and Pyongyang Are Calm </H5>
  One phenomenon should be enlightening: While the United 
States is exaggerating the matter as being so serious that a 
Korean war might break out at any minute, both Seoul and 
Pyongyang are calm. A BBC correspondent reported from Seoul 
that residents had not the slightest fear and that there was no 
panic purchase in supermarkets, which are the "barometer of 
fear." Harrison and another British reporter said that life in 
Pyongyang is normal. Residents in Japan are even less affected. 
The tension is manmade. 
  U.S. President Clinton's Asia policy has been criticized 
extensively for wishing, on the one hand, to improve relations 
with this region, with its speedily developing economies, while 
on the other hand, acting as a bully in an overbearing manner or 
"acting as an international housekeeper, if not a bully" 
(Assistant Secretary of State Lord's words). Now that the 
United States has changed its policy on the granting of MFN 
status to China, its attitude toward Japan, India, and Singapore 
has changed too. Some media have maintained that one day, U.S. 
policy for Asia will change and become pragmatic. Whether or 
not this is true remains subject to further observation.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (XINHUA) -- Jimmy Carter, a former 
U.S. president, will visit South Korea and the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) next week in an attempt to 
find a solution to the nuclear impasse on the Korean peninsular 
[as received], official sources disclosed here Saturday [11 
June]. 
  A U.S. Administration official in Washington stressed that 
Carter is making a private visit and will not formally represent 
the U.S. Government. 
  Carter will arrive in Seoul next Tuesday for talks with 
South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. He will leave for DPRK on 
Wednesday and return to Seoul on June 18 to reveal to President 
Kim the results of his talks with DPRK leaders. 
  Carter said on Thursday: "My hope during this private visit 
is to discuss some of the important issues of the day with 
leaders of the area." 
  Carter has been active in resolving conflicts in Panama, 
Nicaragua and Sudan, among others.

  [Text] Washington, June 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today announced new sanctions against Haiti to intensify 
the pressure on its military leaders. 
  The new measures include a ban on commercial air traffic 
between the United States and Haiti and sanctions on financial 
transactions between the two countries. 
  Clinton said in a White House announcement that these two 
steps are necessary to intensify the pressure on the Haitian 
military leaders who drove elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide into exile in 1991. 
  "These steps represent an important new stage in our efforts 
to restore democracy and return President Aristide to Haiti," he 
said. 
  "The message is simple, democracy must be restored, the coup 
must not endure," Clinton stressed. 
  The new sanctions "have been endorsed by the Organization of 
American States, the friends of Haiti, and President Aristide," 
said William Gray, special adviser to the President on Haiti, at 
a White House briefing after Clinton's announcement. 
  "Through these actions, we are sending a strong message to 
Haiti's military leaders that they cannot continue repressing 
their people and defying world opinion with impunity," Gray said. 
  Asked if a military option on Haiti will be taken, Gray said 
that "All options are on the table. We are pursuing a 
multilateral policy with our allies in the region." 
  He also said that "We will continue to work in a 
multilateral 
way to apply the maximum amount of pressure and to use every 
option available to restore democracy."

  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jun (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, State 
Council vice premier and foreign minister, met today at the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, who is now on a working visit to China. Qian Qichen 
and Kakizawa exchanged views on bilateral relations and on the 
issue of the Korean peninsula's nuclear problem. 
  Foreign Minister Kakizawa briefed Qian Qichen on Japan's 
views concerning the current situation. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out concerning the Korean peninsula's 
nuclear issue that the Chinese Government has always persisted 
in the basic goals of promoting a nuclear-free Korean peninsula 
and of maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula. 
Because these two goals are in accord with the fundamental 
interests of all the countries of Northeast Asia, they should 
become the basic starting point for seeking a proper solution to 
the current problem. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out that China is greatly concerned 
about 
the serious difficulties surrounding the Korean peninsula's 
nuclear issue. We regret the action taken by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency on 10 June to temporarily halt technical 
assistance to [North] Korea and the consequences resulting from 
that action. When faced with difficulties, it is particularly 
necessary for the parties concerned to maintain calm and to 
exercise restraint, not to simply close the door to dialogue, 
and to do everything possible to leave room to maneuver and to 
maintain the possibility of solving this problem through 
dialogue. Sanctions will not help to solve problems and can 
only sharpen contradictions and might lead to consequences that 
no one wants to see. We call on the parties concerned to try 
their best to start up the dialogue, to alleviate the 
contradictions, and to seek ways for a proper solution to the 
problem.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa met with Chinese 
counterpart Qian Qichen in Beijing this afternoon, and discussed 
North Korea's alleged nuclear development. In the meeting, 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen noted that China is calling for 
North Korea's self-restraint from fruitless military conflicts, 
stressing that concerned nations should seek a settlement of the 
problem through consultations to the end. 
  The Japan-China foreign ministerial meeting was held at the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for over two hours. In the meeting, 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa expressed great expectations for 
China's role in the North Korean issue, asking it to persuade 
North Korea to reopen dialogue with the international community. 
  On that ground, Foreign Minister Kakizawa requested China 
not 
to use its veto when the UN Security Council [UNSC] discusses 
sanctions against North Korea, noting China's positive role is 
very important in the UN process to determine its stance, 
including sanctions. 
  In response, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that the 
Chinese Government is greatly concerned over the present 
circumstances of the problem. 
  [Begin recording of reporter Tadanobu Sakamoto in Beijing] 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed the Chinese 
Government's great concern over the present circumstances of the 
North Korean nuclear issue. He then clarified that China is 
trying its best to persuade North Korea to refrain from 
fruitless military conflicts. On the other hand, he indirectly 
showed China's negative stance toward UN sanctions, saying 
sanctions cannot be effective right now and the issue should be 
settled through consultations to the end. 
  However, the Japanese delegation is paying attention to the 
fact that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen did not clearly say China 
would oppose UN sanctions because this is seemingly the first 
change in China's official stance toward the issue. 
  The Japanese Government views China may not use its veto 
when 
the UNSC is forced to impose sanctions against North Korea. 
Hereafter, the government intends to strengthen its approach to 
China in close cooperation with the United States and the ROK.

  [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen told his visiting Japanese counterpart Koji Kakizawa 
on Sunday [12 June] that U.N. sanctions on North Korea would be 
"ineffective," but that China is willing to play a "positive 
role" in seeking a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, a 
Japanese official said. 
  While the meeting of the two foreign ministers focused 
mainly 
on the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, Japan also 
condemned the underground nuclear test carried out by China last 
Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  "It is extremely regrettable that the People's Republic of 
China conducted another nuclear test. Japan has always regarded 
the nuclear test ban as one of the highest priorities in the 
field of disarmament and it strongly urges China not to repeat 
nuclear testing in the future," Kakizawa was quoted as saying. 
  On the North Korean nuclear issue, Qian said China "will 
participate positively in the discussions within the framework 
of the United Nations and is ready to play its own positive 
role," the spokesman said. 
  The Chinese foreign minister said applying sanctions to 
North 
Korea would be ineffective, judging from the fact that it has 
already been isolated and has little economic contact with the 
rest of the world, he said. 
  The spokesman refused to speculate on whether China would be 
willing to go along with U.N. Security Council sanctions under 
discussion, or whether it would veto such sanctions. 
  "We explained to our counterpart our view that the situation 
demands that the international community as a whole, through the 
United Nations Security Council, consider an appropriate 
response, including sanctions," he said. 
  "Our purpose is not to bring about punitive measures. 
Rather, our objective is that North Korea dispel the doubts of 
the international community over its nuclear development and it 
come back to the dialogue table," he said. 
  Kakizawa said Japan values highly the work China has already 
done on the issue and stressed the importance of China playing a 
"positive role within the framework of the U.N.," the spokesman 
said. 
  The two foreign ministers also discussed other issues of 
bilateral concern, including growing and increasingly 
"interdependent" economic and trade ties and China's entry into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said. 
  Kakizawa's one-day visit follows his talks with South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Undersecretary of State 
Peter Tarnoff, held Saturday in Seoul on the recent developments 
of the North Korean nuclear issue

  [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa suggested Sunday [12 June] China's fresh nuclear 
test could influence Tokyo's future loans to Beijing, Japanese 
officials said. 
  Kakizawa was quoted by a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
as telling his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that Japan has 
always regarded banning nuclear tests as one of the highest 
priorities in the field of disarmament and that it strongly 
urges China not to repeat nuclear testing in the future. 
  The Japanese foreign minister said Friday's nuclear test was 
also regrettable in light of the Japanese Government's 
guidelines, released in June 1992, which state that recipient 
countries of Japan's official development assistance (ODA) 
should promote disarmament, the spokesman said. 
  Kakizawa's remarks suggested that China's failure to stop 
nuclear tests may have a negative impact on Japan's yen loan 
programs from fiscal 1996 and thereafter, the official said. 
  Qian reiterated that China's nuclear tests are the fewest 
among those carried out by world nuclear powers, the spokesman 
said. 
  The Japanese minister was in Beijing mainly to discuss 
measures to cope with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development.

  [Text] Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks here this afternoon 
with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who arrived here 
today for a working visit. 
  They exchanged opinions on bilateral relations and nuclear 
issues on the Korean peninsula. 
  Kakizawa briefed Qian on Japan's views regarding the current 
situation. 
  Qian said that on the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, it is 
China's basic goal to promote denuclearization and maintain 
peace and stability in the region, which are in line with the 
fundamental interests of all the countries in Northeast Asia and 
should be the starting point of resolving the current problems. 
  Qian pointed out that at present serious concerns over the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula have arisen, for which 
China has much concern. "We express our regrets at the move 
taken by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) on June 10 to stop its technical assistance 
to the DPRK and the results brought about by the move," Qian 
said. 
  Facing the difficulties, Qian continued, parties concerned 
should keep calm, exercise restraint and not close the door of 
negotiation hastily, trying every means to leave room for 
solving the problem through dialogue. 
  Qian noted that sanctions, which would not help solve the 
problem, could only intensify the contradictions and even lead 
to results that all parties would not like to see. 
  "We appeal to the parties concerned to make efforts to open 
dialogue, mitigate contradictions and seek a way of settling the 
problem step by step," Qian said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, said here

resort to dialogue for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  During a meeting with Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff 
of the Korean People's Army, and his party this morning at the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Liu said that on the Korean 
peninsula nuclear issue, it is China's basic goal to promote 
denuclearization and maintain peace and stability in the region. 
  The people and armies of China and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) enjoyed profound friendship, Liu said, 
and such valuable friendship should be passed on from generation 
to generation. 
  He said he believed that the delegation's current visit to 
China would be helpful to promoting mutual understanding and 
friendship. 
  Choe, expressing his happiness to meet Liu again five years 
after their first meeting during Liu's DPRK visit, said he 
appreciated China's effort in developing friendship between DPRK 
and China.

that 
there would be more military exchanges between the two armies.

of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has visited Shanghai 
and Hangzhou.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, met with a Korean 
military delegation led by Choe Kwang, chief of the Korean 
People's Army General Staff, in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse 
this morning. Liu said during the meeting that China hopes that 
all the parties concerned will try every means to resort to 
dialogue to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Liu Huaqing said: As for the nuclear issue on the Korea 
peninsula, China always upholds the objective of promoting the 
denuclearization on the peninsula and safeguarding peace and 
stability on it. 
  He said: There is a profound friendship between the peoples 
and between the armies of China and the DPRK. Such a friendship 
is very precious and should be passed on from generation to 
generation. He expressed the belief that the visit to China by 
Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff, will certainly be 
conducive to promoting mutual understanding, friendship, and the 
development of bilateral relations. 
  Liu Huaqing visited the DPRK and met with Choe Kwang five 
years ago. Choe Kwang said that he was pleased to have the 
opportunity to meet with Liu Huaqing again and that he 
appreciated the efforts made by China to develop friendship 
between the DPRK and China.

willingness to increase exchanges between the two armies so as 
to promote the development of relations between the two armies 
and the two countries.

universities have enhanced intercollegiate cooperation and joint 
efforts with the public since the beginning of this year. 
  On May 21 this year, Nanjing University here signed an 
agreement to cooperate with China Pharmaceutical University in 
teaching, personnel training and academic exchanges. 
  Five universities in Beijing -- the University of 
International Business and Economics, Beijing Chemical 
Engineering Institute, Beijing University of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine, Beijing Institute of Clothing Technology and Beijing 
Institute of Finance -- recently agreed to open optional courses 
to each others' students, jointly tackle key academic projects, 
share research results, and jointly build student dormitories

  Several universities have even merged. On May 27, three 
universities and one college in Shanghai formed Shanghai 
University. 
  Five colleges in Yangzhou city in east China's Jiangsu 
Province became one and two universities in Sichuan Province 
followed suit. 
  Some local governments and enterprises have also joined the 
construction of universities and colleges. China Astronautics 
Industry Corporation and the Beijing Municipality have recently 
declared intentions to help run the Beijing University of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics. 
  Some large enterprises are willing to aid universities and 
colleges in exchange for help in training workers. 
  The public is in favor of the trend toward running schools 
jointly, regarding it as a new measure to deepen the reform.

and universities, saying that their cooperation will be 
beneficial in improving educational quality, making full use of 
resources and enhancing schools' vitality.

<F P=106> [By Luo Guanxing (5012 6034 2502), Central People's </F>
Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang 
(1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and Political Bureau 
Standing Committee, held a discussion meeting today with the 
comrades attending the ideological and political work conference 
of Central Committee organs. He emphasized during the meeting: 
The most fundamental task of ideological and political work 
during the new period is to educate the vast number of party 
members, cadres, and people in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To perform the 
task well conscientiously is the most important and effective 
way to strengthen and improve ideological and political work and 
to raise it to a higher level. 
  The meeting was held in the Huairen Hall at Zhongnanhai. 
Nearly 100 people attended. They included Wei Jianxing, member 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, 
and department heads and full-time party secretaries of Central 
Committee organs. 
  During the meeting, Tian Congming, Yang Xingfu, Cui Yuanxi, 
and Sun Guozhi, persons in charge of relevant organizations, 
gave reports on their organizations' ideological and political 
work. 
  After hearing their reports, Hu Jintao pointed out: To build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the common aspiration 
of the people across the country and it is a task in the 
people's fundamental interest. To accomplish it, we must rely 
on the people across the country to display a pioneering spirit 
and work hard in unity. We should now effectively seize 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, 
maintain statability, and continue to advance toward the 
splendid goal. Fundamentally speaking, to do so, we must rely 
on the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line, on the strong party leadership, and on effective 
ideological and political work to arouse to the maximum extent 
the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of people and to fully 
bring into play their wisdom and talents. Ideological and 
political work is our party's fine tradition and political 
superiority. During the historical period of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and during the present course of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, we must take 
a further step to carry forward the tradition and give play to 
the superiority. We must not weaken the tradition and 
superiority even a little bit. 
  Hu Jintao said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always attached 
great importance to ideological and political work. He has made 
a series of expositions on the new period's ideological and 
political work, which are the important contents of the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and are a 
correct guidance for us to do ideological and political work 
well in the new period. He has set a brilliant example for the 
whole party in attaching great importance to ideological and 
political work and in earnestly doing the work himself. We 
should seriously study and understand Comrade Xiaoping's 
expositions on ideological and political work and 
conscientiously strengthen and improve ideological and political 
work under the new situation. 
  Hu Jintao emphasized: To arm the whole party with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a longterm strategic task. We should proceed 
from the characteristics of the organs under the Central 
Committee to guide the masses into considering the new situation 
and new tasks and adhering to the principle of integrating 
theory with practice. Efforts should be made to study theories 
and major practical problems thoroughly and to apply what has 
been studied. As a result of the study, we should enhance our 
understanding of ideological theories and policies, improve our 
political quality, and make the organs under the Central 
Committee play an even better role in serving the central 
authorities, the grass-roots units and the people, and in 
serving reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
  Hu Jintao pointed out: An important principle during the new 
period is to do ideological and political work; implement the 
party's basic line, principles, and policies; and accomplish the 
party's central task simultaneously. The task of strengthening 
and improving ideological and political work must be done in 
conjunction with the general task of the whole party and the 
whole country -- to "seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain statability." This is 
a new demand set by the new situation and new tasks, a test for 
party and government organs in ideological and political work, 
and also an opportunity for them to further strengthen and 
improve their ideological and political work. We should seize 
the good opportunity to step up ideological education and 
ideological guidance in light of new realities and to remarkably 
improve ideological and political work. 
  Hu Jintao said: A party or government organ's ideological 
and political work is linked to its party building work. When 
the party organizations at all levels in the organ become 
stronger, have a greater fighting power, and fully display the 
party's superiority, they will promote the organ's ideological 
and political work, as well as its other undertakings. 
  We 
should continue to properly improve leading bodies' ideology and 
work style. While holding democratic meetings regularly, we 
should uphold and improve democratic centralism. It is also 
necessary to persistently manage the party strictly and to 
continually improve the contingent of party members' quality. 
Communist party members in Central Committee organs should 
continually undergo tests to strengthen their party spirit. At 
their respective posts and while conducting various organ 
activities, they should be models who resolutely implement the 
party's basic line and its various general and specific 
policies, and who safeguard and enhance the party's overall work 
across China. They should be models who wholeheartedly serve 
the people, who foster close ties with the masses, and who 
conscientiously safeguard the masses' interests. Furthermore, 
they should be models who do arduous and pioneering work; who 
honestly and diligently administer; and who conscientiously 
resist money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism. In 
addition, they should be models who study hard and who are 
practical and creative. 
  Hu Jintao pointed out at the end: Leadership is the key to 
intensifying and improving ideological and political work. 
Major leading comrades in various departments in Central 
Committee organs should take the lead in paying close attention 
in this regard, should earnestly practice what they advocate, 
and should realistically strengthen their leadership over 
ideological and political work in their units. Various units 
should include ideological and political work in their work 
schemes and agenda, and should thoroughly study, examine, and 
supervise the work. Party organizations in the organs should be 
responsible for properly and regularly conducting ideological 
and political work, and should actively and effective promote 
ideological and political work through various activities. 
Leading comrades in various organs and party organizations 
should pay full attention to cultivating the growth of the 
cadres contingent who handle political work. Comrades who 
handle ideological and political work should further strengthen 
their sense of responsibility; should continually promote the 
spirit of making selfless sacrifices and actively forging ahead; 
and should cautiously, conscientiously, and properly perform 
their work so as to further propel departments' tasks to 
progress to a higher level. 
  Also attending the meeting were comrades in charge of 
various 
units in Central Committee organs including Gu Yunfei, Li 
Shuzheng, Wang Jialiu, Pang Xianzhi, Shao Huaze, Guo Chaoren, 
Sun Jiazheng, and Li Keqiang.

<F P=106> [By Chen Chieh-hung (7115 3381 1738): "Deng Xiaoping Is </F>
Opposed To Erecting Statues and Building Memorial Halls for 
Himself"] 
  [Text] According to a source in Beijing, in a letter to 
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and in a talk 
with members of the central Secretariat in mid-April, Deng 
Xiaoping solemnly indicated his disapproval of the practice of 
raising his image to an excessively high level. 
  In his letter to the Political Bureau, Deng said: I recently 
learned that party and government departments, units, 
enterprises, and schools in some localities wanted to erect 
statues of me, cast badges of me, repair my former residence, 
and build memorial halls for me. This is an indication of the 
respect and solicitude which the party and the people have for 
me, and I am deeply moved by and gratified for this, but I also 
feel deeply uneasy. It is hoped that the central and local 
authorities will do a good job of persuading them not to erect 
statues of me, repair my former residence, or building memorial 
halls for me, and I extend sincere tribute and gratitude for 
this. 
  In a talk with members of the Secretariat, Deng said: I hope 
you will not raise me to an excessively high level in publicity. 
May I suggest that the Secretariat issue a circular, calling on 
people not to erect statues of me or build memorial halls for 
me. Even after I go, this should still be upheld. Shaoqi [Liu 
Shaoqi], the Premier [Zhou Enlai], Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and I 
raised the issue of opposing the personality cult at the Eighth 
CPC National Congress. At that time it was aimed at countering 
the personality cult starting to develop around Mao Zedong, but 
it was not upheld later and it led to the feverish cult for Mao 
Zedong and brought grave misfortunes to the party and the 
people. This state of affairs was basically curbed after the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Some 
time ago, some people in the party suggested hanging the 
portraits of present leaders. Comrade Zemin [Jiang Zemin] was 
opposed to this, and I supported him. It is right to hang the 
portraits of present leaders, but it is better not to. In 1980 
the central Secretariat made a decision against hanging the 
portraits of leaders for the next 20-30 years in an effort to 
eliminate blind worship and superstitions concerning any one 
individual. 
  Deng added: Of course, it will not do for a state or a 
political party not to have a program or a theory guiding its 
practice. The party's and state's theory of construction and 
development should be the crystallization of collective wisdom, 
which has stood the test of practice. These theories still have 
to be constantly substantiated, improved, and revised along with 
the progress of the times and the development of the state. One 
or several individuals may play a substantial, or even a crucial 
role at a certain stage or period. Nevertheless, one or several 
individuals belong to the party and the people, and therefore it 
is inadvisable to publicize any one individual to an excessively 
high level. True, some of my viewpoints differ from, and may 
even be antagonistic to Marxism. Some people in the outside 
world and in the party label me a "revisionist," and even a 
"traitor" to Marxism. Talking about revisionism, it is 
necessary to see in which direction it is "revised." If, after 
revision, the line, principles, and policies can push forward 
and accelerate state development and progress, enrich the 
people, and improve their living standard, then we should 
continue walking along this line. The most fundamental and 
important task of a political party governing on behalf of the 
people is to enhance the state's comprehensive national power 
and to improve the people's living standard. If we fail to do 
so, what right do we have to govern on behalf of the people? 
  Deng added: From now until the end of this century, it is 
still necessary to give more publicity to the line of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the 
resolution of the 14th party congress, and the leading 
collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core. In the last five years, there has been 
another substantial change in the country which finds 
concentrated expression in the firm and strong leadership of the 
present leading body. This is the result of implementing a 
correct line, a fact that all people without prejudice will 
admit. 
  The source said that Deng Xiaoping indicated explicitly that 
he should not have conferred on him such titles as honorary 
state president, honorary chairman of the military commission, 
honorary chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, and so on, because this would put him in an awkward 
position.

<F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by staff reporter: "Chen Ziming </F>
Suffers From All Kinds of Diseases and Ailments, Must Seek 
Permission Before Going Out"] 
  [Text] Wang Zhihong, wife of famous mainland dissident 
Chen Ziming, expressed a sense of relief over her husband's 
return home on 8 June, but she also expressed deep concern over 
the diseases her husband contracted in jail over past years. At 
present, Chen Ziming must ask for permission from the 
authorities concerned if he wants to go out. 
  Wang Zhihong yesterday accompanied her husband back to their 
home in Beijing. Unlike before, their home was surrounded by 
more than 10 uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Wang Zhihong 
said that the present situation of her husband and herself was 
delicate. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Chen Ziming's mother returned from her 
son's place. She was deeply worried about her son's health, and 
asked -- since her son had been allowed to seek medical 
treatment outside prison -- why the authorities still did not 
allow him to go out freely. 
  Chen Ziming is now suffering from heart disease, stomach 
disease, high blood pressure (100-160), and skin disease. 
According to his wife, except for the skin disease, all the 
diseases were contracted in prison. The greatest hope of Wang 
Zhihong is that her husband's diseases will be cured. 
  Chen Ziming is now living with his family, but he still 
cannot go out and return to society freely. Wang Zhihong was 
discontent with the fact that her husband had to "ask for 
permission from the authorities beforehand" if he wanted to go 
out. She is now negotiating with the authorities in a bid to 
achieve her husband's freedom. 
  After living in prison for five years, Chen Ziming lost some 
weight, but he was not dejected at having contracted many 
diseases. Wang Zhihong said that her husband was in a good 
mental condition and that the heavy mental pressure was 
mitigated. "However, the first thing now is to give him medical 
treatment." Wang also said that they were still facing the 
pressure from the authorities concerned. 
  Wang Zhihong, who spoke prudently, said that in the current 
sensitive period, it was inconvenient for Chen Ziming to say 
anything, but she hoped to express their thanks to overseas 
readers through this newspaper for their loving care. 
  It has been learned that after returning home, Chen Ziming 
continued to be under full surveillance by the authorities and 
could not come into contact with the outside world. In 
addition, his family was short of money, and they are concerned 
over their future livelihood. It is said that Chen's mother has 
formally expressed this concern to the authorities.

  [Text] In an apparent move to slow the pace of reforms 
amid increasing social and economic instability, China's 
Communist Party chief and State President Jiang Zemin has called 
for caution in economic restructuring. A reform package would 
be introduced only when it would benefit the overall interest of 
the general public, Mr Jiang, was recently quoted as saying. It 
would be put in place only when the overall economy and society 
could stand for it, Mr Jiang added. Mr Jiang appeared to be 
more reserved than other leaders about the reforms. 
  Chinese sources said the leader's remarks were revealed by 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua during an important speech to senior 
economic officials at a national meeting on price in Beijing 
earlier this month. Mr Zou said the remark by the party boss 
was the consensus of all senior leaders' views and should act as 
a guideline for future economic reforms. The guideline, 
initiated by Mr Jiang, was also discussed and agreed by the 
party politburo at a recent meeting, a Chinese economic source 
quoted the vice-premier as telling senior economic officials 
from central ministries and provincial authorities. 
  China analysts and economists said the remarks were 
tantamount to ruling out any radical reforms, apparently 
highlighting the increasing concern among senior leaders with 
projected reform packages. 
  Despite this leaders have been cautious about pushing 
forward 
reform packages, many of which were worked out late last year 
and expected to be put in place either this year or next, they 
appear to be striking what they call a "balance among growth, 
reforms and social stability". [sentence as published] 
  "Now, Mr Jiang apparently rules out the possibility in 
pushing forward those more sensitive reforms as they could have 
by and large some impact on the economics and society," a Hong 
Kong-based mainland economist said. 
  Mr Jiang said that as political and economic situations were 
much more complicated than a decade ago, they required officials 
responsible for reforms and the economy to be much more 
cautious. Mr Jiang added that although reform packages could be 
introduced, they should be implemented step-by-step. However, 
officials should watch the implementation of reform policy 
closely and review the situation and the effectiveness regularly 
after it was introduced, Mr Jiang said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Shutang (1728 0647 1016)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Supreme People's 
Court today held a telephone conference to sum up achievements 
attained during an earlier period in cracking down on economic 
crimes and to make arrangements for further promoting the work 
of hearing and adjudication major and serious cases of economic 
crime by various people's courts so as to continue successfully 
the anticorruption struggle. 
  Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, 
presided over today's meeting. Liu Jiachen, vice president of 
the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the conference. He pointed 
out: People's courts throughout the country have centered their 
efforts on trying and adjudicating major and serious cases of 
economic crime in the struggle against corruption, and the 
overall situation is satisfactory. People's courts at various 
levels have followed the guidelines of the party Central 
Committee and the work arrangements of the Supreme People's 
Court, have concentrated their efforts on quickly trying and 
adjudicating a large number of major and serious cases of 
economic crime, have heavily punished serious law offenders in 
accordance with the law, and have attained significant results 
in promoting and deepening the anticorruption struggle. 
  According to a statistical report, the cases of economic 
crimes heard and adjudicated by people's courts in 1993 involved 
152 cadres at and above the department level, including eight 
cadres at the bureau level and one cadre at the vice minister 
level. 
  Liu Jiachen pointed out: We should soberly understand that 
the results achieved so far still cannot meet the demands of the 
party and the people and the requirements in the current 
anticorruption struggle. There are still some problems in the 
trials of major and serious economic cases which must not be 
overlooked. He said: In the next phase, people's courts 
throughout the country will have a heavier task in hearing and 
adjudicating major and serious cases of economic crime. 
Therefore, leading cadres of people's courts at various levels 
must personally take charge of the work and have the courage to 
resist all interference and obstacles in the trials of various 
cases. We must adhere to principles, rely on the party's 
leadership, and ensure the proper trial of various cases. We 
should handle various cases in a prompt manner with high quality 
and efficiency. We should establish a sound working system and 
guarantee the smooth flow of information. We should strengthen 
propaganda and increase the results in handing cases. 
  At the telephone conference, Liu Jiachen also explained the 
specific arrangements made by the Supreme People's Court for the 
trial of major and serious cases of economic crime in the next 
phase. He said: The Supreme People's Court, based on its 
understanding of major and serious cases of economic crime being 
handled at present, will promptly announce the results of trying 
those cases throughout the country in the next few months.

"China's Aviation Industry Badly Needs Import of Modern 
Management System"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 10 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The cause 
of the 6 June Xian plane crash is still under investigation. 
The Russian airplane manufacturer will send personnel to assist 
in the analysis. The plane crash, the most serious incident in 
China's civil aviation history, shows once again the serious 
problems in China's civil aviation safety. In order to quickly 
reverse the situation, the solution is not merely to purchase 
several more advanced planes from abroad, but more importantly 
to vigorously import the management system of the modern 
aviation industry to enable the quality of personnel and 
management levels to catch up with the speedily developing civil 
aviation industry. 
  State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua recently urged the 
management of China's civil aviation to draw a lesson from the 
air crash and to adopt more measures to step up security. In 
fact, the authorities' determination to step up aviation 
security is seen from the placement of new heads of the Civil 
Aviation General Administration at the end of last year and the 
upgrading of the General Administration from the vice 
ministerial level to the ministerial level. Moreover, the new 
personnel really have had new performance, which includes the 
promulgation of a series of regulations on air traffic 
management and several measures to upgrade services and 
safeguard the safety of civil aviation. Early this month, they 
held many meetings at which they stressed the paramount 
importance of "strict control." 
  Despite this, records of civil aviation safety are still 
worrying. In May, there were 17 incidents, which were followed 
by a plane explosion in the air. What were the reasons for the 
frequent incidents? According to an analysis by a senior 
official of China Northwest Airline, one of the main factors 
were that the civil aviation industry is developing too quickly 
and the corresponding technology, equipment, personnel, and 
management cannot catch up. In recent years, passenger volume of 
China's civil aviation has continuously increased at a rate of 
25 to 30 percent each year and several dozen local airlines have 
been newly set up. There is no denying that the delegation of 
executive powers and the increasing purchase of new airplanes 
from abroad help meet the huge need of the aviation market. But 
for the civil aviation industry, a special industry that gives 
priority to safety, introducing modern management concepts and 
systems and hiring overseas management and technical personnel 
in the field are important and must not be delayed. 
  China has already placed a record-breaking order for new 
American passenger planes to replace old models. But the 
immediate task is that it should, beginning with the management 
system, make great efforts with regard to personnel, training, 
maintenance, supervision, control, and logistics to ensure that 
regulations are implemented.

<F P=106> [Report: "Assault on Disc Pirates Picks Up Momentum"] </F>
  [Text] The momentum is gaining in the nationwide fight 
against pirated compact and laser discs, which should further 
tighten copyright protection across the country. 
  The crackdown, launched in mid-April, was intended to check 
the flow of illegal CDs and LDs and restore order to China's 
audio-visual market, which is plagued by piracy and bogus 
products. 
  The battle is particularly gaining ground in Beijing, 
Jiangsu 
and Guangdong provinces, according to Chinese reports. 
  Investigators have found that most Chinese audio-visual 
publishing houses, record stores, show rooms and night clubs 
follow the law, while a small portion seek illicit ways to gain 
quick profits. 
  In Beijing, police launched an attack last week in the 
entertainment market. They smashed three stores which sell 
pirated or smuggled goods, confiscated 1,607 LDs and 125 CDs in 
addition to 1,480 cassettes and tapes, the Beijing Daily 
reported on Friday. 
  Currently, the city has 120 audio-visual publishing houses, 
1,000 record shops, 400 show rooms and 500 night clubs. 
  Meanwhile, in East China's Jiangsu Province, fake discs also 
have been the main prey of investigators from publication 
administrations since early this year, the Press and Publication 
Journal reported on Friday. 
  Their first target was two LD factories in Jiangsu. 
  One of the plants was found violating copyright law and was 
fined 200,000 yuan ($23,000). 
  To add to the attack, investigators in the provincial 
capital 
of Nanjing have conducted six secret checks on the audio-visual 
market. 
  They confiscated more than 5,000 smuggled and pirated discs. 
  In Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other cities, the 
investigators also seized more than 15,000 copies. 
  With the attack, audio-visual markets in the province are 
taking on a new look, the journal said. 
  Furthermore, the journal added, Guangdong authorities have 
also targeted CD and LD smugglers during the past two months. 
  In addition to confiscating discs, they also closed down 
some 
unlicensed shopping stands. 
  Along with the nationwide attack, research from the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences suggested three ways to stem illegal 
pirating, the BEIJING DAILY reported.

<F P=106> [By Lu Jen (7627 0086)] </F>
  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, top CPC leaders 
have pointed out on various occasions that the year 1994 is 
crucial for China's reform and development, stressing that the 
situation brooks no undue optimism. In a speech made at 
the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission held in late February this year, CPC General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin clearly stressed the need to develop a 
"sense of crisis." Jiang's speech was so abridged that the 
term "sense of crisis" and relevant content disappeared when 
published by the news media, but the essentials of the speech 
remained unchanged. 
<H5>  Jiang Spoke About the Reasons for Developing a Sense of </H5>
Crisis 
  In August last year, Jiang spoke about combating corruption 
at the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, concentrating on making preparations for an 
anti-corruption campaign. In a speech at the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission meeting in late February this year, 
however, he mentioned the anti-corruption campaign in a more 
serious manner and made a grimmer estimation of the situation. 
  In appraising the anti-corruption campaign last year, Jiang 
said: "Corruption does exist in our party and government 
departments and it continues to spread in some areas." "If we 
treat the problem lightly and allow the malpractice to go 
unchecked, our party, the people's political power, and our 
socialist modernization drive will be doomed." Based on the 
findings and prosecutions over the last six months, Jiang 
admitted the problem was serious. "Corruption has penetrated 
into many areas of our social life," "the crimes of abusing 
power for personal gain and of perverting justice for bribes 
have reached an appalling point." 
  After advancing nine specific opinions on combating 
corruption, Jiang dwelt on the CPC's future. He pointed out 
that the CPC would fall from power if it failed to make 
achievements in promoting economic development or to hold 
corruption in check despite its success in economic construction. 
  A source said the seriousness of a great number of 
problems exposed by the anti-corruption campaign since last year 
was well beyond the CPC hierarchy's expectations. This is one 
of the reasons Jiang stressed the need to develop a sense of 
crisis, the source added. 
  Aside from this, Jiang also mentioned other problems which 
he 
said could not be underestimated. 
  The Clinton administration's policy toward China aims at 
achieving the same political evolution as that in the former 
Soviet Union so that the CPC will step down and China will 
become a dependency of Western countries. But Jiang maintained 
that recent developments in Russia had not followed the course 
expected by the West. The United States makes use of China's 
human rights to find fault in a bid to achieve something through 
pro-democracy activists. These pro-democracy activists are not 
dangerous; so long as our comrades keep in step with the party 
Central Committee politically, we can remove certain 
destabilizing factors in time. As disclosed by Jiang, a certain 
number of rather high-ranking leading cadres fail to keep in 
step with the party Central Committee politically. Jiang warned: 
We are clearly aware of this. Never suppose that we are in the 
dark. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji Said "Approval Procedures Give Rise to Corruption" </H5>
  Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau standing committee and vice premier, has spoken about 
corruption in the economic field on many occasions since the 
beginning of this year. 
  Zhu pointed out: Abuse of approval rights is a major 
reason for corruption. Many people believed that Zhu's remark 
referred to the serious and hardly suppressible corruption in 
the economic field. China has not separated politics from 
economics for a long time. Efforts have been made over the last 
few years to separate the two, but with little success. The 
functions of the administrative department have been basically 
separated from those of enterprises in form, but various 
approval procedures makes it possible for the administrative 
department to rule the roost, subjecting enterprises to its 
control. The fact that the administrative department requires 
enterprises to apply for approval before they can go ahead with 
their plans can only serve to prevent enterprises from 
exercising their right to make their own management decisions, 
thus leading to corruption. This is because such a 
practise will allow power to be traded for money. 
  Zhu said while telling cadres in the administrative 
department to correctly exercise their approval rights in the 
public interest, we must simplify approval procedures. The 
reform is aimed at lifting restrictions. This does not mean we 
should do away with the approval procedures, but we should 
minimize them. This is also essential to eliminating 
corruption, Zhu added. 
  When commenting on China's property development, Zhu 
called for early introduction of the system of appraising land 
prices. We should appraise land prices on a scientific basis 
and enlist the assistance of experts to act according to 
economic laws, Zhu continued. Zhu pointed out that the right of 
government officials to fix land price is also a cause of 
corruption. 
<H5>  Serious Inflation Brings High Pressure To Bear on Top CPC </H5>
Leadership 
  China's excessive inflation, which constitutes a serious 
problem, has applied high pressure to the CPC hierarchy. In his 
1994 government work report to the NPC, Li Peng proposed to keep 
the 1994 growth rate of retail prices below 10 percent. 
Developments in the first quarter, however, indicate it will be 
difficult to attain this intended goal. 
  According to the statistics released by the State 
Statistical 
Bureau, the economic growth rate has dropped to 9 or 10 percent 
in the first quarter of this year, but the inflation rate has 
continued to surge. Nationwide retail prices increased by 21 
percent over the same time last year. The inflation rate was 13 
percent nationwide last year. In June last year when 
macro-controls were put into effect, the growth rate of retail 
prices was only 12.5 percent. 
  China's present inflation bears two unprecedented features. 
One, inflation is found in both urban and rural 
areas. In the past, prices climbed in major and medium 
cities, but they remained relatively stable in the countryside. 
However, the countryside registers a two-digit inflation rate 
now. Two, both old and young suffer from inflation. 
In the past, only prices of consumption goods and charges for 
services not essential to daily lives were affected, but people 
have to pay more for the services and items of everyday use now. 
The CPC hierarchy has realized that if the situation worsens, 
economic order will be jeopardized and a large number of social 
problems will follow. 
  The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are said to 
have held several meetings after national conferences of the NPC 
and the CPPCC National Committee to study the current economic 
situation. They have decided to control the total volume of 
credit and of fixed assets investment to curb inflation and, at 
the same time, to increase the deposit rate in compensation for 
the people's losses incurred by the inflation. This 
notwithstanding, the possibility of a galloping inflation cannot 
be ignored. 
<H5>  Presevation of Political and Economic Stability Is of </H5>
Paramount Importance 
  In light of the present situation, the CPC has focused 
on maintaining political and economic stability this year in 
implementing the principle of "reform, development, and 
stability." Many economic reform measures which were to be 
introduced this year have been put off. In the political field, 
the CPC will conduct positive ideological education and take 
strong measures against destabilizing factors to eliminate them 
in the bud.

<F P=106> [By Huang Zhiling: "AIDS Deserves Attention Today"] </F>
  [Text] Probably nine out of every 10 Chinese could not say 
precisely how the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, or AIDS, is spread. 
  In the eyes of most Chinese people, AIDS is mainly a 
foreigners' disease. 
  But a report for the Chinese Government has warned that AIDS 
could be a serious problem. 
  The State Council Research Office report is based on 
research 
by the State Council and the ministry of Public Health which 
studied China's AIDS prevention and control programmes. 
  The world's first AIDS case was reported in the United 
States 
in 1981. 
  In the early 1990's, 400,000 patients around the world were 
diagnosed with AIDS. Nearly half of them were found in the 
United States. 
  Since the mid-1990's, however, the threat of AIDS has become 
of worldwide concern and it is now spreading especially fast in 
developing countries. 
  According to a conservative estimate by the World Health 
Organization, the world will have seen 50 million people 
infected by HIV by the year 2000. Most of these are expected to 
be in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 
  HIV is one of the viruses that causes AIDS. 
  China's first case of AIDS, in Beijing, was reported in June 
1985. The patient was an American tourist. 
  Since then, 1,361 cases of HIV infection have been reported 
in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; 1,106 
cases of HIV infection were found among mainland Chinese, the 
rest among foreigners and overseas Chinese. 
  Forty of the HIV carriers have developed AIDS, and 22 of 
them 
have died. 
  These figures were determined by a very small-scale testing 
operation among nearly 3 million people. 
  In China, the HIV virus has been spread mainly through the 
sharing of needles by intravenous drug users in Southwest 
China's Yunnan Province. More than 70 percent of China's AIDS 
cases reportedly come from Yunnan as a result of sharing needles. 
  However, in recent times, HIV infection from heterosexual 
contact is increasing faster than infection from sharing needles. 
  In 1991, 5.6 per cent of the HIV carriers were infected 
through sexual contact; in 1992, the figure was 13.8 per cent; 
and in 1993, 15.7 percent. 
  Outside Yunnan, most patients were found to have contracted 
HIV through sexual contact. 
  Before 1989, most HIV-carriers found in China were among 
foreigners. But since then, the number of Chinese infected with 
HIV has risen comparatively quickly. 
  The State Council report predicts that about 100,000 
mainland 
Chinese will be HIV-positive by the year 2000. The report 
predicts about 20,000 cases will have developed into full-blown 
AIDS. 
  The World Health Organization predicts that by the end of 
this century the number of HIV infected people in China will be 
no less than the average for Asian countries as a whole. 
  If this happens, China will have a large number of 
HIV-infected people. The danger of this happening is quite 
feasible, according to the State Council report. 
  The 1992 World Health Conference predicted by 2002, southern 
Sahara in Africa would be the hardest-hit HIV-infected region in 
the world, as it was at the time of the report. 
  But towards the end of this decade, it will be Asia, home to 
50 per cent of the world's population, that will witness a sharp 
rise in the spread of HIV. Each year, the number of Asians 
becoming infected with HIV is expected to be greater than the 
number of new infections in Africa. 
  A survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive 
Medicine shows that nearly half of the students investigated in 
eight Shenyang colleges, in Liaoning Province, did not fully 
understand how HIV was spread. 
  Public ignorance over how HIV is spread makes large-scale 
infections possible, said the State Council report. 
  The increase in prostitution in China is expected to make 
sexual contact the most common factor in the spread of the 
infection, said the State Council report. 
  Police authorities are also concerned over the increase in 
drug use and, along with that, needle-sharing that can spread 
HIV. 
  What is worse, say officials, is that drug users tend to be 
promiscuous. Women drug users often become involved in 
prostitution to finance their drug habit. This undoubtedly 
accelerates the spread of HIV, said the report. 
  China is yet to test all of its blood donor samples for 
traces of HIV. 
  Medical equipment, if not disinfected carefully, can be the 
agent for spreading HlV. In some of China's rural hospitals, 
medical equipment is not carefully disinfected, said the State 
Council report. 
  People aged between 18 and 45 are considered to be at the 
highest risk of contracting HIV. About 80 per cent of HIV-cases 
in China now are people aged between 20 and 49. Because this 
age group represents a normally productive part of society, the 
report says, the burden on the Chinese economy could be great. 
  Average annual medical expenses for AIDS patients range from 
3,300 to 7,400 yuan ($381 to $855), which is half the average 
annual family income in China. 
  According to the report, some high-ranking officials show 
indifference to the potentially devastating threat of AIDS in 
China. 
  China now has only 1,000 or so HIV-infected people, they 
argue. Even if this number were to increase 20-fold, it would 
still represent just a tiny fraction of the nation's populace, 
they say. 
  Many ordinary people still think AIDS is just a foreigners' 
disease and, providing one doesn't become involved in 
prostitution, doesn't represent a real danger. Also, some 
prostitutes think they can avoid infection by avoiding foreign 
clients, said the report. 
  Public awareness about the threat is at a low level in 
China. 
  Each year, wide publicity is given to the AIDS issue around 
December 1, which is World AIDS Day. But for the rest of the 
year, the problem is often ignored. 
  To increase public awareness on the AIDS problem, the 
Chinese 
media need to provide free time and space for public education, 
said the report.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (XINHUA) -- A recent survey by the 
State Education Commission's relevant department shows that 
today's college students positively support the policy of reform 
and opening up and hope that the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system is accelerated; they have a strong sense 
of participation and study hard in schools; and endeavoring to 
become a useful person has become the order of the day. 
  The survey was conducted simultaneously in 57 schools of 
higher learning in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong, 
and Shaanxi. A total of 14,500 questionnaires were passed out 
and some 1,360 college students were interviewed and surveyed 
[figures as received]. 
  The results of the survey show that college students 
positively support reform and opening up, and are heartened by 
the remarkable changes in various aspects of the national life 
since the reform and opening up policy was implemented. Ninety 
percent of the students believe that reform and opening up have 
"enhanced the comprehensive national strength," "raised the 
people's living standards," "emancipated productive forces," and 
"ushered in the best era in political and economic development 
since the founding of the PRC." Nearly one-half of the students 
deem that the government's measures to "respect teachers, 
emphasize education, and improve the condition of intellectuals" 
have yielded some results. 
  Students are generally optimistic about the future of 
socialist market economic system, and they have a better 
understanding of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. The majority of students believe 
that China will "certainly succeed" or "encounter some twists 
and turns but will ultimately succeed" in establishing a 
socialist market economic system. Of the major events of 
interest to the students over the past year, a considerable 
number of them show an interest in the publication of Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. They believe 
that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is "Marxism of contemporary China" and "a 
relatively systematic theory." 
  Steady progress in the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system has sparked the students' enthusiasm to study. 
Compared with two years ago, they have a greater initiative and 
are more conscientious in study. Eighty-five percent of them 
say they are "more anxious than before to learn some practical 
knowledge." Today, the heated discussion on "going into 
business" among college students has cooled down, while the 
number of college graduates applying for postgraduate schools is 
on the rise. Most students, guided by society's demand, 
voluntarily adjust their subject of study in a bid to improve 
their qualification. 
  What are the outlook on life and value concepts among 
college 
students today? The survey shows that the mainstream of 
students tends to have a forward-looking and noble-minded 
personality. They take "ideals," "conviction," "knowledge," 
"friendship," and "justice" as their dictums and pledge to "work 
hard and in a pioneering spirit in all circumstances," and to 
"subordinate individual interests to national and collective 
interests." 
  During interviews and surveys, college students show a great 
interest in some major domestic and international issues. They 
are discontent with the "West's interference in China under the 
pretext of human rights issue" and hope that earnest efforts be 
made to correct unhealthy practices and eliminate corruption in 
the party and society. As far as Chinese education is 
concerned, they hope that the educational reform be accelerated; 
they are heartened by the importance attached to education by 
the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the entire 
society. It is understood that many of their constructive 
suggestions have been included in the agenda of educational 
departments and school administrators at various levels.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Ma Ling (7456 3781): "Li Ruihuan </F>
and Zhang Baifa -- Striking Similarities"] 
  [Text] The relationship between Zhang Baifa and Li Ruihuan 
was once the talk of the town. Some even acclaimed at their 
"predestined" relationship. 
  Zhang and Li had many similarities and some sounded a bit 
unimaginable. Both of them were born in the same year in 
peasant families in Xianghe County, Hebei. Zhang was only three 
months older than Li. They entered the Beijing No. 3 
Construction Company as apprentices in the same year. Li 
Ruihuan learned carpentry, while Zhang Baifa was a trainee in 
reinforced bar. Although they had not attended institutions of 
higher learning, both of them tackled major technological 
problems in the general technical competition. Li Ruihuan 
resolved the technical problem of enlargement, while Zhang Baifa 
resolved the problem of leaping over steel framework. Later, 
both organized shock brigades and became labor models. They 
also were promoted on the same day. They were interviewed by 
the same person, who talked about the same position. The only 
difference is that the position of assistant general manager was 
for different companies. 
  It is even more strange that: Their wives, who had the same 
name, were born on the same day and same month. Zhang Baifa 
said realistically: "As we were construction workers during 
those years, it was difficult to get girlfriends. Moreover, 
girls in the urban areas were not willing to marry construction 
workers. Some people even said ironically: You look like 
beggars at a distance, or construction workers closer up. For 
this reason, our wives all were from rural areas." 
Unexpectedly, they got wives from rural areas with such 
similarities. 
  Now their grandchildren have the same names and are of the 
same ages. In addition, they go to the same schools. None of 
this was intentionally prearranged. 
  It seems that the "predestined relationship" between Li 
Ruihuan and Zhang Baifa cannot be explained by common sense. 
  While talking about Li Ruihuan, however, Zhang Baifa could 
not help expressing his appreciation from the botton of his 
heart: "Li Ruihuan is very clever. Willing to learn and to 
summarize work, Li is always more impressive than others when 
speaking: No one remains unconvinced before him. In terms of 
learning, I am not his match. When he gives a lecture on 
philosophy at a university, the students are never sleepy. He 
is an eloquent speaker with a good memory. He is knowledgeable 
and argues well on almost any topic. I hold him in special 
regard. I like to joke casually with other people, but never 
with him."

<F P=106> [By Jiang Xianli (5592 7359 4409), director and </F>
editor-in-chief of HUNAN RIBAO: "Persistently Guide the People 
With Correct Publicity"] 
  [Text] This January, General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
emphatically pointed out at the National Conference on 
Propaganda and Ideological Work: "Our propaganda work must be 
aimed at arming the people with scientific theories, guiding the 
people with correct publicity, molding the people with noble 
spirits, encouraging the people with fine literature and art 
works, and at bringing up generations of well-educated and 
well-disciplined socialist new people who have high ideals and 
moral standards, thus providing a powerful ideological guarantee 
and opinion support for our great cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics." Comrade Jiang Zemin's remarks 
have not only pointed out the correct direction for the overall 
propaganda and ideological work but can also serve as a 
fundamental principle by which the press and media, including 
newspapers, radio, and television, can successfully keep a rein 
on the correct guidance of public opinion and persistently guide 
the people with correct publicity. 
  It must be admitted that during the great cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the press and media in 
China have done a great deal of work in persistently guiding our 
people with correct publicity, providing a powerful ideological 
guarantee and opinion support. Party newspapers and magazines, 
in particular, have played a guiding role in this regard. 
However, it does not mean that we have done a perfect job and 
that there is no need for any improvement in providing correct 
guidance for public opinion. As a matter of fact, if we study 
the current situation in China's press and publishing circles 
with a sober mind, we can bring to light many things we do not 
wish to see. Over recent years, some people have been fond of 
reporting "hot issues" and seeking novelties with a view to 
creating so-called "sensational effects"; others are obsessed 
with the desire for gain and have engaged in providing 
"compensated news coverage" regardless of the adverse social 
effects these might cause; insisting on everyone going their own 
way, some have made irresponsible comments and violated the 
discipline of news reporting and propaganda; others have run 
counter to the policies on religion, impaired the unity among 
different nationalities, and affected the overall situation of 
stability; yet others have lowered their ideological guard and 
neglected the principle of "using different yardsticks for 
domestic- and overseas- oriented reports," leading to leakages 
of state secrets; some are involved in spreading "noises" with a 
low taste, having lost the main melody; and others have taken a 
subjective and one-sided approach to problems, failed to conduct 
thoroughgoing investigations, and engaged in making arbitration 
by default. All these show clearly that some of our comrades 
have failed to acquire a correct understanding as to how to 
guide the people with correct publicity. Therefore, there is an 
urgent need for us to restudy the issue, so that we can deepen 
our understanding and enhance our consciousness in implementing 
the guidelines from the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference. 
  Public opinion comprises those comments and remarks made by 
the majority of people in certain social circles and can 
therefore be regarded as the biased views of the majority on a 
specific situation or issue. Since they are of an open nature, 
such tendentious opinions will produce a strong spiritual 
strength once they are combined with the masses of the people, 
the main body of public opinion. This spiritual strength is 
irreplaceable by any material forces. Therefore, people in all 
social circles attach great importance to public opinion: They 
consciously or unconsciously become the recipients of public 
opinion and even directly involve themselves in creating public 
opinion, thus becoming the main body of public opinion. In real 
life, those who are involved in making public opinion include 
not only common people and mass organizations but also cultural 
and educational departments, literature and art groups, 
propaganda and ideological departments, and the press and other 
media. All these main bodies of public opinion are operated by 
people who are conscious of their responsibilities and act 
either carefully or impetuously in pursuit of certain goals. 
These people, or bodies and parties which represent the 
interests of these people, belong to certain social strata, 
social bodies, and political groups; moreover, due to their 
different experiences in life, they take different approaches to 
and employ different methods for problems which confront them 
and will have different views and opinions on the same social 
issue. All these views and opinions need to be strongly 
expressed through different channels or in different forms; as a 
result, differences in public opinion begin to shape up. These 
public opinions are both the outcome of people's reasoning and 
the outbreak of their feelings. Judging by the tendentiousness 
of public opinion, it can be roughly divided into two major 
categories, namely correct and incorrect public opinion. The 
official newspapers of party committees at all levels, for their 
part, should play their role as mouthpieces for the party during 
their participation in creating public opinion, accurately 
propagate the party's policies and principles, and make vigorous 
efforts to spread correct opinions. When the guidance of public 
opinion is correct, our people can work with one heart and one 
mind in high spirits; otherwise, the consequences will be 
disastrous. Both positive and negative experiences tell us that 
it is of vital importance to persistently guide our people with 
correct publicity. 
  To successfully guide the people with correct publicity we 
should first differentiate between correct and incorrect public 
opinion. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: "By raising the 
requirement to persistently guide the people with correct 
publicity, we mean to create public opinion which is favorable 
to deepening reform and opening up, establishing a socialist 
market economic structure, and developing the productive forces 
of the society; favorable to strengthening the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the 
legal system; favorable to encouraging and arousing people to 
carry out hard struggle and open new paths in order to make our 
country strong, our people rich, and our society prosperous; 
favorable to helping people differentiate right from wrong, 
uphold the true, the good, and the beautiful, and resist the 
false, the bad, and the ugly; and favorable to bringing about 
national reunification and unity among all nationalities, giving 
our people a contented life, and maintaining social and 
political stability." It can thus be seen that all public 
opinion favorable to our work in the aforementioned fields can 
be regarded as correct; otherwise, it cannot rated as correct. 
  It is decided by the party spirit of party newspapers and 
magazines to keep rein on correct guidance for public opinion 
and to persistently guide the people with correct publicity. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "Party newspapers and 
magazines must give unconditional publicity to propositions by 
the party." Here, Comrade Deng Xiaoping placed stress on "must" 
and "unconditional." That is to say, party newspapers and 
magazines should, and "must," propagate propositions by the 
party and such propagation must be "unconditional." The word 
"must" means that we are not allowed to hesitate or waver on 
this issue and the word "unconditional," tells us not to take a 
negative attitude or bargain with the party. We must uphold the 
party spirit of party newspapers and magazines conscientiously, 
translate this spirit into our practical work, and permeate 
every report with this spirit. Only by so doing can we 
correctly propagate the party's theories, line, policies, and 
principles; reflect in a vivid way the great practice of the 
masses of the people; arouse all positive factors and turn 
negative factors into positive ones; unite all forces that can 
be united; and strive to fulfill the grand goal of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  It is a demand of the party's cause to keep a rein on 
correct 
guidance for public opinion and to persistently guide the people 
with correct publicity. Our mass media is a component part of 
the entire cause of the party. To give publicity to the party's 
propositions and fulfill the party's tasks, we must pay close 
attention to the work of the mass media. This is also decided 
by the roles of the press and other media. Comrade Mao Zedong 
once pointed out: "The reason why newspapers can play an 
important role is that they can most rapidly make accessible the 
party's program and line, principles and policies, and work 
tasks and methods to the masses on the most extensive scale." 
Therefore, making full use of and running newspapers properly 
is "an issue of great principled significance in the party's 
overall work which should not be belittled." The 
several-decade-long history of our party has clearly showed that 
our victories in both revolution and construction cannot be 
separated from the propaganda and ideological work or from the 
roles of the mass media. Today, China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive have entered a new development phase. 
During the course of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we face new situations, new tasks, and new 
practices which require us to give play to the media role of 
party newspapers all the more. For instance, under the present 
new situation wherein packaged measures on the structural reform 
of finance and taxation, banking, investment, and commodity 
prices have already been put into effect, we should not only 
take into consideration the overall situation from a high 
strategic plane, give in-depth publicity to the party's line, 
principles, and policies, and make every effort to enable the 
masses to understand and master them but also provide the masses 
with convincing explanations on the new reform measures in 
simple language. We should summarize, spread, commend, and 
disseminate new experiences created by the masses and commend 
advanced individuals who have emerged in the practice of reform; 
conduct in-depth studies and research on all new subjects and 
contradictions cropping up during the process of reform, making 
every effort to resolve them as soon as they show up; and, 
through opinion supervision, try our best to overcome and 
straighten passive tendencies in our social life. To promote 
the reform, opening up, and modernization drive, we must let 
China know more about the world and let the world acquire a 
better understanding of China. However, we cannot realize this 
goal if we fail to guide the people with correct publicity. All 
this has clearly shown that doing a good job in propaganda and 
publicity and providing the people with correct opinion guidance 
is the demand of reform and opening up and also a requirement of 
our party in its effort to lead the people of the whole country 
in carrying out the grand cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  It is the wish and demand of the masses of the people to 
keep a rein on correct guidance of public opinion and to 
persistently guide the people with correct publicity. Party 
newspapers should serve the people and socialism. Today, the 
people of the entire country are engaged in a drive for 
socialist modernization. This is a cause led by the party in 
which the people rely on their own strength and work for their 
own interests. themselves. Facing such a reality, our 
newspapers should understand that if they want to provide good 
services and become useful to this cause of the people and also 
to the socialist modernization drive, a primary condition is 
that they must provide the people with correct publicity which 
has a unifying force and can inspire people's spirits. This is 
a prerequisite for party newspapers to win the trust of the 
people. Marx once pointed out: "The trust of the people is the 
condition on which newspapers depend for existence. Without this 
condition, newspapers will be totally lifeless." (Volume I of 
The Collected Works of Marx and Engels, p 234) 
Therefore, to inject life into themselves, newspapers should 
provide publicity that can serve as the guidance for our society 
and a clarion call of our times. To this end, the press and 
media should act under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
well as the party's basic line; implement the spirits of the 
14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee in every field of endeavor; speed up the 
pace of building a socialist market economic structure; maintain 
a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic growth; 
safeguard the political stability; and bring about comprehensive 
social progress. Only by so doing can we ensure that the press 
and media adhere to a correct orientation. 
  It is also an objective requirement of the development of 
both the domestic and international situations to keep a rein on 
the correct guidance of public opinion and to persistently guide 
the people with correct publicity. Under the present domestic 
and international situations, which are favorable to our efforts 
to push forward reform and construction, it is beyond doubt that 
we should seize this favorable opportunity, provide our people 
with correct publicity, and guide the enthusiasm of hundreds of 
millions of people toward the grand cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. However, the cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is one which needs the 
efforts of hundreds of millions of people and which can only be 
accomplished through hard struggle for several generations. 
Therefore, to maintain the vitality of this cause pioneered by 
our party, and to ensure that there is no lack of successors to 
carry on the cause, the official newspapers of party committees, 
as part of the party's propaganda and ideological organs, must 
view the matter from a high strategic plane and ensure that the 
publicity they provide is aimed at "training and bringing up 
generations of well-educated and well-disciplined socialist new 
people who have high ideals and moral standards." Meanwhile, 
our press and other media should also undertake the task of 
using truth and facts to expose certain foreign hostile forces 
which are stepping up efforts to lay an opinion siege to and 
vilify the image of China by means of propagating capitalist 
outlooks on value, human rights, democracy, and freedom. All 
this tells us that it is a must for us to attach great 
significance to the press and media work from the high plane of 
the future and fate of socialism and to provide our people with 
correct publicity with a strong sense of dedication and a lofty 
sense of responsibility. We should center our efforts around 
the goal of bringing up new people with "four have's"; carry out 
among the masses of the people, especially among young people 
and children, ideological and ethical education that is focused 
on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; conduct education on 
building up the country through thrift and hard work, on 
occupational ethics and social morality, and on basic national 
conditions; and spread legal knowledge among the people. We 
must pay close attention to guiding people, especially young 
people and children, to establish correct ideals, beliefs, and 
outlooks on the world, life, and value; make every effort to 
oppose money worship, hedonism, pleasure-seeking, and 
out-and-out egoism; and resist the corrosive influence of 
decadent capitalist and feudalist ideologies. 
  The purpose in analyzing problems is to solve them. To 
persistently guide the people with correct publicity and realize 
the value of news during the course of adapting ourselves to the 
needs of the society, we must, in my opinion, handle the 
following relationships properly: 
  1. we should handle the relations between enlivening 
news reporting and keeping a rein on the correct orientation of 
public opinion./ It is an inherent requirement of the media to 
enliven news reporting because stereotyped news reports do not 
attract the attention of readers and will therefore prove 
lifeless. As a matter of fact, news reporting can also play a 
part in enlivening public opinion. This is because the 
objective reality is ever changing and it can present us with an 
infinite variety of fantastic phenomena; therefore, so long as 
we can catch these changes, make true reports, and "trace their 
sources, seek the truth, and find out the cause" (The 1979 
edition of "Correspondence During My Stay in Europe" by Zhou 
Enlai published by RENMIN RIBAO Publishing House, p 5), vivid 
news reports will appear in newspapers. 
  However, by urging 
people to enliven news reporting, we neither hope them to make 
so-called objective reports in an indiscriminate way; nor do we 
encourage them to report only "hot issues," hunt for novelty, 
and pursue so-called "sensational effects" in order to pander to 
the "novelty-seeking" tastes or the unhealthy mentalities of 
certain readers. What we mean by urging people to enliven news 
reporting is to encourage them to keep a rein on a correct 
orientation for public opinion and bring the new reporting more 
in line with the requirements of the party and the people for 
the fulfillment of the grand cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Because party newspapers speak on 
behalf of the party and the government and enjoy a high 
authoritativeness, the masses of the people regard the reports, 
articles, and comments carried by party newspapers as the views 
of and propositions by the party and the government; by the same 
token, foreign countries also keep close watch on the moves of 
our country by analyzing party newspapers. Under such 
circumstances, party newspapers should proceed from the 
fundamental interests of the party and the country; consciously 
act in unison with the party Central Committee politically; have 
a firm grasp of the party's basic line; provide their readers 
with news reports they love to read with a view to seeking unity 
of thinking among the whole party and the people of the entire 
country; and render better services for the reform, opening up, 
and modernization drive. To uphold the party's basic line and 
never waver for 100 years, we need to have a good grasp of 
opinion guidance and maintain the continuity and stability of 
the keynote of propaganda. In the light of changes in the real 
situation during different periods, party newspapers will make 
appropriate changes to the emphasis of propaganda and news 
reporting. However, the basic contents of propaganda will 
remain unchanged and no one is allowed to change at will such 
standard terms as the party's basic line, centering around 
economic construction, upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, 
persistently carrying out reform and opening up, maintaining 
social stability, strengthening the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization, reinforcing the building of democracy 
and the legal system, and opposing corruption and advocating a 
clean administration. We must see to it that efforts to 
propagate these contents should not be relaxed at one time and 
tightened at another time; instead, all these contents should be 
publicized in a thoroughgoing and sustained way. This year, our 
news reporting and propaganda work should be subordinate to and 
serve the overall situation of "seizing favorable opportunities, 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, stepping up development, 
and maintaining stability." To this end, we must provide 
accurate propaganda on reform measures and aim our news reports 
at different readers; when reporting sensitive issues, we should 
have a good sense of propriety, pay attention to the tactics we 
employ, and give reports which are favorable to reform, 
development, and stability; when reporting issues about whioch 
the masses are most concerned or doubtful, instead of evading 
problems, we should promptly give correct answers and 
explanations to the masses, provide them with a positive 
guidance, and tell them in explicit yet sensible terms which 
understandings are correct and which are one-sided or even 
incorrect. In short, we should integrate healthy contents with 
the highest possible perfection of manifestation and try our 
best to help party newspapers cultivate their own specific 
features and styles. 
  2. We must handle the relations between critical 
reporting and positive propaganda. Doing a good job in 
critical reporting and strengthening opinion supervision is a 
manifestation of the combativeness of news reporting and also 
one of its indispensable functions. By providing necessary 
critical reporting, party newspapers can help people tell the 
good from the bad and the right from the wrong through 
comparisons and evaluations, thus safeguarding the truth and 
promoting healthy tendencies. As a result, party newspapers can 
exert an influence on the progress and promote the 
transformation of things. Therefore, critical reporting is a 
weapon for guiding social opinion, a weapon that should not be 
discarded. It is just as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We 
should attach great importance to investigations into and 
studies of the social opinions and mentality of the masses, 
reflect the opinions and suggestions of the vast numbers of the 
masses in a positive manner, and strengthen our supervision over 
public opinion." However, we should and ought to rely mainly on 
positive propaganda when we try to provide opinion guidance. 
This is because the building of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics under the leadership of the party is an 
unprecedented cause and both the cause itself and the masses of 
the people who plunge themselves into the cause deserve 
commendation. During this historical process, the trend that 
the people create history always remains a healthy mainstream 
and the bright side always occupies a dominant position. Of 
course, it does not mean that we will stop exposing and 
criticizing things which should be exposed and criticized. What 
we should do is to make positive and constructive criticisms 
which are aimed at helping the party and government improve 
their work, solving practical problems, enhancing unity among 
the people, and maintaining social stability. 
  To 
successfully uphold the principle of relying mainly on positive 
propaganda, we need to center our work around the central task 
of economic construction at all times, guiding the enthusiasm 
and creativity of the masses toward the current campaign of 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, and promoting the 
socialist market economic development and also toward the 
fulfillment of all tasks in the modernization drive. We need to 
concentrate our major efforts on reflecting the reality that the 
socialist cause with Chinese characteristics is forging ahead 
and bringing about changes day after day and on enthusiastically 
eulogizing the noble spirit and glorious accomplishments of the 
masses of the people in transforming the world and creating a 
new life. To carry out the principle of relying mainly on 
positive propaganda, we should first master dialectics and avoid 
one- sidedness in propaganda and news reporting. In particular, 
we should refrain from "exaggerating things," for exaggeration 
of even good things will end up in adverse results or even 
create bias. Second, we need to enhance our propaganda and news 
reporting skills, improve the writing style and the literary 
grace of our reports, and try to "write on the impulse of our 
emotions," thus adding a greater appeal, inspiration, and 
convincing force to our news reports. 
  3. We should handle the relations between economic 
returns and social results. Under the conditions of the 
socialist market economy, party newspapers have not only the 
general attribute of commodities but also a special attribute 
not possessed by general material products. Party newspapers 
are used to satisfy the needs of the spiritual lives of the 
people. This feature of possessing two kinds of attributes 
requires party newspapers to attach a greater importance to 
social results while paying attention to economic returns. It 
stands to reason that organs running party newspapers should act 
in line with newspaper-running rules as well as the operational 
laws of the market; strictly separate reporters and editorial 
staff from those engaged in production and operations, allowing 
the latter to take charge of the economic operations of the 
newspaper industry; and see to it that party newspapers can 
enjoy a larger number of subscribers and a bigger distribution 
volume, lower production costs, and enhanced economic returns. 
However, the enhancement of economic returns must be based on 
social results. As an information carrier, newspapers should 
give expression to their value not mainly through their direct 
economic returns but through their social results, namely, 
through their role of giving a tremendous impetus to the 
development of social productive forces and to the comprehensive 
progress of society. To successfully realize the best social 
results in news reporting, party journalists are required to 
integrate the objective value of news with the demands of the 
party and the people, so that their news reports can not only 
satisfy the desire of society for information, thus realizing 
the value of news reporting, but also play the role of giving 
publicity to the will, aspirations, and requirements of the 
party and the people, realizing the propaganda value of news 
reporting. All one-sided concepts and moves which lay stress on 
one side to the neglect of the other are detrimental and might 
directly or indirectly hold up the realization of social results 
of news reporting. Over the past several years, certain news 
units have had a tendency to pursue economic returns 
one-sidedly, thus impairing the social results of news 
reporting. For example, proceeding from the interests of small 
units and bodies, certain units have violated the principle of 
providing true information by engaging in selling newspaper 
columns and in making "news reports for compensation"; as a 
result, such news reports have totally lost their true value to 
society. Driven by the desire for money and obsessed by 
"handsome rewards" offered by some localities and units, some 
reporters have brought out reports which are inconsistent with 
the policies and principles of the party; as a result, their 
reports have lost the glamor of their propaganda value. What is 
more, under the corrosive influence of individualism, egoism, 
and money worship, a handful of reporters and editors have gone 
so far as to violate political discipline and sell party and 
state secrets to people outside China, thus turning themselves 
into criminals. We should take warning from all these problems 
and phenomena. 
  4. We should handle the relations between bringing 
into play the key role of news units and arousing the enthusiasm 
of all sides. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Party 
newspapers, party magazines, state news agencies, as well as 
radio and television stations, should all actively propagate the 
propositions by the party, playing a key role in providing the 
people with correct publicity." This is not only a great 
expectation of the party on the press circles but also our due 
responsibility. We must exert our utmost efforts to propagate 
correct public opinion, persistently guide our people with 
correct publicity, and live up to the great expectations of the 
party on the press circles. To this end, we should continue to 
strengthen the building of the press contingent and bring up a 
large number of reporters and editors who are politically 
qualified, proficient in professional work, and honest and 
upright in their ways. This serves as an organizational 
guarantee to our efforts to bring into play the pillar role of 
the press contingent. Moreover, the work of persistently 
guiding the people with correct publicity is not only the 
business of the press circles but also a task of overall 
importance for the party on its entire propaganda and 
ideological front. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to 
further reinforce the party's leadership over public opinion and 
mobilize forces from all sides to care about, pay close 
attention to, support, and participate in the work of guiding 
our people with correct publicity. Only by so doing can we 
create a sound opinion environment for the cause of the reform, 
opening up, and modernization in which we are currently engaged.

<F P=106> [By Luo Guanxing (5012 6034 2502), Central People's </F>
Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang 
(1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and Political Bureau 
Standing Committee, held a discussion meeting today with the 
comrades attending the ideological and political work conference 
of Central Committee organs. He emphasized during the meeting: 
The most fundamental task of ideological and political work 
during the new period is to educate the vast number of party 
members, cadres, and people in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To perform the 
task well conscientiously is the most important and effective 
way to strengthen and improve ideological and political work and 
to raise it to a higher level. 
  The meeting was held in the Huairen Hall at Zhongnanhai. 
Nearly 100 people attended. They included Wei Jianxing, member 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat, 
and department heads and full-time party secretaries of Central 
Committee organs. 
  During the meeting, Tian Congming, Yang Xingfu, Cui Yuanxi, 
and Sun Guozhi, persons in charge of relevant organizations, 
gave reports on their organizations' ideological and political 
work. 
  After hearing their reports, Hu Jintao pointed out: To build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the common aspiration 
of the people across the country and it is a task in the 
people's fundamental interest. To accomplish it, we must rely 
on the people across the country to display a pioneering spirit 
and work hard in unity. We should now effectively seize 
opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, 
maintain statability, and continue to advance toward the 
splendid goal. Fundamentally speaking, to do so, we must rely 
on the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line, on the strong party leadership, and on effective 
ideological and political work to arouse to the maximum extent 
the enthusiasm of millions upon millions of people and to fully 
bring into play their wisdom and talents. Ideological and 
political work is our party's fine tradition and political 
superiority. During the historical period of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and during the present course of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, we must take 
a further step to carry forward the tradition and give play to 
the superiority. We must not weaken the tradition and 
superiority even a little bit. 
  Hu Jintao said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always attached 
great importance to ideological and political work. He has made 
a series of expositions on the new period's ideological and 
political work, which are the important contents of the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and are a 
correct guidance for us to do ideological and political work 
well in the new period. He has set a brilliant example for the 
whole party in attaching great importance to ideological and 
political work and in earnestly doing the work himself. We 
should seriously study and understand Comrade Xiaoping's 
expositions on ideological and political work and 
conscientiously strengthen and improve ideological and political 
work under the new situation. 
  Hu Jintao emphasized: To arm the whole party with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a longterm strategic task. We should proceed 
from the characteristics of the organs under the Central 
Committee to guide the masses into considering the new situation 
and new tasks and adhering to the principle of integrating 
theory with practice. Efforts should be made to study theories 
and major practical problems thoroughly and to apply what has 
been studied. As a result of the study, we should enhance our 
understanding of ideological theories and policies, improve our 
political quality, and make the organs under the Central 
Committee play an even better role in serving the central 
authorities, the grass-roots units and the people, and in 
serving reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
  Hu Jintao pointed out: An important principle during the new 
period is to do ideological and political work; implement the 
party's basic line, principles, and policies; and accomplish the 
party's central task simultaneously. The task of strengthening 
and improving ideological and political work must be done in 
conjunction with the general task of the whole party and the 
whole country -- to "seize opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain statability." This is 
a new demand set by the new situation and new tasks, a test for 
party and government organs in ideological and political work, 
and also an opportunity for them to further strengthen and 
improve their ideological and political work. We should seize 
the good opportunity to step up ideological education and 
ideological guidance in light of new realities and to remarkably 
improve ideological and political work. 
  Hu Jintao said: A party or government organ's ideological 
and political work is linked to its party building work. When 
the party organizations at all levels in the organ become 
stronger, have a greater fighting power, and fully display the 
party's superiority, they will promote the organ's ideological 
and political work, as well as its other undertakings. 
  We 
should continue to properly improve leading bodies' ideology and 
work style. While holding democratic meetings regularly, we 
should uphold and improve democratic centralism. It is also 
necessary to persistently manage the party strictly and to 
continually improve the contingent of party members' quality. 
Communist party members in Central Committee organs should 
continually undergo tests to strengthen their party spirit. At 
their respective posts and while conducting various organ 
activities, they should be models who resolutely implement the 
party's basic line and its various general and specific 
policies, and who safeguard and enhance the party's overall work 
across China. They should be models who wholeheartedly serve 
the people, who foster close ties with the masses, and who 
conscientiously safeguard the masses' interests. Furthermore, 
they should be models who do arduous and pioneering work; who 
honestly and diligently administer; and who conscientiously 
resist money worship, hedonism, and extreme individualism. In 
addition, they should be models who study hard and who are 
practical and creative. 
  Hu Jintao pointed out at the end: Leadership is the key to 
intensifying and improving ideological and political work. 
Major leading comrades in various departments in Central 
Committee organs should take the lead in paying close attention 
in this regard, should earnestly practice what they advocate, 
and should realistically strengthen their leadership over 
ideological and political work in their units. Various units 
should include ideological and political work in their work 
schemes and agenda, and should thoroughly study, examine, and 
supervise the work. Party organizations in the organs should be 
responsible for properly and regularly conducting ideological 
and political work, and should actively and effective promote 
ideological and political work through various activities. 
Leading comrades in various organs and party organizations 
should pay full attention to cultivating the growth of the 
cadres contingent who handle political work. Comrades who 
handle ideological and political work should further strengthen 
their sense of responsibility; should continually promote the 
spirit of making selfless sacrifices and actively forging ahead; 
and should cautiously, conscientiously, and properly perform 
their work so as to further propel departments' tasks to 
progress to a higher level. 
  Also attending the meeting were comrades in charge of 
various 
units in Central Committee organs including Gu Yunfei, Li 
Shuzheng, Wang Jialiu, Pang Xianzhi, Shao Huaze, Guo Chaoren, 
Sun Jiazheng, and Li Keqiang.

<F P=106> [By Chen Chieh-hung (7115 3381 1738): "Deng Xiaoping Is </F>
Opposed To Erecting Statues and Building Memorial Halls for 
Himself"] 
  [Text] According to a source in Beijing, in a letter to 
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and in a talk 
with members of the central Secretariat in mid-April, Deng 
Xiaoping solemnly indicated his disapproval of the practice of 
raising his image to an excessively high level. 
  In his letter to the Political Bureau, Deng said: I recently 
learned that party and government departments, units, 
enterprises, and schools in some localities wanted to erect 
statues of me, cast badges of me, repair my former residence, 
and build memorial halls for me. This is an indication of the 
respect and solicitude which the party and the people have for 
me, and I am deeply moved by and gratified for this, but I also 
feel deeply uneasy. It is hoped that the central and local 
authorities will do a good job of persuading them not to erect 
statues of me, repair my former residence, or building memorial 
halls for me, and I extend sincere tribute and gratitude for 
this. 
  In a talk with members of the Secretariat, Deng said: I hope 
you will not raise me to an excessively high level in publicity. 
May I suggest that the Secretariat issue a circular, calling on 
people not to erect statues of me or build memorial halls for 
me. Even after I go, this should still be upheld. Shaoqi [Liu 
Shaoqi], the Premier [Zhou Enlai], Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and I 
raised the issue of opposing the personality cult at the Eighth 
CPC National Congress. At that time it was aimed at countering 
the personality cult starting to develop around Mao Zedong, but 
it was not upheld later and it led to the feverish cult for Mao 
Zedong and brought grave misfortunes to the party and the 
people. This state of affairs was basically curbed after the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Some 
time ago, some people in the party suggested hanging the 
portraits of present leaders. Comrade Zemin [Jiang Zemin] was 
opposed to this, and I supported him. It is right to hang the 
portraits of present leaders, but it is better not to. In 1980 
the central Secretariat made a decision against hanging the 
portraits of leaders for the next 20-30 years in an effort to 
eliminate blind worship and superstitions concerning any one 
individual. 
  Deng added: Of course, it will not do for a state or a 
political party not to have a program or a theory guiding its 
practice. The party's and state's theory of construction and 
development should be the crystallization of collective wisdom, 
which has stood the test of practice. These theories still have 
to be constantly substantiated, improved, and revised along with 
the progress of the times and the development of the state. One 
or several individuals may play a substantial, or even a crucial 
role at a certain stage or period. Nevertheless, one or several 
individuals belong to the party and the people, and therefore it 
is inadvisable to publicize any one individual to an excessively 
high level. True, some of my viewpoints differ from, and may 
even be antagonistic to Marxism. Some people in the outside 
world and in the party label me a "revisionist," and even a 
"traitor" to Marxism. Talking about revisionism, it is 
necessary to see in which direction it is "revised." If, after 
revision, the line, principles, and policies can push forward 
and accelerate state development and progress, enrich the 
people, and improve their living standard, then we should 
continue walking along this line. The most fundamental and 
important task of a political party governing on behalf of the 
people is to enhance the state's comprehensive national power 
and to improve the people's living standard. If we fail to do 
so, what right do we have to govern on behalf of the people? 
  Deng added: From now until the end of this century, it is 
still necessary to give more publicity to the line of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the 
resolution of the 14th party congress, and the leading 
collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core. In the last five years, there has been 
another substantial change in the country which finds 
concentrated expression in the firm and strong leadership of the 
present leading body. This is the result of implementing a 
correct line, a fact that all people without prejudice will 
admit. 
  The source said that Deng Xiaoping indicated explicitly that 
he should not have conferred on him such titles as honorary 
state president, honorary chairman of the military commission, 
honorary chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, and so on, because this would put him in an awkward 
position.

<F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by staff reporter: "Chen Ziming </F>
Suffers From All Kinds of Diseases and Ailments, Must Seek 
Permission Before Going Out"] 
  [Text] Wang Zhihong, wife of famous mainland dissident 
Chen Ziming, expressed a sense of relief over her husband's 
return home on 8 June, but she also expressed deep concern over 
the diseases her husband contracted in jail over past years. At 
present, Chen Ziming must ask for permission from the 
authorities concerned if he wants to go out. 
  Wang Zhihong yesterday accompanied her husband back to their 
home in Beijing. Unlike before, their home was surrounded by 
more than 10 uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Wang Zhihong 
said that the present situation of her husband and herself was 
delicate. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Chen Ziming's mother returned from her 
son's place. She was deeply worried about her son's health, and 
asked -- since her son had been allowed to seek medical 
treatment outside prison -- why the authorities still did not 
allow him to go out freely. 
  Chen Ziming is now suffering from heart disease, stomach 
disease, high blood pressure (100-160), and skin disease. 
According to his wife, except for the skin disease, all the 
diseases were contracted in prison. The greatest hope of Wang 
Zhihong is that her husband's diseases will be cured. 
  Chen Ziming is now living with his family, but he still 
cannot go out and return to society freely. Wang Zhihong was 
discontent with the fact that her husband had to "ask for 
permission from the authorities beforehand" if he wanted to go 
out. She is now negotiating with the authorities in a bid to 
achieve her husband's freedom. 
  After living in prison for five years, Chen Ziming lost some 
weight, but he was not dejected at having contracted many 
diseases. Wang Zhihong said that her husband was in a good 
mental condition and that the heavy mental pressure was 
mitigated. "However, the first thing now is to give him medical 
treatment." Wang also said that they were still facing the 
pressure from the authorities concerned. 
  Wang Zhihong, who spoke prudently, said that in the current 
sensitive period, it was inconvenient for Chen Ziming to say 
anything, but she hoped to express their thanks to overseas 
readers through this newspaper for their loving care. 
  It has been learned that after returning home, Chen Ziming 
continued to be under full surveillance by the authorities and 
could not come into contact with the outside world. In 
addition, his family was short of money, and they are concerned 
over their future livelihood. It is said that Chen's mother has 
formally expressed this concern to the authorities.

<F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>
  [Text] In an apparent move to slow the pace of reforms 
amid increasing social and economic instability, China's 
Communist Party chief and State President Jiang Zemin has called 
for caution in economic restructuring. A reform package would 
be introduced only when it would benefit the overall interest of 
the general public, Mr Jiang, was recently quoted as saying. It 
would be put in place only when the overall economy and society 
could stand for it, Mr Jiang added. Mr Jiang appeared to be 
more reserved than other leaders about the reforms. 
  Chinese sources said the leader's remarks were revealed by 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua during an important speech to senior 
economic officials at a national meeting on price in Beijing 
earlier this month. Mr Zou said the remark by the party boss 
was the consensus of all senior leaders' views and should act as 
a guideline for future economic reforms. The guideline, 
initiated by Mr Jiang, was also discussed and agreed by the 
party politburo at a recent meeting, a Chinese economic source 
quoted the vice-premier as telling senior economic officials 
from central ministries and provincial authorities. 
  China analysts and economists said the remarks were 
tantamount to ruling out any radical reforms, apparently 
highlighting the increasing concern among senior leaders with 
projected reform packages. 
  Despite this leaders have been cautious about pushing 
forward 
reform packages, many of which were worked out late last year 
and expected to be put in place either this year or next, they 
appear to be striking what they call a "balance among growth, 
reforms and social stability". [sentence as published] 
  "Now, Mr Jiang apparently rules out the possibility in 
pushing forward those more sensitive reforms as they could have 
by and large some impact on the economics and society," a Hong 
Kong-based mainland economist said. 
  Mr Jiang said that as political and economic situations were 
much more complicated than a decade ago, they required officials 
responsible for reforms and the economy to be much more 
cautious. Mr Jiang added that although reform packages could be 
introduced, they should be implemented step-by-step. However, 
officials should watch the implementation of reform policy 
closely and review the situation and the effectiveness regularly 
after it was introduced, Mr Jiang said.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Supreme People's 
Court today held a telephone conference to sum up achievements 
attained during an earlier period in cracking down on economic 
crimes and to make arrangements for further promoting the work 
of hearing and adjudication major and serious cases of economic 
crime by various people's courts so as to continue successfully 
the anticorruption struggle. 
  Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, 
presided over today's meeting. Liu Jiachen, vice president of 
the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the conference. He pointed 
out: People's courts throughout the country have centered their 
efforts on trying and adjudicating major and serious cases of 
economic crime in the struggle against corruption, and the 
overall situation is satisfactory. People's courts at various 
levels have followed the guidelines of the party Central 
Committee and the work arrangements of the Supreme People's 
Court, have concentrated their efforts on quickly trying and 
adjudicating a large number of major and serious cases of 
economic crime, have heavily punished serious law offenders in 
accordance with the law, and have attained significant results 
in promoting and deepening the anticorruption struggle. 
  According to a statistical report, the cases of economic 
crimes heard and adjudicated by people's courts in 1993 involved 
152 cadres at and above the department level, including eight 
cadres at the bureau level and one cadre at the vice minister 
level. 
  Liu Jiachen pointed out: We should soberly understand that 
the results achieved so far still cannot meet the demands of the 
party and the people and the requirements in the current 
anticorruption struggle. There are still some problems in the 
trials of major and serious economic cases which must not be 
overlooked. He said: In the next phase, people's courts 
throughout the country will have a heavier task in hearing and 
adjudicating major and serious cases of economic crime. 
Therefore, leading cadres of people's courts at various levels 
must personally take charge of the work and have the courage to 
resist all interference and obstacles in the trials of various 
cases. We must adhere to principles, rely on the party's 
leadership, and ensure the proper trial of various cases. We 
should handle various cases in a prompt manner with high quality 
and efficiency. We should establish a sound working system and 
guarantee the smooth flow of information. We should strengthen 
propaganda and increase the results in handing cases. 
  At the telephone conference, Liu Jiachen also explained the 
specific arrangements made by the Supreme People's Court for the 
trial of major and serious cases of economic crime in the next 
phase. He said: The Supreme People's Court, based on its 
understanding of major and serious cases of economic crime being 
handled at present, will promptly announce the results of trying 
those cases throughout the country in the next few months.

"China's Aviation Industry Badly Needs Import of Modern 
Management System"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 10 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The cause 
of the 6 June Xian plane crash is still under investigation. 
The Russian airplane manufacturer will send personnel to assist 
in the analysis. The plane crash, the most serious incident in 
China's civil aviation history, shows once again the serious 
problems in China's civil aviation safety. In order to quickly 
reverse the situation, the solution is not merely to purchase 
several more advanced planes from abroad, but more importantly 
to vigorously import the management system of the modern 
aviation industry to enable the quality of personnel and 
management levels to catch up with the speedily developing civil 
aviation industry. 
  State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua recently urged the 
management of China's civil aviation to draw a lesson from the 
air crash and to adopt more measures to step up security. In 
fact, the authorities' determination to step up aviation 
security is seen from the placement of new heads of the Civil 
Aviation General Administration at the end of last year and the 
upgrading of the General Administration from the vice 
ministerial level to the ministerial level. Moreover, the new 
personnel really have had new performance, which includes the 
promulgation of a series of regulations on air traffic 
management and several measures to upgrade services and 
safeguard the safety of civil aviation. Early this month, they 
held many meetings at which they stressed the paramount 
importance of "strict control." 
  Despite this, records of civil aviation safety are still 
worrying. In May, there were 17 incidents, which were followed 
by a plane explosion in the air. What were the reasons for the 
frequent incidents? According to an analysis by a senior 
official of China Northwest Airline, one of the main factors 
were that the civil aviation industry is developing too quickly 
and the corresponding technology, equipment, personnel, and 
management cannot catch up. In recent years, passenger volume of 
China's civil aviation has continuously increased at a rate of 
25 to 30 percent each year and several dozen local airlines have 
been newly set up. There is no denying that the delegation of 
executive powers and the increasing purchase of new airplanes 
from abroad help meet the huge need of the aviation market. But 
for the civil aviation industry, a special industry that gives 
priority to safety, introducing modern management concepts and 
systems and hiring overseas management and technical personnel 
in the field are important and must not be delayed. 
  China has already placed a record-breaking order for new 
American passenger planes to replace old models. But the 
immediate task is that it should, beginning with the management 
system, make great efforts with regard to personnel, training, 
maintenance, supervision, control, and logistics to ensure that 
regulations are implemented.

<F P=106> [Report: "Assault on Disc Pirates Picks Up Momentum"] </F>
  [Text] The momentum is gaining in the nationwide fight 
against pirated compact and laser discs, which should further 
tighten copyright protection across the country. 
  The crackdown, launched in mid-April, was intended to check 
the flow of illegal CDs and LDs and restore order to China's 
audio-visual market, which is plagued by piracy and bogus 
products. 
  The battle is particularly gaining ground in Beijing, 
Jiangsu 
and Guangdong provinces, according to Chinese reports. 
  Investigators have found that most Chinese audio-visual 
publishing houses, record stores, show rooms and night clubs 
follow the law, while a small portion seek illicit ways to gain 
quick profits. 
  In Beijing, police launched an attack last week in the 
entertainment market. They smashed three stores which sell 
pirated or smuggled goods, confiscated 1,607 LDs and 125 CDs in 
addition to 1,480 cassettes and tapes, the Beijing Daily 
reported on Friday. 
  Currently, the city has 120 audio-visual publishing houses, 
1,000 record shops, 400 show rooms and 500 night clubs. 
  Meanwhile, in East China's Jiangsu Province, fake discs also 
have been the main prey of investigators from publication 
administrations since early this year, the Press and Publication 
Journal reported on Friday. 
  Their first target was two LD factories in Jiangsu. 
  One of the plants was found violating copyright law and was 
fined 200,000 yuan ($23,000). 
  To add to the attack, investigators in the provincial 
capital 
of Nanjing have conducted six secret checks on the audio-visual 
market. 
  They confiscated more than 5,000 smuggled and pirated discs. 
  In Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other cities, the 
investigators also seized more than 15,000 copies. 
  With the attack, audio-visual markets in the province are 
taking on a new look, the journal said. 
  Furthermore, the journal added, Guangdong authorities have 
also targeted CD and LD smugglers during the past two months. 
  In addition to confiscating discs, they also closed down 
some 
unlicensed shopping stands. 
  Along with the nationwide attack, research from the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences suggested three ways to stem illegal 
pirating, the BEIJING DAILY reported.

<F P=106> [By Lu Jen (7627 0086)] </F>
  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, top CPC leaders 
have pointed out on various occasions that the year 1994 is 
crucial for China's reform and development, stressing that the 
situation brooks no undue optimism. In a speech made at 
the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission held in late February this year, CPC General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin clearly stressed the need to develop a 
"sense of crisis." Jiang's speech was so abridged that the 
term "sense of crisis" and relevant content disappeared when 
published by the news media, but the essentials of the speech 
remained unchanged. 
<H5>  Jiang Spoke About the Reasons for Developing a Sense of </H5>
Crisis 
  In August last year, Jiang spoke about combating corruption 
at the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, concentrating on making preparations for an 
anti-corruption campaign. In a speech at the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission meeting in late February this year, 
however, he mentioned the anti-corruption campaign in a more 
serious manner and made a grimmer estimation of the situation. 
  In appraising the anti-corruption campaign last year, Jiang 
said: "Corruption does exist in our party and government 
departments and it continues to spread in some areas." "If we 
treat the problem lightly and allow the malpractice to go 
unchecked, our party, the people's political power, and our 
socialist modernization drive will be doomed." Based on the 
findings and prosecutions over the last six months, Jiang 
admitted the problem was serious. "Corruption has penetrated 
into many areas of our social life," "the crimes of abusing 
power for personal gain and of perverting justice for bribes 
have reached an appalling point." 
  After advancing nine specific opinions on combating 
corruption, Jiang dwelt on the CPC's future. He pointed out 
that the CPC would fall from power if it failed to make 
achievements in promoting economic development or to hold 
corruption in check despite its success in economic construction. 
  A source said the seriousness of a great number of 
problems exposed by the anti-corruption campaign since last year 
was well beyond the CPC hierarchy's expectations. This is one 
of the reasons Jiang stressed the need to develop a sense of 
crisis, the source added. 
  Aside from this, Jiang also mentioned other problems which 
he 
said could not be underestimated. 
  The Clinton administration's policy toward China aims at 
achieving the same political evolution as that in the former 
Soviet Union so that the CPC will step down and China will 
become a dependency of Western countries. But Jiang maintained 
that recent developments in Russia had not followed the course 
expected by the West. The United States makes use of China's 
human rights to find fault in a bid to achieve something through 
pro-democracy activists. These pro-democracy activists are not 
dangerous; so long as our comrades keep in step with the party 
Central Committee politically, we can remove certain 
destabilizing factors in time. As disclosed by Jiang, a certain 
number of rather high-ranking leading cadres fail to keep in 
step with the party Central Committee politically. Jiang warned: 
We are clearly aware of this. Never suppose that we are in the 
dark. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji Said "Approval Procedures Give Rise to Corruption" </H5>
  Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau standing committee and vice premier, has spoken about 
corruption in the economic field on many occasions since the 
beginning of this year. 
  Zhu pointed out: Abuse of approval rights is a major 
reason for corruption. Many people believed that Zhu's remark 
referred to the serious and hardly suppressible corruption in 
the economic field. China has not separated politics from 
economics for a long time. Efforts have been made over the last 
few years to separate the two, but with little success. The 
functions of the administrative department have been basically 
separated from those of enterprises in form, but various 
approval procedures makes it possible for the administrative 
department to rule the roost, subjecting enterprises to its 
control. The fact that the administrative department requires 
enterprises to apply for approval before they can go ahead with 
their plans can only serve to prevent enterprises from 
exercising their right to make their own management decisions, 
thus leading to corruption. This is because such a 
practise will allow power to be traded for money. 
  Zhu said while telling cadres in the administrative 
department to correctly exercise their approval rights in the 
public interest, we must simplify approval procedures. The 
reform is aimed at lifting restrictions. This does not mean we 
should do away with the approval procedures, but we should 
minimize them. This is also essential to eliminating 
corruption, Zhu added. 
  When commenting on China's property development, Zhu 
called for early introduction of the system of appraising land 
prices. We should appraise land prices on a scientific basis 
and enlist the assistance of experts to act according to 
economic laws, Zhu continued. Zhu pointed out that the right of 
government officials to fix land price is also a cause of 
corruption. 
<H5>  Serious Inflation Brings High Pressure To Bear on Top CPC </H5>
Leadership 
  China's excessive inflation, which constitutes a serious 
problem, has applied high pressure to the CPC hierarchy. In his 
1994 government work report to the NPC, Li Peng proposed to keep 
the 1994 growth rate of retail prices below 10 percent. 
Developments in the first quarter, however, indicate it will be 
difficult to attain this intended goal. 
  According to the statistics released by the State 
Statistical 
Bureau, the economic growth rate has dropped to 9 or 10 percent 
in the first quarter of this year, but the inflation rate has 
continued to surge. Nationwide retail prices increased by 21 
percent over the same time last year. The inflation rate was 13 
percent nationwide last year. In June last year when 
macro-controls were put into effect, the growth rate of retail 
prices was only 12.5 percent. 
  China's present inflation bears two unprecedented features. 
One, inflation is found in both urban and rural 
areas. In the past, prices climbed in major and medium 
cities, but they remained relatively stable in the countryside. 
However, the countryside registers a two-digit inflation rate 
now. Two, both old and young suffer from inflation. 
In the past, only prices of consumption goods and charges for 
services not essential to daily lives were affected, but people 
have to pay more for the services and items of everyday use now. 
The CPC hierarchy has realized that if the situation worsens, 
economic order will be jeopardized and a large number of social 
problems will follow. 
  The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are said to 
have held several meetings after national conferences of the NPC 
and the CPPCC National Committee to study the current economic 
situation. They have decided to control the total volume of 
credit and of fixed assets investment to curb inflation and, at 
the same time, to increase the deposit rate in compensation for 
the people's losses incurred by the inflation. This 
notwithstanding, the possibility of a galloping inflation cannot 
be ignored. 
<H5>  Presevation of Political and Economic Stability Is of </H5>
Paramount Importance 
  In light of the present situation, the CPC has focused 
on maintaining political and economic stability this year in 
implementing the principle of "reform, development, and 
stability." Many economic reform measures which were to be 
introduced this year have been put off. In the political field, 
the CPC will conduct positive ideological education and take 
strong measures against destabilizing factors to eliminate them 
in the bud.

<F P=106> [By Huang Zhiling: "AIDS Deserves Attention Today"] </F>
  [Text] Probably nine out of every 10 Chinese could not say 
precisely how the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, or AIDS, is spread. 
  In the eyes of most Chinese people, AIDS is mainly a 
foreigners' disease. 
  But a report for the Chinese Government has warned that AIDS 
could be a serious problem. 
  The State Council Research Office report is based on 
research 
by the State Council and the ministry of Public Health which 
studied China's AIDS prevention and control programmes. 
  The world's first AIDS case was reported in the United 
States 
in 1981. 
  In the early 1990's, 400,000 patients around the world were 
diagnosed with AIDS. Nearly half of them were found in the 
United States. 
  Since the mid-1990's, however, the threat of AIDS has become 
of worldwide concern and it is now spreading especially fast in 
developing countries. 
  According to a conservative estimate by the World Health 
Organization, the world will have seen 50 million people 
infected by HIV by the year 2000. Most of these are expected to 
be in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 
  HIV is one of the viruses that causes AIDS. 
  China's first case of AIDS, in Beijing, was reported in June 
1985. The patient was an American tourist. 
  Since then, 1,361 cases of HIV infection have been reported 
in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; 1,106 
cases of HIV infection were found among mainland Chinese, the 
rest among foreigners and overseas Chinese. 
  Forty of the HIV carriers have developed AIDS, and 22 of 
them 
have died. 
  These figures were determined by a very small-scale testing 
operation among nearly 3 million people. 
  In China, the HIV virus has been spread mainly through the 
sharing of needles by intravenous drug users in Southwest 
China's Yunnan Province. More than 70 percent of China's AIDS 
cases reportedly come from Yunnan as a result of sharing needles. 
  However, in recent times, HIV infection from heterosexual 
contact is increasing faster than infection from sharing needles. 
  In 1991, 5.6 per cent of the HIV carriers were infected 
through sexual contact; in 1992, the figure was 13.8 per cent; 
and in 1993, 15.7 percent. 
  Outside Yunnan, most patients were found to have contracted 
HIV through sexual contact. 
  Before 1989, most HIV-carriers found in China were among 
foreigners. But since then, the number of Chinese infected with 
HIV has risen comparatively quickly. 
  The State Council report predicts that about 100,000 
mainland 
Chinese will be HIV-positive by the year 2000. The report 
predicts about 20,000 cases will have developed into full-blown 
AIDS. 
  The World Health Organization predicts that by the end of 
this century the number of HIV infected people in China will be 
no less than the average for Asian countries as a whole. 
  If this happens, China will have a large number of 
HIV-infected people. The danger of this happening is quite 
feasible, according to the State Council report. 
  The 1992 World Health Conference predicted by 2002, southern 
Sahara in Africa would be the hardest-hit HIV-infected region in 
the world, as it was at the time of the report. 
  But towards the end of this decade, it will be Asia, home to 
50 per cent of the world's population, that will witness a sharp 
rise in the spread of HIV. Each year, the number of Asians 
becoming infected with HIV is expected to be greater than the 
number of new infections in Africa. 
  A survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive 
Medicine shows that nearly half of the students investigated in 
eight Shenyang colleges, in Liaoning Province, did not fully 
understand how HIV was spread. 
  Public ignorance over how HIV is spread makes large-scale 
infections possible, said the State Council report. 
  The increase in prostitution in China is expected to make 
sexual contact the most common factor in the spread of the 
infection, said the State Council report. 
  Police authorities are also concerned over the increase in 
drug use and, along with that, needle-sharing that can spread 
HIV. 
  What is worse, say officials, is that drug users tend to be 
promiscuous. Women drug users often become involved in 
prostitution to finance their drug habit. This undoubtedly 
accelerates the spread of HIV, said the report. 
  China is yet to test all of its blood donor samples for 
traces of HIV. 
  Medical equipment, if not disinfected carefully, can be the 
agent for spreading HlV. In some of China's rural hospitals, 
medical equipment is not carefully disinfected, said the State 
Council report. 
  People aged between 18 and 45 are considered to be at the 
highest risk of contracting HIV. About 80 per cent of HIV-cases 
in China now are people aged between 20 and 49. Because this 
age group represents a normally productive part of society, the 
report says, the burden on the Chinese economy could be great. 
  Average annual medical expenses for AIDS patients range from 
3,300 to 7,400 yuan ($381 to $855), which is half the average 
annual family income in China. 
  According to the report, some high-ranking officials show 
indifference to the potentially devastating threat of AIDS in 
China. 
  China now has only 1,000 or so HIV-infected people, they 
argue. Even if this number were to increase 20-fold, it would 
still represent just a tiny fraction of the nation's populace, 
they say. 
  Many ordinary people still think AIDS is just a foreigners' 
disease and, providing one doesn't become involved in 
prostitution, doesn't represent a real danger. Also, some 
prostitutes think they can avoid infection by avoiding foreign 
clients, said the report. 
  Public awareness about the threat is at a low level in 
China. 
  Each year, wide publicity is given to the AIDS issue around 
December 1, which is World AIDS Day. But for the rest of the 
year, the problem is often ignored. 
  To increase public awareness on the AIDS problem, the 
Chinese 
media need to provide free time and space for public education, 
said the report.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (XINHUA) -- A recent survey by the 
State Education Commission's relevant department shows that 
today's college students positively support the policy of reform 
and opening up and hope that the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system is accelerated; they have a strong sense 
of participation and study hard in schools; and endeavoring to 
become a useful person has become the order of the day. 
  The survey was conducted simultaneously in 57 schools of 
higher learning in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong, 
and Shaanxi. A total of 14,500 questionnaires were passed out 
and some 1,360 college students were interviewed and surveyed 
[figures as received]. 
  The results of the survey show that college students 
positively support reform and opening up, and are heartened by 
the remarkable changes in various aspects of the national life 
since the reform and opening up policy was implemented. Ninety 
percent of the students believe that reform and opening up have 
"enhanced the comprehensive national strength," "raised the 
people's living standards," "emancipated productive forces," and 
"ushered in the best era in political and economic development 
since the founding of the PRC." Nearly one-half of the students 
deem that the government's measures to "respect teachers, 
emphasize education, and improve the condition of intellectuals" 
have yielded some results. 
  Students are generally optimistic about the future of 
socialist market economic system, and they have a better 
understanding of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. The majority of students believe 
that China will "certainly succeed" or "encounter some twists 
and turns but will ultimately succeed" in establishing a 
socialist market economic system. Of the major events of 
interest to the students over the past year, a considerable 
number of them show an interest in the publication of Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. They believe 
that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is "Marxism of contemporary China" and "a 
relatively systematic theory." 
  Steady progress in the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system has sparked the students' enthusiasm to study. 
Compared with two years ago, they have a greater initiative and 
are more conscientious in study. Eighty-five percent of them 
say they are "more anxious than before to learn some practical 
knowledge." Today, the heated discussion on "going into 
business" among college students has cooled down, while the 
number of college graduates applying for postgraduate schools is 
on the rise. Most students, guided by society's demand, 
voluntarily adjust their subject of study in a bid to improve 
their qualification. 
  What are the outlook on life and value concepts among 
college 
students today? The survey shows that the mainstream of 
students tends to have a forward-looking and noble-minded 
personality. They take "ideals," "conviction," "knowledge," 
"friendship," and "justice" as their dictums and pledge to "work 
hard and in a pioneering spirit in all circumstances," and to 
"subordinate individual interests to national and collective 
interests." 
  During interviews and surveys, college students show a great 
interest in some major domestic and international issues. They 
are discontent with the "West's interference in China under the 
pretext of human rights issue" and hope that earnest efforts be 
made to correct unhealthy practices and eliminate corruption in 
the party and society. As far as Chinese education is 
concerned, they hope that the educational reform be accelerated; 
they are heartened by the importance attached to education by 
the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the entire 
society. It is understood that many of their constructive 
suggestions have been included in the agenda of educational 
departments and school administrators at various levels.

<F P=106> [By Jiang Xianli (5592 7359 4409), director and </F>
editor-in-chief of HUNAN RIBAO: "Persistently Guide the People 
With Correct Publicity"] 
  [Text] This January, General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
emphatically pointed out at the National Conference on 
Propaganda and Ideological Work: "Our propaganda work must be 
aimed at arming the people with scientific theories, guiding the 
people with correct publicity, molding the people with noble 
spirits, encouraging the people with fine literature and art 
works, and at bringing up generations of well-educated and 
well-disciplined socialist new people who have high ideals and 
moral standards, thus providing a powerful ideological guarantee 
and opinion support for our great cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics." Comrade Jiang Zemin's remarks 
have not only pointed out the correct direction for the overall 
propaganda and ideological work but can also serve as a 
fundamental principle by which the press and media, including 
newspapers, radio, and television, can successfully keep a rein 
on the correct guidance of public opinion and persistently guide 
the people with correct publicity. 
  It must be admitted that during the great cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the press and media in 
China have done a great deal of work in persistently guiding our 
people with correct publicity, providing a powerful ideological 
guarantee and opinion support. Party newspapers and magazines, 
in particular, have played a guiding role in this regard. 
However, it does not mean that we have done a perfect job and 
that there is no need for any improvement in providing correct 
guidance for public opinion. As a matter of fact, if we study 
the current situation in China's press and publishing circles 
with a sober mind, we can bring to light many things we do not 
wish to see. Over recent years, some people have been fond of 
reporting "hot issues" and seeking novelties with a view to 
creating so-called "sensational effects"; others are obsessed 
with the desire for gain and have engaged in providing 
"compensated news coverage" regardless of the adverse social 
effects these might cause; insisting on everyone going their own 
way, some have made irresponsible comments and violated the 
discipline of news reporting and propaganda; others have run 
counter to the policies on religion, impaired the unity among 
different nationalities, and affected the overall situation of 
stability; yet others have lowered their ideological guard and 
neglected the principle of "using different yardsticks for 
domestic- and overseas- oriented reports," leading to leakages 
of state secrets; some are involved in spreading "noises" with a 
low taste, having lost the main melody; and others have taken a 
subjective and one-sided approach to problems, failed to conduct 
thoroughgoing investigations, and engaged in making arbitration 
by default. All these show clearly that some of our comrades 
have failed to acquire a correct understanding as to how to 
guide the people with correct publicity. Therefore, there is an 
urgent need for us to restudy the issue, so that we can deepen 
our understanding and enhance our consciousness in implementing 
the guidelines from the National Propaganda and Ideological Work 
Conference. 
  Public opinion comprises those comments and remarks made by 
the majority of people in certain social circles and can 
therefore be regarded as the biased views of the majority on a 
specific situation or issue. Since they are of an open nature, 
such tendentious opinions will produce a strong spiritual 
strength once they are combined with the masses of the people, 
the main body of public opinion. This spiritual strength is 
irreplaceable by any material forces. Therefore, people in all 
social circles attach great importance to public opinion: They 
consciously or unconsciously become the recipients of public 
opinion and even directly involve themselves in creating public 
opinion, thus becoming the main body of public opinion. In real 
life, those who are involved in making public opinion include 
not only common people and mass organizations but also cultural 
and educational departments, literature and art groups, 
propaganda and ideological departments, and the press and other 
media. All these main bodies of public opinion are operated by 
people who are conscious of their responsibilities and act 
either carefully or impetuously in pursuit of certain goals. 
These people, or bodies and parties which represent the 
interests of these people, belong to certain social strata, 
social bodies, and political groups; moreover, due to their 
different experiences in life, they take different approaches to 
and employ different methods for problems which confront them 
and will have different views and opinions on the same social 
issue. All these views and opinions need to be strongly 
expressed through different channels or in different forms; as a 
result, differences in public opinion begin to shape up. These 
public opinions are both the outcome of people's reasoning and 
the outbreak of their feelings. Judging by the tendentiousness 
of public opinion, it can be roughly divided into two major 
categories, namely correct and incorrect public opinion. The 
official newspapers of party committees at all levels, for their 
part, should play their role as mouthpieces for the party during 
their participation in creating public opinion, accurately 
propagate the party's policies and principles, and make vigorous 
efforts to spread correct opinions. When the guidance of public 
opinion is correct, our people can work with one heart and one 
mind in high spirits; otherwise, the consequences will be 
disastrous. Both positive and negative experiences tell us that 
it is of vital importance to persistently guide our people with 
correct publicity. 
  To successfully guide the people with correct publicity we 
should first differentiate between correct and incorrect public 
opinion. Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out: "By raising the 
requirement to persistently guide the people with correct 
publicity, we mean to create public opinion which is favorable 
to deepening reform and opening up, establishing a socialist 
market economic structure, and developing the productive forces 
of the society; favorable to strengthening the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the 
legal system; favorable to encouraging and arousing people to 
carry out hard struggle and open new paths in order to make our 
country strong, our people rich, and our society prosperous; 
favorable to helping people differentiate right from wrong, 
uphold the true, the good, and the beautiful, and resist the 
false, the bad, and the ugly; and favorable to bringing about 
national reunification and unity among all nationalities, giving 
our people a contented life, and maintaining social and 
political stability." It can thus be seen that all public 
opinion favorable to our work in the aforementioned fields can 
be regarded as correct; otherwise, it cannot rated as correct. 
  It is decided by the party spirit of party newspapers and 
magazines to keep rein on correct guidance for public opinion 
and to persistently guide the people with correct publicity. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "Party newspapers and 
magazines must give unconditional publicity to propositions by 
the party." Here, Comrade Deng Xiaoping placed stress on "must" 
and "unconditional." That is to say, party newspapers and 
magazines should, and "must," propagate propositions by the 
party and such propagation must be "unconditional." The word 
"must" means that we are not allowed to hesitate or waver on 
this issue and the word "unconditional," tells us not to take a 
negative attitude or bargain with the party. We must uphold the 
party spirit of party newspapers and magazines conscientiously, 
translate this spirit into our practical work, and permeate 
every report with this spirit. Only by so doing can we 
correctly propagate the party's theories, line, policies, and 
principles; reflect in a vivid way the great practice of the 
masses of the people; arouse all positive factors and turn 
negative factors into positive ones; unite all forces that can 
be united; and strive to fulfill the grand goal of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  It is a demand of the party's cause to keep a rein on 
correct 
guidance for public opinion and to persistently guide the people 
with correct publicity. Our mass media is a component part of 
the entire cause of the party. To give publicity to the party's 
propositions and fulfill the party's tasks, we must pay close 
attention to the work of the mass media. This is also decided 
by the roles of the press and other media. Comrade Mao Zedong 
once pointed out: "The reason why newspapers can play an 
important role is that they can most rapidly make accessible the 
party's program and line, principles and policies, and work 
tasks and methods to the masses on the most extensive scale." 
Therefore, making full use of and running newspapers properly 
is "an issue of great principled significance in the party's 
overall work which should not be belittled." The 
several-decade-long history of our party has clearly showed that 
our victories in both revolution and construction cannot be 
separated from the propaganda and ideological work or from the 
roles of the mass media. Today, China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive have entered a new development phase. 
During the course of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we face new situations, new tasks, and new 
practices which require us to give play to the media role of 
party newspapers all the more. For instance, under the present 
new situation wherein packaged measures on the structural reform 
of finance and taxation, banking, investment, and commodity 
prices have already been put into effect, we should not only 
take into consideration the overall situation from a high 
strategic plane, give in-depth publicity to the party's line, 
principles, and policies, and make every effort to enable the 
masses to understand and master them but also provide the masses 
with convincing explanations on the new reform measures in 
simple language. We should summarize, spread, commend, and 
disseminate new experiences created by the masses and commend 
advanced individuals who have emerged in the practice of reform; 
conduct in-depth studies and research on all new subjects and 
contradictions cropping up during the process of reform, making 
every effort to resolve them as soon as they show up; and, 
through opinion supervision, try our best to overcome and 
straighten passive tendencies in our social life. To promote 
the reform, opening up, and modernization drive, we must let 
China know more about the world and let the world acquire a 
better understanding of China. However, we cannot realize this 
goal if we fail to guide the people with correct publicity. All 
this has clearly shown that doing a good job in propaganda and 
publicity and providing the people with correct opinion guidance 
is the demand of reform and opening up and also a requirement of 
our party in its effort to lead the people of the whole country 
in carrying out the grand cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  It is the wish and demand of the masses of the people to 
keep a rein on correct guidance of public opinion and to 
persistently guide the people with correct publicity. Party 
newspapers should serve the people and socialism. Today, the 
people of the entire country are engaged in a drive for 
socialist modernization. This is a cause led by the party in 
which the people rely on their own strength and work for their 
own interests. themselves. Facing such a reality, our 
newspapers should understand that if they want to provide good 
services and become useful to this cause of the people and also 
to the socialist modernization drive, a primary condition is 
that they must provide the people with correct publicity which 
has a unifying force and can inspire people's spirits. This is 
a prerequisite for party newspapers to win the trust of the 
people. Marx once pointed out: "The trust of the people is the 
condition on which newspapers depend for existence. Without this 
condition, newspapers will be totally lifeless." (Volume I of 
The Collected Works of Marx and Engels, p 234) 
Therefore, to inject life into themselves, newspapers should 
provide publicity that can serve as the guidance for our society 
and a clarion call of our times. To this end, the press and 
media should act under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
well as the party's basic line; implement the spirits of the 
14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee in every field of endeavor; speed up the 
pace of building a socialist market economic structure; maintain 
a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic growth; 
safeguard the political stability; and bring about comprehensive 
social progress. Only by so doing can we ensure that the press 
and media adhere to a correct orientation. 
  It is also an objective requirement of the development of 
both the domestic and international situations to keep a rein on 
the correct guidance of public opinion and to persistently guide 
the people with correct publicity. Under the present domestic 
and international situations, which are favorable to our efforts 
to push forward reform and construction, it is beyond doubt that 
we should seize this favorable opportunity, provide our people 
with correct publicity, and guide the enthusiasm of hundreds of 
millions of people toward the grand cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. However, the cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is one which needs the 
efforts of hundreds of millions of people and which can only be 
accomplished through hard struggle for several generations. 
Therefore, to maintain the vitality of this cause pioneered by 
our party, and to ensure that there is no lack of successors to 
carry on the cause, the official newspapers of party committees, 
as part of the party's propaganda and ideological organs, must 
view the matter from a high strategic plane and ensure that the 
publicity they provide is aimed at "training and bringing up 
generations of well-educated and well-disciplined socialist new 
people who have high ideals and moral standards." Meanwhile, 
our press and other media should also undertake the task of 
using truth and facts to expose certain foreign hostile forces 
which are stepping up efforts to lay an opinion siege to and 
vilify the image of China by means of propagating capitalist 
outlooks on value, human rights, democracy, and freedom. All 
this tells us that it is a must for us to attach great 
significance to the press and media work from the high plane of 
the future and fate of socialism and to provide our people with 
correct publicity with a strong sense of dedication and a lofty 
sense of responsibility. We should center our efforts around 
the goal of bringing up new people with "four have's"; carry out 
among the masses of the people, especially among young people 
and children, ideological and ethical education that is focused 
on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; conduct education on 
building up the country through thrift and hard work, on 
occupational ethics and social morality, and on basic national 
conditions; and spread legal knowledge among the people. We 
must pay close attention to guiding people, especially young 
people and children, to establish correct ideals, beliefs, and 
outlooks on the world, life, and value; make every effort to 
oppose money worship, hedonism, pleasure-seeking, and 
out-and-out egoism; and resist the corrosive influence of 
decadent capitalist and feudalist ideologies. 
  The purpose in analyzing problems is to solve them. To 
persistently guide the people with correct publicity and realize 
the value of news during the course of adapting ourselves to the 
needs of the society, we must, in my opinion, handle the 
following relationships properly: 
  1. we should handle the relations between enlivening 
news reporting and keeping a rein on the correct orientation of 
public opinion./ It is an inherent requirement of the media to 
enliven news reporting because stereotyped news reports do not 
attract the attention of readers and will therefore prove 
lifeless. As a matter of fact, news reporting can also play a 
part in enlivening public opinion. This is because the 
objective reality is ever changing and it can present us with an 
infinite variety of fantastic phenomena; therefore, so long as 
we can catch these changes, make true reports, and "trace their 
sources, seek the truth, and find out the cause" (The 1979 
edition of "Correspondence During My Stay in Europe" by Zhou 
Enlai published by RENMIN RIBAO Publishing House, p 5), vivid 
news reports will appear in newspapers. 
  However, by urging 
people to enliven news reporting, we neither hope them to make 
so-called objective reports in an indiscriminate way; nor do we 
encourage them to report only "hot issues," hunt for novelty, 
and pursue so-called "sensational effects" in order to pander to 
the "novelty-seeking" tastes or the unhealthy mentalities of 
certain readers. What we mean by urging people to enliven news 
reporting is to encourage them to keep a rein on a correct 
orientation for public opinion and bring the new reporting more 
in line with the requirements of the party and the people for 
the fulfillment of the grand cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Because party newspapers speak on 
behalf of the party and the government and enjoy a high 
authoritativeness, the masses of the people regard the reports, 
articles, and comments carried by party newspapers as the views 
of and propositions by the party and the government; by the same 
token, foreign countries also keep close watch on the moves of 
our country by analyzing party newspapers. Under such 
circumstances, party newspapers should proceed from the 
fundamental interests of the party and the country; consciously 
act in unison with the party Central Committee politically; have 
a firm grasp of the party's basic line; provide their readers 
with news reports they love to read with a view to seeking unity 
of thinking among the whole party and the people of the entire 
country; and render better services for the reform, opening up, 
and modernization drive. To uphold the party's basic line and 
never waver for 100 years, we need to have a good grasp of 
opinion guidance and maintain the continuity and stability of 
the keynote of propaganda. In the light of changes in the real 
situation during different periods, party newspapers will make 
appropriate changes to the emphasis of propaganda and news 
reporting. However, the basic contents of propaganda will 
remain unchanged and no one is allowed to change at will such 
standard terms as the party's basic line, centering around 
economic construction, upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, 
persistently carrying out reform and opening up, maintaining 
social stability, strengthening the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization, reinforcing the building of democracy 
and the legal system, and opposing corruption and advocating a 
clean administration. We must see to it that efforts to 
propagate these contents should not be relaxed at one time and 
tightened at another time; instead, all these contents should be 
publicized in a thoroughgoing and sustained way. This year, our 
news reporting and propaganda work should be subordinate to and 
serve the overall situation of "seizing favorable opportunities, 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, stepping up development, 
and maintaining stability." To this end, we must provide 
accurate propaganda on reform measures and aim our news reports 
at different readers; when reporting sensitive issues, we should 
have a good sense of propriety, pay attention to the tactics we 
employ, and give reports which are favorable to reform, 
development, and stability; when reporting issues about whioch 
the masses are most concerned or doubtful, instead of evading 
problems, we should promptly give correct answers and 
explanations to the masses, provide them with a positive 
guidance, and tell them in explicit yet sensible terms which 
understandings are correct and which are one-sided or even 
incorrect. In short, we should integrate healthy contents with 
the highest possible perfection of manifestation and try our 
best to help party newspapers cultivate their own specific 
features and styles. 
  2. We must handle the relations between critical 
reporting and positive propaganda. Doing a good job in 
critical reporting and strengthening opinion supervision is a 
manifestation of the combativeness of news reporting and also 
one of its indispensable functions. By providing necessary 
critical reporting, party newspapers can help people tell the 
good from the bad and the right from the wrong through 
comparisons and evaluations, thus safeguarding the truth and 
promoting healthy tendencies. As a result, party newspapers can 
exert an influence on the progress and promote the 
transformation of things. Therefore, critical reporting is a 
weapon for guiding social opinion, a weapon that should not be 
discarded. It is just as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We 
should attach great importance to investigations into and 
studies of the social opinions and mentality of the masses, 
reflect the opinions and suggestions of the vast numbers of the 
masses in a positive manner, and strengthen our supervision over 
public opinion." However, we should and ought to rely mainly on 
positive propaganda when we try to provide opinion guidance. 
This is because the building of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics under the leadership of the party is an 
unprecedented cause and both the cause itself and the masses of 
the people who plunge themselves into the cause deserve 
commendation. During this historical process, the trend that 
the people create history always remains a healthy mainstream 
and the bright side always occupies a dominant position. Of 
course, it does not mean that we will stop exposing and 
criticizing things which should be exposed and criticized. What 
we should do is to make positive and constructive criticisms 
which are aimed at helping the party and government improve 
their work, solving practical problems, enhancing unity among 
the people, and maintaining social stability. 
  To 
successfully uphold the principle of relying mainly on positive 
propaganda, we need to center our work around the central task 
of economic construction at all times, guiding the enthusiasm 
and creativity of the masses toward the current campaign of 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, and promoting the 
socialist market economic development and also toward the 
fulfillment of all tasks in the modernization drive. We need to 
concentrate our major efforts on reflecting the reality that the 
socialist cause with Chinese characteristics is forging ahead 
and bringing about changes day after day and on enthusiastically 
eulogizing the noble spirit and glorious accomplishments of the 
masses of the people in transforming the world and creating a 
new life. To carry out the principle of relying mainly on 
positive propaganda, we should first master dialectics and avoid 
one- sidedness in propaganda and news reporting. In particular, 
we should refrain from "exaggerating things," for exaggeration 
of even good things will end up in adverse results or even 
create bias. Second, we need to enhance our propaganda and news 
reporting skills, improve the writing style and the literary 
grace of our reports, and try to "write on the impulse of our 
emotions," thus adding a greater appeal, inspiration, and 
convincing force to our news reports. 
  3. We should handle the relations between economic 
returns and social results. Under the conditions of the 
socialist market economy, party newspapers have not only the 
general attribute of commodities but also a special attribute 
not possessed by general material products. Party newspapers 
are used to satisfy the needs of the spiritual lives of the 
people. This feature of possessing two kinds of attributes 
requires party newspapers to attach a greater importance to 
social results while paying attention to economic returns. It 
stands to reason that organs running party newspapers should act 
in line with newspaper-running rules as well as the operational 
laws of the market; strictly separate reporters and editorial 
staff from those engaged in production and operations, allowing 
the latter to take charge of the economic operations of the 
newspaper industry; and see to it that party newspapers can 
enjoy a larger number of subscribers and a bigger distribution 
volume, lower production costs, and enhanced economic returns. 
However, the enhancement of economic returns must be based on 
social results. As an information carrier, newspapers should 
give expression to their value not mainly through their direct 
economic returns but through their social results, namely, 
through their role of giving a tremendous impetus to the 
development of social productive forces and to the comprehensive 
progress of society. To successfully realize the best social 
results in news reporting, party journalists are required to 
integrate the objective value of news with the demands of the 
party and the people, so that their news reports can not only 
satisfy the desire of society for information, thus realizing 
the value of news reporting, but also play the role of giving 
publicity to the will, aspirations, and requirements of the 
party and the people, realizing the propaganda value of news 
reporting. All one-sided concepts and moves which lay stress on 
one side to the neglect of the other are detrimental and might 
directly or indirectly hold up the realization of social results 
of news reporting. Over the past several years, certain news 
units have had a tendency to pursue economic returns 
one-sidedly, thus impairing the social results of news 
reporting. For example, proceeding from the interests of small 
units and bodies, certain units have violated the principle of 
providing true information by engaging in selling newspaper 
columns and in making "news reports for compensation"; as a 
result, such news reports have totally lost their true value to 
society. Driven by the desire for money and obsessed by 
"handsome rewards" offered by some localities and units, some 
reporters have brought out reports which are inconsistent with 
the policies and principles of the party; as a result, their 
reports have lost the glamor of their propaganda value. What is 
more, under the corrosive influence of individualism, egoism, 
and money worship, a handful of reporters and editors have gone 
so far as to violate political discipline and sell party and 
state secrets to people outside China, thus turning themselves 
into criminals. We should take warning from all these problems 
and phenomena. 
  4. We should handle the relations between bringing 
into play the key role of news units and arousing the enthusiasm 
of all sides. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Party 
newspapers, party magazines, state news agencies, as well as 
radio and television stations, should all actively propagate the 
propositions by the party, playing a key role in providing the 
people with correct publicity." This is not only a great 
expectation of the party on the press circles but also our due 
responsibility. We must exert our utmost efforts to propagate 
correct public opinion, persistently guide our people with 
correct publicity, and live up to the great expectations of the 
party on the press circles. To this end, we should continue to 
strengthen the building of the press contingent and bring up a 
large number of reporters and editors who are politically 
qualified, proficient in professional work, and honest and 
upright in their ways. This serves as an organizational 
guarantee to our efforts to bring into play the pillar role of 
the press contingent. Moreover, the work of persistently 
guiding the people with correct publicity is not only the 
business of the press circles but also a task of overall 
importance for the party on its entire propaganda and 
ideological front. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to 
further reinforce the party's leadership over public opinion and 
mobilize forces from all sides to care about, pay close 
attention to, support, and participate in the work of guiding 
our people with correct publicity. Only by so doing can we 
create a sound opinion environment for the cause of the reform, 
opening up, and modernization in which we are currently engaged.

<F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Urban Pay Stays Ahead of Inflation"] </F>
  [Text] China's non-agricultural employment has shrunk this 
year while urban wages have outpaced double-digit inflation. 
  By the end of April non-farm employment stood at 147.41 
million, according to the latest statistics released by the 
State Statistics Information and Consultancy Service Centre. 
  Comparisons with the beginning of this year were not 
available, but employment in November stood at 147.716 million 
and in October it was 147.533 million. 
  State industries' employment in April stood at 108.69 
million, compared with 108.833 million in November. 
  Of the workers employed in State industries, 25.63 million 
were working under contract, the report said. 
  Collective enterprises employed 33.69 million people, 
compared with 35.524 million in November, while foreign-funded 
and private firms had 5.02 million workers, up from 3.36 million 
in November. 
  Meanwhile, the wages paid out in the first four months 
totalled 169.14 billion yuan ($19.44 billion), which was 28.1 
percent more than the same period last year. 
  Of that payroll, State industries accounted for 132.38 
billion yuan ($15.22 billion), up 28 percent, collective 
enterprises paid 28.2 billion yuan ($3.24 billion), up 14.7 per 
cent; and foreign- funded and private firms paid 8.56 billion 
yuan ($1 billion), up a hefty 111.6 percent. 
  In another development, April's retail price index -- the 
country's most important inflation indicator -- rose 19.5 
percent over the same month last year. 
  At the same time, the cost-of-living index gained 21.7 
percent and the price index of agricultural products soared 24 
percent.

  [Text] Government officials, government-sanctioned labour 
unions, and bosses of sweatshop factories are shielding one 
another in the exploitation of Chinese workers, an article 
carried by a mimeographed underground newsletter distributed in 
Shenzhen alleges. The only answer to protect workers' rights and 
interests was an independent workers' union free from government 
and party control, it said. 
  The newsletter, Workers' Square, was put out by a group of 
labour activists trying to organise workers in the Shenzhen 
Special Economic Zone. Three of the activists Li Wenmin, Kuang 
Lezhuang, and Liu Hutang were reportedly arrested last month in 
Shenzhen. Although their arrests have been reported in the Hong 
Kong press, the Shenzhen Government and public security 
authorities refused to confirm them. But a source said the 
activists had been followed and were under police surveillance 
since early this year. Despite the strong pressure, the 
activists managed to put out three issues of the Workers' Square 
before they were arrested, the source said. 
  According to copies of the Workers' Square obtained by the 
SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, the activists held that only when 
united could workers fight against exploitation, and they could 
no longer rely on the official unions to protect their interests. 
  The first issue of the publication blasted authorities for 
allowing sweatshop factory bosses to ignore safety regulations. 
One of the most appalling cases was a fire that killed 84 
workers in a toy factory in Shenzhen last November. "Employers, 
unions and government officials have been shielding one another. 
They ignore regulations, abuse the lawful rights of workers and 
humiliate workers' dignity. China is a signatory of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights," the article says. "It 
is a member of the International Labour Organisation and has 
promulgated a large number of labour laws. But why do so many 
of our wishes remain mere illusion even until today? Why are we 
still alone in disputes?" the article asks. "The answer is that 
we haven't united." Another article cited a dispute in a 
garment factory in September last year, saying that government 
labour authorities had failed in looking after the interests of 
workers. There were articles and verses on the misery of 
workers in sweatshop factories. 
  "The improvement of working environments, improvement of 
living conditions, shortening of hours and increase of wages 
will not be bestowed on us," an article said. "It's something 
we must fight for. If we unite, we will become a strong force." 
  The editors of Workers' Square said that a publication by 
workers and for workers was the first step to fight 
exploitation. It was a forum to expose "crimes committed by 
capitalists".

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (CNS) -- According to the 
Department of Industry and Transport of the State Statistical 
Bureau, since the beginning of the second quarter this year, 
industrial production growth has speeded up at a certain degree 
with such growth in May being two percentage points higher than 
the first quarter, the highest in the same period in the past 
ten or more years. Some problems, including the improper 
linking of production with marketing and low-efficiency of 
enterprises, however, still exist in this sector. 
  According to statistics, between January and May, the added 
value earned by the industrial sector at township level and 
above across the country was RMB [renminbi] 619.6 billion, 
increasing by 16 per cent over the same period last year, and 
the industrial output value in this period in the country was 
RMB 1390.5 billion, 19 per cent up. Of this, RMB 144.7 billion 
of industrial added value and RMB 363.4 billion of industrial 
output value were earned in May, increasing respectively by 17.3 
per cent and 20.5 per cent. 
  The light industrial output value last month in the country 
increased by 23.2 per cent over the same month last year, the 
heavy industrial output value by 18.2 per cent. The growth of 
the former was five percentage points higher than that of the 
latter, and the gap between the two industries' growths 
continued to widen. 
  Since the beginning of this year, light industrial 
production 
has maintained a comparatively high growth. Key durable 
consumer goods and household electrical appliances like wrist 
watches, cameras, video cassette recorders, tape recorders, hifi 
sets, washing machines, refrigerators, air conditioners, and 
vacuum cleaners increased by a range from 30 to 180 per cent. 
Products of textiles, chemical fibre, and clothing grew by a 
rang from 18.5 per cent to 51.2 per cent. 
  The gross output volume of energy last month was 100.93 
million tonnes, 9.1 percentage points higher than the same 
period last year and 5.6 percentage points higher than the first 
four months. Of this, crude coal increased by 10.9 per cent, 
electricity by 12.2 per cent, and crude oil by 1.5 per cent. 
  Relevant officials pointed out that some problems still 
existed in this sector. The sales value of industrial products 
in May was RMB 335.8 billion, 18.1 per cent up over the same 
period last year but 2.4 percentage points lower than that of 
their production in the same period. The ratio of sales to 
production of such products last month was 92.77 per cent, 2.39 
percentage points lower than the same period last year. This 
ratio in the first five months was 92.38 per cent, a drop of 
1.57 percentage points over the same period last year. 
  According to the Bureau, industrial output value in June 
will 
reach RMB 390 billion, about l9 per cent up over the same month 
last year.

<F P=106> [By Fu Jian: "New Assessments Aim To Raze Inefficiency"] </F>
  [Text] The government plans a national system to ensure 
investments are being used efficiently. Vice-Minister of 
Finance Jin Renqing said this will help ensure the quality and 
efficiency of new State-invested projects. 
  Evaluations have been conducted for several years in China, 
but it is time to make the process more scientific and 
authoritative. We should establish a standardized system," said 
Jiang Weixin, vice-director of the Major Construction Department 
of the State Planning Commission (SPC). 
  Hao Jun, managing director of China International 
Engineering 
Consulting Corporation, which is China's leading group 
conducting the evaluations, said such projects have been 
partially checked for years but no comprehensive monitoring was 
done until the mid-1980's. 
  During the previous 45 years trillions of yuan was invested 
in capital improvements by the government. 
  But without an effective evaluation system in place to 
examine the wisdom of the investments, the system was 
susceptible to abuse. 
  Under the leadership of the State Planning Commission, China 
International Engineering started examining major projects 
involving government outlays in 1988. 
  In 1990, regulations for conducting the evaluations were 
stipulated by the State Council for trial implementation, 
according to vice-director Jiang. So far, 33 projects involving 
45.6 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) of investments have been 
examined by the consulting corporation. 
  These include 24 major construction projects and nine that 
involve foreign investments. 
  Most of the projects involve raw materials, energy, power, 
and transportation; other projects are in agriculture, 
broadcasting, and education. 
  Loans have been extended by the World Bank and foreign 
governments to help complete these assessments. 
  Usually, the assessment follows an interim period after the 
project has been started; sometimes its done after construction 
is completed. 
  The assessments cover such things as: 
  --Whether a project has been correctly decided. 
  --Whether the design, construction and production of the 
projects emulated past successes and avoided past failures. 
  --Whether the efficiency of the project was enhanced by 
using 
figures to evaluate if the project would be of use and how long 
it would take to recoup the investment. 
  -Whether the project has been useful to the nation. For 
example, has it protected the environment or raised employment? 
  To do the assessments, data received from the projects are 
compared with data from previously designed projects. Through 
the comparison, the success or failure of a project can be 
evaluated. A work unit of professionals is assigned to check 
the accuracy of data supplied by a construction firm. 
  About 95 per cent of the projects surveyed by the consulting 
corporation have proved to be efficient and have achieved 
planned levels of productivity, according to Xia Tongqing, chief 
engineer of the corporation. 
  Only one project, said Xia, was found to be seriously flawed 
and causing irretrievable loses. 
  Problems such as exceeding the budget during construction, 
inability to predict fluctuation of interest and foreign 
exchange rates, and lack of co-ordination among related projects 
have been revealed through the evaluations. 
  The appraisals are sent to those who had endorsed and 
constructed the projects so they can examine whether their 
decisions were correct. They then can make adjustments on the 
remainder of the project. 
  In 1994 assessments will be conducted on more than 10 
additional projects designated by the SPC and the State Economy 
and Trade Commission. 
  Besides the SPC, other organizations such as the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Ministry of Communications, the People's 
Construction Bank of China and provinces such as Heilongjiang, 
Liaoning, Gansu, and Yunnan have also conducted assessments of 
their own projects. 
  The State Auditing Administration also assesses projects 
each 
year. But such assessments usually cover only a few aspects. 
  "A unified and standardized system is needed to make the 
evaluations more comprehensive and scientific," said Hao. 
  As the government reforms the investment system to adjust to 
a market economy, it has focused its attention on improving the 
effectiveness of the government's investments. 
  "Advanced practices of project assessment in the world, 
which 
have developed since the middle 1970s, can be used as 
references,!' said Xia. 
  Developed countries and international organizations such as 
Britain, Australia, and the World Bank, have aided China in its 
research. 
  The World Bank has just announced that it will donate 
$400,000 as the first step in helping China establish the 
assessment systems. 
  According to the World Bank, an efficient system needs close 
ties with government plans, publicity, and serviceability. 
  For the Chinese system, specific organizations should be 
established nationwide firstly. Then a series of methods will 
be developed in accordance with the real situation of China and 
a number of specific staff workers will be trained. 
  An outline for the system is to be decided by the State 
Council and measures suited to the Chinese situation are still 
to be developed. But the result will surely be the creation of 
a unified, independent organization to survey projects, 
according to Vice Minister Jin.

<F P=106> [By Yang Jianbai (2799 1017 4101) of the Economic Research </F>
Institute of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: "On Planning 
and Macroregulation and Control in the Socialist Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Market Mechanism-Led Disposition of Resources 
  A market economy is an economy in which the operation of 
social production changes with the market and the supply and 
demand of commodities is regulated by the market mechanism. In 
the context of a market economy, in order for products to attain 
market share, production operators must follow the market 
mechanism in utilization of resources (manpower and physical 
resources). Once the utilization of resources is determined and 
implemented, it works on the entire process of production. 
Market mechanisms are reflected through commodity price 
signals. Price changes are always caused by quantitive changes 
of supply versus demand. Therefore, one can observe the market 
demand on the variety and quantity of commodities through price 
changes. It is by such observation and judgment that production 
operators determine utilization of resources in determining 
parameters and making projections. This is the very role of 
market mechanism. 
  As we know, the operation of social production starts with 
the utilization of resources and ends with the realization of 
market share. In the continuous operation of social 
reproduction, market reaction to past production must be used as 
a link to consider and arrange utilization of resources for 
current production. If all production units can correctly 
analyze and master the objective reality of market changes based 
on market share of the foregoing period and make accurate 
projections and properly utilize resources, they should be able 
to help utilization of resources society-wide move toward 
optimization and promote smooth and unobstructed development of 
a market economy. However, we should also be aware that the 
continuous development of a market economy is driven by the 
mechanism of competition. Competition among different operation 
units in pursuit of their own interests promotes development on 
the one hand, and, on the other, inevitably also has some 
blindness, causing a market economy to experience imbalance, 
fluctuations, and even crisis from time to time. 
  It is necessary to point out here that what is called the 
role of market mechanisms means the operation and role of the 
law of value in a theoretical sense, because the law of value is 
brought into play via market mechanisms. What is called market 
mechanism-led utilization of resources is in fact an issue of 
conscious application of the law of value. The law of value is 
the basic law of a commodity economy. It is in essence a law 
which describes changes of value and price and, through such 
changes, subsequently describes changes of supply and demand. 
The basic function of the law of value lies in determination by 
value, i.e., using value as the yardstick for measuring cost and 
efficiency. High-efficiency products can bring high profits as 
their resource consumption is less than the average; on the 
other hand, low efficiency and high consumption will cause 
losses. This mechanism also reflects the mechanism of 
competition. It encourages the advanced and spurs the backward. 
Only with outstanding efficiency can an enterprise become a 
winner in competition, or else it will be eliminated. 
Therefore, a production operator must be good at consciously 
applying the law of value to match the utilization of resources 
with the objective reality of market changes. Whether or not 
the utilization of resources is appropriate finally has to be 
tested by market share through economic operation. 
  The above discussion is based on a market economy in the 
context of large-scale socialized production. This includes a 
developed market system (incorporating production element 
markets) and subjects of operation with independent 
decisionmaking power. To achieve market mechanism-led 
utilization of resources, our country naturally should create 
the necessary conditions, so that it will not end up being 
nothing more than empty talk. 
<H5>  Market Economy Under Macroregulation and Control </H5>
  In the context of a market economy, microeconomic units 
always conduct their respective disposition of resources in 
accordance with the requirements of supply and demand on the 
market. Generally speaking, this will roughly lead to a 
balanced relationship between supply and demand and therefore 
lead the social economy to develop in a normal way. However, a 
market economy is all-powerful, because disposition of 
resources, after all, reflects human social behavior. It is 
inevitable that operators engage themselves in blind competition 
in pursuit of greatest profits and give rise to a state of 
anarchy, which in turn lead to market mistakes, loss of market 
effectiveness, and even economic crisis. 
  In today's China, 
some blind worshippers of the market economy believe that men 
are rational and rationalization of the utilization of resources 
can be achieved with the "invisible hand." This assumption is 
probably too naive. In fact, this theory was long ago falsified 
by the experience of capitalist market economies. In modern 
times, since Keynesian theory appeared, state intervention in 
market economies in capitalist society has been a widely 
accepted fact. Even before this, as Samuelson, an authority on 
capitalist economics, put it, a capitalist market economy had 
never reached the realm of total laissez-faire. Since the late 
19th century, in almost all countries, the role of government in 
the economy has been increasing. Today, all countries 
practicing a market economy see state intervention as a routine 
practice. For example, the United States, known for its 
capitalist freedom, also conducts macroregulation and control on 
its market economy through legal means, such as taxes and import 
restrictions. Germany follows the mode of a social market. 
Japan's economy is industrial policy-led, "manipulating the 
economic lever with a visible hand," and is a 
government-coordinated market economy. Since 1955, Japan has 
drawn up 12 medium- and long-term economic plans and has now 
begun to implement an economic development strategy for moving 
into the 21st century. France practices what is called 
"planned" market economy. Since World War II, France has never 
stopped making analytic and prognostic plans and controlling its 
economy with plans. As to the so-called "Asia-Pacific mode" of 
the market economy, like that in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, 
and Singapore, the strength of its macrocontrol is even greater. 
This was the very basis on which their economic takeoff was 
established. Naturally, however, all countries and regions 
practicing macroregulation and control follow the principle of 
not infringing on the role of market mechanism and their purpose 
is to increase orderliness in the market and reduce blindness in 
market competition. Our country's socialist market economy is 
naturally no exception in exercising macrocontrol, which is also 
an integral part of the socialist market economic system. 
  The socialist market economic system is one under a 
socialist 
system. A socialist country should naturally take advantage of 
the strengths of market mechanisms to promote the development 
and prosperity of social economy. But in the meantime, it 
should also use "a visible hand" to minimize blindness in market 
competition and solve problems that cannot be solved with market 
mechanisms alone. The intrinsic characteristic of a socialist 
economy is the public ownership of the means of production. 
Generally speaking, microeconomic units based on public 
ownership should be receptive to state guidance to reduce 
blindness in economic development. However, the reality is not 
that simple. Because our market development is far from perfect 
and market legislation and standards have yet to be established 
or improved, such phenomena as plunging into hot fields in 
swarms, blind investment, reckless starting of projects, and 
overlapping production keep happening. This shows that the task 
of macroregulation and control in our country is indeed an 
arduous one and will take a long time to accomplish and that the 
establishment and improvement of a macroregulation and control 
system is truly the top priority. 
  As to the macroregulation and control system, the "Decision" 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
pointed out that it is necessary to establish a mechanism that 
coordinates planning, banking, and finance, so that overall 
plans can be made. It also gave clear instructions on their 
respective functions, which will not be repeated in this 
article. Here, I would like to discuss only the issue of how to 
understand the great significance of macroregulation and control. 
  Some people have a very incomplete understanding of 
macroregulation and control, thinking that it is like "treating 
the head for a headache and the foot for a footache," i.e., 
making adjustments wherever there is a problem. There is no 
denying that it is necessary to find a specific remedy for any 
problem that crops up in the economy and try to solve it. 
However, this is not everything about the important value of 
macroregulation and control. Take for example the disposition of 
resources under macroregulation and control. Before 
microeconomic units have even done this, there is no knowing 
where the disease is. At this point, should we treat the head 
or the foot? Thus it seems that the important value of 
macroregulation and control should be realized with the 
government establishing an overall control target for 
socio-economic development and subsequently pointing out the 
right direction of development for microeconomic units even 
before the latter begin their disposition of resources. 
  The so-called control target, to put it in a nutshell, 
refers 
to the definition of what to encourage and what to restrict in a 
country's development and the definition of what necessary 
economic policies and measures to adopt toward the encouraged or 
restricted industrial sectors. The publication of this target 
should guide microeconomic units to conduct their own 
disposition of resources and economic activities with this as 
the beacon and road sign. In fact, when economic operation runs 
into problems, a country's macroregulation and control should 
also be conducted with this set target as criterion and 
yardstick. It is in no way an aimless, no-principle practice of 
"treating the head for a headache and the foot for a footache." 
It goes without saying that the control target for on-going 
economic development is also based on the market economy. 
However, though it comes from market realities, it is higher 
than this. In other words, it has gone through distillation and 
become a beacon for the development of market economy. 
  Macroregulation and Control and Planned Management 
  The development of socialist market economy is based on 
market mechanisms and led by macroregulation and control. The 
two elements are mutually complementary and bring out the best 
in each other. Together, they promote social and economic 
development and prosperity. In the past, some people had too 
many doubts and worries about commodity and market economies, a 
fear of slipping down the capitalist road. In fact, the 
intrinsic distinction between socialism and capitalism lies in 
the difference of ownership and distribution systems. But a 
market economy is a shared form of economic operation in the 
context of large-scale socialized production. 
  Since the beginning of reform and opening up, people have 
changed and gradually improved their understanding of the 
importance of commodity and market economies. But some people 
are dreaming of a laissez-faire market economy and lack a 
correct understanding of the necessity of macroeconomic control 
and planned management in the development of market economy, as 
if planning is something that should be done away with. Some 
people are frightened of the thought of planning, avoid talking 
about it, and even play down its significance, for fear of a 
resurgence of "planning." 
  Before reform started, there were indeed many mistakes in 
our 
planning system and work, such as excessive, overly strict, and 
overly rigid controls, centralism, pushing through of mandatory 
plans, and acting on administrative orders. As a result, the 
planned economy became a command and monopoly economy, with the 
euphemistic epithet of "the superiority of a planned economy" 
which gave a sense of pride. Back in the 1920's, Lenin warned 
that "the biggest danger is to bureaucratize the issue of state 
economic planning.... The complete, all-inclusive, and true 
planning equals `bureaucratic fantasy.' Do not pursue this kind 
of fantasy." Regrettably, however, our mistake happened to be 
the pursuit of this kind of fantasy and we happened to commit 
the mistake of this "biggest danger." Our reform in planning is 
to eliminate this planning system, in which "bureaucracy kills," 
and the many long-standing maladies deriving from it. It does 
not mean we do not need planning any more. 
  By suggesting that the future society should have planning, 
Marx meant that it was necessary to use planned, organized 
production to replace the state of anarchy so that proportionate 
and orderly social and economic development could be maintained. 
He did not mention how to implement this idea specifically. 
Lenin said: Any plan is a yardstick, criterion, beacon, road 
sign, and so on and so forth. In our reform, we must firmly and 
thoroughly eliminate all maladies of the old planning system. 
But this does not mean we do not need planning. We must not 
throw out the baby with the bath water. 
  In the past two years, authorities at all levels have been 
emphasizing macroregulation and control. This is perfectly 
correct. In my opinion, macroregulation-control and planned 
management are "one and the same." All the tasks related to 
macroregulation and control, such as the balance of total supply 
and demand, structural optimization, and development speed, are 
part of economic planning. As pointed out in the "Decision" of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
planning means "determining a strategy for national economic and 
social development, the targets of macroregulation and control, 
and industrial policies; doing a good job in economic 
forecasting; and designing major economic structures, the 
pattern of distribution of productive forces, national land 
improvement and development, and key construction projects." 
This shows that macroregulation and control is based on 
macroplanning and macroregulation and control targets. If 
planned regulation is a means, the role of planning, the 
"visible hand," is brought it into play by macroregulation and 
control. One can see from the "Decision" that for 
macroregulation and control, its function in facing the society, 
mobilizing forces, and executing tasks in the economic forefront 
should be emphasized, while for planning, its function as an 
economic advisory sector of a macrostrategic and policy nature 
should be highlighted. 
  The planned management of our country since reform began has 
been mainly medium-term and long-term planning, focusing on 
guidance and coordination. The macroregulation and control 
system comprises planning, banking, and finance, all of which 
are concerned with overall interests. However, banking and 
finance aim at giving play to their respective roles in monetary 
credit, fiscal, and taxation fields. It is planning and 
planning alone which oversees the overall development of the 
economy, and brings together and coordinates economic relations 
among various quarters. The planning organ is a brain trust and 
the designing institute of social-economic development, which 
draws grand blueprints. Accomplishing this important task 
requires the guidance of superior political-economic ideas and 
scientific viewpoints. The crux of the matter is that the 
subjective should correctly or relatively correctly reflect the 
objective, and subjective initiative should be integrated with 
objective law in an organic way. 
  As far as short-term 
planning is concerned, it is naturally necessary to be led by 
market mechanisms and to base planning on the law of value, 
i.e., referring to market information, determining parameters, 
making forecasts, and formulating rational and feasible 
macroplans. I must point out here that state macroplanning is 
not a simple simulation of the market. For instance, the 
industrial structure and infrastructure are designed by the 
state by considering the overall needs of social-economic 
development and are for the purpose of showing enterprises the 
right way to go in their development. As to medium- and 
long-term planning, it is even less likely that a solution could 
be found by merely relying on market mechanisms. 
  Medium- and long-term plans should also proceed from the 
current market economy and result in future economic development 
forecasts, but the market cannot throw much light on the 
long-term future. Furthermore, a market economy arouses the 
initiative of people in competing for benefits, but low-profit 
or nonprofit undertakings will not receive any attention. State 
macroplanning, on the other hand, must consider the needs of 
overall social development. Medium- and long-term planning for a 
number of years to come mainly serves the purpose of 
establishing the orientation and goal of strategic development. 
Therefore, it is imperative to stand high and see far by taking 
into account the domestic and international political and 
economic situations, analyze and predict their trends and 
changes, and use them as the basis for formulating medium- and 
long-term plans. Such plans should cover unified arrangement 
for the balance of total supply and demand; optimization of the 
industrial structure; rationalization of distribution of 
productive forces; development of high and new-technology; 
establishment of new industries; attaching importance to such 
soft infrastructural facilities as scientific research and 
education, while attending to such hard infrastructural 
facilities as energy and communications; showing concern for 
ecological balance and the protection and improvement of 
environment; fair distribution; social welfare undertakings; and 
so on and so forth. These grand and long-term strategies are 
both plans and policies. Only when decisionmaking is built on 
the basis of science and democracy can its feasibility and 
effectiveness be enhanced. When a medium- or long-term plan is 
broken down to yearly plans for implementation, it should 
naturally be specified in light of the current market needs. 
The implementation of macroplans, which are usually of a 
guiding nature, requires the cooperation of microunits. All 
this should be standardized by way of legislation. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The development of a socialist market economy should be 
subjected to macroregulation, macrocontrols and planned 
management to improve its orderliness. However, fundamentally 
speaking, it depends on the perfection and development of the 
market system, in particular, the establishment and improvement 
of the production elements market. If this market fails to 
developed, the so-called market mechanism-led utilization of 
resources will be a bubble. In the meantime, it is also 
imperative to decontrol prices, because adjustments in market 
mechanisms are signalled by price changes. Controlled and 
distorted prices cannot reflect the true developments of market 
mechanisms. 
  The subjects of enterprise operations in the behavior of a 
market economy should be independent economic legal persons 
which make decisions for themselves. Only such operational 
subjects have the courage to go all out to come to the top in 
market competition. Therefore, the state must, instead of making 
promises only, truly let state-owned enterprises become 
independent economic entities with decisionmaking power. 
Without true enterprises, a true market economy is not 
possible. In the meantime, with regard to enterprises operating 
at a loss, the state should stop the absurd practice of taking 
infinite responsibility for all losses. And, if they fail to 
end loss-making and begin profit-making, leaders of enterprises 
which suffer from losses caused by mismanagement should be 
subjected to the punishment that they deserve. Only by so doing 
can enterprises "responsible for profits, but not for losses," 
come back onto the right track. After ownership and management 
authority are separated, no government at any level can 
interfere in routine enterprise operations and management. 
Legal responsibility should be affixed for those who abuse 
their powers and arbitrarily interfere. (See "Regulations on 
Changing the Operational Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises 
Under Ownership by the Whole People") The state is the owner of 
state-owned enterprise property; the government manages and 
supervises them on behalf of the state and collects profits in 
proportion to the volume of investment. This is actually 
performance of investor duties, not exercising state power. In 
the past, those two were confused. Now, such confusion should 
be put right. In my opinion, this is not a matter of changing 
government functions. It is high time we stopped incorrectly 
drawing a parallel between investor functions and the exercise 
of state power. I would like to say in passing that the general 
management functions performed by the state toward the social 
economy, such as taxation, industrial and commercial 
administration, macroregulation and control, and planning and 
guidance apply to both non-state-owned and state-owned 
enterprises. There is no question of changing functions. 
  In short, we must create necessary conditions for the 
development of a socialist market economy and conduct necessary 
macroregulation-control and guidance to standardize the market 
economy and enable it to operate in an orderly way. This way, 
the market will be active and the economy prosperous, 
increasingly so by the year.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Analysis and Forecast of China's </F>
Economic Situation in 1994"] 
  [Text] How will China's economy develop in 1994? 
  Economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences 
[CASS] 
and the State Statistics Bureau made their analyses and 
forecasts a few days ago. 
  This so-called "Spring Report," based on an analysis and 
forecast of China's economic situation in 1994, was made by a 
study group presided over by Liu Guoguang, former president and 
now guest adviser to the CASS, and led by Li Jingwen, director 
of the CASS Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics, 
and Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist in the State Statistics Bureau. 
The group was comprised of many economic researchers from the 
CASS and the State Statistics Bureau. 
  It is considered by international economic circles as a 
comparatively advanced method of analysis and forecast to use 
the means of combining modelization with positivist analysis to 
forecast the macroeconomic trend. The study group, which uses 
this method to analyze and forecast the economic situation in 
our country, divides its analysis and forecast into a "Spring 
Report" and a "Fall Report." 
  "The Overall Measure for Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control 
in 1994," carried in the last issue of this magazine put forward 
suggestions on the basis of last year's "Fall Report." The main 
points of the study group's "Spring Report" on the trend in 
economic development in 1994 are as follows: 
<H5>  The Main Characteristics of China's Economic Development in </H5>
1994 
  In 1994, our country will maintain a considerably fast 
economic growth rate but the macroeconomic regulation and 
control will also face fairly serious problems. Generally, the 
economic development this year will have the following main 
characteristics: 
  After two successive years of rapid growth, the speed of our 
economic growth rate will tend to slow down but the fall will 
not be too big. The economy will maintain its momentum for 
fairly high growth throughout the year and it is expected that 
the GDP will grow by 11.5 percent. The seasonal growth this 
year will tend to be fast at first and then it will slow down. 
Viewed from the growth structure of industries, the added 
values of the primary industry, secondary industry and the 
tertiary industry will rise by 3.5, 16, and 10.5 percent 
respectively. The gap between the growth in the tertiary 
industry and the growth of GDP will further narrow. This will 
be advantageous to the rationalization of the industrial 
structure. 
  It is necessary to maintain a fairly fast economic growth 
rate in 1994. 
  First, it will help avoid major fluctuations in the economic 
development, limit the effect of shocks caused by cyclical 
fluctuations of the economy, maintain the stability of economic 
development, and maintain the situation of social stability and 
unity. 
  Second, a complementary relationship exists between the 
vigorous development of infrastructure and basic industries and 
the maintenance of a fairly fast economic growth rate. Basic 
industries cannot depend solely on stock adjustments to increase 
their supply capacity but must chiefly depend on investment to 
increase new supply capacity. This requires that the economy 
grow at a considerably high speed to supply funds and materials. 
It is only when the "bottleneck" restriction of the basic 
industries is alleviated that the economy can maintain rapid 
development. 
  Third, it is also necessary to maintain a fairly high 
economic growth rate, especially in the comparatively backward 
and poor areas in central and western China, to improve the 
uneven economic development between areas and narrow the income 
differences between residents in various walks of life. 
  Fourth, given that China relies chiefly on speed to obtain 
efficiency, only by maintaining a fairly rapid economic growth 
rate is it possible to ensure a steady increase in residents' 
incomes and constantly improve the people's living standards. 
  Fifth, the world is "upbeat about China." In 1993, actual 
use of foreign funds increased by 91.5 percent while direct 
foreign investment increased by 130 percent. A sharp decrease 
in the economic growth rate will affect the introduction of 
foreign funds. 
  The possibility exists of maintaining a fairly rapid growth 
rate in our economy. 
  First, the deepening reform has provided a better 
environment 
in terms of economic structure. The development of economic 
sectors under different systems of ownership has strengthened 
the vitality of the whole economy. 
  Second, in 1993, infrastructural construction developed 
fairly quickly, with communications and post and 
telecommunications doubling and redoubling and the production 
output of basic industries increasing fairly rapidly. With 
great increases in state investment in basic industries and a 
fairly quick development of the national economy for several 
years in succession, the "bottleneck" sectors have strengthened 
their adaptability to the speedy development of the national 
economy. Consequently, their restriction has been alleviated 
and will be further alleviated. 
  Third, the nearly 2,000 billion yuan investment in fixed 
assets in 1992 and 1993 will gradually develop into productive 
capacity and consequently improve the supply condition. 
  Fourth, in 1993, per-capita income of residents in cities 
and 
towns increased by 10.2 percent, that of rural residents 
increased by 3.2 percent, and investment in fixed assets on a 
society-wide scale actually increased by 22 percent. In 1994 
the income of the residents and investment will remain at a 
rather high level. This will increase social demand and make it 
possible for the economy to grow quite rapidly. 
  However, the analysis of the necessity and possibility 
of maintaining a comparatively fast economic growth rate is only 
one side of the problem. Under the current situation wherein 
the pressure of inflation is quite serious, we should be 
flexibly in coordinating the objective of controlling inflation 
with the objective of maintaining a fast economic growth rate 
and strictly prevent the occurrence of malignant inflation 
brought about by the blind pursuit of high growth rates by 
localities. 
  Investment Remains the Chief Impetus For Pushing 
Economic Growth Ahead in 1994 
  In 1994, investment will remain the chief impetus to push 
economic growth ahead. The growth rate of investment will still 
outstrip that of the GDP. It is estimated that the total 
societywide investment in fixed assets for the year will reach 
1,500 billion yuan, an increase of 27 percent or an actual 
increase of about 12 percent. 
  The growth in investment scale will slow down but it is 
still 
necessary to maintain moderate investment. The main reasons are 
as follows: 
  First, the maintenance of a certain scale of society-wide 
investment in fixed assets is highly necessary for the 
realization of a stable transition of the national economy. It 
will help prevent the occurrence of economic slide and the 
intensification of the contradictions between the general supply 
and general demand. 
  Second, in 1993, the total society-wide investment in fixed 
assets increased by 50.6 percent, the highest increase since the 
reform and opening to the outside world began. However, because 
the construction scale was over-extended and the funds were far 
from being made available, the commissioning rate of investment 
in fixed assets was only 47 percent last year, the lowest for 
the past 10 years and more. Under such circumstances it is 
necessary to maintain a moderate investment scale. Any method 
of major retrenchment or big cuts will be inappropriate and 
cause bigger losses, mainly because it will weaken market demand 
and increase sedimented funds. 
  Third, in terms of investment structure, in 1993, with the 
exception of communications and telecommunications, the 
proportion of investment decreased in those weak sectors that 
needed to be strengthened urgently, such as agriculture, energy, 
and raw materials. It was the lowest since the reform and 
opening to the outside world began. To ensure funds can be 
concentrated for the development of the "bottleneck" sectors and 
to carry out structural readjustment in an active way, it is 
also necessary to maintain a moderate scale of investment. The 
stress of investment in 1994 should be laid on structural 
readjustment and the strengthening of the weak links to reduce 
losses and optimize the structure. 
  Fourth, after the rectification of the financial order in 
1993, the monetary system itself has a lot of overstored 
currency. By the end of 1993, the provision rate [bei fu jin lu 
0271 0102 6855 3764] of specialized banks in the central bank 
was as high as 11.9 percent. Besides, the pressure of 
increasing currency issues will no longer aggravate because of 
the reform of the tax system and the implementation of the new 
system of financial revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the 
banking financial system has the credit capability to support a 
moderate investment scale. 
  Fifth, although there are still deficits in foreign trade 
the 
cash balance has increased, thus increasing the room for 
maneuver. 
  However, one problem that cannot be neglected is that 
the scale of investment has become the most fundamental root 
cause of the pressure of inflation. The problem now is not how 
to make investment up to a moderate scale but how to control 
investment within a moderate scale. This requires that we 
should control the force of macroeconomic regulation and control 
appropriately and implement the financial, monetary, and fiscal 
policies correctly, while accelerating reform of the investment 
structure. So long as finance is not out of control, that is, 
the issue of new currency does not exceed 160 billion yuan and 
the scale of newly added loans does not exceed 550 billion yuan, 
the scale of investment in fixed assets will not be out of 
control. 
<H5>  The Main Characteristics of the Current Inflation in Our </H5>
Country 
  Since the last quarter of 1993, the price levels of our 
country have shown a continuous tendency to rise. Since the 
beginning of 1994, the situation has tended to be more serious. 
In the first quarter of the year, the national retail price 
index increased by 20.1 percent over the same period last year. 
The central government has taken various measures to restrain 
the momentum of rocketing price hikes. 
  Since March, price increases have tended to slow down. 
According to predictions, the commodity retail price index for 
the whole year will rise by 13.2 percent while the cost of 
living index for the residents will rise by about 14.5 percent. 
The increase rate will generally be the same as last year or a 
bit higher. The price index of investment goods will rise by 
about 15 percent, lower than last year. 
  If we do not restrain excessive price increases quickly, 
this 
will hamper the reform, affect development, and also cause 
social instability. So, the price problem can by no means be 
treated lightly. We should analyze the causes of excessive 
price increases so as to take corresponding measures. On the 
other hand, we should flexibly coordinate-ordinate price control 
with the maintenance of a rapid economic growth rate. 
  From the beginning of reform and opening to the outside 
world 
in 1979 up to 1993, the average annual economic growth rate was 
9.3 percent while the annual rate of inflation was 6.4 percent. 
This situation was very satisfactory. However, in 1993 the 
inflation rate almost equalled the economic growth rate and, in 
1994, there has surfaced the danger that the inflation rate will 
exceed the growth rate of the economy. So, the primary task of 
macroeconomic regulation and control at present is to balance 
rationally the maintenance of rapid economic growth and the 
control of inflation so that the national economy can grow at a 
considerably high speed and the inflation can be controlled at a 
comparatively low level. 
  There have been obvious changes in the operating mechanism 
and the level of economic development of our country and the 
changes are still going on. In the course of the changes, the 
occurrence of inflation to a certain degree is the price we must 
pay for the realization of the reform and economic development. 
However, the present inflation has exceeded the normal scope. 
Its chief characteristics are: First, prices rise at the same 
pace both in cities and rural areas; second, the increase in 
service prices exceeds that in consumer prices; and third, the 
hefty price increases of daily necessities have caused strong 
dissatisfaction among residents. On the other hand, the problem 
of delinquency among enterprises is getting more serious and the 
stocks of certain goods keep increasing. The signs indicating 
that the cycle of economic operation is not smooth have emerged. 
  These contradictory phenomena are worth our notice. 
  There are various causes of the abovementioned abnormal 
phenomena. The direct causes which triggered excessive inflation 
in the first quarter of 1994 are mainly as follows: 
  First, in 1993 prices rose because the investment and credit 
scales exceeded those planned and the structural price 
adjustments and price liberalization were carried out in a very 
big way. The aftereffects will bring the commodity retail price 
index up by 5 to 6 percentage points. 
  Second, the nationwide grain price fluctuation which spread 
from south to north at the end of 1993 gave the impetus to hefty 
price increases. At the same time, the decision to raise the 
purchase prices of grain and cotton in 1994 also had a certain 
effect. 
  Third, the personnel and salary reforms in the public 
servants system had the social effect of causing price increases 
to a certain degree. 
  Fourth, although the implementation of the new tax system 
does not affect the total tax revenue very much, most of the 28 
percent of the enterprises on which added tax are levied produce 
goods in short supply. The prices of their goods will therefore 
rise while the prices of goods produced by the 26 percent of the 
enterprises that have their taxes deducted are not reduced. 
Moreover, in the actual implementation of the new tax system, 
there have been instances of distorting the tax system and 
causing abnormal price increases. 
  Fifth, when the foreign exchange rates were unified at the 
beginning of 1994, the single exchange rate was at first higher 
than the weighted average exchange rate before the unification. 
Consequently, the actual price rose on the foreign exchange 
market. 
  Moreover, another factor which should receive attention is: 
As the old system of planned economy is being transformed into 
a new system of market economy, the traditional closed economy 
is transformed into a modern, open economy; the management, with 
administration playing a leading role, is transformed into one 
wherein the legal system plays a leading role; 
microinflexibility is transformed into microflexibility; and 
families with low incomes are changing into well-to-do and rich 
ones. Especially with the change from state price controls over 
most commodities to the liberalization of price controls over 
more than 95 percent of commodities, the interest principals in 
China are becoming increasingly diversified. So, before the 
establishment of a perfect market price management system, 
prices have become the important means through which different 
interest principals make profits. For a period of time, 
unstandardized phenomena such as arbitrarily raising prices, 
driving up prices, and willfully raising prices by monopolistic 
businesses will inevitably become more serious because 
management of the market cannot follow up immediately. 
  The present price increases are not simply double 
inflation but are of a comprehensive type. To deal with this, 
we should not only depend on the control of supply and demand, 
especially control of excessive investment scale, but we should 
also supervise and control the practice of driving up prices and 
profiteering, establish a sound legal system, and order the 
market economy. We should change the situation in which the 
strength for price reform is strong, whereas the strength for 
price management is weak, and raise the work level of the 
government in controlling and keeping down prices. 
<H5>  Analysis of the Trend of Economic Development in 1994 </H5>
  The "Fall Report" of 1993 predicted that there would be 
three 
possible futures for the development of China's economy. First, 
if the strength of the macroeconomic regulation and control is 
handled properly then the momentum of the "overheated" economy 
will be controlled, the inflation rate will begin to drop, and 
the growth rate of the economy will also drop to about 10 
percent. Second, if the strength of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control is too strong or the retrenchment is 
excessive, the economic growth will lose too much speed and the 
economic "hard landing" will occur. Third, if the deep-rooted 
contradictions which impede the healthy development of the 
economy are not settled the macroeconomic regulation and control 
will be loosened in haste, amid the complaints about "funds 
shortages" by local authorities and enterprises. Consequently, 
the economic growth rate will regain its speed too early so that 
inflation will be rekindled. 
  The economic situation in recent months indicates that the 
third result has occurred. So, stronger measures have to be 
taken and the danger of their leading to the second result still 
exists but it is possible for us to strive to achieve the first 
result. 
  According to a positive analysis of the relationship between 
the development of the national economy and the price increases, 
generally, the abovementioned first and third results can be 
described quantitatively as follows: If the economic growth 
rate and the rate of price increases are basically kept at the 
same level in 1994, the GDP growth rate is 9 percent and the 
price increases are controlled beneath 10 percent, then the 
first positive result will be achieved. In view of the present 
actual situation, if the growth rate of the GDP is 11 to 12 
percent and the retail price index rises by about 13 percent, it 
will still be a considerably positive result. If the price 
increase rate exceeds the economic growth rate by over 5 
percent, as it did in 1988 when prices rose by 18.5 percent 
while the growth of the GDP was 11.3 percent, then we can judge 
that the economy has deviated from its normal development. 
  So, one of the emphases in the economic work of 1994 is to 
achieve coordination and balance between economic growth and 
price controls. We should understand that the price raise, to a 
certain extent, is unavoidable in the course of the reform and 
that it is the cost we should pay for the reform. However, we 
should also note that price increases should be controlled 
within the scope sustainable by the people and society to create 
conditions to push the reform ahead and maintain a considerably 
fast economic growth rate. 
  We can say that both opportunities and risks exist in 1994. 
If we fail to control both the investment and credit scales, 
even if the economic growth rate rises by one or two percentage 
points, the loss will outweigh the gain if the prices rise by 20 
percent for the whole year. Eventually, it will lead the 
development of our national economy to a trough, seriously 
affecting the course of establishing a socialist market economy. 
If we do a good job in 1994, we can expect that economic 
development will further approach the expected goal of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. The growth rate of the 
GDP will be around 10 percent while the growth rate of 
investment will drop to around 20 percent and the price 
increases will be controlled at around 10 percent. Our economic 
development will further follow a steady upward course.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Yingqiu (0491 6601 4428): "Choice of </F>
Policies To Curb Inflation"] 
  [Text] Since the government adopted a series of measures 
to control commodity prices last March, the price raises have 
been eased to a certain extent. By comparing the figure for the 
first quarter of this year with the same period last year, 
however, one can see that the country's general retail price 
index still increased by 20.1 percentage points. Such a 
situation tells us that China is currently faced with fairly 
high inflation pressure and should promptly formulate effective 
countermeasures in order to curb inflation and maintain a high 
economic growth rate. 
<H5>  Special Features of Current Inflation </H5>
  Statistics clearly show that the inflation which began in 
the 
latter half of 1993 differs greatly from the two previous 
periods of inflation which occurred from the fourth quarter of 
1984 to 1985 and in the year 1988. The following are three 
major features of the current inflation: 1. Instead of 
starting with the production and circulation of downstream 
products, the current inflation first began with upstream 
products and then spread to downstream products. 2. The current 
inflation has neither led to "panic buying" in society nor 
disturbed the relative tranquility of the consumption field. 
What it has caused is "the glinting and flashing of cold steel" 
in the production and the circulation of the means of 
production. 3. During the current inflation, the fastest rise 
has been registered in the producer prices of industrial goods, 
not in the purchasing prices of agricultural and sideline 
products. These three distinguishing features are clear proof 
that the current inflation is pushed by costs on the basis of an 
imperfect structure. 
  In view of the three major features of China's current 
inflation, as well as the general characteristics of cost-push 
inflation, we know very well when choosing curbing measures that 
it is not enough to just adopt the policy of currency control as 
we did before. 
<H5>  Curbing Inflation Should Start With Structural Reform </H5>
  Since the structure still remains the primary cause of the 
current inflation, we should continue to take the deepening of 
structural reform as the point of departure. Starting with 
structural reform is a long-term measure of fundamental 
importance for curbing inflation. 
  We should focus our attention on the following two problems: 
The first problem is how to define the property rights of 
enterprises and how to reorganize and establish a modern 
enterprise system; and the second is how to define things that 
the government should or should not do, that is, the problem of 
how to define the functions of the government. If we can find 
satisfactory answers to these two problems, we can certainly 
find a fundamental way to curb the "impulse for expansion" in 
enterprises and a fundamental cure for inflation which is 
brought about by mutual impediments caused by both the 
irrational government structure and the improper behavior of 
local governments. 
  To answer the first problem, an important task is to reform 
the existing management system for state-owned assets, establish 
new property rights relations for state-owned assets, and bring 
changes to the foundaton of the soft restriction system on the 
state-owned economy capital. A basic problem which has never 
been properly solved since the beginning of reform is that the 
property rights of state-owned enterprises exist in name only. 
The following are two major causes for such nominal property 
rights: The first is the imperfect property rights system in 
enterprises. Instead of fortifying the state-owned property 
rights, the contracted system has actually weakened, to a 
certain extent, the restrictive power of state-owned property 
rights over the behavior of enterprises. A concrete 
manifestation of this weakened restrictive power is the 
short-term nature of the behavior in contracted enterprises. 
Workers are the main body of an enterprise with the entrepreneur 
at the core. If the entrepreneur is squeezed out of the 
enterprise's property rights system, it will become unavoidable 
that the property rights of the enterprise are but an empty 
shell. The second cause is the unclear definition of the 
property rights in enterprises. When this is the case, the 
property rights of state-owned enterprises will inevitably 
become nothing but ornaments. Therefore, without solving the 
problem of defining the property rights of state-owned 
enterprises, we can neither find any solution to the problem 
that the property rights of enterprises exist in name only nor 
can we establish an agent system for state property rights. The 
property rights agents we are talking about here must include 
not only agents at the national level but also those at four 
other levels, namely, the provincial, city (prefectural), 
county, and townships levels. Otherwise, inflation resulting 
from the distorted behavior of enterprises will also be 
unavoidable. 
  To find an answer to the second problem, one of our basic 
countermeasures in the present stage is to change the contents 
of and methods employed in the assessment of work results of 
local governments. This means that, in a thoroughgoing manner, 
we should change the orientation of assessing work results from 
stressing only the pace of economic development and the 
per-capita income of the local area to stressing whether or not 
the local area has paid enough attention to the construction of 
urban and rural basic facilities, to providing services for the 
production and operation of enterprises, and to improving the 
functions and efficiency of government services. When it comes 
to relations between the central and local authorities, our 
emphasis on a shift from administrative decentralization to 
economic decentralization will inevitably lead to the situation 
wherein inflation is triggered by the behavior of local 
governments. This also means that, as a feasible 
countermeasure, a major task which should be fulfilled by both 
the central and local authorities is to change the functions of 
the government in real terms.

Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic 
Structure" gives a comprehensive and brilliant exposition on the 
basic framework of China's banking structural reform. It can be 
said that the road is already open now for China's banking 
reform. In the present stage, what counts is to decide on 
necessary measures and appropriate plans in light of the new 
situations cropping up during our economic practice and the new 
problems we have confronted during the process of reform, seize 
all favorable opportunities, and to develop a comprehensive 
reform of the banking system, step by step. To this end, we 
need to study ways to unify interest rates for renminbi savings 
deposits and loans in accordance with the objective demands of 
the modern market economic development on the basis of 
unification of the renminbi exchange rate; through open market 
businesses and discounts and rediscounts, we can hopefully reach 
the goal of successfully readjusting the direction of capital 
flow, keeping inefficient loans under control, optimizing the 
investment pattern, bringing about a balanced market supply and 
demand, and eliminating inflation. 
  Another task which needs to be fulfilled in improving the 
management of the banking market in the present stage is to 
acquire a new understanding of how to control the credit line. 
In line with the inherent logic of the market economic 
development, we should reduce the credit line to a minimum as 
soon as possible so that we can base the principal management 
means of China's finances mainly on market signals. 
  Since we should undoubtedly retain a certain number of 
production and operational projects which are run exclusively by 
the state within a certain scope, both at present and in the 
future, we need to continue exercising credit line control over 
a certain amount of investment capital to a certain extent. On 
the other hand, if we fail to equally impose a flat interest 
rate on all major economic bodies (except those run exclusively 
by the state), it will be difficult to find any effective ways 
to prevent swollen investment and recurring inflation caused by 
the former. 
<H5>  While Rectifying Market Trade Order, We Should Put the Brake </H5>
Firmly on the Practice of Arbitrarily Raising Prices in the 
Production Fields 
  This will indeed be a workable short-term countermeasure for 
curbing inflation. Under a chaotic market trade order, venture 
capital can also play the role of jacking up prices and inducing 
inflation under certain conditions and during certain periods, 
thus fanning the flames of disorder. Therefore, we must 
strictly rectify the market trade order, including the order in 
the banking, securities, real estate, property rights, and 
futures markets, with a view to enhancing the operational 
efficiency of the market, reducing the costs of social dealings, 
and expanding the coverage of social welfare. Meanwhile, we 
should also realize, with a sober mind, that this is not really 
a permanent cure. It can thus be seen that without the basis of 
chaotic behavior in productive enterprises, it is impossible for 
the chaotic market trade order to last for a long period of 
time. That is to say, to get at the root of this problem we 
must first rectify the behavior in productive enterprises. 
  The below-standard behavior of China's enterprises is 
closely 
related to the existing enterprise structure which recognizes 
the operational autonomy of enterprises on the one hand and 
suffers from unclear enterprise property relations on the other. 
Apart from this, enterprises are also encumbered with "internal 
diseconomy" and "external diseconomy," including serious 
protracted problems known to all. For example, enterprises are 
plagued by surplus personnel; social welfare projects they have 
undertaken; retired personnel, for whom they have to provide 
housing and other welfare benefits; the schooling and employment 
of the children of their employees; arbitrary collections of 
charges and fees; and by difficulties they have encountered when 
getting things done. Under the situation wherein enterprises 
are operated at a low efficuency, or even without efficiency, 
their only choice is to "raise prices," for "price-raising" is 
the cheapest and least costly thing for them to do. That is how 
prices increase as enterprises follow each other's example and 
compete with one another (in the pursuit of higher prices). To 
effect a permanent cure for the present situation, we should 
rectify not only the market trade order but the production and 
opertional order in enterprises, adopting radical measures to 
stop the trend of raising prises among enterprises. 
  Of course, apart from the aforementioned several basic 
countermeasures, there are also other indispensable measures for 
the rectification, including readjusting industrial and 
import-export policies; coordinating credit policies with 
taxation policies; encouraging the production and import of 
low-price commodities and the construction of residential houses 
and private cars; giving shape to more "hot spots for 
consumption"; and attracting more ready money from both urban 
and rural residents within a shorter time frame.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Alarm Over Food-Staple Prices"] </F>
  [Text] Believing that persistent price hikes for farm 
produce will continue to hinder efforts to control inflation, 
economists with the State Statistics Bureau are calling for 
prompt official action to rein in the spiralling prices of 
grain, edible oil and meat. 
  This continuous climb in prices jeopardizes the central 
government's campaign to reduce inflation in the country's 35 
major cities to 19 percent this coming December from 23.2 
percent in April. 
  The government's hopes for cooling inflation were fanned by 
a 
recent survey by the bureau's urban statistics team which found 
that prices were plummeting for machines, electronics and 
household electrical appliances. 
  But the prices of grain, edible oil and meat are still 
climbing. This poses a serious problem for the government, which 
must improve its control over prices if it is to achieve its 
economic target this year. 
  The survey found no signs that the upward trend in prices 
will reverse itself in the months ahead. 
  According to the bureau, grain prices rose in April by 3.8 
percent from March, and by 36.7 percent from April a year ago. 
  On free markets, a kilogram of rice now fetches between 1.70 
yuan (20 U.S. cents) and 2.20 yuan (25 cents), up 4.4 percent 
from the beginning of this year. 
  Prices are lower in State grain shops because of the 
government's stern pricing guidelines that are intended to 
stabilize the grain supply. But managers of these shops 
complain of unprecedented losses. 
  Because of a severe shortage, the prices of edible oil 
increased 55.8 percent in April from a year earlier. 
  Some local governments, worried that edible-oil prices may 
run beyond what residents can afford, are subsidizing grain 
shops and restricting consumer purchases by once again issuing 
coupons. 
  The average price of oil made from soya bean, rape seed and 
peanuts is now between 7 yuan (80 cents) and 9 yuan ($1) a 
kilogram, 0.6 yuan (7 cents) higher than at the start of this 
year. 
  The swelling costs of animal feed are also making various 
meat products more expensive, the bureau said. 
  Meat prices have climbed an average 33.4 percent from last 
year, the bureau said. 
  The setback in cotton production, meanwhile, is presenting a 
tough challenge to the government's efforts to control cloth and 
garment prices. 
  The bureau's figures show that prices for cotton cloth have 
persistently increased this year. In April, the year-on-year 
increase was 25.4 percent. 
  Analysts explain that side-effects of the pricing reform and 
the rocketing cost of production materials have combined to form 
the Achilles heel of the economy. 
  The government's lifting of price controls on grain and 
other 
consumer products last year created imponderable effects on the 
economy that are now being felt. Analysts do not expect the 
inflationary pressures to abate because of the persistent 
adverse factors that took shape in 1993.

  [Text] Despite the focus on China's loss-making 
enterprises, a survey by management consultants McKinsey and Co 
shows that the mainland's top three corporations in the key 
industries are as good as Asia's best performers. 
  "We've done some benchmarking by taking the most relevant 
competitors for the Chinese companies," said Trevor MacMurray, 
managing director of McKinsey's Hong Kong office. A comparison 
in the steel industry, for example, showed that the performance 
of the top three Chinese companies matched those of the top 
Asian competitors. Mr MacMurray predicted that some Chinese 
industrial names would make it big in the international arena in 
the next five to 10 years as they pursued aggressive overseas 
expansion. 
  McKinsey, which is working on a pilot project involving four 
key state enterprises in Shanghai and backed by the World Bank 
has done benchmarking for the energy, telecommunications, 
consumer goods and financial industries. 
  "Again, in the energy sector, the Chinese enterprises have 
good technical capability, particularly in exploration and 
production," said Mr MacMurray, adding that the problem the 
industry faced was the shortage of funds. He predicted that 
with the reforms of the state enterprises, China would 
ultimately have an industrial structure similar to those 
elsewhere, where the market was dominated by multiple players. 
  At present, there were many state enterprises producing 30 
or 
40 products to serve a local region rather than focusing on a 
few products which they could produce efficiently. The state 
enterprise reform meant they would have to run their own 
distribution and marketing system, which would force them to 
understand the pricing structure of products. Mr MacMurray said 
a difficult aspect of the reform was the separation of the 
corporations' social obligations. "The social costs can well be 
over a third of the total costs of running the business. As you 
can imagine, it has a lot of social implications, so it's not 
easy."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China--`A Train Which Advances Rapidly'"] </F>
  [Text] China's development situation greatly affects Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability, and the people of Hong Kong are 
very much concerned about the mainland's economic situation. 
  As indicated by several state leaders's recent remarks and 
by 
information provided by some authoritative departments, the 
present situation of the Chinese economy is good. What 
impressed us most is: The trend of rapid economic growth is 
still maintained this year despite a steady drop in the pace of 
growth, and the GDP in the first half of this year is expected 
to increase by approximately 12 percent over the same period of 
last year; the trend of reform is good, the several major reform 
measures introduced this year proceed smoothly despite arduous 
efforts made and the great difficulties met, the new system is 
running normally, and China has fully entered the new period of 
establishing a socialist market economic system; a good 
situation of opening up to the outside world, which is 
unprecedented, has emerged. China is opening up to every trade 
partner and has become one of the countries in the world with 
such ae great degree of opening up. A few days ago, on the 
basis of announcing the abolition of import administration for 
283 commodities late last year, China also relaxed restrictions 
on the import of 195 commodities. This year, China's foreign 
trade continues to grow at a full and high speed, and import and 
export volume in the first four months increased by 20 percent 
over the same period last year. 
  As for China's economic situation, the international 
community has, generally speaking, made very good comments on 
it. Not long ago, NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, a French weekly, 
published an article about impressions of China after visiting 
it, saying that "visitors are really startled by China's 
changes" and that in China, the "train has been set in motion, 
this is a train of reform and full-scale opening up which is 
advancing at a high speed." Sutherland, director-general of the 
GATT, said in admiration: "China's ambitious reform makes its 
economic system closer to the international trade system" and 
"the Chinese economy is undergoing eye-catchingly great 
changes." Even U.S. President Clinton also acknowledged not 
long ago that "last year, China was the country with the fastest 
economic growth in the world" and that "an economic entity 
belonging to the 21st century is gradually taking shape in 
China." 
  Hong Kong is linked by common mountains and rivers with the 
mainland, and the people of Hong Kong are more capable of 
noticing the mainland's constant changes and of listening to the 
mainland people's footsteps of making great strides. We may 
ponder on things which we see and hear or even personally 
experience and take part in. 
  In recent years, influential powers in the world have been 
trying every possible means to cooperate with China, and many 
globally renowned big enterprises have been vying with each 
other in marching into the market of China. What does it mean? 
It means that apart from having a vast market and an abundant 
supply of labor and raw and processed materials, more important 
is that the Chinese economy is growing at a quick pace, its 
investment environment has been improved greatly, and its 
domestic market is linking up with the international market step 
by step. These are precisely the results of China's reform. 
  As far as Hong Kong business investments in the mainland are 
concerned, areas of investment have been extended to interior 
provinces or even to border areas in the northwest, the focus of 
investment fields has shifted from tertiary industry to 
infrastructure construction, and the scale ranges from investing 
tens of thousands or several millions yuan in running an 
enterprise to investing billions or even 10 billions yuan in 
developing stretches of land in a city. Not long ago, three 
worldwide famed transnational companies based in Hong Kong--New 
World Development Company Limited, Sun Hung Kai Company Limited, 
and Henderson Land Development Company Limited, decided to 
jointly invest 15 billion yuan in rebuilding riverside urban 
districts and some obsolete industrial enterprises in Wuhan, 
which is inspiring. What does it mean? It means that China's 
economic situation is getting better and better, and China has 
increasingly strong power to attract foreign investment. 
  A number of Chinese state-owned enterprises have been 
successfully listed in Hong Kong. The first group of them are 
nine state-owned enterprises, which have issued a total of 5.5 
billion H-shares and raised 11.6 billion Hong Kong dollars of 
funds, thus helping China's securities market take the first 
gratifying step towards internationalization. Now, another 
group of 22 state-owned enterprises scattered over the country 
are going to be listed in Hong Kong and in the United States. 
What does it mean? It means that the transformation of China's 
state-owned enterprise mechanisms is successful and approved of 
and accepted by international investors, and that the trend of 
the reform of state-owned enterprises is good and promises high 
hopes of establishing a modern enterprise system. 
  In the exchange market of Hong Kong, we notice that the 
exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and renminbi is kept 
at 100 to around 110 and that between U.S. dollars and renminbi 
has remained at one to 8.7 since China announced the unification 
of the exchange rates. What does it mean? This phenomenon also 
shows that China's financial situation is stable. 
  We are not saying that everything is fine when we describe 
China's economic situation as good. Since China is so big a 
country and its conditions are so complicated, it is impossible 
that nothing is going wrong in the development process. Reform 
brings about a readjustment of interests, and different 
localities and different kinds of people benefit from the same 
reform at different times and in different degrees, thus it is 
inevitable that certain ideological problems arise. Reform is 
an orderly and gradual process which can never be accomplished 
in one move. At a time when the old system is being transformed 
into the new one and domestic and international markets have not 
converged, certain friction and conflicts are bound to arise. 
Although these problems are nonessentials, the CPC and the 
Chinese Government still attach great importance to them and 
vigorously seek to solve them by means of reform. 
  We appreciate the remark made by Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed: It is never easy to rule a country with a 
population of over 10 million, let alone rule a big country with 
a population of over 1.1 billion! If we take such an attitude, 
various nonessential problems arising in China's economic work 
are comprehensible.

<F P=106> [By Gao Sizhang: "Sale of Treasury Bonds to Foreigners in </F>
the Offing"] 
  [Text] China should open its treasury bonds to foreign 
investors to promote development of a market-oriented bond 
market, said a senior government official. 
  "We wish to open domestic treasury bonds to foreign 
investors 
as soon as possible," said Gao Jian, vice-director of the 
Ministry of Finance's Department of State Debt Administration. 
  Gao said that a timetable has not yet been set but that it 
seems sure no action will be taken this year. 
  He said the ministry has specified several issues for 
consideration while planning how to offer treasury bonds to 
foreigners. 
  Firstly, the bonds opened to foreign investors should be the 
same as those available to domestic investors. That means they 
must carry the same coupon rates for the same terms of maturity 
to ensure the market's integrity. 
  Secondly, the bonds should be denominated in renminbi so the 
government will not bear foreign exchange risks. 
  Thirdly, the bonds should have longer terms of maturity to 
diversify the structure of bonds. This is reinforced by the 
preference American institutional investors have for longer 
maturities, Gao said. 
  In fact, Gao said, his department was very close to coming 
up 
with a programme to open the government securities market to 
foreign investors in the first half of 1993, when authorities 
had great difficulty selling treasury bonds. 
  The government eventually sold out all the bonds so the 
programme was suspended, then finally scrapped. 
  The plan was to sell some of the five-year treasury bonds to 
foreign investors. The maturity and annual coupon rate were the 
same as those for primary dealers. 
  Foreign investors would have had to convert their foreign 
currencies into renminbi before buying the treasury bonds. 
  The proposal also specified the financial status of foreign 
securities firms, allowing them to subscribe treasury bonds on 
the primary market and trade them on the secondary market. 
  Gao said foreign participation would not only broaden the 
capital base for bonds but would also heighten competitiveness 
in the bond market. 
  Opening the market is an important measure to be taken next 
year to help build up a market-oriented bond-trading system. 
  "We anticipate a market-oriented government securities 
framework to be underway two years from now," he said. 
  If that is the case, Gao said, lots of things need to be 
done 
next year. 
  For example, he said, the primary dealer system must be more 
fully developed. 
  The Ministry of Finance is reviewing applications from banks 
and financial institutions that want to be primary dealers. 
  Meanwhile, the feeling is growing that the country should 
also develop short-term treasury bonds. 
  "We strongly suggest that six-month bonds should be 
renewed," 
Gao said. "Maturity should be diversified into three months and 
nine months."

  [Text] Shanghai, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The issuing of state 
bonds has become a pillar of China's securities market alongside 
the listed stocks, after six years of effort. 
  China has issued six types of such bonds since 1981. The 
amount expanded from 19.8 billion yuan-worth in 1981 to 100 
billion yuan-worth this year. 
  Until 1988 state bonds were not allowed to be put onto the 
market, a local bank official said. 
  "Although the interest rate on the bonds was higher than on 
the bank's savings deposits, people still regarded their 
purchase as making a contribution to the state and not making an 
investment for themselves," he explained. 
  A survey shows that the transactional volume of the Shanghai 
market for state bonds amounted to 11.321 billion yuan-worth in 
five trading days from May 30 to June 3, while that of stocks on 
the Shanghai Stock Exchange during this period reached only 2.54 
billion yuan-worth. 
  According to the official, state bond futures are more 
attractive to investors. 
  At present, China is working out a package of regulations to 
ensure the healthy development of these markets.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Shao Ling (6730 7227): "Reasons Why </F>
the Mainland Authorities Are Rectifying Futures Markets"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 8 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Futures 
markets in mainland China took off in the late 1980's, and, with 
their unique role, they rapidly became the third major 
investment craze after the stock and real estate crazes. 
However, as futures markets developed very rapidly, they were 
beset by many problems. Not long ago, the mainland's State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce and the China 
Securities Supervision and Regulatory Commission [CSSRC] issued 
a circular on rectification. 
  According to incomplete statistics, there are already 40 
exchanges on the mainland bearing the nameplates of "commodity 
exchange" and "futures exchange," of which 30 are officially 
registered, and there are nearly 300 futures brokerage 
companies, including more than 50 Sino-foreign joint-venture 
brokerage companies. If unregistered underground brokerage 
companies are added, the total number exceeds 500. There are 
over 50 items listed and traded as futures in existing 
exchanges, which fall into eight major categories, including 
agricultural products, petroleum, steel products, coal, 
nonferrous metals, ferrous metals, agricultural means of 
production, construction materials, industrial chemicals, and 
state treasury bonds. 
  The mainland's futures market have developed so rapidly with 
such an enormous number of transactions that even government 
officials are surprised. As of now, the United States, which 
has the most developed futures markets in the world, has 24 
exchanges, while Britain has just 11. It took several decades 
for the United States and Britain to develop their futures 
markets to what they are today. Nevertheless, mainland China has 
surpassed them in terms of numbers in a matter of years. 
Therefore, we can imagine how blindly its futures markets have 
developed. 
  In fact, as laws and regulations, as well as supervision and 
controls, failed to keep pace with the excessively rapid 
development of the futures markets, numerous problems have 
occurred. Hence, the authorities adopted some measures to 
rectify the futures markets in April and May of this year. Zhu 
Li, secretary general and concurrently spokesman of the CSSRC 
said recently: The State Council has issued a circular urging 
the firm checking of the blind development of futures markets, 
strengthening macromanagement of the markets, and exercising 
unified guidance, supervision, and control over the markets. 
Then, the Beijing authorities dispatched five joint 
investigation teams to North China, East China, South China, 
northeast China, and central China to conduct thorough 
investigations and make reports. According to the authority's 
analysis, the results of the recent investigations will have a 
great impact on the development of the mainland's futures 
markets. 
  It has been reported that the main problems are that 
exchanges are too numerous in number and are confused, the CSSRC 
is unable to exercise supervision and control, a "futures law" 
has not been enacted, and a lack of national standardization 
makes it difficult to put all exchanges on the right course. 
Moreover, exchanges in localities have simple and crude 
facilities and limited functions. As they are mismanaged, 
corrupt practices are prone to occur. It was precisely because 
supervision and administration departments were unable to 
exercise supervision and control that quite a few exchanges 
operated in their own ways and formulated their own "trading 
regulations." In particular, seizing this opportunity, 
Sino-foreign joint-venture or disguised joint-venture brokerage 
companies deceived their costumers using various means, thus 
causing an enormous foreign exchange drain. A certain futures 
company in Shenzhen is a case in point. After buying futures on 
behalf of its customers, the company, which claimed to be an 
agent of certain futures exchanges in Canada and Japan, did not 
produce any original transaction certificates while the clients' 
cash deposits given as collateral were sent abroad. When 
government organs investigated the case, personnel from the 
foreign side immediately pulled out of the company and returned 
to Hong Kong together with the relevant accounts. Almost all 
the clients lost money and the Chinese side of the joint-venture 
company also suffered a loss of 220,000 yuan. Those who really 
made fortunes were the foreign side of the company. 
  Moreover, capitalizing on imperfections in the regulations, 
the existence of a double-track exchange rate system, and the 
lack of a commodity price formation mechanism, some underground 
futures brokerage companies carried out illegal activities, such 
as money-for-power deals and contract breaches, thus making the 
futures market more confused. 
  Judging from this, the rectification of the futures market 
is 
indeed necessary. Therefore, the mainland's State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce promulgated the 
"Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Futures 
Brokerage Company Registration" in April. According to the 
regulations, for a futures brokerage company to operate, it must 
have capital of over 10 million yuan, suitable 
telecommunications facilities, and at least 20 full-time futures 
brokers; it must open a special account for customers' cash 
deposits used as collateral with designated financial 
institutions; and deposit at least 25 percent of its total 
registered capital as guaranty money. If it violates the 
regulations, it will be punished, ranging from a warning, 
confiscation of earnings, or the revocation of its license 
according to the seriousness of the case. Those violating the 
criminal law will be handed over to judicial organs for 
prosecution. 
  In early May, the CSSRC announced a decision to close some 
problem exchanges (it is said they amounted to 50 percent of the 
total number) as one of its emergency measures for further 
rectifying futures markets. At the same time, Beijing stepped 
up efforts to enact a "futures law" and other related laws in a 
bid to bring the futures market into an orbit of legal, normal, 
steady, and healthy development.

  [Text] China's recent move to rectify the futures market 
will create a favourable atmosphere for developing big, 
standardized exchanges, said a senior futures expert. 
  Chen Gongyan, vice-president of the Beijing Commodities 
Exchange, one of the country's major futures exchanges, said the 
adjustment will eliminate some regional and small futures 
exchanges that don't meet the government's standards. 
  Member companies of these exchanges will then seek to secure 
positions on big exchanges, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Chen said, since futures brokerages are 
prohibited 
from doing business on exchanges outside the mainland, more 
investment will flow into domestic trading centres. 
  In addition, the rectification is also spurring big 
exchanges 
to intensify efforts to standardize their management and 
operations, he said. 
  "The aim of the rectification is not to nip the young 
industry in the bud, but to ensure a healthy and stable 
development and a clear market for the industry," Chen said. 
  With futures companies and exchanges sprouting up across the 
country, China began rectifying futures companies last year and 
exchanges this year. 
  Before being allowed to resume business, companies and 
exchanges must pass government examinations on topics such as 
assets and transaction volume. 
  Chen said the Beijing Commodities Exchange is benefiting 
from 
heavy business resulting from the rectification. 
  Since the end of May, its daily transaction value has 
averaged 1.3 billion yuan ($149 million), compared with about 
300 million ($34.5 million) in March and 200 million ($23 
million) in April, Chen said. 
  "We are taking all possible measures to support the 
correction," he said. 
  However, since many exchanges are at a loss without detailed 
guidelines, Chen hopes the government will publicly clarify its 
policies. 
  "We should rely more on laws and regulations, instead of 
administrative policies, to supervise the market," he said. 
  Sources said China is speeding up the drafting of its first 
futures trading law, which would provide a legal framework for 
governing the new industry.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- A circular published by 
the State Council General Office today said that without the 
approval of the Chinese central bank, any region, department and 
individual should not produce, process, purchase gold or conduct 
wholesale and retail sales businesses of gold. 
  The circular said that recently illegal gold markets cropped 
up in some regions and some enterprises and individuals 
produced, purchased and sold gold without authorization. 
  It said that these led to the disorder of state supervision 
over gold and silver, and severely disturbed the smooth 
operation of state purchasing and selling of gold. 
  Because of that, the circular said, the amount of gold 
purchased by the state decreased by a big margin in recent 
months. 
  According to the gold and silver administration regulations, 
gold should all be purchased and sold by the People's Bank of 
China. 
  However, Cui Dewen, vice-director of the State Gold 
Administration under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, 
said that since last year, big-numbered illegal gold markets 
appeared around almost all China's major gold mines in Liaoning, 
Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Provinces. 
  The circular ordered that all the gold markets in operation 
or in preparation to set up must be closed down before the end 
of this month. 
  If illegal gold markets are found in some regions after July 
1, concerned staffs and major local officials will be punished 
according to law. 
  The circular also asked the Ministry of Metallurgical 
Industry and gold industry administrative departments at all 
levels to strengthen supervision over gold production and sales. 
  It reiterated that gold production enterprises must sell all 
the gold they produce to the People's Bank of China. 
  The circular said individuals will still be strictly banned 
to mine, process gold and resell gold ore. 
  The circular asked the public security, procuratorial, 
industry and commerce departments and also the customs to 
intensify investigation and handling of cases concerning illegal 
purchasing, reselling and smuggling of gold. 
  It said that any cases seizing a total of more than 50 grams 
of gold, will be dealt with as big cases. 
  The circular said that the duty-free shops conducting retail 
sales of gold or silver ornaments with approval should only sell 
the ornaments to the customers with foreign passports, 
home-returning permits for compatriots living in Hong Kong and 
Macao, and residence permits for overseas employees, with the 
payment of foreign exchange. 
  The circular also said that the gold and silver products 
produced in bonded zones should be exported. When they need to 
sell the products outside the bonded zones, the operation should 
be dealt with as imports. 
  The circular also prohibited gold futures trading, and the 
setting up of all kinds of gold futures trading centers. 
  Branches of the People's Bank of China were asked to 
strengthen gold-purchasing work. They were asked to readjust 
gold purchasing and selling prices according to the changes on 
international gold market.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a meeting in 
Beijing today, Cui Dewen, vice director of the State Gold 
Administration under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, 
called on localities to resolutely shut down illegal gold 
markets before the end of this month. 
  Cui Dewen pointed out the recent appearance of unauthorized 
gold transaction points in some regions and the brisk illegal 
transactions of gold there. The existence of illegal gold 
markets leads to the loss of gold products. Localities must 
conscientiously implement the guidelines set out in the relevant 
circular issued recently by the State Council General Office; 
immediately organize banks, industry and commerce departments, 
public security bureaus, customs, gold industry, and gold and 
jewelry production management departments to take forceful 
measures; further rectify illegal gold markets; and strictly 
investigate and handle cases of illegal sales of gold products 
by gold-producing enterprises. Concerned personnel and major 
local officials will be held responsible if illegal gold markets 
are found in their regions after 1 July. 
  Cui Dewen stressed that the state exercises fixed management 
over the production, processing, and wholesale and retail sales 
of gold and jewelry. Localities must immediately crack down on 
units that illegally sell gold and jewelry without the approval 
of the People's Bank of China. Gold futures trading is strictly 
prohibited, and the establishment of various types of gold 
futures markets is also strictly prohibited. All levels of gold 
management departments and production enterprises should enhance 
their management over finished gold products. Gold mines must 
turn over all the gold they produce to the state, they must not 
engage in illegal transactions, and they must not retain gold 
for their own use.

<F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai Petrochemical Co has shelved its plan to 
adopt a tender system for selling its second tranche of new A 
shares in China, says the lead underwriter. The head of 
Shanghai International Securities' corporate finance division, 
Ni Xinxian, said the sluggish market was contributing to the 
change of heart by China's biggest petrochemical firm. "The 
company and the underwriter have decided not to go ahead with 
the proposal given the present market conditions," he said in 
Shanghai. "The decision has nothing to do with the company's 
fundamentals," he said. The China Securities Regulatory 
Commission which was also involved in what would have been a 
pioneering move in the country, agreed to the decision too, Mr 
Ni said. 
  He said the shares earmarked for tender would not be issued 
until next year. Whether the scheme would revive would depend 
on market conditions, he said. But he did not say how the 
shares would be issued if they were not allocated through 
tendering. 
  Shanghai Petrochem's second tranche of 450 million shares 
was 
intended to be offered in two batches: 320 million shares were 
to be allocated to A shareholders at 2.4 yuan (about HK$2.14) a 
share and 130 million shares through tender. The tender system 
has come about to address weaknesses in existing offering 
systems for allocating A shares, such as an unlimited issue of 
subscription forms and a share allocation linking allocations 
with bank deposits. The former results in investors paying a 
high cost for share purchases and the latter results in 
subscription money long being frozen. 
  Mr Ni said the existing offering systems were a result of 
the 
underdeveloped banking system in China, which posed difficulties 
in settling payment of initial public offers. However, it is 
believed the falling stock market made it difficult to discover 
the price of shares offered through a tender system. Potential 
investors are reluctant to make offers for fears of further 
falls. The continuous slump in the price of Shanghai 
Petrochem's A shares also means that mainland investors can buy 
cheap stocks already available in the market, and it is 
unnecessary to use a tender to establish market interest. 
  The market price of Shanghai Petrochem had fallen below the 
subscription price for shareholders. Petrochem's A shares 
closed at 2.05 yuan on Friday, compared with 2.54 yuan in 
mid-April and 5.76 yuan on its debut close on the Shanghai stock 
exchange in November last year. 
  Concerns have also been raised over the feasibility of 
importing the international tender practice to China. However, 
Mr Ni said: "For a company such as Shanghai Petrochemical, which 
has launched an H-share offer in Hong Kong under the 
book-building system, we shouldn't have any worries." 
  The new initial public offering method comes at an 
unfavourable time. The A share indexes on the country's stock 
exchanges are sliding fast, offering no hope for the tender to 
operate in an effective manner. An excess of new listings have 
been a key factor in the market's slump this year, with large 
counters such as Shanghai Petrochem suffering the most. Mr Ni 
said the portion of 320 million new shares offered to 
shareholders in April had been fully subscribed. But no 
official announcement has been made on the level of 
subscription. Shanghai Petrochem announced on Friday that the 
share sale had been completed, and that 200 million shares would 
be listed on June 20. The 200 million shares represent those 
subscribed for by the public. The remaining 120 million shares, 
subscribed for by company employees, would be listed on July 4. 
  Shanghai Petrochem offered 550 million new A shares last 
year 
following a $2.65 billion H-share offer in Hong Kong in July, 
giving it a listing in the territory.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Foreign oil companies 
which were awarded blocks in the first round of international 
bidding for oil and gas exploration in the Tarim Basin in 
northwestern China have begun operations in the desert. 
  Zeng Xingqiu, vice-president of China National Oil and Gas 
Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), said exploration work 
was carried out in the first, second and fourth blocks, with 
AGIP, Esso and BP being the respective operators. 
  The three blocks, situated in the south-east of the 
Taklimakan Desert, totalled 38,765 square kilometers, Zeng said. 
The operators will work out exploration details and implement 
them in the light of the contracts, he added. 
  CNODC concluded two oil contracts and one agreement on a 
geo-physical survey with the three operating groups formed by 14 
foreign companies after they won the bidding. 
  A total of 68 companies from 17 countries had expressed 
interest in the five blocks China offered, although fewer tabled 
tenders afterwards. 
  Zeng said he was satisfied with the result of the bidding, 
China's first for onshore oil and gas exploration. He said the 
harsh natural conditions in the desert pose severe challenges to 
exploratory operations there. 
  The Tarim Basin, with an area of 560,000 square kilometers, 
is one of the few "virgin areas" in the world for oil and gas 
exploration. However, most of it is covered with dunes or even 
sand hills, and often referred to as a "sea of death." 
  "At a time when oil prices are stagnant, so many companies' 
participation in the bidding indicates their deep interest in 
China's oil and gas prospects," he added. 
  Zeng said China's second round of onshore international 
bidding has fared well. This time China exposed 26 blocks for 
risk exploration and 11 projects for enhancing oil recovery. 
  So far 76 companies from 17 countries in the world have 
registered and are studying data packages. Some of them have 
even made field tours, he said. 
  The deadline for lodging tenders is September 28 this year, 
he added.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Mainly by using foreign 
funds and imported power generating equipment, Huaneng 
International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) has fast 
grown into a leading independent power producer (IPP) in the 
world. 
  IPP refers to those specializing in power generation 
wherever 
it is necessary and without any prerequisites of building 
massive power transmission grids. 
  HIPDC, a joint venture founded in 1985, was the first of its 
kind aimed at raising funds, mostly foreign capital, to speed up 
China's power construction. There is a great shortage of 
electricity supplies compared with the swelling demand resulting 
from China's rapid economic development. 
  This venture now has 11 power plants across China, with 
operational generating capacity totaling 6,100 mw -- all 
accomplished in just nine years. 
  It also has sub-stations of 8,620 mva [expansion unknown] 
and 
3,470 km of high voltage transmission lines, in addition to the 
corporation's growing involvement in other trades and sectors. 
  According to a corporation source, a total of more than 2 
billion U.S. dollars in export credits, mixed government loans 
and commercial loans have been utilized over the past nine years. 
  Yu Minji, spokesman of HIPDC, said complete advanced power 
generating units were imported from Western countries and Japan 
to equip nine of the 11 plants now in operation. 
  He said that along with this procedure, advanced technology 
was brought in to fill the gap in China's power industry. 
  The Shanghai Shidongkou Second power plant, for example, was 
the country's first to install two 600 mw coal-fired 
super-critical units, in a bid to raise fuel efficiency and 
lower energy consumption. 
  The introduction of the fume-gas desulphurization equipment 
in Luohuang power plant and the combined cycle gas/steam turbine 
in Chongqing gas turbine power plant were also both "firsts" for 
China. 
  These plants also adopted a management system and model 
common in developed countries in order to upgrade themselves to 
international standards. Their streamlined structure allows 
them to operate with half the staff, or even less, usually 
required by other Chinese plants with similar capacity. 
  Yu said the corporation is expanding. Four power plants -- 
Yingkou, Shantou, Nanjing and Beijing Co-Generation -- are under 
construction. 
  He said that negotiations or preparations are being carried 
out for another four projects -- two extension projects and 
Dandong and Jinling power plants. 
  After their completion, the gross generating capacity of the 
corporation is expected to reach 10,500 mw, the spokesman added. 
  The corporation's practice epitomized China's drive to tap 
the international financial market for more power supplies. The 
country's whole power generating capacity stands at 180,000 mw 
and the figure needs to more than double by the end of this 
century if China's thirst for power is to be eased. 
  Yu said his corporation will build another 8,000 mw of 
generating capacity in seven years. More methods, such as joint 
investment and project financing, will be tried to make use of 
more foreign capital, he added. 
  Huaneng Power International, a company formed by HIPDC and 
its partners, is scheduled to begin offering its shares globally 
and is to be listed on the New York Stock Market later this year. 
  The company, composed of five power plants with their 
generating capacity amounting to 2,900 mw, is one of the five 
enterprises first approved by the State Council Securities 
Commission for New York listing.

  [Text] The Renminbi Exchange Rate Will Not Fluctuate 
by a Big Margin 
  In the three months since the unification operation, the 
renminbi exchange rate has normally fluctuated around the level 
of 8.7 yuan to one dollar and black market operations have been 
effectively contained. It is fully possible to accomplish 
normal fluctuation to control the renminbi exchange rate at a 
rational level in the future. First, China has strengthened 
macroeconomic regulation and control and the annual growth rate 
of the national economy in the 1990's will stay at 8 to 9 
percent, this year it will be 9 percent. The national economy is 
growing at an optimum rate and total import demand, that is, 
total scale of annual spending of foreign exchange, can be 
brought under effective control. Second, there are conditions 
for China's exports to develop at a rate slightly higher than 
that of the growth of the national economy. The export growth 
rate last year was lower than the growth rate of the national 
economy but the annual average export growth rate in the 15 
years since reform and opening-up is 16 percent, higher than the 
average growth rate of the national economy. The rapid growth 
of the national economy in the past few years has built a number 
of new production capacities, introduced a number of advanced 
technologies and equipment, and stepped up China's economic 
strength and export material basis. The reform measures 
introduced this year have created favorable conditions for the 
development of foreign trade exports. Both opportunities and 
challenges exist in the international trade environment but, 
taken as a whole, there are more opportunities than challenges. 
It is possible for China's exports to accomplish growth at a 
rate slightly higher than that of the growth of the national 
economy. Thus, the total amount of foreign exchange supply can 
be guaranteed. Third, China has introduced a number of measures 
to control inflation and the index of price increases this year 
should be controlled within 10 percent, with gradual reductions 
in ensuing years. The total average of export selling prices 
can still be increased somewhat. A balance between the two will 
not cause any great impact on the fluctuation of the renminbi 
exchange rate. Fourth, with the reform of the enterprise 
system, various types of enterprises are improving the 
operational mechanism of enjoying decisionmaking power over 
operations, assuming sole responsibility for their own profits 
and losses, self-development, and self-restraint. They are 
paying attention to the cost of using foreign exchange and 
reducing blindness in its use. Fifth, the state has introduced 
measures for stabilizing exchange quotations. Judged by last 
year's practices, under effective macroeconomic regulation and 
control, China is fully capable of introducing measures to 
stabilize exchange quotations. Sixth, we must maintain a 
favorable foreign trade management order and effectively guard 
against forcing up commodity prices, panic buying at home, and 
competing for sales by cutting prices in pursuit of exchange 
rates in the international market and thereby increasing export 
costs. We are making vigorous efforts to do a good job in this 
respect. Therefore, it is groundless to worry about large-scale 
fluctuations of the renminbi exchange rate. 
<H5>  Foreign Trade Restructuring Is Favorable to Foreign Exchange </H5>
Earnings and Income From Exports 
  To change the quotas of foreign exchange earnings and income 
from exports into guiding plans is favorable in itself for 
foreign trade enterprises to transform the operational 
mechanism, reinvigorate management, and increase foreign 
exchange earnings and income from exports. Moreover, a number 
of economic measures have been introduced to encourage 
enterprises to export more products and accrue more foreign 
exchange income. First, an exchange rate system favorable to 
exports has been introduced. The standard exchange rate level 
enables enterprises to gain rational profits under normal 
management conditions. Second, a standardized export tax 
reimbursement system, capable of accomplishing full and timely 
tax reimbursement and whose formalities are as simple and 
convenient as possible, is being implemented and it is still 
necessary to guard against illegal tax evasion. Third, set up 
an import and export bank is being set up to render funds 
support for the export of machinery and electronics products. 
Fourth, an export development fund and risk fund is being set 
up to support the stable development of some commodities whose 
prices fluctuate by a big margin on the international market, to 
develop new export commodities, and to provide risk guarantees 
for developing new markets and for exports to markets which have 
larger risks. Fifth, we must carry out credit policies 
favorable to foreign trade exports with the state rendering key 
supplies to export credit for various types of enterprises and 
the growth scale of loans should match the growth of exports. 
Sixth, according to the rights and duties which GATT developing 
country signatory parties should enjoy, China is in a position 
to enjoy fair competition treatment for exports of some primary 
products. Seventh, corresponding export promotion policies 
should be pursued and wages and bonuses in foreign trade 
enterprises should be linked with foreign exchange income from 
exports. Introduction of these policies and measures can 
basically overcome the contradiction whereby export sales are 
not as good as domestic sales, thus enabling China's commodities 
to compete on an equal basis with the same kinds of commodities 
made by other countries in the international market. 
  Exchange Rate Reform Will Not Affect Normal Exports 
  China is a developing country and to increase foreign 
exchange income from exports is mainly with the purpose of 
importing more advanced technology, equipment, and goods and 
materials required by the modernization program, as well as 
importing daily necessities for the people. This is what we 
must consider in working out reform policies. After the present 
exchange rate reform, there have been increases in exchange 
conversion, customs duty, and the circulating tax base and 
import costs have gone up correspondingly. However, these will 
not affect normal imports and the moderate growth of imports 
because, before the unification of the exchange rate, the import 
costs of 80 percent of the foreign exchange used for imports 
were calculated by exchange quotations on the swap market. 
Imports stayed high under the circumstances that foreign 
exchange swap prices were so high during the first half of last 
year but there is less chance that the exchange rate after 
unification will affect normal imports. The financial budget 
has been increased correspondingly for that portion of foreign 
exchange used for imports with foregin exchange at state-fixed 
prices if the imports are still arranged by the state. This 
will not affect normal imports. The tax base for customs duty 
and circulation tax has been raised but China will this year 
again take the initiative by reducing the customs duty rate for 
2,898 kinds of commodities. The margin of total customs duty 
reduction is 8.8 percent. China has made commitments to foreign 
countries that with the progress of substantive negotiations on 
the resumption of China's GATT signatory state status, China's 
total level of customs duty should be reduced by 50 percent on 
the basis of 1992. This can offset import cost increases as a 
result of increases in the tax base. Thus, it can be seen that 
normal imports will not be affected but we must guard against 
importing blindly and this has also been taken into 
consideration in the present exchange rate reform. 
<H5>  China Still Does Not Have the Conditions To Abolish the </H5>
Permit System in Foreign Trade Operations 
  The permit system in foreign trade operations is an 
important 
measure taken by some developing countries to strengthen foreign 
trade macroeconomic regulation and control and it is also a 
transitional measure. It will be abolished in the ordinary 
course of events after foreign trade legislation becomes sound 
and the market mechanism matures but China still does not have 
the conditions to abolish it. It has not been long since China 
carried out the policy of opening-up, understanding of the law 
of operations in international markets is inadequate, and there 
is an eager desire to speed up the development of foreign trade. 
Under such circumstances, if we slacken the necessary 
management, blindness will easily emerge. In the first half of 
1988, we transferred to the lower levels the power to examine 
and approve production enterprises to engage in foreign trade by 
themselves. Within three months, the number of units engaged in 
foreign trade increased by two-thirds and many of them basically 
did not have anyn of the conditions so to do. It resulted in 
serious chaos in the operational order and affected the normal 
development of foreign trade. Finally, we could not but carry 
out rectification and control. China has a population of nearly 
1.2 billion, the development level of the productive forces 
remains very low and the contradiction stands out sharply that 
total social supply cannot meet total demand. The things China 
exports are squeezed out and the training of China's foreign 
trade managerial staff cannot meet the needs. Under such 
circumstances, blindly setting up many enterprises engaged in 
foreign trade without taking conditions into account will 
inevitably lead to a situation whereby "the gruel is meager and 
the monks are many" and further to a situation wherein there are 
more monks than there is gruel available, affecting the normal 
development of foreign trade. Moreover, it is unfavorable to 
the realization of scale operation in foreign trade, to 
improving economic performance, and also unfavorable to 
upholding China's good reputation in the world. Permits to 
engage in foreign trade are just to examine the qualification 
and ability of operations without restricting quantity. We 
should emphasize both having the necessary conditions to acquire 
the power to engage in foreign trade and performing export 
duties to acquire such power. Some people say that the power to 
engage in foreign trade should be given but whether or not the 
enterprises export is for themselves to decide. Such a statement 
is incorrect. The purpose of granting enterprises with the 
conditions the power to engage in foreign trade is to enable 
them to make use of the markets and resources, both at home and 
overseas, to reinvigorate their operations and also to promote 
heightening the technological and management level after 
participating in competition in the international market. If 
enterprises have the power to engage in foreign trade and yet do 
not export, it is not only difficult to ensure the state's 
foreign exchange income but this is also unfavorable to the 
progress of enterprises. What then is the use of having the 
power to engage in foreign trade?! It is not an easy job to 
develop the international market. We must build up 
relationships of mutual trust with our clients with a continuous 
and stable supply of goods, otherwise it will be very difficult 
to occupy the market. If we retreat easily from the market and 
lose our credit, then we have to pay several times the original 
price to redevelop the market again. Considered from the 
interests of the state and the interests of enterprises, we must 
never be careless about this issue. 
  Effectively Stop Forcing Prices Up, Panic Buying, 
and Competing for Sales By Cutting Prices 
  Due to the introduction of new pricing reform measures, the 
production costs of related products have increased and it is 
understandable to raise the prices of goods supplied for export 
appropriately but it is absolutely not allowed to exploit the 
advantage of reform and raise prices unscrupulously at will. 
Such prices of supplying goods are unacceptable and should be 
reported to commodity price management departments. Goods can 
only be purchased at prices of domestic market supply according 
to the principle of fluctuation in line with market conditions. 
We should resolutely stand up against prices being forced down 
by foreign businessmen. The exchange prices of commodities in 
the international market are determined by the social average 
labor of mankind and fluctuate rationally according to supply 
and demand relations. It is an unreasonable demand for foreign 
businessmen to force prices down and share the benefits of 
China's unification of exchange rates. The dollar has lost half 
its value against the Japanese yen over nearly 10 years. Can we 
succeed in demanding that U.S. businessmen lower their export 
prices?! Foreign trade enterprises must not be too weak and far 
less should they use this as a pretext to compete for sales by 
cutting prices. 
  It is a key to success in foreign trade reform to 
effectively 
stop forcing up prices, panic buying, and competing for sales by 
cutting prices and to maintain good order in foreign trade 
operations. Forcing up prices, panic buying, and competing for 
sales by cutting prices affect the normal fluctuations of the 
exchange rate and weaken the benefits from the unification of 
the exchange rates. They affect domestic price raises and 
influence popular feelings, stability, and social stability. 
They cause benefits to flow out and lower the performance of 
foreign trade operations. They also harm the reputation of 
China's commodities and cause the confidence of foreign 
businessmen to waver in handling Chinese products. They lead to 
antidumping measures by foreign countries and cause the 
deterioration of the foreign trade operations environment. They 
cause blind development of production and affect the rational 
readjustment of the industrial structure. We must arouse the 
serious attention of the foreign trade management departments, 
enterprises, and the parties concerned. We should unite as one, 
take practical measures, maintain good order in foreign trade 
operations, ensure the successful progress of foreign trade 
reform, and promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
of China's foreign trade.
