  [Text] Shanghai, June 11 (XINHUA) -- China is making big 
efforts to boost its telecommunications sector to constantly 
improve services, according to Zhu Gaofeng, vice-minister of 
posts and telecommunications. 
  The state has worked out a package of policies in favor of 
telecommunications development over the past decade while 
applying the world's newest technology in this field, said the 
vice-minister at a recent international telecommunications 
technology conference in Shanghai. 
  China's annual telecommunications traffic volume rose by 
24.4 
percent in the 1986-90 period, another 40.4 percent in 1991, 
still another 49.5 percent in 1992 and a record 68.5 percent 
last year. 
  By the end of last year, the nation's telephone exchange 
capacity totalled 29.84 million lines, and 99 percent of the 
urban telephones are automatic. 
  The country plans to form a digital transmission network in 
the major cities by 1995. 
  By the end of this century, the vice-minister noted, China 
will establish a nationwide automatic telephone network with a 
popularization rate of 7.8 telephones for every 100 people.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692)] </F>
  [Text] In order to resolve the increasingly serious problem 
that railway transportation capacity has not kept pace with 
speedy economic development, over one million railway workers 
are presently working on large railway projects in the north, 
east, center, south, and northwest of China. This year, China 
will mainly work on 10 major railway projects and is now 
planning three other railway projects. 
  In an interview with this staff reporter yesterday, Wang 
Chengzhi, an official of the Planning Department of China's 
Ministry of Railways, said that this year, the central 
authorities have allocated over 40 billion yuan to the Ministry 
of Railways for new investment plans, some 10 billion yuan more 
than last year. Moreover, the funds are for key state guaranteed 
projects. 
  The central authorities have given "military decrees" to 
Baotou, Anshan, and Panzhi, the three large iron and steel 
corporations charging them with the task of producing millions 
of tons of tracks and supplying them for use in the 
Beijing-Kowloon railway, which stretches some 2,538 kilometers. 
Moreover, additional track will be procured from abroad. 
  China's 10 major railway projects are: The Beijing-Kowloon 
railway (which connects to Kowloon), the Baoji-Zhongwei 
(Shaanxi's Baoji-Ningxia's Zhongwei) railway, the Lan-Xin 
(Gansu's Wuwei-Xinjiang's Urumqi) railway, the electric railway 
project for the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the Nanning-Kunming 
railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi double-track (Hangzhou-Zhuzhou 
section) railway, the Beijing-Guangzhou railway expansion 
project, the Hou-Yue (Shanxi's Houma-Henan's Yueshan) railway, 
the Xian-Ankang railway, and the Datong-Qinhuangdao railway. 
  Wang said: In addition to that, the Ministry of Railways is 
planning to build a 710-km railway from Nanjing to Wuhan along 
the Chang Jiang. There are already railways in both Nanjing and 
Wuhan, but between them is only the 237-km railway along the 
banks of the Chang Jiang from Anhui's Tongling to Jiangxi's 
Jiujiang. Therefore, the state has recently approved building 
of a new railway along the Chang Jiang. 
  He said: The project on the Nanjing-Wuhan railway, which 
runs along the Chang Jiang, is expected to be started next year 
and put into operation by 1998. At that time, the railway will 
link the Beijing-Shanghai, the Anhui-Jiangxi, the 
Beijing-Kowloon, and the Beijing-Guangzhou railways, and will 
shorten the current railway transportation mileage between Wuhan 
and Shanghai by over 200 km and alleviate the increasingly heavy 
sea transportation along the Chang Jiang. 
  Wang said: The Ministry of Railways also plans to build two 
special passenger railways running between Beijing and Shanghai 
and between Shenyang and Qinhuangdao. The Beijing-Shanghai 
route will stretch for 1,460 kilometers and entail an investment 
of 70 billion yuan, and the Shenyang-Qinhuangdao route will 
stretch for 430 kilometers and entail an investment of over 10 
billion yuan. There are plans to use foreign capital for the 
two routes.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "China, Too, Paves Data Superhighway"] </F>
  [Text] China is speeding up the construction of its own 
information superhighway -- the Three Golden projects. 
  Ji Tong Communications Co Ltd, a shareholding company set up 
last September, is in charge of the Golden Bridge and Golden 
Customs projects. 
  Golden Bridge will be a national public economic-information 
network linking 500 cities and more than 10,000 information 
resources including large enterprises, institutes and government 
departments. 
  Ji Tong will soon start construction of the network's main 
centre and branch centres in 20 large cities, said Lu Shouqun, 
president of Ji Tong. 
  Golden Customs, whose goal is paperless foreign trade, will 
be in operation before the end of the year, he revealed. 
  Ji Tong is co-operating with Great Wall Computer Group Co 
and 
IBM Corp of the U.S. to conduct pilot works for the Golden Card 
project in 10 coastal cities, which aims to replace cash with 
electronic money -- credit cards. 
  Lu said Ji Tong will also co-operate with the Ministry of 
Radio, Film and Television to build and operate multimedia cable 
TV networks. 
  The cost of building this information infrastructure will be 
enormous. Lu said Ji Tong will raise capital through various 
channels, including foreign funds. 
  Ji Tong is also actively seeking cooperation with foreign 
firms, he said. 
  It has established a $30 million joint venture with Bell 
South Corp, an American regional telephone company, to engage in 
telecommunications and cable TV network projects. 
  Ji Tong signed an agreement with IBM to set up a multimedia 
information network research and development company to provide 
technical support for the Three Golden projects. 
  The investment for the joint venture's first stage is $10 
million. Both sides will inject more money in the future. 
  Ji Tong has two more joint ventures, with companies from 
Malaysia and Hong Kong. 
  Each day Ji Tong deals with five to eight multinational 
corporations eager to participate in building China's ambitious 
information networks. 
  Lu said the government hopes the Three Golden projects will 
stimulate the development of domestic information and 
electronics industries. 
  China will import some equipment but most will be supplied 
by 
domestic manufacturers and joint ventures. 
  Foreign companies with high technologies are welcome to 
co-operate with domestic producers. 
  Ji Tong will choose some large and medium-sized State 
enterprises to set up its production bases, Lu said. 
  Lu will soon go to the United States, Germany and France to 
inspect their progress in developing information superhighways.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Telecoms Work Will Be Hastened"] </F>
  [Text] China will pick up the pace in its march toward 
modernizing its backward telecommunications by the year 2000, 
said a top government official. 
  Ye Qing, Vice-Minister of the State Planning Committee, said 
telecommunications have been a bottleneck in the national 
economy despite momentous growth in the last few years. 
  Major difficulties have been the lack of capital, technology 
and proper management, Ye said over the weekend at the 
International Conference on China's Telecommunications. 
  The conference, held in Beijing, was called to provide China 
with international expertise and perspectives in its determined 
effort to improve telecommunications. It was organized by the 
State Planning Committee and sponsored by Morgan Stanley and Co, 
Arthur Andersen and Co, Captel International and Baker and 
McKenzie. 
  Ye said China is receptive to international suggestions in 
drafting its telecommunications development strategy for the 
1990s. 
  It is predicted that by 2000 domestic demand for telephones 
will soar to 30 million to 50 million. 
  The demand for fax machines will be 2 million to 3 million; 
for mobile phones 4 million to 6 million; and for 
programme-controlled exchanges, 18 million to 23 million lines. 
  Wu Xiaolong, director-general of the Ministry of Electronics 
Industry's overall development department, said that in the 
remainder of this century priority will be given to developing 
programme-controlled exchanges, fibre-optic networks, and 
mobile, satellite and microwave telecommunications systems. 
  He predicted that telecommunications industrial output will 
surpass 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) by 2000, over 15 
percent of the country's entire electronics production. 
  By then, Wu said, the technical level of major 
telecommunications products in China will match the 
international norms of the mid-1990s. 
  The Ministry of Electronics Industry has taken on the 
country's most ambitious development plan: to build an 
information superhighway, 
  The plan has three major parts. 
  First comes the Golden Bridge, a telecommunications network 
linking departments of the State Council with 30 provinces and 
autonomous regions, 500 cities, 12,000 large- and medium-sized 
enterprises, 100 leading business groups and the country's key 
projects. 
  Second comes the Golden Customs which will link authorities 
managing foreign trade, foreign exchange control and customs 
with foreign trade enterprises. This will speed up the handling 
of customs statistics, tax rebates, cash settlement and 
verification of licenses and certifications of country of origin. 
  The third is the Golden Card project in 10 coastal cities 
with the aim to replace cash with checks and credit cards. 
  Wu reiterated that China welcomes foreigners to invest in 
the 
domestic manufacture of telecommunications equipment, 
  Meocre Li, a senior manager with Arthur Andersen, said his 
auditing and consulting firm is working on the first direct 
listing on the New York Stock Exchange of a Chinese-incorporated 
power-generation company.

<F P=106> [By Song Ning: "State Awards Italtel $10.5m Telecom Deal"] </F>
  [Text] A leading Italian telecommunication equipment 
manufacturer was awarded a $10.5 million contract over the 
weekend to supply telephone switching facilities to four Chinese 
railway agencies. 
  Italtel will supply 100,000 lines of programme-controlled 
telephone switching equipment to Shenyang, Harbin, Hohhot and 
Lanzhou railway bureaus. It is the first equipment supply 
contract Italtel has won on the Chinese market. 
  The four cities are major railway hubs in China. Chinese 
officials said the operation of the equipment, scheduled to 
begin next year, will improve management and transport capacity 
in Northeast and Northwest China. 
  The project was funded by a World Bank loan. Italtel 
defeated other contenders because of its reasonable price, 
Chinese officials said. 
  "We're proud of this contract," said Alberto Cnirieleison 
[as 
published], chief representative of Italtel in Beijing, "because 
it signifies a new starting point for the co-operation between 
Italtel and China." 
  The company's equipment is used in 18 countries, mostly in 
Europe. But officials predicted it could get a sizable share of 
the Chinese market relatively soon because the market here is 
huge. 
  The untapped potential of China's telecommunications sector 
was the focus of a conference held last week in Beijing as 
foreign manufacturers fiercely compete to pry open the market. 
Many of them have already started manufacturing in China, like 
Canadian North Telecom and Siemens of Germany. 
  China is expected to spend $6 billion on telecommunications 
equipment this year and up to $90 billion by the year 2000. 
  Italtel does have a short history of aiding the Chinese. It 
agreed to transfer the technology of producing digital 
transmission equipment to the Number 515 Factory in Chongqing, 
Sichuan Province, in 1985. The products have now been sold 
abroad.

<F P=106> ["Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation </F>
(MOFTEC) Circular on Printing, Distributing `Regulations on 
Application for and Administration of Export Licenses'"] 
  [Text] To foreign economic and trade departments and 
commissions, foreign trade bureaus, MOFTEC special 
representatives offices in various localities in all provinces, 
autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities separately listed 
in state plans, the Quota and License Affairs Administration, 
chambers of commerce for importers and exporters, corporations, 
industrial and trade companies, the Guangdong Branch 
Administration of Customs, and Customs at the bureau and 
department levels: 
  In order to give the work of foreign trade 
administration a more standardized form in law, the General 
Administration of Customs and this ministry have formulated 
"Regulations on Application for and Administration of Export 
Licenses," and now have printed them and distribute them to you. 
The Regulations are in effect from 1 April 1994. 
  Annex: Regulations on Application for and 
Administration of Export Licenses MOFTEC of the PRC 23 February 
1994 
<H5>  Annex: Regulations on Application for and Administration of </H5>
Export Licenses 
  In order to further deepen the restructuring of foreign 
trade 
and strengthen and perfect the work of export license 
administration so that the foreign trade export business will 
develop in an orderly and healthy way, the regulations on 
application for and administration of export licenses are now 
laid down as follows: 
  Article I. Organs responsible for the administration and 
issue of export licenses 
  1) MOFTEC is the administrative organ for export licenses 
and 
is responsible for formulating, revising, and interpreting 
relevant administrative regulations. 
  2) MOFTEC is responsible for promulgating and interpreting 
the scope and list of commodities under the administration of 
export licenses and for making adjustments according to the 
situation of the international market and the domestic supply of 
goods. 
  3) MOFTEC's Quota License Affairs Administration, offices of 
MOFTEC special representatives in various localities, foreign 
economic and trade commissions (departments), and foreign trade 
bureaus empowered by MOFTEC in all provinces, autonomous 
regions, municipalities, and cities separately listed in state 
plans are license-issuing organs under the state export 
authorization system. 
  Article II. Principles of issuing export licenses 
  1) When exporting commodities administered by export 
licenses, export units should apply for export licenses in 
advance. 
  2) The principle of graded administration is implemented 
when 
issuing export licenses, and license-issuing organs at all 
levels must issue export licenses in strict accordance with the 
scope authorized by MOFTEC and never overstep it. 
  3) When exporting commodities which must have licenses 
issued 
by license-issuing organs in places of production attached, all 
export enterprises must apply for export licenses from 
license-issuing organs at designated places of production; 
whereas departments in charge of economic and trade work in 
places of production should take the responsibility for 
investigating commodity market quotations, price information, 
and market demand, and promptly report it to MOFTEC. 
  4) Foreign trade (industrial and trade) companies under 
various central departments implementing a single-track system 
of planned administration and foreign trade (industrial and 
trade) corporations under various central departments 
implementing a double-track system of planned administration run 
some of the exports by themselves and apply for export licenses, 
on the basis of their quotas, from MOFTEC's Quota and License 
Affairs Administration. For commodities which must be attached 
with licenses issued by designated license-issuing organs and 
places of production, licenses must be collected at designated 
license-issuing organs and places of production. 
  5) All kinds of export quotas are valid for a year, and 
export units must apply for export licenses by 15 December. 
  6) In order not to affect the export business in the 
following year, before MOFTEC assigns commodity quotas to lower 
levels, all export enterprises with annual export quotas in the 
previous year (not including supplementary parts) can collect in 
advance, from 15 December, export licenses for the following 
year according to one-fourth of their export quotas in the 
previous year. Regarding the issue date of export licenses, 1 
January of the following year should be filled in, and the 
export licenses will become effective from 1 January of the 
following year and will be considered as part of export quotas 
in the following year and counted in the following year's 
statistics of licenses issued. For commodities which export 
licenses cannot be collected in advance, MOFTEC will inform 
various license-issuing organs beforehand. 
  Article III. Validity period of export licenses 
  1) The system of "a license for a batch" is, in general, 
implemented for commodities under the administration of export 
licenses. Starting from the day of issue, every export license 
cannot last for more than three months and can only be used once 
for customs declaration during its validity period. Once a 
license is signed and sealed by Customs, the original 
license-collecting unit must return it to the license-issuing 
unit for verification and cancellation. 
  2) The system of "a license for a batch" is not 
implemented for the following commodities: 
  1. Commodities exported by foreign-funded enterprises and as 
items of compensation trade; 
  2. A total of 26 products--rice, soybeans, corn, bean 
dregs/bean cake, live pigs, live oxen, live sheep, fowl, frozen 
beef, frozen mutton, frozen pork, frozen poultry, frozen 
suckling pigs, frozen young pigeons, hairy crabs, swimming 
crabs, chestnuts, pears, Hami melons, tea, fireworks and 
firecrackers, toilet paper, hand-made embroidery, crude oil, 
finished oil, and coal; 
  3. For export commodities not under the system of "a license 
for a batch," the maximum validity period of export licenses is 
six months and licenses are allowed to be used for customs 
declaration for as many as 12 times. The licenses are not 
renewable and the volume of export commodities is marked down by 
Customs batch by batch. Once a license is used, the 
license-collecting unit must return it to the license-issuing 
unit for verification and cancellation. 
  3) Once an export license is signed and issued, no 
license-issuing organ and export unit can alter the license 
content. In general, export licenses cannot be carried over to 
and used in the following year, and they are valid until 31 
December of that year at the latest. When an export license has 
to be carried over to and used in the following year, it must be 
renewed at the original license-issuing organ. It is valid 
until the end of next February at the latest and cannot be 
extended. 
  Article IV. The export license administration of special 
commodities 
  1) Commodities banned from export are: musk, natural bezoar, 
copper and copper radical alloys, platinum, arsenic trichloride, 
dioxane (methane, ethane-n-propane, or isopropane) amino 
ethyl-2-alcohol and related chemical compounds made of 
quaternary ammonium, such as: N.N-diethyl ethanolamine, 
N.N-dimethyl ethanolamine, N.N-isopropyl ethanolamine, dithiol 
(dihydroxyethyl and thiodiglycol), and commodities banned from 
export according to regulations of relevant international 
conventions. 
  No enterprise is allowed to run export business of 
commodities banned from export. 
  2) Chemicals for military and civilian use (see the attached 
list) 
  No matter what kind of trading form is taken, all chemical 
exports for military and civilian use must be reported to and 
authorized by MOFTEC, and export licenses must be applied for 
according to regulations. In seeking MOFTEC authorization, 
export enterprises must produce letters of guarantee issued by 
relevant government departments of commodity-importing 
countries, pledging not to apply any commodities purchased to 
producing chemical weapons and not to transfer the commodities 
to the third countries. 
  3) Chemicals easily made into poison (see the attached list) 
  No matter what kind of trading form is taken, all chemical 
exports for military and civilian use must be reported to and 
authorized by MOFTEC, and export licenses must be applied for 
according to regulations. When exporting ephedrine, 
pseudo-ephedrine, yellow camphor, and piperonal, export 
enterprises should ask importers to produce certificates of 
legal application issued by relevant government departments of 
commodity-importing countries (regions). 
  4) Deuterium oxide 
  No matter what kind of trading form is taken, exports of 
deuterium oxide must be reported to and authorized by MOFTEC, 
and export licenses must be applied for according to regulations. 
  5) Administration of exported live pond fish, fresh 
vegetables, and fruit 
  As far as the administration of live pond fish, fresh 
vegetables, and fruit exported to Hong Kong and Macao is 
concerned, clearances are still issued according to existing 
regulations. 
  Article V. Content to be examined and verified when issuing 
export licenses 
  1) When applying for an export license, an export unit has 
to 
submit to the license-issuing organ relevant documents of 
approval and information and the export contract (all copies of 
the original). If necessary, a letter of credit must be 
produced and an application form for an export license must be 
filled in. The license-issuing organ must strictly rely on 
these formalities to issue the export license. 
  2) Strictly examining and verifying whether or not the 
export 
unit has a concrete record of export, is capable of running 
export business, or has the right to export that commodity. 
  3) Examining and verifying export prices. License-issuing 
organs at all levels must examine contracts and issue export 
licenses in strict accordance with pricing packages drawn up by 
various import and export chambers of commerce. 
  Article VI. Administration of exports in barter and border 
trade 
  1) For commodities exported to the former Soviet Union, 
Eastern Europe, the DPRK, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Laos on a 
barter basis--grain (soybeans, rice, corn, and wheat), tungsten 
sand, and crude oil and finished oil, arrangements are made to 
export them on a barter basis. The export of such commodities 
as chemicals for military and civilian use, chemicals easily 
made into poison, and deuterium oxide must be reported to MOFTEC 
for examination and verification, then enterprises take MOFTEC's 
documents of approval to the ministry's Quota and License 
Affairs Administration to apply for export licenses; whereas 
such formalities are no longer apply to other export commodities. 
  2) For exports to other countries and regions through barter 
and border trade, export licenses are applied for according to 
the regulations of graded administration of export licenses. 
  3) Trading with Taiwan is not within the realm of border 
trade and is carried out according to the regulations of Taiwan 
trade. For commodities under the export license administration, 
export licenses are applied for according to the regulations of 
the graded administration of export licenses. 
  Article VII. Administration of foreign-funded 
enterprises' exports 
  1) For commodities which are produced and exported by 
foreign-funded enterprises and which are administered by export 
licenses (including processing imported materials for export), 
export licenses are applied for according to the regulations of 
graded administration of export licenses. License-issuing 
organs at all levels must issue export licenses in strict 
accordance with annual quantities of export commodities issued 
by MOFTEC to foreign-funded enterprises. For commodities the 
prices of which are required to be examined, these prices are 
strictly examined before licenses are issued. 
  2) Foreign-funded enterprises must export self-made products 
in line with the scope of business and the scale of production 
and export authorized by the prescribed procedure, and must 
never export products purchased or run their business beyond the 
approved scale without authorization. 
  3) For newly established and existing foreign-funded 
enterprises which want to widen the scope of business or expand 
production scale, if their exported products are under the 
export license administration and the state quota 
administration, they should be reported to and authorized by 
MOFTEC at the stage of setting up the production projects before 
the products can be examined and approved according to the 
prescribed procedure. License-issuing organs at all levels will 
not issue export licenses to the above-mentioned projects 
approved by enterprises themselves without MOFTEC's 
authorization. 
  4) For projects undertaken by foreign-funded enterprises and 
projects of compensation trade approved before the revision of 
the catalog of commodities under the export license 
administration, products which become newly-added commodities 
under the export license administration owing to the catalog 
revision can be listed in the catalog of foreign-funded 
enterprise export commodities during the effective contracting 
period according to the scope of business and the scale of 
production and export authorized by law. 
  Article VIII. Administration of processing supplied 
materials and assembling supplied parts for export 
  Enterprises processing supplied materials and assembling 
supplied parts for export are exempted from applying for export 
licenses. Such exports are supervised, checked, and released by 
Customs according to relevant regulations. 
  Article IX. Administration of processing imported materials 
for export 
  1) Processing imported materials for export is within the 
normal scope of trade. Any authorized enterprises having the 
right to running import and export trade can engage in this type 
of business. 
  2) The business of processing imported materials for export 
is handled according to the regulations of the Customs' 
"Circular on Issuing the 'PRC Customs' Administrative Method of 
Import and Export Goods Processed From Imported Materials'" 
(No.403 of the Customs' Goods No.88) and is no longer reported 
to MOFTEC for examination and verification. 
  3) For export commodities processed from imported materials 
(with the exception of rolled steel, pig iron, and zinc) which 
are under the export license administration and the state quota 
administration, export licenses must be applied for before 
registering with Customs for entering in the records according 
to quotas issued to them by the State. 
  As far as the processing of imported materials of rolled 
steel, pig iron, and zinc is concerned, units running the 
business of processing key imported raw and processed materials 
for export should apply for export licenses from license-issuing 
units by producing the "Registration Manual of Processing 
Imported Materials" and export contracts, which will not be 
counted in the annual quota targets. 
  4) As far as the processing of imported materials of 
ordinary 
commodities administered by export licenses is concerned, units 
running this type of business should apply for export licenses 
from license-issuing units by producing the "Registration Manual 
of Processing Imported Materials" and export contracts. 
  5) In doing the business of processing imported materials, 
foreign-funded enterprises should strictly control it within the 
originally authorized scope and scale of business. 
  Article X. Administration of export of goods and materials 
needed for establishing enterprises overseas 
  As far as joint-venture, cooperative, and PRC-invested 
enterprises established overseas by the country are concerned, 
if shares are bought in the form of various raw and processed 
materials and spare parts, or the supply of domestic raw and 
processed materials and spare parts is needed after the 
enterprises have been established and put into production, 
export licenses should be applied for according to regulations 
since these practices are considered normal trade and export. 
  Article XI. Administration of projects contracted, complete 
sets of equipment exported, and goods and materials shipped out 
by companies engaging in external economic and technological 
cooperation 
  1) Companies authorized to contract external projects and 
engage in labor cooperation with the outside can ship out 
Chinese-made equipment, materials, and construction machines and 
tools to be used in the projects as well as public articles used 
daily by working personnel. For commodities not within the 
scope of license administration, customs declarations of export 
goods should be filled in and the export formalities prescribed 
by Customs should be gone through by producing project contracts 
and indicating the quantities provided for in foreign enterprise 
instruments of ratification, and there is no need to apply for 
export licenses. But if equipment and construction machines and 
tools are shipped back to the country again, customs 
declarations of import goods should be filled in and the import 
formalities prescribed by Customs should be gone through by 
simultaneously producing the original customs declarations of 
export goods. For commodities under export license 
administration, export licenses must be applied for according to 
regulations. 
  If commodities administered by export licenses are shipped 
out for company use, project contracts should be produced to 
apply for export licenses from license-issuing organs at 
respective levels. Foreign trade (industrial and trade) 
companies under various central departments should apply for 
export licenses from MOFTEC's Quota and License Affairs 
Administration; whereas companies and production enterprises at 
various local levels should apply for export licenses from 
provincial license-issuing organs in which they are located, 
irrespective of which level of license-issuing organs should 
issue licenses to the commodities. 
  2) Projects and daily articles shipped out by contracting 
project companies must be really needed for external projects 
and labor cooperation, cannot be over-reported, and cannot be 
misappropriated or resold. 
  3) For commodities under the administration of export 
licenses which must be shipped out when exporting complete sets 
of equipment, contracts of exporting whole sets of equipment 
should be produced and applications handled by license-issuing 
organs at respective levels in light of the method of applying 
for export licenses for contracting projects. 
  Article XII. Administration of tourist commodities brought 
out of the country by foreign tourists, compatriots from Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese, who purchase the 
commodities with foreign exchange they have taken into the 
country 
  1) Tourists entering the country (including foreign 
attendants of means of transport) can use foreign exchange they 
have taken into the country to purchase unrestricted numbers, 
value, and varieties of tourist souvenirs and arts and crafts. 
Customs will clear tourist commodities after examining invoices 
issued by departments selling the commodities as well as foreign 
exchange receipts. Traditional Chinese crude drugs and Chinese 
medicine, whether or not they are purchased by foreign exchange, 
are handled with restrictions in value according to customs 
regulations. 
  2) With the exception of commodities administered by export 
licenses (including commodities administered by quotas), 
domestic departments selling other tourist commodities can, 
after seeking MOFTEC's approval, accept export orders of small 
batches under $50,000 (or at $50,000). Customs will clear the 
tourist commodities after examining customs declarations of 
export goods filled in by domestic departments selling the 
commodities and relevant certificates (contracts). 
  Article XIII. Administration of exhibits, exhibits for sale, 
and small items for sale shipped out of the country and shown 
and sold at overseas exhibitions 
  1) Administration of exhibits shipped out of the country 
  For various exhibits shown (and not for sale) at overseas 
exhibitions sponsored by the country, there is no need to apply 
for export licenses. When shipping out the exhibits, Customs 
will clear them after checking certificates and customs 
declarations of export goods produced by units sponsoring the 
exhibitions. All exhibits must be shipped back to the country 
after the exhibitions. 
  2) Administration of exhibits for sale and small items for 
sale shipped out of the country. 
  1. As far as exhibits for sale and small items for sale 
taken to overseas exhibitions sponsored by foreign trade 
(industrial and trade) companies are concerned, there is no need 
to apply for export licenses for commodities not administered by 
export licenses, and Customs will clear them after examining 
customs declarations of export goods filled in by export units 
and detailed lists attached. For commodities administered by 
export licenses, these must be applied for at appropriate 
levels, whereas commodities administered by quotas are not 
counted as part of quota targets. 
  2. As far as exhibits for sale and small items for sale 
taken to overseas exhibitions sponsored by units not engaging in 
foreign trade are concerned, whether or not the commodities are 
administered by export licenses, these must be applied for at 
appropriate levels. 
  Article XIV. Administration of samples shipped out of the 
country 
  1) Regarding experimental samples provided to the outside 
world by units not engaging in foreign trade or technological 
exchange and other activities, if the quantities are reasonable 
and each batch of samples is worth 2,000 yuan or less, whether 
or not the commodities are administered by export licenses, the 
units are exempted from applying for export licenses, and 
Customs will clear the samples after examining certificates 
produced by and customs declarations of export goods filled in 
by departments (at and above the department and bureau levels) 
supervising units shipping out the samples; to ship out samples 
valued at more than 2,000 yuan, units must apply for export 
licenses. In order to make things convenient for enterprises, 
export licenses are issued by provincial license-issuing organs 
in places where units shipping out samples are located after 
examining certificates produced by departments (at and above the 
department and bureau levels) supervising the units (units at 
the central level still have to apply for export licenses from 
MOFTEC's Quota and License Affairs Administration), and the word 
"samples" must be clearly stated on export licenses. 
  2) If foreign trade enterprises and production enterprises 
entitled by MOFTEC and its authorized departments to run import 
and export business need to ship out samples, their cases must 
be handled according to the following regulations: 
  1. If Customs consider, after examination and verification, 
quantities of sample commodities not administered by export 
licenses reasonable, no matter how much the goods are worth, 
units are exempted from applying for export licenses, and 
Customs will clear the samples after examining customs 
declarations of export goods filled in by the units shipping out 
the samples. 
  2. If Customs consider, after examination and verification, 
quantities of sample commodities administered by export licenses 
as reasonable and each batch of the samples is worth less than 
2,000 yuan, units are exempted from applying for export 
licenses, and Customs will clear the samples after examining 
customs declarations of export goods filled in by the units. 
For samples valued at a range from over 2,000 yuan to 10,000 
yuan, export licenses must be applied for. In order to make 
things convenient for enterprises, export licenses are issued by 
provincial license-issuing organs in places where 
license-collecting units are located (foreign trade and 
industrial and trade companies of various central departments 
under the single-track planned administration still apply for 
export licenses from MOFTEC's Quota and License Affairs 
Administration), and the word "samples" must be clearly stated 
on licenses. For samples valued at more than 10,000 yuan, the 
issue of export licenses is handled according to normal 
regulations of trade administration. 
  3) Cases of shipping out samples of traditional Chinese 
crude 
drugs and Chinese medicine are still handled according to 
Customs' regulations of value restriction. 
  Article XV. Administration of exporting goods and 
materials to foreign countries as economic aid 
  Customs can clear various goods and materials exported in 
the 
name of projects of giving economic and technical aid to foreign 
countries after examining MOFTEC's letters on entrusting 
enterprises the task of aiding foreign countries or invoicing 
notices issued by the China National Complete Sets of Equipment 
Import and Export Corporation on external aid projects and 
customs declarations of export goods filled in by enterprises 
taking on the task of aiding foreign countries. If units 
providing and transporting goods and materials export goods and 
materials not intended for external aid in the name of granting 
goods and materials to foreign countries as economic aid, these 
cases should be handled by Customs according to the customs law. 
  Article XVI. Export administration on the question of 
tolerance 
  According to international trade practice, it is considered 
normal if the tolerance of large batches of goods in bulk is 
within a five percent limit, and license-issuing organs will not 
indicate it when issuing licenses and Customs will clear the 
goods. For goods exceeding the five percent limit, 
license-issuing organs should increase the number of licenses 
issued and deduct them from the planned quotas accordingly when 
issuing licenses. 
  Article XVII. Regulations on punishment 
  When applying for export licenses, export units must furnish 
authorities with real conditions in all respects. Moreover, 
they are strictly prohibited from exporting, without 
authorization, goods which they do not have quotas for or which 
exceed their quotas or reporting unreal situations and using 
such means as fake contracts and fake letters of credit to gain 
export licenses by cheating. Reselling or transferring export 
licenses in any form is strictly prohibited. Violations of the 
regulations will be punished in order of importance, such as 
circulating notices to criticize violators, seizing their 
foreign exchange, or suspending or abolishing the right of 
running an export business or issuing licenses. Once 
discovering the above-mentioned violations of the regulations of 
export license administration when doing supervisory work, 
Customs should handle them in strict accordance with relevant 
customs laws and regulations. Those who forge export licenses 
and documents, inflict heavy loss upon the state, and violate 
criminal law will be transferred to judicial organs to 
investigate and affix their responsibility for the crimes. 
  Article XVIII. Any stipulations and methods of export 
license administration previously issued by MOFTEC which are 
inconsistent with these regulations are subordinate to the 
latter. 
  Article XIX. These regulations are effective from 1 April 
1994. MOFTEC is responsible for their interpretation.

<F P=106> [Article by Forestry Minister Xu Youfang: "Forestry </F>
Shoulders Great Mission of Environment and Development"] 
  [Text] The improvement of the ecology is a strategic issue 
confronted by the whole world and by China as well. Forestry is 
shouldering the great mission of improving the environment and 
promoting development and is playing a vital role in improving 
the ecology and bringing about sustained growth. 
  Forests are major natural resources which are indispensable 
for human development. Judging from the above two most 
essential characteristics, the building of forestry involves two 
strategic issues: 1) As main bodies of the ecosystem on land, 
forests build and refine the earth's ecology and maintain the 
most basic conditions for subsistence of human being. 2) As a 
key to bringing about sustained growth, forests are of extremely 
momentous strategic significance to the sustained economic 
development of mankind, and, in particular, to the developing 
countries in their endeavor to extricate themselves from poverty. 
  Soil erosion is one of the most important environmental 
problems faced by mankind and is therefore called a global 
crisis. The destruction of forest vegetation is the source that 
has caused serious soil erosion in the whole world. At present, 
the forest coverage rate throughout the world is only 25.08 
percent, and one-third of the land on earth has been seriously 
eroded. The only way to resolve this problem is to rebuild 
forest vegetation all over the world. 
  Desertification is the most serious of the 10 major 
environmental problems in the world. At present, 35 percent of 
the world's land area has already or is becoming desert, and 
economic losses caused by this have exceeded $40 billion a year. 
This means that one-third of the land on earth has lost or 
basically lost conditions favorable to human subsistence, and 
this area is constantly expanding. Therefore, extension of 
forest vegetation into deserts to recover the conditions for 
human subsistence has become one of the most important and 
arduous tasks faced by the entire world. 
  Too much water causes disasters, but too little water gives 
rise to anxieties. The fundamental cause lies in the serious 
shortage of forest resources. Scientific research at home and 
abroad shows that forests absorb rainfall like a "sponge," stop 
or reduce the currents of flood water, and prolong water flow in 
dry seasons. Hence, forests have the dual functions of 
preventing floods and drought. 
  Serious destruction of forests has damaged the genetic bank 
of some species. At present, there are approximately 3,956 
species on the verge of extinction, 3,647 species in peril, and 
7,240 species that are rare due to the sharp decrease in the 
number of varieties. Protection of forests, therefore, has 
become a major subject of maintaining diversification of living 
things. 
  Serious destruction of forests is also one of the major 
factors leading to poverty. Currently there are approximately 
250,000 babies born all over the world each day. This drastic 
population increase has forced people to make unrestrained 
demands on nature. But the deteriorating environment has made 
densely populated areas even poorer. At present, environmental 
refugees throughout the world have increased to more than 30 
million, and the deterioration of the ecology has thrown 
impoverished countries and regions into a difficult situation in 
terms of environment and sustained economic development. It is 
thus obvious that protection of forests, development of 
forestry, and improvement of the ecology have become 
comprehensive and vital issues for humans and human society. 
  The building of forestry in China has been seriously heeded 
by the party and government for a very long time. The party's 
Central Committee and the State Council have included 
afforestation and improvement of the ecology as basic national 
policies. Over the past 10 years or so, prominent comrades of 
the central authorities have taken the lead in participating in 
tree-planting activities as ordinary citizens every year and 
have set brilliant examples for the entire people. In the 
meantime, China has deliberately formulated and practiced a 
series of policies, laws, regulations, and measures in forestry, 
so that the building of forestry in China has entered the orbit 
of steady development. 
  Through the collective efforts of the people throughout the 
country, China's building of forestry has undergone great 
historic changes. Since 1981, people taking part in voluntary 
activities of afforestation have exceeded 3.4 billion 
person-hours, and a grand total of 18 billion trees has been 
planted. In recent years, an area of approximately 80 million 
mu was afforested throughout the country each year. There are 
no more barren hills in Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan now, for 
which these provinces have been commended by the party Central 
Committee and State Council. This year, some more provinces and 
autonomous regions will have their barren hills planted with 
trees. Considerable progress has been made in the construction 
of seven key forestry projects throughout the country so that 
the basic framework of ecological construction in China has 
taken shape. With the scope of afforestation continuously 
expanding, the quality has been notably enhanced too. 
  After 
verification, the total area of qualified afforestation reached 
285 million mu during the past five years, and the rate of 
acceptable quality rose from 65.6 percent in 1988 to 84.5 
percent in 1992. Exhaustion of forest resources has also been 
effectively controlled. According to the fourth nationwide 
screening of forest resources between 1989 and 1993, China's 
forest resources have shown a tendency of steady growth. 
  However, the tasks of building forestry in our country are 
still extremely arduous. On the one hand, China is still a 
country with very few trees, as the forest coverage rate is only 
13.92 percent, which is lower than the world average, and the 
level of per-capita forest area is even lower. At present, 
there are still quite a lot of barren hills and waste land 
around the country which must be afforested, and vast area of 
desert and land becoming desert must be harnessed. On the other 
hand, owing to insufficient forests, problems concerning the 
ecology are still very grim, as one-half of the country's 
population, one-third of cultivated land, and major large cities 
are below water level along rivers in flood season so that the 
areas in which industrial and agricultural output value accounts 
for two-third of the country's total are threatened by floods. 
According to statistics, approximately 500 million mu of farm 
land have been hit by various kinds of natural calamities in 
China. To put an end to this situation once and for all, the 
most important thing is to further enhance the green ecological 
and environmental awareness of the entire society, vigorously 
intensify the construction of forests, consistently increase 
forest vegetation, fully exercise the role of forests as 
ecological shelters, and make the most of their multiple 
functions and effectiveness. 
  The voices for the development of forestry are louder and 
louder in the contemporary world, and the demands on forestry 
construction for China's modernization drive are higher and 
higher too. As a primary mission and central element of 
environmental building, forestry should make contributions not 
only to ameliorating the ecology, but to getting rid of poverty 
and advancing toward a moderate prosperity for the masses in 
mountain areas, as well as to creating a fine investment climate 
and promoting the building of spiritual civilization to 
facilitate the endeavor of opening up to the outside world. We 
should persist in taking the road of building forestry with 
Chinese characteristics, aim at the goal of achieving high 
yield, fine quality, great efficiency, and sustained growth for 
forestry and, centering around the two major themes of reform 
and development, comprehensively fulfill the goal of struggle 
set for forestry development in the 1990's. That is, by the 
year 2000, all barren hills will be basically planted with trees 
in 21 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the 
forest coverage rate across the country will reach approximately 
15.3 percent. Besides, the country's total output value in 
forestry will increase to 304 billion yuan from 140 billion yuan 
at present.

<F P=106> ["Special report" on interview with Chen Jiyuan, director of </F>
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Institute of Rural 
Development, by staff reporter Sun Hanting (1327 3352 0080): 
"Chen Jiyuan Discusses Current Deep-Seated Problems Facing 
China's Agriculture"] 
  [Text] What are the deep-seated problems facing China's 
agriculture? How can we solve these problems? In an interview 
with this magazine, Chen Jiyuan, expressed the following 
viewpoints. 1. We should thoroughly change our basic attitude 
toward agriculture and the peasants. For a long time, the 
peasants have been required to contribute grain and various 
kinds of farm produce. All the more, the agricultural 
accumulation fund has been turned into an industrial 
accumulation fund and rural accumulation fund has been turned 
into an industrial development fund by means of scissors 
differences. Now that we have put forward the "grain sack 
project" and the "vegetable basket project," our starting point 
is to take them as key moves to ensure supply and curb 
inflation. Our starting point is still on how to stabilize the 
cities and solve the "grain sack" and "vegetable basket" 
problems of urban residents. It is of course necessary to raise 
this issue. However, if we only think of solving the problems 
of the urban residents without taking into consideration the 
peasants' benefits and their "money bag" problem, i.e. their 
income problem, then the "grain sack" and "vegetable basket" 
problems will not be solved once and for all. For a long time, 
there has actually been a sharp contradiction in rural work, 
that is, the state needs grain while the peasants need income. 
The peasants are required to fulfill the task of supplying 
grain but the problem of their income is often neglected. We 
can say that this is the most deep-seated problem facing China's 
agriculture. If we only think of urban needs, urban stability, 
and the interests of urban residents; keep asking the peasants 
for supplies without thinking of giving them anything; and if we 
do not set to work to solve this problem but let things continue 
like this, it will be difficult for agriculture to continue to 
grow steadily. Although we can practice the responsibility 
system for leaders at all levels and make it the obligation and 
duty of the peasants to grow grain, it can only help solve the 
problem for the time being and cannot solve the fundamental 
problems facing China's agriculture. 
  2. We should raise our understanding of the strategical 
position of agriculture in the national economy. We should say 
our leaders at all levels have talked enough about the 
importance of agriculture. They have talked about it for 
decades from the 1950's till now. However, the guiding 
principle and policies of the central authorities have not been 
implemented. So, there is a deep-seated problem here, i.e. for 
a long time we have overlooked the strategy for agricultural 
development. 
  The practice of using the goal of quadrupling the GNP by the 
end of this century as a principal index for assessing the 
achievements made by local governments and cadres is worth 
discussing. It is a main factor in causing the tendency to 
neglect agriculture because agriculture has the lowest 
comparative advantage and its total output value is also the 
lowest as compared with other industries. To achieve a lot and 
to be successful, localities and cadres, of course, will take 
firm hold of the industry having high output value. Agriculture 
is undoubtedly put in a negligible position because of its low 
output value. In the past, we always published the growth rate 
of the total output value of all provinces and cities in 
newspapers at the end of each year. Those cadres whose province 
or city fell behind would feel the pressure. When this pressure 
changed into action, these cadres would neglect agriculture. 
So, we must change the practice of assessing the achievements 
of localities and cadres by means of quotas and break away from 
the assessment method of using growth rate of total output value 
as a key indicator and an important basis. If we do not proceed 
from this, it will not be possible to solve the problem of 
neglecting agriculture. 
  Besides the abovementioned reason, there is also a 
structural 
aspect. For a long time past we practiced the policy that 
localities were responsible for their finances. As a result, 
the localities paid attention to whichever industry yielded high 
profits. However, agriculture was not on their list for 
consideration. That is why we should gradually solve the 
structural aspect by deepening the reform. 
  3. It is necessary to consider whether we should change from 
the practice of nurturing industry with agriculture into the 
practice of supporting agriculture with industry. We should 
consider whether China's economy has reached such a stage, 
namely, the stage of changing from the practice of nurturing 
industry with agriculture into one of supporting agriculture 
with industry. In other words, we should consider whether the 
time for such a change has come. It is a problem worthy of our 
consideration. In the course of its development, a developing 
country usually will have to go through the stage in which 
agriculture nurtures industry. As industry develops and grows, 
in due course it will become strong enough to support 
agriculture. Then it will change into another stage. As for 
the development of China, it is very clear that industrial 
development has depended on and been nurtured by agricultural 
accumulation for a long time. At the beginning of our 
industrialization it was necessary and a way that we had to 
take. Now it is time for us to take into consideration the 
question whether China's economy should change into the stage of 
industry supporting agriculture as our industry has grown 
through decades of development. Viewed from the following three 
points, the condition for such a change has initially matured. 
  First, fundamental changes have taken place in the 
structure of industrial and agricultural output value. At the 
beginning of socialist construction, industrial output value 
accounted for 30 percent while agricultural output value 
accounted for 70 percent. Having gone through several decades 
of construction and development, industrial output value now 
accounts for over 70 percent while agricultural output value 
accounts for only 20-plus percent. 
  Second, the income disparity between urban and rural 
residents has grown bigger. During the more than 10 years of 
reform, the disparity was once reduced; now, however, not only 
has it returned to the previous situation but it is bigger than 
the disparity at the beginning of the reform, growing from over 
two times to over three times. Generally, in the course of 
modernization of developing countries, the disparity between 
cities and countryside is around 40 percent. In the ROK, where 
the disparity is the biggest, it is only around 60 percent. If 
we allow the situation of undermining agriculture to go on and 
fail to support agriculture with industry, it will lead to the 
intensification of social contradictions. 
  Third, we are now in a stage of comprehensive restructuring, 
changing from the system of planned economy into one of market 
economy. As agriculture is an industry with a weak 
constitution, its contradictions are becoming more prominent. 
Under the condition of market economy, agriculture needs 
support and aid from the state. Covered up by the planned 
economy, the contradictions of agriculture as an industry with a 
weak constitution did not manifest themselves sharply. Since 
the practice of market economy, the low comparative advantage of 
agriculture has been sharply reflected through the peasants 
themselves. It does not mean that there were no contradictions 
in the past. At that time, under the system of everybody eating 
from the same big pot, this contradiction did not manifest 
itself. Now, under such a new situation, if we do not shift the 
economy to the stage of industry supporting agriculture in a 
timely fashion, we shall not be able to meet the requirement of 
making a switch-over. 
  In terms of the abovementioned three points, the conditions 
for making a switch-over have matured. However, this is a very 
big issue and, therefore, we should study and explore it well at 
theoretical level in conjunction with China's reality. 
Naturally, this change will be a gradual process and cannot be 
completed overnight. It is now time to raise this problem as 
our economy cannot always stay at the stage of agriculture 
supporting industry but should move forward. I think our 
understanding of this stage should be the basic starting point 
for us to formulate a series of rural polices. If we still 
think that we are still at the stage of agriculture supporting 
industry, then we will go on developing industry at the expense 
of agriculture. On the other hand, we are required to adopt a 
series of measures to support agriculture if we think that the 
stage of industry supporting agriculture has come. 
  Fourth, given the market economy, we should practice a 
protective policy on agriculture and particularly on grain 
production. The reason why agriculture needs protection is that 
it is an industry with a weak constitution. There are two 
reasons for this: 1. Agriculture mainly uses biological type 
technology and, to a large extent, is subject to natural 
elements. So it is difficult for it to compete with mechanical 
industries which are less subject to natural elements. 2. 
Agriculture is run on a small scale with a low level of 
socialization. Usually, its operational units are based on 
households. It is difficult for it to compete with industries 
which have a high level of socialization and are managed in an 
enterprise style. Therefore, under the condition of market 
economy, those countries practicing market economy adopt, with 
exceptions, a protective policy toward agriculture. China 
should not be an exception either. 
  There now exists a different viewpoint which holds that 
agriculture, including grain production, should be arranged in 
accordance with the principle of comparative advantage. That 
is, China will grow whichever crop has a high comparative 
advantage and will abandon growing those crops with a low 
comparative advantage. Instead, it will depend on imports. This 
is not realistic. In China, grain is not an ordinary farm 
product but a product of strategical significance. Therefore, 
our basic standpoint is to be basically self-sufficient. Of 
course, we can import for the sake of variety. There are two 
reasons for us to say it is not realistic: 1. It is not 
realistic from the economical point of view. The annual world 
trade of grain amounts to 100 million tonnes. If China imports 
a large amount of grain, it will make grain prices rocket on the 
world market. 2. As a strategic product, grain has its 
political significance. It is dangerous to depend on others to 
feed our nation. So it is highly necessary to adopt a 
protective policy toward agriculture and especially grain. 
  Currently, the biggest problem is that the prices of grain 
and other farm produce cannot catch up with the prices of 
agricultural factors of production. The peasants do not 
increase their income while increasing agricultural production. 
Under such circumstances, if we do not take protective 
measures, it is certain that the peasants will not use, or use 
less, agricultural factors of production. Enterprises producing 
agricultural factors will also vent their grievances endlessly. 
Chemical fertilizer plants complain about their losses and so 
do agricultural machinery plants. Even though they lose money, 
the peasants still cannot afford to buy them. How can they buy 
if the prices of the agricultural factors of production are 
raised again? A dilemma then presents itself: Who to protect? 
To protect both the peasants and enterprises or just one of 
them is a serious policy choice. It is difficult to protect 
both. If we set limits on the prices of the agricultural 
factors of production, the maximum price limit actually turns 
out to be the minimum limit. All the more, the peasants should 
be subsidized. The correct choice is to liberalize one, that 
is, to liberalize the prices of agricultural factors of 
production. Let them follow market development and enter the 
market economy. Those good enterprises will survive while the 
poor ones will be eliminated through competition in the market 
economy. The peasants should be subsidized for the use of 
machines and diesel. Moreover, we can adopt the method of 
raising prices and bring into play the price leverage. In 
recent years, the prices of farm produce have increased quite a 
bit but, despite the present price level, they cannot offset the 
cost of production. The current price of rice has risen to 0.8 
to 1 yuan, which is equal to O.5 yuan in 1989 when inflation is 
taken into consideration. However, it rose to 1.5 yuan in 
Guangdong in 1989. It seems necessary to raise the prices of 
farm produce to protect agriculture but the effects are limited 
because prices cannot be raised endlessly. The prices of our 
farm produce are already near the prices in international 
markets. It is very difficult to raise them higher than the 
prices in international markets so more consideration should be 
given to the subsidy method. Another way is to offer loans. The 
loans provided for the peasants should be preferential ones. We 
cannot offer them loans with ordinary interest rates. 
Industries can accept loans with ordinary interest rates but 
not the peasants. 
  Fifth, we should enlarge the operational scale of 
agriculture. The operational scale of our agriculture is too 
small. When compared with Japan and Taiwan, let alone with 
those countries with a vast territory and a sparse population, 
it still has a long way to go. In Japan, it is 1.5 hectare 
while in China, with households as a basic unit, it is 0.43 
hectare. It is not possible to increase agricultural labor 
productivity with such an operational scale. To enlarge the 
operational scale of agriculture, we need to solve the problem 
of transferring the surplus labor in agriculture. If we fail to 
do so, it will be impossible to enlarge the scale. Without 
developed nonagricultural industries and without developed 
township and town enterprises, it will be difficult to enlarge 
the scale. To develop township and town enterprises, we should 
support labor-intensive industries and strengthen their 
competitive strength. 
  In short, we will never solve the problems facing China's 
agriculture only through emphasizing the leader responsibility 
system and defining grain production as the peasants' obligation 
and duty. Instead, we should give the abovementioned problems 
comprehensive consideration and make a great change in our 
general way of thinking and the whole policy decision. This is 
an urgent demand of agriculture under the condition of market 
economy. It is also a new way of thinking for tackling the 
deep-seated problems facing our agriculture.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 11 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China has 
taken a series of steps to increase grain output this year. 
  Latest figures show that the seeded area this spring in 
Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces increased by nearly 
one million hectares, including 400,000 hectares of beans and 
wheat, and more high-yielding crops such as corn and rice were 
sown. 
  This will increase the grain output in the region by an 
estimated 7.2 billion kg this year, said a local grain 
production planning official. 
  By mid-may, Heilongjiang Province had injected more than 
5.73 
billion yuan to boost its agricultural production. The major 
part of the funds -- 65.3 percent -- was raised by the farmers. 
  In Liaoning and Jilin, more money has been used to buy 
fertilizers. In addition, over 250 million cu m of manure has 
been applied in Liaoning and Heilongjiang. 
  Northeast China's total of cultivated land is 16 million 
hectares, and its rural population numbers 57 million. It is 
one of the country's biggest grain producers, with advanced 
mechanized farm machinery. 
  The region's overall grain output last year reached a record 
60 billion kg, accounting for 13 percent of the country's total.

  [Text] Kunming, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The Xishuangbanna 
Nature Reserve, China's major protection and research center for 
tropical and sub-tropical plants and animals, has stepped up 
co-operation with overseas organizations to better protect the 
precious animal and plant resources. 
  The nature reserve has been admitted to the international 
network of biosphere reserves of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) along with nine 
other such reserves in China. 
  Since 1988, it has co-operated with the worldwide fund for 
nature to protect wild elephants and study the breeding of 
insects, and the development of forestry and farming outside the 
reserve as well as the relationships between tourism and 
wildlife protection. 
  Meanwhile, it has started a training class in the management 
of wild animals in co-operation with experts from the 
association of wild animal protection of the United States. 
  Established in 1958 in a remote part of southwest China's 
Yunnan Province, and known as "the kingdom of plants", the 
nature reserve is made up of five linked reserves with a total 
area of 240,000 ha. 
  Specially designed to protect the local ecosystem of 
primeval 
forests, and rare animals and plants, the reserve boasts 4,000 
kinds of tropical forest and rain forest. So far, a total of 
341 wild plants are cultivated in the reserve, 52 of which are 
under special protection from the central government. 
  In addition, 99 wild animals in the reserve are under top 
protection from the Chinese Government. 
  Some 150,000 Chinese and foreign tourists, many of them 
experts and scholars, visited the reserve last year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Rong (2621 2837)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has given 
economic priority to the development of village and township 
industry. 
  Speaking at a recent meeting on exchanging experiences in 
village and township industry among Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, 
Hangzhou, and four other cities, Jiang Yiren, vice mayor of 
Shanghai in charge of village and township industry, said: 
Shanghai's industrial development "will be bolstered by two 
factors: the development of Pudong and village and township 
industry." 
  According to statistics, increased output value turned out 
by 
Shanghai's 15,000 village and township enterprises has exceeded 
50 percent of the municipality's annual increased output value 
of industry since 1988, reaching 53 percent in 1993, while the 
increase of their export trade exceeded 40 percent of the 
municipality's increased export trade volume last year. 
  According to well-informed economists, Shanghai's village 
and 
township industry, as the "huge reservoir" for major urban 
industrial readjustment, should gradually eliminate the 
condition of "chimneys in every village," set up small 
industrial zones, raise investment returns, and coordinate 
development with major industries in a systematic manner. 
  Shanghai's village and township industry will be highlighted 
by an "export-oriented" feature in the second half of the 
1990's. By inducing foreign capital and technology and 
expanding foreign trade, the municipality will gradually combine 
its advantage in suburban labor with imported technology and 
capital and foreign trade in forming a "joint force" and 
striving to make village and township industrial export trade 
constitute at least 30 percent of the municipality's total 
export volume within two or three years.

  [Text] Municipal government departments concerned recently 
held a meeting on general price inspection to further relay and 
implement the guidelines of the national work conference on 
general inspection of commodity prices and to make full 
arrangements for deepening price inspection across the city. 
  It has been learned that the municipal commodity prices 
department has over the past two days dispatched nearly 1,000 
personnel in a campaign concentrating on prioritized checks. 
Results of the inspection show that an absolute majority of 
state-run and collectively run grain, oil, and sauce stores have 
managed to observe state provisions, while a small number of 
shops were caught overpricing and entertaining only 
large-quantity purchases. 
  To ensure stability of commodity prices on the market, the 
municipal government demanded that strong measures be taken to 
strengthen inspection and to carry on the municipality-wide 
general inspection of commodity prices in a down-to-earth and 
in-depth manner. 
  The government's specific demands on commodity prices 
departments at all levels are: 1. They should further 
strengthen price administration in cooperation with departments 
in charge of different trades. Without prior approval, no 
department or unit should introduce any form of price hike for 
commodities and fees that are under state control or for which a 
price hike application is required. They should sternly punish 
violators of relevant provisions and go a step further to expose 
to the public, individual cases of a serious and odious nature 
that have a widespread impact. 2. They should resolutely 
prohibit, investigate, and deal with price hikes based on 
invalid excuses. Acts of exploiting the opportunity of reform 
to unscrupulously and covertly raise prices should be sternly 
dealt with in accordance with the law. 3. They should keep the 
chain effect strictly in check and sternly deal with price hikes 
or the expansion of profit margin without approval. And, 4. 
They should strengthen inspection of prices at the marketplace.

<F P=106> [Article by Ruan Chongwu, provincial party secretary and </F>
governor, entitled: "Conscientiously Implement the Program for 
Reform and Development of Education in China and the Teachers' 
Law So as To Promote the Development of Educational Undertakings 
in Our Province"] 
  [Text] In February last year, the CPC Central Committee 
and the State Council promulgated the Program for Reform and 
Development of Education in China. This was a matter of 
fundamental importance to the promotion of educational 
development in the motherland, as well as the modernization of 
society as a whole. In November of the same year, the state 
again promulgated the PRC Teachers' Law, which officially came 
into effect as of 1 January this year. This shows that the 
development of the teaching contingent in our country has been 
brought onto the tract of legalization and standardization. 
Conscientiously implementing this Program and this Law has a 
direct bearing on the training of qualified personnel, and is an 
important matter of strategic importance for construction in our 
large special economic zone [SEZ]. This is also a heavy task of 
the CPC Committees and governments at all levels which are 
striving to attain their short-term target. 
  Since the promulgation of the Program and the Law, 
governments and educational departments at all levels in our 
province have done a lot of work to enforce them. Investment in 
education has been increased by a bigger margin. In 1993, 
educational spending covered by our province's budget was 26.8 
percent higher than in 1992. Investment in education accounted 
for 17.7 percent in our financial expenditure, and 3.3 percent 
in the GDP of our province. This was higher than the average 
level of the whole country. In 1993, multichannel spending on 
school buildings for secondary and primary schools throughout 
the province reached 333.9 million yuan. Special allocation for 
secondary vocational education reached 39.34 million yuan. All 
these investments were the highest in Hainan over the years. 
  We have adjusted our educational plans to accelerate the 
pace 
of popularizing our nine-year compulsory education. It has been 
decided that the nine-year compulsory education should be 
basically popularized throughout the province by 1997, with the 
exception of some difficult areas inhabited by minority 
nationalities. We plan to basically wipe out illiteracy among 
teenagers and youths, and to promote various kinds of 
educational reforms. New dimensions are being opened up to 
simultaneously develop various kinds of schools, including 
schools run by the government, schools run by local people, 
schools run jointly by the government and local people, and 
schools based on investment from abroad and lateral links at 
home, and others. The situation of using varied ways to develop 
education has been initially created. There have been more 
units selected to carry out experiments in the reform of 
schools' internal management system. Conscientious efforts are 
being made to do practical and beneficial work for teachers. 
Various cities and counties have done a lot of work with regard 
to the problems facing teachers, including houses, salaries, 
medical service, and jobs for their children. They also have 
done a lot to make teachers in people-run schools become regular 
teachers, and to improve welfare for teachers in people-run 
schools, and for substitute teachers as well. 
  However, we also should realize that there still are many 
problems and difficulties facing our province's education, and 
we must pay sufficient attention to them. For instance, the 
fact that our educational system does not conform with our 
economic structural reform gradually has manifested itself. 
Training of qualified personnel has lagged far behind the 
demands of the rapid development in our large SEZ. Our teaching 
contingent has not become stable enough. To truly solve these 
problems, on the previous basis of implementing the Program and 
the Law, we should further sum up our experiences, take more 
measures, and do a solid job for the implementation of the 
Program and the Law. With the further establishment and 
operation of the economic system in our SEZ's market, we 
urgently need a large number of professionals who have a fine 
ideological and moral character, have profound professional 
knowledge, and are good at making policy decisions, doing 
management work, and [words indistinct] in accordance with 
market economic law in the interest of the adjustment of our 
economic and industrial structure. In the meantime, we also 
urgently need to train a large quantity of middle-ranking and 
junior skilled technicians, and laborers working in the 
forefront to thoroughly optimize our investment environment. 
  Governments at all levels throughout the province must have 
far-sighted views, and must treat the training of qualified 
personnel as a fundamental project for developing our socialist 
market economy. We should follow a down-to-earth manner in order 
to solve some difficulties and problems, and should do some 
solid work in the interest of education. We should make 
persistent efforts to grasp well the work of implementing the 
Program and the Law. The emphasis in implementing the program 
and the law is laid on basically popularizing our nine-year 
compulsory education, and wiping out illiteracy among teenagers 
and youths in the 1990's. 
  Educational departments must do a conscientious job in 
making budgets and formulating plans involving teachers' 
salaries, school funds, school buildings, equipment, and 
facilities. In addition, city and county governments must grasp 
well the work of implementing relevant plans for developing 
basic education, and compulsory education in particular. They 
also must do well the work of ensuring teachers' salaries, and 
carrying out assessment and examination of educational 
development. All townships, towns, and villages must be truly 
responsible for improving local conditions for running schools 
to ensure that school-aged children and teenagers can start 
school on schedule, and that the majority of these children will 
not discontinue their schooling. 
  It is necessary to protect, according to law, the legitimate 
rights and interests of schools, teachers, and students. It is 
necessary to speed up and deepen internal management reform in 
various schools to ensure the establishment of their vigorous 
and dynamic operational mechanisms. Course content must be 
based on practice. Schools should be run by various different 
institutions or individuals. It is necessary to follow 
different patterns and forms for running schools. It is 
necessary to deepen the reforms involving the recruitment of new 
students for universities and colleges, secondary vocational 
schools, tuition fees, and job assignments for graduates. The 
responsibilities of the state and of society with regard to 
education must be linked. It is necessary for us to actively 
support work-study programs and school-run industries so as to 
increase income in the interest of the development of education. 
It is necessary for us to continue to implement the guideline 
of relying on the people to run education. It is necessary for 
us to continue the practice of raising funds to run schools on a 
voluntary basis, and not overrating one's ability. It is 
necessary to encourage people to donate money to support schools. 
  We must make efforts to enhance the ideological, political, 
and professional quality of our teaching contingent. We must 
energetically encourage the practice of respecting teachers and 
attaching importance to education so as to protect teachers' 
rights and interests, and to improve their pay and conditions. 
The key to implementing the Program and the Law lies in taking 
a matter-of-fact attitude. CPC Committees and governments at 
all levels throughout the province must proceed from their own 
local conditions to do some excellent work to make achievements 
in developing education.

"`Two Leaps' in China's Rural Reform and Development"] 
  [Text] Comrade Xiaoping once pointed out: "From a 
long-term point of view, reform and development of China's 
socialist rural areas may experience two leaps. The first leap 
is to abolish the system of people's communes and adopt the 
contracted responsibility system on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output. This is tremendous progress, and 
we must unswervingly uphold the new practice for a long time to 
come. The second leap will come when we successfully adapt 
ourselves to the needs of scientific farming and socialized 
production, expand agricultural operations to an appropriate 
scale, and promote the collective economy. This is additional 
great progress which can only be accomplished through a long 
process." 
<H5>  I. "First Leap" in Rural Reform and Development Brought </H5>
About an Historic Change in Rural Economy. 
  As a result of the abolition of the system of people's 
communes and the adoption of the contracted responsibility 
system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, 
the rural productive forces have been brought well into line 
with production relations, rural households are gradually 
becoming a primary main body of the production and operation of 
commodities, productive forces have been freed and developed, 
the micro structure of the rural economy has experienced 
fundamental change, and miraculous growth has been registered in 
all major indicators of the rural economy. At present, the 
progress of the rural reform is giving impetus to urban reform, 
while the latter, in return, is pushing forward the former. The 
organic integration of urban and rural reform has opened up a 
new chapter in the history of rural economic development. The 
rural economic structural reform has not only brought 
comprehensive development to the rural economy, but also given 
mighty support to the rapid growth of the entire national 
economy. It has not only changed the economic and social 
structures of rural areas, but also provided us with useful 
experience in shifting the highly concentrated planned economic 
structure toward a socialist market economic structure. And it 
has not only brought benefits to peasants, but also provided 
them with democracy. The effective realization of the "first 
leap" in China's rural reform and development has laid a sound 
foundation for eliminating the backwardness and poverty of rural 
areas, and for providing peasants with sufficient food and 
clothing and then helping them attain a "fairly comfortable 
life." 
<H5>  II. "Sudden Emergence and Rapid Development" of Township </H5>
and Town Enterprises Is an Inevitable Result of Realization of 
the "First Leap," Thus Opening Up Broad Prospects for 
Industrialization and Urbanization of Rural Areas. 
  Thanks to the adoption of the contracted responsibility 
system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, 
rural labor productivity was enhanced rapidly, and large numbers 
of rural labor forces were freed. Under the then situation of a 
lagging urbanization process, it was an inevitable result of the 
"first leap" that these freed labor forces were shifted to 
township and town enterprises as well as to tertiary industries. 
The development of township and town enterprises has not only 
brought peasants bigger income and accelerated the shift of 
rural labor forces, but it has also gradually turned the rural 
economy into a non-agricultural and urbanized economy, helped 
pure rural laborers develop themselves into professionals of a 
pluralistic society, and changed the unitary collective-owned 
economy into a diversified economy that relies mainly on the 
public ownership. As a product of the socialist market economy, 
township and town enterprises are gaining increasingly greater 
strength amidst market competition. Moreover, through their 
successful exploration of how to develop the socialist market 
economy, they have proved to be a new growth point in China's 
national economy, which is full of life and vitality. Alongside 
the rapid development of township and town enterprises, a number 
of new-type medium and small cities and townships are undergoing 
an expansion process. The present practice by which the 
majority of surplus rural labor forces are shifted to 
township-town enterprises and tertiary industries, while the 
minority make up the deficiencies of the urban manpower, has 
accelerated China's urbanization process and brought about a 
fundamental change in the dualistic urban-rural structure. What 
is more, it has also helped the rural market to develop from a 
sealed regional market into an open market which exercises 
management by grouping enterprises and keeps well in line with 
the usual practices of both domestic and international markets. 
Some foreign experts have acclaimed China's township and town 
enterprises as another great miracle created by China's 
successful rural reform. 
  China has long been plagued by a situation in which the 
labor 
supply demand, a labor market has not yet taken shape, peasants 
are poorly informed, and the service system remains imperfect. 
As a result, peasants are swarming into cities blindly, 
creating various problems of urban management. These problems 
can only be solved through deepening of reform. On the other 
hand, due to its traditional covertness, the surplus rural labor 
power will not produce as huge a social pressure as that created 
by an unemployed urban population. However, we must not lower 
our guard. In 1993, the total number of China's surplus labor 
force in rural areas stood at about 120 million; yet by the year 
2000, China's rural labor force will total about 500 million, 
registering an average growth of 10 million new laborers each 
year. According to the statistics that an average of 5 million 
rural laborers have shifted to non-agricultural industries every 
year during the past 15 years, the surplus rural labor force 
will reach about 150 million with the addition of the present 
over 100 million. [figures as published] Failure to provide 
appropriate guidance to these surplus rural laborers will result 
in a huge waste of manpower and also many serious social 
problems. The only way to solve this problem is to gradually 
expedite the urbanization process of rural areas, turn 
agricultural labor power into non-agricultural manpower, reform 
the existing dualistic urban-rural residence management system 
step by step, put into practice a unified system on floating 
residences in both urban and rural areas, and give shape to a 
unified urban-rural labor market. 
<H5>  III. Gradually Realizing the "Second Leap" Is the Future </H5>
Orientation of Rural Reform and Development. 
  It is an historical process to advance gradually from the 
"first leap" to the "second leap." Since this process cannot be 
fulfilled completely in a brief space of time, there must be a 
transitional period which aims at further emancipating and 
developing productive forces. Changes have now taken place in 
the rural economic foundation, economic ties between urban and 
rural areas are becoming tighter, and rural economic reform is 
more exposed to the impact produced by other structural reforms, 
including fiscal and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign 
trade. Under such a situation, in order to bring about the 
"second leap" in rural reform, instead of conducting reform only 
in isolated individual fields, we should uphold the reform 
principle of "promoting the whole while making key 
breakthroughs" in accordance with the general design of 
urban-rural integration. Firstly, we will adapt ourselves to 
the demands of both domestic and international markets, and 
promote the comprehensive reform of the socialist market 
economic structure. We will apply appropriate policies to 
protect prices of major agricultural products and at the same 
time establish a system for stockpiling special-purpose grain 
reserves as well as risk funds for grain production. Secondly, 
we will adopt new policies for the readjustment of industrial 
and agricultural investment ratios. Third, efforts will be made 
to gradually unfold reform of the land system. Land contracts 
will be extended for another 30 years after their expiration, so 
that farmers have the right to use their land for a long period 
of time. To avoid the situation in which land operations are 
restricted to a small scale and land is divided into bits and 
pieces, which is not beneficial to scale operation and 
technological progress, we advocate during the land contract 
period of the method "increasing or decreasing the number of 
people without increasing or decreasing the land." Meanwhile, 
we will establish a land circulation market, thus creating 
conditions for extensive application of scientific and 
technological results and for the socialization of production. 
During the course of implementation, all localities are 
required to act in line with the realistic development levels of 
productive forces, work out measures in light of local 
conditions, provide guidance to different types of areas, adopt 
a positive and steady approach, and proceed in an orderly way. 
We should refrain from exercising rigid uniformity and applying 
fixed formulas, for history has shown that by hastily 
readjusting production relations regardless of real development 
levels, we are unable to fulfill the goal of developing 
productive forces and improving the material and cultural lives 
of the people. On the contrary, such practice will lead to a 
negative situation and sabotage productive forces to a serious 
extent.

  [Text] On 2 and 3 June, Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
National Committee, head of the United Front Work Department 
under the CPC Central Committee, and director of Taiwan Affairs 
Office under the State Council, carried out inspection work in 
Wuhan. During his stay in the city, he listened to the work 
reports of the city of Wuhan and of Hubei Province, and met with 
main responsible persons from various democratic parties, and 
the Wuhan branch of the Federation of Trade and Commerce. 
  Wang Zhaoguo said: A China craze is spreading in the world 
now. Many countries are amazed at China's economy, which has 
been developing very rapidly for 15 years running without 
considerable fluctuations. There are two main reasons 
contributing to this: First, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we 
have taken economic construction as a focus, and always have 
persisted in deepening reform and expanding opening up. Second, 
we have actively promoted the development of socialist democracy 
and politics, and have persisted in and developed our 
fundamental system of people's congresses so as to consolidate 
and improve our multi-party cooperation under the leadership of 
the CPC, and our political consultation. We have done our best 
to extensively arouse positive factors in various quarters, 
promote political consultation and democratic supervision, and 
enable democratic parties to participate in and discuss 
government and political affairs. This is a condition and 
guarantee for promoting social stability and economic 
development. 
  Wang Zhaoguo fully affirmed the achievements made by Hubei 
and Wuhan in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and 
in particular, their marked success in attracting investment 
from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Wang Zhaoguo stressed: 
Wuhan must give full play to its geographical strong point to 
vigorously attract foreign capital. It must support and help 
foreign businessmen run enterprises well. It must set a good 
example in this respect to attract more foreign investment. 
  Wang Zhaoguo particularly emphasized: It is of great 
importance to carry out economic and trade work related to 
Taiwan. This is beneficial to linking the feelings of the two 
sides of the straits, and to promoting their economic 
cooperation and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
  During his stay in Wuhan, Wang Zhaoguo also met with heads 
of 
Hong Kong's New World Group, the Sun Hung Kai Group, and the 
Henderson Group. He also inspected Wuhan's Tianhe International 
Airport, which is under construction, as well as a 
home-ownership project. He attended an inaugural ceremony for 
Hankou's Changxing Park, and a ceremony marking the completion 
of the airport highway project. 
  Those who accompanied Wang Zhaoguo on his inspection tour 
included Hu Deping, vice chairman of All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce; (Zhang Mengna), secretary general of the 
United Front Work Department under the CPC Central Committee; 
and responsible persons of the relevant departments.

  [Text] On the morning of 20 May, the Second Session of the 
Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress held the third 
plenary session at which it heard reports by Puqung, vice 
chairman of the autonomous regional people's congress standing 
committee; Bai Zhao [4101 6856], president of the autonomous 
regional higher people's court; and Lan Rifeng [5695 2480 0023], 
deputy chief procurator of the autonomous regional people's 
procuratorate, on the work carried out by their respective 
organizations. 
  Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, vice chairman of the autonomous 
regional people's congress and executive chairman of the 
presidium of the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress, chaired yesterday's session.

People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the session and 
was seated on the rostrum. 
  Other leaders seated on the rostrum included Chen Kuiyuan, 
Raidi, Gyaincain Norbu, Basang, Hu Yongzhu, Zi Cheng, Buqiong,

Jiangbailuosang, Yabxi Wangdui, Qiazha Qiangbachilie, Zhou 
Qishun, Yang Chaoji, Zhou Wenbi, and Zhang Zhu, as well as 
presidium members of the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet 
Autonomous Regional People's Congress. 
  Attending the session as observers were persons in charge of 
various general offices, bureaus, departments, committees, and 
offices under the autonomous regional government; persons in 
charge of various institutions of higher learning and the 
autonomous region's offices in inland China; and members 
attending the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference. 
  On behalf of the autonomous regional people's congress 
standing committee, Puqung delivered a work report in which he 
discussed at length the work carried out by the autonomous 
regional people's congress standing committee since the First 
Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress, as well as the major tasks to be carried out over the 
next year. 
  The report stated: Since the First Session of the Sixth 
Autonomous Regional People's Congress, the autonomous regional 
people's congress standing committee has, in accordance with the 
resolution passed at that session and under the autonomous 
regional party committee's leadership, actively advanced the 
drive toward establishing a socialist market economic structure, 
performed its constitutional and legal functions, and made new 
headway in all fields of work on the basis of work carried out 
by previous standing committees, while focusing on the central 
task of economic construction. In the space of over a year, it 
held nine regular meetings in accordance with the law, 
deliberated 17 work reports, enacted six regional laws and 
regulations, adopted six resolutions, and appointed or removed 
188 government functionaries. 
  Last year, the autonomous regional people's congress 
standing 
committee examined and approved the "Regulations of the Tibet 
Autonomous Region Governing Foreigners Who Come to Tibet for 
Mountaineering," the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region on 
Implementing the `Law of the People's Republic of China on 
Compulsory Education,'" the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous 
Region on Implementing the `Organic Law (for Trial 
Implementation) of the People's Republic of China on Villagers' 
Committees,'" and the "Measures of the Tibet Autonomous Region 
on Implementing the `Organic Law of the People's Republic of 
China on Urban Residents' Committees.'" It conducted initial 
deliberations of the "Regulations of the Tibet Autonomous Region 
on the Comprehensive Management of Public Security." Moreover, 
it conducted a preliminary review of existing laws and 
regulations, and adopted resolutions on revoking regional laws 
and regulations which were incompatible with the developments of 
the times. 
  To give more effective guidance to the elections of a new 
term of deputies to county and township people's congresses and 
to promote the construction of grass-roots political organs, the 
Standing Committee also adopted a "Decision on the Election 
Schedule of People's Deputies to County and Township People's 
Congresses." As a result of the elections in 1993, 6,411 
deputies to county and township people's congresses were elected 
directly by some 1.2 million voters throughout the region. 
  The report points out: Over the past year, deputies made a 
total of 94 suggestions. Of the six suggestions put on the 
record, five were taken care of, with the remaining one in the 
process of being handled. Replies were already given to 
deputies. In the past year, the Standing Committee actively 
organized deputies to conduct inspection in the vicinity and 
received some 40 inspection reports from them, which were of 
great help to the relevant departments in improving work. 
  The report emphasizes: The Standing Committee's main tasks 
in 1994 are: accelerating the pace of enacting laws and striving 
to keep legislation abreast with the progress of reform; 
energetically strengthening supervision to ensure the smooth 
implementation of various laws, regulations, and major reform 
programs; stepping up publicity of the legal system to enhance 
the whole society's awareness of laws; and continuing to improve 
the Regional People's Congress' work. 
  In the report on the work of the regional Higher People's 
Court, Bai Zhao said: In the past year, the regional Higher 
People's Court earnestly performed functions empowered by the 
Constitution and other laws. It accepted 3,092 cases; of these, 
the hearing was completed on 2,581 cases, thus dealing a harsh 
blow at separationists' sabotage activities, severely punishing 
criminal offenders who disrupted public order, striking 
relentlessly at serious economic crimes, and resolutely cracking 
down on corruption according to the law. In 1994, courts 
throughout the region will, with a view to stabilizing the 
situation and promoting economic development, fight unswervingly 
against separatism, continue to strike severely at various 
criminal offenders, step up efforts to try major and serious 
cases, especially economic crimes, and deepen the anticorruption 
drive. Moreover, in the process of readjusting economic 
relations, courts will earnestly safeguard the lawful rights and 
interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations. 
They will strictly enforce the law and raise the judicial 
quality so as to contribute to Tibet's economic development and 
social stability. 
  In the report on the work of the regional People's 
Procuratorate, Lan Rifeng said: In the past year, procuratorial 
organs in Tibet, led by the regional party committee and the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate, firmly implemented the party 
Central Committee's guidelines on the anticorruption drive and 
adhered to the principle of "strictly enforcing the law and 
resolutely handling cases" in striking harshly at a handful of 
separatists and serious criminal offenders; in concentrating 
efforts on investigating and punishing a number of major and 
serious cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic 
crimes; in investigating -- according to the law -- criminal 
cases involving infringement of rights [qin quan 0187 2938] and 
malfeasance [du zhi 3460 5120]; and in strengthening the 
supervision over law enforcement and the improvement of the 
quality of procuratorial personnel; thereby making fresh 
contributions to safeguarding the motherland's unification, to 
enhancing national unity, to maintaining social stability, to 
safeguarding reform, opening up, and the establishment of a 
socialist market economy, and to promoting socialist democracy 
and the legal system. 
  The report points out: This year, procuratorial organs in 
Tibet will continue to give top priority to harshly striking at 
a handful of separatists and serious criminal offenders 
according to the law; concentrate forces on handling major and 
serious cases in the anticorruption drive; continue to step up 
investigations and handling of "infringement of rights" and 
"malfeasance;" and further strengthen the functions of 
procuratorial organs in supervising law enforcement to ensure 
the correct implementation of state laws. They will also persist 
in improving the quality of people's procuratorates, strictly 
executing procuratorial duties, and raising the quality of 
procurators according to the law.

  [Text] On 9 June, the Propaganda Department and the 
Organization Department of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC 
Committee, the Work Committee for Regional Government Organs, 
and the Regional Bureau of External Propaganda held at the Tibet 
People's Hall their second report meeting on the current 
situation. 
  Cadres from propaganda and foreign affairs offices at and 
above the county and department level and cadres from other 
departments at and above the prefectural level attended the 
report meeting. 
  The meeting was presided over by (Du Tai), executive deputy 
director of the Propaganda Department of the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional CPC Committee. (Qu Jia), head of the Foreign Affairs 
Office of the Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Government, who 
personally attended the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights 
Committee, made a report to participants at the meeting on the 
situation of the international struggle for human rights. 
  (Qu Jia) said: The Chinese delegation once again smashed the 
scheme by the Western hostile forces and a small number of 
separatists at the international meeting to split China. Facts 
have once again proved that the force of righteousness will 
eventually defeat those ulterior motives. At the 50th meeting 
of the World Human Rights Committee, (Qu Jia) used his personal 
experience as a person of the Tibetan nationality to refute 
unbridled rumors and intentional slanders against the human 
rights situation in China's Tibetan region by a small number of 
people. 
  (Qu Jia) said: Some representatives of nongovernment 
organizations used rumors, which they themselves admitted to be 
unproven hearsay, to fabricate and distort the human rights 
situation in this autonomous region. They also cited documents 
of the so-called Tibetan government in exile. Therefore, people 
can easily see that their real intention was not their concern 
for human rights but rather their activities to split China by 
using the human rights issue. 
  What is the human rights situation in Tibet? Only the people 
in Tibet are highly qualified to make statements on this issue. 
People all know that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. 
Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, especially since the 
democratic reform in 1959, the human rights situation for the 
broad masses of people in Tibet has undergone a fundamental 
change. Great improvements have been made in economic and 
social development. The people's living conditions have been 
significantly improved. The customs and habits of people of 
Tibetan nationality have been respected, and the policy of 
freedom of religion has been fully implemented. 
  Various policies carried out in Tibet by the central 
government, especially a series of special policies especially 
formulated for Tibet in the last 10-odd years, have been greatly 
supported by the broad masses of people of Tibetan nationality. 
They have deeply realized that the past several decades have 
been the best period concerning the human rights situation in 
Tibet. The situation in Tibet can be seen by the people. If 
people take a just stand, they can certainly see the overall and 
genuine situation. 
  At the 50th meeting of the World Human Rights Committee, (Qu 
Jia) pointed out that in 1993, in addition to the touring of 
Tibet by some 30,000 foreigners and people from Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan, 344 people from 24 countries came to visit 
and inspect the situation in Tibet, including leading members of 
governments, parliaments, and political parties, as well as 
reporters and officials of foreign embassies and consulates in 
China. They have visited cities, villages, factories, schools, 
hospitals, and temples in Tibet and have held extensive contacts 
with people of various circles. After personally seeing the 
situation in Tibet, they generally recognized development and 
progress in Tibet. Even some people who had a considerable 
prejudice against the situation in Tibet cannot but say that 
only hearing a one-sided view on Tibet is not justifiable. 
  In presenting an introduction to the 50th meeting of the 
World Human Rights Committee on China's nationalities policy, 
(Qu Jia) emphatically pointed out that the Chinese Government 
always adheres to the policy of equality for all nationalities 
because this is a fundamental principle stipulated by the 
Chinese Constitution. In China, people of all nationalities, 
regardless of their total population, the extent of their social 
and economic development, and differences in customs, religious 
beliefs, and languages, all are equal in terms of their status 
and all enjoy equal rights and benefits. The Chinese Government 
has always made efforts to strengthen the unity and harmony of 
people of various nationalities in the country. In formulating 
political, economic, and social development policies, the 
Chinese Governments has paid special attention to protecting the 
rights of minority people. In handling nationality affairs 
work, the government will extensively solicit opinions of 
various related nationalities and do things through full 
consultation. Meanwhile, through enacting laws and adopting 
concrete measures, the government has guaranteed that people of 
various minority nationalities can take part in the 
administration of state and local affairs in various fields. 
  To help people of minority nationalities develop economic, 
cultural, and other social undertakings and to catch up with 
more developed regions as quickly as possible, the Chinese 
Government has always attached great importance to providing 
necessary assistance to minority peoples in terms of money, 
supplies, and manpower. In formulating plans for the 
development of the national economy, the Chinese Government has 
always adopted a policy of giving preferential treatment to the 
regions in which minority peoples reside. Meanwhile, the state 
has required and encouraged developed areas to help regions in 
which minority peoples reside, it has advocated mutual 
assistance between regions, and it has implemented the system of 
the regional autonomy of minority nationalities. The system of 
regional autonomy is an important political system stipulated by 
the Chinese Constitution to protect the rights and interests of 
people of minority nationalities. In areas in which people of 
minority nationalities reside, the state established autonomous 
organs to enable minority people to exercise their rights to 
administer the internal and local affairs of their own 
nationality. According to related stipulations of the Chinese 
Constitution and the Law of the People's Republic of China on 
National Regional Autonomy, the autonomous organs of various 
autonomous areas are state organs of local political power. In 
addition to the functions and power of other state organs of 
various provinces and municipalities, those organs also have 
autonomous power related to the political, economic, cultural, 
education, and other fields. The implementation of this system 
has protected various democratic rights of minority people and 
has promoted development in various fields in regions in which 
people of minority nationalities reside. China is a country 
with a legal system. Through the legislation of related laws, 
China has affirmed and protected the rights of minority people, 
guaranteed the equal position of various nationalities, and 
adjusted relations among various nationalities. At present, 
China has enacted laws to protect people of minority 
nationalities. These include nationwide laws such as the 
Constitution and the Law of the People's Republic of China on 
National Regional Autonomy, and local laws and regulations on 
self-autonomy formulated by various nationality autonomous 
areas. The contents of those laws and regulations cover 
minority people's political, economic, cultural, and educational 
fields, as well as their languages and religious beliefs. It 
can be said that China has in the main formed a legal system to 
protect various rights and interests of people of minority 
nationalities. 
  Facts speak louder than words. The practices over more than 
four decades have proved that China's policy for nationality 
affairs has achieved success. The international community will 
not be deceived by the lies spread by a small number of people 
in the world. Our government has always stressed and made great 
efforts to promote the human rights of all Chinese people, 
including the people of Tibetan nationality. The efforts and 
achievements cannot be denied by some lies by those people. 
  The report made by (Qu Jia) won warm applause from the 
participants. 
  At the report meeting, (Du Tai), executive deputy director 
of 
the propaganda department of the regional party committee, 
emphatically pointed out: Although we have repeatedly foiled 
the scheme of splitting the motherland by international hostile 
forces and a small number of separatists at home and abroad, we 
must not slacken our vigilance. We must strengthen our belief 
in our cause and fully understand the protracted and complicated 
nature of the struggle against separatism. We must not to the 
slightest degree slacken in our efforts.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Government Work Report delivered by </F>
autonomous regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second 
Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress; from the "News" program -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: We 
will vigorously develop educational services, and attain, by the 
turn of this century, the goals of building a middle school in 
every county and a primary school in every township, enrolling 
80 percent of school-age pupils, and satisfying the demand for 
qualified personnel in a socialist market economy. We will give 
priority to developing teachers' training, and nurture a reserve 
pool of professionally competent and politically reliable 
teachers. We should firmly foster the concept that science and 
technology are the primary productive forces, and that the 
economy should be developed through scientific and technological 
advances. While paying attention to research and development, 
we will accelerate the conversion of scientific and 
technological findings into productive forces, so that Tibet's 
economy will progressively shift toward the path of development 
based on scientific and technological advances. 
  We will take practical and feasible measures to keep the 
existing pool of qualified personnel stable by improving their 
living and working conditions, inspiring their initiative, and 
giving full scope to their intelligence and talent. We will 
encourage various qualified personnel to work at the grass-roots 
level and the forefront of production where they can display 
their abilities. We will implement preferential policies and 
adopt active measures to systematically or freely bring in all 
kinds of useful qualified personnel whom our region needs badly; 
to allow such personnel to work in one place or move freely from 
one place to another; and to employ them on a long-term or 
short-term basis with the goal of gradually expanding our pool 
of qualified personnel. 
  On creating a good social environment to ensure smooth 
progress in reform and development, the report said: We should 
consistently follow the principle of moving on two fronts 
simultaneously to keep the situation even more stable. We must 
wage a thoroughgoing antisplittist campaign. In fighting 
against splittism, we must firmly show faith in and rely on the 
masses, carry out publicity and organizational efforts among 
them, thoroughly expose splittists' plots, and constantly 
heighten public awareness of the need to combat splittism. We 
should resolutely crack down on disturbances and trouble plotted 
by splittist forces, to whom we should never show leniency. 
  We will bolster governments at the grass-roots level and 
conscientiously carry out mass work. Constantly improving the 
people's material and cultural standards is a fundamental goal 
of economic development, as well as the basis of government 
work. We should firmly foster the mass viewpoint, and go down 
to the grass roots and among the masses to carry out 
investigation and study, conduct business on the spot, solve 
problems, and provide work guidance to ensure smooth progress in 
reform and production.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "More foreigners flock to Beijing"] </F>
  [Text] Increasing numbers of foreigners have been settling 
in Beijing to work or study for more than a year at a time. 
  The number of foreigners issued the official green card 
increased by 30 percent last year. The total rose from 36,000 
in 1992 to more than 50,000 last year, police said this week. 
  The bulk of green card recipients are students, business 
people, and foreign experts. Police say they are drawn to China 
by its social and economic stability and rising living standards 
and opportunities. 
  The numbers of students from neighbouring and developing 
countries doubled to 2,000 in 1993. The number of specialists 
from developed countries soared from 3,000 in 1992 to more than 
6,800 in 1993. 
  Police said numerous foreign businessmen want to invest here 
because of improved legal protection. They also claimed that 
Beijing's low crime rate is a big drawing card for businesses 
looking to invest in a large international city. 
  Contrasting with the increase in long-term foreign 
residents, 
the number of Chinese going abroad from Beijing for personal 
reasons dropped more than 18 per cent. 
  According to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau 
(BMPSB), only 36,000 Beijing residents applied to emigrate, 
study, work, or visit families or relatives abroad in 1993. 
  That's a 10,000 person fall-off in one year, according to 
the 
bureau . 
  Sources said the city's policy to encourage students to make 
full use of their talents has been a leading factor in the 
decline of self-financed study abroad. 
  The drop occurred despite government efforts to make it 
easier for the capital's residents to apply for exit visas since 
1992. 
  The new rules ask police to approve applications within 30 
days. And the waiting period has decreased to about 20 days, 
said an officer with the bureau's Division of Aliens and 
Exit-Entry Administration. 
  Beijing police have been authorized to issue a permanent 
residence card for foreigners who make important contributions 
to economic development or cultural exchanges with other 
countries. 
  So far, few foreigners have received the right to stay 
longer 
than one year in Beijing--or to become honorary Chinese 
citizens, which allows them to stay as long as they wish. 
  In the last few years, the latter title was bestowed on 
several foreign experts who devoted themselves to the 
development of China's culture and economics, the officer said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A recent investigation 
has shown that Beijing's audio-video market is well in order 
after years of improvement and rectification. 
  The overall investigation into the market was jointly 
sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Radio, Film and 
Television, the Press and Publications Bureau, the Copyright 
Bureau, the Industry and Commercial Bureau, the Taxation Bureau 
and the Public Security Bureau. 
  Most sales departments dealing in audio-video products, 
especially XINHUA bookstores and foreign language bookstores, 
which are the main channels for publishing and selling 
audio-video products, are engaged in lawful business. 
  At present, Beijing has nearly one thousand sales outlets 
for 
audio products and seven hundred for visual products. There are 
80 professional audio-video presses and over 40 other book 
presses with the right to produce audio-video publications. In 
recent years, more than 400 video projection venues and over 500 
karaoke bars have been set up. Beijing's audio-video market is 
booming. 
  The reason for the healthy operation of Beijing's 
audio-video 
market is the close supervision by all government departments 
and the popularization of copyright knowledge. 
  A recent rush check on the sale of audio-video products was 
carried out by relevant government departments along the main 
commercial streets of Beijing. A number of tapes and compact 
discs in violation of copyrights were confiscated.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 11 (XINHUA) -- The total output value 
of the rural areas of this north China industrial port city in 
1993 hit 63 billion yuan, and the per capita annual income of 
farmers reached 1,593 yuan, increases of about 13 percent over 
the previous year. 
  About 600 villages in the suburban areas have become 
better-off ahead of time. They also have made great 
achievements in science and technology, education, culture, and 
in health care. 
  Meanwhile, township enterprises are mushrooming in the 
suburban areas. The city now has 30,800 township firms, 
employing 885,700 workers. The rural industrial output value 
accounts for 36 percent of the city's total. 
  Also, economic development zones at all levels have taken 
initial shape, and more than 100 projects in the zones have gone 
into operation. 
  The latest figures show that the overall rural industrial 
output value of the zones accounts for 36 percent of the city's 
total. Some 14 township enterprises engaged in metallurgy, 
machinery, chemicals and textiles have achieved a total annual 
output value exceeding one billion yuan each. 
  As rural industrialization progresses farmers have begun to 
turn their eyes from solely production to the market. Large 
numbers of business and trading companies which combine 
production and sales have been set up in the rural areas. 
  Each year the suburban counties provide the city with more 
than two billion kg of fresh vegetables. In addition, some of 
them have become processing centers for non-staple foodstuffs. 
  So far, Tianjin has built 44 satellite towns with all the 
necessary utilities and modern multifunctional buildings. 
  The majority of the suburban towns and villages have 
schools, 
hospitals, nurseries and entertainment centers. In Tianjin all 
the villages have electricity and running water. 
  In the rural areas about 95 percent of the farmers enjoy 
social welfare. The average per capita living space has reached 
nearly 18 sq m, and most farmers live in two-story houses. 
  Meanwhile, since the rural areas provide abundant labor and 
raw material resources, about 80 percent of the city's garment 
factories and several auto parts companies have been set up in 
the suburban areas.

  [Text] During his investigation and study in Hegang city on 
8 June, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
pointed out: The 16 foreign trade outlets which our province 
has built along Heilong Jiang are resources with tremendous 
potential. We should fully use these resources and turn them 
into multi-purpose ports linking up the waterways to form 
river-sea coordinated transport in an effort to bring along 
economic development in areas along Heilong Jiang. 
  Yue Qifeng said to leaders of Hegang city: Heilongjiang has 
treasures everywhere. The crucial issue involved is to pick up 
these treasures and turn them into economic advantages. He 
said: Hegang city is an industrial city with natural resources. 
To solve the current economic difficulties, first of all, we 
must rely on the efforts of the whole society. It is not 
realistic to rely only on the efforts of state-owned 
enterprises. We must comprehensively mobilize the endeavors of 
various economic sectors, such as collective enterprises, 
individual enterprises, joint-investment enterprises, 
neighborhood enterprises, and township enterprises, and let all 
levels and all forms of enterprises join efforts. 
  During his inspection tour to Nanshan Plywood Plant in 
Hegang 
city, Yue Qifeng said: Leading departments at all levels should 
study why this neighborhood enterprise can produce an output 
value of tens of million yuan with only several hundred workers, 
and why state-owned enterprises with several thousand workers 
can only produce an output value of several million yuan. This 
requires leaders at all levels not to keep their eyes only on 
large items. It is necessary to use the limited amount of funds 
in places where they are needed most. We must develop practical 
economic forms in line with the principle of making small 
investment but giving high yield and quick accumulation. We 
must prevent state-owned large enterprises from taking new 
burdens before changing the old mechanisms. Coal enterprises 
should free themselves from the shackle of the old production 
and management forms, broaden the train of thought, decontrol 
and invigorate business, develop diversified undertakings, and 
attain the goal of using sideline production to support the main 
business and small undertakings to support large ones. It is 
necessary to promote the principle of making all mines and 
mining units stand on their own feet and strive to turn all of 
them into a success. We should first support the well-developed 
enterprises before taking profits from them, draw profits from 
them properly, and must not drain the pond to get all the fish. 
  Yue Qifeng pointed out: The rate of changing the operational 
mechanisms of state-owned enterprises must now be quick. 
However, we must guard against the practice of formalism of 
putting on new shoes but retracing the beaten track and prevent 
the state-owned assets from being swallowed by the big common 
bowl. 
  He said: The most effective way to prevent the loss of 
state-owned assets is to turn them into state-owned people-run 
or people-owned and people-run enterprises. 
  Yue Qifeng stressed repeatedly: We must emancipate the mind 
in line with reality, and must not fear of negating ourselves. 
It is necessary to conscientiously investigate and find out the 
main reasons for restricting economic development. Only thus, 
can we strengthen the sense of crisis, urgency, and 
responsibility. 
  Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, and Wang Xianmin, secretary general of the provincial 
party committee, also participated in the investigation and 
study. Ma Guoliang also worked out plans for implementing the 
guideline of Yue Qifeng's speech.

  [Text] During his investigation and study in Jiamusi city, 
Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed 
out: In the process of building the system of socialist market 
economy, it is necessary to conscientiously study volume no.3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, further 
emancipate the mind, and reexamine the provincial and city 
situations with a new insight in an effort to form an economic 
development strategic thinking that complies with reality to 
promote a rapid economic development in the whole province. 
  On 10-11 June, Yue Qifeng conducted investigation and study 
in Jiamusi. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee, Wang Xianmin, member of the standing committee 
of the provincial party committee and secretary general, and 
responsible comrades of provincial departments concerned 
accompanied him during the inspection tour. Yue Qifeng and his 
entourage successively inspected Jiamusi paper mill, textile 
plant, synthetic materials plant, combined harvester 
manufacturing plant, Sanjiang Foodstuff Company Limited, and 
other state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; inspected 
the provincial state farms general administration, model 
villages in Jiamusi suburban areas, and village-run enterprises 
in (Sihe) Village; and visited (Liang Fengming), a major chicken 
raiser and deputy to the National People's Congress, and (Jiang 
Houzhi), an enterpreneur of a private enterprise. In every 
place the leading comrades traveled, they asked in detail about 
the production and operation of enterprises and the living of 
their workers, talked extensively with the broad masses of 
workers, and discussed with them major plans for economic 
development. During his inspection and study, Comrade Yue Qifeng 
offered some important views. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Since the third plenary session of the 11th 
party Central Committee, like other places in China, 
Heilongjiang Province has made big progress in economic 
construction. However, we must not deny that we have lagged 
behind the areas with rapid economic development. It is true 
that our lagging behind is caused by many objective reasons. But 
more importantly, I think it is caused by subjective reasons. 
For many years, we were used to practicing the unitary mode of 
planned economy, ownership structure, financial sources, and 
work thoughts, and had many deviations in our understanding of 
the provincial and city situations. At present, to march 
towards the goal of building the socialist market economic 
structure, we must further emancipate the mind, change ideas, 
reexamine the provincial and city situations, and establish an 
economic development strategic thinking that complies with the 
reality. 
  Yue Qifeng pointed out: Judging from the viewpoint of 
building a socialist theory with Chinese characteristics or from 
the actual situations of the past years, the old mechanisms left 
over during the past years are actually the mechanisms leading 
us to failure. This is why we must conduct reform. Reform is a 
painful process of thoroughly remolding ourselves, which 
includes casting aside some things we got familiar with in the 
past. For example, we concentrated our main energy for a long 
time on the production of raw materials which required big 
investments but gave small output, required strenuous efforts 
but earned small money, thus resulting in a very low economic 
efficiency. At present, we must actively readjust the 
industrial structure, develop precision and intensive processing 
industry, strive to increase the technological content and value 
of products, and raise economic efficiency. For another 
example, some comrades regarded township enterprises and 
individual and private economic units as an alien force of the 
socialist economy and discriminated against and suppressed them 
over a long period of time, thus making our province lag far 
behind the economically developed areas in this aspect. From 
this, we can see that we must use the socialist theory with 
Chinese characteristics to emancipate and arm our thinking. 
Only by so doing can we realistically broaden the reform pace 
in the course of our practical work. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Jiamusi city is a place of economic and 
strategic importance and vital communications outlet on the 
Sanjiang Plain. It is an important central city. How to 
accelerate its development and give full play to its radiating 
role is of vital importance to the whole province's economic 
construction. Therefore, Jiamusi city must proceed from its own 
reality and from the demands of developing the socialist market 
economy, conscientiously conduct investigation and study, and 
define its main targets and development priorities. Sanjiang 
Plain is China's important commodity grain base. We must exert 
strenuous efforts to study ways to process and convert grains as 
well as agricultural and sideline products into other products 
so as to increase their value, and enable Jiamusi city to 
gradually trun from an agricultural production base into a 
foodstuff industrial base so that its products can be sold in 
the whole country and can enter the world market. We should 
regard this as an important strategic orientation and objective 
and be determined to attain it. In this aspect, we should 
broaden our thinking, free our hands, invite business, and 
introduce capital. In addition to keeping our eyes on overseas 
businessmen, we should also regard southeast coastal 
economically developed areas as our cooperation partners, 
combine our resources and industrial advantages with their 
funds, technology and market advantages, and seek development 
through cooperation. 
  After hearing work briefings given by leading comrades of 
the 
provincial state farms general administration, Yue Qifeng 
pointed out: Actually, we are conducting the second development 
program in the Great Northern Wilderness. Comparing with the 
first development, the second development has much better 
conditions. But the tasks are more arduous and the objectives 
are more magnificent. It is not enough to change the Great 
Northern Wilderness into a big granary of northeast China. We 
should learn from, inherit, and promote the spirit of the people 
in the Great Northern Wilderness, hold aloft the banner of 
building an enterprise through arduous efforts, and build this 
place into China's commodity grain base and foodstuffs 
industrial base.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The trial of three men 
accused of the murder of 32 people in the March 31 Qiandao Lake 
tragedy opened here today in public in the Intermediate People's 
Court of Hangzhou city in east China's Zhejiang Province. 
  Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun are accused of robbery and 
murder in the boat-fire tragedy which claimed the lives of 24 
Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, a 
major tourist attraction in Hangzhou city. 
  A deputy chief procurator from the Hangzhou People's 
Procuratorate opened the proceedings against the three accused. 
  He told the court that the three accused seized large 
quantities of other people's property by threatening them with 
violence and then murdered their victims by blowing up the boat 
and setting fire to it to cover up the crime. 
  The indictment said that the acts of the accused were in 
violation of article 150 and article 132 of the criminal law of 
the People's Republic of China. 
  The indictment described the case as very serious and very 
harmful to society. 
  It said that there was enough evidence to prove the criminal 
acts of the accused. The three accused committed the crimes 
jointly and the sentence should be for all the crimes combined. 
  The court was composed of one presiding judge and two other 
judges. The case for the prosecution is being put by three 
public prosecutors, and the accused have lawyers to defend for 
them. 
  The public hearing, under the regulations of China's 
criminal 
procedural law, will consist of a court investigation, court 
arguments, final pleadings of the accused, court verdict, 
followed by sentence. 
  Court decisions will be reached after thorough investigation 
and verification to make sure that the accused have been proved 
to be the perpetrators of the crimes. 
  The court must also decide the nature and seriousness of the 
crime and what the appropriate punishment should be. 
  The 200-seat court was crowded with members of the public 
this morning, including local residents, relatives of the 
victims, Taiwan businessmen and representatives of a Taiwan 
travel agency. 
  About 60 reporters from China's mainland, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan followed the entire hearing via a special closed-circuit 
TV in a room set aside for this in the court building.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Three men accused of 
robbery and murder in the March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy were 
sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life 
here today. 
  The judgment of first instance was made earlier today by the 
intermediate people's court of Hangzhou city in east China's 
Zhejiang Province. 
  The court ruled that the facts of the crimes were clear and 
the evidence was complete. 
  The court verdict, read out by Yang Gang, president of the 
intermediate people's court of Hangzhou city, said that Wu 
Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun had committed robbery and murder 
in the boat-fire tragedy, which claimed the lives of 24 Taiwan 
tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, a major 
tourist attraction in Zhejiang Province. 
  It said that the three men seized large quantities of the 
tourists' property by threatening them with violence and then 
murdered the victims by blowing up the boat and setting fire to 
it to cover up the crime, and the punishment was for both 
robbery and murder. 
  The court turned down the defence lawyers' appeal for 
lenient 
punishment, because the crimes were very serious, cruel and 
caused great harm to the society. 
  The court also ordered that the robbed goods and money be 
returned to relatives of the victims, and the motor boat used by 
the criminals be confiscated and turned over to the state. 
  According to law, the three accused can appeal, either 
through the intermediate court of Hangzhou city or directly, to 
the higher people's court of Zhejiang Province within three days 
after they received the verdicts, which had already been handed 
to them today. 
  More than 200 people were present to hear the judgment at 
the 
court today, including local residents, relatives of victims 
from the mainland, and representatives of the Soaring Travel 
Service of Taiwan.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 11 (XINHUA) -- A procurator today 
asked the court to severely punish, according to law, the three 
men accused of the murder of 32 people in the March 31 Qiandao 
Lake tragedy. 
  Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun are accused of robbery and 
murder in the boat-fire tragedy which claimed the lives of 24 
Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, in 
east China's Zhejiang Province. 
  On the second day of their trial before the Hangzhou City 
Intermediate Court today, the procurator from the Hangzhou City 
People's Procuratorate repeated that the three accused jointly 
committed a crime "very serious and harmful" to society. 
  In their own defence, the three accused men all confessed 
their guilt, but expressed repentance for committing such a 
heinous crime. 
  Wu Lihong said: "I committed the crime for the sake of 
money. Now, all I can do is to say sorry to the victims and 
their families." 
  The accused men's three defence lawyers did not raise 
objections to the facts or nature of the crimes committed, but 
expressed the hope that the court would punish the defendants 
leniently because they had all three confessed their guilt and 
had shown repentance. 
  The intermediate court announced that it would pronounce its 
judgment on the case tomorrow morning.

<F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- A Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) official on Saturday [11 June] said the trial 
of the three suspects charged with robbing and murdering 24 
Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crewmen and guides aboard a 
pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake was like a "play acted according 
to a prepared script." 
  Hsu Hui-you, SEF's vice secretary-general, said that he 
regretted that the trial, which ended with final prosecution and 
defense statements on Saturday, was seriously flawed, and that 
it only revealed Beijing's intention to summarily close the 
case. He said that the complexity of the case meant it should 
have been handled in a careful and thorough manner. 
  The court will announce the verdict Sunday. 
  Hsu said that key witnesses to the crime were not allowed to 
testify, and that many of the questions raised by Taiwan 
concerning the case remained unanswered. 
  The prosecutor asked the court to mete out the death penalty 
to the three men because of the heinousness of their crime. The 
defendants' lawyers asked for leniency, saying their clients had 
shown deep regret for their crimes. The defendants, Wu Lihong, 
Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun, all pleaded guilty, and did not defend 
themselves when testifying. Yu did say, however, that he hoped 
cross-strait relations would improve after sentencing is carried 
out on him and the other two defendants. 
  Hsu was not as optimistic that the cross-strait relationship 
would resume as it had been before the incident, saying that 
scars would be left on the hearts of Taiwanese because of the 
way Beijing handled the case.

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan's government and 
private sectors are gradually reaching a consensus on slowing 
down contacts with Mainland China, Hsu Hui-you, deputy 
secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said 
Monday [13 June]. 
  Hsu said that the change in mainland policy is inevitable in 
light of the Qiandao Lake incident, which has once again exposed 
the nature of the Beijing regime and their ideas about 
cross-Taiwan Strait relations. 
  Hsu, a career attorney, said the recent trial of three 
suspects involved in the Qiandao Lake murders was so speedy and 
so simple that the whole process was not only "coarse" but also 
"immoral." 
  Taiwan was denied a say in the trial, hsu said, adding that 
the case early on turned from the criminal to political and 
needed a political solution. 
  Hsu said Taiwan residents have been too hasty to develop 
close ties with the mainland since the 40-year ban on 
cross-strait contacts was lifted. The hastiness is 
understandable, he said, as the Taiwan people could not help 
themselves in the face of eager calls from the "homeland," and 
seemingly unlimited business opportunities, he said. 
  Stricken with "mainland fever," Hsu said, Taiwan residents 
forgot to remind themselves of the huge difference between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait and the fact that Beijing has 
never renounced its threat to take Taiwan by force.

  [Text] After the news on the Hangchou [Hangzhou] City 
Intermediate People's Court in Communist China's Chekiang 
[Zhejiang] Province announcing the death sentence for the three 
accused in the Chientao [Qinqdao] Lake murder case was reported 
in Taiwan, families of some victims expressed their utter 
refusal to recognize the verdict before the whole truth came 
out. They said they would try to request a meeting with 
President Li and Premier Lien Chan in the next few days to 
appeal to the government for a clear and definite answer to the 
proper handling of the case. The following is a report filed by 
(Huang Mei-ting): 
  [Begin recording] [(Huang]) After Communist China's Hangchou 
City Intermediate People's Court announced the death sentence 
for the three accused in the Chientao Lake incident, family 
members of some victims said that though the verdict was no 
surprise to them, the death sentence for the three could not 
replace the life of the 24 victims from Taiwan. Meanwhile, as 
the trial was conducted not in public and without the presence 
of the families of the victims, they have refused to recognize 
whatsoever the verdict before the whole truth comes out, even 
though the accused have been sentenced to die. 
  [Unidentified voice] The trial was conducted without the 
presence of the bereaved families. What has angered us most is 
that the trial was not open. Therefore, despite the death 
sentence, we cannot recognize the verdict. 
  [(Huang)] As far as compensation is concerned, the bereaved 
families regard it as secondary because they believe that the 
way Communist China handles the case can absolutely not satisfy 
the demand of the families in dire financial need. They 
indicate that should the government fail to make a demand on 
Communist China, the families can only pressure the government 
for a proper settlement. Therefore, the victims' families will 
(?meet with) Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan this 
Wednesday [15 June] to study the possibility of requesting a 
meeting with President Li and Premier Lien Chan, and will then 
decide the next move. We think of our dear ones on festive 
occasions more than ever. To the families of the 20-odd victims 
of the Chientao Lake incident, this year's Dragon Boat Festival 
will be a sad occasion. They said what they want to know is 
just the truth. But judging from the current situation, 
Communist China is persistently trying to cover up the facts. 
The truth will probably never come out. [end recording]

  [Text] Having been affected by the Chientao [Qiandao] Lake 
incident, the follow-up consultations between the private 
intermediary organs of Taiwan and the mainland and high-level 
talks between the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF) and the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS) have 
been postponed. However, to demonstrate the basic stand of 
fulfilling relevant agreements and to hold consultations as soon 
as possible to resolve various issues arising from exchanges 
between the two sides of the strait, senior officials of the SEF 
and the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] recently decided that 
following the holding of a mainland affairs work conference in 
July and after coordinating the resumption of the follow-up 
working-level consultations, the SEF would be authorized to 
invite the mainland's Tang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei], executive vice 
chairman of the ARATS, to visit Taiwan for the second round of 
the Chiao [Jen-ho]-Tang talks. 
  As for the specific date for the second round of the 
Chiao-Tang talks, Kao Kung-lien, spokesman for and vice chairman 
of the MAC, and Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary 
general of the SEF, said recently in separate statements that 
the second Chiao-Tang talks could take place in August. 
  There is great concern, however, on whether the MAC will 
still persist in adopting a set of interlocking stratagems in 
authorizing the SEF to invite Tang Shu-pei to Taiwan for the 
second round of Chiao-Tang talks according to the relevant 
stipulations. In particular, the success or failure of the 
upcoming talks and whether the two sides can establish a common 
understanding will directly affect the plan for whether the 
second round of the Ku-Wang [Ku Chen-fu-Wang Daohan] talks can 
take place this year.

  [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
Premier Lien Chan returned to Taipei early Saturday [11 June] 
morning after a four-country tour, which took him to El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and the United States. 
  Lien, accompanied by his wife and several government 
officials, arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at 
5:47 A.M., 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The Liens soon left 
the airport for home. 
  The advance arrival allowed Lien to avoid an encounter with 
a 
group of opposition legislators who arrived at the airport 
around 6 A.M. to protest Lien's alleged illegal instructions to 
state-run companies to offer ruling Kuomintang [KMT] lawmakers 
easier access to bidding for their construction projects. 
  Failing to meet Lien, the Democratic Progressive Party 
lawmakers, headed by Yen Chin-fu, said they will launch a series 
of demonstrations around the island to push the government to 
stop the practice of taking "kickbacks" among the ruling party, 
state-run firms and KMT lawmakers. 
  Many ranking officials, including Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu, greeted Lien at the airport. 
  During an in-flight news conference on his way from New York 
to Taipei, Lien said his three-country Central American tour 
will help strengthen the Republic of China's relations with that 
region. 
  "I'm happy as I have accomplished my mission as expected," 
Lien told reporters who had covered his official visits to El 
Salvador and Guatemala. 
  Lien said his three-day unofficial visit to Mexico was very 
fruitful. While there, Lien met with many Mexican political and 
business heavyweights for wide-ranging talks. 
  Lien would not reveal with which Mexican officials he had 
talked. He instead said he had managed to meet with whomever he 
planned to see. 
  Lien was the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico 
since the two countries severed diplomatic ties 23 years ago. 
  Lien said he is optimistic about future Taiwan-Mexico ties, 
particularly in the economic and cultural fields. "Mexican 
authorities have shown keen interest in promoting commercial, 
tourist and cultural exchanges with Taiwan," he said. 
  Taiwan will benefit from boosting cooperation with Mexico as 
Mexico has signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with 
the United States and Canada and has maintained close relations 
with Caribbean and Central American nations, Lien said.

<F P=106> [By Queenie Wang and Ron Gluckman] </F>
  [Text] A top Chinese official angrily denounced Executive 
Councillor Professor Edward Chen Kwan-yiu yesterday, saying he 
talked "nonsense" when claiming it was better for Hong Kong if 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died "earlier rather than later". 
XINHUA (NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) deputy director, Zhang Junsheng, 
said he was furious about remarks made by Professor Chen during 
a visit to Japan last week. "It's nonsense for Mr Chen, as an 
Executive Councillor, to make such frivolous remarks about a man 
who is highly respected by people all over the world," Mr Zhang 
said. "Personally, I am really quite angry. Mr Deng's health is 
very good. But, regardless of that, I do not think Mr Chen 
should make such remarks about a respectable old man." 
  Professor Chen was supposed to have told foreign 
correspondents in Tokyo: "From the point of view of Hong Kong 
people, it's better for Deng to go earlier than later." But 
yesterday he refused to apologise, insisting he had been 
misquoted, and that even a child should have understood what he 
meant. "I never said that Deng should die," he said while 
attending the opening of a Consumer Council exhibition in 
Pacific Place. "I wasn't wishing for Deng Xiaoping's death, 
only an end to the uncertainty. There are clearly only three 
options: he will either pass away before 1997, during 1997, or 
after 1997. I merely pointed out that the timing is critical to 
Hong Kong. What I said was in no way remarkable. It's only 
common sense. A child would have understood it." 
  He railed at the local media for "blowing out of proportion" 
one minor comment from a 45-minute luncheon address to the 
Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo. He said he had been 
explaining how Hong Kong suffered from uncertainty generated by 
worries over Mr Deng's deteriorating health and speculation 
about his successor. 
  On Friday, the latest rumours concerning the death of Mr 
Deng 
sent the Hang Seng Index into a 263-point dive. 
  "I'm not happy about the way it was reported and I'm not 
apologising," he said. "I don't mind if they report what I 
said, because I made wonderful speech about China and its future 
direction. But they take this one thing and report it out of 
context." 
  Professor Chen also accused local press and academics of 
self-censorship. "There is so much self-censorship, among the 
media and the academic community," he said. "That's what's sad. 
It's not coming from Beijing, but here. We're beginning to 
think 10 times before we say something, about what the reaction 
might be in Beijing. We compromise ourselves." 
  Mr Zhang said it was unlikely China would file a formal 
complaint with the Hong Kong Government.

<F P=106> [By Neville de Silva, Diplomatic Editor] </F>
  [Text] Fears are mounting among Hong Kong-based diplomats 
that China may plant spies and informers in consulates by 
imposing new recruitment rules for local staff after 1997. 
These fears stem from indications that China will introduce a 
Foreign Ministry-run government agency which will supply all 
local staff to foreign diplomatic missions in Hong Kong, a 
practice which now operates in China. Some consulates have 
already been examining ways to tighten up security, including 
the access of local staff to sensitive information. 
  Concerns were heightened following comments earlier this 
month by Zhang Junsheng, a deputy director of the local branch 
of China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. Mr Zhang told German 
journalist Peter Seidlitz that China would establish a foreign 
affairs office in Hong Kong which would be in charge of all 
major affairs. "All issues of foreign affairs in Hong Kong will 
be unified and dealt with under the management of the central 
government in Beijing," he was reported as saying. He did not 
spell out the issue of local staff recruitment. 
  The local branch of XINHUA refused to comment when THE 
HONGKONG STANDARD asked about central recruitment being extended 
to Hong Kong. 
  If it happens, Hong Kong-based consulates would no longer be 
able to recruit their own staff but would have to apply to the 
Chinese office to fill their staff needs. Some countries are 
expected to voice their disapproval if China decides to extend 
the practice here. 
  Hong Kong staff working at various diplomatic missions are 
also worried about their future after 1997. Some have already 
voiced their concerns to their employers. Some fear for their 
jobs while others believe they may be forced to provide 
information. 
  The central recruitment system, followed by most communist 
countries, allows the host nation to infiltrate "suspect" 
diplomatic missions and plant bugs, spies and informers inside 
foreign consulates and diplomatic households. Diplomats who 
have served in the former Soviet Union and communist capitals in 
eastern Europe told THE HONGKONG STANDARD they had to be alert 
because they did not know whether local staff were genuine 
employees or intelligence personnel working as clerks, 
interpreters, drivers, and even cleaners. "It was always a 
strained relationship for one didn't know who one could trust," 
a diplomat, who had served in the former Soviet bloc, said. 
  Several diplomats said that if Beijing introduced the 
central 
recruitment system here, the same strained relationship that 
prevailed in China would come to Hong Kong too. "This would be 
a very unfavourable development. We would have to keep local 
staff at arms' length as happened in other communist capitals," 
a senior Western diplomat said. Other diplomats said it was 
unlikely China would create an unnecessary problem by extending 
the practice to Hong Kong. 
  But diplomats who were concerned about central recruitment 
argued that after 1997 some of the diplomatic missions would 
assume greater importance. "Naturally Beijing would like to 
know what we are up to, particularly since Hong Kong has a 
democracy movement which is seen as subversive. These are 
matters we would have to report on and Beijing would like to 
know what we have to report back home." 
  The British-Hong Kong governments prefer not to raise the 
issue in the hope that Beijing will not give it any thought.

<F P=106> [Report: "Wang Rudeng Says There Still Will Be Press </F>
Freedom in Hong Kong After 1997"] 
  [Text] Wang Rudeng, assistant director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, emphasized yesterday that the Chinese Government 
would ensure that Hong Kong enjoyed freedom of the press and 
freedom of speech after 1997. He did not think that Hong Kong's 
mass media organizations would exercise self-restraint or press 
censorship for fear of offending the Chinese side, but he 
reaffirmed that while enjoying press freedom, we should be 
particular about the objectiveness and truthfulness of the press 
and speeches, and that journalists should be abide by the law. 
  Wang Rudeng discussed press freedom after attending a 
ceremony to present prizes at a dragon boat invitation 
tournament held by the Central and Western District yesterday. 
He emphasized that in the past, the Chinese Government and the 
XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have always greatly respected freedom of 
the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong. He also believed 
that after 1997, the Chinese side would try its best to ensure 
local freedom of the press and of speech. He pointed out, 
however, that while enjoying freedom of the press, we should be 
particular about the objectiveness and truthfulness of the press 
and speeches. He said that while enjoying freedom of the press, 
we should not distort facts at will and make groundless 
accusations, nor should we publish biased speeches. He held 
that journalists should be abide by the law, and that if they 
violate the law, they should be punished according to the law. 
  When asked about the incident that occurred in the News 
Department of Asia Television Limited [ATV] not long ago 
[reference to resignation of several ATV journalists in light of 
TV station's decision not to air a Spanish TV documentary on 
Tiananmen -- a decision later rescinded], Wang Rudeng said that 
it was purely an issue of the ATV administration itself and did 
not concern freedom of the press. He also said that he did not 
think the mass media organizations in Hong Kong would exercise 
self-restraint or censorship for fear of offending the Chinese 
side because everyone could see the respect of the Chinese 
Government and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch for local press 
freedom. He also emphasized that there would not be any problem 
for the media to criticize the Chinese side after 1997. 
  On the other hand, Wang Rudeng criticized as groundless and 
irresponsible Legislative Councillor Emily Lau's accusation at 
the "City Forum" last month that he had intervened in press 
freedom. He pointed out that at the City Forum last month, 
Emily Lau accused him of inviting persons in charge of some mass 
media organizations to a meeting a few years ago, and of asking 
them to intervene in the news coverage carried out by their 
subordinates. In that year, Emily Lau made a telephone call to 
him to ask about the matter and to make the accusation, but she 
was not able to provide strong and concrete evidence, such as 
with whom he met, or when and where, or what issues he discussed 
that constituted an intervention in press freedom. He held that 
Emily Lau was irresponsible to have brought up this matter again 
on a public occasion and to have made a groundless accusation 
against him.

  [Text] The assistant director of the Hong Kong branch of 
China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Wang Rudeng, yesterday 
assured Hong Kong journalists that they would still enjoy press 
freedom after 1997. "The Chinese government and the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY respect press freedom in Hong Kong," he said. "The 
problem of offending the Chinese government has never emerged." 
  Speaking to journalists after the opening of the Dragon Boat 
Festival, Mr Wang said the Chinese government had often assured 
Hong Kong that it would enjoy press freedom after 1997. "Even 
if the news criticises the Chinese government, it is all right." 
  But he said press freedom did not mean that journalists 
could 
fabricate reports. Commenting on the case of Xi Yang, the Ming 
Pao journalist who was sentenced to 12 years jail in Beijing in 
April, he said every journalist had to abide by the law. "If 
anyone, including journalists, offends the law, he will be 
punished," Mr Wang said. 
  He also said the recent dispute between the ATV management 
and the editorial office was an internal ATV matter. "It is not 
related to press freedom," he said.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Revision to `Unfair' Law Against Dumping </F>
Urged"] 
  [Text] A senior Chinese trade expert urges the United 
States to revise its unfair anti-dumping law, which he claims 
has unjustifiably cost China several hundred million dollars 
worth of exports. 
  The U.S., viewing China as a special case because of its 
transition from a planned to a market-based economy, agreed in 
1988 to revise its law. 
  The 1988 Comprehensive Trade Law stipulated that the U.S. 
Department of Commerce complete studies on China's 
market-oriented economic reform and possible revision of 
America's anti-dumping law against China by August 23, 1989. 
The U.S. was to send specialists to China to examine production 
costs and export prices. 
  However, the whole process was halted after June 4, 1989. 
  "Now time is up for the two countries to restore contacts on 
the issue," said Zhou Shijian deputy director of the Institute 
of International Trade Research at the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC). 
  But Zhou believes the U.S. is unlikely to make its 
anti-dumping law against China totally reasonable in the near 
future, given America's concerns over its foreign trade balance 
and the waxing and waning of domestic trade-protectionist 
sentiments. 
  "Western nations usually espouse protectionism under the 
veneer of protecting fair competition, and the U.S. anti-dumping 
law against China is unreasonable and unfair, too," Zhou said. 
  He said exporters from a market-economy country would not be 
charged with dumping on the American market so long as their 
prices are above domestic levels, but the U.S. won't apply the 
same yardstick to China. Chinese exporters are given no 
standard price level under which they could face dumping charges. 
  Zhou said, "How can people abide by a law which is 
unpredictable?" 
  Zhou attributes the lower prices of Chinese exports mainly 
to 
cheaper labour and lower-quality products. 
  "In disregard of this fact, the U.S. usually makes a 
comparison between Chinese products and their peers from 
developed countries, where costs are much higher," he points out. 
  Thus, Zhou said, the results of the comparison can only be 
unfair: Low-priced Chinese products are judged to have been 
dumped. What is ridiculous, Zhou said, is that Indian exports to 
the U.S., which are comparable in price to China's, are not 
regarded as dumping items simply because the U.S. views India as 
a market economy and China as a planned one. 
  "China no longer has a centrally planned economy," Zhou 
pointed out. "Foreign-invested enterprises, private business 
and township ventures have all sprouted over the past decade.

(0719 4539 2009)] 
  [Text] Suzhou, 11 Jun (XINHUA) -- The national conference 
on the comprehensive management work on public security in rural 
areas closed in Wujiang city, Jiangsu Province, today. 
  Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and 
member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, pointed 
out in his speech to the meeting: At present and for a period 
to come, we should focus efforts on the development of rural 
productive forces and should strive to attain the objective of 
making rural areas fairly well-off. While deepening reforms and 
developing the economy, we should strengthen democracy and the 
legal system in rural areas, bring into full play the role of 
grass-roots organizations, let every family share in the 
comprehensive efforts to improve law and order in rural areas, 
and gradually turn those areas into a new, prosperous, 
democratic, civilized, and modern socialist countryside. 
  Wen Jiabao said: China is a big agricultural country with 
the great majority of its population in rural areas. The state 
of rural public security will have an impact not only on the 
reform, development, and stability of the rural areas but also 
on the reform, development, and stability of the whole country. 
He said: Doing a good job in the comprehensive management of 
public security in rural areas is important to keeping to the 
socialist orientation and to upholding the people's democratic 
dictatorship in rural areas. It is also an important condition 
to enable us to concentrate on rural reform and rural 
modernization. 
  Wen Jiabao emphasized: To fundamentally solve the rural 
public security problem, we must pay great attention to economic 
construction -- the central task -- and accelerate rural 
economic development. At the same time, we must mobilize and 
organize the strength of the entire society, and use various 
means and make comprehensive efforts to deal with the problem. 
Only in this way can we fundamentally prevent and reduce crimes 
and maintain law and order in rural areas. 
  Wen Jiabao pointed out: We should basically rely on 
democracy and the legal system to ensure a good comprehensive 
management of rural public security and to maintain rural 
stability. In particular, we should know how to solve problems 
using the law and using education. For this reason, we should 
pay great attention to educating the broad masses of the 
peasants in a socialist democratic and legal system. We should 
spread legal knowledge, enhance the peasants' awareness of the 
legal system, make them understand the law, and arm them with a 
legal weapon. We should mobilize the masses to formulate 
village rules and regulations, govern villages according to the 
law, and promote democratic village administration. 

    Wen Jiabao said that the key to doing a good job in the 
comprehensive management of public security in rural areas lies 
in enhancing party leadership and in energetically implementing 
various measures on the comprehensive management of public 
security. He called for giving full play to the roles of 
grass-roots party branches as a leadership core and as a 
fighting bastion. Only with strong and effective party branches 
can we expect to forcefully implement the party's basic line and 
the party's policies for rural areas, to educate and guide the 
farmers to follow discipline and to abide by laws, to 
voluntarily help maintain social order, to fight criminal 
elements, to genuinely implement comprehensive management 
measures down to every household, and to bring about social 
stability in rural areas. 
  Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
and chairman of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive 
Management of Public Security, delivered a summary of the 
meeting. In the present struggle to comprehensively improve 
public security in rural areas, he called for developing the 
excellent tradition of integrating the specialized organs' work 
with the mass line. He also called for the constant creation of 
new experiences, and for relying on and mobilizing the masses to 
enrich and develop new ingredients for the comprehensive 
management of public security work, so that they will play an 
even bigger role in helping maintain public security in urban 
and rural areas. He also spoke of the need to promote the 
implementation of the leadership responsibility system as well 
as the personal responsibility system in the comprehensive 
management of public security through the present drive to 
manage public security in rural areas; and to guarantee the 
smooth progress of the present struggle through the 
implementation of the leadership responsibility system and the 
personal responsibility system in the comprehensive management 
of public security. 
  Luo Gan, state councillor and vice chairman of the Central 
Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security; 
and Zhang Siqing, vice chairman of the Central Committee for the 
Comprehensive Management of Public Security and procurator 
general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, attended today's 
meeting.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Ma Ling (7456 3781): "Li Ruihuan </F>
and Zhang Baifa -- Striking Similarities"] 
  [Text] The relationship between Zhang Baifa and Li Ruihuan 
was once the talk of the town. Some even acclaimed at their 
"predestined" relationship. 
  Zhang and Li had many similarities and some sounded a bit 
unimaginable. Both of them were born in the same year in 
peasant families in Xianghe County, Hebei. Zhang was only three 
months older than Li. They entered the Beijing No. 3 
Construction Company as apprentices in the same year. Li 
Ruihuan learned carpentry, while Zhang Baifa was a trainee in 
reinforced bar. Although they had not attended institutions of 
higher learning, both of them tackled major technological 
problems in the general technical competition. Li Ruihuan 
resolved the technical problem of enlargement, while Zhang Baifa 
resolved the problem of leaping over steel framework. Later, 
both organized shock brigades and became labor models. They 
also were promoted on the same day. They were interviewed by 
the same person, who talked about the same position. The only 
difference is that the position of assistant general manager was 
for different companies. 
  It is even more strange that: Their wives, who had the same 
name, were born on the same day and same month. Zhang Baifa 
said realistically: "As we were construction workers during 
those years, it was difficult to get girlfriends. Moreover, 
girls in the urban areas were not willing to marry construction 
workers. Some people even said ironically: You look like 
beggars at a distance, or construction workers closer up. For 
this reason, our wives all were from rural areas." 
Unexpectedly, they got wives from rural areas with such 
similarities. 
  Now their grandchildren have the same names and are of the 
same ages. In addition, they go to the same schools. None of 
this was intentionally prearranged. 
  It seems that the "predestined relationship" between Li 
Ruihuan and Zhang Baifa cannot be explained by common sense. 
  While talking about Li Ruihuan, however, Zhang Baifa could 
not help expressing his appreciation from the botton of his 
heart: "Li Ruihuan is very clever. Willing to learn and to 
summarize work, Li is always more impressive than others when 
speaking: No one remains unconvinced before him. In terms of 
learning, I am not his match. When he gives a lecture on 
philosophy at a university, the students are never sleepy. He 
is an eloquent speaker with a good memory. He is knowledgeable 
and argues well on almost any topic. I hold him in special 
regard. I like to joke casually with other people, but never 
with him."

  [Text] Washington, June 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said Thursday [9 June] that the 
United States remains committed to backing China's efforts for 
re-entry into GATT and membership of the World Trade 
Organization. 
  In a meeting here with Long Yongtu, China's assistant 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, Kantor 
mentioned what he called "a courageous decision" President 
Clinton announced two weeks ago to extend China's 
most-favored-nation trade status without conditions. He 
described it as an extremely important step for promoting 
U.S.-China relations. 
  He said that the two great countries of the United States 
and 
China should establish a relationship of cooperation with mutual 
confidence between them. While giving assurance of Washington's 
continued support for China's effort to resume its seat as a 
founding member of GATT and become a member of the World Trade 
Organization, Kantor indicated that China should, like all other 
countries, assume the responsibilities as the multilateral trade 
system requires. 
  The Chinese assistant minister said that basing itself on 
the 
principle of balance between rights and duties, China has shown 
and will continue to show the greatest possible flexibility in 
the talks on its re-entry into GATT. But he made it clear that 
there is a limit to such flexibility, i.e., the obligations 
China is expected to undertake have to be suited to the present 
level of China's economic development and full consideration 
must be given to the fact that China's economic reform and the 
establishment of a market economy are a process of gradual 
advance. 
  Long Yongtu led a 24-member Chinese delegation to the ninth 
round of Sino-U.S. bilateral consultations on China's re-entry 
into GATT, which were held here on June 5-8. The U.S. 
delegation in the 4-day talks was composed of 45 people from 
various government departments. A Chinese official said that 
both sides regarded this round of talks as frank and sincere, 
which resulted in positive progress. 
  According to the Chinese official, considerable differences 
still exist between China and the United States on a number of 
issues, especially on the issue as regards the U.S. demand for 
China to open its market in the service sector. The two sides 
agreed to continue their consultations in Geneva at the end of 
this month.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jian (6392 0256): "Wang Hanbin Believes </F>
There is Great Potential for Economic Cooperation and Trade 
Between China and the United States"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wang Hanbin, 
vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, told a visiting 
delegation comprising famous U.S.-based Chinese entrepreneurs in 
a meeting that there is great potential for economic cooperation 
and trade between China and the U.S. and that much can be 
accomplished by overseas Chinese residing in the States in 
promoting Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Wang gave his guests a detailed account of China's economic 
development over the last few years, especially the reforms with 
respect to the fiscal and taxation system, foreign exchange, 
foreign trade, and prices. He said China has put into effect 
more reform measures than ever this year, adding that facts show 
the situation regarding economic operations has been good. If 
these reform measures prove finally successful, this will mean 
that China has taken a decisive step forward toward the 
socialist market economy, he added. 
  Wang said: China will continue to develop steadily and open 
wider to the outside world. With the economic development, 
China has great market potential. Many big companies in the 
world, including quite a few U.S. companies, are interested in 
exploring the China market, while China is also in great need of 
U.S. funds and technology. The two sides can intensify 
cooperation to their mutual benefit. 
  Wang emphasized: China and the United States have a common 
duty to safeguard world peace, including peace in the 
Asia-Pacific region, and this is in their common interest. 
Improved Sino-U.S. relations will be beneficial to both 
countries and to peace and development in the world, including 
the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Wang said the large numbers of Overseas Chinese constitute a 
valuable opportunity for China's development. He hopes Overseas 
Chinese and Chinese-Americans in the United States will 
contribute to promoting Sino-U.S. relations, help China to 
develop into a prosperous and powerful country, and help develop 
the U.S. economy. 
  The visiting delegation comprised seven members: Chen 
Hsien-chang, senior adviser to the Illinois Springfield [chun 
tian 2504 3944] City CTI Scientific and Technological Advisory 
Company; Chen Sulian, chairwoman of the board of the In Flight 
[fei xiang 7378 5046] Airline Food Company Limited and her 
assistant; Liao Tzu-kuang, chairman of the board of the Liao 
Tzu-kuang Investment Group; Yao Chien-min, chairman of the board 
of the Asian Integrated Industrial Company Limited; Yao-Chin 
Yi-li, president of the Hawaii Pioneer Deposit Bank; and Li 
Ching-tao, president of the Billion Asian International Company 
Limited. They are visiting China at the invitation of the NPC 
Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. After concluding their 
visit to Beijing, they will visit Shanghai and other places. 
While in China, they will hold talks with departments concerned 
over major investment projects. 
  Also present at the meeting were Yang Taifang, chairman of 
the NPC Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and Lin Liyin, vice 
chairwoman.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhang Zhenguo (1728 2182 0948) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Chen Baoshan (7115 1405 0810)] 
  [Text] Hefei, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- In spite of the rain, Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua visited the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company 
from 8 to 9 June. During his visit, he inspected the 
2,500-cubic-meter blast furnace system project, including a 
wharf, a warehouse, a sintering plant, and a disk mill, which 
was recently put into operation. He warmly praised the 
hard-working spirit displayed by the company's workers and staff 
members who have increased the company's annual production 
capacity from 2 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes. 
  Zou Jiahua also attended and spoke at a ceremony marking the 
full operation of the blast furnace system project. 
  After his inspection, Jou Jiahua held an on-the-spot meeting 
at the company. He listened carefully to the briefings 
presented by all section chiefs of the company. He also asked 
them about their experiences in running large and medium 
enterprises. He said: As a large enterprise, the Maanshan Iron 
and Steel Company has invigorated itself by seizing 
opportunities, deepening reform, and changing the management 
mechanism. Under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial CPC 
Committee and Government, the company has achieved great results 
in its work because its leading group is united and its workers 
are capable. He expressed his hope that the company will 
achieve greater results on the basis of its current achievements. 
  Jou Jiahua said: In carrying out the economic work, it is 
necessary to keep the general goal in sight and to take the 
daily tasks in hand. We should carry out our work step by step. 
The steel industry is an important basic industry. Besides 
building some more new steel plants, we should focus on 
renovating existing steel enterprises because this is the best 
way to achieve quick results with less money. The most 
important way to run state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises is to become market-oriented, develop new products, 
adopt new technologies, guarantee quality, reduce costs, and 
enhance economic performance. He also urged all enterprises to 
continue to pay attention to spiritual civilization construction. 
  Secretary Lu Rongjing and Governor Fu Xishou of Anhui 
Province accompanied Jou Jiahua during his inspection. Other 
people who accompanied Jou Jiahua were major leading cadres 
including Ye Qing, vice minister of the State Planning 
Commission; Liu Qi, minister of the metallurgical industry; Chen 
Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission; Tu Yourui, vice president of the State Development 
Bank; Li Zaohang, vice president of the Construction Bank; Wu 
Naiwen, deputy director of the General Administration of 
Customs; and Lu Renfa, deputy director of the State General 
Administration of Taxation.

  [Text] Unemployment on the mainland is rising as more 
factory workers and government cadres are being laid off with 
China's economy switching from its cradle-to-grave socialist 
structure to a competitive market framework, a senior government 
official says. Vice-Minister of Labour, Zhu Jiazhen, said 
recently that the Government was facing increasing pressure to 
find work for workers displaced because of the restructure of 
the industrial sector. 
  Although China has claimed impressive economic growth this 
year, many state enterprises faced a serious shortage of working 
capital and some even had difficulty paying their workers after 
the Government ordered the state-owned banks to restrict credit 
as part of its anti-inflation policy. 
  In addition to finding employment for the displaced workers, 
Mr Zhu said the Government was also under great stress to speed 
up the establishment of a national insurance scheme to act as a 
"safety net" for the unemployed. He said the top leadership 
feared that the country could become unstable if unemployment 
was not brought under control soon. While the Government would 
try to create as many jobs as possible in a bid to make inroads 
into unemployment, the authorities also hoped that more 
displaced workers would be able to find work in the burgeoning 
servicing industry. 
  He also admitted that China faced the problem of "hidden 
unemployment" as Chinese enterprises abandoned their old 
socialist management systems. Workers displaced by these 
enterprises were often kept on the enterprises' payrolls but 
they only received part of their usual salaries and were not 
officially classified as "unemployed".

<F P=106> [Report by John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The biggest economic debate now facing China's 
policymakers is over the performance of state-run enterprises 
and this dispute needs to be addressed at the next plenum of the 
Communist Party Central Committee, according to a senior 
official. "There is a dispute on the understanding of the 
overall performance of state-run enterprises," said a State 
Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems official. 
  A consensus on the question was important because it would 
help determine the urgency with which the government proceeded 
with trying to overhaul the most lethargic economic sector. The 
official said that by some measures, the situation looked grim. 
Under new accounting procedures nearly half the state-owned 
sector was in the red. Yet, by other statistics, state-run 
enterprises were not doing all that badly. In the first quarter 
of this year, profits and taxes handed over by the state-run 
sector to the government increased by 22 per cent, despite a 
drop in the tax rate. 
  Government revenue In the first four months of this year 
increased by 250 million yuan (HK$223 million) to reach 8.4 
billion yuan. State-run enterprises accounted for 70 per cent 
of that revenue. 
  The official said a central government pilot project to 
incorporate 100 state-run companies this year was on target. He 
admitted, however, that the companies were not yet selected but 
preparatory work had been completed and a decision should be 
made in July or August. In addition, provinces would be allowed 
to undertake their own experiments to incorporate state-owned 
industry. Sichuan, for one, wanted to value the assets of three 
dozen state-run enterprises and then sell them off. 
  However, one central Government concern was that the best 
enterprises were floating shares on stock markets in China and 
abroad, thus shedding some of their traditional responsibilities 
for workers' welfare expenses. In contrast, the enterprises in 
the worst financial shape had to continue to shoulder the heavy 
burdens of worker welfare. 
  The official said the government was confident it could 
bring 
inflation down from just over 20 per cent at the beginning of 
the year to under 13 per cent for the whole of 1994. For this 
to happen, inflation would have to drop to about seven or eight 
per cent in the second half of the year. Because of the high 
rate of inflation, price reforms originally slated for this year 
have been put off until 1995. The precise pace at which price 
reforms would proceed depended on inflation in the second half 
of this year, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, state-run shops in Beijing yesterday increased 
prices for some grains by as much as nearly 30 per cent. 
Top-quality flour rose from 1.56 yuan per kilo to 2.14 yuan and 
top-quality rice rose to 1.92 yuan a kilo from 1.60 yuan. 
Edible oil prices would also rise soon, shopkeepers said.

<F P=106> [By Shuang Mu: "`Coaching' Intended To Ensure Safe </F>
Listings"] 
  [Text] China is creating a framework for coaching 
companies that want to publicly issue stock and be listed on 
exchanges. 
  To ensure the quality of listed companies, the securities 
authorities now require enterprises to accept a six-month-long 
coaching by relevant departments before they publicly issue and 
list shares. 
  The coaching programme is intended to help enterprises 
convert their operations to those of shareholding companies, 
said Sun Xiaoliang, president of the China Shareholding Company 
Consulting Co. 
  Sun noted that shareholding has spread rapidly in recent 
years. 
  By the end of 1993, 189 State companies had become listed 
companies. 
  But some have not substantially changed their operational 
systems. Instead, they still conduct business under the 
original system and regulations. 
  According to the initial instruction plan, said Sun, the 
coaching period will be divided into two stages. 
  The first stage is to be finished before companies issue 
shares to the public. 
  This stage will focus on establishing new corporate systems 
that will make the enterprises responsible for their financial 
losses and profits. 
  The second stage, to be completed before companies are 
listed, will mainly examine the newly established corporate 
systems to ensure that they are put into effect, while studying 
problems in how they are run. 
  As to what kind of institutions are qualified to coach 
enterprises, Sun thinks they should have the following 
characteristics: 
  Firstly, they should understand precisely the purpose of the 
reform of the State economic system. 
  Secondly, they should be quite familiar with the substance 
of 
the various economic reforms. 
  Thirdly, they should fully grasp the policies, regulations 
and details of the modern corporate system. 
  Finally, they should have experience in helping enterprises 
transform their operational systems. 
  The institutions' qualifications should be formally examined 
by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State 
Commission for Economic Restructuring.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Go All Out To Rush Harvesting of </F>
Summer Grain"] 
  [Text] Governor Fu Xishou inspected summer harvesting work 
in some rural areas of four counties in Chuzhou and Suxian 
prefectures, and Bengbu city on 1 and 2 June, at a crucial 
moment in summer harvesting in areas along the Huai He and areas 
north of it. He said: It is very important to gather the good 
summer harvests. In northern Anhui, the summer crop alone can 
ensure food supply for the whole year. If the peasants have no 
worries about their livelihood, the rural situation will be 
stable, and rural stability is important to the stability and 
economic development of the whole province. He called on the 
cadres and people in those areas to take full advantage of fine 
days to go all out to rush the harvesting of summer grain crops; 
and to strive to get every seed of summer grain into the 
granaries. 
  When Governor Fu Xishou chaired an executive meeting of the 
provincial government on the afternoon of 31 May, he learned of 
a possible weather change in the near future. He was so anxious 
that he again checked the forecast with the provincial weather 
station in the evening, and decided to leave for the countryside 
immediately. During those two days, Governor Fu Xishou and his 
party travelled more than 500 km and inspected summer harvesting 
work in eight villages in Dingyuan county, Huaiyuan county, 
Suzhou city, and Lingbi county. On the afternoon of 1 June, Fu 
Xishou arrived at the wheat threshing ground of Qiaotouyang 
village in Xizhoudian township, Dingyuan county. He grabbed a 
handful of wheat grains and checked them carefully. He then 
held the hand of peasant Yang Dongyong and cordially asked him 
about the area of his wheat crops, the expected completion time 
for harvesting, and expected yield. Yang Dongyong answered all 
the questions. Then, a responsible comrade of Dingyuan county 
informed the governor that the harvesting of the county's 
850,000 mu of wheat could be completed in two days. Fu Xishou 
was satisfied with this information. In Huanyuan county and 
some other localities, Fu Xishou repeatedly told local 
responsible comrades to draw on the lessons of several previous 
years in which wheat mildewed due to continuous rain. He urged 
them to organize the labor force rapidly to rush the harvesting 
of summer grain crops, to avoid the loss of grain which was 
nearly in their hands, and to prevent the efforts made by 
peasants over last six months from being wasted. He called the 
departments concerned to provide good services to peasants. Fu 
Xishou saw the wheat crops in a large tract of land in the 
northern part of Lingbi county were not yet ripe. He asked the 
responsible comrades of the county to watch the weather forecast 
closely, be well prepared, and seize the opportune time to 
organize the peasants to rush harvesting and threshing of the 
crops, and to get the harvests into the granaries. 
  Fu Xishou also inspected some county-run enterprises and 
village and town enterprises during his tour.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province 
will open more markets and build a better investment 
environment, so as to make it a more attractive area for 
overseas businessmen. 
  Addressing a seminar on the provincial economy and foreign 
investment environment, Lu Ruihua, vice-governor of the 
province, said that Guangdong had used a total of 33.54 billion 
U.S. dollars of overseas investments by May this year. The 
funds helped the province achieve an annual growth of 13.8 
percent in its gross domestic product over the past decade. 
  As the province enjoys excellent conditions in both domestic 
and international environment, it plans to achieve the targets 
in China's modernization drive in 20 years. During this period, 
Guangdong will need at least 190 billion U.S. dollars in 
overseas investment. 
  To get this, the vice-governor said, Guangdong Province is 
ready to open its primary industries, secondary industries and 
service industries to overseas investment, except for some 
special fields. 
  Overseas investors are welcome to solely own or hold the 
larger share in stock-holding enterprises, apart from some 
infrastructure industries in which continued state monopoly is 
necessary, he said. 
  The province is particularly interested in capital 
investment 
from multinational business giants as well as small and 
medium-sized businesses. Industrial investment, bank loans and 
low-interest loans are all welcomed, he said. 
  Opening its market, the vice governor said, means to attract 
more overseas funds and introduce high technology. The higher 
the technology proportion, the more it will open its market. 
  The province will also allow overseas investors to purchase 
shares of local firms. But, assets appraisal and property 
ownership must be clarified before shares are sold and before 
permission is given to trade the stocks in the market, he said. 
In attracting overseas investment, the vice-governor said, 
Guangdong Province will do its utmost to protect the lawful 
rights of foreign investors and allow them to make profits. 
However, he also emphasized that supervision of the 
overseas-funded enterprises must be intensified as well in light 
of the growing number of labor conflicts. 
  Guangdong Province is ready to bring in regulations to 
protect the lawful rights and interests of both employers and 
employees. National policies and international common practice 
will be applied in the supervision of overseas-funded 
enterprises so as to make effective use of foreign investment 
and make Guangdong a more appealing place for overseas investors.

<F P=106> [Excerpts of the report on government work delivered by </F>
Chairman Gyaincain Norbu to the Second Session of the Sixth 
Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Congress; from the "News" 
program] 
  [Text] On the smooth progress in infrastructure 
construction focused on energy, transportation, and 
telecommunications projects, the report points out: The Gongga 
Airport expansion project was completed and put into operation. 
The paving of the main runway at Bangda Airport was basically 
completed. We have fulfilled our annual plans for improving the 
Sichuan-Tibet, Qinghai-Tibet, China-Nepal, and Ze-Gong Highways. 
The (Zhamu)-Medog Highway has been preliminarily opened to 
traffic. The Chalong power station at Yanghu overfulfilled its 
annual construction plan. Breakthrough progress was made in 
deep geothermal prospecting north of Yangbajing. 
  With the construction of telecommunications projects 
accelerating, the telephone service in seven prefectures, 
cities, and towns has become program-controlled. We have 
basically completed the earth and stone construction projects 
and the equipment installation for 61 satellite communications 
ground receiving stations. The satellite communications ground 
receiving stations and program-controlled telephone service have 
entered the stage of trial operations in seven prefectures and 
cities and 35 counties. 
  The report points out: The autonomous region's total 
import-export trade volume exceeded $100 million, a 60-percent 
increase over the previous year. In 1993, we received 23,000 
tourists from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign countries, 
and earned $9 million in foreign exchange from tourism. In 
1993, the autonomous region officially approved 41 projects to 
introduce investment from abroad and to establish same-level 
ties at home, with contracts involving the use of external 
capital of 67.1 million yuan and $9.63 million. In addition, 
the autonomous region set up 129 enterprises in coastal and 
other provinces and regions of our country. Last year, 855 new 
state-owned and collectively owned enterprises were established 
in Tibet, with a total registered capital of 830 million yuan; 
and 46 new private enterprises were set up, with a total 
registered capital of 7.31 million yuan. The autonomous region 
built and rebuilt 23 country markets, and the volume of retail 
commodity sales in Tibet was 1.9 billion yuan. In 1993, the 
region's local revenues totaled 156 million yuan, while the per 
capita income of peasants was 521 yuan, up 6.3 percent from 1992. 
  In 1993, the region set up 248 new schools of various 
categories, and the enrollment rate of school-age children rose 
2.7 percentage points over the previous year. Remarkable 
results were achieved in enrolling Tibetan students in schools 
in interior and coastal provinces. At present, nearly 11,000 
Tibetan students are attending those schools.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 11 (XINHUA) -- A campaign has been 
launched in this north China port city and industrial center 
against fake goods, an official said here today. 
  The event got started in the downtown area yesterday, and 
over 10,000 fake products worth 300,000 yuan were discovered, 
according to the top official with the municipal industry and 
commerce administration. 
  More than 400 administrators and local officials took part 
in 
yesterday's inspection of electronics products and appliances in 
more than 50 department stores and shops, the official said. 
  "Such fraud violates China's trademark and anti-unfair 
competition laws," said one of the law-enforcement personnel. 
  "In accordance with the law, imitations should be 
confiscated 
and the dealers punished," he said. 
  The French Merlin Gerin Company built a joint venture in 
Tianjin with its own funds in 1987 to produce electronic 
switches. Its sales in 1993 totaled 130 million yuan and its 
products hold a good reputation in both the domestic and world 
markets. 
  "Our products have been imitated since 1990," said Michel 
Collonge, French general manager of the company. "But we are 
still confident in China's efforts to protect intellectual 
property. This is the reason why we have decided to further 
expand our investment in Shanghai." 
  The Tianjin campaign has not been the only one so far, the 
official said. In other big cities across the country, such as 
Shanghai, Shenyang, Chengdu, Xian and Chongqing, efforts also 
have been made to crack down on activities of unfair 
competition, he added. 
  The procuratorial bodies in these parts of China have also 
brought producers and dealers of fraudulent goods to justice, 
the official said. 
  The French general manager spoke highly of the actions the 
Chinese Government has taken to fight against unfair 
competition. "We are feeling safer as China's legal system to 
protect foreign investors' intellectual property matures," he 
said.

<F P=106> [By Huang Huang (7806 3874), secretary of the Ningxia </F>
Regional CPC Committee: "China's Agriculture Faces a Second 
Major Change"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of last year, the party Central 
Committee and the State Council have repeatedly stressed the 
importance of agriculture, and have adopted a series of measures 
to protect peasants, lighten their heavy burdens, increase their 
income, and deepen rural reform. All these measures are well 
received by the vast numbers of peasants, and have also created 
opportunities for changing the current rural situation in which 
agricultural development is relatively lagging and rural reform 
confronts many difficulties. 
  The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is an agricultural and 
stock-raising province. In line with instructions of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, the party committee and 
government of the autonomous region have always regarded it as a 
guiding ideology for the rural work to care about the life of 
peasants, promote agriculture, improve conditions in rural 
areas, and consolidate the position of agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy. 
  In the wake of the national conference on rural work called 
by the central authorities last year, and in the light of both 
Ningxia's realistic conditions and the new situations and new 
changes that have cropped up in rural work, we have put into 
practice a series of measures to strengthen rural work and to 
deepen rural reform. They are chiefly the following: 
  1. The autonomous region has set up a leading group on rural 
work with a view to strengthening comprehensive coordination of 
rural work. 
  2. We have called a conference on rural work, at which an 
agricultural development plan featuring "one stress, three 
changes" was formulated. In other words, this plan aims, "by 
placing the stress on increasing the income of peasants, to 
change the traditional rural economy into a modern rural economy 
that is based on agriculture and guided by the secondary and 
tertiary industries, change the planned economic structure into 
a socialist market economic structure, and transform the old 
urban-rural relations and the dualistic structure under which 
urban and rural areas are divided and ruled into a new structure 
which tends to integrate urban with rural areas and narrow the 
gap between the two, thus accelerating economic development of 
rural areas." 
  3. We have paid close attention to implementation of 
measures on increasing both production and income. For 
instance, guided by the demands of the market and under the 
prerequisite of maintaining stable growth in grain production, 
we have exerted great efforts to develop easily marketed cash 
crops, such as wheat and side crops, and increased the capital 
input into agriculture, respectively attaining a growth of 13.1 
and over 23 percent over the previous year in budgetary funds 
for aiding agriculture and in the total amount of agricultural 
loans newly granted by banks. Moreover, we have paid close 
attention to first-stage preparations for the Daliushu Water 
Conservancy and Hydroelectric Key Project on the Huang He, the 
Yanhuan Water Positioning and Pumping Project which has a great 
bearing on three provinces and regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, and 
Ningxia, diversion works which channel the water of the Huang He 
into the Hetao area, projects of comprehensive agricultural 
development in the Hetao area, and a number of other key 
agricultural projects, including those of aiding the poor and 
improving the environment of poor areas that are currently 
carried out in three counties on the loess plateau. 
  4. Regarding it as one of the assessment criteria of their 
work, we have urged all units, trades, and industries across the 
autonomous region to implement aforementioned 
aid-the-agriculture measures through various channels, such as 
providing rural areas with joint and unit-to-unit support on 
specific projects. 
  5. By reforming the work evaluation system, we have further 
clarified to prefectures, cities, and counties, as well as rural 
cadres, the targets and tasks of agriculture and rural economic 
development, and urged them to focus their work on increasing 
the income of peasants. 
  All these measures have yielded remarkable results: We have 
successfully aroused the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of 
peasants, and helped them firmly establish the concept of 
stabilizing agriculture, developing the economy, and becoming 
rich by various means. 
  In our opinion, however, the fundamental way to solve 
problems of a deeper level in rural areas is to further push 
forward economic structural reform in rural areas. The reason 
the agricultural development plan of "one stress, three changes" 
is considered the key to rural economic structural reform is 
that it keeps to the general orientation of changing the old 
economic structure into a socialist market economic structure 
and it represents the fundamental way for us to develop 
agriculture and transform the mode and structure of rural 
production. 
  A comprehensive review of the process of rural reform in 
the past decade and longer has showed that although the 
contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to 
output did immensely arouse the enthusiasm of peasants at the 
beginning of reform, thus laying a solid foundation for 
comprehensive progress, there has not been a fundamental change 
to both the traditional unitary mode of rural production and the 
socialized structure under which urban and rural areas are 
divided and ruled in different ways. What is more, with the 
deepening of reform, especially after the socialist market 
economic structure is established, traditional agriculture and 
the dualistic urban-rural structure have proved bigger obstacles 
to rural development. This is a problem prevailing across the 
country. 
  For example, the residence registration and management 
system 
is a typical product of the dualistic urban-rural structure 
under the traditional planned economic structure. Facts have 
shown that by strictly restricting population flow between urban 
and rural areas, this system has not only tied peasants of the 
older generation to land, but also forced farmland that cannot 
be expanded indefinitely to bear more and more new rural 
laborers, resulting in waste of resources and declines in 
productivity. Such practice runs counter to the law of the 
market economy. In view of such a situation and in line with 
the relevant guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, we have vigorously conducted experiments 
with the residence registration and management system of small 
cities and townships, thus opening up a new path for freeing 
rural labor forces, which is warmly welcomed by peasants. As a 
matter of fact, Comrade Deng Xiaoping expounded the issue long 
ago: "Eighty percent of China's population are peasants. If the 
peasants lack enthusiasm in production, our country will have no 
hope of becoming stronger.... In my opinion, the only way for 
us to take now is to mobilize the enthusiasm of peasants, 
increase output of agricultural products by a large margin, and 
transfer rural productive forces in large numbers to newly built 
townships and towns and newly established medium and small 
enterprises. We cannot always tie peasants to their small 
pieces of land, for that practice promises no hope." 
  It seems that we have no alternative but to admit that to 
help peasants become rich, we first have to reduce their numbers. 
  If we say that the adoption of the contracted responsibility 
system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output 
is the first major change experienced by China's rural 
development, then it will prove a second major change to break 
with the dualistic urban-rural structure and to establish a 
modern agricultural production structure in line with the 
requirements of the socialist market economic structure.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 11 (CNA) -- The trial of the three 
men charged with robbing and murdering 32 people, including 24 
Taiwan tourists, aboard a boat on Qiandao Lake March 31 ended 
here Saturday [11 June], with the verdict to be delivered on 
Sunday. 
  The judge heard the last statements by the prosecutor, the 
defendants and their lawyers before he closed the hearing, which 
began Friday and lasted for two hours Saturday morning. 
  The three defendants -- Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun 
-- 
all pleaded guilty Friday. 
  No relatives of the Taiwan victims appeared at the court to 
protest Beijing's decision to limit access to the trial. 
  Beijing agreed to allow victims' relatives to attend the 
trial, but barred Taiwan reporters, lawmakers and Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) officials. Taiwan reporters were 
permitted to watch the trial via closed-circuit television. SEF 
is a semi-official organization authorized by Taiwan to handle 
private exchanges between the two sides in the absence of 
official contacts across the strait. 
  In Taipei, eight relatives of the victims held a news 
conference Friday, saying the trial was another attempt by 
Beijing to cover up the crime. 
  "Whatever the result of the trial, we will never accept it," 
a relative told reporters. 
  The Qiandao Lake incident occurred on March 31 when 32 
people 
were murdered and robbed aboard a pleasure boat ferrying them 
across the Zhejiang Province lake. Beijing did not publicize 
the incident until two days later and did not admit the deaths 
involved foul play until Taiwan threatened to review fragile 
cross-Taiwan Strait ties. 
  Beijing then arrested the three suspects and a fourth 
implicated in the incident and made public the alleged 
investigative report which many here said has raised more 
questions than it answers. 
  Different accounts of the incident have since emerged, with 
the latest one coming from legislator Parris Chang, a member of 
Taiwan's largest opposition group, the Democratic Progressive 
Party. 
  Chang told a recent seminar that the murder was carried out 
by a squad of some 10 People's Liberation Army soldiers who were 
executed shortly after the incident.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 13 (CNA) -- All three men charged 
with robbing and murdering 32 people, including 24 Taiwan 
tourists, aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake March 31 were 
sentenced to death by the Hangzhou intermediate people's court 
Sunday [12 June]. 
  The verdict, delivered during a 30-minute ceremony, 
completed 
the trial, referred to by victims' relatives in Taiwan as a 
"sham" and "nothing but a skit." 
  Announcing the verdict, prosecutors said the suspects robbed 
the tourists, killed them and blew up the boat. They called the 
crime serious and handed down two death sentences for each of 
the three men. 
  The evidence in the case, the prosecutors said, included 
reports prepared by public security police, written testimonies 
by witnesses and a videotape owned by a murdered Taiwan tourist 
discovered at the home of Wu Lihong, one of the three suspects. 
  According to Mainland China's criminal codes, the three 
defendants -- Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun -- have three 
days to appeal their sentences. 
  The fourth suspect, Wu Liming, who was prosecuted on charges 
of harboring goods stolen in the attack, was sentenced to three 
years in jail Monday. Wu Liming is a military police officer 
and the elder brother of Wu Lihong. 
  Huang Chin-kun, one of the victims' Taiwan relatives, called 
the death sentences predictable. However, he said, many 
questions raised by the relatives and Taipei's Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF), a conduit for communications between the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait, remained unanswered. 
  None of the Taiwan relatives appeared at the court to 
protest 
Beijing's decision to limit access to the trial and they did not 
want to give the impression that they were endorsing the 
verdicts, which they said they "will never accept." 
  Chuang Shu-fang, another relative, said judging from the 
videotapes of the trial, she doesn't believe the three suspects 
are the real murders. 
  The tapes showed that Hu Zhihan consulted his notes when 
answering questions and Wu Lihong even smiled during the trial. 
"How can a murderer forget what he has done and smile at a crime 
as heinous as this one," Chuang asked. 
  After the trial, SEF's Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-you 
expressed his indignation at the mainland's continuing refusal 
to talk with SEF about compensation for victims' relatives and 
signing an agreement securing Taiwan travelers' security in the 
mainland. 
  The Qiandao Lake incident occurred on March 31 when 32 
people 
were murdered and robbed aboard a pleasure boat ferrying them 
across the Zhejiang Province lake. Beijing did not publicize 
the incident until two days later and did not admit the deaths 
involved foul play until Taiwan threatened to review the fragile 
cross-Taiwan Strait ties.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Foreign 
Minister Tang Jiaxuan blamed the threatened withdrawal of North 
Korea from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the 
agency itself Tuesday [14 Jun], while calling the situation 
critical, a former Japanese defense minister said in Beijing. 
  Taku Yamasaki, a House of Representatives member of the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and his 
colleague met with Tang before leaving for a visit of "two or 
three" days to North Korea. 
  His visit comes a day after North Korea announced late 
Monday 
it will withdraw from the IAEA in retaliation to the IAEA's 
cancellation last Friday of technical assistance to Pyongyang. 
  "The IAEA sanctions caused this result, China abstained from 
voting (on the sanctions) and calls for a peaceful solution 
through dialogue," Yamasaki quoted Tang as saying. 
  "China is continuing consular efforts, we are doing this in 
a 
more positive way, but the North Korean attitude is very firm. 
I think our efforts will not be decisive," Tang was quoted as 
saying. 
  "The most important thing is not to force North Korea out of 
the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)," Tang told Yamasaki. 
"We are at a critical moment. The international community 
should promote a peaceful solution, mainly through dialogue 
between North Korea and the United States." 
  In Pyongyang, Yamasaki hopes to discuss with North Korean 
leaders recent developments concerning the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula and the ongoing consultations in the UN 
Security Council of sanctions on North Korea. 
  He said Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison 
Department of the Chinese Communist Party, said at a meeting 
Monday that China should not be counted on to abstain on 
Security Council sanctions on North Korea as they did on the 
IAEA sanctions. 
  "We have not decided what to do. We will decide according to 
the situation at the time," he quoted Li as telling him. 
  Yamasaki is also expected to discuss North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons program and its refusal to allow IAEA 
inspections of the refueling of a 5-megawatt experimental 
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Former President of the 
United States Jimmy Carter arrived here Monday [13 June] in a 
prelude to his visit to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), with the possibility of his mediation in 
Pyongyang's nuclear issue gaining widespread attention. 
  Carter, who is visiting the Korean peninsula as head of his 
private peace center, will meet South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu before passing 
through the heavily-fortified truce village of Panmunjom into 
the DPRK Wednesday. 
  He is expected to meet the DPRK's leader Kim Il-song who is 
reportedly waiting for Carter to deliver a message to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on his proposal for solving the nuclear 
problem. 
  The former U.S. President will return to Seoul on June 18 
via 
Panmunjom and meet again with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam before heading back to Washington. 
  Carter came at a time when the U.S., South Korea and Japan 
are seeking United Nations sanctions against the DPRK since 
Pyongyang reportedly banned inspectors of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel 
to determine whether it has been diverted secretly to make 
atomic weapons. 
  The DPRK has repeatedly stated that its nuclear program is 
peaceful and warned that imposition of sanctions would be an act 
of war. 
  Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula 
would be private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the 
important issues of the day with leaders of the area," he added. 
  The former president has been active in resolving conflicts 
in Panama, Nicaragua and Sudan, among others.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP) -- China reaffirmed its 
sovereignty claim over the Spratly Islands on Tuesday and 
attacked oil exploration in the area by other countries. "China 
has irrefutable sovereignety over the Nansha Islands (Spratlys) 
and its adjacent waters," a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP. 
"Any country's exploration and exploitation activities of oil 
and gas there should not damage" China's interests, he added. 
  The comment came in reply to a question on the Philippines 
allowing Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and U.S. partner 
Vaalco Energy Inc. to begin preliminary exploration work near 
the disputed South China Sea chain. Philippine energy officials 
insisted Tuesday the area where the exploration would be 
conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a chain of atolls in 
the South China Sea claimed wholly by China and in part by 
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil 
and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. Two 
other U.S. firms, Crestone Energy Corp. and Mobil are already 
exploring part of the area on behalf of the Chinese and 
Vietnamese governments respectively. Both governments 
vehemently criticised each other's moves.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Files recording the 
Japanese massacre in Nanjing in 1937, which were discovered here 
in late 1992, are expected to be published shortly. 
  The massacre record, more than 20,000 words long, was kept 
in 
the files of the formerly Japanese Manchu Railway Company. It 
was unearthed at the end of 1992 in an archive in Shenyang, 
capital of north-east China's Liaoning Province. 
  The record, in Japanese, says that the Shanghai office of 
the 
Japanese company took part in burying more than 30,000 of the 
people killed in the massacre. 
  It notes that over 600 men participated in the burying, 
which 
took three months. 
  "It was a hard job," it says, and refers to the problems 
caused by warm weather. 
  According to the record, the population of the city of 
Nanjing dropped drastically by 80 percent after the Japanese 
occupation. 
  The Japanese railway company was a colonialist institution 
set up by the Japanese invaders in north-east China at the end 
of Japanese-Russian War, mainly engaged in railway management, 
and also involved in mining, industry and agriculture, politics, 
economy and military affairs. 
  It was responsible for economic take-overs for the Japanese 
aggressors and provided a large amount of war materials for them.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) announced here Monday [13 
June] that it would immediately withdraw from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and reject any inspections of its 
nuclear facilities, local newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" reported 
today. 
  The DPRK strongly accused the IAEA of committing an act of 
grave encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK, 
saying that it is a prelude to U.N. "sanctions". 
  On June 10, the IAEA adopted a resolution urging the DPRK to 
open its "military facilities" and suspend the agency's 
assistance to the DPRK. 
  In response to the IAEA's resolution, the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry was authorized to declare as follows: 
  Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA. We will 
consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions" adopted by 
the agency with regard to our issue and will not be bound to any 
rules or resolutions of the agency hereafter. 
  Without the agency we can develop our independent nuclear 
power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm 
of nuclear activities. 
  Secondly, we declare that inspections for the continuity of 
safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will no 
longer be allowed. 
  No unreasonable inspection can be allowed until a decision 
has been made for us to return to the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty or to completely withdraw from it. 
  Hence, the agency's inspectors will have nothing to do any 
more in our country. 
  Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that U.N. 
"sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. 
  The statement said that the DPRK's position will never 
change 
until the nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue 
and negotiation.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP) -- China on Tuesday declined 
to comment on North Korea's announced threat to quit the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), saying it had yet to 
receive official confirmation of a walkout. "We have taken note 
of the relevant report, but have not got official information," 
a foreign ministry spokesman said. "We will follow closely the 
development of the situation." 
  North Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Monday 
that 
Pyongyang was withdrawing from the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog 
organisation, three days after the IAEA adopted sanctions 
against it. China, the closest major ally to the isolated 
Stalinist state, abstained in the vote and reiterated that it 
would not join moves to approve economic sanctions at UN level. 
It insists on dialogue with Pyongyang as a means of resolving 
the 13-month-long crisis. 
  Meanwhile, KCNA, monitored in Tokyo, said a North Korean 
military delegation returned home Monday after visiting China. 
The delegation was headed by Choe Kwang, a member of the 
Politburo and chief of staff of the North Korean armed forces. 
The dispatch gave prominence to Chinese pledges of continuing 
support and loyalty to North Korea. It quoted General Liu 
Huaqing, a member of the standing committee of the Chinese 
communist party's Politburo and deputy chairman of the central 
military commission, as saying "friendly relations between the 
two countries ... have reached a higher phase and been 
consolidated today." "The people of China treasure Sino-Korean 
friendship and will pass it on from generation to generation," 
he was quoted by KCNA as saying.

  [Text] Vienna, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said here tonight that it had no 
knowledge of the withdrawal of the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea (DPRK) from the IAEA. 
  Hans Meyer, a spokesman for the IAEA, said that the DPRK 
could not have withdrawn from the IAEA because the IAEA had not 
received any notification of a withdrawal from the DPRK. 
  He added that the two nuclear inspectors from the IAEA in 
the 
DPRK had not reported anything abnormal and that inspection work 
would continue, in accordance with the regulations of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, even if the DPRK was to 
announce its withdrawal.

relations between the DPRK and China corresponds with the desire 
of the two countries' peoples and that the DPRK highly evaluates 
China's efforts to develop bilateral friendly relations. He 
said that he believes that the bilateral friendly relations 
would further develop and be consolidated. 
  During the meeting, the military leaders of the two 
countries 
share the view on activating the military exchange between the 
two countries.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji held talks with Brian Howe, Australian deputy prime 
minister and minister for housing and regional development, on 
Sino- Australian relations, bilateral trade as well as issues 
concerning urban construction. 
  Zhu said that Sino-Australian friendly cooperative relations 
have enjoyed satisfactory development in recent years, with 
frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two 
countries, large- scale increasement [word as received] in 
bilateral trade and continuous expansion of economic and 
technological cooperation. 
  The current visit by Howe is an another major event in 
bilateral relations, which will be significant for the mutually 
beneficial cooperation between the two countries, Zhu said. 
  China has adopted a series of important reform measures in 
taxation, finance, investment and foreign trade system and 
achieved positive results, Zhu said, adding that these have 
injected new power in developing Sino-Australian trade, economic 
and technological cooperation. 
  China is conducting reforms in its urban construction and it 
needs to learn advanced technology and experience from other 
countries, Zhu said, adding that China is willing to exchange 
experience and cooperate with Australia in this regard. 
  Howe said that China's high-speed economic development has 
attracted world's attention, and that Australia attaches great 
importance to developing friendly cooperation with China. 
  He said that Australia supports China's resumption of its 
status as GATT's signatory state and would like to work with 
China to this end. 
  Howe said the economies of China and Australia are mutually 
complementary and conducting bilateral cooperation is in line 
with the interests of both countries. 
  Australia and China should be cooperation partners and 
should 
explore new ways and fields for bilateral cooperation, said Howe. 
  The Australian visitors arrived here this afternoon at the 
invitation of the Chinese Government. Chen Jinhua, Chinese 
minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, met with 
Howe this afternoon.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (AFP) -- Australian Deputy Prime 
Minister Brian Howe said here Monday he believed charges would 
soon be brought against an Australian businessman, James Peng, 
held in a Chinese jail since October. Howe, who arrived here 
Friday for an eight-day China visit, said he had made clear in a 
meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji that "an Australian 
citizen being held and not charged is unacceptable." 
  Zhu had acknowledged it was "a poor reflection of the 
(Chinese judicial) system" and pledged to do his best to resolve 
the issue, but stressed that Peng's suspected involvement in 
corruption was "very serious," Howe told journalists. His 
understanding was that charges would be brought soon, he said. 
  Peng, 35, was seized by police in Macao in October and then 
handed over to Chinese police. He has since been held in the 
Meiling Detention Centre in the southern city of Shenzhen. 
Under Chinese law, suspects may be held for no longer than five 
months without charges. 
  Howe said he had discussed human rights more broadly during 
a 
meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng on Monday, but acknowledged 
that the talks had not progressed beyond a "philosophical" 
debate on the importance of mutual concern for problems in each 
other's countries. The official said the overall development of 
bilateral relations remained limited by this "inability to 
communicate effectively around the issue of human rights." He 
received little response when he reiterated Canberra's 
long-standing invitation for a Chinese human rights delegation 
to visit Australia. 
  On China's nuclear test last Friday, Howe said he had once 
again expressed Australia's concern, telling his Chinese 
interlocuters that such actions were inconsistent with Beijing's 
commitment to move towards a test ban by 1996. Chinese 
officials responded by reiterating that other nuclear powers had 
carried out many more tests and that the ball was in their court 
to reduce their stocks to achieve "a situation of parity," Howe 
said, predicting that more Chinese tests may well be in the 
pipeline. 
  During Howe's visit the two sides signed a memorandum of 
understanding on the potential of cooperation in the 
construction sector. How is to travel to Shanghai after 
visiting Yantai in northeastern Shandong province. He is to 
attend the signing in Shanghai of a joint venture agreement to 
manufacture steel building rods. Howe was to leave Beijing for 
Yantai Monday evening.

<F P=106> [Article by Wen Jiabao (3306 3367 1405): "It Is Necessary </F>
To Deepen Rural Reform and Promote Agriculture to New Heights"] 
  [Text] With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks in 
early 1992 and the 14th party congress as a milestone, China's 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization entered a new 
phase of development, and so did rural economic restructuring. 
<H5>  I. The New Situation Facing Rural Reform </H5>
  In the wake of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, China's countryside took the lead in 
conducting reform, scoring achievements that attracted world 
attention. Through reform over a dozen years or so, the rural 
economic structure has undergone profound changes: First, the 
highly centralized people's commune structure was abolished, and 
the contract responsibility system on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output, in the main, and the two-tier 
managerial structure characterized by the combination of 
centralization and separation set up. Second, diversified 
economic factors and forms were developed, with a pattern taking 
shape of the common development of diversified economic factors, 
with public ownership as the main body. Third, under the 
prerequisite of maintaining steady growth in grain and cotton 
output, the rural industrial setup was readjusted, diversified 
management and enterprises in towns and townships was developed, 
economic ties between urban and rural areas were expanded, and 
rural division of labor was considerably developed. Fourth, the 
system of state monopoly in the purchase and marketing of farm 
produce was gradually abolished; the farm produce market has 
greatly developed; and markets of such essentials as land, labor 
force and capital are taking shape. Fifth, the state's 
macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and the 
rural economy has been improved, and increasingly has adopted 
economic means to regulate rural economic activities, with the 
market role obviously expanded. Reform has effectively promoted 
agricultural and rural economic development. Consequently, the 
rural areas have undergone a historical change, while laying a 
foundation for the reform and development of the entire national 
economy. 
  Generally speaking, the rural areas today are still in the 
process of converting from the old to the new structure, and the 
tasks of reform are from being completed. The old structure has 
not been entirely eradicated, and is still functioning in some 
aspects; whereas the new structure has just been built, and is 
still incomplete and imperfect in many aspects. The rural 
managerial main body and property right system are incomplete 
and imperfect, the rural market is not highly developed, and a 
macroeconomic regulation and control system meeting the demands 
of the socialist market economy has not been set up. The 
contradictions and problems surfacing in rural economic 
operations are problems in the process of the old structure 
converting to the new, the reflection of their conflict and 
contradictions in progress. The fundamental way of resolving 
the contradictions and problems in rural economic development 
lies in deepening reform. 
  With the comprehensive transition of the entire national 
economy to the socialist market economy, new requirements are 
levied on the deepening of rural reform. In recent years, the 
rural areas have been faced with some new problems urgently 
awaiting solution; these are mainly a drop in the comparative 
economic returns of agriculture -- especially grain and cotton 
production -- the widening price gap between industrial and 
agricultural products, and slow increase in peasants' income. 
It is imperative to stabilize the party's basic policies for 
the rural areas, accelerate rural economic development, and 
further augment the basic role of agriculture. All this calls 
for voluminous work, and continuous arduous exploration. It is 
necessary to promote the rational flow and combination of 
various rural production essentials, and to realize the optimal 
allocation of economic resources on the basis of stabilizing the 
contract responsibility system on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output. Under the prerequisite of 
ensuring effective supplies of major farm produce, it is 
necessary to develop diversified management, enterprises in 
townships and towns, and other industries; to promote 
on-the-spot transfers of surplus rural work force and the export 
of labor service in an orderly way; and to realize effective 
supplies of farm produce and a simultaneous increase in 
peasants' income. Under the conditions in which peasant 
households' separate production is conducted on a small scale, 
it is imperative to actively develop the rural market, further 
invigorate circulation, augment the opening up of the rural 
economy, and achieve the dovetailing of production with the 
market. In the course of developing the socialist market 
economy, it is imperative to augment the government's guidance, 
support, protection, regulation and control of the agriculture, 
and gradually to narrow the gap in economic development and 
income level between urban and rural areas and localities. 
These issues have a bearing not only on rural reform and 
development, but also on the overall situation of China's 
reform, opening up, and modernization. We must to do a good job 
in solving them in a down-to-earth way in the next step of 
in-depth rural reform. 
  Compared with the past, rural reform -- from day one to 
the present -- boasts some new characteristics: First, rural 
reform increasingly has touched upon deep-level interest 
contradictions; it is imperative to be very meticulous in the 
design of reform plans, the selection of timing, and the grasp 
of magnitude. Second, rural reform increasingly has interwoven 
with urban reform. In many aspects, it is very difficult for 
rural reform to go it alone; that being the case, rural and 
urban reform should be conducted in coordination in a whole 
range. The difficulty and complexity of rural reform have 
increased greatly. In this context, rural reform has entered a 
stage of tackling the bottleneck; the tasks for reform are more 
arduous, with greater efforts involved in deepening reform than 
in the past. 
<H5>  II. Correctly Grasp the Goal of Rural Reform </H5>
  The 14th party congress set the goal of China's economic 
restructuring to be building the socialist market economy 
structure. That was proposed on the basis of our party 
persisting in the truth-seeking ideological line, referring to 
the experiences of various countries, especially summarizing 
China's successful experiences in reform and opening up, and a 
creative development of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought at 
that. "The Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee further set out the basic 
framework of the socialist market economy structure, which is 
the general plan and program for action for economic 
restructuring in China. Rural reform is an important component 
in building the socialist market economy structure, and plays a 
very important role in the entire economic restructuring in 
China. It is imperative for us to focus closely on the general 
goal of building the socialist market economy structure so as to 
further deepen rural reform. 
  From the very start, rural reform has been market oriented, 
with two important characteristics: First, it allowed the 
peasants sufficient say in production and operation to give play 
to the enthusiasm of the broad numbers of peasants. Second, it 
led agriculture and the rural economy into the market, while 
giving play to the role of the market mechanism. The rural 
areas were one step ahead in building the socialist market 
economy structure. The tremendous success of rural reform has 
provided evidence of the correctness of its orientation. 
  Today, China's rural areas are in a stage of change, from 
having sufficient food and clothing to being comparatively 
well-off, and from traditional to modern agriculture. 
Agricultural and rural economic development face two extremely 
arduous tasks: First, to ensure effective supplies of farm 
produce. Second, to ensure a steady increase in peasants' 
income. Fulfillment of these two goals calls for adopting 
measures in various aspects, and the most fundamental is to 
adhere to and deepen rural reform based on the general planning 
and requirements of building the socialist market economy 
structure. 
  Ensuring effective supplies of farm produce is the 
foundation 
for the smooth going of the entire cause of reform, opening up, 
and modernization. The per-capita possession of agricultural 
resources in China is limited, and it is very difficult to 
change the trend of shrinking amounts of arable land. With the 
population growth and elevation in income level, social demand 
for major farm produce will continue to grow. It is this which 
calls on us to attach great importance to the supply-and-demand 
balance of major farm products -- by no means should we be 
careless about it. To ensure the effective supply of farm 
products, the most fundamental point is to protect and give play 
to the peasants' enthusiasm, and to augment the basic role of 
agriculture so as to promote steady agricultural development. 
This precisely calls for formulating a price policy that is 
helpful to the production development of such major farm 
products as grains, cotton, and oil; to deepen purchase and 
marketing restructuring; and to improve agriculture's 
comparative economic returns. It is necessary to rely on 
science and technology to develop high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-return agriculture, and to improve agricultural labor 
productivity. It is imperative to increase the input of the 
state, the collective, and individuals so as to augment 
comprehensive agricultural production capability. 
  Increasing peasants' income is an overall issue that has a 
bearing on China's economic development and social stability. 
To increase peasants' income, it is imperative gradually to 
narrow the gap between industrial and agricultural products by 
means of a rational price policy. However, to basically resolve 
the issue of peasants' income in a country like ours which has a 
great population -- and a great agricultural populace, in 
particular -- it is not enough to rely on the government's price 
policy alone. The most fundamental way is to comprehensively 
develop the rural economy, and improve the comprehensive 
economic returns of the rural economy. This precisely calls for 
doing a good job in comprehensive agricultural development; 
exploiting non-arable land such as waste hills, water surface, 
grasslands, beaches, courtyards and backyards; and implementing 
the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in a big way. It is 
necessary to develop an appropriate scope of operations in 
places where conditions are ripe so as to elevate the degree of 
intensiveness. It is necessary to regulate the rural economic 
structure, take an active part in developing secondary and 
tertiary industries, and develop all sorts of products with 
additional value under the prerequisite of ensuring the steady 
growth of such major farm produce as grain and cotton. It is 
imperative to guide enterprises in towns and townships toward 
appropriate concentration and toward linking with the 
construction of small towns so as to accelerate the transfer of 
the surplus rural work force, while creating conditions for an 
appropriate scope of operations in agricultural development. 
  Whether in ensuring supplies of farm produce or increasing 
peasants' income, it is imperative to give play to the role of 
the market mechanism, so that the market may play a basic role 
in allocating resources. For this reason, it is necessary to 
develop the product market in a big way, and actively develop 
the production factors market in order to instill new vitality 
in the entire agricultural production and rural economy, and to 
promote growth in the general supply volume of farm produce. It 
is necessary to promote rural economic restructuring to achieve 
the rational allocation of various economic resources so that 
the comparative advantages of various localities may be given 
full play, and so the peasants' income can continue to grow in 
the comprehensive development of the rural economy. 
  We must have a clear idea that in order to develop the 
socialist market economy by no means should we let agriculture 
go it alone. Agriculture has a long production period and is 
greatly affected by natural factors. It is a department with 
low direct economic returns, but a high degree of social 
effects, and is more often than not in an unfavorable position 
in market competition. Peasant households in China operate on a 
very small scale, with very weak ability to resist natural and 
market risks. For a long time, China has relied on agriculture 
to accumulate funds for industrial development. Consequently, 
agricultural infrastructure conditions are weak. The per-capita 
possession of agricultural resources is very limited, with 
comparatively obvious restriction of resources in increasing 
effective supplies of farm produce. These characteristics 
decide that in the course of introducing the market mechanism to 
the agricultural arena, major fluctuations in the supply of farm 
produce are hardly avoidable, and it is very difficult to ensure 
the steady growth in peasants' income if the government fails to 
adopt the necessary supportive measures along with effective 
marcroeconomic regulation and control. Of course, the 
macroeconomic regulation and control we refer to does not mean 
to return to administrative ways of the traditional structure 
toward agriculture, but to conduct effective regulation chiefly 
through economic and legal means so as to mend the insufficiency 
of the market, support and protect agriculture, promote market 
stability and prosperity, and protect the interests of the 
peasants and consumers. 
  The transition of agriculture to the socialist market 
economy 
structure is a process during which it is imperative for us to 
firmly grasp the goal of rural reform and work hard to create 
conditions, while continuing to guide in-depth rural reform 
<H5>  III. The Major Tasks for Deepening Rural Reform </H5>
  According to the basic work principle the Central 
authorities 
have decided for 1994, and the requirements of "grasping the 
opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability," the basic tasks for 
rural work are to earnestly implement the "Decision of the 
Central Committee on Building the Socialist Market Economy 
Structure" and the spirit of the central rural work conference, 
to deepen rural reform, to further give play to the peasants' 
enthusiasm, and to promote rural economic development so as to 
improve peasants' income and maintain rural social stability. 
In deepening rural reform at present, it is imperative to focus 
on grasping the following issues: 
  First, on the basis of stabilizing the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration 
linked to output, it is necessary to promote the rational flow 
of rural production essentials and to achieve the optimal 
allocation of rural economic resources. 
  The two-tier managerial structure, on the foundation of the 
contract responsibility system on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output, is a basic economic system in the 
rural areas which must be stabilized for a long time, and 
continuously completed and perfected. Under this prerequisite, 
it is imperative to meet the need of the rural division of labor 
and readjustment of the industrial setup, so that various rural 
production essentials -- including work force, land and funds -- 
may flow reasonably, while continuously optimizing their way of 
combination. That is the inherent requirement on the 
development of the rural productive force, as well as the basic 
channel for accelerating rural economic development and 
improving peasants' income. 
  With the deepening of reform in recent years, various rural 
production essentials have begun to flow, with their 
reorganization under way. Regarding land, a small number of 
comparatively economically developed regions have begun to adopt 
various forms -- including the transfer of contracted land and 
converting land-use rights to shares, as well as the development 
in rural division of labor -- to develop an appropriate scale of 
operation on the land. Some impoverished areas have stepped up 
the exploitation of nonarable land resources through auctioning 
land-use rights of "four wastes." Some peasants from 
economically underdeveloped areas have gone to the rural areas 
of economically developed regions to contract land. Regarding 
funds and work force, they too are flowing in various ways. The 
central authorities have earnestly summarized these creations of 
the peasants, and have set out a series of measures for 
deepening reform: Under the prerequisite of persisting in the 
collective ownership of land, the contracted period of arable 
land is extended, while allowing the inheritance of contracted 
operational right of developmental production projects and the 
transfer of land-use right with compensation according to the 
law. Enterprises in towns and townships are guided to 
appropriately concentrate in small towns, and their household 
registration control system will undergo gradual reform, while 
allowing peasants to enter small towns to work and do business. 
The rural cooperative foundation will be standardized, so that 
it may become a communal organization of mutual-aid in funds, 
while refraining from operation in saving deposits and loans, 
but serving agriculture and the peasants within the realm of the 
community. 
  To promote the rational flow of rural production factors on 
a 
still larger scale, the key lies in the shaping of a sound 
flowing mechanism, finding a flow pattern and form of 
combination in conformity with various conditions, while 
creating a sound external environment for the flow of production 
factors. In recent years, various categories of the 
shareholding cooperative system have surfaced in the rural areas 
which are playing an increasingly greater role in promoting the 
flow of production factors and the rational allocation of 
resources. They should be given great attention. Such 
organizational forms have a certain adaptability in many rural 
arenas, and have become an important operational organizational 
form, which gradually must be standardized on the basis of 
earnestly summarizing experiences. We should guard against 
rushing headlong into developing the shareholding cooperative 
system, but we should not violate mass voluntariness or resort 
to administrative means in compulsory implementation. The 
shareholding cooperative system should not be regarded only as a 
means for fundraising. Attention should be paid to clarifying 
property rights relations, converting operational mechanisms, 
and shaping effective assets accumulation. There are other good 
forms in the combination of rural production factors. It is 
imperative to select the proper form by proceeding from the 
actual conditions and suiting measures to local conditions; we 
should not confine ourselves to any specific way. 
  Second, it is necessary to develop intermediary market 
organizations in a big way and to adopt various ways to 
effectively link peasant households' production operations with 
the market. 
  The peasant household operates on a small scale in China. 
Under the condition of the gradual opening of operation in farm 
production, it is imperative to promote the development of 
intermediary market organizations in a big way. That is an 
important aspect in completing and perfecting the rural market 
system, and it must be grasped as an important task in deepening 
rural reform. 
  We must encourage diversified forms in developing 
intermediary market organizations. There already are now 
various forms of economic bodies, such as 
trade-industry-agriculture combinations; production, supply and 
marketing shaping into a whole range; and companies with 
participation of peasant households; in addition to various 
categories of associations of specialized technology for 
peasants -- all of which are effective organizational forms to 
link peasant households to the market, with bright propects for 
their developmnet. We must give them all-out support and 
promote their even more rapid development. 
  To better protect the peasants' interests based on China's 
national conditions, while referring to successful world 
experiences, it is necessary to pay special attention to 
developing cooperative economic organizations in various 
categories and to guide the peasants to enter the market. To 
develop rural cooperative economic organizations, the key lies 
in proceeding from the inherent requirements of economic 
development and showing full respect for the peasants' will, 
while genuinely persisting in the basic principle of cooperative 
economy. It is necessary to link up with the building of the 
agricultural socialized service system and to focus on 
circulation, processing, and other agricultural service arenas. 
The development of cooperative economic organizations in these 
arenas is beneficial to protecting the peasants' interests and 
to developing the rural economy, and the peasants welcome such 
practices. Supply and marketing cooperatives at various levels 
should continue to deepen reform, and genuinely make themselves 
the peasants' cooperative economic organizations. They should 
take an active part in exploring new paths for development in 
the direction of comprehensive service organizations. Village 
collective economic organizations should actively run economic 
bodies in the service trade so as to render service to household 
operations, while gradually accumulating assets to magnify 
collective economic strength. In a nutshell, it is necessary to 
proceed from the peasants' actual needs; develop diversified 
intermediary organizations; link the peasants to the market; and 
promote the rural division of labor so that agriculture may 
develop in the direction of being specialized, socialized, and 
converting to commodity. 
  Third, it is imperative to strengthen the government's 
macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture. 
  The government's macroeconomic regulation and control mainly 
embody support for agricultural production and protection of 
peasants' interests. Mainly economic means are adopted in 
macroeconomic regulation and control. At present, it is 
especially necessary to grasp work as follows: First, it is 
necessary to work hard to increase agricultural input. In the 
course the market economy development, all sorts of production 
factors are driven by interest, and follow those industries that 
yield high economic returns; consequently, agriculture more 
often than not is placed in an unfavorable position. This 
precisely requires the government to augment its support and 
protection of agriculture in a down-to-earth way. This being 
the case, it is imperative to readjust the distribution pattern 
in the national economy and to increase the proportion of 
national investment in capital construction, funds in financial 
budget, and loans for agricultural purpose so as to gradually 
increase agricultural input. At the same time, we should 
enthusiastically encourage the peasants and collectives to 
increase labor and capital input to continuously improve 
agricultural production conditions, and to augment the material 
and technological foundation of agriculture. Second, it is 
necessary to augment and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control over the farm produce market. We should strengthen 
market control, standardize market behavior, and do a good job 
in the regulatory storage structure so as to maintain market 
stability. It is necessary to deepen the restructuring of grain 
and cotton purchasing and marketing; firmly grasp the founding, 
completion, and perfection of the regulatory storage system and 
market risk fund; ensure supplies; and protect the interests of 
the producer and consumer. Third, it is imperative to protect 
peasants' interests in a down-to-earth way. We must support 
industrial development for agricultural purposes, do a good job 
in supplying agricultural production materials, and earnestly 
resolve such issues as insufficient supplies of chemical 
fertilizers and diesel oil, and excessive high prices. We must 
unremittingly do a good job of monitoring and control of 
peasants' burdens, which must be reduced with continuous efforts 
so as to protect their economic interests. Fourth, it is 
necessary to establish, complete, and perfect the socialized 
service system. We should proceed from the peasants' actual 
needs, develop diversified service organizations, and shape a 
service network characterized by the combination of village 
collective economic organizations, state economic and 
technological departments, and various specialized technological 
associations jointly organized by the peasants. 
  To deepen rural reform, it is necessary to have a clear 
picture of the goal and tasks, while simulaneously paying 
attention to methods. Many experiences in rural reform over the 
past dozen years or so should be inherited and brought forward. 
First, we must persist in emancipating our minds, seeking 
truth from facts, proceeding from actual conditions in 
everything, experimenting boldly, allowing to wait and see, and 
refraining from argument, while paying attention to summarizing 
experiments. Second, we must show full respect for the 
peasants' spirit of initiative, and link mass spontaneous 
invention with active guidance by the leadership. 
  Third, 
regarding major reform measures, in some cases they should be 
unfolded by being shaped into a whole range, with related 
departments according to different conditions, with plans 
formulated first. In other cases, experiments should be 
conducted in partial areas and the experience gained should be 
spread. Fourth, work in this arena should be conducted in order 
of the degrees of difficulty, by starting from the comparatively 
easier link and area to realize a stable transition step by 
step. Fifth, we must persist in linking reform with 
development. The bottlenecks in development should be regarded 
as the key to reform, while promoting development through 
reform. In short, we should always persist in weighing the 
acceptance or rejection of various reform measures and should 
determine their success or failure by the basic criteria -- 
namely, whether or not they are helpful to developing the 
socialist social productive force, whether or not they are 
helpful in augmenting the comprehensive national strength of the 
socialist country, whether or not they are helpful to improving 
people's living standards -- so that reform may win an extensive 
and profound mass foundation. 
  In the course of rural reform and development, another 
extremely important issue is precisely to strengthen the 
building of rural grass-roots organizations, spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and the legal system, so that the rural 
material and spiritual civilizations may enjoy synchronous 
development. For this reason, we should at all times persist in 
the principle of "doing two types of work simultaneously, 
attaching equal importance to both" so as to achieve synchronous 
development of the material and spiritual civilizations in rural 
areas. At present, many rural grass-roots organizations are in 
a state of weakness and relaxation, and some do not even play 
any role. Social order is unsatisfactory in some places, with 
strong resentment from the peasants. In other places, feudal 
superstition is on the rise, with all sorts of ugly phenomena 
rising and spreading. Should no solutions be found to these 
problems, reform and development will be affected and the 
party's foundation in the rural areas will be endangered. If 
spiritual civilization fails to develop, material civilization 
will not develop, either. Even if the material civilization 
develops for a while, it will retrogress in the end. While 
studying rural reform and development, we should by no means 
neglect this point. 
  In the course of building the socialist market economy 
structure, the tasks involved in rural reform are great and 
arduous. It is imperative for us to adhere to Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and to the basic line of the party, under the 
leadership of the Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
its core, and earnestly implement the party's various rural 
principles and policies to deepen rural reform, push agriculture 
up a new plane, lay a solid foundation, and create sound 
conditions for ensuring the smooth going of the entire economic 
restructuring and the sustained, rapid and healthy development 
of the national economy.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP)--Chinese dissident Wang Dan 
threatened Tuesday to go on hunger strike to protest the 
constant police surveillance to which he has been subjected 
since returning to Beijing at the weekend. In a telephone call 
to AFP, the former 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement student 
leader said he feared for his safety. "Two plain clothes police 
accompany me wherever I go, walking alongside me and fixing me 
with menacing looks," he said. Wang Dan, 24, said that four or 
five other police in plain clothes and uniform are outside his 
home day and night. 
  "Neighbours have complained about the situation and my 
mother 
has gone today (Tuesday) to the local police station to get this 
persecution stopped. If the police are still there Wednesday at 
9:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) I will start a hunger strike," said Wang, 
who returned to Beijing after spending time in Shandong 
province, east China, to avoid trouble with police during the 
fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP) -- Two young avant-garde 
artists arrested here at the weekend are still being held by 
police, their friends said Tuesday. Ma Liumin, 25, and Zhu Min, 
22, were arrested when about a dozen uniformed and plainclothes 
police descended on an informal art show organized by the two at 
their home in the city's eastern Chaoyang district just as it 
wound up Sunday afternoon, witnesses said. 
  Police Tuesday again raided the artists' home, where a 
number 
of painters live, and took away paintings and materials, the 
friends said. 
  Police refused to comment, although Monday they confirmed 
the 
raid, but gave no details. 
  "Ma was nude during the gathering but his show was purely 
artistic and had no political message," one of the artist's 
friends said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa by </F>
staff reporter Ma Ling (7456 3781), in Beiing; date not given: 
"Zhang Baifa -- Commoner Turned a Mayor of Beijing"] 
  [Text] Zhang Baifa has been serving as vice mayor of 
Beijing for 14 years, under four different superiors; he is the 
eldest in terms of seniority and can be regarded as the most 
well-known. Owing to his background and character, some people 
call him the "commoner mayor," and because of his "rise" and 
merits, some people call him the "construction worker turned 
mayor." In any case, no matter how you address him, his unique 
character and characteristics as a mayor have been recognized 
unanimously. 
  When people mention Zhang Baifa, their thoughts turn to a 
series of buildings put up in Beijing after the nation's 
founding because his name can be linked to many large and small 
construction projects in Beijing: From the eight major 
colleges, the Friendship Guest House, the Great Hall of the 
People, and the Museum of History in the 1950's, to the Asian 
Games Village, the project of transforming the second and third 
loops, the capital's airport expressway, the Beijing West 
Passenger Station, and the Healthy Housing Project in the 
1990's. Zhang Baifa, who has been serving as vice mayor of 
Beijing since 1981 and thus has become an "elder having served 
four superiors," is in charge of urban construction. Along with 
the emergence of the magnificent breadth of spirit of the 
ancient capital -- Beijing -- and the successful organization of 
the 11th Asian Games in Beijing and Beijing's vigorous bid to 
host the 2000 Olympic Games in the international community, 
Zhang Baifa's reputation and influence are no longer linked only 
to buildings in Beijing, but have followed the outward extension 
and expansion of construction projects to places outside the 
country, like China's sports undertakings -- flying across the 
ocean to places outside the mainland. 
<H5>  "Think a Little -- In Fact, the Souvenirs Left by Life That </H5>
Make People Feel Most Solid To See Are the Construction Workers" 
  When the conversation came to Zhang Baifa's most favored old 
trade -- construction, he could not help being exultant, and his 
eyes, which have their own characteristics, became narrow lines, 
as he said happily: "I feel it is very meaningful to have a 
career in construction, I am really delighted to see the 
buildings of various styles in Beijing. Think a little -- in 
fact, the souvenirs left by life that make people feel most 
solid to see are the construction workers." 
  In the West, people call architecture solidified music. 
However, whether in the West or in the East, architecture is a 
sign of human life. 
  In October 1934, Zhang Baifa was born in a peasant household 
in Hebei's Xianghe County. He was a little kid, but he had to 
help his family make a living by cutting wood and weaving. He 
did not go to a primary school until he was 10 years old, and he 
stayed there for a year. In that time, his hometown was a 
guerrilla zone, so when he was in school, he and his family had 
to hide here and there because of the war against the Japanese. 
Later, Japan surrendered and the northeast was liberated, and 
they kept celebrating. Indeed, he did received very little 
education. 
  He said when recalling the events in that period: "When I 
was in the school, my deepest impression was the liberation of 
Jinzhou. The first song we sang in school was `Without the 
Communist Party There Would Be No New China.' In this way, we 
cultivated our plain feeling." 
  In 1948, he was 14 years old, and he walked with his father 
from his hometown to Beiping [old name of Beijing], where they 
became individual operators engaged in the weaving business. 
Every day, day after day, when he opened his eyes, he would 
begin weaving, until he was very tired, then he would collapse 
onto the weaving machine and sleep; life became boring. He 
sighed and said: "In that time, the small business indeed could 
not earn any money, unlike today's individuals who can get rich 
very quickly; the phenomenon we see now is abnormal, and it 
shows that the government has many loopholes for them to get 
through." However, reflecting on the life which tempered him in 
that time, he said humorously: "In that time, I learned some 
technique, and that is, no interference could disrupt my sleep; 
therefore, now, no matter how noisy, I can sleep." 
  In 1949, he returned to his hometown to see his mother, at a 
time when the CPC and the Kuomintang were fighting for control 
of Beiping. When he returned to the capital in 1950, Beijing 
was already controlled by the CPC. He lived in the Gongyuan 
area in the eastern part of Beijing. In those years, untidy 
earth mounds and rubbish heaps could be seen everywhere over 
there, and it was a neighborhood where poor people lived. 
Opposite the big complex where he lived, there was a big 
building under construction, to usher in the three-year period 
of revitalization and construction in Beijing. He was attracted 
by the flames and activities in the construction site, and 
whenever he finished the weaving job, he would try to enter the 
site to play. By coincidence, the workers specializing in 
reinforcing bars in the construction site lived in the complex 
where he lived, so he also learned how to tie up reinforcing 
bars. 
  In 1951, he left the weaving machine and joined the 
construction trade, working as a reinforcing bar worker, and the 
first project he participated in was the three-storey People's 
Bank of China building. Entering the trade, he felt broad and 
independent. In those years, he received no wages, and he 
worked the whole day for eight jin of rice, but he was very 
content. Afterward, he moved to the huts inside construction 
sites, and there he lived for 16 years. 
  He said: "In that time, we basically did not work in the 
winter, during which period we claimed 70 percent of our wages, 
and every day we were organized for studies -- to learn 
politics, `On Contradictions,' and so on. Some well-known 
professors from Beijing University came to give us lectures, and 
we really learned a lot of things." These studies also 
theoretically armed his work in the years to come. 
  Thereafter, he joined the Communist Youth League, and became 
the leader of a small team. Soon after, a banner reading "Zhang 
Baifa's Young Reinforcing-Bar Commandos" was hoisted, and they 
fought here and there in the capital, winning great merits. 
Zhang Baifa and his commandos were commended as model workers 
for 11 consecutive years. He himself was elected a national 
advanced producer in 1956; in 1958 he was elected a deputy to 
the National People's Congress; and in 1959 he was granted a 
meeting with party and state leaders at a get- together party 
for national heroes. His name has been well-known since the 
1950's. 
  In 1965, Zhang Baifa officially took a leading post, serving 
as the deputy manager of the No. 3 Construction Company. He 
moved into his own office. Thereafter, he took the post of 
deputy party secretary of the company. During the Cultural 
Revolution, like other model workers, Zhang Baifa was brought 
down. He was transferred downward to the No. 2 Automobile 
Company in Hubei Province, where he still took charge of housing 
construction. In January 1973, he returned to Beijing. 
Thereafter, he served as the vice minister of the State 
Construction Commission. In 1981, he took the post of vice 
mayor of Beijing, and he has been serving in the post until now. 
  At the request of this reporter, Zhang Baifa talked about 
the 
extraordinary relations he has with several senior leaders. 
  Zhang Baifa's relations with Wan Li were established when 
the 
former was a model worker. He said: "In 1958, Wan Li was 
minister of the State Commission for Urban Construction, and on 
a certain occasion, he granted us a meeting, and I sat just next 
to him. He talked and we took down notes. He turned his head 
to look at my notes, which were written with untidy strokes, so 
he asked me what was my educational attainment, and I said I was 
a boor and illiterate. He criticized me: `Boor, no way! In 
the past you might say you were a boor and be proud of it; 
nowadays it is nothing of which to be proud. Lenin once said 
similar words that boors cannot construct socialism.'" 
  Thereafter, in less than a year, Wan Li took office as vice 
mayor of Beijing, overseeing urban construction. Every year, he 
would send for the representatives of model workers like him for 
conversations. After Zhang Baifa became a cadre, Wan Li said to 
him: "You now have become an official, but if you have the 
thinking of an official then you are wrong. Only a bureaucrat 
will sit in the office, you must act like you did in the past, 
and go often to the grass-roots levels." 
  During the Cultural Revolution, Wan Li was toppled, and Li 
Ruihuan, Zhang Baifa, and Shi Chuanxiang -- the three model 
workers who were much favored by Wan Li -- also were toppled. 
On the eve of 1967, the Beijing Workers Stadium was scheduled 
for a 10,000-person meeting to denounce Wan Li, and Li Ruihuan, 
Zhang Baifa, and Shi Chuanxiang were summoned to the meeting. 
  Zhang Baifa disclosed that afterward, Wan Li still "proudly" 
said: In so many meetings for criticisms and denouncements, I 
am the most honored, for I am accompanied by three worker 
friends, and this shows that I still have the mass. During the 
meeting, Li Ruihuan wrote a couplet to denounce Wan Li: "In the 
past, scent wafted 10,000 miles; at present, stink is left for 
10,000 years." Zhang Baifa added a horizontal scroll: "Starting 
from zero." After the meeting, Wan Li changed Zhang Baifa's 
scroll into "Staging a comeback," to explicitly encourage them 
not to become dejected, but to stage a comeback. Thereafter, 
they really staged a comeback. Unfortunately, one of their 
brothers, Shi Chuanxiang, who was a dung-collecter, passed away 
during the Cultural Revolution. 
  According to information, even now, he and Li Ruihuan will 
go 
to see Wan Li together; and every New Year's Day they will 
jointly visit Shi Chuanxiang's family. 
<H5>  "Even the Best National Banquet Cannot Match a Bowl of Hot </H5>
Noodle Soup. Sometimes, You Must Spend Three Hours at a 
Banquet, and That Is Not Far From a Slow Suicide." 
  Zhang Baifa, a mayor at the vice minister level, is 
naturally 
listed as a senior cadre, though he is different in many ways 
from a senior cadre as envisaged by the people. You can 
perceive this clearly from his body language and from his way of 
talking. The impression he gives people is: Easy-going, 
humorous, frank, and natural, like a commoner who is sincere and 
unrestrained. 
  When this reporter entered his small and simple office, he 
asked his secretary to move a chair to a place in front of his 
desk, and said: "Do not sit on the sofa, sit here, so we are 
equal." Then, he asked in a straightforward manner: "What do 
you want to ask? What do you want to talk about?" 
  Zhang Baifa is capable -- no doubt about it. His energy and 
hard work can be seen from the rapidly developing urban 
construction in Beijing during the years. In those eye-catching 
major projects and the busy construction sites where whole 
stretches of land are under development, one can see his 
silhouette here and there. In addition, on many public 
occasions, one often can see Zhang Baifa playing a special role. 
Being a vice mayor, he can have only a secretary, but because 
his work is really busy, he has been given one more secretary to 
help him. Even so, he is still very busy. During the interview, 
this reporter saw his secretary busily answer a series of phone 
calls, and a queue of people who came to the office. Zhang 
Baifa frankly said that in fact, the job he is doing should be 
done by a younger person because it requires a lot of energy and 
strength. 
  Zhang Baifa can "speak with fervor and assurance," and 
this is known to all. When he starts to speak eloquently, with 
the Beijing accent, he can change the extremely serious and 
official "bureaucratic tone" into an extremely relaxed and 
humorous "people's saying," which can get at things very 
precisely, and is particularly acceptable to the common flock. 
Zhang Baifa dares to "talk freely," and always to let the 
common flock feel as comfortable as if they had spoken the words 
in their hearts. Speaking ideas frankly already has become a 
very peculiar characteristic of this charismatic official. 
Zhang Baifa also admitted that he likes to speak frankly and 
make jokes with various people. 
  The saying goes: It is difficult to serve as an official in 
the capital. How would Zhang Baifa, who has already served as a 
people's official for more than a decade under the watchful eyes 
of the "court," sum up his way of running the government? He 
said frankly: I have reached this age, I can understand things, 
and I do not have any ambitions. In short, I do not struggle 
for dominance and benefits, I am not scared about being honored 
or insulted, and I do things for the people regardless of praise 
or criticism. To put it more straightforward: Accusations, 
complaints, and praises -- I listen to them all; good things, 
difficult things, and stupid things -- I do them all. 
  Zhang Baifa has to attend many social functions, and he has 
had the experience of going to three banquets in one evening. 
It really is too much for him. He said: "Even the best 
national banquet cannot match a bowl of hot noodle soup. 
Sometimes, you must spend three hours at a banquet, and that is 
not far from a slow suicide. No matter what kind of banquet I 
eat, when I return home I must eat some rice or a bowl of 
noodles." Under the current situation, it is not something new 
for officials to attend banquets and "sacrifice." Zhang Baifa 
often eats lunch in his office; he has a pan in his office, and 
a bowl of "Master Fu Quick Noodles" plus some processing can 
easily become a gourmet's meal. 
  Zhang Baifa, who turns 60 this year, said sentimentally when 
talking about the future: "I know every tree and blade of grass 
in Beijing, as well as every nook and cranny; I have feelings 
for them. I have traveled to almost every major city in the 
world to learn their architectural features, but eventually I 
still feel nowhere is better than China. I should have retired 
by now; I will be 63 when I complete this term of office. My 
goals during this term are: Thoroughly improve the environment 
along Changan Avenue, thoroughly improve the environment along 
the second loop, improve the environment along a section of the 
third loop, and solve problems for the 200,000 households whose 
average living space is four square meters. The construction of 
the Beijing International Airport; the Beijing West Passenger 
Station, which has an investment of 4.2 billion yuan; and the 
project of channeling natural gas from the northwest to Beijing 
have to be completed. Regrettably, the project of diverting 
water from the south to the north cannot be completed during my 
term of office, for it can only be completed by 2000, but I 
still will be able to see it. If all these things can be done, 
I will die content."

<F P=106> [Report: "Brief Biographies of the Spokesmen of Some </F>
Ministries and Commissions of the State Council"] 
  [Text] [ZHONGGUO JIZHE editor's note] At present, through 
various news media, the spokesmen of various central departments 
have been explaining various central policies and answering 
various questions that the masses are concerned about. Such 
news briefings are of high authoritativeness. The "spokesmen" 
are playing more and more important roles. In order to better 
serve journalistic work, we will introduce the spokesmen of 
various central departments, and will also listen to their 
opinions about the news media and journalists. 
  Following replies to the questionaires, this issue first 
introduces six spokesmen. In the future, we will introduce 
more, and will also discuss the work of the "media spokesmen." 
[end editor's note] 
  Ding Junfa, spokesman for the Ministry of Domestic Trade: 
  Male, born in February 1940, Nan nationality. My native 
place is Zhangjiagang City of Jiangsu Province. I graduated 
from Chinese People's University in 1964, then worked and 
studied in France. I worked with the First Machine-Building 
Industry Ministry between 1969 and 1988, and successively took 
the posts of officer of the Foreign Affairs Bureau, secretary in 
the Minister's Office, responsible person of the General Office, 
executive deputy president of Hefei Industry University, deputy 
chief of the Education Bureau, and party committee secretary of 
the Development Planning Research Institute. Between 1988 and 
1993, I worked as director of the Science and Education 
Department of the Ministry of Materials, director of the Supply 
Management Department, and director of the General Office. My 
works included "Where Is the Road" and "Introduction of 
Socialist Education." 
  In 1993, I was appointed director of the General Office of 
the Ministry of Domestic Trade, and became spokesman for the 
ministry. My main task is to announce to the domestic and 
overseas press major policies in the realm of commodity 
circulation, major reform measures and developments in this 
realm, and major information in the commodity market. I 
sincerely hope to closely cooperate with the news media in order 
more effectively to spread information related to commodity 
circulation. This will play an important role in promoting the 
healthy development of the market system and in guiding 
industrial and agricultural production.

General Office of the State Council, successively being section 
chief and deputy bureau chief in charge of the economic work

the situation of our foreign trade, economic cooperation, and 
using foreign funds, as well as the situation in and development 
of bilateral and multilateral economic and trade relations 
between our country and other countries and regions. I also

information on various topics to major news institutions at 
home. In order to keep abreast of the latest developments and 
to better play the part, I have to read a large quantity of 
documents and materials every day. 
  I hope that the news institutions will give great support to 
our work and more publicity to the rapid development of our 
country's foreign trade and foreign economic activities and also 
the important role of these things in our country's reform and 
opening. I look forward to closer ties and cooperation with you.

nothing of hardships in your unceasingly diligent work, and also 
absorb a lot of nutrition from your work. From your reports, I 
may obtain information, increase knowledge, and realize 
self-enhancement. I express my heartfelt thanks to my friends 
in the press. I also hope that science and technology will hold 
a greater proportion in journalism and propaganda as a whole and

  [Text] Nanjing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Wang Yangzu, deputy 
director of the State Bureau of Environmental Protection, said 
that the Chinese Government will take measures to prevent 
hazardous waste materials from being shipped from overseas into 
its territory. 
  Wang expressed the Chinese Government's stance against 
importing wastes at a conference in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu 
Province, Saturday [11 June] to commend Nanjing port for its 
discovery and return of harmful chemical wastes to Republic of 
Korea. 
  On September 25, 1993, two Chinese corporations and some 
companies of the Republic of Korea had 1,288 tons of harmful 
chemical wastes shipped to Nanjing port under the label "other 
fuel oil". 
  The matter caught the attention of the State Council and 
through joint efforts of departments involved, on March 5, the 
wastes were all returned to the port of origin abroad. 
  Experts noted that in recent years, the cases of 
transnational transferring of harmful wastes and rubbish were on 
the increase. 
  The State Bureau of Environmental Protection and General 
Administration of Customs are now closely cooperating to prevent 
pollutants from abroad from being shipped into China. 
  China is now formulating a law governing solid waste 
pollution.

  [Text] It was not the lack of legislation but strong 
resistance from government and party officials that has hindered 
the development of unions in Hong Kong and Taiwan-funded 
factories in China's southern provinces, a local unionist said. 
Apo Leung, researcher at the Trade Union Education Centre in 
Hong Kong, pointed out that unionisation had met with tremendous 
difficulties in these factories most of which had only very 
short-term investment plans in China. "It's not a matter of 
law. Resistance from government and party authorities [against 
unions] has been strong because they are afraid that unions will 
scare off investors," Mr Leung said. 
  Aside from official resistance, the unionist said that 
workers' high mobility was also a factor behind the low rate of 
unionisation in these factories. During the past decade, Hong 
Kong and Taiwan investors have been pouring into China, with the 
bulk in the Pearl River Delta region. Rough estimates show that 
these industries now employ five million to 10 million migrant 
workers. "It's difficult to organise them. And the bosses hold 
enormous authority," Mr Leung said. 
  Not only were these workers unaware of the concept of trade 
unions and their rights to organise, they were also 
discriminated against by official unionists, he said. Some 
workers had no idea what unions were while others believed 
unions were just welfare and recreational clubs, Mr Leung said, 
recounting his experi ence with migrant workersin Shenzhen. But 
even when individval unions were set up in these factories, he 
argued, "they are just window dressing... serving to control 
rather than protect workers' interests". In China, all unions, 
in state or foreign-funded enterprises, come under the auspices 
of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. "It's an 
administrative measure all the way down, a control mechanism," 
Mr Leung said. 
  During the past year, China has called for the unionisation 
of all foreign-owned enterprises in view of their worsening 
safety records and the increasing number of labour disputes. Mr 
Leung suggested that it was a means to dominate and suppress any 
independent move by workers. He noted that some preliminary 
groupings, though not well organised, had recently emerged 
mostly among migrant workers. 
  The unionist, however, suggested that there existed 
possibilities for change, even within government sanctioned 
unions, since some union members were elected from workers, 
particularly in joint ventures. "And workers in these 
enterprises are more aggressive, daring and eager to learn [than 
those from state enterprises]. These are favourable elements," 
he said. There were also some liberal-minded union federation 
cadres, Mr Leung said. "They supported the autonomous workers' 
movement in 1989. And some of them are still active in cadre 
training and theoretical studies."

<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Junior Civil Servants To Be Hired on Merit"] </F>
  [Text] Lower-ranking civil servants are to be hired based 
on their ability, the Ministry of Personnel has announced. 
  The ministry issued regulations yesterday requiring new 
staff 
below the level of section chief to be taken on the basis of 
exam results. 
  However, the new rule which is immediately enforceable, is 
not applicable to senior civil servants. They will continue to 
be appointed by the higher authorities. 
  The aim of the new selection procedure is to select the most 
able candidate for the government job, through fairness, 
equality and competition, said Vice-Minister of Personnel Cheng 
Lianchang. 
  The new members of staff will be recruited according to the 
Provisional Regulations on the Employment of Civil Servants. 
The selection procedure of civil servants has been under 
discussion since 1988. The new regulations have been outlined 
in nine chapters and 39 clauses. 
  Since 1949, most government staff have been selected from 
college graduates or retired officers. 
  But this method of recruitment has failed to meet the needs 
of the market economy, under which government administration 
should be handled by professionals on an open basis, said Cheng. 
  The competitive recruitment system was first tested in 1989 
when 144 civil servants were selected from 1,334 applicants on 
the basis of their exam results. They were employed by the 
Ministry of Personnel and six other ministries. 
  Since then, 63 departments from the State Council have 
recruited 716 State employees from 11,611 applicants in the same 
way. 
  And in the past four years, 29 provinces, municipalities and 
autonomous regions have employed 71,000 government employees 
from 470,000 people on the basis of exam results. 
  This method of selection has laid the foundation for the 
implementation of the new recruitment code and the civil servant 
system, said Cheng. 
  And the Ministry of Personnel hopes to have established the 
new recruitment scheme within the next three years candidates 
for civil servant posts have to sit a written and oral exam on 
topics including political science, law, administrative 
management and the handling of official documents. 
  Those who are selected will be put on probation for a year. 
  Applicants must be citizens below 35. Prison inmates who 
have been deprived of their political rights will not be 
eligible.

<F P=106> [By Zheng Hangsheng (6774 2635 3932): "Thoughts on Mode of </F>
Current Cultural Development"] 
  [Text] At present, China's society is going through a 
period in which the change from a traditional society to a 
modern society is being accelerated. A prominent expression of 
a period in which the society is changing from one type to 
another is that the ideology is lively and various ideas tend to 
be very complicated. This is more so in a period in which the 
change from one type of society into another is being 
accelerated. We can see the ideological tendency of enriching 
and developing the original theories, newly emerged ideological 
tendencies, newly introduced ideological tendencies, the 
ideological tendency of reviving old ideas under new pretenses, 
the tendency of mixing up different kinds of ideas in different 
ways, and so on. Sociology mainly analyzes the ideological and 
cultural phenomena of the society and their influence on the 
operation of the society from the angle of the society's 
mainstream culture, subculture, and counter culture. 
  The phenomena of the three kinds of culture, the mainstream 
culture, subculture, and counter culture, exist in all 
societies. However, different societies handle these three kinds 
of culture differently. If the relationship between these three 
kinds of culture is handled properly, the benign operation and 
coordinated development of the society will be promoted; if it 
is not properly handled, the society will operate in a neutral 
manner, its development will be obscured, and it may even fall 
into malign operation or lopsided development. Therefore, 
correctly handling the relationship between these three kinds of 
culture is very important to any society. This is also true of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and is a 
particularly urgent task in China's society today when the 
change from one type of society to another is being accelerated. 
  Mainstream culture is the culture which occupies a 
ruling or guiding position in a society. The mainstream culture 
of China's society today is nothing but the socialist culture 
with Chinese characteristics which takes Marxism as its 
guidance, absorbs the fine cultural heritage of the Chinese 
nation and of the world, and serves the people. The main melody 
of the times in China today comprises socialist theories with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism; the creative spirit of the masses 
of the people in reform, opening up, and modernization; and the 
traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. This mainstream 
culture and main melody are where the fundamental values of our 
country lie. They are the sources of the powerful cohesive 
force of our country's society; the spiritual factors ensuring 
and promoting the socialist social and economic development, 
political stability, social progress, and nationality 
consolidation; and they are also an inspiring force ensuring and 
promoting the smooth progress of the change from one type of 
society into the other and the success of modernization. 
Therefore, how to handle the mainstream culture and the main 
melody is not a dispensable or minor issue but, to a certain 
extent, it can be said to be a major issue which has a bearing 
on the future and destiny of our country. A society which has 
lost its mainstream culture is like a body without a backbone 
and is unable to stand a storm. We should soberly understand 
that the diversification in social life and the complicated 
ideological tendencies that follow in the period in which the 
society changes from one type to another provide both an 
opportunity and a challenge to the development of the mainstream 
culture and the main melody. Besides, only the victor of the 
challenge can talk about opportunity. 
  The diversification in social life in the period in which 
the 
society changes from one type into another has also provided 
conditions and motive force for the rise and diversification of 
the subculture. The increasing diversification of the 
subculture is one of the conspicuous characteristics in the 
period in which the change of the society from one type into 
another is accelerated and it is also an unavoidable tendency. 
Generally speaking, the diversification of the subculture is 
conducive to the development and progress of the society and is 
something good. It shows that a society is full of vitality and 
vigor. The participants [cheng dan zhe 2110 2137 5074] in 
subculture are large numbers of colonies and small colonies 
formed as a result of differences in nationality, class, 
stratum, occupation, region, sex, age, and so on. In the period 
in which the society change from one type into another, because 
of the emergence of various new occupations and the intensified 
social division and social mobility, the number of colonies and 
small colonies also increases rapidly. On the one hand, they 
belong to major colonies represented by the mainstream culture 
and are governed by the mainstream culture to varying degrees. 
On the other hand, they also have culture which expresses their 
unique concepts, codes of conduct, and interests, that is, the 
subculture or secondary culture. The overwhelming part of 
the subculture has the same direction as that of the mainstream 
culture and is conducive to safeguarding and improving the 
existing social order. This part of the subculture is not 
excluded, but encouraged and propped up, by the mainstream 
culture and is sometimes absorbed as part of the latter. 
Therefore, generally speaking, if proper guidance is given, 
diversification of the subculture is something good. 
  Under what conditions then is the subculture harmful to the 
mainstream culture? There are mainly two conditions: First, 
the diversification of the subculture has obscured and even 
submerged the mainstream culture; second, the diversification of 
the subculture has induced a malign inflation of the counter 
culture which is harmful to social progress. Therefore, at 
present, when the mainstream culture is being challenged and is 
faced with the increasing diversification of the subculture, it 
is all the more necessary to emphasize the mainstream culture. 
This tells us that in the face of diversification, we cannot 
forget centralization; of course, conversely, in emphasizing 
centralization, we cannot forget diversification either. 
  The diversification of social life in a period in which 
the society is changing from one type to another has, at the 
same time, left space and room for the generation and unchecked 
spreading of counter culture. Counter culture is that 
kind of subculture which negates and deviates from the 
mainstream culture. It is necessary to carry out specific 
analysis on the role of counter culture under different 
historical conditions. In class societies before the 
socialist society, some counter culture which deviated from and 
negated the mainstream culture of the reactionary ruling classes 
might have a certain progressive significance and the counter 
culture of the advanced classes often represented a kind of new 
social culture. Generally speaking, in the socialist society, 
counter culture is harmful to the stability and development of 
the socialist society. Counter culture has different forms and 
the degree of their harmfulness to the society also varies. 
Some do harm to a part or parts of the society while others do 
harm to the overall situation. Of course, we cannot overlook 
either of these. The purpose of negating and deviating from the 
mainstream culture of counter culture which does harm to the 
overall situation is to replace the mainstream culture. 
Challenges to the mainstream culture mainly come from this kind 
of counter culture. 
  According to the abovementioned, during a period in 
which the society is changing from one type to another, 
particularly when this change is accelerated, the question of 
what cultural mode should be practiced is clear. This is to 
say: The mainstream culture must have a clear-cut stand, 
subculture must be diversified, and counter culture must be 
brought under control. Sociological studies in light of 
China's reality have also shown us the same truth. It should be 
pointed out that over quite a long period, "insufficiencies" in 
three aspects have evidently existed in handling the 
relationship between the three kinds of culture, that is, the 
emphasis on the mainstream culture has been insufficient, the 
guidance given to the subculture has been insufficient, and the 
resistance to the counter culture has been insufficient. This 
has brought about negative influences on various aspects of 
social life, on the healthy development of reform and opening 
up, and on the building of spiritual civilization. Therefore, 
it is very important to increase our understanding of, and to 
reach a consensus on, the cultural mode mentioned above. 
  That "the mainstream culture must have a clear-cut 
stand" means the mainstream culture must emphasize its own 
existence and express, in a clear-cut manner, what it advocates, 
permits, restricts, and opposes. It must stand firm before 
major issues of principle and should not disregard what is wrong 
and what violates the law. Things which spread the idea of 
negating party leadership and the socialist system, spread 
decadent ideas and sentiments, disseminate superstition, and 
play up pornography and violence are harmful to our cause and to 
the physical and mental health of the people, particularly 
children and teenagers, and are divorced from the broad masses 
of the people and cannot be allowed to spread unchecked. What 
does it mean by "arming the people with scientific theories, 
guiding them with correct public opinion, portraying people in a 
noble spirit, and encouraging the people with fine works"? 
Viewed from the angle of sociology, this means arming, guiding, 
portraying, and encouraging people with the mainstream culture 
and main melody. The reason why the mainstream culture can play 
such a role is that the overwhelming majority of the members of 
society look for their own standards for judging what is true, 
good, and beautiful and what is false, ugly, and evil from the 
mainstream culture and from various aspects of it, such as 
culture for standardization, culture for appreciation of the 
beautiful, and culture of knowledge. The mainstream culture has 
an extremely great influence on the overwhelming majority of 
members of the society in their formation and selection of their 
fundamental value standards, codes of conduct, and ways of 
thinking. If the mainstream culture of a society is ambiguous 
or weakened, the members of the society will not know what 
course to take and will have a sense of loss and the society 
will be out of control. What does it mean to avoid the tendency 
to stress material progress at the expense of cultural and 
ideological progress? Viewed from the point of sociology, this 
mainly means stressing material progress at the expense of the 
mainstream culture and the main melody. Therefore, these are 
different ways of stressing the mainstream culture and the main 
melody. 
  Regarding the necessity for diversified subculture in the 
mode that "the mainstream culture must have a clear-cut stand, 
the subculture must be diversified, and the counter culture must 
be brought under control," I do not think many people have 
different views and, regarding the necessity of bringing counter 
culture under control, not too many people have different views 
either because the harm to the operation of the society from the 
counter culture in criminal establishments and the pornography 
industry, and among drug traffickers and drug addicts, is known 
to all. However, regarding the necessity for the mainstream 
culture to have a clear-cut stand, the situation is different. 
Views differ greatly regarding whether or not the mainstream 
culture is needed, what kind of mainstream is needed, and 
whether or not the mainstream should have a clear-cut stand. 
Some people have always, consciously or unconsciously, negated 
and obscured our socialist mainstream culture in one way or 
another. 
  For example, one viewpoint holds that "China's official 
ideology" -- actually meaning the mainstream culture in Chinese 
society--is undergoing the process of "fading out or weakening" 
and stresses that the tendency of this process of the "fading 
out or weakening of ideology" has become the "guiding 
development direction" since reform and opening started. 
Obviously, the so-called process of the "fading out or 
weakening of ideology" is in reality another expression of the 
"fading out of the mainstream culture or weakening of the 
mainstream culture." According to this view, the tendency of 
the "fading out or weakening of ideology" will continue to be 
the "guiding development direction." 
  For some time, terms like "weakening" and "fading out of 
ideology" seem to have been in fashion and popular. Advocated 
and publicized by some people at home and abroad, it seems as if 
the process of the "weakening of ideology" and that of the 
"fading out of ideology" in China has become a self-evident fact 
and he who does not agree with it is "rigid." As a matter of 
fact, neither of these conforms with facts or is exact. Some 
people have very inappropriately classed our party's eradicating 
past "leftist" mistakes and shattering the fetters of "taking 
class struggle as the key link" as the "weakening of ideology" 
and have classed the process of shifting social life on to the 
orbit of taking economic construction as the center as the 
"fading out of ideology." In fact, it is quite understandable 
for some Western politicians and propagandists to put it that 
way because they have always held biased and even hostile views 
on the socialist system, the leadership of the CPC, and the four 
cardinal principles stipulated in the Constitution. This is 
determined by the characters of their bourgeois parties and by 
the stand, viewpoints, and methods of the bourgeoisie. What 
makes it difficult to understand is that some people who are 
especially engaged in sociological scientific research have 
followed their example and said similar things. At the very 
least they are not sober-headed. As a matter of fact, all 
countries have their own ideology and there is no country which 
does not have ideology. It is impossible for all ideology to 
"fade out" and the essence of the question is what kind of 
ideology should "fade out." Are countries in which the call for 
the "fading out of ideology" is the loudest not energetically 
and wantonly imposing their own ideology on to other countries 
in the world today? In those countries, the so-called "fading 
out of ideology" was quite hypocritical at the very beginning 
and its aim is to swallow up our ideology and to replace our 
ideology with theirs. The issue is very clear. In our country, 
the so-called "fading out of ideology" simply does not exist. 
The only issue which exists is that of emancipating the mind, 
seeking truth from facts, and eliminating erroneous ideas which 
are not in conformity with the party's basic line. Evidently, 
instead of being an issue of the "fading out of ideology" it is 
precisely an issue of making ideology in China which is guided 
by Marxism, conforms better with reality, and is more 
scientific. Likewise, the so-called "weakening of ideology" 
simply does not exist in China either. The only issue which 
exists is that of adopting various measures to earnestly 
strengthen the ideology in China. After various erroneous ideas 
which do not conform with "one center, two basic points" are 
eliminated, the ideology in China will become more scientific 
and will be strengthened. The resolution by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pointed out that we 
should study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the 
study on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, strengthen the study on philosophy 
and social sciences guided by Marxism, and we should 
energetically advocate, under the condition of a socialist 
market economy, upholding a correct view of life and civilized 
and healthy ways of living and opposing money worship, extreme 
individualism, decadent life-styles, and so on. Where can one 
find any traces of the "fading out of ideology" or the 
"weakening of ideology" here? Therefore, such a viewpoint, which 
is apparently right but actually wrong, is untenable. 
  Another viewpoint, for example, which can be called the 
theory of "dividing the country into three," holds that in China 
today the official ideology, the Western instrumental [gong ju 
1562 0367] rationalism, and the traditional Chinese culture have 
maintained "a set-up of dividing the country into three" and 
stresses that "it is impossible for any of them to unify the 
whole country." It is very clear that according to this view, 
the three kinds of culture are on an equal footing, none is 
primary or secondary and they have divided the entire culture 
into three. First of all, the mainstream culture, which plays a 
guiding role universally to our society and infiltrates all 
parts of it (in this sense, it "unifies the whole country"), can 
no longer be seen and has disappeared. As a matter of fact, 
the mainstream culture of our society today, that is, the 
socialist culture with Chinese characteristics which takes 
Marxism as its guidance, absorbs the fine cultural heritage of 
the Chinese nation and the world and serves the people, as 
mentioned above, is a unity of centralization and 
diversification: Centralization in ideological 
guidance--guidance of Marxism; diversification in cultural 
forms, cultural streams and schools, and academic 
views--therefore, it is necessary to let a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Here, it 
is necessary to guard against two tendencies: One is 
centralization excluding diversification and the other is 
diversification excluding centralization. Both tendencies are 
one-sided. The viewpoint of the theory of "dividing the country 
into three" is a kind of one-sidedness which leads to 
diversification excluding centralization. Second, according to 
this view, the correct relationship between these three kinds of 
culture cannot be seen either. Undoubtedly, the issue of using 
foreign culture for reference, including Western culture, and 
the issue of inheriting the Chinese traditional culture are 
involved. Of course, we should pay attention to reference and 
inheritance because our mainstream culture should be an open 
culture enriched with the fruits of human civilization, 
including the absorption of the most valuable achievements made 
in the era of capitalism. However, the purpose of paying 
attention to reference and inheritance is to organically 
integrate, through reference and inheritance, the cream of the 
traditional culture of our nation and of foreign culture with 
the fine traditions and revolutionary spirit formed in the 
course of revolution and construction carried out by the people 
under the leadership of our party over a long period of time. 
On this basis, we should constantly blaze new trails in 
building and developing the socialist culture with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  In short, to develop the socialist market economy in a 
healthy and coordinated manner; to correctly handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability; to 
build the spiritual civilization while building the material 
civilization; and to adhere to the principle of "grasping with 
both hands" and "grasping firmly with both hands," we must 
uphold and develop our mainstream culture and main melody, give 
correct guidance to the diversified subculture, prevent various 
kinds of counter culture from spreading unchecked, and minimize 
the harm caused by counter culture. This is exactly an attitude 
of seeking truth from facts in correctly dealing with social 
cultural phenomena.

<F P=106> [By Wei Jianxing (1414 0256 5887): "It Is Necessary To </F>
Wholeheartedly Rely on the Working Class in Reform, Development, 
and Stability"] 
  [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress has put forward the 
goal of reform to build the system of a socialist market economy 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress 
has adopted the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee on Some 
Questions Concerning the Building of the System of a Socialist 
Market Economy," symbolizing that China's economic structural 
reform has entered a stage of storming fortifications and in 
which all-out advance and major breakthroughs are integrated. 
This year is a crucial year for China to accelerate building 
the new economic system and carry out comprehensive and in-depth 
reform. With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line as guidance, the whole country is implementing the spirit 
of the 14th CPC Congress and its Third Plenary Session in an 
overall manner and various jobs are vigorously developing 
closely around the center of the basic principles of the party 
and the state for the work this year, they are also 
conscientiously obeying and serving the overall situation of 
"grasping the opportune moment, carrying out in-depth reform, 
expanding opening-up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability." As the leading class in the state, and the 
representative of advanced productive forces and relations of 
production, the working class takes an extremely important 
position in reform, development, and stability. It is of 
extremely important significance at present and in the future to 
rely wholeheartedly on the working class and handle well the 
relations of reform, development, and stability. 
<H8>  I. </H8>
  At present, China enjoys economic development, political 
stability, national unity, and social progress. Various 
undertakings are full of vitality and the situation is 
favorable. The international situation as a whole is favorable 
to China's development. The better the situation, the more we 
should grasp the opportune moment, make good use of it, keep 
sober-minded, and fully see the challenges we face and the 
existing problems. We should be prepared for danger in times of 
peace, work more conscientiously, strive to develop ourselves, 
and promote the overall development of the building of two 
civilizations. More than 10 years of practice in China's reform 
and construction have told us that reform is the motive force, 
development is the purpose, and stability is the guarantee. We 
must rely wholeheartedly on the working class to handle well the 
relations between reform, development, and stability, enabling 
them to promote each other and develop in a coordinated way. If 
we give up relying on the working class, we cannot talk about 
achieving anything. 
  Reform is the cause of the working class and the masses of 
the people themselves. The Chinese working class has displayed 
extremely great political enthusiasm in reform and has always 
stood in the forefront of reform, the road to a powerful nation, 
with a high sense of responsibility of being the master of its 
own affairs. It has the cardinal principles in mind and takes 
the overall situation into account, actively supporting the 
introduction of various reform measures. It takes part in and 
promotes various reforms of its own accord and the brilliant 
achievements it has made has gone down in history forever. 
According to an investigation by the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions on the situation regarding the working class 
contingent, the broad masses of staff and workers have made fine 
appraisals of the achievements in reform for more than 10 years 
in China, positively supporting and favoring further in-depth 
reform and expansion of opening-up. When their interests become 
involved in some reforms, the broad masses of staff and workers 
say that as long as it is favorable to the overall situation of 
reforms, and as long as they can bear it economically, they will 
support the reforms resolutely. The correct understanding and 
treatment of various new things and new issues which emerge in 
reform displayed by the broad masses of staff and workers, the 
spirit of being the master of one's own affairs and of daring to 
meet difficulties head-on, and the style and features of the 
times of being bold in dedication and creation, have effectively 
ensured the smooth progress of reform. The working class has 
proved by its own practical actions that it is the master and 
the subject of reform and that it is worthy of its powerful 
motivational force. Today, as we are carrying out in-depth 
reform, it is an extremely important task for the whole party 
and the whole society to bring into better play this powerful 
motivational force. 
  The working class is the main force that promotes China's 
economic development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: 
Grasp the opportune moment, develop ourselves, and the crux is 
to develop the economy. Development is a tough argument, is the 
overall situation, and the crux. During various periods of the 
Chinese revolution and construction, the working class have made 
huge contributions to national emancipation and to making China 
prosperous and strong. Under the new situation of reform and 
opening-up and modernization, the working class has again 
performed immortal deeds promoting the building of the socialist 
material civilization and spiritual civilization. Labor 
creation by staff and workers trhoughout China accounts for 
about 70 percent of the GNP and over 90 percent of state 
revenue. Facing the market and basing themselves on their own 
jobs, the broad masses of staff and workers have made remarkable 
achievements in developing new products, raising product 
quality, concentrating their efforts on constant improvement of 
labor productivity and economic performance, and pushing to the 
market sphere the socialist labor emulation drive, 
rationalization proposals, invention and creation, technological 
innovation, technological coordination, and other activities. 
The huge achievements made in China's economic development are 
an embodiment of the industriousness, wisdom, and sweat of the 
working class whose main force role in the socialist 
modernization program has been fully displayed. The working 
class uses its own advanced ideas to influence and nurture the 
whole society and promotes the building of the socialist 
spiritual civilization. Its extensive impact and leading force 
is self-evident. To maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy all the more calls for the 
protection, guidance, and mobilization of the main and leading 
force. 
  The working class is the mainstay in safeguarding social 
stability. The importance of social political stability lies in 
the stability of the working class contingent, which is the 
premise and basis of social stability. The working class in 
China greatly treasures the political situation of stability and 
unity. Whether in the face of complex social contradictions, or 
under a changeable international situation, it always rallies 
closely round the party Central Committee. It not only 
maintains the stability of its contingent but also makes huge 
efforts to maintain social political stability, thus vigorously 
safeguarding social political stability. In-depth reform, 
expansion of opening-up, and promotion of development must be 
carried out in a stable social political environment. "The 
working class can be relied upon." Consolidate and develop the 
political situation of stability and unity by relying on the 
working class, try to accomplish promotion of reform and 
development amidst stability and ensure long-term social 
stability by reform and development. These are the requirements 
of the times and also the historical responsibilities of the 
working class. 
  The nature of our party and the state, and the historical 
task of reform, development, and stability, determine that we 
must at all times and under any circumstances uphold, 
unswervingly and with a clear-cut stand, the party's fundamental 
guiding principle of relying wholeheartedly on the working 
class. The nature of a country depends on what position the 
people of that country take and what kind of relationship exists 
between man and man. Our party is the vanguard of the working 
class and the working class is the class basis of our party; 
ours is a socialist country of a people's democratic 
dictatorship, led by the working class and with worker-peasant 
alliance as the basis, and the working class is the leading 
class of the state. Only under the party's leadership can the 
working class achieve its historical mission and only by closely 
relying on the working class can the party consolidate and 
strengthen its leading position and lead the people of the whole 
country in striving to achieve the great cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The difficulty in 
developing a socialist market economy lies in how to link and 
integrate closely the market economy with the basic system of 
socialism. This is an unprecedented great cause, without 
existing experience, which can be utilized. It is required to be 
daring in exploration, bold in practice, and constant in 
innovation under the leadership of the party Central Committee 
by relying wholeheartedly on the working class and the masses of 
the people. In this historical process, the inevitable trend is 
that socialist public ownership occupies a leading position, 
with joint development of diversified economic sectors. To 
each, according to his labor, will be the major form and 
multiple forms of distribution to co-exist over a long period of 
time with some areas; some people will be allowed to become rich 
first and finally achieve common prosperity. The state controls 
the power to carry out effective macroeconomic regulation and 
control over the national economy as a whole. Therefore, in the 
course of developing a socialist market economy, China's 
socialist system remains unchanged, the nature of the state 
remains unchanged, the working class being the leading class of 
the state remains unchanged, the working class being the class 
basis of the party remains unchanged, and the working class, as 
the master of its own affairs, remains unchanged. The subjects 
of a socialist market economy are enterprises and the subjects 
of enterprises are staff and workers. Market is the external 
motive force for enterprise development and the initiatives, 
wisdom, and creativity of staff and workers are sources of 
enterprise vitality. That is to say, the extent to which the 
initiatives of the working class are given play directly affects 
the success or failure of reform and opening-up and the extent 
to which productive forces are emancipated and developed, having 
a bearing on the fate of a socialist market economy. Therefore, 
to develop a socialist market economy, we must attach great 
importance to relying on the masses of staff and workers and 
fully mobilize their initiatives, with which to push forward 
reform, promote development, and safeguard stability. This is 
both the requirement by the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability, as well as the essence and 
superiority of the socialist system. 
<H8>  II. </H8>
  In the overall situation of reform, development, and 
stability, how to rely wholeheartedly on the working class is a 
question which is highly theoretical and practical, with a 
strong policy nature. It is also a hot issue about which the 
broad masses of staff and workers are concerned. In this 
respect, we have many laws, legal regulations, and policies to 
serve as a basis, and also many successful practices and 
experiences which we may use for reference and study. At 
present, we should lay special emphasis on the issues in the 
following aspects: 
  First, we must start by grasping understanding, and 
further heighten understanding, of the importance of relying 
wholeheartedly on the working class. Whom to rely on is a 
matter of the first importance for the revolution and 
construction and is also a matter of the first importance for 
reform, development, and stability. Not everyone understands 
this clearly. Needless to say, with the development of the 
situation, many new circumstances and new problems have appeared 
which merit our attention concerning whom to rely on to carry 
out in-depth reform, promote development, and maintain 
stability. Therefore, on this matter, we must first overcome 
the problem of understanding, especially the problem of 
understanding on the part of the party and government leading 
cadres. We should understand the extreme importance of relying 
wholeheartedly on the working class from the height of 
safeguarding the nature of the party, safeguarding China's state 
system and government system, and implementing the party's 
fundamental guiding principles. It is necessary to propagate 
extensively, through multiple forms and channels, the advanced 
ideas of the working class, its fine quality, and the great 
achievements and huge contributions it has made, and strive to 
build up in the whole society a powerful public opinion and 
strong atmosphere of respecting and relying on the working 
class. 

    In view of the fact that many comrades among leading cadres 
have taken up new leading posts,ng leading cadres have taken up 
new leading posts, and that they are not adequately familiar 
with the party's mass work and mass line, it is required that 
party organizations at various levels carry out re-education on 
relying on the working class and the mass line among party 
cadres, especially among young leading cadres. In party 
schools, administrative cadre schools, and in the teaching of 
cadre training, we should add courses about the working class, 
the workers' movement, and the party's mass work according to 
the requirements by the CPC Central Committee "Circular on 
Strengthening and Improving Party Leadership Over the Work of 
Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's 
Federation," to lay a favorable ideological foundation for 
ensuring the implementation of this fundamental guiding 
principle. 
  Second, we must fully embody and safeguard the status 
of staff and workers of being the masters of their own affairs 
in labor legislation and reform measures. The party's 
fundamental guiding principle of relying wholeheartedly on the 
working class must be fully embodied in labor legislation, 
economic laws and regulations, and reform measures. Otherwise, 
relying on the working class would be an empty phrase. China's 
labor laws and regulations are unsound and are far from meeting 
the requirements for regulating the ever complicated labor 
relations in the transformation to a socialist market economy. 
We should work out as soon as possible the "Labor Law," "Social 
Insurance Law," "Labor Protection law," "Labor Contract Law," 
"Work Hours Law," and a number of other important laws and 
regulation. Before the introduction of these important laws and 
regulation, policies, and measures involving the vital interests 
of staff and workers, we should fully listen to the opinions and 
proposals of the broad masses of staff and workers through 
various channels and forms, so that laws and regulations, 
policies, and measures are built on a profound mass basis. It 
is necessary to ensure, through labor regulations and reform 
measures, that the broad masses of staff and workers constantly 
raise, with economic development, their material and cultural 
levels and living standards, constantly improve labor conditions 
and working environments, constantly create opportunities for 
occupational training, enter decisionmaking bodies more 
effectively, and participate in the management of the affairs of 
the state, and also social and economic affairs. At present, it 
is especially necessary to strengthen mass supervision over law 
enforcement and to build a mechanism for effective mass 
supervision. Party and government departments at various levels 
should accept of their own accord the supervision by staff and 
workers and the broad masses of the people, thus placing various 
jobs under supervision by the masses. Leading cadres should 
constantly go deep among the masses, go down to the grass-roots 
units, care for the suffering of staff and workers, listen to 
the voice of the masses, and take the "first signal" from the 
masses of staff and workers as a major basis for decisionmaking. 
In various reforms involving the vital interests of staff and 
workers, it is necessary to uphold the principles that 
decisionmaking is scientific and democratic, that staff and 
workers as a whole are benefited, that the overall bearing 
capacity of staff and workers should be taken into full account, 
and that the basic living standards of staff and workers is 
ensured. This is both the requirement that "reform is for the 
people" and also the specific embodiment of relying 
wholeheartedly on the working class. 
  Third, we must rely on staff and workers to transform 
state-owned enterprise operational mechanisms and promote the 
building of a modern enterprise system, so that the status and 
the right of staff and workers to be the masters of their own 
affairs will be conscientiously implemented in enterprises. 
The transformation of state-owned enterprise operational 
mechanisms, in particular the building of a modern enterprise 
system, is an innovation of the socialist enterprise system and 
is an inevitable requirement for big socialized production and 
the development of a socialist market economy. One of the 
important features of a modern enterprise system with Chinese 
characteristics is to build a scientific enterprise leadership 
system and organizational and management system. State-owned 
enterprise mechanism transformation and system building did not, 
and will not, change the status of staff and workers of being 
the masters of their own affairs in enterprises. When staff and 
workers lose their status of being the masters of their own 
affairs in enterprises, enterprises lose their socialist nature. 
To uphold and improve the democratic management system with 
staff and workers representative conferences as the basic form, 
and to constantly explore new forms of realizing staff and 
workers democratic management and democratic supervision, are 
important contents of relying on staff and workers for mechanism 
transformation and system building and are the essential 
property of socialist enterprises. 
  This year, departments concerned in the State Council will 
organize a number of large and medium state-owned enterprises to 
make experiments on building a modern enterprise system 
according to the requirements of the "Corporations Law" to 
explore the effective ways of integrating public ownership with 
market economy to further emancipate and develop the productive 
forces. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress 
clearly pointed out: "Trade unions and staff and workers 
representative conferences should organize staff and workers to 
take part in enterprise democratic management and safeguard 
their legitimate rights and interests. Therefore, state-owned 
and collective enterprises, whether they practise a 
contract-based system or a shareholding system, or enterprise 
groups carrying out corporation transformation and development, 
must carry out staff and workers democratic management. 
According to the stipulations in the `Corporations Law,' 
limited liability companies set up by state-owned sole 
proprietorship enterprises, by more than two state-owned 
enterprises, or by more than two state-owned investment 
subjects, carry out democratic management through staff and 
workers representative conferences and other forms according to 
the Constitution and regulations in relevant laws." Regarding 
the functions and powers of staff and workers representative 
conferences, the regulations of the "Enterprises Law" should be 
carried out in principle and we should study and solve new 
problems in adapting to the requirements of the corporation 
system. 
  When boards of directors, supervisory boards, and 
shareholders general meetings are set up in these types of 
enterprises, a certain number of staff and workers 
representatives should be elected by the whole staff and workers 
or by staff and workers representative conferences of 
enterprises, to take part in these bodies. In public ownership 
and nonpublic ownership enterprises, especially in foreign 
business-invested enterprises and private enterprises, it is 
necessary to set up a system of consultations and negotiations 
and of signing collective contracts. Trade unions should carry 
out on behalf of staff and workers and enterprises equal 
consultations and negotiations on labor remuneration, working 
hours, holidays and vacations, labor protection, insurance 
welfare, women's special protection, and other labor rights and 
interests, and sign collective contracts which standardize the 
relations of both parties, promote cooperation between both 
parties, and build up stable and coordinated labor relations, 
thus implementing the principle of relying on the working class 
in enterprises. 
  Fourth, we should conscientiously ensure and safeguard 
the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers and do 
practical jobs and good things for them. While continuing 
to safeguard the political and democratic rights of staff and 
workers, it is a major issue that cannot be neglected to attach 
importance to safeguarding the material interests and the right 
to work of staff and workers. This has a direct function and 
impact on getting hold of the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability. The "Decision" by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Congress pointed out that it was 
necessary to respect the pioneering spirit of the masses and 
safeguard their legitimate rights and interests. The task of 
reform and development this year is extremely heavy and many 
reform measures of great strength and involving a wide range of 
subjects have been, or will be, introduced. It is really not an 
easy job to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
of the national economy and to maintain social stability in the 
course of speeding up transformation of the system. Thus, in 
promoting various reforms, developing various jobs, and handling 
various contradiction relations, we are required to pay much 
attention to understanding the ideological sentiments of staff 
and workers and help them solve practical problems of our own 
accord while conscientiously safeguarding their rights and 
interests. At present, there are some problems with the bearing 
capacity of staff in the various localities in the course of 
turning losses into increased profits for loss-making 
enterprises, of placement of enterprise surplus staff and 
workers and bankrupt enterprise staff and workers, occupational 
recommendations, relief and basic livelihood guarantees for 
staff and workers who are badly off, social insurance system, 
housing system, and pricing system, as well as problems that 
have appeared in delayed payment of wages and pensions for staff 
and workers in some organizations, government departments 
concerned and enterprises should solve the above problems 
properly and strictly in accordance with relevant state 
regulations. We should give priority to efficiency and 
consideration to fair play, reform the distribution system, and 
accomplish the combination of responsibility, power, and 
interests, the unity of state, collective, and individual 
interests, and the linkage of the labor of staff and workers 
with their labor results, thereby truly embodying the principle 
of to each according to his labor. We should quicken the pace 
of reform of the social insurance system and build a mechanism 
to safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of staff and 
workers. We should work out standards of guarantees for staff 
and workers basic livelihoods and build the lowest wage system 
and a mechanism for normal wage growth. 
  Fifth, to rely wholeheartedly on the working class, we 
must bring the role of trade union organizations into full 
play. As a mass organization for the working class, trade 
unions are bridges and ties of the party which link with the 
masses of staff and workers. They are also social pillars of 
state powers. With the development of a socialist market 
economy, the pattern of interests of the three sides; that is, 
the state, the collective, and individuals, will gradually take 
shape. Trade unions are the outcome of labor relations and 
economic contradictions. Their status as representatives 
safeguarding the interests of staff and workers has become more 
obvious and their role of democratic channels and social 
regulation has become more outstanding. They will shoulder more 
arduous tasks and play a more important role. Therefore, party 
committees at various levels should strengthen and improve their 
leadership over trade union work according to the spirit of the 
central authorities, place it in an important position on the 
agenda, attach importance to and strengthen the building of 
trade union leading bodies, and help them further open up the 
channels for participating in the government and discussing 
political affairs. In the course of experimenting on the reform 
of building a modern enterprise system, government departments 
concerned should, according to laws and regulation and the 
spirit of directives by the central authorities, absorb trade 
unions into taking part in relevant experimental work in the 
whole process and in all directions, including participation in 
working bodies, drafting documents, and making experiments and 
carrying out follow-up investigations together. Government and 
trade unions should strengthen communications and contacts 
through informal discussions and joint meetings. It is 
necessary to clarify the status and position of trade unions in 
representing the interests of staff and workers in the face of 
the government and enterprises, support them in safeguarding the 
legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers according 
to law, regulate labor relations, and to organize staff and 
workers to develop activities. It is necessary to promote 
various localities to work out detailed rules and regulations 
for the implementation of the "Trade Unions law" and further 
clarify the rights and duties of trade unions. It is necessary 
to support and help trade union organizations to strengthen 
reform and building themselves, carry out positive explorations 
in the organizational system, operational mechanism, and methods 
of activities, accelerate the democratization process and 
carrying out the mass line, and bring the role of trade union 
organizations into full play. 

<H8>    III. </H8>
  To develop a socialist market economy is the great creative 
cause of the Chinese working class and the people of various 
nationalities in China. All staff and workers in China should 
fully understand the historical importance of the task they 
shoulder; they should continue to develop the glorious 
traditions of the working class in the overall situation of 
reform, development, and stability; and they should further give 
play to the spirit of being the masters of their own affairs and 
the role of the main force; and make new and greater 
contributions. 
  --The working class should continue to develop the spirit of 
building an enterprise through arduous effort, regard 
emancipating and developing the productive forces as its own 
responsibility, and make greater efforts to speed up economic 
development. With a high sense of responsibility of being the 
master of its own affairs, it should bring its enthusiasm, 
initiatives, and creativity into full play; base itself on its 
own jobs; learn and catch up with the advanced; and strive to 
make first-rate achievements. It is necessary to try to improve 
product quality, provide best quality services, heighten labor 
productivity and economic performance, promote loss-making 
enterprises to turn losses into increased profits, and perform 
meritorious deeds for the national economy to enter a new stage 
by developing on an extensive basis a labor emulation drive, 
rationalization proposals, technological innovation, 
technological coordination, and invention and creation 
activities. 
  --The working class should actively support reform, 
conscientiously stand in its forefront, and constantly push 
forward the socialist cause of reform. The reform we are 
carrying out is the most brilliant cause in the history of 
mankind. The working class should perform its glorious duty as 
the master and the subject of reform, actively plunge itself 
into it, and suggest ways and means for its smooth progress; it 
should support the party and the government in introducing a 
number of important reform policies and measures, and take the 
initiative in participating in various reform practices; and it 
should correctly understand the gain and loss of interests in 
reform, handle well the relations between personal and 
collective interests, partial and overall interests, and 
immediate and long-term interests. It should soberly understand 
that the deeper the economic structural reform, the more the 
interest pattern is readjusted and the more expanded the role of 
market; the more we working class should stress ideals, 
discipline, unity, and the overall situation, the more we should 
develop the fine tradition of the working class and the spirit 
of "people in the same boat helping each other" and of taking 
the situation as a whole into consideration; and the more we 
should uphold the road of common development and common 
prosperity. 
  --The working class should be the model of stability, and 
give full play to its role in safeguarding social political 
stability. For a country like China with a large population and 
a relatively undeveloped economy, nothing can be done without a 
stable political situation. The working class should establish 
the idea of the legal system, treasure and safeguard the 
political situation of stability and unity, and consolidate and 
strengthen the unity and unification of the working class 
contingent. It is necessary further to make clear that we 
should rely wholeheartedly on the working class, on the working 
class as a whole, relying mainly on industrial workers, 
intellectuals, and administrators. Their fundamental interests 
coincide. Industrial workers are required to have culture, 
knowledge, and technique; intellectuals are required to have 
practical experiences and to be integrated with workers; 
administrators are required to have culture, knowledge, and 
technique, required to have practical experiences, and also 
required to have management ability and a sense of the masses. 
Therefore, industrial workers, intellectuals, and 
administrators should strengthen unity and coordination among 
themselves and should especially handle well the relations 
between the leaders and those who are led. It is necessary to 
resolutely oppose various activities of splitting the working 
class contingent, to actively participate in comprehensive 
control of social security, and to resolutely struggle against 
various illegal and criminal activities and negative and corrupt 
phenomena. 
  --The working class should further strengthen the building 
of 
spiritual civilization and strive to improve the quality of its 
own. The development of a socialist market economy puts forward 
higher requirements on the overall quality of staff and workers. 
We must uphold the principle of dual tactics and both tactics 
should be tough. The broad masses of staff and workers should 
seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the knowledge of 
the market economy and scientific and cultural knowledge, 
strengthen education on social morality and occupational 
morality, constantly improve the cultural and technological 
quality and ideological and political quality of staff and 
workers contingent, and enhance their competitive power. They 
should actively initiate upholding a correct world outlook and a 
civilized and healthy way of life in the course of developing a 
socialist market economy, influence and bring along the whole 
society by the advanced ideas and model actions of the working 
class, push forward the building of the socialist spiritual 
civilization, and promote overall social progress.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "UK Group To Search For Trade Agreements"] </F>
  [Text] A hundred British bankers, traders and 
industrialists hope to expand their stakes in China with a 15 
day tour of a dozen cities in September. 
  Sir Peter Cazalet, vice-president of the China-Britain Trade 
Group, said he hoped the mission would usher in a new era for 
Chinese-British co-operation. 
  The hosts are the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co- 
operation, China International Trust and Investment Corporation, 
Ministry of Construction and the Bank of China. 
  Senior executives from major conglomerates, such as APV plc, 
General Electric Corporation and National Westminster Bank, will 
discuss wide ranging business issues with the Chinese. 
  Sir Peter, also chairman of APV, one of the world's largest 
food and beverage equipment manufacturers, was in Beijing last 
weekend preparing for the visits. 
  The corporate executives expect to see Chinese leaders, Sir 
Peter said. APV, which has provided equipment to hundreds of 
companies in China, has just completed paperwork for an 
equipment manufacturing plant in Beijing. 
  According to Sir Peter, the new plant, in its initial phase, 
will manufacture fluid handling components such as valves, 
pumps, clamps and fittings of international standards. 
  The plant, to be located in the northeastern suburbs of 
Beijing, will be a base for business expansion of APV, which has 
offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. 
  "We need experience for operations in China, and the plant 
will be a test site for seeing how deep and warm the water 
really is in the country," he said. 
  In an interview with CHINA DAILY, Sir Peter said APV has a 
long- term commitment to the "dynamic, enormous" Chinese market. 
It plans further investments at a later date. 
  Market surveys are under way to check out prospects for 
making larger equipment in China. 
  At some future date, APV will launch ventures to manufacture 
stainless steel pumps and heat exchangers. 
  Chinese graduates from several colleges such as Wuxi Light 
Industry College will be trained under APV's Seligman 
Fellowships. Trainees may spend time learning their jobs in 
Britain. More training programmes will help upgrade technology 
for increasing food and beverage exports, he said. 
  The revolution of eating and drinking habits in China to 
meet 
modern community requirements will take a long time to 
accommodate APV's long-term operations in the country, Sir Peter 
said. 
  He said the mix of food and beverages produced in China is 
becoming more hygienic and nutritious. APV will help Chinese 
accelerate the process.

  [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- President Alberto 
Fujimori of the Republic of Peru said here today that Peru 
attaches much importance to its ties with Asia, and China in 
particular. 
  China's endeavor to build a socialist market economy has 
yielded great success, the president said a press conference 
here today. 
  He noted that China is not only one of Peru's most important 
trade partners, but also its third largest foreign investor. 
  The current visit has enabled him to have a first-hand 
knowledge of the great achievements of his host country, said 
Fujimori, whose last trip here was made three years ago. 
  China's successes would not have been achieved without the 
political system and the democratic form that conform to its own 
national conditions, he said. 
  No matter what a political system or democratic form is 
called, it is crucial that they should fall in line with the 
conditions of that country, he stressed. 
  Referring to Peru's experience, Fujimori said that the sort 
of democracy and political system Peru once inherited from the 
West had, in fact, infringed upon human rights and brought about 
disasters to the people and their nation. 
  Since 1992, he said, Peru has been trying to build a 
political system that best suits its own national conditions. 
As a result, the economy has recovered, foreign exchanges 
increased and inflation effectively curbed, he said. 
  No country should be allowed to interfere in the internal 
affairs of other countries, he said, adding that only when 
countries respect each other, can people develop economy, 
safeguard world peace and build up a new world order.

  [Text] Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A Sino-Peruvian press 
communique was issued here today in which the presidents of the 
two countries expressed willingness to continue concerted 
efforts for the long-term and stable growth of bilateral ties. 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori made a state visit to 
China from June 8 to 12 at the invitation of Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin. 
  The communique mentioned the official talks between the two 
presidents and a meeting between Chinese Premier Li Peng and 
Fujimori. 
  The communique said that the leaders of the two countries 
discussed bilateral ties and expressed satisfaction with the 
development of bilateral friendly ties and cooperation in the 
fields of politics, economy, trade, culture, science and 
technology since the two countries established diplomatic 
relations 23 years ago, and with the consensus they had reached 
on international affairs. 
  Peru reaffirmed in the communique that it abides by the 
principles of a communique on the establishment of diplomatic 
ties between the two countries, adhering to its "one-China" 
position and recognizing the Government of the People's Republic 
of China as the sole legitimate government representing the 
whole country. China expressed appreciation for this, the 
communique said. 
  The communique said that the two countries signed an 
agreement on the promotion and mutual protection of investment, 
a Sino-Peruvian consular agreement, and an agreement for the 
Bank of China to provide Peru with export credits. 
  The leaders of the two countries exchanged views on the 
situation in their respective regions and the rest of the world 
as well as other major international issues and reached 
consensus on these issues. 
  China wants to further its friendly cooperation with Latin- 
American countries. The leaders of the two countries noted that 
they enjoy common interests in developing relations between the 
Pacific Basin and Latin-America and desire to continue their 
efforts to contribute to this. Fujimori invited Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin to visit Peru at a time convenient to him, 
which Jiang accepted with pleasure.

  [Text] [video shows shots of Pan Zhaomin speaking from a 
prepared script to several hundred people in military uniform at 
an outdoor area] The Lanzhou Military Region [MR] called a 
mobilization meeting on patriotic education at a Xinjiang 
Military District [MD] engineering corps this morning. 
  Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of the Lanzhou MR 
and 
political commissar of the Xinjiang MD, spoke at the meeting. 
He said: We should thoroughly recognize patriotism's special 
significance to army building. The ideas of patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism, as well as the spirit of dedication 
to national defense and of self-improvement and self-reliance 
should take root among cadres and fighters. 
  He said: We should further foster patriotism in the new 
historical era, which calls for adhering to the party's basic 
line to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up; establish 
a socialist market economy; and build a strong, prosperous, 
democratic, civilized, and modern socialist power. The great 
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that we 
have pursued is one of combining socialism with patriotism. 
Upholding patriotism to safeguard the Chinese nation's 
independence and dignity is the important foundation of 
contemporary socialism, as well as the source of strength for 
all Chinese people to struggle in unity. 
  He said: The purpose of patriotic education is to foster the 
sentiments for frontier, barracks, and one's own work. We 
should strive to perform meritorious services at our own posts. 
We should be clearly aware that devoting ourselves to our own 
work, doing a good job at our own posts, and endeavoring to make 
contributions through our work are concrete manifestations of 
patriotism. We should translate the idea of serving the country 
with concrete actions. 
  He said: During several decades of defending and building up 
the frontier, a large number of models and heroes working 
assiduously and sacrificing selflessly for the motherland have 
come to the fore. In light of the realities in the military 
region and district, we should educate cadres and fighters with 
the advanced deeds of both national and regional heroes and 
models.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Report: "Anhui Reaps Summer Grain Harvest"] </F>
  [Text] This year, the output of Anhui's midseason grain 
and edible oil crop is better than expected. Anhui is expected 
to reap another bumper wheat harvest this year, following that 
of last year. Though hit by many natural disasters, the province 
is still expected to reap a good rapeseed harvest, thanks to the 
expanded acreage for rapeseed. The midseason harvest will lay a 
solid foundation for the healthy and steady development of this 
year's rural economy and even for the entire national economy. 
  According to statistics, the province is expected to reap 
summer grain this year from 2,121,300 hectares out of the sown 
2,148,700 hectares, registering a reduction compared to the 
previous year. Despite this, gross summer grain output is 
expected to post a slight increase over the previous year and to 
become the second-highest record year in history, thanks to the 
joint efforts of all in the province. This year's summer grain 
bumper harvest did not come easily. The major reasons behind 
the bumper summer grain harvest are as follows: First, Anhui 
conscientiously implemented the economic policies for rural 
areas worked out by the central government; mobilized farmers' 
enthusiasm for farming; increased investment for midseason 
production; and enhanced field work management. Second, weather 
conditions during the summer grain growing period were generally 
favorable. The warm winter was favorable as it allowed summer 
grain to survive; it enabled it to grow smoothly and quickened 
the turning green of wheat after spring. Summer grain seedlings 
grew well after spring. In addition, high temperatures in the 
mid and late growing period, and favorable sunlight, 
temperatures, and water conditions were favorable for the 
ripening of wheat, increasing the weight of summer grain, and 
for raising unit output. Third, plant diseases and insect pests 
were not serious. As a solid job was done in the prevention of 
plant diseases and insect pests, the harm to summer grain was 
reduced considerably. Fourth, the campaign to promote high 
output resulted in enlarged acreage and a balanced increase in 
the output of summer grain. The province set up various types 
of high-output demonstration farms whose acreage totals 133,000 
hectares. Fifth, all levels of government and agricultural 
departments enhanced leadership and guidance over midseason 
production. 
  Of the 891,200 hectares of sown rapeseed acreage, nearly 
130,000 hectares were hit by frost earlier this year and had to 
be abandoned. Because localities made timely replanting, it is 
estimated that at present the harvested acres for rapeseed total 
786,700 hectares, 33,000 hectares more than the previous year. 
Having been hit by storms and high temperatures, the province's 
rapeseed harvest is down slightly, judging from localities' 
reports; but this year is still a good year for rapeseed output. 
At present, harvesting and thrashing of rapeseed have been 
completed. Harvesting and thrashing of summer grain is in the 
final stages. While stepping up harvesting, localities are 
striving to store all harvested grain in warehouses and to reap 
a bumper summer grain harvest.

  This year, the government has increased the price by tens of 
yuan for every 50 kilos of cotton.

this 
year. 
  Its normal, annual output accounts for one fourth of the 
country's total.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Report: "Municipal Committee for Comprehensive </F>
Management of Social Order Maps Out Plans for Improving Social 
Order in the Summer and Calls For Intensified Efforts To Check 
the `Six Vices'"] 
  [Text] The Shanghai Municipal Committee for the 
Comprehensive Management of Social Order held its 12th plenary 
session yesterday to map out plans for cracking down on criminal 
activities by hooligans and for improving social order in the 
summer. Wang Liping, deputy secretary of the municipal party 
committee and chairman of the municipal committee for the 
comprehensive management of social order, spoke at the meeting. 
  Wang Liping said: In recent years Shanghai has taken tough 
and resolute measures to check activities in connection with the 
"six vices," and we have received favorable comments from people 
at home and abroad. However, in some places the activities have 
continued despite efforts to check them. Therefore, all 
localities and departments should pay attention to this 
situation and intensify efforts to crack down on such 
activities. Wang Li Ping stressed: Once discovered, 
prostitution, gambling, drug abuse, drug trafficking, persons 
engaged in spreading pornographic publications and products, and 
owners of public entrainment facilities trying to seek customers 
by means of sex must be resolutely investigated and punished 
according to law. In dealing with criminal elements and gang 
leaders who refuse to repent despite repeated education, it is 
necessary to apply the principle of meting out severe punishment 
promptly. The practice of replacing penalties with a fine or 
replacing education with a fine shall not be permitted in 
dealing with these people. Criminal elements who have been 
found to assist or protect "six vices" activities, and party 
cadres who participate in prostitution activities must be 
investigated and severely punished. Law-enforcement departments 
must resolutely resist the practice of pleading for mercy for 
somebody and strengthen overall control over and day-to-day 
management of public entertainment facilities. Resolute 
measures must be taken to close down public entertainment 
facilities that operate in violation of the law and that have 
refused to reform themselves after repeated warnings. All 
public entertainment facilities must observe and abide by the 
provisions governing the management of social order. In 
Shanghai, under no circumstance shall we allow the existence of 
a place that is beyond the reach of the law. Participating in 
the meeting were Zhu Daren and Gu Nianzu, vice chairmen of the 
municipal committee for the comprehensive management of social 
order, and leaders of various districts, counties, departments, 
commissions, and offices who are also members of the municipal 
committee for the comprehensive management of social order.

  [Text] According to the latest statistics issued by the 
provincial statistics bureau, from January to May this year, our 
province's accumulated total industrial production exceeded 
193.8 billion yuan, an increase of 23.2 percent over the same 
period last year. During the first five months of this year, 
although industrial enterprises in our province encountered 
numerous difficulties in production and operations, statistics 
show that industrial production in our province is still 
advancing along a favorable path. Production and sales rates of 
our industrial enterprises increased each month. Their 
production and sales rate in May reached 95.8 percent, and the 
sales volume of their products on both domestic and 
international markets rose gradually. 
  As a result of this year's implementation of the policy of 
unifying foreign exchange rates, the enthusiasm of enterprises 
and relevant departments has been aroused. This has enabled the 
increased output value of export products to exceed growth in 
total industrial output value for the first time, and the margin 
of the increase was 8.4 percentage points. 
  At present, an electronics products structure has been 
formed 
in our province, mainly consisting of electric appliances, such 
as air conditioners and hi-fi equipment. The extensive 
application of high technology is gradually changing low 
efficiency.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province, a 
rising economic giant in south China, has achieved sustained 
economic growth, a provincial government spokesman said here 
today. 
  Addressing a news conference today, the spokesman said that 
Guangdong scored a 15 percent increase in the gross domestic 
product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- in 
the first quarter of 1994. 
  He predicted that Guangdong's GDP will rise 16 percent in 
the 
first half of this year over the same period in 1993. 
  He cited the following figures to illustrate Guangdong's 
rapid economic growth during the January-April period this year: 
  -- Industrial output value reached 125.3 billion yuan, up 
22.5 percent; 
  -- Retail sales amounted to 51.86 billion yuan, a 32.5 
percent increase, six percentage points higher than the nation's 
average; 
  -- Exports soared 115 percent to 11.47 billion U.S. dollars; 
  -- Imports shot up 104 percent to 7.6 billion U.S. dollars; 
and 
  -- Investments in fixed assets by state-owned enterprises 
and 
institutions totaled 21.6 billion yuan, up 40 percent, with 
growth rate down 78 percentage points from the same period in 
1993. 
  The spokesman said that the reform of the foreign trade 
system had brought in a greater inflow of foreign investments 
into Guangdong. 
  For example, Guangdong used a total of 4.09 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign funds in the first five months of 1994, 
nearly 38 percent higher than in the same period last year.

  [Text] Since April of this year, Guangxi has carried out a 
regionwide commodities prices examination and achieved some 
initial results in connection. 
  By early May, Guangxi had investigated a total of 1,427 
price-related cases, confiscated illicit incomes totaling 27.62 
million yuan, handled a total of 1,043 price-related cases, and 
collected price-related fines totaling 2.4 million yuan. 
  In view of a series of problems exposed during the region's 
commodities prices examination, including an unbalanced 
crackdown on price-related cases, ineffective measures against 
price-related cases, slack regulation and control of daily 
necessities and services prices, and so on, the regional 
people's government held a regional prices examination work 
conference in Nanning on 9 June. 
  Liu Xueyue, regional people's government secretary general, 
said in his speech to the conference that the second-stage of 
the regional commodities prices examination will be directed at 
certain basic daily necessities, production means, and services 
prices, including grain, chemical fertilizer, agricultural goods 
and materials, electricity, and so on. 
  With regard to grain and other basic necessity prices, Liu 
noted that conscientious efforts should be made to implement the 
state grain prices reform plan and relevant measures, market 
prices control measures, and so on. The whole region should 
strictly control price hikes, especially those relating to bus 
and train fares; prohibit enterprises and operators from raising 
chemical fertilizer prices, agricultural goods and materials 
prices, and electricity prices without state approval; and 
prohibit enterprises and operators from altering state guidance 
prices as well as other prices set by the state, such as, prices 
set by the State Council or the regional people's government. 
Moreover, Liu stated that the whole region should strive to 
implement to the letter a series of preferential prices set by 
the state for farm and sideline products and prohibit relevant 
units from raising basic services prices, such as, rent, water 
prices, electricity prices, bus fares, and telephone charges.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Hsiang (7627 3276): "Hunan Gives </F>
Preferential Treatment to External Businessmen Investing in 
Agricultural Development"] 
  [Text] Being an interior province, Hunan still lags behind 
the coastal provinces in the use of foreign funds, but being 
referred to in history as a land of fish and rice, it has many 
favorable conditions for agricultural development. In order to 
attract Hong Kong and foreign investors, the Hunan Provincial 
Government recently formulated new regulations and offered more 
favorable conditions to them. 
  Hong Kong and foreign businessmen are encouraged to make 
investments in the following projects: 1) The construction of 
basic agricultural facilities; 2) The planting and raising of 
high-yield and good-quality crops and animal breeds; 3) The 
development of forestry; 4) The development of aquiculture; 5) 
Tests and application of modern agricultural techniques and 
technologies; 6) Processing of farm, forest, animal, and fishing 
products; and 7) other export-oriented agricultural development 
projects. 
  External businessmen may make investments or may carry out 
cooperation in the form of providing funds, materials, 
industrial property rights, patented technologies, or other 
property rights. The Chinese side may make investments or may 
carry out cooperation by means of providing funds, land assets 
or land use rights, plants, equipment, technologies, crops, 
forests, water resources, and other property rights. 
  If external businessmen want to make independent investments 
to run crop, forest, animal, and fishing farms, they may do this 
by going through the formalities for the transfer of the land 
use rights. After acquiring the land use rights, the external 
investors will be able to carry out their development projects, 
and they also may transfer the land use rights to other people 
after they fulfill the requirements of the first transfer 
contracts. If external businessmen independently develop 
collective agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, 
they may go through the formalities according to the contracts 
on the use of collective land, but the collective land cannot be 
resold. 
  When external investors use state-owned land to launch their 
development projects, the longest term of land use may reach 50 
years. The land use contracts may be extended if the same land 
is still in use. If external investors use state-owned land to 
launch development projects in the fields of agriculture, animal 
husbandry, and fishery, they may be exempted from paying land 
use fees for 10 to 15 years as of the date of approving the land 
use. If the land is used to develop forestry, the term of 
exemption may be 20 to 30 years. 
  In their investment in agricultural development projects, 
external businessmen also may enjoy the following favorable 
taxation arrangements: 
  First, when foreign investors launch developing agricultural 
projects or introduce improved varieties and animal breeds 
recognized by the provincial government to separated test zones, 
their income from the test cultivation in the process of 
scientific research will be exempted from local taxes for a 
certain period of time. 
  Second, the improved seeds, seedlings, stud stock, feed, 
medicine for protecting plants and animals, and the tools and 
equipment for processing farm products imported by the 
enterprises with external investment for the purpose of 
exporting farm products will be free from customs tariff. 
  Third, a reasonable quality of materials and appliances used 
by the external staff of the enterprises with external 
investment in their daily lives are free from customs tariff. 
  Fourth, with the approval of the customs authorities, the 
agricultural development zones may set up comprehensive bonded 
warehouses and bonded factories. The goods imported to such 
bonded facilities are completely free from customs tariff. The 
farm products for further processing shipped by the chain 
enterprises and for indirect export are free from customs tariff. 
  If the products are related to export licenses and export 
quotas, the external investors may apply for such licenses and 
quotas from the authorities in charge of foreign trade, which 
first will meet the needs of foreign-funded enterprises involved 
in developing agricultural projects in the issuance of export 
licenses and quotas. 
  The provincial government also requires in the regulations 
that local governments at all levels, as well as relevant 
departments, offer effective assistance to external investors 
involved in agricultural development projects, and help them 
solve problems in their production and daily lives, and 
guarantee their legitimate rights and interests.

  [Text] Listeners, we now broadcast excerpts of the 
government work report delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at 
the second session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional 
People's Congress on religious work towards ethnic groups and 
achievements in the construction of democracy, legal system, and 
spiritual civilization in the first part of the report -- Review 
of the Work in 1993. 
  The government work report noted: National unity was further 
enhanced. Cadres from ethnic groups increased soundly. The 
study, use, and development of written and spoken languages of 
nationalities continued to receive attention. The construction 
of the Great Stupa and Memorial Hall for the 10th Bainqen was 
completed and a solemn inauguration ceremony was held. The 
management of religious affairs was strengthened and the regime 
and procedures on the administration of temples were worked out. 
In the meantime, efforts were made to guide a large number of 
people professing religious beliefs to contribute to social 
stability and economic development. Thanks to the profound 
concern and direct guidance of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council as well as the joint efforts of party and 
government organizations across Tibet, work for carrying out 
policies had been completed. During the period from 1980 to 
1993, a total of 220 million yuan was spent for carrying out 
various policies, including nearly 100 million yuan for temples. 
  The autonomous regional people's government has 
conscientiously implemented resolutions adopted by the regional 
people's congress and its standing committee and actively 
subjected itself to supervision. It has earnestly handled 
motions submitted by people's deputies and members of the 
regional committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference as well as letters and visits from the 
people. 
  The autonomous regional people's government has submitted 
six 
local laws and regulations to the regional people's congress for 
examination and approval, and drawn up a number of 
administrative regulations. It has extensively launched a 
campaign for popularizing the laws; thus constantly enhancing 
legal concepts of the broad masses of cadres and people. The 
competition in creating model dual-support counties and cities, 
the joint armymen-policemen-civilian activities of constructing 
and creating spiritual civilization, and the work of resettling 
and giving special care to dependents of revolutionary martyrs 
and servicemen have made new progress. The education aimed at 
nurturing a new type of citizen with high ideals, moral 
integrity, a better education, and a strong sense of discipline 
and characterized by patriotism, socialism, and Marxist national 
and religious concepts was further popularized in depth. New 
achievements have been made in constructing socialist spiritual 
civilization.

  [Text] Listeners, we have broadcast excerpts of the first 
part -- Review of the Work in 1993 -- of the Government Work 
Report delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the second 
session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress 
in this program in the past few days. Beginning today, we will 
broadcast excerpts of the second part -- Exercise Greater 
Efforts in Reform and Promote Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy 
Economic Development. 
  Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said in his report: The year 1994 
is crucial for Tibet to promote reform in all fields as a whole, 
make breakthroughs in key areas, and accelerate the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The 
guiding principles for the government's work are: Taking 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the 
guidance to comprehensively implement the guidelines of Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Fifth 
Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet CPC Autonomous 
Regional Committee; seizing the opportunity; deepening reform; 
opening wider to the outside world; promoting development; 
maintaining stability; continuing to improve microeconomic 
regulation and control; stepping up the infrastructure 
construction; vigorously restructuring the economy; avoiding 
exaggerations of economic results; and promote sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development in Tibet. 
  This year, all kinds of work must serve the overall 
situation 
of reform, development, and stability; reform must be made to 
dominate the overall situation. In restructuring the economy, 
Tibet must uphold the criteria of productive forces, seize the 
opportune time, promote the reform as a whole, make 
breakthroughs in key areas, and keep our framework and systems 
consistent with those of the state. Proceeding from the actual 
situation in Tibet, we must act firmly, carry out policies 
flexibly, and take each step steadily and properly. Governments 
at various levels should meticulously carry out various reform 
measures which have been launched and do a solid job in all 
areas.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Government Work Report delivered by </F>
autonomous regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second 
Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress; from the "News" program -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: For 
some time to come, the guiding principle governing economic 
development in farming and pastoral areas is to deepen reform, 
rely on scientific and technological progress, increase 
investment, make better use of our resources, readjust the 
industrial structure, quicken the pace of eliminating poverty, 
increase peasants' and herdsmens' incomes in keeping with the 
need to establish a socialist market economic system. We will 
continue to stabilize and improve the policy that will remain 
unchanged for a long time to come -- that of letting farmers 
cultivate land independently and herdsmen own the domestic 
animals they raise and conduct their own management. We will 
also institute measures to ensure that land acreage will not 
change with the increase or decrease in the number of people 
working on it; implement a licensing system for grassland 
utilization; clearly define grassland utilization rights; and 
gradually institute the system of transferring, on a voluntary 
basis, the right to use land and grassland in return for 
payments without changing the ownership and designated uses of 
land and grassland. We should increase the proportion of fiscal 
and credit input in fixed assets related to agriculture and 
animal husbandry, and will encourage collectives and individuals 
to increase input in agriculture and animal husbandry. 
  In accordance with market demand, we will revamp the crop 
and 
plant cultivation structure while ensuring steady increases in 
grain output, focusing on the Yarlung Zangbo-Lhasa-Nyang Qu 
Valley and the Nyang He Valley. We will gradually switch to a 
three-crop structure based on grain, cash, and feed crops. We 
will make active efforts to develop animal husbandry in rural 
areas, promote local grain conversion, and speed up the 
construction of bases for fattening cattle and goats. 
  In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu noted: In developing 
village and town enterprises, we should proceed from local 
conditions, map out rational and overall plans, and concentrate 
such enterprises in cities and towns where energy supplies are 
assured, transportation facilities are developed, and the 
economies are relatively brisk. In accordance with market 
demand and local resources, we should launch projects geared to 
whichever sector can be developed. We should organize 
production and management in whichever way is beneficial to 
development. Localities with the right conditions may set up 
joint enterprises across township and county lines. The 
departments concerned should lend full support to the 
development of village and town enterprises in terms of capital, 
technology, manpower, and information, and provide sound 
guidance and service. 
  The report said: With the marketing of newly harvested grain 
this year, we will increase the procurement prices of wheat and 
rapeseeds. After adjusting the price of chemical fertilizer, we 
will convert into direct subsidies for peasant households any 
funds made available as a result of reduced subsidies to 
agriculture-supporting enterprises as compensation for 
policy-induced losses. Both the autonomous region and all 
prefectures, cities, and counties should establish risk-control 
funds for agriculture and animal husbandry, and ensure the 
sustained development of these two sectors. 
  The autonomous region has created a leading group for 
aid-the-poor projects, which will specifically take charge of 
aid-the-poor projects across the region. It will actively aid 
the poor through development, science and technology, and 
resource exploitation so that a number of people will be lifted 
out of poverty within specified periods and become better-off 
gradually.

Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second 
Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress 
-- from the "News" program] 
  [Text] Discussing the tasks of 1994, the report points out: 
In stepping up construction of the infrastructure, we should 
deepen the fixed asset investment reform and gradually set up a 
system under which investments are diversified to several 
sources and decisions are made at different levels. Based on 
the demand for using society's fixed asset investment, on the 
investment scope of various investment sources, and on the 
economic and social benefits and the markets of different 
projects, investments will generally be allocated to 
competitive, infrastructure, and public welfare construction 
projects. Financial investment activities for the construction 
and operation of competitive projects should be carried out in 
the market and decided by the enterprises themselves, while 
investment in infrastructure and public welfare construction 
projects should be made mainly by the state and the autonomous 
region. Regional budgetary appropriations should be invested 
primarily in the construction of agriculture, animal husbandry, 
transportation, energy, posts and telecommunications, and other 
infrastructure facilities, as well as in education, science and 
technology, urban, and other public welfare facilities. 
  The report says: The regional budgetary investment in fixed 
assets this year has increased 50 million yuan compared to 1993. 
This is the maximum amount that the region can afford to make in 
view of Tibet's financial straits. Priority should be given to 
key projects already under construction, as well as agriculture, 
animal husbandry, energy, transportation, posts and 
telecommunications, and other infrastructure facilities. 
Particular attention must be paid to ensuring adherence to the 
construction schedule for and the quality of the renovation of 
the (Yanghuchalong) power station; the revamping of the 
Qinghai-Tibet, Sichuan-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways; the 
repair of the (Fangda) airport; and the comprehensive 
agricultural development project for the Yarlung Zangbo, Lhasa, 
and Nyang Qu River Valleys. We should deepen the enterprise 
reform and continue to implement the regulations for changing 
the operating mechanisms of state-owned industrial enterprises 
and the regional procedures for implementing these regulations, 
seeing to it that enterprises can exercise their autonomy in a 
true sense. We should optimize the organizational structure of 
enterprises through amalgamation, separation, shifts to other 
lines of production, and the establishment of enterprise groups. 
We should expedite the exploitation and utilization of 
resources to transform our advantage in resources into economic 
advantage. We should continue to pay close attention to the 
development of animal, forestry, and mineral products while 
increasing the variety, expanding the scale, and increasing the 
value added to products through intensive processing.

Autonomous Regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second 
Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress; from the "News" program] 
  [Text] Discussing Tibet's opening wider to the outside 
world and efforts to develop foreign trade and tourism, Chairman 
Gyaincain Norbu pointed out in the government work report: In 
further reforming the foreign economic and trade system and 
establishing foreign trade operating mechanisms in keeping with 
the needs of a market economy, we should adhere to such 
principles of reform as unified policies, liberalized operation, 
competition on equal terms, responsibility for one's own profits 
and losses, the integration of industry and trade, and the 
promotion of the agent system. We should focus the reform on, 
first of all, implementing, together with other parts of the 
country, a single foreign exchange rate; on abandoning mandatory 
plans on foreign exchange receipts and payments in the export 
trade, as well as the system of foreign exchange retention and 
delivery; and on introducing the system of settling and selling 
foreign exchange by banks. Second, we should formulate and 
perfect preferential policies to encourage exports. Third, we 
should accelerate the pace of changing the operating mechanisms 
of foreign trade enterprises, in linking their wage, bonus, and 
distribution system with their economic efficiency in earning 
foreign exchange through exports. Fourth, we should grant 
foreign trade autonomy to qualified productive and circulation 
enterprises and set up a number of comprehensive foreign trade 
companies. Fifth, we should strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control in foreign trade and establish a sound 
foreign trade operating order. 
  In seeking to develop foreign trade and economic relations, 
we should pay particular attention to the work in the following 
aspects: We should rely on the region's resources in actively 
promoting the exports of agricultural, animal, native, and 
special products; ethnic handicrafts, and souvenirs for 
tourists. We should bring into play the frontier's advantage 
and improve the facilities of the existing trading ports. While 
expanding foreign trade, we should take the initiative to 
cooperate with neighboring countries in various fields; ensure 
the coordination of production, processing, and exportation 
links; and accelerate the integration of foreign trade, 
industry, agriculture, and technology. We should improve the 
investment environment in order to attract more businessmen to 
invest in Tibet, and we should explore various ways of absorbing 
foreign capital. To increase foreign exchange earnings through 
exports, we should continue to carry out regional cooperative 
projects, joint ventures, cooperation in related fields, 
materials exchanges, and the construction of joint export 
commodity production bases with enterprises in the hinterland. 
  In seeking to promote tourism, we should, in centering on 
quality and efficiency, pay close attention to the resources of 
tourism markets and the development of commodities. We should 
open up new tourist routes and areas, and gradually set up a 
system of connecting tourist points, routes, and areas. 
Moreover, we should actively develop special tourist courses in 
mountaineering, exploration, and scientific surveys so as to 
strive to achieve breakthroughs in this year's number of 
tourists, tourism business volume, and tourism foreign exchange 
earnings. 
  We should attach importance to and strengthen the work 
related to foreign affairs. We should actively coordinate with 
the state's overall diplomacy in ensuring a good job in border 
supervision, consular and foreign affairs, protocol, and 
cooperation with friendship cities. We should seek to create a 
sound peripheral environment and continuously expand contacts 
with foreign countries so as to promote Tibet's reform, opening 
up, and economic construction.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ning Shiqun (1337 0013 5028)] </F>
  [Excerpts] Lhasa, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- The development of a 
market economy has served as a string to tie up lateral economic 
cooperation between Tibet and the inland. Lateral exchanges at 
different levels and in all domains have helped Tibet usher in a 
market economy. 
  According to incomplete statistics, from 1985 to 1993, Tibet 
and inland provinces and regions reached agreement on over 600 
economic and technical cooperation projects, which involved 700 
million yuan in cooperation funds, the transfer of nearly 2,000 
skilled personnel to Tibet, and the import of materials worth 
over 500 million yuan. With annual profits of 70 million yuan, 
these projects have produced rather good economic returns. 
[passage omitted] 
  Tibet has imported equipment, technology, and management 
know-how to upgrade existing enterprises. From 1985 to 1993, 
the autonomous regional economic cooperation office approved 
over 100 technical cooperation projects, of which over 50 have 
been implemented. This has helped upgrade the level of Tibet's 
manufactured goods. 
  Thanks to the barter of materials in connection with 
economic 
cooperation, steel products, automobiles, color televisions, 
cigarettes, brown sugar, tea, and butter have been brought into 
Tibet. This has improved market supply and made life easier for 
the people. 
  Credit funds have been utilized to expand cooperation. With 
the approval of the People's Bank's head office, in 1988 Tibet 
set up special credits totaling 200 million yuan for lateral 
cooperation. Close to 100 funding-cooperation projects involving 
over 500 million yuan in cooperation funds were implemented from 
1988 to 1991, yielding an annual profit of 80 million yuan, of 
which 10 million yuan went to the enterprises. 
  Since the first forum of the CPC Central Committee on work 
in 
Tibet in 1980, state ministries and commissions and over 20 
provinces and regions have offered assistance to Tibet in terms 
of know-how, finance, and materials. While jointly developing 
resources, they have passed on technology, provided technical 
training, and helped Tibetan enterprises raise management 
levels. Following the second forum on work in Tibet, nine 
provinces and municipalities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and 
Shandong helped Tibet build another 43 projects.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondents Luobu Ciren and Bai Bin] </F>
  [Text] Lhasa, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Yixi Cezheng, a 
60-year-old Tibetan woman earns more than 2,000 yuan a year by 
selling apples, grapes and Chinese prickly ash grown in her 
courtyard. 
  Yixi lives in Nangxian County, Nyingchi Prefecture, in the 
eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  Although Tibet is located on the roof of the world, 
Nangxian, 
Bowo, Mainling, Medog and other counties of the prefecture lie 
at an altitude of less than 3,000 meters above sea level. 
  Farmers in the prefecture, known as the key regional 
production centers for fruit and pork, have a tradition of 
cultivating their courtyard economy. 
  "I was inspired by the high cost of transport of dried fruit 
from outside to Tibet to expand my orchard and sell fruit on the 
local market," Yixi said. 
  Almost all families in Nangxian County now have fruit trees 
and many bring the fruit to nearby counties to exchange for wool 
and meat. 
  A survey shows that the income from the courtyard economy 
accounts for one fifth of the gross income in the rural county. 
  Farmers in Bowo County, on the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, are 
more enthusiastic about raising livestock. 
  Dogye, a farmer in Xumo Township, Bowo County, obtains more 
than 7,000 yuan a year from raising 40 pigs annually. 
  "It is common for a family to raise some 50 pigs a year in 
my 
hometown, just like me," he said. 
  In addition, farmers in this area have more than 30,000 
apple 
and walnut trees and produce 550 tons of dried and fresh fruit a 
year. 
  The gross income from the courtyard economy in Bowo County, 
with a population of less than 20,000, amounted to about six 
million yuan in 1993. 
  An official of Nyingchi Prefecture said that the income of 
farmers and herdsmen in the prefecture averaged over 1,000 yuan 
per capita last year, twice as much as rural people in other 
parts of the region. 
  The official attributed the rise of income to the courtyard 
economy. 
  The Nangxian County government plans to increase the number 
of courtyard-planted fruit trees by 23,500 this year by offering 
saplings purchased from the interior parts of the country to 
farmers free of charge, as well as technical services. 
  Gyaca County government has spent 100,000 yuan on buying 
80,000 saplings of apple and peach from central Henan Province 
for its farmers. 
  It also encourages and helps local farmers to raise pigs and 
chickens.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 11 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region will experience a baby boom during the 1997-2000 period, 
according to a regional government official. 
  Tubdain, director of the regional department of public 
health, said that Tibet's population was expected to rise to 2.5 
million from 2.2 million at the end of 1993. 
  He said that the birth rate in Tibet was 23.4 per thousand 
in 
1993, compared with the nation's average of about 11 per 
thousand. 
  "Tibet's population has more than doubled to 2.2 million 
since the early 1950s," he said, adding that Tibetans account 
for 90 percent of the region's population. 
  The region's population rose by 36,000 during the 1992-93 
period, he said. 
  The average life expectancy of Tibetans is currently 65, up 
from 36 in the early 1950s, he said. 
  Tubdain said Tibet does not implement the family planning 
policy in the farming and pastoral areas. 
  "Another factor was that Tibetans enjoy free medical care," 
he said.

  [Text] Kunming, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A gas blowout occurred 
on June 1 while a prospecting team were drilling in the Luliang 
Basin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, proving that the 
province is rich in natural gas resources. 
  With an area of 770 square km, the Luliang Basin is 145 km 
east of Kunming, capital of the province. 
  Wu Lingying, an engineer of the oil exploration bureau in 
charge of the prospecting, said that the prospecting began in 
April this year. No gas or oil had been found in the province 
before. 
  Experts say that the well has been gushing out a million cu 
m 
of gas every day since June 1. 
  Wu said that the Luliang Basin is of the Cenozoic Era. The 
gusher is a breakthrough in Yunnan Province's oil prospecting 
history.

  [Text] Regardless of its strained financial situation the 
provincial people's government recently appropriated its special 
funds to the higher educational institutions to deal with the 
practical problems cropping up in the fixed-quota supplies of 
grains and cooking oil to these institutions, in protecting the 
quality of supplies and restricting price hikes, in subsidies 
for students who have encountered exceptional difficulties, and 
in subsidies for the meat price hike. 
  In his personal approval for the special funds, Acting 
Governor Tian Fengshan asked Zhang Chengyi, assistant to the 
governor, to hold specific discussion with the responsible 
comrades of the financial department, the education commission, 
and the general office of the provincial people's government, on 
the issue of carrying out detailed analysis over the 
difficulties that should be dealt with urgently and over the 
prominent problems cropping up in the education circles. They 
should also make overall arrangements in this regard so as to 
use the funds where they are needed most. 
  The special funds are being distributed to various higher 
educational institutions. Subsidies for the price hikes of 
student mess and those for the students who have encountered 
exceptional difficulties will enable the student from the border 
areas, the minority nationalities, and the poor localities to be 
at ease in study.

Sheng (1795 0524): "The Province as a Whole Has Scored New 
Achievements in the Struggle Against Corruption"] 
  [Excerpts] The provincial party standing committee recently 
heard the report given by the provincial discipline inspection 
commission and the provincial supervisory department on the 
anticorruption work done in the former period. It acknowledged 
the achievements scored by the province in the anticorruption 
work since the beginning of this year and contended that the 
situation in the struggle against corruption across the province 
had been fine, that the achievements scored in this regard last 
year had been consolidated, that various tasks in the 
anticorruption work this year had achieved new progress, and 
that results in some tasks had been obvious. The anticorruption 
work has played an actively role in safeguarding the province's 
political stability, protecting the province's programs of 
reform and opening up, and promoting the province's economic 
development. [passage omitted] 
  During the period from January to April this year, the 
number 
of conferences and meetings sponsored by various departments 
under the provincial party committee showed an 18 percent 
decrease over the same period of 1993 and that of conferences 
and meetings convened by various departments under the 
provincial people's government showed a 50 percent decrease over 
the same period of 1993. The expenses for these conferences and 
meetings showed a decrease of over 630,000 yuan over the same 
period of 1993. The province's approval for the purchase of 
non-productive sedans showed a 16.3 percent decrease over the 
same period of 1993. [passage omitted] 
  During the period from January to April this year, the 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs throughout the 
province investigated and handled 162 serious and appalling 
cases that showed a 107.6 percent increase over the same period 
of 1993. These cases involved in four department-level cadres 
and 32 county-section-level cadres. Of these cases, 40 involved 
over 10,000 yuan of embezzled money. The procuratorial organs 
throughout the province investigated and handled 228 cases of 
economic crimes and of law and discipline violation. Of these 
cases, economic crimes showed a 97.5 percent increase over the 
same period of 1993 and law and discipline violation showed a 
140 percent increase over the same period of 1993. These cases 
involved 21 cadres at or above the county-section level and 327 
cases involved over 10,000 yuan of embezzled money. Of the 327 
cases, 105 involved over 50,000 yuan of embezzled money. 
  During the period, the discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs throughout the province wound up 767 cases in which they 
punished 667 party-member cadres who had violated party 
discipline. Of these cadres, 274 received the heavy punishment 
of being dismissed from their posts and 59 cadres' cases were 
turned over to the judicial organs. They recovered 7.265 
million yuan of economic losses. The procuratorial organs 
examined and prosecuted 159 cases of economic crimes and of law 
and discipline violation and recovered 6,019,500 yuan of 
economic losses. The people's courts at all levels tried and 
wound up 133 cases of economic crimes and violations of law and 
discipline. 
  During the period, work emphasis was placed on implementing 
the relevant regulations of the provincial people's government 
with regard to preventing illegal collection of expenses. The 
provincial people's government dispatched 10 inspection groups 
to carry out overall inspection over the arbitrary collection of 
expenses among the nine cities and autonomous prefecture, 13 
provincial level departments, 18 county-level cities and 
counties, and 245 units of 12 townships and towns. These 
inspection groups also held open rallies to handle these illegal 
collections of expenses. Changchun city corrected and handled 
more than 20 illegal collections of expenses left over from last 
year and recovered 279,000 yuan of illegal proportioning.

<F P=106> [By Ru Tao (3067 3447) and Hao Run (3185 3387): "A </F>
Breakthrough in the `Six Skills' Training of Staff Officers"] 
  [Text] Staff officers manual participation in planning, 
strategy devising, and command with a map, a pen, and a compass 
will end soon. The automation system for headquarters command 
of field operations produced by the ground forces staff academy 
was put into use for teaching in early May. 
  The six vocational skills of reading, taking notes, 
calculation, writing, drawing, and transmission done by hand by 
staff officers of headquarters for many years have become the 
"bottleneck" affecting and restricting headquarters' command 
efficiency due to the low speed and efficiency. Organizing 
personnel to tackle key difficulties for more than two years, 
the ground forces staff academy produced an automation system 
for headquarters' command of field operations, thus realizing 
automatic handling of staff work. Applying this system, staff 
officers, merely by pressing keys, can analyze roads, river 
systems, bridges, and many other essential elements of 
topography without maps, compasses, measuring rules, and other 
tools. The system can display the three-dimensional pictures of 
the topography of battlefields from various angles and 
altitudes, automatically measure and judge the distance, area, 
and the general view, and, in line with the tactical background, 
automatically produce special pictures of parachute landing, 
cross-country, and other operations. Its data base stores 
accurate and reliable materials on several hundred thousand 
characters and symbols, several hundred sets of pictures and 
figures, and more than a hundred thousand data, which can be 
consulted at will and classified for display. This system is 
able not only to "calculate" the mobility, command, and battle 
capacity of troops through the computer but also to incorporate 
the latest achievements of foreign army to replace the 
traditional and simple comparisons of persons and weapons with a 
more scientific comparison of combat capacity. Based on the 
quantity and quality of the military strength and weapons of the 
enemies and ourselves, this system may take into consideration 
the environment, operations, behaviors, and other factors in an 
all-around manner to predict who is to win and advance, who is 
to lose and retreat, thus making command and policy making more 
scientific. Through the system, man can talk to machines to 
have various combat orders, instructions, and plans 
automatically worked out. What is more significant, the system 
has bravely reformed the traditional command process and made it 
possible to have combat orders worked out at the moment when the 
commander is making a decision and have orders issued 
immediately after the decision is made. Applying this system, a 
military mark can be made in one minute and is easy to use and 
revise. This system also makes automatic adding of cipher and 
instantaneous transmission of words and pictures possible and 
can be connected with the current telecommunications equipment 
of the Army. It is convenient to carry and convenient for field 
operations.

5256): "The Living Standard of 660,000 Retired Personnel Will Be 
Guaranteed and 4.1 Million Incumbent Staff and Workers Have No 
Trouble Back at Home"] 
  [Text] Social insurance work has been vigorously developed 
in our province, playing an important role in promoting economic 
development and safeguarding social stability. At present, 4.1 
million incumbent workers and 660,000 retired workers across the 
province have participated in the social insurance program. 
Thus, a multilayered and integrated social insurance system has 
taken its initial shape. 
  Social insurance is a social security measure and a social 
stability mechanism cosponsored and enforced by the state and 
government departments, with the purpose of providing a 
guarantee for the living standard of laborers during maternity, 
old age, illness, burial arrangements, injury, disability, and 
unemployment. Beginning in 1986, on the basis of universally 
establishing at the higher and the lower levels the social 
insurance management organs that are subordinate to the labor 
departments of various levels, our province has conducted a 
series of reforms of the social insurance system with old-age 
insurance and unemployment insurance as the priorities. 
  In line with the principle of "fixing the amount of funds to 
be collected according to the amount of funds to be spent, 
allowing a small surplus, and keeping a portion as accumulation 
funds," we have implemented the method of collecting and 
adjusting old-age insurance funds with social efforts in 
state-owned enterprises and changed the long-practiced method of 
making enterprises assume sole responsibility for all the 
retirement payments. At the end of 1987, 149 counties and 
cities across the province took the lead in China in 
implementing the method of collecting old-age insurance funds of 
state-owned enterprises from social sectors. Beginning 1 
January 1992, this method was carried out in the whole province. 
Starting this year, the method of fixing the percentages of 
old-age insurance funds to be collected from permanent workers, 
contract workers, and temporary workers, collecting these funds 
in an unified manner, and combining them for use has been 
implemented in state-owned enterprises across the province, thus 
effecting an integrated management of old-age insurance for 
state-owned enterprises. 
  We have conducted the program of collecting old-age 
insurance 
funds for collective enterprise workers from the social sectors. 
So far, all counties and cities across the province have 
basically realized the goal of collecting old-age insurance 
funds from the social sectors in cities and counties, with more 
than 80 percent of incumbent workers and retired workers 
participating in this program. 
  We have also established the old-age insurance system for 
temporary workers, Chinese workers in foreign-funded 
enterprises, private enterprise workers, and self-employed 
workers. To meet the needs of the coexistence of various forms 
of ownership and market economic development, and while 
unceasingly improving the old-age insurance system for workers 
of state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises, our 
province has successively issued old-age insurance regulations 
and methods for various kinds of enterprise workers such as 
temporary workers, Chinese workers in foreign-funded 
enterprises, private enterprises, and self-employed workers. 
  In line with the principle of pooling old-age insurance 
funds 
from the state, enterprises and workers themselves, we have 
universally implemented the system of making workers themselves 
pay a basic amount of old-age insurance funds. 
  Starting in 1992, we have reformed the method of calculating 
and distributing the basic old-age pensions for workers and 
selected Baoding, Handan, and Xingtai cities as pilot units. 
The reform plan of Baoding city had been put into trial 
implementation in July 1993. The whole province will promulgate 
the new method for calculating and distributing the basic 
old-age pension and put it into practice within this year. 
  We have universally established the unemployment insurance 
system for enterprise workers. Over the past few years, the 
scope of implementing the unemployment insurance system has 
unceasingly expanded, 23,491 units with 3.86 million workers 
have joined the unemployment insurance program, and the 
unemployment insurance program's dual functions of providing 
relief for unemployed workers and helping them find jobs again 
have been given full play. At present, the whole province has 
provided jobs for 136,700 unemployed people in cities and towns 
and provided relief for the living of 26,000 unemployed people. 
  We have taken active and prudent steps to conduct reform of 
the injury, medical, and female workers' birth insurance systems 
in selected units. Thirty counties and cities across the 
province have implemented the injury insurance reform. In 
reform of the medical insurance system, we have mainly 
implemented the method of pooling medical expenses for incumbent 
workers who suffer serious illness and health-care expenses for 
retired workers from social sectors in some selected units. In 
female workers' birth insurance reform, we have experimented 
with the method of pooling birth funds for female workers from 
social sectors. 
  We have conducted social insurance program and socialized 
management and service work. Labor departments and social 
insurance organs at all levels have enhanced the sense of 
service and strengthened socialized management and service work 
for enterprise retired workers in the principle of "combining 
the efforts of departments and regions and the efforts of 
specialized organs and the masses." Almost 50 percent of the 
counties and cities across the province have established 
management organizations with the self-management of retired 
personnel playing a dominant role. Many counties and cities 
have also conducted "coordinated" service work, such as handling 
all sorts of social insurance procedures and providing 
consulting services.

Protection"] 
  [Text] The agreement signing ceremony for the People's Bank 
of China to grant the Asian Development Bank loan to Tangshan 
and Chengde cities to carry out environmental protection 
projects was held at Shoudu Hotel in Beijing at 1000 in the 
morning of 3 June. 
  The People's Bank of China granted $140 million of an Asian 
Development Bank loan to the Tangshan and Chengde city people's 
governments. Of this sum, Tangshan will take $85 million and 
Chengde will take $55 million. This time, Tangshan will use 
this Asian Development Bank loan for carrying out a group of 
projects for improving the city environment, including the gas 
supply and transmission project of the city gas company, the 
heating supply project of the city heating company in the 
central district, and four other projects. Chengde city will 
use this loan to build the coking gas project. Upon completion, 
the industrial sector and citizens may replace coal with gas, 
the daily gas supply may reach 470,000 cubic meters, about 80 
percent of citizens may have gas supply, and all the produced 
metallurgical coke will be supplied to Chengde Iron and Steel 
Company. Thus, we may have gas supply in these two cities and 
fundamentally solve the pollution problems in these famous 
historical and cultural cities.

<F P=106> ["Interview" with Wang Qun (3769 5028), secretary of the </F>
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region CPC Committee, by special 
correspondent Song Xiaoming (1345 2556 2494): "Emulate Deng 
Xiaoping's Truth-Seeking and Realistic Spirit" -- place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Song] In studying The Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, what are your deepest impressions? 
  [Wang] Comrade Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking and realistic 
spirit made the deepest impression on me. Emancipating the mind 
and seeking truth from facts is a proposition full of 
dialectical materialistic spirit. I believe that it is 
difficult to grasp this way of thinking but it is even harder to 
adhere to this ideological line in practice. Whether one can 
succeed in being "true to the end" is a real test of the level 
and awareness of every leader. It not only tests our 
comprehension and ability to solve problems but, in particular, 
it tests our party spirit, work style, and personal character. 
  [Song] What is your connotation of Deng Xiaoping's 
truth-seeking and realistic spirit of which you speak? 
  [Wang] I think it has three aspects, that is, to be an 
honest man, an intelligent man, and a brave man. The first is 
to be an honest man. "One has to be a man before being a 
writer." This saying tells us that one's writings reflect one's 
character. Without a certain character, it is impossible to 
produce first class work. Similarly, I believe that "one has to 
be a man before being an administrator." Compared with writing 
articles, a person's character is more directly significant for 
an administrator. A person without a first class character as a 
foundation will never make a good official. To emulate the 
truth-seeking and realistic spirit, the number one priority is 
to do things honestly according to scientific and objective 
laws, keep in constant touch with reality, maintain extensive 
links with the masses, find out the changes in the objective 
situation in a timely fashion, accurately tune in to the pulse 
of the masses, and grasp the opportunities which our time gives 
us, so that our decisions are in keeping with reality. Here, 
one must resolutely overcome the bureaucratic work style that is 
detached from reality and resolutely abolish the attitudes and 
ways of playing petty tricks or acting upon assumptions. We 
must try to be the kind of honest persons that Chairman Mao 
often praised. In Chairman Mao's eyes, Marx was an honest 
person, Lenin was an honest person, and scientists are honest 
people because they act honestly according to a scientific 
attitude. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is exactly such an honest 
person. He has always advocated a realistic spirit and has 
always put it into action himself. His writings and speeches 
are of the simple style, without empty talk that is detached 
from reality. His decades of political practice and his 
simplicity and diligence are even more of a glorious model and 
vivid textbook of the realistic spirit. 
  There is now a very bad trend and that is, taking an 
attitude 
of copying and mechanically transplanting, without change, a 
superior's instructions or experience from other places. When 
documents arrive, some people carelessly read them once without 
serious studies, discussions, and thinking. They don't know to 
ask a few "whys" and "hows," nor do they come up with ideas for 
implementation that suit the reality in their localities and so, 
they are only able to copy and mechanically transplant them 
without change. People who take this kind of irresponsible 
attitude will always fail, 10 times out of 10. 
  [Song] This phenomenon still exists today. 
  [Wang] Since the reform and opening up, the economic and 
social features of many places have seen great changes. In some 
places, it is a new plateau every two or three years. It makes 
one excited to watch. However, some places have seen very 
little change; up to today, some still haven't found the right 
way to develop their local economy but only repeat formalistic 
slogans. This kind of irresponsible attitude by leaders is a 
manifestation that their party spirit and enterprising spirit 
are weak. If they do not change their attitudes quickly there 
will be no hope for these places. In actual work, of course it 
is important to come up with realistic decisions but it is 
equally important to turn correct decisions into people's 
actions through actual hard work. Without the latter, no matter 
how good the decisions, they will never materialize. Actual 
hard work is both a work style and a basic method to implement 
policies and it is even more so a test for the party spirit and 
sense of responsibility of each leader. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
has always advocated actual hard work. In recent years he has 
repeatedly demanded that we "squeeze time to do more practical 
things and do more and talk less"; "do a few solid things, 
accomplish something, make oneself credible to the people"; 
"concentrate and do a few things that will make the people 
satisfied and happy"; and "quietly immerse ourselves in work and 
do our own business well." He has especially emphasized: 
"Leaders must do more practical work. The bad work style of 
passing one's days by giving orders and spouting empty words 
must be changed." The teachings and models of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping are the force that impels us to do solid work. 
  [Song] What is an "intelligent man?" 
  [Wang] Modern society is very complex. Especially in China, 
which is in a transitional process moving towards a socialist 
market economy, the society is unsettled and there are many new 
problems, new situations, and new contradictions. Under such 
circumstances, a leader will never make it without a certain 
level of intellect. For a leader to establish the scientific 
attitude of seeking truth from facts and being truthful and 
realistic, an important issue is to learn to analyze and handle 
problems dialectically and overcome one-sidedness or thinking in 
absolute terms. This is both an important theoretical problem 
and a practical problem which occurs often in leading work. I 
believe that the higher one's position in the leadership, the 
more important this problem becomes. 
  [Song] Please elaborate on this in specific terms. 
  [Wang] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made a very important 
point, that is, "take the overall situation into account," 
"yield to the interests of the whole," "minor principles should 
be subordinated to major ones," and consider issues from the 
perspective of the whole. Here, the "overall situation" and 
"major principles" are none other than the "reality of the 
whole," while partial considerations are no more than "partial 
reality." To start from the perspective of the whole means to 
start from the reality of the whole. Most people acknowledge 
this principle but, when concrete problems occur, not everyone 
can keep a clear head. During the 15 years since reform and 
opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has handled many complex 
problems with his political wisdom and set up a glorious model 
for us. 
  [Song] Please give an example. 
  [Wang] For instance, the handling of the "fools' seed" case. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping recalled: "At that time, many felt 
uneasy, saying that he [a person who became rich by selling 
`fools' brand pumpkin seeds] had made a million. And they 
wanted to take him down. I said we cannot take him down. If we 
do, people will say that policies have changed and what we gain 
is not worth what we lose. There are many similar problems. If 
we don't handle them properly, they will very easily deflect our 
policies and affect the whole reform." In Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's perspective, failure to handle the "fools' seed" case 
did no harm to the whole situation; if we had handled the case 
it would have been detrimental to the whole situation. 
  [Song] The outstanding significance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's analysis of the "fools' seed" case lies in its 
exemplary role. In the process of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, complex problems will certainly often 
occur and our leading cadres will certainly be often tested in 
whether they can correctly handle complex problems or not. The 
demonstration by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is no doubt classic for 
all levels of leading cadres. 
  [Wang] Political experience is accumulated gradually. The 
political experience which comrade Deng Xiaoping provides for us 
is very precious. Not only in the "fools' seed" case but in 
many other problems, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has provided 
classical models for us. For instance, in both taking our own 
road and opening to the outside world; in both paying attention 
to the construction of material civilization and to the 
construction of spiritual civilization; in both opposing the 
right and opposing the "left"; in diplomatic strategy, his "we 
still have to make friends but must keep a clear head," etc. 
Whenever faced with important problems and crucial moments, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping is always so clear-headed; his analysis of 
things is always so profound, comprehensive, and to the point; 
his handling of problems is always so appropriate, 
differentiating the important from the unimportant and the 
emergency case from nonemergency ones. Without the skilled 
dialectical thinking of a politician, and without the 
penetrating vision and tactics of a strategist, this would be 
impossible. We must emulate comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking 
and learn to consider and handle problems with materialist 
dialectics. Many things in the field of politics indicate that 
once the leader's way of thinking goes wrong, his mind will not 
be clear before major issues of right and wrong and he will lose 
direction, leading even to political mistakes and bringing 
irreplaceable losses to our cause. 
  [Song] It seems to me that what comrade Deng Xiaoping 
advocates is a spirit of political reasoning. From his theory 
of "white cat and black cat" to his analysis of the "fools' 
seed" case, his rational spirit permeates his career of 
political practice. 
  [Wang] You have a point. 
  [Song] Apart from "being an honest man," and "being an 
intelligent man," why does comrade Deng Xiaoping's truth-seeking 
and realistic spirit also contain "being a brave man"? 
  [Wang] The spirit of innovation and risk-taking is the 
character a modern leader must have. The theory of socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is the most creative theory; the 
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
facts contains in itself the content of creating new things all 
the time. The achievements in reform and opening up and in the 
modernization construction of China in the past dozen years or 
so are exactly the result of the constant creation and 
aggressive advancement of the hundreds of millions of people 
under the leadership of the party. Without a brave spirit, we 
will be unable to accomplish anything, unable to advance even a 
single step. 
  [Song] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always encouraged 
innovation. 
  [Wang] That senior leader once made a very encouraging 
statement: "Without a little spirit of breaking through, without 
a little spirit of `risking,' without a little energy and force, 
one cannot find a good road, or a new road, and cannot 
accomplish new things. Who dares to say that their business has 
a 100 percent guarantee with no risk at all." He repeatedly 
emphasized: "We certainly have to have innovation." What 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping advocates here is a spirit of innovation 
and risk-taking. The "energy" and "force" he mentioned is a 
kind of revolutionary courage, heroism, and boldness. It 
originates from lofty ideals and infinite loyalty to the people. 
In the practice of reform and opening up, the spirit of 
innovation and risk-taking is very precious and needs to be 
advocated. People with a lot of prudence and who do not dare to 
take responsibility cannot do it; people who do not seek 
accomplishments but only seek to make no mistakes cannot do it; 
as for those who have no people, no ideals, and no enterprising 
spirit but only themselves in their minds, they not only cannot 
do it, they can't even understand this spirit of innovation and 
risk-taking. 
  [Song] Brilliant! 
  [Wang] The ideological line of the party is a thoroughly 
materialist one. Only thorough materialists can completely 
understand it and adhere to it to the end because adherence to 
this line is risky, requiring people to pay a price and make 
some individual sacrifices. Those who lack the sense of 
responsibility towards the prosperity and happiness of the 
people, and those who lack enthusiasm towards the vigorous new 
cause, will be unwilling to pay this price. In reality, many 
things demand that leaders have the courage to persist in 
seeking truth from facts. For instance, the masses are very 
critical of unhealthy trends, corruption, and of the serious 
political liberalism which exists within the party. However, it 
is very difficult to correct. One of the major reasons is that 
some leading comrades lack the courage to seek truth from facts 
and they are unwilling to shoulder individual risks. These 
comrades don't understand that if we ourselves are unwilling to 
pay a small price, our party will have to pay a high price. 
Again, we often face the following situation in leading work 
whereby two diametrically opposite views and evaluations arise 
concerning the same thing, the same person, the same history, or 
the situation in the same region and where both sides claim that 
they are seeking truth from facts. This can be due to many 
factors. Perhaps there is a problem of ability and the level of 
comprehension, or a problem of different degrees of 
understanding the situation, or different perspectives in 
looking at things. Often there are problems of different 
ideological viewpoints and the criteria of right and wrong. 
This should be called normal. The problem is, as a leader of a 
locality or unit, one must take the party standpoint. On the 
basis of seeking truth from facts, one must talk and act justly, 
correct the prejudices of some comrades, and encourage those 
comrades who persist in seeking truth from facts. This is 
nothing like "life and death" issues but, if we cannot even do 
this, then how can we handle it when real "life and death" 
situations occur? 
  [Song] The question of placing our individual "self" in 
which position is indeed a crucial one. 
  [Wang] The basis of the party's ideological line, the soul 
of the truth-seeking and realistic spirit, is to place the 
people's interests above all else. The source of courage and 
strength in upholding this ideological line lies in the people. 
In his long revolutionary career, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
considered himself a "son of the Chinese people." He has always 
respected and loved the people and has paid constant attention 
to the people's interests and wishes. He places the starting 
point and goal of all policies and criteria for judging right 
and wrong on "whether the people are happy or not," "whether the 
people agree," and "whether the people support it." It is 
exactly because of this that he is equipped with great courage 
in theory and practice, his correct decisions naturally become 
the willing actions of the hundreds of millions of people, and 
he himself can lead the people fearlessly in battle in the great 
process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  [Song] It seems that whether one can be truth-seeking and 
realistic and whether one can uphold truth is inevitably linked 
to the level of character of the individual. 
  [Wang] This is indeed so. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's rough and 
ragged experience, his revolutionary character of paying no 
attention to personal fame and safety, or gain and loss, but 
constantly upholding truth and principles, truly reflects his 
lofty awareness of unswervingly seeking truth from facts. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great experience educates us that 
Communist Party members who view the people's interests as 
higher and weightier than anything else, are not afraid of 
anything. In his article commemorating Comrade Liu Bocheng, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a moving statement: Comrade Liu 
Bocheng "exerted himself to the utmost, despite 10,000 deaths, 
in order to realize that in which he believed.... Whether in 
successful times or in difficult times, irrespective of time and 
place and changes in the objective environment, he consistently 
contributed his all to the party, submitted his all to the needs 
of the party, and immersed himself in the cause of the party, 
without the slightest consideration for personal fame and gain. 
He truly reached the realm of selflessness." I often think if 
all our leaders, generation after generation, could reach this 
"realm of selflessness," then the leading bodies of the party at 
all levels would certainly become the strong battle 
headquarters, create a good trend, and carry forward the 
truth-seeking and realistic spirit. Thus, in the course of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our ship will 
be able to advance along the correct path toward the glorious 
goal in any kind of turbulent sea.

  [Text] The municipality sponsored a briefing according to 
the provisions set in the "PRC Environment Protection Law" on 3 
June, to release a municipal environmental bulletin, where Liu 
Jinsheng, director of the municipal environment protection 
bureau, announced: Along with rapid economic growth, the 
municipality realized stability in the overall quality of urban 
environment in 1993 and still maintained the high level scored 
in this regard over the past few years. The rate of urban 
sewage disposal, of industrial waste water disposal, and of 
popularizing urban heating supply, were obviously upgraded. The 
norms of building urban environmental infrastructures as well as 
the rate of popularizing urban gas supply, of increasing urban 
vegetation, and of improving garbage disposal, were upgraded in 
varying degrees. 
  The 1993 municipal environmental bulletin reveals that the 
density of urban air pollution, the daily average density of 
nitraoxide in the year, was 0.07 mg/cubic meter and that of 
carbon monoxide was 2.57 mg/cubic meter, which was the same for 
1992. The daily average density of sulfur dioxide in the year 
was 0.14 mg/cubic meter, showing a 2.2 percent decrease over 
1992. The monthly urban fallout was 13.2 tonnes/square km, a 
one tonne/square km decrease over 1992, and the best norm scored 
in this regard over the past few years. The total volume of 
waste gas and steam was 132.2 billion standard cubic meters, 
showing a 0.45 percent decrease over 1992. In 1993, the 
municipality continued to maintain the fine quality of water 
diverted from the Luan river. Of the 20 norms of keeping the 
diverted water clean, the rate of achieving the norms was 98.8 
percent. The diverted water has been one of the best sources of 
water enjoyed by large cities throughout the country. The rate 
of urban sewage disposal reached 26.43 percent to show a 6 
percent increase over 1992. The rate of industrial waste water 
disposal reached 81 percent, showing a 5 percent increase over 
1992. The two norms mentioned above have been at the advanced 
level scored by the large cities throughout the country. The 
average urban noise pollution in 1993 was 59.7 decibels, showing 
a 1.3 decibel decrease over 1992. The 17.7 square km of new 
municipal, small, residential districts free from noise 
pollution were built ahead of the target set in the 1994 plan in 
this regard. The 1993 volume of solid waste discharged by units 
throughout the municipality was 4.2 million tonnes. The rate of 
making use of solid waste in a comprehensive way reached 70.1 
percent, basically the same as in 1992, and the rate of 
conducting comprehensive management over this waste reached 96 
percent, showing an increase of 6 percentage points over 1992. 
The municipal's garbage volume was 1.89 million tonnes and the 
rate of harm-free garbage disposal reached 50.2 percent, showing 
a 5.2 percent increase over 1992. The municipal rate of 
achieving the standards in the auto gas control reached 73.9 
percent, showing a slight increase over 1992. 
  Of the fixed-quota targets in the 21 projects set by the 
state with regard to the comprehensive management of urban 
environment, the municipality fully fulfilled the seven targets 
including the smoke and dust control and industrial waste water 
disposal. It also made progress in the 12 targets, including 
the improvement of sources of potable water and the 
comprehensive management of industrial solid waste. All of 
these have laid a fine foundation for the municipality to become 
one of the 10 outstanding cities throughout the country in 
comprehensive environmental management. 
  During the briefing, Vice Mayor Wang Dehui delivered a 
speech 
in which he put forward the following three demands related to 
successfully carrying out the current work of environmental 
protection: It is hoped that the comprehensive management of 
urban environment will make the obvious upgrade or improvement 
of the quality of the municipal environment and the function of 
municipal carriers possible and provide a fine investment 
environment for the municipal programs of reform, opening up, 
and economic construction and a fine environment for 12th Asian 
Table Tennis Event and the 43d World Table Tennis Championships. 
  Liu Wenfan, vice chairman of the municipal people's congress 
standing committee, attended the briefing for the release of the 
municipal environmental bulletin.

  [Text] The scientific and technological 10-billion-yuan 
project, listed by the municipal government as a major project 
of this year's scientific and technological work, has been 
started in an all around manner and has yielded initial success 
thanks to the active efforts of the participating large 
contingents of scientific and technical personnel in all fields. 
The first group of nine items has been started, with the 
participation of dozens of scientific research institutes, 
institutes of higher learning, and enterprises. In developing 
these items, the scope of industrialization has been expanded 
and commodity production has been organized simultaneously. 
Initial success has been won in this to increase the industrial 
output value by nearly 200 million yuan and to lead the 
development of a number of relevant industries. 
  Beginning this year, the scientific and technological 
10-billion-yuan project plans to build 10 high technology 
industries in five years with an annual output value exceeding 
500 million yuan each so as to promote the development of a 
group of high technology products and establish a group of 
industries whose output value totals 10 billion yuan. Since 
last March when the municipal scientific and technological 
congress put forward the targets of the 10-billion-yuan project, 
the municipal scientific research units stationed in Tianjin, 
the research institutes of the schools of higher learning, 
scientific research institutes under the municipality, large and 
medium-sized enterprises, and high technology enterprises of 
various types have actively participated in the project. After 
screening, the municipal science and technology commission 
decided to cultivate on a priority basis a group of high 
technology achievements with broad market prospects and then 
gradually include them in the 10-billion-yuan project. To date, 
the production of study-oriented video game machine, cortex 
hormone, nickel-hydrogen battery, new-type pesticide, and 
numerical-controlled machine tool has been officially listed as 
items for implementation, and coating technique and three other 
items have also been listed as ones for cultivation on a 
priority basis and given particular support. The first group of 
items to be implemented are high technology products developed 
by the large contingents of scientific and technical personnel 
in various fields after many years of research. The 
technological levels and technical measures of these items are 
among the best in the country or up to the advanced levels of 
the world, their market prospects are very broad at home and 
abroad, and they possess fairly good basic conditions for 
expanding the scope of industrialization. They can be turned 
into highly competitive products in a short time, and their 
output value is estimated at 1 billion yuan this year. Take the 
16-bit study-oriented video game machines first produced by the 
Xinxing Electronic Company, which was established by the no. 46 
institute of the Ministry of Electronic Industry. From January 
to April, 60,000 such machines were produced and sold, and 
orders keep pouring in from domestic areas and foreign 
countries. Including this product in the 10-billion-yuan 
project will help increase its production capacity to 600,000 
and its annual output value to 300 million yuan this year. 
  The scientific and technological 10-billion-yuan project not 
only helps accelerate the industrialization of the scientific 
and technological achievements of scientific research institutes 
but also leads a group of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises to the new road of pursuit of high technology. The 
items on new-type pesticides, numerical-controlled machine 
tools, and other products have been carried out at some dozen 
large and medium-sized enterprises. The municipal general 
pesticide plant cooperated with Nankai University to carry out 
scientific and technological development, thus continuously 
upgrading and updating its products and creating notable 
economic returns. In the first four months of this year, the 
output value created by its new-type pesticides exceeded 70 
million yuan.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Yan Haiwang, secretary </F>
of the Gansu Provincial CPC Committee, and Zhang Wule, governor 
of Gansu Province, by staff reporters Lo Liang-liang (0149 0081 
0081) and Yang Fan (2799 1581), and trainee reporter Chang Chun 
(1728 6511), in Lanzhou; date not given: "Gansu Province Is 
Basically Self-Sufficient in Grain"] 
  [Text] Lanzhou, 6 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- The project to 
divert the water from the Tatong He to the Qinwangchuan region, 
north of Lanzhou, basically has been completed. This project 
will change the backward appearance of the rural areas in 
central Gansu and have a major impact on the province's social 
and economic development. When exclusively interviewed by these 
reporters, Yan Haiwang, secretary of the Gansu Provincial CPC 
Committee, and Governor Zhang Wule both took this project as an 
indication of the tremendous achievements scored by the province 
in reform and opening up, and likened the achievements to those 
currently attained in Dujiangyan. 
  This is one of the key projects financed by the World Bank 
in 
China with a loan of $123 million. The construction of the 
project is difficult because of its large span. The Pandaoling 
Tunnel has an overall length of 15.7 km, and is the longest 
water delivery tunnel in Asia and the seventh longest in the 
world. With the world's most advanced equipment and technology, 
the engineering companies from China, Japan, and Italy, which 
are the contractors on the project, took six years to basically 
complete this magnificent irrigation work, and have been highly 
appraised by the World Bank and the Israeli experts. 
  Yan Haiwang stressed that Gansu, which in the past always 
depended on grain transferred from other provinces, has been 
basically self-sufficient since reform and opening up. Without 
suspension or semisuspension in production, the large and 
medium-sized enterprises here have performed better than those 
in many other provinces. The secretary also pointed out that 
Gansu is an entirely landlocked province, which is not along any 
coast, big river, or border (except for several dozen km of 
borderline contiguous to Mongolia with no economic 
significance). Under the situation in which eastern China is 
growing at a high speed, Gansu is determined to develop its 
strong points and avoid weaknesses so as to restore the prestige 
of the Silk Road, and the people are resolved to work hard for 
the goal of shaking off the province's impoverished appearance. 
  Governor Zhang Wule pointed out: With the market economic 
mechanisms taking effect, large and medium-sized state 
enterprises in Gansu have acquired a fair competitive 
environment. They are getting out of their predicament and 
advancing in a good direction. The construction of the 
multitrack Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and Baoji-Zhongwei Railway 
soon will be completed and opened to traffic, which will 
considerably enhance the province's railway transport capacity. 
Moreover, the province will benefit directly from the 
construction of the second Eurasia Continental Bridge between 
Lanzhou and the Alataw Pass, and its investment environment will 
be further improved. The State Planning Commission plans to 
establish a project to build in Lanzhou a large ethylene plant 
with a production capacity of 660,000 tonnes in a bid to 
increase the economic strength of northwest China, after taking 
into account the adequate output of petroleum and gas in 
Xinjiang and the good industrial and traffic facilities in 
Lanzhou. If the construction of this project is confirmed, the 
province's output value will increase by several dozen billion 
yuan, and Gansu will play an even more powerful role as an 
industrial base in the vast northwest of China.

  [Text] After listening to a report made on 8 June at a 
work meeting of the provincial governor and vice governors by a 
provincial people's government economic and trade delegation 
that had just returned from the United States, provincial 
Governor Zhang Wule emphatically called for further emancipating 
the mind, deepening reform, expanding opening up to the outside 
world, sponsoring more economic and trade fairs abroad, and 
paying more friendly visits to foreign countries and regions so 
as to invite more foreign investment. 
  In accordance with this year's provincial government work 
plan, the Gansu Provincial People's Government Economic and 
Trade Delegation headed by provincial Vice Governor Cui Zhenghua 
recently held "The 1994 Gansu Province Economic and Trade Fair" 
in Los Angeles. 
  After listening to the provincial delegation's report, 
Governor Zhang fully affirmed achievements scored by the 
delegation during its recent visit to the United States and 
hailed the province's trade fair in the United States as a 
complete success. He said: The trade fair has attained the 
desired results. Its success has once again attested to the 
fact that Gansu still has great potential to expanding and open 
up further to the outside world. Therefore, we should make more 
vigorous efforts to emancipate the mind and expand reform and 
opening up to the outside world in the years to come. So long 
as we do a good job in this regard, we will certainly be able to 
expand foreign trade and invite more foreign investment. To this 
end, we should make continued and redoubled efforts to explore 
new methods of deepening reform and expanding opening up to the 
outside world and engage in more foreign-related economic 
activities in the future.

  [Text] "It takes 10 years for a tree to grow up, but 100 
years to train qualified personnel." This Chinese saying shows 
how important training qualified personnel is. The key to 
training qualified personnel lies in developing education. With 
this issue in mind, this station reporter recently interviewed 
provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang on what 
measures Gansu will take to speed up the province's educational 
development in the years ahead and what blueprints Gansu has 
drawn up to this end. 
  [Reporter] Will you please tell me what Gansu has done with 
respect to implementing "The PRC Education Reform and 
Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" in recent years? 
  [Yan Haiwang] The provincial party committee and people's 
government have all along attached great importance to and 
vigorously implemented "The PRC Education Reform and Development 
Program." Gansu Province held a provincial education work 
conference in 1993, which drew up the province's "Opinions on 
Implementing and Instituting `The PRC Education Reform and 
Development Program'." The conference stated in no uncertain 
terms that it is imperative to attach strategic priority to the 
province's educational development and called for deepening 
education system reform and rapidly training all sorts of 
qualified personnel required by the province's economic growth. 
As a result, we have further increased input into education. 
We have also pledged to enable educational funds to account for 
about 4 percent of the province's gross national product, keep 
annual increase of the province's educational funds at and above 
13 percent, and adopt practical measures to annually increase 
education-related operational funds in the Nineth Five-Year 
Plan. Thus we are confident that we will implement to the 
letter "The PRC Education Reform and Development Program" and 
"The PRC Teachers Law" thanks to such a correct guiding ideology 
and the aforementioned policies and measures. 
  Since last year's conference, party committees, people's 
governments, and education departments at all levels across the 
province have conscientiously implemented "The PRC Education 
Reform and Development Program" and "The PRC Teachers Law" in 
light of actual local conditions, actively pushed forward 
educational reform and development with some initial successes, 
and mainly attained the following two goals: First, we have 
raised educational funds through a variety of channels despite a 
flat budget. We raised educational input to a certain extent in 
1993 in comparison with the previous year with the result that 
the province's educational funds rose to 1.496 billion yuan, of 
which budgeted educational funds accounted for 0.959 billion 
yuan, up by 10 percent over the previous year. Moreover, the 
province's per capita educational funds rose to 277.18 yuan, up 
by 5.14 percent over the previous year. Second, we have raised 
wages of primary and secondary schools teachers, repayed more 
than 27.5 million yuan in wages owed to those teachers, and 
basically guaranteed monthly wages for primary and secondary 
schools teachers. 
  Implementation of "The PRC Education Reform and Development 
Program," "The PRC Teachers Law," and Gansu's "Opinions on 
Implementing and Instituting `The PRC Education Reform and 
Development Program'" has given a powerful impetus to the 
province's overall educational development. As a result, some 
54 counties in the province have implemented compulsory primary 
education for all school-age children while some 14 counties in 
the province have implemented compulsory secondary education for 
all school-age children. At present, some 95.8 percent of the 
province's school-age children are going to schools. The 
province's dropout rate has also declined. The ordinary college 
and technical secondary education are now available to more 
people in the province. The province's adult, vocational, and 
in-service education and post-related training have also seen 
rapid growth. A total of 45 counties in the province have 
eradicated illiteracy. The illiteracy rate among the province's 
young and middle-aged people has dropped to lower than 20 
percent. 
  Nevertheless, the province's overall educational standard is 
far below the country's average. The province's educational 
development is still plagued by a series of problems, including 
contradictions between educational development and economic 
construction, and between educational scale and development 
speed, on the one hand, and insufficient educational funds on 
the other, and so on. These problems are unlikely to be solved 
in the foreseeable future. 
  [Reporter] Will you please tell me what specific measures 
Gansu will take to press ahead with educational reform and 
development? 
  [Yan] In accordance with requirements spelled out by the 
State Council, the Eighth Gansu Provincial CPC Congress held in 
1993 put forth a basic train of thought and some basic tasks for 
Gansu's educational reform and development. The basic train of 
thought is: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line, Gansu should comprehensively implement "The PRC Education 
Reform and Development Program"; persistently attach strategic 
priority to educational development; energetically develop 
elementary education by implementing a nine-year compulsory 
education system across the province; continually develop 
vocational, technical, adult, and college education; further 
develop the province's educational cause in terms of quantity 
and quality; strive to raise the province's overall educational 
standard onto a new stage in order to make, by the end of this 
century, compulsory primary education basically available to all 
school-age children and compulsory junior secondary education 
available to about 70 percent of the province's rural 
population; basically eradicate illiteracy among the majority of 
young and middle-aged people in the province; by the end of this 
century, enable all types of technical secondary schools to 
enroll the same number of students as ordinary senior secondary 
schools in the province do, and enable one or two higher 
learning institutions and more than 10 specialities to meet 
requirements laid down in the state "211 Project." 
  [Reporter] What specific steps will Gansu take to make 
educational reform and development successful? 
  [Yan Haiwang] Generally speaking, we're going to take the 
following four specific steps: 
  1. In order to attach strategic priority to educational 
development, leaders at all levels across the province should 
fully understand education's strategic position and role and 
take education as a key link in the province's overall work. To 
this end, principal leaders at all levels across the province 
should personally take charge of educational development while 
members of leading bodies at all levels across the province 
should also show concern for educational development. We should 
constantly study all major issues relating to educational reform 
and development, attach great importance to and support 
educational work, help overcome practical difficulties and 
specific problems in the course of educational development, and 
strive to successfully accomplish educational tasks. 
  2. We should make continued efforts to deepen education 
system reform. To this end, we should mainly try to develop 
elementary education by relying on local resources at the 
moment. We should encourage various undertakings, enterprises, 
and individuals to participate in running all types of 
educational institutions. We should strive to develop college 
education by relying on the government support and gradually 
encourage people of all walks of life in the society to 
contribute to college educational development. We should strive 
to develop technical secondary and adult education by relying on 
concerted efforts on the part of relevant trades, professions, 
undertakings, and enterprises as well as the people of all walks 
of life in the society. Moreover, we should make energetic 
efforts to push ahead with school management and enrollment and 
graduate job assignment system reform, thereby deepening the 
province's overall educational reform. 
  3. We should strive to improve the province's educational 
quality. To this end, we should step up basic knowledge, 
theory, and skills training among students so they will be able 
to ethically, intellectually, physically, and aesthetically 
improve themselves, do more practical work, and become socialist 
builders and successors with ideals, moral integrity, cultural 
accomplishments, and a sense of discipline, 
  4. We should make every possible endeavor to provide 
educational development with necessary assistance, further raise 
educational input, secure a proper increase in educational funds 
year in year out, allocate a certain amount of funds for 
scientific research and educational development and for 
improving housing conditions of teachers as well, and increase 
wages of teachers. To this end, we should first increase wages 
of primary and secondary schools teachers by 10 percent on the 
basis of the newly promulgated professional and technical wages 
scale, continue to pay seniority subsidies to teachers in charge 
of individual classes, increase as of 1 October, 1993, monthly 
wages of non-government schools teachers by 35 yuan, cultivate a 
fine general mood of society in which teachers and education 
will be respected and highly valued, as well as urge and 
encourage social organizations and individuals to donate cash to 
schools or raise funds for schools. In a nutshell, we should 
make every effort to provide education with excellent conditions 
and a favorable environment.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- During a 
meeting with a delegation from the Hong Kong Chinese 
Manufacturers' Association in Beijing today, Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing said that foreign businessmen's investments and 
cooperation with China's northern and hinterland regions conform 
with China's strategy of developing the central and western 
regions, adding that China welcomes their investments and 
cooperation with the northern and hinterland regions. 
  Since the introduction of reform and opening up, China has 
achieved a lot of development in its economy but there are still 
gaps between regions, Li Lanqing said. Enjoying favorable 
conditions, coastal areas are leading in economic development 
whereas the hinterland areas are lagging behind in comparison, 
he added. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: The era is developing, so there is a 
need to deepen economic cooperation methods and contents. After 
several years of development, some of the "three-capital 
enterprises" in the coastal areas should also be upgraded and 
renewed. Northern and hinterland regions are superior to 
coastal areas in land, mineral, and labor resources and their 
transportation and telecommunications facilities are being 
improved. Therefore, there are great prospects for foreign 
businessmen to invest in and cooperate with the hinterland 
regions. 
  Leung Yam-wing, head of the delegation and chairman of the 
association, said that this year marks the 60th founding 
anniversary of the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association. 
The association will hold celebrations in Hong Kong and 
Beijing, including a cocktail party in celebration of the 
establishment of its Beijing office and a "seminar on economic 
cooperation opportunities between Hong Kong and China's northern 
regions" to be held jointly with the All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce on 14 June. Li Lanqing congratulated the 
association on its 60th founding anniversary and wished the 
seminar all success. 
  Among those present at the meeting were: Wang Zhaoguo, vice 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference and chief of the CPC Central 
Committee's United Front Work Department; Jing Shuping, chairman 
of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Zhu 
Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong 
Branch.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with a delegation from the 
Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions headed by its President Lee 
Chark Tim here today. 
  During the meeting, Qian reiterated China's policy of "one 
country, two systems", and expressed his hope that the 
federation would, under the banner of loving both the mainland 
and Hong Kong, make further contributions to the realization of 
a smooth transition and maintaining stability and prosperity in 
Hong Kong after 1997, by uniting with the Hong Kong people from 
various circles. 
  Qian also briefed the visitors on the domestic situation, 
saying that with efforts of over a decade, China has made great 
achievements in its reforms and opening-up and that the 
investment environment has also been improved profoundly. 
  Lu Ping, director of the Hongkong and Macao Affairs Office 
of 
the State Council, was among those who were present at the 
meeting. 
  The delegation arrived here on Sunday [12 June] at the 
invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

  [Text] China's top official on Hong Kong, Lu Ping, 
yesterday warned that the territory would "perish" unless it 
played a constructive role in the development of the mainland. 
The threat was made after a meeting in Beijing with pro-China 
businessmen and trade unionists. 
  They questioned the director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office about China's likely response if Hong Kong fell 
into "chaos" in the next three years as a result of the 
political reform proposals of the Governor, Chris Patten. Lu 
would not comment directly on the issue, but said Hong Kong must 
play a complementary and co-ordinated role with the mainland. 
"Hong Kong should not use confrontation or antagonism to repel 
China," he said. "If that happens then I think Hong Kong will 
perish. It will have no hope." 
  Lu said the Communist Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, 
had made the same point when he met the trade unionists earlier 
in the day. Lu's use of the Chinese character "wang," meaning 
literally the collapse of a country, was perhaps the strongest 
wording yet by a Chinese official to threaten Hong Kong. 
  When he visited the territory last month, Lu said Hong Kong 
"would be of negative value instead of positive value to China" 
if pro-democracy forces flourished. He warned then of "chaos 
and disruption" but stopped short of predicting Hong Kong's 
collapse. 
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, 
Cheng Yu-tong, raised the Patten proposals privately with Lu 
after yesterday's meeting. Cheng said Lu's remarks were aimed 
at preserving the long-term stability of Hong Kong. "I agreed 
with him that Hong Kong must not have a confrontational role or 
become some kind of political city," he said. "If all kinds of 
political forces are allowed to take root it will not be good 
for the territory." 
  Lu stressed that in the lead up to the transfer of 
sovereignty in 1997 work on economic issues needed particular 
attention. This would ensure that Hong Kong played its role as 
an economic link to the world for China, which he sees as the 
territory's main value. "Hong Kong's unique advantage is that it 
faces the world with China at its back. If Hong Kong wants to 
make great strides forward, then it should give full play to 
this advantage and co-ordinate with and complement the mainland 
economy," he said. 
  Lu made special comment on the Hong Kong government's 
attempt 
to control property prices. "The effects of most of the 
measures will not be seen until after 1997," he said. The Hong 
Kong government has promised to build between 45,000 and 60,000 
public housing flats in the next six years. Chinese officials 
fear most will be built after the transfer of sovereignty, 
placing a financial burden on the post 1997 government. "We 
need to find ways to control property and land prices to ensure 
a smooth transition and avoid any big fluctuations after 1997." 
Lu compared the property market to a patient with a fever. 
"Bringing down a fever should be done slowly. It would be 
inappropriate to take laxatives to flush it out." 
  The trade unionists will hold a detailed meeting with Lu 
today which is expected to focus on industrial safety at Hong 
Kong-funded factories on the mainland.

  [Text] Senior Chinese official Lu Ping yesterday said he 
saw no major obstacle to ending the seven-year Sino-British 
dispute over the handover of Hong Kong's defence land. Mr Lu, 
director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs 
Office, said he hoped the two sides would reach agreement as 
soon as possible. "I think there is no major obstacle," he said 
in Beijing before meeting a delegation from the Hong Kong 
Chinese Manufacturers' Association. 
  In Hong Kong, leaders of the Joint Liaison Group ended the 
first day of the 16th round of formal negotiations on defence 
land after progress was made in last week's informal meetings. 
British team leader Alan Paul said the informal meetings 
conducted since last Tuesday were "positive" and had succeeded 
in narrowing differences. "Both sides are doing their very best 
to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion as early 
as possible," he said. His Chinese counterpart, Chen Zuo'er, 
said the two sides were making progress. 
  Both refused to give a date for the liaison group's 
forthcoming plenum, expected to be held by the end of the month. 
Last month, both [as published] sides failed to strike a 
long-expected deal on the military land, with China accusing 
Britain of a lack of co- operation. Mr Chen said Britain had 
withheld information which China had demanded for seven years. 
But he did not specify what was wanted. Britain said China had 
raised "new demands" including a request for a bigger naval 
basin and the with holding of one of the 25 military sites it 
had promised to give to the Government for redevelopment.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Beijing: "Lu Ping Emphasizes Hong </F>
Kong's Economic Status and Further Warns Against Becoming a 
Political City"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (TA KUNG PAO),-- Lu Ping, director 
of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office noted 
that Hong Kong should give full play to its favorable conditions 
as a city "with the mainland behind and Southeast Asia in 
front," coordinating and cooperating with the China mainland and 
each supporting the other. In this way Hong Kong will be able 
to ensure its prosperity and stability; otherwise, if Hong Kong 
and the mainland are against each other and confront each other, 
"then, I think, Hong Kong will be finished and will have no 
future!" he said. 
  After saying this he disclosed: "President Jiang Zemin did 
mention this point when he met with the people from the (Hong 
Kong) Federation of Trade Unions recently." 
  Talking about what Hong Kong should do to give full play to 
its own advantages, Lu Ping told a visiting group from the 
Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong: Now Hong Kong 
enjoys a very great advantage, that is, the opportunity offered 
by the development of the cities in mainland China and the 
reform and opening up of the mainland. Hong Kong's position as 
a city "with the mainland behind and Southeast Asia in front" is 
a very big advantage which the three other little dragons of 
Asia do not possess. In addition, as the China mainland is 
carrying on the economic opening up and reform, China's economy 
will be increasingly prosperous. This situation is very 
favorable to Hong Kong. 
  He further pointed out: "In my opinion, therefore, Hong Kong 
should consciously make use of this favorable situation and give 
full play to this advantage. Only in this way can Hong Kong 
retain prosperity." For this reason, "Hong Kong should maintain 
a relationship of mutual support, mutual coordination, and 
mutual cooperation with the China mainland, rather than a 
relationship of confrontation, antagonism, and repulsion. If 
the latter scenario takes place, that is, the relationship 
between Hong Kong and the China mainland becomes a mutually 
repulsive and mutually confrontational one then, I think, Hong 
Kong will be finished and will have no future! President Jiang 
Zemin did mention this point when he met with the people from 
the Federation of Trade Unions today. We hope more Hong Kong 
people will be aware of this." 
  He added that China hopes Hong Kong will be able to keep its 
"economic superiority" and give full play to its economic role. 
He said he does not want to see Hong Kong become a "political 
city." The so-called "political city," he said, means a Hong 
Kong being used to exert political influence on the mainland. 
He reiterated that he did not mean that Hong Kong people should 
be indifferent to politics but that Hong Kong should first of 
all give full play to its economic superiority. 
  He warned that "Hong Kong will have no future if it is 
turned 
into a political city and is used to exert political influence 
on the mainland." He stressed that Hong Kong and the China 
mainland "should maintain a relationship of cooperation and 
mutual support." "Only in this way will Hong Kong be able to 
give full play to its role and be assured of prosperity and 
stability." 
  Commenting on the relationship between Hong Kong and 
Shanghai 
in the 21st century regarding economic development, Lu Ping 
said: The two cities will play their own roles and each will 
make different contributions but they can complement and support 
each other. Therefore, it will not be a case of Shanghai 
replacing Hong Kong. He expressed his hope that Hong Kong 
compatriots would realize that the state is now practicing a 
very, very special policy toward Hong Kong, therefore Hong Kong 
people should give play to their role and make greater 
contributions in this respect. 
  He added that Hong Kong's future role does not lie in its 
limited financial contributions to the state but in its status 
as a window and bridge linking the country with the outside 
world.

0796 3177): "Lu Ping Talks About Hong Kong Flat Prices, Other 
Economic Affairs When Meeting With Hong Kong Manufacturers' 
Delegation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (TA KUNG PAO) -- Today, Lu Ping, 
director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, met with the visiting delegation of the Hong Kong 
Chinese Manufacturers' Association at the Hong Kong and Macao 
Center of Beijing. He said at the meeting that there are only 
three years plus 17 days before the transfer of government in 
1997, but a good deal of things needed to be done to ensure a 
smooth transition. In particular, many issues in the field of 
economic affairs should be considered and solved as soon as 
possible. For example, the issue of property prices, the 
coordination of capital construction between Hong Kong and the 
mainland, the operational costs and charges of the container 
terminal, and the shipping arrangements between Hong Kong and 
the mainland. 
  Lu Ping said: Now, there are only three years plus 17 days 
before the transfer of government in Hong Kong. "When meeting 
the delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, our 
President Jiang said that time flies like an arrow, and the sun 
and the moon move back and forth like a shuttle. Three years 
will pass very quickly, but we are now still facing a great deal 
of preparatory work. Such preparatory work only serves the 
purpose of guaranteeing Hong Kong's smooth transition to the 
period beyond 1997. We hope to achieve this purpose in the 
political, economic, and social aspects." 
  When talking about the issue of flat prices in Hong Kong and 
the Hong Kong Government's recent measures, Lu Ping said: "We 
should have foresight when approaching this issue, and should 
not only look at current prices. Because the measures set forth 
by the British Hong Kong authorities will become effective 
before 1997, we hope that after 1997, a smooth transition will 
be effected for both flat prices and land prices, and no major 
fluctuations will arise." He added that in order to ensure a 
smooth transition, the relevant issues must be submitted to the 
the Sino-British Land Committee and other channels for mutual 
consultation, because these issues are all related to how Hong 
Kong will be able to maintain prosperity after 1997. He said: 
The soaring flat prices have made ordinary people unable to buy 
flats, and this is indeed a big problem which must be solved. 
At the same time, the high flat prices will also raise the 
costs of production and thus weaken the competitive power of 
Hong Kong products. In addition, this may force some overseas 
transnational groups to give up plans for setting up Asian or 
Far East headquarters in Hong Kong, or force some of them to 
move their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong to other 
countries or regions. This will certainly affect Hong Kong's 
status as an international economic, trade, and financial center. 
  Therefore, he stressed, the issue of high property prices 
must be resolved as soon as possible. The Chinese side has also 
long expressed its opinion. It is hope that the British Hong 
Kong authorities will squarely face this problem, and will adopt 
some measures that are really effective. On the other hand, 
however, this issue must be handled prudently. "Like a person 
who has a high fever, the body temperature cannot be lowered 
drastically, but should be cooled down gradually." The real 
estate industry is the pillar of the Hong Kong economy. If 
drastic ups and downs arise, the overall economy in Hong Kong 
will certainly be affected. 
  As for the issue of coordinating the large-scale capital 
construction projects between Hong Kong and the nearby mainland 
areas, Lu Ping said that this will not only affect Hong Kong, 
but will also affect the development of the mainland cities. 
For example, the plans for the construction of railways, 
highways, and shipping terminals on the two sides must be 
properly coordinated. It is impossible that each goes its own 
way. Otherwise, what should be done in the future if the 
projects launched separately on the two sides do not dovetail or 
become incompatible? Lu Ping cited an example and said: At 
present, China is building the Beijing-Jiulong (Kowloon) 
Railway. After the railway line stretches to Shenzhen, where 
should it be extended into Hong Kong, how should the railways 
built on both sides be linked up? In addition, there is a 
shortage of storage facilities along the railway line on the 
Hong Kong side; after the new railway is opened to traffic in 
the future, how will the Hong Kong side handle the suddenly 
increasing freight as well as passengers? The settlement of all 
such issues requires coordination between the two sides. 
  With regard to the construction of the new container 
terminals, Lu Ping said that Hong Kong actually needs to build 
new container terminals, but attention should also be paid to 
the competition from the new container terminals in Shanghai, 
Shenzhen, and Shekou. In particular, operation costs and 
charges of the Hong Kong container terminals are rather high 
now, and this may weaken their competitiveness. Therefore, Lu 
Ping said, if the construction and operation costs of Container 
Terminal Number Nine are not properly brought under control, the 
new terminal will not have competitive power if it is built. 
  As for the shipping arrangements between Hong Kong and the 
mainland, Lu Ping said that it is necessary to consider as soon 
as possible the issue of whether ships registered in Hong Kong 
will be treated as "foreign ships" or "domestic ships" when 
entering mainland harbors after 1997, and how the Chinese ships 
will be treated when entering the harbor of Hong Kong, because 
this is an issue that both sides will be facing as of 1 July 
1997.

<F P=106> [Report by Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The Liberal Party was told its attempt to bring the 
electoral bill closer to the Basic Law would not prevent China 
disbanding the three tiers of government in 1997. The message 
was delivered by Hong Kong co-convener of the Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC) political subgroup, Leung Chun-ying, who 
is in Beijing to discuss an initial report on the formation of 
the first post-1997 legislature and district organisations. 
Political parties' attempts to amend Governor Chris Patten's 
reform proposals had nothing to do with the PWC's work, Mr Leung 
said. 
  The Liberal Party's proposal, to be discussed by the 
Legislative Council on June 29, would retain the original system 
of functional constituencies under which votes are cast by 
corporate members of business organisations. The party also 
seeks to bring the four-sector composition of the election 
committee in line with the Basic Law requirements. 
  The PWC would come up with a proposal which followed the 
Basic Law. 
  In its report, the subgroup will list possible solutions and 
recommendations for the formation of the first legislature and 
district organisations. One of the key features is related to 
the voting method, including the multi-seat single-vote system 
that has been voted down by Legco. Another proposal is for 
proportional representation, which most subgroup members 
preferred. 
  The report will also touch on the smooth transition of the 
civil service, the formation of the first Special Administrative 
Region government, the relationship between the executive and 
legislature, and the setting up of offices in the SAR by 
different levels of the Chinese Government.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy in Beijing and Queenie Wang in Hong Kong] </F>
  [Text] China's Hong Kong-based advisory body, the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), will consider calls to 
change the territory's electoral system from a single-seat, 
single-vote model to proportional representation during its 
plenary session next month. 
  The proposal was put forward by PWC political sub-group 
members at a two-day meeting which ended in Beijing yesterday. 
One delegate, Professor Lau Siu-kai, said members felt 
proportional representation was more appropriate for the 
territory. He said it would preserve the nature of the 
legislature as a watchdog to the Government, with reasonable 
representation from various political groups. Professor Lau 
said the group would discuss various models later in the year. 
  Adoption of a proportional representation system would mean 
voters choosing between political parties rather than individual 
candidates when casting their vote. Seats obtained by each 
party would be in proportion to the percentage of votes they had 
won. 
  The news came as legislators and academics expressed fears 
the Government's voter registration drive was heading for 
disaster. With less than three weeks before the campaign's July 
1 deadline, 1.66 million eligible voters have yet to enroll. 
The situation is even worse among people aged 18 to 21 who will 
be able to vote for the first time in September's district board 
elections following the recent lowering of the voting age. Only 
28 percent, or 56,000, of the 200,000 potential electors have 
enrolled, according to figures released by the Registration and 
Election Office. The two-month campaign has reaped just 340,000 
new voters, marginally increasing the proportion of Hong Kong's 
potential 3.9 million electorate who are registered to 57 
percent, or 2.24 million. 
  The apathy was evident yesterday at a registration drive in 
Kwun Tong. One potential voter said: "I'm not interested in 
politics and I don't believe any of the politicians could 
genuinely represent my interests." A queue of potential 
electors lined up in front of the Telford Gardens registration 
counter in Kowloon Bay yesterday, proved on closer inspection to 
be collecting free balloons given away as part of the drive. 
  The registration campaign has cost $6.6 million. But 
legislator and Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood 
chairman Frederick Fung Kin-kee was shocked by the response. "I 
would have expected at least half of eligible voters between 18 
and 21 to have registered," he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 11 (XINHUA) -- Latest statistics 
from the local government showed that the external trade of the 
territory in the first four months of 1994 had continued booming 
with imports exceeding exports by a margin of 24.3 billion HK 
dollars (roughly three billion U.S. dollars). 
  During the first four months of 1994, the territory had 
exported a total of 333.5 billion HK dollars (approximately 43 
billion U.S. dollars) worth of goods while its total imports 
were valued at 357.8 billion HK dollars (about 46 billion U.S. 
dollars). 
  Comparing with the same period of 1993, the value of the 
territory's imports in the first four months of 1994 had 
increased by 9.5 percent while the value of its re-exports had 
recorded a 13 percent rise to 272.1 billion HK dollars (35 
billion U.S. dollars). 
  However, the value of domestic exports in the first four 
months of this year had witnessed a 7.8 percent drop to 61.4 
billion HK dollars (8 billion U.S. dollars) as compared with the 
corresponding period last year.

  [Text] Kiev, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Ukraine and Russia have 
made some progress on the division of the disputed Black Sea 
Fleet, according to recent reports. 
  Delegations from the two countries made "great improvement" 
in seeking a solution to the Black Sea Fleet issue during their 
latest round of talks in Kiev on June 8 and 9, the UKRAINIAN 
NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  The two sides have reached agreement on a detailed list 
related to the divided fleet, ground equipment along the 
coastline where the fleet is located and equipment in the 
surrounding community. 
  Although they agreed to keep the fleet at its current base 
in 
the port city of Sevastopol on the Crimea Coast, Ukraine and 
Russia still differ on this point. Russia has insisted on full 
control of Sevastopol, while Ukraine proposed that both fleets 
could be based in or near Sevastopol. 
  On May 24 and 25, the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers 
held talks on the fleet but failed to reach agreement as the two 
sides disagreed over the location and terms for basing the two 
fleets.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Xiong Changyi: "More Japanese Investments Pour </F>
In Philippines"] 
  [Text] Manila, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Hitachi poured 2.5 
billion pesos (92.6 million U.S. dollars) in the Philippines to 
build its largest overseas plant in Asia to produce hard-disk 
drives and magnetic heads. 
  Nissan inaugurated its 300 million pesos (11.1 million U.S. 
dollars) worth of press and stamping plant as the first phase of 
its two billion peso (74 million U.S. dollar) Nissan Technopark 
in the country. 
  Toyota will invest some 1.2 billion pesos (44.4 million U.S. 
dollars) to enhance its distribution network in the Philippines 
within two years. 
  Mitsubishi will conduct a three-year expansion program worth 
800 million pesos (29.6 million U.S. dollars) in its local 
subsidiary to double its car production by 1997. 
  With the strong performance of the economy in the first 
quarter, coupled with the ongoing economic restructuring such as 
trade and investment liberalization and the stable political 
situation, more and more Japanese investors are eyeing the 
Philippines. 
  The country's economy grew by 4.84 percent in the first 
three 
months of the year following the resolution of the power crisis 
and the government's bold economic reforms. 
  Economic division director Kazuo Sunaga of the Japanese 
Embassy said today that Japanese investments into the country 
are expected to further increase following the country's much 
improved economic conditions. 
  "I can confidently say Japanese investments will now start 
pouring," he added. 
  He also cited the Philippines' edge over other ASEAN 
countries, noting that Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore are 
already saturated with Japanese investments. 
  Japanese investments in the country amounted to 25.039 
billion pesos (927 million U.S. dollars) since 1988 up to may 
this year followed by the United States with 16.536 billion 
pesos (612 million U.S. dollars).

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column article by Jen Hui-wen </F>
(0117 1979 2429) on 8 June in Beijing: "Strategic Differences 
Within the State Council on the Issue of Returning to GATT"] 
  [Text] China has set two major objectives for its foreign 
trade and economic relations this year. One is to win extension 
of the most-favored-nation status from the United States, and 
the other is to strive to restore China's contracting status in 
GATT (called "returning to GATT" hereafter). At present, the 
first objective has been achieved. As for returning to GATT, 
Tong Zhiguang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation who has represented China to attend the relevant 
talks many times, said in March that China might return to GATT 
by August on the grounds that the planned economic structure, 
which used to be the greatest obstacle to China's return to 
GATT, was no longer a problem after the establishment of the 
socialist market economic system was written into the PRC 
Constitution. Moreover, China has adopted a series of measures 
to reform its foreign trade system. Beginning this year, the 
system of assigning mandatory business quotas was terminated, 
and the system of assigning export quotas and licenses has also 
been replaced with a system of tender invitation. Import duties 
have been gradually lowered, and the overall foreign trade 
system has basically met GATT requirements. China has basically 
built up the framework for returning to GATT. However, in late 
May, Peter Sutherland, GATT director-general, said that it would 
be possible for China to return to GATT by 1 January next year, 
but this would still be an extremely difficult task because the 
decisive power is in the hands of other signatory states to GATT 
and the time for China's return to GATT will be decided 
collectively. 
  China has spent eight years applying for a return to GATT. 
Certain progress was made in this regard, but the process was 
full of twists and turns. The issue thus once again aroused a 
debate inside the State Council. The debate was focused on 
whether China should strive to return to GATT at any costs. 
  According to sources in Beijing, when talking about the 
issue 
of returning to GATT at a meeting of responsible officials in 
late May, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said that China now still 
cannot return to GATT not because China has not made sufficient 
preparations but because the United States is putting up 
obstructions for political reasons; China must not give up the 
principle of "balanced rights and duties" in order to return to 
GATT. He said: "In order to return to GATT, China has done all 
that it should to meet GATT requirements in terms of 
institutional structures and operational regulations. China 
still cannot return to GATT not because China is still short of 
any hard and soft conditions. It is because the United States 
deliberately makes things difficult for China according to its 
political strategy and imposes harsh terms on China. Some West 
European countries also follow the United States. It seems that 
we were too optimistic about returning to GATT in the previous 
period. Now we should more calmly consider this issue, and see 
which measures are unrealistic and out of keeping with our 
national conditions and which measures may expose our country to 
unnecessary impact after returning to GATT. We should be better 
aware of all this and make corrections in order to prevent 
losses we should not incur. 
  Zou Jiahua, another vice premier of the State Council, also 
pointed out that although it is still necessary to create 
conditions for returning to GATT at an early date, we cannot and 
also should not make any promise we cannot fulfill at the 
current stage; still less can we behave like a supplicant 
begging for favors. He said that according to what he learned 
from his visit to the United States in May, after returning to 
GATT, China's machine-building, car-making, textile, and 
food-processing industries may be facing new difficulties, so 
they should take sufficient precautions and countermeasures 
against the unfavorable factors. 
  Some people in economic and trade circles in Beijing said 
that in the process of returning to GATT, China must seek the 
common point (or compromise point) between the demands of 
existing GATT contracting parties and China's acceptability 
degree. The remarks of the two vice premiers, Li Lanqing and 
Zou Jiahua, show that China would, as usual, continue to adhere 
to the principle of "balanced rights and duties," and would 
never pay any costs in exchange for the return to GATT. If 
other contracting parities set forth unusual, discriminatory, 
and harsh terms for China's return to GATT, China will certainly 
make no compromise and adhere to its own position. In reality, 
the process of China's return to GATT is contingent on the 
political environment more than on the negotiations. When China 
clearly sees the other side's demands, it will come to 
understand that it cannot be overanxious for a quick result and 
should only try to gradually knock open the door for the return 
to GATT through making steady progress. 
  According to sources, Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing 
Committee and the CPC Central Political Bureau and also vice 
premier of the State Council, held that China should still 
actively create conditions for returning to GATT. In early 
March, Zhu Rongji instructed Chen Jinhua, minister of the State 
Planning Commission, Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, and Wu Yi, minister of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, to jointly draft an outline 
about the main problems and measures for China's return to GATT 
in 1994 in order to submit the outline to the State Council for 
deliberation after the end of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress. 
  Zhu Rongji's main viewpoint 
was: The return to GATT will provide more favorable conditions 
for China's across-the-board opening and involvement in fair and 
free trade and business competition, and this will also remove 
the political obstacles set by the United States and Western 
Europe to China's foreign trade. Moreover, the cost of 
returning to GATT within this year will be smaller than that in 
two or three years. Therefore, China should continue to strive 
to return to GATT at an early date. For this purpose, China may 
now act according to GATT rules, and should overcome 
difficulties in adapting domestic systems to them. In order to 
return to GATT, China may first make certain compromises. The 
concessions will serve the purpose of gaining greater benefit. 
  According to sources, Zhu Rongji's opinion on returning to 
GATT as soon as possible was supported by CPC General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, who is also a member of the 
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Political Bureau, and was 
also supported by many experts in GATT affairs. 
  In Beijing, an expert in GATT affairs said that Zhu Rongji's 
idea was reasonable. If China makes certain concessions and 
carries out reforms in certain fields where conditions are not 
ripe enough for the purpose of returning to GATT, this will 
force the United States to show its hand on the issue of China's 
return to GATT. China will then be able to know its real 
intention, and will adjust its industrial structure and better 
orient its reforms in the fields of foreign trade and customs 
tariff to the world practice. Thus, even if China cannot return 
to GATT within this year, it will have better internal 
conditions for returning to GATT next year. It will then be 
more difficult for the United States and its Western followers 
to find any excuses. 
  As for the United States using political factors to make 
things more difficult for China, the expert said this was a 
bargaining tactic that the United States would certainly use. 
If China is too inflexible and thus enables Taiwan to be 
admitted to GATT ahead of China, then the political factors will 
become more complicated. 
  China may be facing the impact of its return to GATT in 
various realms. For example, the growth rate of the national 
economy may be slowed down, basic industries may be affected, 
the number of jobless people may increase, China's renminbi 
currency may be further devalued, and the shortage of foreign 
exchange worsen. The expert said that one should not overreact 
to such problems, because they will also appear even if China 
postpones its return to GATT one or two years. It is better 
that the pains come earlier than later. China may promote its 
reform and development through the return to GATT. 
  The expert stressed that precisely proceeding from such 
strategic considerations, China announced the termination of 
issuing import licenses and quotas to 195 commodities on 25 May 
after it announced the termination of import control over 283 
commodities. This not only showed China's sincerity for 
returning to GATT, but also pushed Chinese enterprises to the 
forefront of the international competition. China will have a 
stronger bargaining position in the talks on its return to GATT. 
If the United States allows China to return to GATT earlier, 
China may lower the tariffs earlier; on the contrary, China's 
tariffs will not be lowered and the American goods will find it 
hard to enter the Chinese market. 
  The expert added: China's relations with GATT and the future 
World Trade Organization are two-way relations. That is, China 
needs them, and they also need China. China can now survive 
without the support of the world's free trade organization. In 
such circumstances, if the United States does not make positive 
responses and adopt a realistic approach, it will certainly be 
facing heavy pressure from American business circles and be 
asking for trouble.

  [Text] Geneva, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Peter Sutherland, 
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), today urged the acceleration of talks on China's 
re-entry into the world trade body in the next few months. 
  During a meeting with a Chinese trade official here, 
Sutherland said that "positive" and "constructive" changes have 
taken place in the negotiations on the re-entry and the momentum 
should be kept. 
  The 112-member GATT will be part of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) after the agreement on the Uruguay Round 
trade talks takes effect in early 1995. 
  All the GATT members will certainly be WTO members while 
those who are not in GATT before the date when WTO is set up 
will have to apply for WTO membership. 
  In his meeting with Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese 
delegation to negotiations with the European Union (EU) and the 
United States, Sutherland expressed his hope that all the sides 
show biggest flexibility, stressing that there should be further 
progress in talks on services. 
  The meeting took place after the Chinese delegation finished 
a round of talks with the U.S. and the EU on the resumption of 
China's status in GATT. 
  Long, also an assistant to Chinese Foreign Trade and 
Economic 
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, briefed the GATT chief on Sino-U.S. 
and Sino-EU negotiations.

  [Text] Maputo, June 12 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Government will 
persuade President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique to accept the 
proposal put forward by the Mozambique National Resistance 
(Renamo) for a government of national unity after the elections, 
said Renamo leader in Washington. 
  According to the local newspaper "SUNDAY" today, Renamo 
leader Afonso Dhlakama [name as received] said this before 
winding up his visit to the United States. 
  He said the U.S. Government is preparing to make President 
Chissano see the significance of establishing such a government 
in Mozambique after the elections in coming October. 
  During his visit to the U.S., which began early this month, 
Dhlakama also held meetings in New York with U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and some representatives 
from member states of the U.N. Security Council. He said that 
they are also for the proposal. 
  Meanwhile, Dhlakama said the U.S. Government has decided to 
provide one million U.S. dollars to help enlarge the Renamo 
guerrilla force into a political party.

  [Text] Khartoum, June 13 ( XINHUA ) -- Melissa F. Wells, 
special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton, said she will meet 
with the rebel movement in Sudan in a bid to bring about a 
cease-fire in the southern part. 
  Following a meeting here today with Ali al-Haj [Mohamed], 
Sudanese minister of state in the Federal Government Chamber, 
Wells said her role concentrates on arranging a cease fire 
between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation 
Army (SPLA), Sudanese radio reported today. 
  The Sudanese minister said his government is ready to accept 
a cease fire if sincere and earnest steps are taken by the rebel 
side despite advances made by government troops on the battle 
ground. 
  Al-Haj asserted to the U.S. presidential envoy the lack of 
seriousness on the part of the rebel movement to negotiate 
peace, citing the delay of the rebel delegation to appear at the 
recent round of peace negotiations held in Nairobi. 
  He also praised the initiative made by the 
Inter-Governmental 
Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) and its 
constructive role towards reaching peace in south Sudan. 
  The U.S. envoy arrived here last Saturday to push forward 
the 
peace efforts made by the IGADD, which groups Kenya, Uganda, 
Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan. 
  Sudan, which has a population of about 25 million, is split 
by conflicts between the Moslem-dominated government in the 
north and the Animist and Christian Church. 
  The SPLA led by John Garang has been fighting against the 
government since 1983, seeking more economic reforms in the 
south.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said today that U.S. hoped to resolve 
regional conflicts through peaceful means. 
  Speaking at the ongoing ministerial meeting of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) held here, Christopher said 
that "We face the most destructive conflict in Europe since the 
Second World War. We have seen violence in the Caucasus and in 
Central Asia." 
  On the Bosnian conflict, Christopher said the U.S. believes 
that the steps agreed at the Geneva ministerial meeting last 
month offer the best chance for a resolution to that "horrible 
conflict." 
  Fighting broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in February of 1992 
when Moslems and Croats, about 80 percent of the 4.3 million 
population in the former Yugoslavia Republic, voted for 
independence from Belgrade. Thousands of people have been 
killed in the fighting. 
  NATO foreign ministers threw their weight Thursday [9 June] 
behind an effort to impose a territorial solution on the Bosnian 
conflict and reaffirmed their readiness to send a peacekeeping 
force once the warring parties sign an accord. 
  The 16 alliance members welcomed a one-month truce among the 
warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems, scheduled to take effect 
today, as a "positive first step." 
  They urged that the cease-fire should be expanded to include 
the separation of the combatants, the use of United Nations 
Forces to ensure the truce and the withdrawal of all heavy 
weapons. 
  The U.S. secretary of state said there were also potential 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, especially Ipdjina, Kosovo, 
and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
  "They must be resolved to avoid a wider conflict in the 
region," said Christopher. 
  He said that "in the former Soviet Union, the United States 
has worked with all the parties to keep disagreements from 
erupting into violence." 
  "European stability depends on all countries' respecting of 
the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all 
the states that emerged from the Soviet Empire," he noted. 
  Christopher held talks today with his Russian counterpart 
Andrey Kozyrev on the U.S.-Russian relation and strengthening of 
the cooperation between NATO and Russia. 
  In a joint press conference following the talks, Christopher 
said that U.S. welcomes Russia's signature of the Partnership 
for Peace in the near future. 
  Forty-one foreign ministers from the NACC and former East 
Bloc countries are attending the meeting.

  [Text] Istanbul, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers or 
their representatives from 41 countries today called on the 
world to fully implement all the existing arms control and 
disarmament agreements. 
  In a statement released at the end of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council (NACC) meeting, the participants agreed that 
they will continue their supports to the CFE (Conventional Armed 
Forces in Europe) Treaty as a corner-stone of European security 
and stability. 
  They also urged an "early entry into force of the Convention 
on Chemical Weapons." 
  They asked all states to fully implement the "Biological and 
Toxin Weapons Convention and to strengthen it." 
  The statement also called for an early entry into force of 
the Treaty on Open Skies and increased transparency on 
conventional arms transfers. 
  The participants called for an early conclusion of a 
universal and effectively verifiable comprehensive test ban 
treaty. 
  In the nuclear field, the ministers "welcome the trilateral 
statement signed by Presidents Bill Clinton (of the U.S.), 
Leonid Kravchuk (of Ukraine) and Boris Yeltsin (of Russia) in 
Moscow on 14 January on the transfer of all nuclear warheads in 
Ukraine to Russia for dismantlement." 
  During the one-day meeting the ministers and representatives 
of the 41 countries also discussed the regional conflicts which 
could lead to unstability in the region. 
  On the Bosnian conflict, the meeting urged the "parties 
concerned to conclude the comprehensive cessation of hostilities 
and negotiate an early and durable settlement of the conflict." 
  The meeting, which was chaired by Sergio Baganzino, deputy 
secretary-general of the NATO, decided to hold next NACC meeting 
in Brussels in December this year.

  [Text] Beirut, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Lebanon has expressed 
grievances for the U.S. opposition to the efforts to call a U.N. 
Security Council meeting to discuss its complaints against 
Israel, leading the council's failure to take any measure to 
denounce Israel. 
  Local press reported the Lebanese permanent representative 
to 
the U.N. said in a statement that "Because of one of the 
Security Council permanent members which hindered any step to 
condemn Israel or denounce its aggressions on Lebanon, the 
Security Council has refrained from declaring it was against the 
violations of the international law and the basic human rights." 
He was referring to the United States. 
  The representative said the Lebanese requests were 
understood 
and supported by most of the 15 members of the U.N. Security 
Council, but "after more than two weeks of consultations (since 
Lebanon lodged its first complaint) the Security Council did not 
take any measure." 
  The statement added that the failure to condemn Israel could 
only lead to "encourage Israel to believe that it is above the 
law and it is absolutely free to commit other violations against 
Lebanon and its citizens." 
  Lebanon filed its first complaint to the U.N. Security 
Council against Israel following an Israeli Commando raid deep 
into Lebanon on May 21 in which Israeli Air-Borne Troops 
abducted Lebanese guerrilla leader Mustafa Dirani. 
  The second Lebanese complaint was lodged after Israeli 
warplanes attacked a training camp of the Lebanese pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon 
and more than 100 people were reportedly killed or wounded in 
the air raid. 
  Lebanon held intensive contacts with the member states of 
the 
U.N. Security Council in order to push it to condemn the 
repeated Israeli aggressions. 
  The opposition of the United States for a Security Council 
meeting to debate the Israeli aggression on Lebanon has aroused 
criticism in Lebanon. 
  Local press accused the United States of standing behind the 
Israeli aggressions in order to press Lebanon and Syria to give 
up their firm positions in the peace negotiations with Israel.

  [Text] Washington, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. State 
Department said today it has ordered the departure of U.S. 
Embassy dependents and some Embassy employees from Haiti and 
urged all private U.S. citizens in Haiti to leave as soon as 
possible. 
  "We are advising Americans not engaged in essential 
diplomatic or humanitarian work and to depart Haiti as early as 
possible," Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told 
reporters at a regular news briefing. 
  "The political situation in Haiti remains unstable with 
potential throughout the country for random violence, sporadic 
disturbances and criminal acts," she said. 
  Shelly also issued a new travel warning on Haiti, saying 
that 
"U.S. citizens are warned against travel to Haiti" because of 
the suspension of the commercial air passenger service. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton announced earlier today a ban on 
commercial air traffic between the United States and Haiti, 
which will take effect as of June 25 in order to allow those 
Americans who wish to leave Haiti to do so. 
  "U.S. citizens should make arrangements to leave as early as 
possible as airline seating may be limited," Shelly said. 
  She told reporters that about 120 Americans at the U.S. 
Embassy would be departing and approximately 80 would remain to 
provide services to American citizens, to continue refugee 
processing and to report on the situation in Haiti.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- China today unveiled a 
bio-diversity action plan, to implement the 1992 Rio de Janeiro 
biological diversity convention, of which China was a signatory. 
  The plan was drawn up by the State Environment Protection 
Agency (EPA), the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of 
Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, other ministries and the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
  It is the first national bio-diversity protection plan aided 
by the Global Environment Fund. 
  Bio-diversity, including animals, plants and 
micro-organisms, 
refers to ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic 
diversity. 
  Xie Zhenhua, director-general of EPA, said that sustainable 
development is at the core of China's strategy to conserve 
bio-diversity. 
  The strategy -- a sustainable use of living things and a 
guarantee of a healthy cycle for the ecosystem -- is expected to 
help create sound material and environmental conditions for a 
sustainable development of the national economy and the whole 
society. 
  He said that China would soon take some specific measures to 
ensure the fulfilment of the overall bio-diversity protection 
plan. 
  China would first decide which places and species need the 
most urgent protection, set up a monitoring system and 
information centers on bio-diversity, launch experimental 
projects to return artificially-bred species to nature, 
introduce a bio-diversity appraisal system, establish special 
funds for bio-diversity protection and expand international 
cooperation in this sphere. 
  Song Jian, state councillor and minister of the State 
Science 
and Technology Commission, noted that currently bio-diversity is 
seriously endangered by cutting and burning trees on a large 
scale, improperly reclaiming grasslands and wetlands, 
over-hunting of wild animals and over-gathering of wild plants, 
inappropriate use of pesticides, destructive fishing and 
environmental pollution. 
  "Bio-diversity has become a priority global environmental 
issue and the loss of bio-diversity is threatening people's life 
and development," he warned. 
  He said China is one of the dozen "mega-diversity" countries 
in the world. It has some 2,340 kinds of land vertebrates, or 
10 percent of the world's total, and more than 300,000 species 
of flora, which ranks it third in the world. 
  "In view of these facts, bio-diversity conservation in China 
is of great international significance," Song stressed. 
  The Chinese Government has been consistent in its efforts to 
protect the eco-environment while developing its economy and 
eliminating poverty, he said. 
  He added that the newly-launched action plan, a set of 
guidelines for bio-diversity conservation throughout China, will 
prove to be of great value in getting the whole of society to 
conserve the unique, rich and varied bio-diversity of China. 
  Xie said that the painstaking efforts made by the 
departments 
involved have begun to yield results. He recalled that China 
has since 1956 established more than 760 nature reserves, and 
the protected area now amounts to 6.8 percent of the country's 
entire territory. 
  He also said that China now has 110 botanical gardens, over 
40 zoos, 26 breeding centers for endangered animals and more 
than 230 farms for rare and precious animals. 
  Today's conference to launch the bio-diversity action plan 
for China was attended by more than 400 government officials, 
experts, foreign ambassadors to China and representatives from 
the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Environment Program and 
the World Bank.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said here Monday [13 June] that his country is 
unable to participate in military missions around the world. 
  At a meeting of the committee for budget attached to the 
House of Councillors, Hata said that Japan can only take actions 
within the framework of the Constitution, including such 
activities as backup support and mine-sweeping during the Gulf 
war. 
  "It is very difficult for Japan to cooperate with the United 
States in the military aspect of possible sanctions against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea," the prime minister said 
while referring to the nuclear dispute on the Korean peninsula. 
  Before the routine meeting of the committee for budget, both 
the Japanese prime minister and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
said Japan should keep in close touch with the United States, 
South Korea and China to strive for a peaceful settlement on the 
nuclear dispute in the Korean peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, measures put forward at the U.N. Security Council 
concerning the issue should be carried out step by step, they 
said.

vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress (NPC), said here today that the general framework of 
China's reforms and opening to the outside world will remain 
unchanged. 
  He noted that there are no changes in policies to encourage 
overseas investment formulated by the Chinese Government in the 
past decade. 
  Tian made the remark during his recent inspection of east 
China's Fujian Province upon learning that some overseas 
businessmen are now worrying about the stability of China's 
policies and society. 
  Tian said that China's society is stable and he expects 
overseas investors to go ahead with business plans in China. 
  The vice-chairman also stressed the development of 
agriculture. 
  He urged Fujian to increase the income of farmers while 
promoting grain production and developing a diversified economy 
in rural areas. 
  He stressed the development of rural industry, private 
enterprises and individual commerce. 
  He said that the growth of rural industry and 
overseas-funded 
enterprises can be the motive power behind the development of 
state enterprises. 
  He said that the development of a market economy calls for 
encouraging the development of diversified economic elements.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
today congratulated the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on 
its 30th summit which opened today in Tunis. 
  In a message sent to the summit, Li Peng said the birth of 
new South Africa signified the victory accomplished by the OAU 
and all African people in the political field. 
  But Li also expressed the concern over the on-going 
conflicts 
in some African countries, in particular Rwanda. 
  "Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in 
Rwanda 
in particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the 
economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the 
international community," said Li. 
  "We firmly support the OAU in its vigorous efforts to 
mediate 
in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain political and 
social stability in African countries," he added. 
  While wishing the summit a complete success, the premier 
said 
to enhance friendly relations and cooperation with Africa "has 
all along been part and parcel of the foreign policy of the 
Chinese Government."

  [Text] Chengdu, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Tens of thousands of 
migrant laborers in the rural areas of southwest China's Sichuan 
Province have now become bosses in various forms of business. 
  According to the Sichuan Rural Labor Management Department, 
Sichuan has 5 million migrant laborers all over the country and 
last year the income from labor services in Sichuan reached 
about 10 billion yuan. 
  An official of the department said that the number of 
self-employed households and private enterprises totals more 
than 1.6 million. 
  About 10 percent of the bosses of these businesses are 
former 
migrant laborers. 
  In recent years, many of the migrant laborers applied their 
experience and technology gained from their labor services in 
other provinces, even in foreign countries, to economic 
development in their home villages. 
  They opened their own businesses and served as "managers", 
"directors" and even "chairmen of the board of directors". 
  Ma Zhizhen, director of a cement packaging factory in 
Pengshan County, was once a baby-sitter in Chengdu city. She 
collected all her savings from her work and set up her factory 
in the early 1990s. 
  With the rapid growth of the profits and fixed assets of her 
factory, in 1992, she jointly set up a rubber products company 
with a Hong Kong investment firm and hired over 200 laborers in 
her village. 
  Last year, the profits and taxes of Ma's new factory reached 
more than 2 million yuan. 
  In Tiangong Township of Langzhong city in northern Sichuan, 
a 
forest park was recently set up along the dike of the Jialing 
River by a young farmer named Zhao Xiaorong. 
  The 28-year-old Zhao collected more than 1.2 million yuan 
for 
the project, which also has holiday accommodations. 
  Now the park has opened to the public with swimming pools, 
entertainment facilities, traditional-style tea rooms and a 
tavern. 
  Zhao worked in Shenzhen city for a decade before 1992. 
  "The migrant labor brought me opportunities to make money 
and 
gain skill in management," he said. 
  In Guang'an County, Liu Yanlin, a 29-year-old millionaire, 
built his fortune from being a migrant laborer in Shenzhen and 
Henan in the past decade. 
  He now manages Chuanhui Hotel in Huizhou city, Guangdong 
Province, and his annual taxes to the state exceed 100,000 yuan. 
  He has donated more than 1 million yuan to the primary and 
middle schools in his hometown.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472) and Zhang Yi (1728 </F>
5065): "Li Qiyan, Mayor of Beijing Municipality, Investigates 
the Electronics Industrial Trade for the Third Time"] 
  [Excerpts] On 2 June, Mayor Li Qiyan went to Beijing 
broadcasting equipment plant to conduct investigations and 
study. It was the third time for him to investigate the 
electronics industrial trade. He pointed out: The electronics 
industry conforms to the special characteristics of Beijing. 
Thus, the municipal government should vigorously support the 
development of the electronics industry. Enterprises should 
have accurate ideas, foster lofty ideals, enhance internal 
strength, and strive to make the electronics industry become 
Beijing's pillar industry. 
  Li Qiyan and other leaders inspected this plant's 
videocorder 
production line, general outfitting workshop, and showroom; 
cordially talked with workers and technicians; and asked them 
about the production, technical, and marketing situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  Li Qiyan said during the talks: As the capital of a country 
with a population of 1.1 billion, Beijing, under certain 
conditions, should make faster development and stride forward 
toward the orientation of building itself into an 
internationally large, modern city. Beijing should bring its 
role as a political and cultural center into better play. To 
develop the economy, Beijing should develop high technology as 
well as products without contamination and with less energy 
consumption so as to suit the special characteristics of the 
capital. The electronics industry, conforming to the special 
characteristics of Beijing and being listed as one of the 
municipality's three major pillar industries, will become 
increasingly important in the future. 
  Li Qiyan said: Beijing has the conditions for developing the 
electronics industry. Beijing's electronics industrial trade, 
with a good foundation, made great contributions to the country 
in the past. This trade has a comparatively powerful science 
professional and technician contingent and an appropriate 
equipment foundation. In particular, plant directors and the 
broad masses of staff members and workers have a good attitude. 
With confidence and prospects, the leading body of the 
municipal electronics industrial office is able to undertake the 
task for rejuvenating the electronics trade. We should stand 
higher, widen the field of vision, foster higher aspirations, 
and make Beijing's electronics industry stand among the best in 
the country and march toward the world. We should use this 
target to encourage the leading bodies and the staff and workers. 
  Li Qiyan stressed: The key to tiding over the electronics 
industry's difficulties and rejuvenating the electronics 
industry is to have accurate ideas. We should further 
emancipate the mind and change ideas. Targets should be higher 
and attainable. In the next one or two years, we should 
specifically make efforts, do solid work, and solve the problems 
one after another. We should treat the money-losing enterprises 
by looking into both their root causes and symptoms and make 
real efforts to resolve their problems. It is not easy to 
eliminate the root causes of the problems. To eliminate them, 
we must make several years of effort. We should also pay firm 
attention to eliminating the symptoms and appropriately solve 
the problems related to the livelihood of the staff and workers. 
  Li Qiyan said: The transition from the planned economy to 
the market economy is a great transformation. So, it is 
impossible to smoothly realize this transition. There will be 
enterprises with vitality and ones with deficits through this 
transition. The municipal government and various overall 
departments should help enterprises overcome difficulties and 
solve problems, and push enterprises to markets. We should 
vigorously help rejuvenate the electronics industry, try every 
possible means to create a good environment, appropriately 
provide preferential policies, properly inject working funds to 
the production enterprises with markets and efficiency, and give 
them necessary assistance. We should give awards to the plant 
directors with good performances and the specialists with 
contributions so as to bring into play the functions of 
intellectuals. Enterprises should have good leading bodies 
unite with the science professional and technician contingents 
and guide all staff members and workers. Simultaneously, the 
electronics industry should make efforts, work hard to enhance 
its internal strength, and make itself actually become Beijing's 
pillar industry. 
  Li Runwu, vice mayor of the municipality; and Fan Yuanmo, 
secretary general of the municipal government, joined the 
investigation and study activities.

<F P=106> [By Correspondent Dong Shengju (5516 0524 3515) and Reporter </F>
Xiao Shuangsheng (5135 7175 0524): "Enhance Confidence and 
Advance Steadily--Wan Guoqing (8001 0948 1987), Governor of 
Hebei's People's Bank of China, Speaks on Reform of the Banking 
System" -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] How should we implement the principles for banking 
work to steadily promote the reform of the banking system? We 
recently conducted an interview with Wang Guoqing, governor of 
the provincial People's Bank of China, on this question. 
  Wang Guoqing said: In line with the guidelines of the third 
plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, the State 
Council defined the targets of the reform of the banking system 
as establishing a macro-regulation and control system of the 
central bank which is placed under State Council leadership and 
which implements the monetary policy independently; establishing 
a banking organizational system under which policy-lending 
business is separated from commercial banking and which takes 
state-owned commercial banks as the mainstay and allows the 
coexistence of diverse monetary institutions; and establishing a 
unified and open network of money markets which advocate orderly 
competition and are strictly managed. This is a complicated 
system engineering project of society, involving not only 
macroeconomic regulation and control but also microeconomic 
operation. We should implement it in an active and yet prudent 
manner. 
  Speaking on the problems we have encountered in the process 
to attain the targets of the reform of the banking system, Wan 
Guoqing said: We are faced with a rare opportunity for our 
reform and development. We should seize this opportunity to 
promote reform with a firm confidence. We should also note, 
however, that the deep-seated contradictions that bring about 
loss of control of the total amount of credit and serious 
inflation have yet to be fundamentally resolved; that effective 
mechanisms for restraint and mechanisms for risk-taking have yet 
to be established by monetary institutions; and that the tasks 
to rectify the banking order have yet to be fulfilled. These 
are the unfavorable factors affecting the reform of the banking 
system. 
  In view of this, Wan Guoqing urged: Hebei's banking 
departments should conscientiously implement the principles for 
banking work for this year, carry out the various reform 
measures in line with the unified arrangements of the state, and 
comprehensively fulfill the tasks of banking work. In 
particular, we should achieve success in the following work: 
  First, we should continue to rectify the banking order to 
provide a good environment for the reform of the banking system. 
We should continuously expand the achievements on the basis of 
last year's rectification work. Monetary institutions of 
various categories and at various levels should make continuous 
efforts to clean up and collect all loans in violation of 
regulations, correct the business activities in violation of 
regulations, thoroughly separate themselves from the economic 
entities they have established, and solve their own problems in 
an all-round manner. We should continue to investigate and deal 
with all illegal monetary institutions and the illegal banking 
business and illegal collection of funds by nonmonetary 
institutions to safeguard a steady banking order in society. 
  Second, we should bring the total amount of credit under 
strict control to ensure the smooth progress of the reform of 
the banking system. To bring the total amount of credit under 
strict control in the process of changing the old banking system 
to the new and avoid serious inflation is a need of the reform 
of the banking system and also a need in establishing the 
socialist market economy system. We must make it successful 
this year. In line with relevant state stipulations, monetary 
institutions of various categories and at various levels should 
phase in the method of management of the proportions of assets 
and liabilities under the guidance of quotas and try to use 
economic means to control the scope of loans. The method of 
management of the scope of fixed asset loans should be strictly 
carried out, and the scope must never be exceeded without 
approval. Conscientious efforts should be made to enliven the 
use of the loans available, tap the potential of funds, and 
raise more funds to support economic construction. 
  Third, we should steadily promote the reform of the banking 
system and actively do a good job in the various preparations. 
The People's Bank of China, the various specialized banks, and 
other monetary institutions should make various preparations 
according to the unified arrangements of the state. 1) They 
should change concepts and consider issues from the viewpoints 
of the central bank and commercial bank. 2) They should 
strengthen their internal management and improve rules and 
systems to lay a solid foundation for reform. 3) They should do 
a good job in the calculation and analysis of date and other 
relevant report work so that they can implement reform measures 
as soon as possible. 4) They should conscientiously organize 
staff members and workers to study relevant policy regulations 
and intensify their training so that everyone will know 
regulations and how to operate. 
  Fourth, we should conscientiously strengthen banking 
supervision and management and conduct the reform of the banking 
system according to law. People's banks of China at various 
levels should earnestly change their functions and strengthen 
banking supervision and management. When banking laws and rules 
are promulgated, we should step up efforts to formulate the 
detailed regulations for their enforcement and standards for 
operation. People's banks of China and various monetary 
institutions should learn to use laws as a weapon to safeguard 
the safe and effective operation of the banking system, ensure 
public interests, and defend social stability. 
  Fifth, we should "attach equal importance to two tasks" and 
successfully build the infrastructure for the banking 
departments. Realistic improvement of the contingents of staff 
members and workers and strengthening of various fundamental 
work are the basic prerequisites for fulfillment of the tasks of 
the reform of the banking system. Focusing on this year's work 
stress, Hebei's banking departments should "attach equal 
importance to two tasks" and win achievements both in the 
material civilization and the spiritual civilization. 
Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China and all monetary 
institutions should do a good job in accounting, joint final 
accounts, cash receipt and payment, fund distribution, foreign 
exchange control, and business and security to lay a solid 
foundation for the reform of the banking system.

<F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China's President Jiang Zemin has stressed that 
patriotism is essential for maintaining stability in Hong Kong 
in the transitional period and has warned that confrontation 
could cost the territory its future. Mr Jiang met a 20-strong 
delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) in 
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday. He told the 
local unionists that it was now very important for Hong Kong 
people to unite closely to cope with transitional matters. Mr 
Jiang stressed that Hong Kong people should love China and avoid 
confrontational action. 
  FTU chairman Cheng Yiutong said the president urged the 
unionists to do more work in Hong Kong in uniting those who were 
willing to be loyal to China. 
  Mr Jiang was quoted as saying that achieving stability in 
transition was a big issue. He offered a formula for the 
British colony with its history of more than a hundred years 
rule--that it should uphold patriotism toward its original 
motherland. To love China and Hong Kong were key matters. And 
it was especially important to love China to affect a smooth 
transition, he was quoted as saying. It would not be a problem 
for Hong Kong people to love the territory, Mr Jiang said. But 
loving China was quite a different matter for many Hong Kong 
people, for the historical reason that Hong Kong had been 
separated from China for about 150 years. 
  The Chinese leader called for an improved understanding of 
China by Hong Kong people. He said this was a good way to 
strengthen the ideology of patriotism in the territory. He said 
more communication between China and Hong Kong would be 
necessary for this. Uniting Hong Kong people under a banner of 
patriotism could guarantee stability and a smooth transition, Mr 
Jiang said. 
  He told the unionists that the Chinese position on Hong Kong 
was that the key to the territory's prosperity lay on the 
mainland. Hong Kong had to co-operate with China, and good 
coordination between the two systems was vital. He stressed 
that Hong Kong must not take a confrontational attitude to China 
or reject China. He told the local delegation that Hong Kong 
would come to an end without any future if it took the latter 
attitude. Mr Jiang said the policy of "one country, two 
systems" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong after it 
reverted to Chinese control in 1997 should not be doubted. This 
was the central government's fixed policy on the territory, he 
said.

  [Text] During his meeting with Taku Yamasaki, former 
director general of the Defense Agency, and other opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers who are on a visit to China, 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that the 
10 June sanctions imposed by the IAEA against North Korea have 
resulted in the present situation; and he stressed the 
importance of resuming high-level talks between the United 
States and North Korea to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue 
through dialogue. 
  During the meeting, the Chinese vice minister also said: 
What is important is to keep North Korea from withdrawing from 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; the situation surrounding 
the North Korean nuclear issue has now reached a breaking point. 
If U.S.-North Korean high-level talks are resumed, it will be 
possible to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. All nations 
involved need to urge both the United States and North Korea to 
resume high-level talks. In this way, he stressed the 
importance of resuming U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. 
  According to the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan 
delegation, which is now visiting Pyongyang, North Korea has 
voiced strong discontent with moves by the United States and 
other nations to impose sanctions against it. It also has 
insisted that efforts be made to look for a way to resume 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks since there is no longer a 
channel for dialogue with the IAEA.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam exchanged views with former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter here Tuesday [14 June] evening on the nuclear issue of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Carter arrived here Monday in a prelude to his visit to the 
DPRK with the possibility of his mediation in the nuclear 
problem. 
  During the talks over dinner which lasted two and half an 
hours, President Kim said that the nuclear issue has reached "a 
critical stage" due to Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  On Monday, the DPRK announced that it will immediately quit 
the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, and accept no 
more IAEA inspections of its nuclear program. 
  Kim explained to Carter about the South Korean Government's 
firm stance toward the nuclear issue, a source said. 
  The source said that Kim asked Carter to convey Seoul's 
concern and position with regard to the DPRK's IAEA withdrawal. 
  Carter was said to have explained to Kim about the purpose 
of 
his visit to the DPRK and promised to relay Seoul's position to 
Pyongyang correctly. 
  The former U.S. President will pass through the 
heavily-fortified truce village of Panmunjom into the DPRK on 
Wednesday morning and is expected to meet DPRK leader Kim 
Il-song. 
  Carter will return to Seoul on June 18 via Panmunjom and 
meet 
again with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam before heading 
back to Washington. 
  Carter came here at a time when the U.S., South Korea and 
Japan are seeking United Nations sanctions against the DPRK. 
  Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is strictly 
peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to 
accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war. 
  Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula 
would be private. "My hope is to discuss some of the important 
issues of the day with leaders of the area," he added. 
  The former U.S. president has been active in resolving 
conflicts in Panama, Nicaragua and Sudan, among others.

  [Text] Washington, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) notified the United States 
today that it was withdrawing from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam faxed his country's 
notice of leaving the IAEA to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, a senior U.S. official said. 
  Under the IAEA statute, states may withdraw from the IAEA by 
actually notifying the United States Government, because the 
U.S. Government is the depository state for instruments of IAEA 
membership. 
  The senior U.S. official said Kim told Christopher that 
would 
leave international inspectors with nothing to do in the DPRK. 
  The official commented that the U.S. administration would 
have to do something about it and take an accelerated approach 
to sanctions against the DPRK.

  [Text] Washington, June 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. State Secretary 
Warren Christopher called Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev today to discuss the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) nuclear issues. 
  President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
also had a discussion about DPRK by telephone last night. 
  The two foreign ministers at the instructions of the 
presidents followed up on that conversation today, said Mike 
McCurry, State Department spokesman, at a regular news briefing. 
  Christopher and Kozyrev "obviously discussed Korea at some 
length, and particularly the announcement by North Korea 
yesterday concerning its status in the International Atomic 
Energy Agency," McCurry said. 
  Both of them "agreed that announcement was most serious," he 
said, "They agreed that they would continue their very close 
consultations on addressing this issue through our 
representatives at the United Nations." 
  Christopher also discussed the DPRK issue last night in a 
phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, McCurry 
disclosed. They had "very productive consultations" on the 
issue, he added. 
  In addition, Christopher and Kozyrev talked about the 
Partnership for Peace and Russia's impending decision or 
agreement to join the Partnership for Peace. 
  And finally they discussed Bosnia and the work of the 
contact 
group, which resumes on Thursday [16 June], the spokesman said.

<F P=106> ["Evening Talk" by Yang Chu (5017 2612): "Is a World War To </F>
Break Out?" -- On Korean Peninsula Situation] 
  [Text] A tense situation has arisen in the East, and 
another in the West. The former is on the Korean Peninsula, and 
a war seems to be erupting. The latter is in Bosnia, in 
southern Europe, and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that 
if the situation were not handled well, it would result in a 
world war! 
  As a matter of fact, whether the situation is more tense in 
the East or in the West, it will only lead to an outcome, that 
is, the situation will relax after a moment of tension, and no 
war will erupt. Neither the situation on the Korean Peninsula 
nor that in Bosnia will trigger a world war. 
  The situation on the Korean Peninsula is tense. After 
seceding from the IAEA, the DPRK now is saying that it may 
withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United 
States said that it would impose severe sanctions on the DPRK 
and that if the motion is not adopted by the UN Security 
Council, it -- together with its several allies -- would impose 
sanctions on the DPRK. The DPRK's reaction, however, was that: 
If you impose sanctions on us, it will mean a war. 
  It seems there is no leeway left. 
  Is this the case? The answer is no. Former U.S. President 
Carter is now maneuvering in the DPRK. China too is persuading 
various parties and hopes that the talks can be resumed to bring 
about peace. Russia also took the stand of discussing and 
settling the dispute through talks when it proposed the idea of 
calling an international conference. 
  The most fundamental question is: Who wants to go to war? 
Is it the DPRK? No, it cannot afford a war. In modernized 
warfare, a small country with few soldiers will use up all its 
strength very quickly, which is not worthwhile. What about the 
United States? Clinton is full of worries and dares not make any 
decision, even when thinking for a long time about dispatching 
troops to Haiti to deal with the 7,500-strong Haitian armed 
forces, who are equipped only with obsolete firearms dating back 
to World War II, so he certainly will not provoke the DPRK 
troops, who are more ferocious. If half of the more than 30,000 
U.S. soldiers stationed in the ROK are killed, would he still be 
President? 
  As said before, the DPRK really wants to open a dialogue 
with 
the United States, to win U.S. diplomatic recognition, and to 
receive U.S. economic aid. In any case, no war will erupt as 
long as no party really wants it. As the saying goes, one hand 
alone cannot clap; now that neither hand wants to clap, how can 
a sound be made?! 
  On the other hand, the U.S. Senate and House of 
Representatives have adopted a resolution to lift the arms 
embargo on Bosnia, but Clinton can use his presidential power to 
veto it. The Congress needs a two-thirds absolute majority vote 
to overrule Clinton's veto. 
  Now Russia is not the only country against lifting the arms 
embargo on the Bosnian Muslims; Britain and Canada also object 
to it. Clinton must seriously consider this. 
  Even if the arms embargo is lifted, it will not necessarily 
lead to a world war. Who is going to fight the so-called world 
war? Russia and the United States? A nuclear war? Their 
strategic nuclear missiles are no longer trained on each other. 
The United States is using its money and technology to help the 
Russians dismantle their nuclear weapons, and U.S. experts and 
journalists have visited Russian nuclear missile bases, which in 
the past were kept absolutely secret. Moscow is placing its 
hopes for economic restructuring on the West; how can it be in 
the mood to fight a war! Kozyrev's bluff only lays him open to 
ridicule!

  [Text] Vienna, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Delegates from 75 
countries, including China, met here on Tuesday [14 June] to 
discuss a draft nuclear safety convention on new safety 
standards for nuclear power plants. 
  The three-day international conference, organized by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will vote on the 
draft convention which will require its signatories to close 
down unsafe nuclear power plants. 
  The agreement will be formally signed at an IAEA conference 
scheduled for this September if it is approved at the meeting. 
  According to the convention, signatories will be responsible 
for choice of location, planning, building, operation, 
distribution of personnel and capital, and safety assessments of 
their nuclear power stations. 
  Under the convention, signatories are also obliged to report 
on the implementation of the agreement at regular iaea meetings. 
  More than 420 nuclear power plants are now operating in some 
30 countries worldwide.

  [Text] China will consult major Asia-Pacific countries 
this week on rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), a senior official said yesterday. 
  The consultation will take place at the two-day Awashima 
Forum, which starts in Japan on Friday. 
  The forum, organized by the Japan Institute of International 
Affairs, will shed light on Asia-Pacific cooperation after the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round in April. 
  Almost all the countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific Rim 
are expected to participate in the conference. 
  "We attach great importance to integration with the 
Asia-Pacific economies, with which most of our trade is 
involved," said Long Yongtu, assistant minister at the Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). 
  He leaves today for Japan together with a senior Chinese 
research fellow in the automobile industry. 
  He said that the advice of Asia Pacific nations would be 
beneficial to China. 
  Most countries in the region support China's re-entry into 
the global free trade body because they know that today's 
multilateral trade system would be incomplete without Chinese 
participation.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Will WTO Reduce or Enhance </F>
U.S. Sovereignty?"] 
  [Text] Washington, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Washington never 
lost a war or won a treaty. To some lawmakers on capitol hill, 
this is still true. 
  The treaty is the final pact of the Uruguay Round talks of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Signed on 
April 15, it will create the World Trade Organization (WTO), a 
global trading system supposedly based on sound principles. 
  Within the WTO, Washington will not enjoy veto power. With 
only one of 117 votes, some lawmakers are worried that the 
country will be out-voted by third world countries, its 
sovereignty reduced, and its laws undermined. 
  This is the key argument of wto opponents in congress, who 
have stepped up their opposition, saying that the Uruguay Round 
agreement should not be allowed to sail through congress like a 
ship passing in the night. 
  "I'm not worried about sovereignty. I'm worried about losing 
it," said Jesse Helms (D-NC), member of the senate foreign 
relations committee. "The United States gets one vote, but it 
will pay 20 percent of the budget for it." 
  The Clinton administration, which stresses that Washington 
will be the prime beneficiary of a better world trade system 
under WTO, says people like helms should listen carefully to 
thoughtful trade experts. 
  "Our sovereignty is enhanced because a substantially 
improved 
dispute-settlement system will permit us to enforce rights more 
effectively while at the same time preserving our own trade 
laws," Rufus Yerxa, deputy U.S. trade representative, told a 
senate hearing today. 
  Lawmakers who oppose the WTO often compares it with the 
United Nations, where Washington enjoys the right of veto. They 
are worried that if the U.S. loses a case in the WTO, it will 
either change its laws to pay compensation or face trade 
retaliation from abroad. 
  "We are transferring substantial power to an international 
body that can coerce the United States to change our behavior," 
argued House Representative Newt Gingrich (R-GA). 
  The U.S. has won many GATT cases on important issues such as 
Japan's barriers to imports of agricultural goods, South Korea's 
beef quotas, the European Community's oil fee subsidies and 
Norway's procurement practices. 
  According to officials here, a WTO dispute-settlement panel 
recommendation does not automatically change U.S. law. If the 
U.S. loses a case, it is the sovereign right of the U.S. 
Congress to decide what to do with the prevailing decision. 
  Some congressmen don't believe this. "This is a plethora of 
red tape that means nothing," Senator Helms said. "It's not 
going to happen." 
  "We are still going to have problems with countries under 
this agreement; I don't think there should be any illusions 
about that," Rufus Yerxa admitted at today's hearing. "This is 
the best we can do."

  [Text] Haikou, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's top judge, Ren 
Jianxin, today called for the country's courts to learn from how 
other countries' courts function. 
  The president of the Supreme People's Court, in a written 
text conveyed to a national judicial conference on foreign 
affairs now being held here, suggested that from other 
countries' experiences, courts could learn how better to fulfil 
the tasks laid on them by China's Constitution. 
  China has established ties with courts from nearly 100 
countries and regions, and international organizations such as 
the International Court, according to the conference. 
  In the past ten years, the supreme court sent 125 
delegations 
of 429 people abroad for visits, and received 113 delegations of 
554 members, the sources said. 
  Ren Jianxin said such foreign affairs work has helped to 
promote China's judicial exchanges with other countries, and win 
understanding and support from the international community.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 14 (XINHUA) -- U.N. Envoy to Yemen 
Lakhdar Ibrahimi said here today that there has been "positive 
and encouraging progress" on the Yemen issue. 
  Before leaving the UAE capital for Doha, Qatar, Ibrahimi 
said 
there are some progress since both Sanaa and Aden have agreed to 
resume the former joint military committee and add new members 
to it. 
  The U.N. envoy was on a visit to Yemen and other Gulf and 
Arab countries for implementing the U.N. Security Council 
Resolution 924 for ending the five-week long Yemeni fighting. 
  The U.N. envoy said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
has 
accepted Aden's suggestion of keeping foreign members and 
increasing new members in the committee. 
  Ibrahimi said U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
today reappealed to the rival forces in Yemen to abide by the 
Security [Council] resolution of truce. 
  Commenting on his meeting with leaders of the southern part 
of Yemen in Mukalla on Monday, Ibrahimi said both Sanaa and Aden 
had accepted the cease fire suggestion, but it was regrettable 
that there was no truce, though the intensity of fighting has 
decreased. 
  Both Sanaa and Aden accepted the idea of dialogue, but both 
of them had their conditions, he added. 
  Ibrahimi denied the information reported by some news 
agencies that he planted in Mukalla a suggestion of settling up 
a Yemen federation or confederation, saying that to discuss the 
matter is too early. 
  Today, Ibrahimi also met with UAE President Zayed Bin-Sultan 
Al Nahayyan. 
  The envoy arrived here Monday night and left here today for 
Qatar. 
  Latest reports reaching here from Doha said Qatari Amir 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani received this evening the 
U.N. envoy in Doha.

<F P=106> [By Wang Wong: "More U.S. Imports Due"] </F>
  [Text] Sino-U.S. trade will exceed $30 billion this year 
and the Chinese surplus will decline, a government official has 
predicted. 
  "Imports from the U.S. are set to expand as China's economic 
growth remains in the fast lane," said Ou Huarong of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC). 
  In the first four months of this year, China's exports to 
the 
U.S. totalled $4.9 billion and its imports $3.5 billion. 
  Ou does not expect the U.S. deficit with China to run as 
high 
as last year's $6 billion. 
  He urges the U.S. to relax its controls over high-technology 
exports to China to help balance trade. 
  The U.S. has not formally revoked the economic sanctions it 
imposed against China in 1989. In fact, certain new 
restrictions have been added. 
  "The export controls are a Cold War product, yet the U.S. is 
far from reaching any breakthrough in this regard," Ou pointed 
out. 
  In Beijing late this month the two countries are scheduled 
to 
discuss the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) and 
trade in services. 
  Ou says the two governments should maintain the momentum in 
bilateral trade that picked up when U.S. President Bill Clinton 
decided on May 26 to renew China's most-favoured-nation status 
and delink it with human rights. 
  He urges the U.S. not to put China on the Priority Country 
List for alleged "severe" violation of intellectual property 
rights. The U.S. has until the end of June to make the decision. 
  "We don't want to see a setback in bilateral trade with 
China 
being placed on the list," Ou said. 
  "The Chinese Government has fully implemented the Memorandum 
of Understanding on IPR between the two countries and has 
established an IPR protection legal system that represents the 
highest level of protection on IPR. 
  "The government has taken notice of infringements of IPR, 
particularly in audio and video products, and has taken positive 
and effective measures to curb the violation," he said. He 
added that the U.S. should recognize the effort. 
  According to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, once a country is 
put on the Prority Country List, it will have to be engaged in a 
half-year period of negotiation with the U.S.. If the 
negotiations are unsuccessful, the U.S. will announce 
retaliatory measures against products of the country in question. 
  As for access to Chinese markets for American products, Ou 
said China has also fulfilled the terms set forth in another 
bilateral agreement. 
  For example, China has on it own slashed the number of 
import 
quotas and licenses, plus tariffs on a wide range of products, 
in addition to what is done according to Sino-U.S. bilateral 
market access memorandum of understanding. 
  MOFTEC has further enhanced transparency by regularly 
publishing all effective trade policies in its Statement, a 
public record similar to the U.S. Federal Register. 
  Ou said the first China Foreign Trade Law, which was 
announced on May 12, has settled the problem by stipulating a 
uniform trade policy across the nation. 
  On agricultural issues, Ou said the two countries have 
already made progress in that China has lifted the ban on 
importation of wheat from California and apples from Washington 
State. And several protocols on animal products have also been 
signed. 
  As for trade in services, Ou said China and the U.S. should 
discuss matters within the framework of the General Agreement on 
Trade in Services (GATS), which was signed in Morocco in April 
by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The two-way trade seems to be headed in the right direction. 
  For instance, MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi and U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ron Brown have decided that the two countries should 
set up joint workshops covering a wide spectrum of industries, 
such as telecommunications, aerospace, chemicals, energy, 
transportation, environmental protection and trade in services. 
  The two sides have also organized a workshop to address the 
differences in how they compile trade statistics which have led 
to American claims of an exaggerated deficit with China. 
  At the same time, Ou expressed concern over trade 
protectionism in the U.S..

  [Text] Washington, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to news 
from Houston, the Chinese Ministry of Coal Industry and the U.S. 
Anran [name as transliterated] Petroleum and Natural Gas Company 
signed at the company's headquarters in Houston on 10 June two 
agreements and one letter of intent on cooperation between the 
two sides in prospecting for natural gas deposits in China's 
Sanjiao coal mine in Shanxi Province and the Huainan coal mine 
in Anhui Province. 
  Wang Senhao, Chinese minister of coal industry; Anran 
Chairman Kenneth Lay [name as transliterated], and Qiu Shengyun, 
Chinese consul general in Houston, attended the signing ceremony. 
  Anran, the largest natural gas company in the United States, 
initiated discussions with the Chinese Ministry of Coal Industry 
and relevant companies two years ago concerning possibilities 
for cooperation in exploiting natural gas deposits, and it on 
many occasions sent personnel to China to carry out on-the-spot 
observations. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Anran's 
chairman said that he was very delighted by and satisfied with 
the cooperation with China, which is the most important project 
for the company. He added that China is rich in coal gas 
reserves and that cooperation in their exploitation will be 
beneficial to both sides. He disclosed that his company has 
decided to establish long-term friendly and mutually beneficial 
cooperation with China. 
  The Chinese minister expressed his appreciation for Anran's 
efforts to promote the development of trade and economic 
relations between China and the United States. He expressed his 
hope that Anran and other U.S. petroleum and natural gas 
companies will try to expand cooperation with China. 
  Prior to his arrival in Houston, the Chinese minister 
visited 
New York and Washington, where he held talks with U.S. Energy 
Secretary O'Leary and other officials. Both sides expressed 
interest in expanding cooperation between the two countries in 
exploiting energy and coal gas deposits.

<F P=106> [Article by Lu Zhengrong: "Progress in Sino-U.S. Relations"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent decision to 
renew China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status and to 
de-link the future MFN renewal from human rights issues has 
cleared away a major obstacle in bilateral trade relations, and 
created a good turning point for normal development of Sino-US 
relations. 
  As Chinese officials have pointed out, Clinton's decision 
would create favorable conditions for further expanding trade 
and economic cooperation between the two countries, helping 
improve and develop bilateral relations in the fundamental 
interest of the two nations. 
  Over the past several years, decision making concerning the 
US policy toward China has been filled with a series of 
complicated contradictions. On the one hand, the idealist trend 
calls for the US government to put more stress on ideological 
goals and on human rights issues. On the other hand, realistic 
or practical demands require a kind of pragmatical, sustainable 
long-term approach towards China, with more consideration for 
America's economic and strategic interests. The United States 
wishes to see a unified and stable China, because a weak or 
troubled China may bring about regional instability in the 
Asian-Pacific Region. The United States also sees an 
increasingly strong China as a potential opponent. 
  Under these circumstances, the issue of MFN status, 
originally a subject of foreign relations, had evolved into one 
of the focuses of America's domestic political struggle. The 
annual review of China's MFN status became not only an annoyance 
to China, but a wrench American politicians used to throw in 
each others' works, which caused considerable bother in both 
countries business communities. 
  There are several factors contributing to the US 
government's 
change on its China policy. First, the US government realized 
that it is dealing with an accelerated economy in the world. 
The United States has growing economic interests in China, 
where the economic trend is providing enormous opportunities for 
trade and investment. Economic consideration has always been a 
top priority for the pragmatic US government decision-makers. 
  Second, the past decade has seen much progress China has 
made 
[sentence as published]. Its foreign and reform policies have 
steadily improved, and this progress is not seen to be slowing 
down in the near future. 
  Moreover, it is widely recognized that China's strategic 
role 
in the post-Cold War world didn't decrease but increased, which 
is supported by its progressively stronger economy. 
  The two countries also have many common interests in a 
number 
of global issues such as nonproliferation of high arms 
technologies and environmental protection. 
  Pressure on the US government for separating trade from 
nontrade related issues was mounted not only from the economic 
circle, but from numerous politicians and diplomats. It was 
widely recognized that the annual review of China's MFN status 
was a double-edged sword which could have cut into both parties' 
economic interests. 
  However, since Americans have a long standing tradition of 
idealism, and proselityzing their own morals throughout the 
world, it is not easy for them to give up the attempt to 
influence China, probably through means other than trade under 
the pretext of human rights. However, things changed hands, and 
a bright cooperative future is seen to be rising from the dust 
of long-time foot stomping. 
  The issue of human rights in essence reflects some people's 
dissatisfaction with China's political system to a large degree. 
However, China's system, which has survived nearly 45 years of 
various trials and hardships, will certainly not be changed by 
any other than China's own. 
  Due to different levels of social development, the United 
Statics and China have many differences in human rights views. 
As a developing country, what concerns China most is how to 
provide adequate food and clothing to its 1.2 billion people. 
In fact, it has to put more stress on the rights of survival 
and development, because China still has about 80 million people 
living at substandard levels, mainly concentrated in remote and 
poor areas. But the problem of poverty in the United States is 
not of the magnitude as China. 
  So if not viewed with an understanding attitude, the United 
States will have difficulty understanding China's viewpoints in 
regards to human rights. Of course, China is willing to discuss 
relevant issues with the United States and other Western 
countries, but is not receptive to foreign pressure. 
  To sum it up, consideration of economic and strategic 
interests have surmounted the political quarrels in the US 
decision making. We are looking forward to future Sino-US 
relations, after the positive step taken by President Bill 
Clinton, a practical, productive, fore-sightfull stand in the 
interests of Sino-American relations, that will be essential to 
the stable and growing maturity of Sino-US relations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- State President Jiang 
Zemin held talks with Estonian President Lennart Meri at the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this afternoon. 
  Jiang pointed out that relations between the two countries 
have developed smoothly. Meri said there is a good basis for 
the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the 
two countries. 
  The talks proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. 
Jiang warmly welcomed President Meri on his visit, saying that 
he was very glad to make the latter's acquaintance. He said: 
The maintenance of exchanges between state leaders can help 
enhance mutual understanding between leaders, and plays a 
particularly important role in promoting the development of 
state-to-state relations. 
  Jiang told Meri: "Your Excellency's visit is an important 
event in the history of relations between the two countries, and 
will surely breathe new life into cooperation between the two 
countries." Jiang expressed his appreciation for the positive 
attitude adopted by the Estonian Government and President Meri 
on developing Sino- Estonian relations. He said: Thanks to 
joint efforts by the two sides, relations between China and 
Estonia have developed smoothly since the two countries 
established diplomatic relations three years ago. China is 
satisfied with this development, and is full of confidence in 
future development prospects. 
  Meri expressed his thanks for China's recognition of Estonia 
soon after it regained independence. He said: "My current 
visit to China is very important and historically significant. 
Estonia and China have differences as well as lots of common 
points. There is a good basis for the development of mutually 
beneficial cooperation between the two countries." 
  Meri said: Although Estonia is a small country, it is in a 
favorable geopolitical and geoeconomic position, and can play an 
important role in China's entry into the West European market. 
He said: "Estonia and China have signed agreements on economic 
cooperation, trade, and investment. A number of Estonian 
entrepreneurs are accompanying me on my current visit to China. 
I hope Estonian and Chinese entrepreneurs will increase 
contacts in order to expand economic cooperation between the two 
countries. There is vast potential for economic cooperation 
between Estonia and China." 
  Jiang said: China is pleased with Estonia's achievements in 
consolidating its state sovereignty and national independence, 
in invigorating its economy, in maintaining social stability, 
and in protecting its people's lives. He said: Estonia is a 
country which has regained its independence. China respects and 
understands the way Estonia determines its social and economic 
development paths, as well as its foreign policy, according to 
its specific circumstances. He said: "Countries differ from 
each other in terms of population and size. However, we have 
always held that all countries -- whether they are big or small, 
rich or poor, strong or weak -- are all equal members in the 
international community. In international affairs, we are 
against the pursuit of hegemony and power politics, as well as 
interference in other countries' internal affairs. We advocate 
a new international political and economic order whose core is 
noninterference in other countries' internal affairs." He said 
emphatically: China adheres to its independent foreign policy. 
Its principal task is to handle its own affairs well and 
develop its economy. By handling its own affairs well, China 
can make major contributions to the world. He expressed his 
belief that China and Estonia share common ground in this 
respect. 
  On economic relations and trade between the countries, 
Jiang said: Economic relations and trade are an important part 
of relations between the two countries; we can say that they are 
the material basis for political relations between the two 
countries. Although China and Estonia have conducted direct 
trade for only a short time, they have made a good start. He 
said: "Your Excellency has brought along a delegation of 
entrepreneurs during your current visit, thus creating a good 
opportunity for people in the industrial circles of the two 
countries to establish contacts with each other. We are ready to 
work with Estonia to tap potential; open up new fields of 
economic cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, 
and common prosperity; introduce diverse forms of cooperation; 
and improve the quality of cooperation, in order to raise 
economic cooperation and trade between the two countries to a 
new level." 
  The two leaders also briefed each other on the situation in 
their own countries. Meri expressed his agreement with Jiang's 
view that stability is the prerequisite for development, 
maintaining that every country should have a "brake" to act on 
its economic development. He said: China has achieved positive 
results in its economic reform. 
  Jiang and Meri also exchanged views on regional and 
international issues of common concern. 
  After the talks, President Jiang and President Meri signed 
the "Joint Declaration of the People's Republic of China and the 
Republic of Estonia." Afterward, Jiang hosted a reception to 
welcome President and Mrs. Meri, as well as their delegation. 
  Before the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony in the 
square outside the eastern gate of the Great Hall of the People 
to warmly welcome President Meri. Present at the welcoming 
ceremony were Qian Qichen, State Council vice premier and 
foreign minister; Wang Bingqian, National People's Congress 
Standing Committee vice chairman; Wang Songda, China Zhi Gong 
Dang Central Committee vice chairman; Liu Songjin, Chinese 
Government Reception Committee chairman and vice communications 
minister; Helle Meri, wife of President Meri; and Estonian 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and visiting Estonian President Lennart Meri, during a meeting 
here this afternoon, expressed the conviction that there is 
great potential for the two countries' trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  Extending a warm welcome to Meri, Li Peng said that China 
recognized Estonia's re-independence and established diplomatic 
relations with it quickly, and bilateral relations have 
developed smoothly with frequent exchanges at all levels since 
diplomatic ties were formed three years ago. 
  "In the current visit, President Meri has conducted the 
first 
summit meeting between China and Estonia since Estonia regained 
its independence, and the visit is of great significance in 
promoting bilateral friendly cooperation in each field," Li told 
Meri. 
  China respects the Estonian people's chosen path of 
development, Li said. Sticking to its foreign policy of peace 
and independence, he added, China is willing to make friends 
with all countries around the world. 
  China, holding that all countries, small or big, are all 
equal, attaches importance to developing relations with Estonia, 
and is willing to exert efforts with Estonia to help bilateral 
relations grow healthily and stably over the long term, Li said. 
  Meri told Li: "I had fruitful talks with President Jiang 
Zemin yesterday. My visit here is very successful. We are 
looking forward to vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen's future tour to Estonia. 
  "Exchanging visits of the leaders of two countries will give 
more concrete political and economic essence to bilateral 
relations." 
  He said that the agreement on economic and trade cooperation 
signed by China and Estonia has set a sound foundation for 
strengthening bilateral cooperation. 
  "Now Estonia is stable politically and economically. We 
welcome Chinese enterprises to make investments in our country," 
Meri said. 
  Li Peng said that China and Estonia have made a good start 
in 
trade and economic cooperation, toward which the Chinese 
Government holds a positive attitude. 
  The two countries should adhere to the principles of 
equality, mutual benefit and complementarity in developing trade 
and economic cooperation, and widen the base for cooperation 
gradually while bearing realities in mind, Li Peng said. 
  The Chinese Government encourages Chinese enterprises to 
conduct trade and economic exchanges with Estonia, including 
setting up joint-ventures or factories financed solely by China, 
Li Peng said. However, internationally-accepted practices should 
be taken into consideration and practical efficiency be 
respected. 
  Showing an interest in paper-making cooperation, Meri said 
that Estonia, with abundant forest resources, is to export 
paper-making technologies, paper pulp and other materials to 
China. 
  He said that any kind of investment by Chinese enterprises 
in 
any field in Estonia will be welcome. 
  Li Peng said the departments concerned in both governments 
could investigate the feasibility of the cooperation, and if 
possible, both governments should give impetus to the initiative. 
  Li and Meri exchanged views on cooperation in other fields 
in 
the firm belief that there is great potential for trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  Meri and his party visited the Great Wall this morning. They 
are to leave for Shanghai tomorrow.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 13 (XINHUA) -- The governments and 
peoples of Asia-Pacific countries and areas will surely play an 
influential role in the global course of women's progress and 
development. 
  Chen Muhua, vice chairman of the National People's Congress 
of China and chairman of the All-China Women Federation, who is 
also the head of the Chinese delegation at the second Asian and 
Pacific ministerial conference on women in development, made the 
remarks at the ministerial meeting here today. 
  She said that the governments and peoples in Asia and 
Pacific, an economically most dynamic region in today's 
turbulent and volatile world, have made their own efforts in 
implementing the Nairobi forward-looking strategies adopted at 
the 3rd World Women Conference in 1985 and achieved positive 
fruits since then. 
  She mentioned the fact that in this region we have the 
largest number of poverty-stricken women, which account for 
about 60 percent of the world total. 
  Therefore, she noted, solving the problem of women's poverty 
in this region will be a great contribution to the advancement 
of women in the world at large. 
  She is confident that the government and peoples of this 
region will surely play an influential role in the global course 
of women's progress and development. 
  Chen Muhua appreciated the Jakarta declaration and plan for 
action submitted by the earlier senior officials meeting held 
here from June 7 to 11. 
  She noted that the Jakarta declaration has pooled the wisdom 
and experience of all the participants, demonstrates the 
determination and will of the governments in this region to 
accelerate the realization of the goals of the strategies, and 
reflects the aspirations and voices of the women in this region. 
  She said the experiences of the Chinese women also show that 
women's progress and development can be pursued only in the 
favorable environment of national economic growth and social 
development. 
  The Chinese Government has all along attached great 
importance to women's progress and development and been 
committed to the advancement of women. 
  However, she pointed out that in China today, there is still 
inequality between men and women in the sharing of power and 
decision-making, women have less employment opportunities than 
men, violations of women's rights in marriage and family and 
their rights and interests of the person take place from time to 
time in some areas. 
  In view of this, the Chinese Government has taken measures 
to 
address these problems. 
  Chen Muhua said that the Chinese Government and people will 
go all out to prepare for the Fourth World Conference on Women 
to be convened in 1995 in Beijing. 
  The Chinese Government and people will conscientiously 
fulfill the obligations and duties as the host country so as to 
make due contribution to the success of the grand global 
gathering.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 14 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese road

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
expressed the hope here today that China and Italy can seize the 
present opportune moment and propel their economic and trade 
links to a new high. 
  Several years ago, the premier noted, the Italian Government 
took the lead among Western countries in readjusting its 
policies toward China and has taken positive steps toward 
developing Sino-Italian ties. 
  This, he added, has resulted in the relatively fast growth 
of 
economic and trade ties between the two countries. 
  "We hope this momentum of development will be sustained," he 
told a group of visiting Italian entrepreneurs from the General 
Confederation of Italian Industry (GCII). 
  Li voiced the conviction that Italian entrepreneurs will 
exert themselves toward this end. 
  China and Italy can cooperate not only in heavy industry, 
but 
also in the light and textile industries, and leather and food 
processing industries, where Italy has its unique technical 
advantages, Li said. 
  Referring to it as a major influence in Italian economic 
circles, Li said the confederation has contributed to bilateral 
economic and trade ties. He also expressed the hope that the 
visit will yield fruit. 
  GCII Chairman Luigi Abete told Li that Italy's economic 
cycle 
has entered recovery, which will surely provide better 
conditions for Italy-China economic and trade cooperation. 
  The GCII consists of numerous medium and small-sized 
businesses, all keen on developing cooperation with China, Luigi 
said. 
  The visit is designed to inform them more about China's 
development strategy as they determine key sectors in which to 
invest in China, he said. 
  The Italian visitors are here as guests of the China Council 
for the Promotion of International Trade.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China was 
concerned with the situation in the Balkan region, and held that 
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Balkan states 
should be respected. 
  The interests of the minorities in every country of the

adding that China would like to further the bilateral links in 
various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence. 
  Starova arrived here on June 4. During his stay, Chinese

Chinese ships pass through the Panama Canal each year, with 130 
of them flying the national flag of China, according to Cheng 
Zhongbiao, president of the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO).

three regular shipping lines to the region, two for 
containerized cargo and one for general cargo, visiting several 
ports in the area. 
  China is continuing its policy of opening to the outside 
world and is increasing its commercial exchange with Latin 
America, Cheng said. 
  COSCO is cooperating with its Latin American counterparts 
and 
is doing its share to promote economic development in the world, 
he added. 
  The Chinese maritime transport official is touring Latin 
America and North America. He arrived in Panama City last night

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Foreign Hi-Tech to Break Railway </F>
Bottle-neck"] 
  [Text] China hopes to use foreign technology to double the 
speed of passenger trains and boost the loading capacity of 
freight trains. 
  Officials believe this would free up the bottle-necked 
Chinese rail lines, particularly in the east. 
  Meanwhile, companies from Japan, Germany and France are 
competing fiercely to take part in the 70 billion yuan ($8 
billion) construction of the huge Beijing-Shanghai high-speed 
railway. 
  In the coastal areas, China will build high-speed passenger 
railways with speeds reaching 250 kilometres per hour, said Shen 
Zhijie, chief engineer for the Ministry of Railways, yesterday. 
  On existing jammed rail lines, speeds will be raised to 140 
kilometres per hour by introducing new rolling stock technology, 
Shen said at a Sino-Japan seminar on high-speed railways. 
  Passenger train speed on other lines will be pushed near 100 
kilometres per hour by improving the arrangement of operation. 
  Currently, the fastest speed of passenger trains is about 
110 
kilometres per hour. 
  The Guangzhou-Shenzhen railway, with designed speed of 160 
kilometres per hour, is expected to open for traffic before the 
end of the year. 
  By the end of the century the average load of a freight 
train 
will be raised from 2,519 tons in 1992 to 2,900 tons, Shen said. 
  China is also plotting the high-speed railway linking 
Beijing 
and Shanghai. The 1,300-kilometre line will connect five cities 
each with a population of more than 2 million. 
  If completed before 2000, it will handle 120 million 
passengers each year, three times more than the existing line, 
  Travel time from Beijing to Shanghai would be cut from 17 
hours to 7 hours, experts said. 
  The three-day Sino-Japan seminar on high-speed railways, 
which opened yesterday in Beijing, aims to introduce Japan's 
technology and experience on its trains, said Hiroshi Okada, 
president of the Japan Railway Technical Service, which 
sponsored the seminar. 
  Japan's bullet train, running since 1964, was the first 
high-speed train in the world. 
  Japan hopes its technology will be used in China's 
high-speed 
railway projects, Okada said. 
  The Chinese Government is trying to borrow money from Japan 
to complete the Beijing-Shanghai line, in the fourth batch of 
loans from Tokyo. 
  Japan is still undecided on the loans, but is showing a 
positive attitude to the project, Okada said. 
  In the past 14 years, China used $2.1 billion in Japanese 
loans for its railway construction. 
  Japanese banks also showed strong interest in this project, 
he added. 
  Matsuo Michihiko, Japan's Vice Minister for Transport, said 
Japan is willing to transfer its technology to China. 
  The seminar is Japan's latest effort to boost its ties to 
China's high-speed railway project. Last November, German 
companies held a similar seminar to introduce its ICE train to 
China.

  [Text] Pyongyang, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The China Mining 
Group's Pyongyang office -- the first trading firm China has set 
up in Korea -- started operations today. 
  Choe Pong-su, vice chairman of the Korean External Economic 
Committee; Yi Sun-myon, Korean vice minister of mining industry; 
Qiao Zonghuai, Chinese ambassador to Korea; and commercial 
attaches of foreign embassies in Pyongyang attended the 
inaugural reception today. 
  In his speech, Chang Gaiming, vice president of the China 
Mining Group, said: In recent years, along with the development 
and changes in the international trade situation, the China 
Mining Group has forged closer economic and trade ties with 
Korea. As a result, the previous unitary transaction for 
accounts has been gradually replaced by more flexible and 
diversified trade forms such as spot exchange trade, counter 
trade, entrepot trade, and barter trade between the two sides. 
He expressed the belief that there are bright prospects for 
cooperation in trade between the Mining Group and Korea. 
  Speaking at the reception, Kong Kang-su, vice president of 
Korea's Nonferrous Metal Export and Import Corporation, said: 
The inauguration of the China Mining Group's Pyongyang office 
symbolizes a crystallization of the blood-sealed friendship and 
trust, as well as the inalienable friendship between the Korean 
and Chinese peoples. He pledged to broaden and develop trade 
relations between the two firms.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (XINHUA) -- South Korea staged a 
civil defense exercise, including an air-raid drill, for 20 
minutes across the country this afternoon. 
  The drill involved all civil defense corps members, whose 
job 
is to organize evacuations and provide first aid for air-raid 
victims. 
  South Korea has conducted monthly civil-defense drills in 
the 
past. But in view of "the tensions" over the nuclear issue of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), this month's 
training was expanded nationwide and included more personnel and 
equipment. 
  Today's exercise took place at a time when South Korea, the 
United States and Japan are stepping up their effort to seek 
U.N. sanctions against the DPRK since Pyongyang reportedly 
banned inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel in its reactors to 
determine whether the fuel has been diverted to making atomic 
weapons. 
  Pyongyang insisted that its nuclear program is strictly 
peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to 
accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng has 
shown deep concern for the masses affected by floods in 
Guangdong Province recently. On 12 June he extended through the 
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters sympathy and 
solicitude to the people in the flood-stricken areas and paid 
high tribute to cadres, masses, officers and men of the People's 
Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force participating in the 
flood fighting and relief operations. Premier Li Peng also gave 
instructions on flood-related work, urging the affected people 
to fight the floods in unity, help themselves by stepping up 
production, and overcome difficulties to ensure an all-round 
victory in the struggle. 
  Caused by this year's third typhoon, the heavy rainfall and, 
in some areas, powerful rainstorms widely hit Guangdong Province 
8-9 June, sending river water levels quickly up -- 0.27 meter 
above the highest water level for the Jiuzhou River near 
Lianjiang City and above their warning level for Beijiang, 
Jianjiang, and Luojiang Rivers. Floods have affected 23 
counties and districts in Zhanjiang, Maoming, Yangjiang, 
Zhaoqing, Foshan, and Guangzhou cities; 7.95 million mu of 
farmland; and 8.09 million people -- 440,000 of whom were once 
stranded -- causing 58 deaths; 684 injuries; damage to 
irrigation facilities worth 217 million yuan; and an estimated 
provincewide direct economic loss amounting to 5.8 billion yuan. 
  With the arrival of the floods, local governments and 
relevant departments were quick in organizing the masses for 
flood fighting and rescue operations, with more than 7,100 
officers and men from the army, navy, air force, and the armed 
police force stationed in Guangdong being rushed to the front 
line. All the 440,000 people stranded by floods earlier are now 
out of danger, with disaster relief operations going on in full 
swing. 
  Chen Junsheng, state councillor and head of the State Flood 
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, who was on an 
anti-flood inspection tour of the Taihu and Huaihe areas, also 
sent his regards to the flood victims in Guangdong, including 
Zhanjiang City. 
  Meanwhile, typhoon-related rainstorms in the past few days 
also sent water in Zhejiang Province's Qiantang and Puyang 
Rivers above their warning levels, affecting over 2 million 
people in more than 10 counties. Local cadres and masses have 
actively plunged themselves into flood relief operations.

  [Text] Fuzhou, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
inspection of Fujian Province, Tian Jiyun, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee, pointed out: It 
is necessary to stabilize and develop agriculture by every 
possible means, vigorously develop village and town enterprises, 
and make efforts to maintain the good momentum of the 
development of the three kinds of partially or wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises. 
  Tian Jiyun stressed: While making vigorous efforts to 
stabilize and expand grain production, we must actively engage 
ourselves in diverse economic undertakings, develop a type of 
farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum 
efficiency, and increase peasants' income. He said: Integrated 
management of trade, industry, and agriculture must not be 
merely an integration in form without an integration between the 
interests of the three sectors. When their interests are 
integrated, peasants would increase production as well as their 
income and, thus, we would be able to further arouse peasants' 
enthusiasm for production and to guide them to the market. We 
must pay attention to exploration in this respect when we deepen 
reform in rural areas in the future. 
  Tian Jiyun stressed: It is necessary to develop village and 
town enterprises by every possible means and vigorously 
encourage the development of enterprises run by individuals and 
privately run enterprises. We should look upon the development 
of the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises and village and town enterprises as a driving force 
for state enterprises. They rely on, supplement, and promote 
each other. Various economic sectors must coexist, and more 
than one wheel is needed to expedite the drive to establish a 
socialist market economy. 
  When Tian Jiyun heard that foreign businessmen are most 
worried about whether social stability can be maintained and 
whether policies can remain stable, he said: The overall 
situation of China's reform and opening up will remain 
unchanged. Reform and opening up accord with the trend of the 
times and the desire of the people. In more than 10 years, the 
state formulated a series of policies encouraging foreign 
businessmen to invest in China. These basic policies will 
remain unchanged. China enjoys social stability, adopts 
policies that give preferential treatment to foreign 
businessmen, and hopes they will commit investment without any 
worry and boldly go ahead with their investment projects, so as 
to maintain the good momentum of the development of the three 
kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. 
  Accompanied by Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian 
Provincial CPC Committee, and Yuan Qitong, vice chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial People's Congress, 
Tian Jiyun inspected Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou 
between 7-13 June. He held discussion meetings with foreign 
businessmen, peasant entrepreneurs, and cadres at the 
grass-roots level.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC), today called for priority to be given to the 
development of education in the process of realizing China's 
modernization. 
  Addressing a national education conference which opened in 
Beijing today, Jiang stressed the importance of shifting the 
focus of economic construction to relying on scientific and 
technological progress and improvement of the abilities of 
laborers. 
  Jiang spoke highly of Deng Xiaoping's theory on education 
and 
urged the party and leaders at various levels to attach 
importance to education and promote the development of 
educational reforms. 
  The conference is being sponsored by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council. 
  Premier Li Peng delivered a key-note report on behalf of the 
CPC Central Committee and State Council. 
  Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji and Hu Jintao, all members of the CPC 
politburo Standing Committee, were attending the conference. 
  Jiang said that accelerating the development of education 
will enhance China's national strength and help China to seize a 
favorable position in international competition. 
  He said that the development of education concerns the 
cultivation of a new generation for China's socialist 
modernization and its long stability and security. 
  He called on fully implementing "the outline of the reform 
and development for China's education" and "teachers' law". 
  On the question of respecting teachers and attaching 
importance to education, he stressed that teachers are the 
engineers of the soul of the man and he commanded the government 
at various levels to safeguard their legal rights and interests 
and to improve their working, studying and living conditions. 
  Jiang specially mentioned the question of joining education 
with labor and production, calling it one of China's important 
educational principles. 
  He said that the reform of education is aimed at turning 
China's educational structure and system toward serving the 
development of the socialist market economy and toward all-round 
social progress. 
  He called on the multitude of educators in educational 
administrations and schools to further emancipate minds, explore 
new ways to develop education and contribute to the formation of 
a socialist educational system with Chinese characteristics. 
  Premier Li Peng said that "the outline of the reform and 
development of China's education" issued by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council is a systematic document for the 
development of education in China. 
  He stressed popularization of nine-year compulsory education 
and elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged 
people; development of vocational and adult education; and 
reform of higher education. 
  He pointed out that compulsory education should be mainly 
undertaken by the government while adult and vocational 
education should be run by institutes and enterprises under the 
management of the government. 
  Li also talked about reform of the enrollment system in 
higher education, senior secondary schools and secondary 
professional schools, improvement of teachers' treatment, 
ethical education among students and increasing investment in 
education. 
  Vice-Premier Li Lanqing presided over the conference.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall and John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] One of China's best known dissidents, Wang Dan, has 
threatened to go on hunger strike tonight unless the security 
forces cease their surveillance and harassment. 
  Even though Mr Wang left Beijing for his hometown in 
Shandong 
prior to the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre in order 
to avoid police harassment, he was still followed everywhere he 
went. 
  The former student leader, who returned to Beijing on 
Sunday, 
said he was now "fed up" with constantly being followed and 
routinely being called in for questioning by the police. 
  "Unless I get some kind of guarantee of freedom of movement 
from the police, I will stage a hunger strike in protest," he 
said yesterday. 
  Mr Wang said his mother had visited the local police station 
yesterday to inform them of his intention but so far they had 
received no reply Mr Wang said he had not yet decided how long 
his threatened hunger strike would last, adding that its 
duration would largely depend on the response from the security 
forces. 
  Many observers predicted, however, that Mr Wang's hunger 
strike, if it occurred at all, would probably last no more than 
a few days. 
  "This sounds like just another publicity stunt," a Western 
diplomat said, "an attempt to keep human rights on the agenda" 
following U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on Most 
Favoured Nation [MFN] trading status. However, the threatened 
protest was a sign that while security in the capital had been 
generally more relaxed following the June 4 anniversary, 
surveillance of key dissidents remained as intense as ever and 
was unlikely to be curtailed. 
  Meanwhile a source close to the family said that dissident 
Chen Ziming's health had improved slightly since being released 
from prison, but he was still trying to find a doctor to give 
him a thorough examination and help him on the road to full 
recovery after having served nearly five years of a 13-year jail 
sentence. 
  A family source said the 42-year-old dissident, released 
from 
prison last month but not allowed to return to his home until 
last week, had been given medicine for his many ailments. 
  Of Mr Chen's troubles, his skin disorder was showing the 
biggest improvement though it was far from cured. He was taking 
medication for high blood pressure, and heart, stomach and 
kidney troubles contracted while in jail. 
  Mr Chen, convicted by a court of trying to subvert the 
Government during the 1989 pro-democracy rallies, was freed in 
May on medical parole as part of a Chinese effort to win MFN 
renewal. 
  However, Mr Chen is far from a free man. The source said he 
was under 24-hour police guard. Even his family members had to 
check through security to enter his apartment. He was not 
allowed to answer telephone calls. 
  "They would never let you in to his apartment," said the 
source. Asked about his spirits, the source said: "How can his 
mood be good when he can't speak freely?"

<F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Interim Provisions 
on the Employment of State Functionaries" were officially 
promulgated by the Ministry of Personnel today for 
implementation. They represented another important set of 
measures taken by China after the promulgation of the "Interim 
Regulations on State Functionaries" to establish and implement a 
public service system. 
  A person in charge of the Ministry of Personnel said: While 
carrying forward the fine tradition of China's system for the 
selection and employment of cadres, and while drawing on the 
useful experience of foreign countries in personnel appraisal, 
the "Provisions" conscientiously summed up the practice of 
employment through examination in the past six years or so and 
provided specific stipulations on every link for the employment 
of state functionaries. As such, they will play an active role 
in guarding the "entrance" to state administrative organs, in 
guaranteeing the basic quality of newly employed state 
functionaries, and in promoting honesty and industriousness of 
government organs in the performance of official duties. 
  The "Provisions" pointed out: The employment of state 
functionaries refers to the selection of state functionaries for 
nonleadership positions at and below the level of chief section 
member. As regards state functionaries selected from organs 
other than administrative organs to assume leadership positions 
and nonleadership positions at and above the deputy section 
level, they shall be transferred and do not fall under the 
category of employment. The criterion of hiring people with 
both political integrity and ability as well as the principle of 
openness, equality, competition, and selecting the best shall be 
upheld in the employment of state functionaries. Meanwhile, 
preferential treatment shall be given to applicants who are 
either of minority nationalities or ex-servicemen. 
  The Ministry of Personnel required that all units, whether 
they are carrying out organizational reform or not, must 
gradually establish a personnel mechanism that encourages 
openness, equality, and competition, beginning this year. 
Starting from the date the "Provisions" were promulgated, all 
areas and departments must handle jobs in strict accordance with 
the "Provisions." Whenever they employ personnel for leadership 
[as printed] positions at and below the level of chief section 
member, they must hold public examinations and select the best 
from among applicants. Beginning from the second half of this 
year, the Examinations and Employment Department of the Ministry 
of Personnel will formulate a series of detailed rules and 
regulations for implementation on the basis of the "Provisions," 
and will organize unified examinations for the employment of 
functionaries for the State Council's ministries, commissions, 
and organs. 
  According to his briefing, 29 provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions across the country and 63 departments of the 
State Council have adopted the method of holding examinations, 
to various extents, to employ over 71,000 people by selecting 
the excellent ones from among over 470,000 applicants for the 
supplement of their personnel since 1989. The practice of these 
examinations not only lays a foundation for the promulgation of 
laws and regulations on employment, but accumulates experience 
for the implementation of a public service system in an 
all-round way.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bi Quanzhong (3968 0356 1813) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- Reporters have learned 
from the State Education Commission that since last year's 
promulgation of the "Outline of the Reform and Development of 
China's Education" and the "Teachers' Law," party and government 
leaders in all localities have seized the opportune moment to 
implement them earnestly, and have taken effective measures to 
do practical turns for education, thereby effectively promoting 
the reform and development of educational services. 
  Data gathered in this respect shows that various localities 
have generally increased their input in education to solve the 
shortage of educational funds. In addition to ensuring that 
educational funds will increase along with economic growth and 
increases in financial revenue, Guangdong Province has, since 
last year, collected 1 percent of the annual income derived from 
secondary and tertiary industries as special funds for 
educational development, and raised funds in society through 
various channels to support education. Last year, the 
province's total input in education was 9.462 billion yuan, up 
61.8 percent from the previous year, while educational expenses 
rose by 38 percent from the year before. Input in education by 
Beijing Municipality hit an all-time high last year, with total 
input reaching 2.035 billion yuan. Input in education covered 
by the municipal budget accounted for more than 20 percent of 
the total budgetary expenditure for five consecutive years, 
while expenses for promoting universal education rose by an 
average annual rate of 14.9 percent for eight years in a row. 
Besides increasing its budgeted educational funds by 20.9 
percent, Jilin Province last year set up special funds for 
universalizing nine-year compulsory education, for establishing 
major colleges and universities, and for introducing major 
disciplines, and promulgated 10 policies on raising educational 
funds. Last year, Yunnan Province allocated 360 million yuan 
for education, an increase of more than 150 million yuan from 
1992. While ensuring increases in educational funds in two 
areas, Tianjin Municipality last year established an educational 
development fund and decided to set up a Tianjin University 
Scientific and Technological Industrial Zone and use the returns 
generated by it to supplement educational funds. Last year's 
input in education by Hainan Province was the highest since the 
island was designated a province, with educational expenses 
increasing by 26.8 percent from 466 million yuan in 1992 to 591 
million yuan. Last year, Qinghai Province also unveiled 13 
measures designed to ensure steady growth in education-related 
input. 
  Meanwhile, party and government leaders in all localities 
intensified their efforts to help teachers as they worked hard 
to increase teachers' pay and did practical turns for teachers. 
Last year, Jilin Province decided to pay special government 
allowances to 15 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
and one foreign academician who worked in the province, as well 
as 214 tutors for doctoral candidates. Liaoning's Dalian City 
invested more than 200 million yuan to build a "teachers' 
apartment building," thus enabling more than 1,300 teacher 
families to move into new houses. Liaoning's Xinmin City built a 
new village for teachers, thereby improving the housing 
conditions of 1,456 teacher families. In Zhejiang's Ningbo 
City, the recently promulgated policy on "double preferential 
treatment" aimed at doing practical turns for education was 
well-received by teachers. According to the policy, both single 
workers and working couples are entitled to 5- to 10-percent 
price discounts when they buy public housing. When teachers in 
rural areas build houses, the government will provide homesteads 
at government-set prices, and reduce certain taxes and charges 
or exempt the teachers from those taxes and charges. Over the 
past two years, the city has made arrangements to change the 
status of more than 2,000 private teachers to public-school 
teachers, fulfilling all relevant tasks ahead of schedule. 
Jiangsu Province decided that the provincial financial 
department would allocate 20 million yuan annually as subsidies 
for provincial colleges and universities to build houses for 
faculty members during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Last year, 
40,000 square meters [sq m] of houses were built, with another 
40,000 sq m to be built this year. The province also decided to 
concentrate apartment houses for college and university faculty 
members in Nanjing and other areas. 
  The Sichuan Provincial Government also proposed that the 
hospital affiliated with the Chengdu Traditional Chinese 
Medicine College be renamed the Sichuan Provincial Hospital for 
the Prevention and Control of Teachers' Occupational Diseases, 
where teachers can receive medical treatment and be hospitalized 
on a priority basis and on preferential terms. Henan, Anhui, 
and Hubei Provinces have all drawn up measures to ensure that 
salaries will be paid in full to primary and middle-school 
teachers every month. The measures specify that beginning this 
year, educational funds covered by local budgets will be placed 
under county management, and they will be listed separately and 
budgeted in full amounts.

  [Text] Xian, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The number of China's 
cities has almost doubled over the past decade, a momentum 
keeping pace with the country's rapid economic growth. 
  This was reported by the China City Development Society, 
which has just closed its third session in this capital of 
northwest China's Shaanxi Province. 
  By the end of 1993 China had 570 cities, a 97-percent 
increase from 1983. 
  In 1993 three out of ten Chinese lived in cities, while ten 
years ago less than two were urban residents. 
  Now 59 percent of the total national product and more than 
three-quarters of the state revenues come from cities. 
  The mix of big, medium and small cities has emerged as a 
more 
balanced combination assisting the social development. 
  Liu Guoguang, and director of the society, said that the 
process of urbanization is driven by China's reform and opening 
up. 
  When China's economy rocketed at a double-digit growth rate 
from 1992 to 1993, some 45 new cities sprang up a year. While 
for two decades before reform only one city emerged every year 
and a half. [sentence as received] 
  This phenomenon was also complicated by the regional 
discrepancy of economic development in China. 
  Rising in the fast-growing eastern and central areas, the 
tide of newly emerging cities slows as it reaches the relatively 
backward western parts of the country. 
  Between 1983 and 1993, the number of cities in the eastern 
areas increased from 103 to 247; in central China, from 122 to 
215; and in the western region, from 64 to 108. 
  Liu, also a leading economist, said that the development of 
cities will promote science and technology and improve 
efficiency, thereby quickening economic growth. 
  Experts present at the meeting said that a number of China's 
big cities will emerge early in the next century as 
international metropolises, including Beijing, Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xian, Wuhan and Dalian.

3189 3601): "Qian Qichen Says Returned Overseas Chinese, 
Relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese Are 
Important Forces for China's Modernization"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Vice Premier 
Qian Qichen this afternoon attended the opening ceremony of the 
Fifth National Meeting of Representatives of Returned Overseas 
Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese. He made a 
congratulatory speech in which he said that the broad masses of 
returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and 
Overseas Chinese have the fine tradition of loving their country 
and their native places, have extensive contacts overseas and 
abundant information resources, and are an important force for 
China's modernization. Thus, they can definitely make a big 
contribution to the great undertaking of invigorating the 
Chinese nation and the reunification of the motherland. 
  Qian Qichen said that returned Overseas Chinese, relatives 
of 
Overseas Chinese, and the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have 
made great contributions to China's revolution and construction 
during the various historical periods; they have added an epic 
chapter to the annals of China's rise and prosperity and the 
Chinese nation's advancement and invigoration. In the new 
historical period, the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese 
and relatives of Overseas Chinese are active in posts in various 
trades. They have eagerly engaged in the undertakings of 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization with a great 
sense of mission and a great sense of responsibility. They have 
scored marked results in promoting China's economic development 
and social advancement and have played an active role in the 
great undertaking of reunification of the motherland. The broad 
masses of Overseas Chinese are most enthusiastic about China's 
opening up to the outside world, about the development of 
economic and trade cooperation between China and foreign 
countries, and about scientific, technological, and cultural 
exchanges. They have joined hands with the peoples of the 
countries in which they reside for progress and they have done a 
great deal of work for the prosperity and advancement of those 
countries and for the development of ties between those 
countries and China. They have devoted themselves to China's 
reform and construction with absolute sincerity. 
  He pointed out that the All-China Federation of Returned 
Overseas Chinese is a people's organization under the leadership 
of the CPC and belonging to the returned Overseas Chinese and 
relatives of Overseas Chinese throughout the country. It is the 
bridge and link through which the CPC and the Chinese Government 
foster ties with the returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of 
Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese. In the new situation, 
the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese has 
heavier duties and its status and functions have become more 
important. The organizations of the All- China Federation of 
Returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must use Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as guidance, uphold the CPC's basic line, 
closely center on economic construction when launching work, 
thoroughly perform their duties, and build the All-China 
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese into a vivid and 
energetic "home of the returned Overseas Chinese" which is 
trusted by the broad masses of people. 
  Qian Qichen said that the party and the government attach 
great importance to the role of returned Overseas Chinese, 
relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas Chinese in 
revolution and construction and that they attach great 
importance to Overseas Chinese work. In the new situation, the 
CPC and the Chinese Government must strengthen and improve 
leadership over Overseas Chinese work, give full play to the 
role of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, 
and enthusiastically care for and support its work. Qian Qichen 
believed that after the meeting of the representatives, a new 
pattern of Overseas Chinese work, one which is characterized by 
unity and bold advancement, will emerge in China.

  [Text] Beijing is to relax its stringent credit controls to 
help solve the so-called "triangular debts" or cash flow 
problems of selected money-losing industries, according to a 
senior Central Bank official. 
  The vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou 
Zhengqing, revealed that plans to save the industries were being 
discussed by various central ministries. The departments 
included the State Economic and Trade Commission and the 
People's Bank of China, the two power bases of Executive 
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  According to Mr Zhou, industries which will benefit from the 
new credit facilities are coal, metallurgy and electricity. 
  It was not clear how much money would be available and when 
the operation would begin. But the vice-governor said the extra 
credit did not mean Beijing would relax its grip on fixed assets 
investment by industries which he described as a "root cause" of 
the cash flow problem. 
  According to original estimates, the Government's ceiling 
for 
fixed assets investment for the country this year was set at 
1,300 billion yuan (HK$1,154 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) -- an 
amount bound to be exceeded. 
  Mr Zhou said the triangular debts problem had arisen, 
because 
industries were unable to obtain a smooth cash flow by selling 
their products on the market. Despite poor sales, many of the 
industries aggravated problems by diverting their working 
capital into fixed assets investment, Mr Zhou said. The bank 
chief said industries must therefore strive to improve sales of 
their products and stop investment in fixed assets while 
triangular debts remained a problem. In addition, the state 
would provide financial assistance to individual industries, he 
said. 
  Informed sources in Beijing said the top leadership was 
worried that, despite years of effort, the triangular debts 
problem continued to hang over enterprises, especially those 
heavy industries in the northeast provinces of Heilongjiang and 
Liaoning. 
  They said senior leaders were worried that many of these 
factories belonged to key national industries and their 
financial situations had apparently not improved while the 
economy boomed. 
  Nevertheless, decisionmakers in Beijing were unable to come 
up with any "breakthrough" measures to rescue these enterprises 
and had to relax credit. 
  Chinese analysts said the Communist Party would hoid a 
plenum 
this year where the viability of state industries would be a top 
priority. 
  The analysts claimed Mr Zhu, highly unpopular for his 
economic retrenchment measures introduced last year, was eager 
to befriend regional governors by promising to relax credit for 
selected industries although the extra money could fuel the 
inflation crisis. 
  "They [the credits] are more a temporary measure than a 
long-term cure," an analyst said.

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "More Firms in Private Sector Set Up"] </F>
  [Text] Private businesses in China continued to grow 
rapidly in the first quarter of this year, thanks to strong 
government support. 
  The number of individually-owned businesses and private 
firms 
expanded by 17 and 14 percent respectively, in the first three 
months this year compared to the same period last year, 
according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
(SAIC). 
  "Private firms" in China are those companies employing more 
than eight people. Those which hire fewer than eight workers 
are called "individually-owned businesses." 
  During the first quarter, 33,500 new firms were set up in 
the 
private sector with 12.9 billion yuan ($1.48 billion) of 
registered capital and a workforce of 480,300. This brings the 
total number of private firms in the country to 271,400 and the 
amount of their registered capital to 81 billion yuan ($9.3 
billion), said a SAIC report. 
  Private firms in towns and cities grew faster than those in 
rural areas, according to the report. 
  Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Sichuan 
and 
Hebei provinces led the expansion of the private sector. Each 
of them now has more than 10,000 private firms. 
  The SAIC report noted that more and more private firms are 
switching over to manufacturing, commerce, consultation, 
catering services, transport and construction projects.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's economy grew 
steadily last month, with soaring prices being put under control 
and production of state-owned enterprises improved, the State 
Statistical Bureau (SSB) announced here today. 
  The SSB index showed that the added value of Chinese 
industries increased by 17.3 percent in May in comparison with 
the same month last year. Production of state-owned enterprises 
turned for the better -- up 5.6 percent on May last year, and 
0,6 percent above the previous month. 
  During the first five months of 1994, the total added value 
of industries amounted to 619.6 billion yuan, 16 percent more 
than in the same period of 1993. 
  A bumper harvest of summer crops is expected by SSB 
officials, who cited favorable weather condition and farmers' 
growing enthusiasm. 
  Effective macro-economic control measures clearly helped 
push 
down soaring investment in fixed assets in May. The index 
indicates that state-owned enterprises invested 67.6 billion 
yuan in the month, down 16.3 percent from April. 
  Investment by state enterprises was 204.4 billion yuan for 
the first five months, up 34.2 percent over the same period last 
year. 
  From January to May, the volume of retail sales totalled 
590.7 billion yuan, a rise of 25.2 percent over last year in 
money terms, which means an actual increase of 4.5 percent if 
inflation is allowed for. 
  In May alone, the figure was 121.4 billion yuan. 
  Exports totalled 9.45 billion U.S. dollars in May, 31 
percent 
up on the same month last year, while imports totalled 9.7 
billion U.S. dollars, a rise of 11.2 percent. 
  In the first five months of this year, China's imports were 
worth 39.28 billion U.S. dollars, 18.1 percent higher than in 
the same period of 1993, while exports jumped by 24.1 percent. 
The trade deficit in the first five months was 1.79 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  SSB officials said that in May, China's financial conditions 
were "basically normal". 
  The government's revenue increased by 33.7 percent in May 
over the same month of last year, while expenditure rose 20.2 
percent. 
  New bank savings amounted to 113.4 billion yuan, 79.4 
billion 
yuan more than in May 1993. 
  A total of 8.5 billion yuan was withdrawn from circulation 
in 
the month. 
  The SSB figures showed that pressure from soaring prices was 
slowly eased. Retail sale prices went up by 18.9 percent over 
May last year, with the increase rate down 0.6 percent from 
April. 
  Economists pointed out that it is still very important to 
bring soaring prices under control. To maintain fast and 
healthy economic development, China should further implement 
macro-economic control policies, impose tighter control of 
prices and sustain proper economic growth.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
is staging a massive training program to produce certified 
public accountants [CPA] across the country to cope with the 
ever-growing demand. 
  "Our target is to produce over 60,000 CPAs in the next six 
years to bring the total number to some 100,000 by the end of 
this century," Vice-Minister of Finance Zhang Youcai told the 
press here today. 
  He said that CPAs will be directly involved in the business 
accounting of some Chinese firms this year. These firms will be 
large state enterprises, conglomerates and large shareholding 
companies. 
  In fact, Zhang said, all business accounting should be 
verified by CPAs in a market economy. But this cannot be 
realised at present since China at the moment only has 38,000 
people with CPA qualifications. 
  According to Zhang, seven Chinese universities will open 
specialized courses of study for CPAs for the first time this 
autumn, with 300 students to be enrolled. 
  The new course of CPA studies will be expanded to more than 
20 colleges and universities next year. 
  Apart from university study, the government will set up 
three 
CPA training centers -- in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The 
centers will begin to operate in two or three years, Zhang said. 
  The Law on Certified Public Accountants which went into 
effect at the start of this year stipulates that anyone who 
wants to obtain a CPA qualification must pass the national 
examinations. 
  China held two such exams in 1991 and 1993. Last year 13 
percent of the 2,900 people who sat the exam obtained CPA 
qualifications. 
  The government will make the exam an annual practice and it 
will be open to foreigners in addition to people from Hong Kong, 
Macao and Taiwan, beginning this year. 
  People from overseas with Chinese CPA qualifications will be 
allowed to form CPA firms on the mainland on a partner basis, 
according to Zhang.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Ministries of 
Agriculture and Chemical Industry Tuesday [14 June] signed an 
agreement on wide-ranging co-operation in developing and 
promoting pesticides and chemical fertilizer. 
  The two ministries will also exchange information on issues 
such as the production of pesticides and chemical fertilizer, 
the acreage of crops and forecasts for plant diseases and insect 
pests, the agreement states. 
  They will probe new ways and means to scientifically apply 
fertilizer and pesticides so as to raise their utilization rate 
and reduce production costs. 
  According to the agreement, they will link the chemical 
fertilizer plants and the agricultural sector more closely as 
producer and consumer, by facilitating the circulation of 
chemical fertilizer and pesticides. 
  Meanwhile, the two ministries, in co-operation with other 
departments, promised to bolster market supervision and 
management, and halt the manufacturing and circulation of fake 
and low-quality products. 
  Also stated in the agreement is that the two ministries will 
help develop rural and township chemical plants, especially 
those in central and western China, and encourage them to 
conduct technical exchanges and co-operation with their 
state-owned counterparts. 
  Signed by Liu Jiang and Gu Xiulian, the respective 
ministers, 
the agreement is sponsored by the State Council, which says it 
is conducive to the progress of agriculture and the 
agro-chemical industry. 
  Official statistics show that the use of pesticides has 
enabled China to make 30 billion yuan (about 3.4 billion U.S. 
dollars) in direct economic benefits every year. 
  The damage caused by plant diseases and insect pests are 
inclined to be heavy this year, and some 210,000 tons of 
pesticides are needed nationwide, according to official 
forecasts. 
  An official at the Ministry of Chemical Industry said that 
the ministry is now making every possible effort to guarantee 
the supply of all sorts of pesticides.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- On the first day of 
February this year, when newly-appointed director of the money- 
losing Shanghai No. 12 Woolen Textile Mill Wan Deming assumed 
office, he was chased by crowds of creditors and workers asking 
for payment. 
  Within one month Wan had cleared up the debts and the mill 
had earned a net profit of 90,000 yuan. In the second month 
this had risen to 180,000 yuan and in the third to 500,000 yuan. 
  The 56-year-old Wan attributed this success to his 
experience 
at the Shanghai no.2 woolen textile mill, a noted profit-making 
enterprise where he serves as concurrent director. 
  "The main reason why the No. 12 Woolen Textile Mill had been 
in the red for five years running and lost 61.52 million yuan 
was because its accounts were not in order and a few employees 
fished in troubled waters," said Wan who became an apprentice at 
a textile mill at the age of 16 and completed a college course 
through self- study. 
  Soon after Yang Guangjie from the Shanghai No. 25 Cotton 
Textile Mill, a profit-making enterprise, became the head of the 
Shanghai Hongzhang Cotton Textile Mill, he was mocked and left 
out in the cold. Many professional skilled workers had 
transferred to other work units. 
  While reforming the labor and income distribution systems by 
selecting and putting talented people in important positions, 
Yang concentrated on developing new products and setting up 
joint ventures in co-operation with Hong Kong and Taiwan 
business people. 
  As a result, the mill has resumed its vitality, and the 
average employees' wages are expected to reach the middle or top 
levels of Shanghai's textile industry this year. 
  To get experienced managers to work in money-losing 
enterprises is one way to help these factories to extricate 
themselves from their difficult position, according to Jiang 
Yiren, vice-mayor in charge of industry. 
  "While supporting state enterprises with better economic 
results," he said, "we must help the struggling ones change 
their operational mechanism and make profits in line with their 
conditions." 
  By the end of last November Shanghai had 277 money-losing 
state enterprises, accounting for 28.9 percent of its total. 
  "The general debility of state enterprises hampers the 
national economy and the people's livelihood," said Wu Bangguo, 
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC's 
Shanghai Municipal Committee. 
  "State enterprises are the backbone of the national economy, 
and have contributed 80 percent of the state's 500 billion yuan 
tax revenues over the past four decades," he said. "Shanghai's 
economy can hardly develop without these enterprises." 
  Under the old central planning system state enterprises used 
to make products according to the plans of the government, which 
offered them production materials and took charge of disposing 
of all the products. 
  As the government encouraged market economy, a number of 
major state enterprises did not known what to do or how to adapt 
to the market. 
  One example is the Shanghai heavy machinery plant, a major 
state enterprise with 10,000 employees, which was at a loss what 
to do and daily getting deeper in debt. 
  It was at this time that the government sent an official to 
the plant to turn it to market-oriented production. 
  "We used to wait for state contracts," a plant official 
said. 
"Now our salesmen positively go out to collect orders and our 
employees voluntarily work extra shifts to fulfil orders ahead 
of schedule. We also offer after-sale service, and the sales 
volume this year is scheduled to reach 600 million yuan-worth." 
  This year 46 money-losing industrial enterprises in Shanghai 
are expected to begin making profits. Meanwhile, some which 
have been in the red for a long time and of which the property 
can hardly pay its debts in kind, will close down, merges with 
other enterprises or go bankrupt.

Political Bureau and secretary of the provincial party 
committee, and Governor Zhu Senlin met with a delegation of 
persons in charge of the Hong Kong newspaper WEN WEI PO in 
Guangzhou yesterday. Zhu Senlin gave an interview to the guests. 
  At the meeting, Xie Fei pointed out: We hope that Hong Kong 
will have a smooth transition in 1997. Stability and prosperity 
are in the interests of both Hong Kong and the mainland as they 
have identical interests. 
  Zhu Senlin remarked: In the last 15 years of reform and 
opening up to the outside world, Guangdong and Hong Kong have 
established very close ties. He maintained that Guangdong and 
Hong Kong can complement each other using their own strong 
points. In the days to come, they can open up new avenues of 
cooperation in two ways: One is that Guangdong and Hong Kong 
can join hands to develop the international market and the other 
way is that in finance, Hong Kong's strong point as a financial 
center should be utilized to do an ever better job of raising 
funds. This will help to raise funds promptly for Guangdong's 
economic construction and provide support in funds for the 
province's effort to set up enterprises abroad.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 15 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province plans to hold investment-promotion talks 
especially for the mountainous counties from August 18 to 24 
this year. 
  The province will also hold an exhibition of poverty-relief 
achievements made in the mountainous areas in the past ten years. 
  Guangdong has 50 mountainous counties, making up 65 percent 
of the whole territory of the province and 42 percent of the 
province's population, and among which 31 counties are below the 
poverty level. 
  To help these areas shake off poverty, the provincial 
government has granted broad preferential treatment to the most 
destitute areas. 
  From 1985 to 1993, the total agricultural and industrial 
product value of the 50 mountainous counties has increased by 
four times and the average annual income of the farmers has 
doubled to 1,250 yuan. 
  The investment environment of the mountainous areas has also 
been vastly improved in the past few years. Several railroads 
and highways have been built across the areas. Roads through 
the 50 mountainous counties now total 33,000 km. 
  Meanwhile, all 50 counties have installed program-controlled 
telephones. 
  These areas are also rich in labor and natural resources, 
such as forests, minerals, rocks and hydropower.

and special reporter Lin Kang-hai (3651 0474) from Haikou, 9 
June: "Hainan Province Decides To Inject Fresh Motive Power to 
Its Economic Construction"] 
  [Text] Ruan Chongwu, chief administrative executive of 
China's youngest province and biggest special economic zone, 
concurrently secretary of the provincial party committee, gave a 
special interview to these reporters here a few days ago. He 
pointed out: This year, while development and reform are in a 
crucial stage, the provincial government will pay close 
attention to the consolidation and implementation of the series 
of reform measures which the central and Hainan provincial 
authorities have promulgated. Great efforts will be made to 
organize the implementation of those moves by proceeding in an 
orderly manner, and step by step, and motive power will be 
injected continuously to ensure the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of Hainan's economy. 
  Governor Ruan said: Various major reforms centering on the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure have been 
introduced. Moreover, Hainan has its own concrete reform 
measures, such as the establishment of a company system in 
state-owned enterprises, opening of the property rights trading 
market, the introduction of a modern tax collection and 
management system, and improvement of the open foreign economic 
structure. These measures involve an extremely wide range of 
endeavor and their implementation is a task of primary 
importance. When answering the question of how to absorb 
foreign capital more vigorously as macroregulation and control 
are applied, the Governor said: "Hainan has its unique strong 
point, which no other cities in the country have. We are 
pursuing the practice of issuing visas at the airport to provide 
the greatest convenience to foreign businessmen and ensure that 
they can leave the country from other ports. Our preferential 
policies on investment and taxation will remain unchanged, as 
will our relaxed investment environment. If there is any change 
it will be to make it even more appealing. We will also 
transform our government functions, reduce the number of 
`keepers [ba men di 2116 7024 4104],' and we will not set up any 
customs barriers, namely, we will reduce examination and 
approval procedures and increase the number of people `engaging 
in hygiene [gao wei sheng di 2269 5898 3932 4104].' To put it 
another way, while acting in accordance with the laws governing 
the market economy, we will practice standardized management and 
supervision." This outstanding student, who graduated from the 
Automotive Machinery College in Moscow, displayed his ability to 
skillfully summarize things. This simple and vivid analogy was 
an embodiment of the Hainan Government's general line of 
thinking on reform and has attracted the attention of economic 
theorists and journalists and has received the approval of 
governments at all levels and the relevant departments in the 
province. 
  Full of confidence, Governor Ruan said: "Hainan encourages a 
free flow of personnel, funds, and commodities. In Hainan, 
there are many opportunities to make money and reap quick 
profits, with the average rate of returns amounting to 20 to 30 
percent. I believe that so long as `there are people making 
money here, others will follow suit.' More and more foreign 
businessmen have set foot on the soil of Hainan and increased 
amounts of funds have flowed into Hainan. This is the best 
proof of my argument. Last year, Hainan signed 316 new 
contracts on foreign capital utilization, an increase of nearly 
83 percent over the previous year." 
  When talking about this year's tasks, this No. 1 man in 
Hainan said: "This year we will continue to uphold the 
principle of infrastructures going first and strengthen the 
construction of infrastructures. We will transform ports, 
construct railways and expressways, build Haikou's Meilan 
Airport, and develop the electric power, post and 
telecommunications, oil refining, construction materials, 
steelmaking, and food processing industries as well as 
tourism.... There are too many things for us to do." 
  With a feeling of joy and a proper sense of pride, Governor 
Ruan informed these reporters: "In the last two or three years, 
Hainan's gross domestic output value has increased at an average 
annual rate of close to 23 percent, more than 10 percentage 
points over the nation's average growth rate. This is a world 
record. This year we will maintain a growth rate of 18 percent 
so that Hainan's economy forges ahead in a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy way." 
  When asked about his feelings regarding his management of 
Hainan affairs, this current magistrate of Hainan Island, who 
has previously been China's labor and public security ministers, 
said: "I have a deep love for Hainan, which is an island 
clinging to the Chinese land and to which the central 
authorities have attached ever greater importance. It is a 
treasure island which finds favor in the eyes of more and more 
farsighted people. With its abundant natural resources, 
tropical beauty, and relaxed investment environment, Hainan has 
become an ideal place, attractive to both investors and 
tourists. I am fully hopeful about Hainan."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Hongfan (6774 2347 5400): "`The </F>
Pearl of Taihang' Has Become Even More Splendid--Linzhou People 
Have Completed Another `Red Flag Canal' Project"] 
  [Text] Henan Province's Linzhou City (formerly Linxian), 
is located on the eastern slopes of Mount Taihang, at the 
conjunction of three provinces, namely, Henan, Shanxi and Hebei. 
Its terrain is mountainous and covered with thousands of steep 
ridges and peaks. 
  The area was formerly an impoverished county, severed from 
the rest of the country by its poor transportation conditions, 
lack of resources, thin layer of soil over its rocky fields, and 
with water as costly as oil. In the wake of reform and opening 
up, Linzhou people have brought forth their past "Red Flag 
Canal" spirit, and scored new accomplishments under the 
leadership of party organizations at various levels. At the end 
of 1993, the city's gross output value was 4.89 billion yuan and 
its financial revenue ranked among the advanced in Henan; a 
favorable balance in savings deposits of urban and rural 
residents was 2.77 billion yuan, topped the whole province. The 
city's comprehensive purchasing power jumped from 44th place in 
1990 to 12th in the province. 
  In their march to mount a new economic plane and achieve 
comparatively well-to-do living standards, Linzhou City has 
persisted in "doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching 
equal importance to both," reaping a bumper harvest in building 
both material and spiritual civilizations. The running water in 
the Red Flag Canal clearly reflects the new image of the Linzhou 
people devoting themselves without reservation to accomplishing 
the task, making efforts to progress, and being prosperous and 
civilized in the 1990's. 
<H5>  Never Give Up the Soul of the Nation </H5>
  Talking about Linzhou people, we naturally associate them 
with the Red Flag Canal, which is their pride and joy and an 
immortal monument. 
  It was in the three years of natural disasters during the 
1960's, under the circumstances whereby the 200,000 residents of 
the locality were allowed a daily ration of only 300 grams of 
grain, using the strength of carrying poles and their own bare 
hands, they leveled out 1,250 hills, built 157 aqueducts, dug 21 
tunnels, and completed an artificial canal, the Red Flag Canal, 
which was 1,500 km long. This tied a silvery ribbon around the 
waist of Mount Taihang, bringing in the waters of the Zhang He. 
  Linzhou people in the 1990's have become well-off and their 
concepts have been rethought. Confronted with the current of 
reform and opening up and the pounding from the commodity 
economy, does the past pioneering spirit of hard work with 
perseverance continue to shine along the Red Flag Canal? Mao 
Wanchun, Linzhou City CPC Committee secretary told this 
reporter: "The Red Flag Canal spirit is a tremendous source of 
wealth for us. We must bring forth the pioneering spirit of 
hard work with perseverance to strive for a new `Red Flag Canal' 
project for construction, reform, opening up, and economic 
development." 
  Anyang Dafang Ceramic Company Ltd., was the first 
joint-venture with Chinese and foreign investment in this small 
city and there was a very heartwarming story in the course of 
its development. 
  On 18 June 1993, a team of Italian experts involved in the 
joint-venture arrived in Linzhou to install equipment, making 
slight of the long journey. When they saw that two presses, 
each weighing 50 tonne and 6m in height were still to be 
positioned, they asked the factory to order the services of a 
70-tonne crane. 
  There were no 70-tonne cranes in Linzhou, not even in the 
Anyang areas. When the factory director Hou Yonghe told the 
Italian team that he had decided to position the machines using 
manpower, an Italian expert said bluntly: "The conditions for 
installing the machines basically do not exist in this place; 
the positioning will take a very long time. We will return to 
Italy first and come back again in six months time to install 
them." With these words, they went straight back to the guest 
house. 
  To win time, Hou Yonghe followed them to the guest house, 
and 
explained to them the possibility of positioning the equipment 
by manpower; however, the foreign experts shook their heads, 
because never in their lives had they witnessed such an action 
and they had been to every part of the world. At last, Hou 
Yonghe entreated; "Please give me three days; if we fail to 
position the presses by the end of three days, I will personally 
see you off at the Zhengzhou Airport!" 
  The foreign experts laughed at this, and the team leader 
said: "Three days, Mr. Hou? I don't think it possible even if 
you have 10 days! If you succeed in positioning them in three 
days, I will give you a $1,000 reward to show my appreciation!" 
  Although time was won, the director's heart was heavy. 
  There was no retreat, they had to cross the Rubicon; it was 
time to test the Chinese will. A crack team comprising more 
than 20 workers was formed. They borrowed six 50-tonne screw 
jacks, four 20-tonne pulleys, and 200 railway sleepers from 
another factory. Thus, the 50-tonne equipment was moved upward 
inch by inch, and forward millimeter by millimeter. It took 
them 38 hours to fulfill the task; none of the workers left the 
work site, and the factory director did not shut his eyes for a 
wink of sleep; consequently, the two mammoths were positioned, 
the whole process was likened to "ants gnawing at a bone." 
  At the guest house, the interpreter repeated the message 
twice, but the Italian experts remained doubtful. It was not 
until they arrived at the work site in the workshop, when Mr. 
Piarener, the technological executive witnessed the result with 
his own eyes, that he suddenly hugged Hou Yonghe, and said with 
admiration: "That is unbelievable, really unbelievable! 
Linzhou people are swell!" The Italian experts were totally 
convinced and promptly contacted their general executive and the 
decision was made to invest more in Linzhou to build a second 
and third production line. 
  Today, the pioneering spirit of hard work is often thought 
and talked about among Linzhou's cadres and masses; furthermore, 
new essences of the spirit are found through constantly talking 
about it. Hou Yonghe said: "Through practice in running a 
joint-venture with Italian investment, we have come to a 
profound understanding that the pioneering spirit of hard work 
hard with perseverance is also in the investment climate." Wang 
Fasui, party branch secretary of Yaochun Town's Shijiahe 
village, said: "The pioneering spirit of hard work with 
perseverance we refer to today is not confined to living a 
frugal life and being willing to contribute one's greatest 
efforts to work; the more important point is a spirit of 
"dauntless persistency," being bold in blazing new trail, 
developing an undertaking, working with perseverance, and making 
progress in a scientific way." On five occasions, Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Li Changchun has been to 
Linzhou to conduct surveys and summarize experiences. He said: 
"The pioneering spirit Linzhou people shaped in the course of 
building the Red Flag Canal, being continuously enriched in the 
period of reform and opening up, embodies the combination of our 
fine national spirit and the modern idea of reform and opening 
up and making concrete the great pioneering spirit of the new 
period advocated by General Secretary Jiang Zemin; it is the 
crystallization of the national soul of the Chinese nation." 
<H5>  Use the Best "Steel" To Make the Knife's Edge </H5>
  In the past, Linxian was synonymous of poverty and 
backwardness but, with today's economic development, Linzhou's 
financial "cake" has become ever larger; consequently, the 
purses of ordinary people have become fatter with each passing 
day. When they briefed visitors in tunr on the splendid 
accomplishments of the Red Flag Canal, they were proud of the 
fact that the favorable balance in savings deposits of Linzhou 
residents topped the province. 
  It is true that poverty does not spell socialism. The more 
precious is the fact that as Linzhou people advance on the path 
to becoming comparatively well-off and prosperous, their fine 
tradition of being diligent and thrifty and working hard with 
perseverance has been sustained; they are spending the precious 
wealth they have created through their own diligence on those 
projects whereby a whole generation or several generations will 
benefit. 
  Members of Linzhou City's leading bodies at various levels 
took the lead in sharing and paying for their meals with the 
masses in their homes. 
  People from Shijiahe village who became well-off have all 
moved into rows of country-villa-style two-story houses. They 
have digital telephones and closed-circuit television installed 
in addition to a central water supply and their children are 
entitled to free nine-year compulsory education. It is a 
billion-yuan village and is famous far and wide. However, in 
this very same billion-yuan village, there are only four cars, 
all public owned and used exclusively to receive or send off 
experts and professors or other guests invited to the village. 
When village-run factory directors are on an errand, they take 
the bus to Anyang and then take a train. When they were out of 
town on errands, almost every one would take pancakes and 
noodles for meals, and book the cheapest hotel rooms which 
charge under 20 yuan. 
  Dingjiao Village ranks sixth in Henan's economic 
construction 
at village level and is one of Linzhou's richest villages. 
Here, when young people get married, the popular way of 
celebration is "eating from the same big pot." On a wedding 
day, one huge pot is used to prepare steamed rolls and rice, 
with another huge pot used to cook vermicelli, meat, bean curd, 
and vegetables. Together with the guests, mostly neighbors, the 
bridegroom and bride of the day will be given a bowl of rice or 
steamed rolls along with a bowl of the hotchpotch, it is simple 
but lively and exciting. Li Chunsheng, the village party 
branch deputy secretary said: "It isn't that we cannot afford 
it but we just do not go in for ostentation and extravagance. 
It is not our way. Now that we are well-off, we have not 
become extravagant in our weddings or funerals." 
  Linzhou people who take the long-term view, think not only 
of 
themselves but of others since they became well-off. Their 
focus of attention is placed not only on the present but more on 
the future. Regarding some social welfare undertakings and 
matters involving long-range interests, people in the hometown 
of the Red Flag Canal have always shown an easy generosity. 
  In Linzhou, there are far too many examples of ordinary 
people and incidents of donating funds or making investment in 
running educational undertakings. Perhaps the statement by Li 
Guangyuan, Dingjiao Village CPC Committee branch secretary 
summarizes the idea they share: "Should we farmers, who cannot 
possibly clear all the mud from ourselves, want to become rich 
and be so forever, we must rely on talented people." 
  Elderly Song Qisheng of Chengguan Town's Beiguan village, 
donated the bulk of his 300,000-yuan lifetime savings, as his 
old age actually approached, to build a three-story school 
building with a floor space of 1,400 square m, which he 
personally designed and oversaw its construction. He left it to 
the small mountain village which had nurtured him before he 
passed away. This "Qisheng School Building" now has some 650 
county children in 10 classes. 
  At Linzhou City Educational Commission, this reporter 
learned 
that, by the end of 1993, the city had collected 220 million 
yuan in educational funds, of which 150 million yuan came from 
voluntary donations from society and the masses; 718 persons 
made donations ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 yuan, 82 persons 
donated over 10,000 yuan, and the highest donation was 490,000 
yuan. 
  Covering the various villages in Linzhou, this reporter 
found 
that the best buildings were the schools. According to a 
briefing, some 440 brand-new schools have built here; 
consequently, entrance examinations for high school enrollment 
were abolished. The school building in Hejian Town's 
Beixiaozhuang enjoys a reputation as "the Presidential House" 
because of its most up to date design. Some 96 pupils from 
Linzhou First Primary School were awarded with national prizes 
in the "National Olympic in Mathematics for Primary School 
Pupils." Su Qishu told this reporter: "Presently our city is 
building a school for the deaf and dumb, so that the handicapped 
can receive a regular education. Although the city finances are 
not sufficiently ample, the city would rather be thrifty in 
other areas than spare money on education; we want to use the 
best steel to make the knife's edge." 
  Writing a New Chapter on Common Prosperity 
  In front of the Dingjiao Industrial General Company's office 
building in Dingjiao village, Yaochun Town, Linzhou City stands 
a quasi-bronze statue of an ox willingly serving the masses; it 
is bending its back as it forges ahead and is a magnificent 
piece. Li Guangyuan, Dingjiao Village general party branch 
secretary, concurrently Dingjiao Industrial Group General 
Company manager said: "There is some foundation to our economic 
development but we must continue to work hard. We communists 
just follow the example of the ox in guiding the masses to 
advance toward common prosperity. 
  Because a number of such willing and had-working people have 
persisted in a correct orientation, Linzhou is taking a broad 
avenue toward common prosperity in building a new order for the 
socialist market economy today. In the vanguard marching along 
this avenue, communists have composed a symphony about working 
hard with perseverance, always being ready to devote themselves, 
and cherishing and working for the people through their actions. 
  Shibanyan used to be the remotest and most backward 
township, 
located at the highest altitude above sea level in Linzhou. A 
folk song has it: "Rocks on the road are as large as oxen; 
mountain floods have left gullies everywhere; people worry while 
riding bicycles or traveling on foot; and the most dreadful 
thing is the meeting of two cars going in opposite directions." 
Because of its natural conditions, when 10,000-yuan households, 
billion-yuan villages, and star towns surfaced among people in 
other localities down the mountain, the masses here could only 
just manage to have sufficient food and clothing. 
  Yhe Linzhou party organization did not put Shibanyan 
Township 
out of its mind. In 1992, the city party committee organized an 
effective leading body for the township; again, in 1993, the 
township was opened up as the city's special experimental zone 
for economic development, while allowing it various preferential 
policies and giving the green light to Shibanyan's economic 
development. When this reporter arrived in the township on a 
rainy day, he saw the roads here had been widened, with electric 
wires and telephone lines installed; enterprises in townships 
and towns along with the tourist industry were on the rise; 16 
enterprises from Hong Kong, Zhengzhou, and Anyang came to this 
"most exciting place" and to date 15 million yuan in investment 
funds have been received. Today, Shibanyan is gradually being 
reinvigorated in its takeoff. 
  In Linzhou's villages, which have became prosperous one 
after 
another, the communists there always have the masses and 
collectives in mind and they are doing their best to fulfill 
their communist duties, portraying a new generation of Linzhou 
heroes. 
  Wang Fasui, Shijiahe village party branch general secretary, 
concurrently general manager of Shijiahe Enterprise Group 
General Company, together th his partners was entitled to 
receive a percentage of the profits of 1.27 million yuan when 
the first round of contracted projects was completed. Should 
they keep the money to themselves or invest it as a collective 
accumulation in reproduction? Wang said: "It would be telling 
a lie to say that the huge sum did not move us. However, we 
communists should have loftier ideals. The enterprises in the 
village have only just started and we communists should not 
think only of our own personal gain. The more important point 
is to lead the masses to work hard to make progress and realize 
common prosperity." In the end, Wang Fasui convinced his 
partners and resolutely donated the whole sum to the village. 
  In his briefing, Di Jianzhou, Yaochun Township party 
committee secretary said that Li Jingyuan, a party member from 
Lijiagang Village started building a casting workshop after his 
demobilization from active service and was capable of making a 
profit of 100,000 yuan each year. In 1991, the villagers 
unanimously elected him village party branch secretary, with an 
annual wage of only 6,000 yuan. Put to the test of money and 
interest, Li Jingyuan said: "Despite the fact that I personally 
have become well-off, the villagers have not. The masses have 
faith in us communists. Under such circumstances, we must guide 
the masses to eradicate poverty and forge ahead to become 
comparatively well-off." Today, 80 percent of peasants in 
Lijiagang are living in two-story houses, every villager is 
exempted from various charges, and Lijiagang has become the 
third "wealthy household" among the town's some 50 
administrative villages. 
  It is precisely because there are hundreds of fine elements 
like Wang Fasui and Li Jingyuan that Linzhou, the brilliant star 
of building the material and spiritual civilizations, has risen 
over the Central China Plain. The responsible persons from the 
province's 17 prefectures and cities, county party committee 
secretaries from its 118 counties, and 2,500 party branch 
secretaries from impoverished villages have all visited Linzhou. 
Since the second half of 1993, they have arrived in Linzhou in 
turn to be baptized by the Red Flag Canal spirit. The 
reinvigoration of a city and an area is not all the Linzhou 
people are after and it is their wish that everyone will become 
well-off. 
  Mount Taihang has endowed Linzhou people with the boldness 
of 
vision and the courage to overcome difficulties and the Red Flag 
Canal water has nurtured their pioneering spirit of working hard 
with perseverance. Linzhou, the pearl of Taihang, will become 
even more splendid in the future.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Soul of the Nation, Pride of the </F>
Times--on the Spirit of Lizhou People for Doing Arduous and 
Pioneering Work"] 
  [Text] The item entitled: "`The Pearl of Taihang' Has 
Become Even More Splendid--Linzhou People Have Completed Another 
`Red Flag Canal' Project" carried in this paper today, records 
and narrates the Linzhou people's inheriting and bringing 
forward the fine tradition of working hard with perseverance in 
pioneering and their feats in reaping a bumper harvest in both 
the material and spiritual civilizations during the new 
historical period of building the socialist market economic 
structure. The article is exciting and enlightening. 
  The pioneering spirit of working hard with perseverance is 
the concrete embodiment of the traditional virtues of the 
Chinese nation as well as the quintessence of the pioneering 
spirit Comrade Jiang Zemin advocates during the new period. It 
has crystallized the national soul and sparkles with the light 
of the times. Materialist dialectics tells us that the basic 
impetus pushing the development of things lies in their internal 
movement of contradiction; the internal cause is the grounds for 
change, whereas the external cause is the conditions for the 
change. That being the case, the pioneering spirit of working 
hard with perseverance is applicable not only to those areas 
where the natural conditions are bad but also to other areas and 
trades; it is applicable not only to past years wherein the 
planned economy was mainly practiced but also today, when we are 
developing the socialist market economy and conducting 
modernization. True, the economic growth rate and the work 
accomplishments of a locality or department depend on their 
objective conditions. However, more importantly, they also 
depend on the efforts of the cadres and masses in the locality 
or department as to whether or not they boast the pioneering 
spirit of working hard with perseverance and going all out to 
make the country strong, as Linzhou's cadres and masses have 
displayed. Should cadres and masses work in concert, engage in 
their undertakings with one heart and soul, and follow the 
example of Linzhou in building a new project akin to the "Red 
Flag Canal" in reform, opening up, and economic development, 
those places with poor natural conditions will also become 
prosperous! 
  Currently, China is in a period in which the new structure 
is 
replacing the old, reform is in a stage of tackling bottlenecks 
to resolve problems at deeper levels, and with greater scope in 
economic construction undertakings, hence the tasks are more 
arduous. This precisely calls for powerful political insurance 
and spiritual pillars. Compared with the past, our material 
conditions are now much better; however, should we be content 
with things as they are, not seek to make progress, forget the 
spirit of devotion, and give up the fine tradition of working 
hard with perseverance, we will lose the powerful spiritual 
impetus and we will bring extremely great losses to our cause. 
  To bring forth the pioneering spirit of working hard with 
perseverance, party organizations at various levels must give 
full play to the role of a fighting bastion and the broad party 
members should play an exemplary role in taking the lead. For a 
long time, the mayor of Linzhou has precisely persisted in 
augmenting building party organizations at various levels, with 
party members taking the lead in playing an exemplary role. For 
the masses' common prosperity, Linzhou's Communists would rather 
sacrifice their personal interests to lead the masses to work 
hard in pioneering undertakings to strive for common prosperity. 
  We believe that, with such party organizations, and party 
members, and people like those in Linzhou, the pioneering spirit 
of working hard with perseverance will pass from one generation 
to another and the socialist cause of reform and opening up will 
develop vigorously, flourishing with each passing day.

  [Text] Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the autonomous 
regional party committee and chairman of the autonomous regional 
people's congress standing committee, recently conducted 
investigations and study in Xigaze Prefecture. After hearing 
briefings by the prefectural party committee and administrative 
office, Comrade Raidi, first of all, fully affirmed the work 
carried out by Xigaze Prefecture in recent years. He said: 
Under the prefectural party committee's unified leadership, and 
thanks to the joint efforts of the party, government, military, 
police, and people, Xigaze showed significant improvements in 
its work over the past few years, scoring tremendous results in 
all fields of work. Specifically, it has done plenty of fruitful 
work in carrying out reform, in opening up to the outside world, 
in developing the economy, in fighting against separatism, in 
keeping the situation stable, and in fortifying border defense, 
and has achieved notable results. The party's basic line of 
"one center and two basic points" has been implemented with 
fairly good results in Xigaze Prefecture. On the whole, the 
prefectural party committee and people's government are 
satisfied with and full of confidence in the work carried out by 
Xigaze Prefecture. 
  Next, Comrade Raidi offered a six-point opinion regarding 
the 
work in Xigaze Prefecture. 1) We should fully understand Xigaze 
Prefecture's important status. Xigaze Prefecture has 
historically been a strategic place which occupied an important 
position. Even now, it still enjoys a decisive position in the 
region. It takes up over one-third of the region's 
approximately 4,000-km border. Nine of the region's 22 border 
counties, or over one-third of the total, are in Xigaze. More 
than one-quarter of the region's 2.3 million-plus population, or 
580,000 people, live in Xigaze. Xigaze occupies more than 1 
million mu of farmland, or one-third of the region's 3.3 
million-plus mu of farmland. Of the region's more than 22 
million head of livestock, Xigaze Prefecture owns more than 5.6 
million head, or over one-quarter of the total. Xigaze 
represented one-sixth of the region's 1993 total annual value of 
goods and services, which amounted to more than 3.6 billion 
yuan. It accounted for approximately half of the region's 1993 
total grain output, which amounted to more than 1.2 billion jin. 
Xigaze Prefecture occupies a very important position in the 
region in many other fields. Besides, the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery 
and other major temples are also located in Xigaze. Xigaze 
enjoys an even more prominent position in the realms of religion 
and traditional culture. For this very reason, the manner in 
which Xigaze carries out work, whether the situation in Xigaze 
is stable, whether the economy can be developed, and whether 
people's lives are improving constantly have a direct bearing on 
the entire prefecture. Those of you who work at the prefectural 
party committee and administrative office should fully 
understand this point. You should truly understand the 
importance of improving Xigaze Prefecture's work from overall 
and strategic perspectives, and clearly recognize the heavy 
responsibility on your shoulders. On the basis of current 
achievements, you should lead people across the region to raise 
Xigaze's work to a new high through the joint efforts of the 
party, government, military, police, and people. 
  2) We should further clarify the guiding ideology for our 
current work. A clear guiding ideology holds the key to 
improving work in a locality or department. This year, the CPC 
Central Committee has laid down a 22-character guideline for 
carrying out the entire party's work: seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability. This 22-character guideline fits the 
national reality completely, and certainly, it fits Tibet's 
reality completely. It is the basis on which we consider things 
and set our guiding ideology, as well as a general demand which 
we must meet in carrying out various fields of work. In my 
opinion, there are two basic aspects in applying this 
22-character guideline to Tibet's reality. First, we should 
correctly handle the dialectical relationship between stability, 
reform, and development. While representing tasks in three 
areas, these three factors are closely interconnected and 
mutually supplementary. Without political stability, we cannot 
speak of reform, and without reform and opening up, we cannot 
speak of development. Comrade Xiaoping clearly defined the 
relationship between these three factors long ago. The 
relationship between these three factors can be simply described 
as follows: Stability is the premise, reform is the driving 
force, and development is the foundation. So long as we 
properly handle the relationship between these three factors, we 
will identify the major contradictions in setting our guiding 
ideology, and will not deviate significantly from that ideology. 
This is true for the entire region as well as Xigaze Prefecture. 
  Second, we should steadfastly uphold the principle of 
performing two tasks simultaneously. Xigaze Prefecture is at 
the forefront of fighting against separatism, safeguarding the 
motherland's unity, and fortifying border defense. It is of 
great importance to fight against separatism, keep the situation 
stable, and fortify border defense while carrying out reform, 
opening up to the outside world, and developing the economy. 
This not only has a bearing on Xigaze Prefecture's stability 
and development but also on the region's overall situation. 
  3) We should make even greater strides in reform and opening 
up. Along with the ever-deepening drive of reform and opening up 
across the nation, our region has moved into a crucial phase of 
reform and opening up. Last year and this year saw the 
promulgation of one reform measure after another. 
Implementation of these measures is a crucial step to reach a 
new high in our economic development. All prefectures and 
cities face the formidable task of tackling key reform-related 
problems. According to the general guidelines of the guiding 
ideology and basic principles set forth last year by the fifth 
enlarged plenary session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional 
Party Committee regarding our region's transition to a market 
economy, we must steadfastly build a socialist market economic 
structure which corresponds to the national framework and 
converges with the national structure. We should proceed on all 
fronts while achieving breakthroughs in key areas. Meanwhile, 
we should advance reform prudently and steadily while keeping 
our region's reality in mind, maintaining stability, and giving 
full consideration to our region's realities in various aspects. 
We should also stress efforts to publicize and explain reform 
measures before unveiling them, consider things carefully, carry 
out meticulous ideological work, and implement various measures. 
We should ensure that most people will support the 
implementation of various reform measures, that a new system 
will replace the old one smoothly, and that all reforms will 
proceed successfully. 
  4) We should continue to place great importance on 
agriculture and devote serious efforts to it. Chairman Mao once 
said: We will not panic if we have grain in our hands, and we 
will be happy if we work in a down-to-earth manner. Our country 
is densely populated, and its major concern is to feed its 
people. Accordingly, the party Central Committee and the State 
Council have always set great store by agricultural issues. The 
rural work conference convened by the party Central Committee 
last year renewed the call for the entire party and country to 
take agricultural issues seriously. Judging by our region's 
reality, agriculture and animal husbandry have always occupied a 
very important position in the economy. Agriculture and animal 
husbandry are our region's basic industries, in which some 80 
percent of the region's population work, and whose output value 
accounts for 80 percent of the total industrial and agricultural 
output value. Therefore, we should take agricultural issues 
very seriously. Xigaze Prefecture is a major grain producer in 
our region; its total grain output reached 260,000 tonnes last 
year, or approximately half of the region's output. On the one 
hand, this illustrates Xigaze's success in grain production. We 
should say that Xigaze contributed tremendously to the region. 
On the other hand, it also shows that whether Xigaze Prefecture 
can continue developing its agriculture has a great impact on 
the region as a whole. Therefore, we hope that the prefectural 
party committee and administrative office will work unflaggingly 
and persistently in agriculture and animal husbandry; carefully 
sum up the positive experiences of the past few years in 
agriculture and animal husbandry; actively explore ways to 
further develop agriculture and animal husbandry in the new 
situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure; 
and strive for a new high in agricultural production. 
  5) We should do solid work in keeping the situation stable. 
To keep the situation stable, we should first genuinely solve 
the problem of conception while carrying out some specific tasks 
in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner. I would briefly 
discuss a number of issues which Xigaze should now tackle on a 
priority basis. First, we should tighten border control. With a 
border that extends more than 1,500 km, Xigaze faces very 
formidable tasks in border control. This is especially true 
because most of the region's important border ports are situated 
in Xigaze. How to tighten control represents a very important 
task. Taking one step further toward tightening control and 
plugging as many loopholes as possible are of great importance 
to keeping the situation stable and fortifying border defense. 
Second, we should further strengthen army-civilian and 
police-civilian relations. Chairman Mao once said: If the army 
and the people are united as one, who in the world can match 
them? Xigaze is an important border region where a substantial 
number of troops and armed policemen are stationed. 
Strengthening the relations between the army and police on the 
one hand, and the government and people on the other hand, is of 
great significance. On the local level, we should take the 
initiative to actively and regularly support the army and 
police, give preferential treatment to their dependents, help 
army and police units solve practical problems, and properly 
deal with the phenomenon of lack of coordination between the 
army and people, and between the police and people, while fully 
recognizing the great importance of army-civilian and 
police-civilian relations. 
  We should highly value and carry forward the good 
army-civilian and police-civilian relations which Xigaze 
Prefecture has fostered over the years, and strive to further 
strengthen such relations under the new situation. Third, we 
should properly solve new problems which have cropped up in the 
course of reform. As reform and opening up have deepened, many 
new problems and contradictions have emerged one after another. 
We should fully prepare ourselves mentally for these problems 
and contradictions, and try our best to give priority to our 
work while solving contradictions at the grass-roots level and 
nipping them in the bud. We should also strengthen work in other 
aspects. For example, we should tighten internal control; 
properly carry out ideological education; improve all facets of 
public order; successfully carry out united front, 
nationalities, and religious work; let patriots play their roles 
in keeping the situation stable; strengthen temple management; 
and exercise stronger leadership in keeping the situation stable. 
  6) We should further strengthen the cadre ranks. After we 
have set a clear political line, cadres represent the decisive 
factor. A strong cadre contingent is essential whether in 
reform and opening up or in the fight against separatism. 
Generally speaking, Xigaze has a good cadre contingent; 
however, it must further strengthen its cadres ranks in keeping 
with the new situation and new tasks. This is a long-term, 
strategic task. Currently, we must beef up the cadre ranks in 
accordance with the principle of carrying out two tasks 
simultaneously. On the one hand, we should continue to heighten 
the awareness of cadres, especially those holding leadership 
positions, about the fight against separatism, so that they will 
resolutely resist the infiltration of separatist forces 
operating within and outside the national borders, strengthen 
their basic political stand on safeguarding the motherland's 
unity and strengthening unity among various ethnic groups, and 
clarify some muddled conceptions in both theory and practice. 
We should project an image befitting a Communist or cadre among 
the masses, and ensure that our cadre ranks will be highly 
combat-effective in the fight against separatism. On the other 
hand, we should keep improving the ability of cadres at all 
levels to adjust to the new situation of fostering a socialist 
market economy by seriously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
studying the theory on socialist market economics, acquiring 
modern scientific and general knowledge, and improving their own 
quality. Moreover, cadres at all levels should further improve 
their work style, link theory with practice, foster close ties 
with the masses, diligently and honestly perform their official 
duties, and serve as good public servants. 
  In closing, Comrade Raidi said: The party Central Committee, 
the State Council, and the Central Military Commission show deep 
concern for and attach great importance to the work carried out 
by Tibet. Party, government, and military organizations at all 
levels should make concerted efforts to improve various fields 
of work in Tibet, thereby living up to the high expectations of 
the party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central 
Military Commission.

  [Text] A total of 753 foreign-funded enterprises had been 
registered across the province by the end of last year. In 
order to establish and refine a socialist market economic 
mechanism, the province will step up verification of equipment 
imported by foreign-funded enterprises, as well as assessment of 
assets owned by foreign-funded enterprises. Since last year, 
the province has assessed assets owned by 16 groups of 
foreign-funded enterprises -- including enterprises run with one 
of three types of capital: foreign capital, overseas Chinese 
capital, and with both Chinese and foreign capital -- and has 
verified a total of $3.076 million in assets. 
  Owing to the province's belated asset assessment work, only 
2.1 percent of the province's foreign-funded enterprises thus 
far have participated in the asset assessment process, while 
only 0.5 percent of the province's foreign funds, including 
those invested in enterprises run with three types of capital, 
have been assessed. 
  In order to guarantee continued economic growth and to 
protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors with 
relevant laws, the province yesterday held a work meeting on 
publicizing and implementing a series of foreign investment and 
foreign-owned asset assessment and management measures. 
  Lin Jingxin, provincial commercial inspection bureau chief, 
delivered at yesterday's meeting a speech in which he called on 
all units concerned to vigorously publicize and strictly 
implement the measures drawn up by State Commercial Inspection 
Bureau and Ministry of Finance. Lin urged leaders at all 
levels, foreign-related asset assessment offices, 
foreign-related accounting offices, and other departments 
concerned across the province to attach great importance to, 
actively coordinate with, and vigorously support foreign-related 
asset assessment work.

  [Text] Conducting investigations and study in Shuangyashan 
city, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
pointed out: A prominent task that lies ahead for all people of 
the province is to rapidly turn the advantages of having natural 
resources into those of having commodities. The leaders at 
various levels and the masses should emancipate their mind, 
change ideas, and smash the bonds of the planned economy. 
  On 12 June, accompanied by Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee; and Wang Xianming, secretary 
general of the provincial party committee, Yue Qifeng, secretary 
of the provincial party committee, went to Shuangyashan city to 
conduct investigations and study. He respectively inspected the 
country fair trade town of Jixian County and several 
enterprises, including a marble plant. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Shuangyashan city is an industrial city 
with rich coal resources. So, it is very important for the city 
to grasp coal production. However, an economically strained 
situation will certainly emerge if this city only lays an 
emphasis on coal production at the expense of neglecting the 
development of other industries and diversification of the 
economy. Therefore, we should attach importance to the 
development of the county-level economy but must not simply 
regard the rural areas as an accessory to urban areas. As long 
as the rural economy is well developed, essential changes will 
take place in the overall economic pattern. 
  Yue Qifeng maintained: Up to now, our province has been 
subject to the pattern of a planned economy because although we 
stand by a gold mountain, we live a poor life. Our province's 
wasteland, lakes, and coal fields are important resources. But, 
we do not make good use of them. Our province still fails to 
turn its special products, such as aquatic products and mountain 
products, into advantages of appropriate scale. Therefore, we 
should give free rein to vigorously developing town and township 
enterprises, and mobilize the masses to develop the natural 
resources in stages and then process natural resources 
intensively and precisely. So, the governments at various 
levels should create a favorable environment for town and 
township enterprises, and [words indistinct]. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Town and township enterprises are important 
sources for secondary financial resources. So far, it has been 
necessary to change the current situation so that now 80 percent 
of the province's financial resources are from state-owned large 
enterprises. Heilongjiang will become hopeless if it does not 
develop secondary financial resources. 
  Yue Qifeng stressed: Emancipating the mind, changing ideas, 
straightening out the strategic ideology of economic 
development, being inspired with enthusiasm, making concerted 
efforts, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all fronts is a major 
task ahead of the whole province. Only when we strive to grasp 
and fulfill this task can an overall economic development 
situation possibly emerge in Heilongjiang.

  [Text] Changchun, June 15 (XINHUA) -- About a quarter of 
the income of farmers in northeast China's Jilin Province comes 
from growing special local products, according to a report from 
the provincial trade department. 
  The province's specialities industry earned a total of 3.83 
billion yuan last year, some 25 percent of the total output 
value of its farming sector. 
  Jilin has a good climate for growing some 20 special 
products, including ginseng, mushrooms, flowers, fruits, 
vegetables, frogs, silk and herbs. 
  Over the past few years, it has built 1,207 frog-raising 
centers, with a total output of 680 million frogs worth 300 
million yuan. The areas for growing fruit trees, ginseng and 
flowers have doubled or tripled. 
  Some four major growing projects, including fruit trees and 
vegetables, have earned three billion yuan. 
  About 1.3 million households in the province have developed 
the "courtyard economy", under which farmers make money by 
selling special products they grow in their courtyards or 
gardens. 
  This added 1.1 billion yuan to the farmers' pockets. 
  In Tonghua City, a ginseng home, as it is called by many, 
the 
cash crop planting area last year reached 40,000 hectares, with 
the output value totalling 2.4 billion yuan. The income of 
150,000 farmer households increased by 600 yuan. 
  Farmers in Fusong County also exported a wild herb to 
countries such as Japan, raising their per capita income by 100 
yuan last year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ju Zhijia (72631807 0502): "Strengthen </F>
Management Over Receipts and Stop the Loss of Taxes"] 
  [Text] Take action immediately, strengthen receipt 
management work, and guarantee the smooth implementation of the 
new tax system. This was proposed at the provincial meeting on 
launching a special struggle against the law-breaking and 
criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts 
held in Xingcheng on 18-20 May. 
  Directors of tax bureaus of 14 cities across the province 
attended the meeting. The participants summed up and exchanged 
experiences in dealing blows to fake receipts during the 
previous stage and defined tasks for launching this special 
struggle in the near future. Five models, including Shenyang, 
Anshan, Dandong, Fuxin, and Chaoyang, introduced their 
experiences. 
  The meeting pointed out: If we fail to properly manage 
special-purpose receipts, direct and big losses of taxation of 
the state will inevitably be created and reform of the tax 
system will be a failure. Therefore, tax departments at all 
levels should regard the management of special-purpose receipts 
as an important means for guaranteeing the smooth implementation 
of the tax system reform and enhance the sense of responsibility 
and urgency. Certainly, strengthening management over 
special-purpose receipts does not mean to slacken efforts in the 
management of receipts that are not related to the value-added 
tax. Contrarily, we should step up our efforts to strengthen 
management and inspection in an effort to stop up the loophole 
in the management of tax revenue and financial affairs and 
guarantee that the state taxation and property will not be 
infringed. 
  The meeting held that at present the most serious and 
harmful 
thing reflected in the problem on receipts is the forging, 
reselling and stealing of special-purpose receipts related to 
value-added tax. Using receipts to engage in law-breaking and 
criminal activities such as tax evasion has become a social 
nuisance in society. It affects many sectors, and most of these 
law-breaking and criminal activities are carried out covertly. 
It is not easy to discover and solve this problem by relying 
only on the inspection of tax departments. It is necessary to 
maintain close coordination with the public security, judicial, 
and procuratorial departments and take joint actions. Tax 
departments at all levels, when they discover the law-breaking 
acts of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts during their 
inspection and when these acts constitute a crime, should 
promptly transfer the persons involved to the judicial organs 
for punishment. 
  The meeting stressed: Like we treat the banknotes, we should 
consider strengthening management over receipts as a major 
affair and grasp it firmly and well. We should investigate and 
handle each and every law-breaking and criminal activity of 
forging, reselling, and stealing receipts we discover, 
resolutely check the law-breaking acts of using receipts to 
bring a series of harm to society, and create a good environment 
for the smooth implementation of the new tax system.

  [Text] Hangzhou, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A businessman from 
Taiwan said here today that the trial for murder in the March 31 
Qiandao Lake tragedy has helped the public know the truth of the 
case. 
  Steven Lin, general manager of Soaring Travel Service Ltd. 
of 
Taiwan, said this after listening to the verdict in the 
courtroom this morning. He also listened to court arguments and 
final pleadings of the accused yesterday. 
  Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun were found guilty of 
robbing and murdering 24 Taiwanese tourists and eight mainland 
crew in the boat-fire tragedy on Qiandao Lake in eastern 
Zhejiang Province and sentenced to death by the Hangzhou 
intermediate court earlier today. 
  The 24 Taiwan victims were all part of a tourist group 
organized by Lin's travel service. 
  Lin said that in the process of the trial, "everything was 
dealt with according to law." 
  He has told relevant departments on the mainland that he 
wants to take the recording and video tapes of the trial back to 
Taiwan so that the relatives of the victims can know the details 
of the trial. 
  According to Lin, a very high percentage of tourist services 
in Taiwan focus on business with the Chinese mainland. 
Therefore, he said, the boycott on tourists to the mainland by 
Taiwan authorities since the multiple murder in May has caused 
"great losses" to Taiwanese tourism businesses. 
  "A boycott cannot solve the issue of the Qiandao Lake case," 
he said. He called on the Taiwan authorities to lift the 
boycott during the present peak season so as to revive the 
tourism links with the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] welcomes the U.S. Senate resolution supporting its bid to 
join the United Nations and other international organizations, 
the Ministry of Foreign affairs said Wednesday [15 June]. 
  "We are grateful for the U.S. Senate support and hope the 
U.S. executive branch can implement the resolution," said a 
ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  The resolution, introduced by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and 
unanimously passed by the Senate by voice vote on June 10, says 
the U.S. President, acting through the U.S. permanent 
representative to the United Nations, should encourage the UN to 
permit Taiwan to participate fully in the activities of the UN 
and its specialized agencies. 
  The resolution, printed in the congressional record, also 
says that cabinet-level exchanges between Taiwan and the United 
States should take place in the interests of both nations. 
  The Foreign Ministry official said the resolution is not 
expected to have a strong binding force on the U.S. 
administration at the moment. 
  "Nevertheless, we still hope more similar calls will mount 
in 
the U.S. in the future to support our UN bid and high-level 
Taipei- Washington exchanges," the official said. "If we can win 
the support of the U.S. media and public, we believe the U.S. 
Government will weigh their opinions while dealing with 
Taiwan-related issues." 
  The preamble of the resolution notes that the U.S. has had a 
long histroy of friendship with the Republic of China, that 
Taiwan is now a strong, vibrant economy having the largest 
foreign exchange reserves of any nation, and that Taiwan 
respects human rights and routinely holds free and fair 
elections in a multiparty political system. 
  The preamble further says that Taiwan has much to contribute 
to the work and funding of the UN, and that it is in the 
interest of the U.S. and the UN to maintain good relations with 
a government and an economy as significant as that of Taiwan.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 14 (CNA) -- The Council of Labor 
Affairs at a screening meeting Tuesday [14 June] adopted a 
formula tying the minimum wage to the consumer price index (CPI) 
and labor productivity rate. 
  Aimed to reduce conflicts between management and labor over 
wage hikes, the formula pegs the minimum wage to the CPI 
recorded in the previous year plus half the labor productivity 
growth rate. 
  In 1993, the CPI went up 2.94 percent on a year-earlier 
level 
while labor productivity gained by 3.44 percent, according to 
tallies of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and 
Statistics. 
  The minimum wage therefore will be raised by 4.66 percent, 
the council said, which would make the minimum monthly wage 
NT$13,917 [new Taiwan dollars] (about U.S.$516). A council 
official stressed that the figure would need to be slightly 
adjusted to take into account employees who are paid on an 
hourly or daily basis. The wage hike will take effect on July 1. 
  "The formula is simple and makes the accounting of wage 
hikes 
easy," Tung Tai-chi, the director of the council's labor 
conditions department, said, speaking of the new formula's 
merits. 
  Generally speaking, Tung added, the minimum wage will only 
increase or stay steady in the future. "Even if the CPI and 
labor productivity decline, the minimum wage at most will be 
frozen," he said. 
  Also on Tuesday, Premier Lien Chan approved in principle a 
proposed 3-percent wage hike for government employees, teachers 
and servicemen, also beginning on July 1. The proposal will 
cost the government an estimated NT$11.2 billion.

  [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] will grant $55 million 
to five developing countries according to a ROC high-ranking 
official. Poland will be receiving $20 million; the Philippines, 
Paraguay, and Latvia will each receive $10 million in loans; and 
Vietnam will receive $5 million in loans. The secretary general 
for the Executive Yuan's International Economic Cooperation 
Development Fund, (Chou Yan), refused to disclose the interest 
for these loans. He only said the loan interest for each country 
is different. Chou said this is the first time this year the 
ROC has given out loans to other countries but in the past five 
years Taiwan had already given out $257 million in loans to more 
than a dozen countries. Chou said the purpose for the loans is 
to help these nations to develop their small and medium 
industries and they can later on develop larger industries. The 
ROC's foreign exchange reserves [words indistinct] $86.8 
billion, which is higher than most of the countries in the world.

  [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- After laborious efforts 
and negotiations, Taiwan flower growers finally have persuaded 
Japan to run quarantine checks on Taiwan fresh-cut flowers 
intended for the Japanese market here rather than in Japan. 
  Japanese customs authorities agreed Wednesday [15 June] to 
apply the new quarantine procedure starting at the end of this 
year, according to a Council of Agriculture (COA) official. 
  Currently, all Taiwan fresh-cut flowers are quarantined by 
Japanese customs after arrival there. A majority of the 
flowers, however, are fumigated with methyl bromide after 
failing the stringent Japanese quarantine standards. Most 
flowers exported to Japan are chrysanthemums, but also include 
gladioluses and roses. 
  The fumigation seriously downgrades the appearance and life 
span of the fresh flowers, thus reducing the profits of the 
Taiwan flower growers and exporters, said Chen Chiu-nan, a 
division chief of the COA's food and agriculture department. 
  Once the Japanese officials start conducting quarantine 
checks in Taiwan, fewer fresh flowers will have to be fumigated 
and losses will be minimized, Chen asserted. 
  According to customs tallies, Taiwan exports an average of 
5,200 metric tons of fresh-cut flowers worth U.S.$11.27 million 
a year, of which 5,000 metric tons go to Japan.

  [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- A Kaohsiung-based fishing 
boat is being detained at the port of Madryn in southern 
Argentina for allegedly intruding into that country's 
200-nautical-mile economic zone, fishery officials confirmed 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The "Man Wei No. 111" was caught by an Argentine naval 
patrol 
ship on Saturday, the officials said. The ship was guided to 
Madryn Tuesday for investigation. 
  A CNA dispatch from Buenos Aires, quoted the ship's agent in 
Argentina as saying that the ship and its 28-member crew are all 
in good condition. 
  The report said the satellite location recorder installed on 
the Man Wei No. 111 clearly showed the ship was located at a 
point 201.3 nautical miles off the Argentine coast when it was 
intercepted by the Argentine patrol boat. Moreover, its radar 
was not on, indicating that the ship was not operating. 
  Man Wei's captain, Tsai Tien-fu, had asked Argentine naval 
officers to sign a statement affirming the ship's location 
reading when it was intercepted to show that the boat was in 
international waters, the report said. 
  Argentine naval authorities are still questioning Man Wei's 
crew members for more information about its operations. They 
may ask the Argentine court to make a ruling later this week, 
the report said. 
  Huang Lung-yuan, Taiwan's representative in Argentina, said 
he will provide the Man Wei crew with all necessary support and 
assistance. 
  Meanwhile, fishery administrators said domestic squid prices 
have risen by nearly 60 percent in recent months because of 
dwindling catches. 
  Taiwan's squid catch stands at about 130,000 metric tons so 
far this year, down 30 percent from the year-earlier level, the 
officials said. 
  With fewer catches, the local squid wholesale price has 
climbed to about NT$40 (U.S.$1.48) per kilogram, compared with 
NT$22 (U.S.$0.81) recorded last year. 
  The officials attributed the decrease in squid catches in 
part to a United Nations ban on the use of driftnets in squid 
fishing. Moreover, the officials said, Argentina's attack and 
sinking of a Taiwan fishing boat in waters near its economic 
zone in May also adversely affected Taiwan's squid catches this 
year. 
  As the annual squid fishing season finishes at the end of 
this month, the officials said, domestic squid prices may rise 
further. The unusually strong squid demand in Europe and 
Mainland China this year iy also a reason behind the recent 
price hikes, the officials added.

  [Text] Taipei, June 13 (CNA) -- Beginning Monday [13 June], 
Taiwan consumers will be forced to pay higher prices for books 
translated from foreign-language publications as sales of 
unauthorized translations of such works will become illegal. 
  The revised copyright law, which was passed by the 
Legislative Yuan two years ago under intense pressure from the 
United States, prohibits the publication of unauthorized 
translations of foreign publications. 
  Local publishers have been banned from printing unauthorized 
translations since the new copyright law took effect in June 
1992. They were, however, allowed to sell unauthorized 
translations, which were printed before the law took effect, 
until June 12, 1994. 
  In order to clear out all the soon-to-be-illegal books 
before 
the deadline, local publishers and book dealers launched a 
series of sales in recent months, inspiring an islandwide 
book-buying frenzy. 
  Dealers offered big discounts to attract book buyers. 
Bookstores on Taipei's Chungching South Road were jammed with 
bargain hunters over the weekend to beat the June 12 deadline. 
Many people even came all the way from southern Taiwan to 
Taipei to hunt for reading bargains. 
  From now on, book dealers who display unauthorized 
translations of foreign works on their shelves face up to two 
years in jail. 
  Wang Chuan-lu, chairman of the Copyright Committee under the 
Ministry of the Interior, said Monday that enforcement of the 
new regulation will help Taiwan rid itself of its image as a 
"kingdom of commercial piracy [no closing quotation mark as 
received].

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The National Defense Ministry's Chungshan Science 
Institute, reputed to be the bastion for research and 
development of defense science and technology, will be forced to 
retrench its staff due to reduced programs and fund shortage, 
and it is expected to streamline the existing 18,000-member 
staff down to 9,000 over a period of four years. 
  According to Chao Chih-yuan, vice minister of national 
defense, the institute, in order to continue its capability to 
conduct research and development in defense industry, will 
retain the core defense science and technology personnel. 
  To some sectors of the public who are often skeptical of 
whether weapons and equipment developed by the institute with 
lavish funding can meet the basic defense needs, the elimination 
of superfluous and retention of primary personnel in the 
institute's upcoming staffing streamlining will, at least, save 
expenditure on nonessential personnel and avoid foolish waste. 
However, others are apprehensive that the measure to 
drastically reduce defense science and technology personnel may 
undermine the defense industry's foundation built with hard work 
and affect the country's future capability to develop defense 
industry. 
  The Chungshan Science Institute's personnel reduction plan 
will be carried over a period of four years beginning from 1995. 
The number of current 18,000 staff members will be reduced to 
about 9,000, including 7,000 for the headquarters, 900 for the 
aviation research institute, and 1,300 for the systems 
manufacturing center, while the 5,000-member aviation 
development center will be transferred to the Hanhsiang Company 
and will no longer belong to the Chungshany Science Institute.

  [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- All government agencies 
will join hands to promote the National Information 
Infrastructure (NII) as part of the government's efforts to 
sharpen Taiwan's international competitiveness and to build 
Taiwan into an Asia- Pacific business operation center, a 
cabinet minister said Wednesday [14 June]. 
  Hsia Han-min, a minister without portfolio, said Premier 
Lien 
Chan gave the instruction on the NII program at a Tuesday 
meeting of the information-promotion task force. 
  To effectively promote the NII, also known as the 
"information superhighway," a supraministerial task force and a 
private consultative committee also will be established, Hsia 
pointed out. 
  Hsia, who was appointed to head the task force, pledged that 
the group will seek concerted efforts from both the government 
and the private sector to achieve Taiwan's information 
infrastructure goals. 
  Preliminary estimates show that government investment in 
various information and telecommunications projects might top 
NT$100 billion (U.S.$3.69 billion) in the next six years, he 
said. 
  The investment will have a great impact on the development 
of 
the domestic industrial base and on the well-being of the 
nation, he added. 
  Kuo Yun, president of the Institute for Information 
Industry, 
stressed that the domestic information industry will benefit 
from the NII program because of the host of trade opportunities 
it will bring. 
  The NII, which will use various information and 
telecommunications expertise to quickly transmit words, 
graphics, voices, and visions via computer networks, will 
greatly change lifestyles here, he elaborated. 
  For example, he said, upon completion of the information 
superhighway, students could choose to "attend" school at home 
via computer hookup, and people could engage in activities such 
as watching movies and shopping without going outside.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--PRC Vice 
Premier Li Lanqing said today: President Clinton's decision to 
extend China's MFN treatment is beneficial to both countries. 
However, China hopes that this issue can be settled once and 
for all, which will speed up development of Sino-American 
economic and trade relations in a steady and healthy manner. 
  Li Lanqing said when meeting with the economic and trade 
delegation of the U.S. Chicago Management Association today: 
The only way which lies before us is to enhance our 
cooperation. We should transform past disputes into more 
intensive cooperation and dialogue. He was optimistic about the 
future development of Sino-American relations. 
  Li Lanqing said: The United States is the largest developed 
country, whereas China is the largest developing country. 
Enhancing cooperation will not only benefit our two countries 
and peoples, but will also contribute to world peace, stability, 
and development. 
  Madame (Carina Causkenarrow), general director of the 
Chicago 
Management Association, said: Chicago and U.S. business circles 
are very glad about the settlement of the issue of China's MFN 
treatment, which will maintain the strong business ties of the 
two sides. Our current visit to China is precisely an 
opportunity to discuss trade and investment between the two 
sides. 
  Li Lanqing briefed the visitors on the situation of China's 
economic development. He said: Now that China has opened its 
door, it will open up wider and wider and nothing can close it. 
Hence, China will provide greater and greater opportunities for 
cooperation. He wished that the entrepreneurs from Chicago 
could find new opportunities of investment and cooperation 
through this visit. 
  The Chicago Management Association organized, for the first 
time, a delegation to visit China at the invitation of China 
Council for the Promotion of International Trade. The 
delegation will also visit Shenzhen and Shanghai.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, member of 
the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, delivered a report 
on economic work [as received] at a national education 
conference this afternoon. He said: The national conference is

Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have made important 
speeches to give specific guidance to the conference. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Education remains the focus of China's 
strategy and an important part of China's modernization drive. 
Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on attaching 
importance to education, respecting knowledge, and respecting 
trained professionals, China has scored marked achievements in 
educational work. Leaders at all levels should follow the 
teaching of Comrade Xiaoping and grasp education as if they were 
doing economic work. 
  Zhu Rongji said: The current economic situation in China is 
good. After the introduction of several major reform measures, 
such as the financial and tax reform and the banking reform, 
this year, the basic framework for a socialist market economic 
structure has taken shape in China, and work in this respect is 
progressing smoothly. Along with the development of the 
economy, we will certainly be able to advance China's education 
to a new level through this conference and under the leadership 
of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core.

projects with a total investment of 7.2 billion U.S. dollars. 
Included are 4,800 Sino-foreign projects with a combined 
investment of 4.9 billion U.S. dollars. One third of the 
investment comes from the government. 
  The increased value of the state fixed industrial assets 
last 
year climbed to 73.189 billion yuan, accounting for 78.9 percent 
of the city's total and an increase of 6.638 billion yuan over 
the previous year. 
  Included were 1.516 billion yuan from joint venture and 
joint 
stock enterprises.

  [Text] Chongqing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Xiao Yang, governor 
of southwest China's Sichuan Province, said that Sichuan will 
attract more foreign businessmen through building a large market. 
  At a seminar entitled "International Capital Market and 
Inland Economic Development in China", Xiao said that the most 
important link in economic development lies in correct analysis 
of the capacity of market. 
  He said that the larger a market is, the more funds it will 
attract. 
  He said that Sichuan Province has formed a large market 
involving 400 billion yuan, which has even been regarded as the 
ninth largest market in the world by some American economists. 
  As one of the largest provinces in China, Sichuan occupies 
570,000 square kilometers and has a huge population of 110 
million. It has rich natural and labor resources. 
  The governor said that now Sichuan is expanding its market 
at 
a rate of 10 percent annually. 
  He said that if his province can introduce 2 billion U.S. 
dollars per year, the gross domestic product of Sichuan is 
expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 10 percent. 
  By the end of this century, the gap between the economic 
growth of Sichuan and provinces in coastal regions will be 
markedly narrowed, he said. 
  The governor said that now some large international 
consortiums have begun to invest in basic construction projects 
in the energy and communications sectors. 
  Last year, Sichuan introduced 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in 
foreign funds and approved 1,900 foreign-funded enterprises.

<F P=106> [Roundup by a XINHUA reporter: "Li Denghui's (Li Teng-hui) </F>
Remarks Intended To Split the Motherland Have Aroused Grave 
Concern From the People on Both Sides of the Strait"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 June (XINHUA) -- Of late, Taiwan's 
preeminent power-holder Li Denghui went to some Central American 
countries and South Africa to blow his own trumpet there, trying 
to buy over some people to support Taiwan's "return to the 
United Nations." He unscrupulously spread statements within and 
outside the island intended to split the motherland, attacking 
and vilifying the Communist Party of China [CPC]. What Li 
Denghui has done has aroused grave concern from the people on 
both sides of the strait. 
  From 4 to 16 May, Li Denghui was active in Nicaragua, Costa 
Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland. During this period, he said 
on many occasions that Taiwan "must engage in diplomacy as a 
sovereign country and that Taiwan `will not retreat from its 
stand of joining the United Nations'." He slandered China's 
leaders as having a "rigid concept" (originally from the 
Japanese, meaning "as hard as cement") and even shouted an 
abuse, calling mainland leaders "bandits." Before his visit to 
these countries, during his "frank dialogue" with a Japanese 
writer on the island of Taiwan, he said he would like to talk 
about "the sadness of the Taiwanese people," saying that Taiwan, 
recovered by China from the hand of the Japanese aggressors, had 
been ruled by "a foreign political power," that the call of the 
Chinese communists for cross-strait reunification was "a strange 
rigmarole," and that "the term China is ambiguous." He also 
styled himself as Moses who led the Jews out of Egypt to build a 
new country. He also said he had been a Japanese until he 
reached age 22. On 20 May, when he attended the extraordinary 
meeting of "the National Assembly" in Taiwan, Li Denghui once 
again declared: "One China is our future objective, but it does 
not exist at present." Once again he was selling his so-called 
theory of "two China's," one of which is the "Republic of China 
on Taiwan." 
  Public opinion inside and outside of Taiwan showed that 
these 
splittist remarks by Li Denghui "have truly revealed his true 
features." In recent years some principal power holders in 
Taiwan have switched from pushing "elastic diplomacy" and 
"essential diplomacy" to "pragmatic diplomacy" and "vacation 
diplomacy," and switched from a policy of "two Chinas as a 
phase," raised at the Seattle Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum last winter, to the recently raised policy of "accepting 
dual recognition by South Africa of both sides of the strait." 
This amply shows they are moving toward the path taken by the 
advocates of "Taiwan independence." A columnist on the island 
commented by saying: "In the past, the DPP [Democratic 
Progressive Party] has been publicizing the "Taiwan 
independence" ideal, but this is no longer the DPP's patent. 
What the KMT is doing "pragmatically" now is promoting "Taiwan 
independence." A Hong Kong newspaper, in a signed article, 
points out: Recently Li Denghui "made one rigmarole after 
another; he is distorting history." He said "nonsensically that 
there is the `Republic of China on Taiwan.' Actually, it is 
`independent Taiwan' and is also `Taiwan independence.'" In an 
editorial, Taiwan's LIAN HE BAO [LIEN HO PAO] said: If Li 
Denghui's doctrine of "foreign political power" exists, then it 
is necessary to "smear or revise history." Remarks about "the 
sadness of the Taiwan people" and "foreign political power" are 
originally the principal views of the advocates of "Taiwan 
independence." By taking the lead in "staging this kind of 
show," Li Denghui is trying "to stir up sentiments" and "incite 
enmity." By styling himself as Moses in the Bible, he "is not 
honest with himself." At a discussion meeting, a person from 
the press circle called these remarks of Li Denghui "helpful to 
the `Taiwan independence' movement" and "harmful to the Chinese 
people."

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- Taiwan is making more 
concessions in removing tariff and nontariff barriers in an 
effort to pave the way for the country's smooth entry into the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade, or GATT. 
  Import restrictions on a host of farm products, including 
turkey meat, whole duck and 16 types of fruit, including apples, 
peaches and apricots, will be removed, as will area 
restrictions, according to Council of Agriculture (COA) 
officials. 
  The tariff concessions will be finalized by an 
interministerial GATT strategy task force on Thursday [15 June]. 
The task force originally was to have met later this month, but 
moved the meeting up "because time is pressing." 
  Taiwan is expected to submit a list of its market-opening 
moves before a GATT special working party convenes its sixth 
meeting screening Taiwan's application for GATT membership in 
late July. 
  The task force will also discuss Taiwan's opening up to rice 
imports, the officials added. 
  In liberalizing its rice market, Taiwan will not insist on 
adopting the "Korean formula," which will allow rice imports of 
up to 4 percent of domestic consumption within 10 years, but 
will sacrifice some of its own agricultural production to 
foreign imports. 
  It is likely that Taiwan will take a road midway between the 
Korean and Japanese formulas. The Japanese formula stipulates 
that the country will open 4 percent to 8 percent of its market 
to foreign rice in six years, but without opening up its market 
to other agricultural products. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan officials will hold other tariff-reduction 
negotiations with more GATT member countries in early July 
before the GATT special working party meets. 
  The Taiwan delegation, to be headed by Vice Economics 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng and Board of Foreign Trade 
Director-General Y.C. Huang, will hold bilateral tariff and 
nontariff negotiations at Geneva with officials from Mexico, 
Argentina, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and 
most European countries. 
  Taiwan is also scheduled to hold its third round of trade 
negotiations with the united tstates in mid-July. A ministry 
official said that if the United States finds Taiwan's offer to 
slash tariffs, remove area restrictions and open up the service 
market satisfactory, it would go a long way toward solidifying 
Taiwan's GATT entry.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Tiegang: "Grachev's Caucasus Tour </F>
Fruitful"] 
  [Text] Moscow, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev returned to Moscow on Saturday [11 June] night, 
winding up his four-day fruitful visit to the Caucasus. 
  During the trip, Grachev reached agreement on sending 
Russian 
peacekeeping troops to the Georgia-Abkhazia conflicting zone and 
agreement on building Russian military bases in Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. 
  The Russian minister arrived in Yerevan, the capital of 
Armenia, on Wednesday. There he held talks with Armenian leader 
Levon Ter- Petrosyan on stationing Russian military bases on the 
Armenian territory. 
  As a result of the talks, a Russian motorized rifle division 
and a motorized rifle regiment will remain in the cities of 
Gyumri and Yerevan. Grachev told reporters that there are plans 
to supply more ammunition to Russian troops to make them mobile. 
  Moreover, both sides decided to create the system of 
air-defense in Armenia in the framework of ensuring collective 
security on the Armenian territory. 
  Grachev and Ter-Petrosyan also discussed the implementation 
of a cease fire and the disengagement of troops in the zone of 
the Armenian-Azeri conflict, which was signed earlier this year 
in Moscow. 
  More than 3,000 people have been killed in six years of 
fighting over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabkh, an 
Armenian- populated enclave surrounded by Azeri territory and 
theoretically ruled by Azerbaijan. 
  On Friday, Grachev arrived in the Georgian capital of 
Tbilisi, where he met with Georgian Leader Eduard Shevardnadze. 
They discussed the timing and a mechanism of the deployment of 
Russian peacekeepers in the zone of the Georgia-Abkhazia 
conflict. 
  Afterwards, the Russian minister left for Gudauta to discuss 
the same issue with Abkhazian leaders. 
  According to Grachev, both Georgia and Abkhazia agreed on 
having Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in the conflict 
zone. 
  Three Russian motorized-rifle battalions from two 
peacekeeping divisions in the Leningrad [St. Petersburg] and 
Privolgye Military Districts are ready to arrive at the conflict 
zone and also ready to take part in the disengagement of the 
warring forces and the enforcement of cease fire is a Russian 
paratrooper regiment now stationed in Gudauta. 
  Meanwhile, the commander of the Russian troops in the 
Transcaucasus has been ordered to prepare another three 
battalions for the peacekeeping operation. 
  Thousands of people have died since a war broke out between 
the breakaway Abkhazia and Georgia in August 1992. 
  Grachev arrived in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on 
Saturday. One of the main topics in his talks with Azeri 
President Geydar Aliyev was the Azeri-Russian protocol on a 
cease fire and the disengagement of troops in the Azeri-Armenian 
conflicting zone, which was signed on May 17. 
  Both men also discussed the establishment of a rocket attack 
prevention station in Gabel, a major facility located in the 
north of Azerbaijan. According to Grachev, the Azeri president 
fully agreed that the station was of strategic importance for 
both sides. 
  They also talked about the creation of a single system of 
air- defense in the caucasus, a main topic in Russia's foreign 
policy in the "near abroad." 
  Returning to Moscow on the same day, the Russian minister 
told reporters that Aliyev had positively responded to all these 
issues and ordered his Defense Ministry and experts to look into 
details.

  [Text] Beijing, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin pointed out during his talks with his Estonian counterpart 
Lennart Meri that Sino-Estonian ties have enjoyed smooth 
development. 
  Meri said that a good basis exists for the two countries to 
develop mutually beneficial cooperation. 
  During the talks, Jiang said that Meri's visit was an 
important event in bilateral ties, which would give impetus to 
Sino-Estonian cooperation. 
  Jiang appreciated the positive attitude the Estonian 
Government and Meri are taking toward developing Sino-Estonian 
relations. "The Chinese Government is satisfied with the smooth 
development of the bilateral ties since the two countries 
established diplomatic relations three years ago," Jiang said. 
  Meri expressed his thanks for China's acknowledgement of 
Estonia soon after it regained independence and said that his 
current China visit is of historic importance. 
  "The two countries have differences as well as lots of 
common 
points," he said. "There is a good basis for the two countries 
to develop mutually beneficial cooperation." 
  Although Estonia is a small country, it is important in 
terms 
of geopolitics and the global economy, which would play an 
important role in China's entry into the market of West Europe, 
Meri said. 
  "I hope that entrepreneurs of the two countries will further 
their contacts in order to expand bilateral economic 
cooperation," he added. 
  The Chinese president said that China respected and 
understood Estonia, a country regaining independence, to 
determine its social, economic and foreign policy according to 
its reality. 
  "We always hold that all countries, big or small, rich or 
poor, strong or weak, are all equal members in the international 
community," Jiang said. "We are against seeking hegemony and 
power politics, as well as interference in other countries' 
internal affairs." 
  Non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, Jiang 
said, is the core of a new international political and economic 
order China advocates establishing. 
  He stressed that China's principal task was to handle its 
own 
affairs well and to develop its economy, which was an important 
contribution to the world. 
  Although the two countries have conducted direct trade for 
only a short time, it has had a good start, Jiang said. "The 
delegation of entrepreneurs the president brought to China this 
time will create a good opportunity for people in the industrial 
circles of the two countries to establish contacts with each 
other," he added. 
  China, along with Estonia, would like to develop a new 
economic cooperative field on the basis of equity, mutual 
benefit and joint prosperity, Jiang said. 
  Meri expressed his appreciation for Jiang's view that 
stability is the prerequisite of development, and said that 
every country should have a "brake" built into its economy. 
  He said that China had achieved positive results in its 
economic reforms. 
  The two leaders also exchanged views on regional and 
international issues of common concern. 
  After the talks, they signed a Sino-Estonian joint 
declaration. 
  Before the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony to welcome 
Meri.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, China's 
vice-premier and foreign minister, said here today that he is 
looking forward to his coming visit to Estonia. 
  Qian said this when he met with visiting Estonian President 
Lennart Meri here at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this morning. 
  According to an official of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, 
Qian and Meri discussed bilateral relations as well as the 
international situation during the meeting. 
  Qian said that China and Estonia share common points in many 
ways. 
  Meri said he will be delighted to receive Qian in Estonia, 
adding that it is good for both Estonia and China to further 
enhance bilateral political and economic cooperation. 
  Meri said that great changes have taken place in the world, 
and that the United Nations is playing a more and more important 
role. He said that Estonia holds that small nations in the U.N. 
should have the same right to speak, and hoped China would make 
efforts for this goal. 
  Qian said China has always maintained that all nations, big 
or small, should be equal. Small nations are the majority in 
the U.N., he said, and the functions of the U.N. General 
Assembly should be strengthened and resolutions approved by the 
Assembly should be respected by the international community, in 
which small nations can play roles. 
  Touching on bilateral economic relations, Meri said that 
Estonia enjoys a good investment environment and there is great 
potential for bilateral economic cooperation. 
  The president hoped that China would take positive action 
and 
encourage Chinese enterprises to do business in Estonia. 
  Meri said that China is rich in oil resources and that 
Estonia has strengths in oil shale exploration and utilization, 
hoping that the two countries may conduct cooperation in this 
regard. 
  Qian agreed that entrepreneurs in the oil industry of both 
countries should have contacts to discuss cooperation 
possibilities. 
  He said some small Chinese entrepreneurs are doing business 
with Estonia at present and that the two governments should give 
support to these enterprises. 
  After the meeting, Qian hosted a banquet in honor of Meri 
and 
his party.

  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin met and had a discussion here this evening with a Hong 
Kong delegation on how to maintain the territory's stability and 
prosperity. 
  Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of 
the 
Communist Party of China, told Herbert Liang, president of the

maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity during its 
transitional period and after 1997". 
  Jiang urged Hong Kong people from all walks of life to unite 
and do everything beneficial to its stability and prosperity. 
  He said that the way forward will by no means be very

sovereignty over Hong Kong will be unshakable." 
  "I am full of confidence in Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity", Jiang said. 
  During the meeting, Jiang congratulated the Chinese

"Lu Ping on Need To Set Up Mechanism To Supervise Construction 
Costs, Progress of Hong Kong New Airport"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) of the State 
Council, said here today that the Sino-British Airport Committee 
will continue to hold meetings this month to discuss financial 
arrangements for the new airport, and that after China and 
Britain reach an agreement on financial arrangements for the new 
airport, a supervisory mechanism should be established to pay 
close attention to construction costs and supervise the progress 
of projects. 
  Lu Ping made these remarks when meeting with the delegation 
of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions headed by Chairman 
Li Chak Tim. He said that the differences between China and 
Britain over financial arrangements for the new airport are 
narrowing gradually and that China hopes to solve the problem of 
financial arrangements first, and then discuss the draft 
regulations of the Airport Authority. He reiterated that the 
Chinese side is not demanding that the financial burden on the 
future special administrative region (SAR) after 1997 not exceed 
HK$5 billion, but according to the provisions of the Memorandum 
of Understanding, the two sides must negotiate if it exceeds 
that amount. At present, the Hong Kong government has financial 
reserves of over HK$100 billion and the proceeds from the sale 
of the land along the airport railway will far exceed the 
originally estimated HK$40 billion. Therefore, it is not 
difficult to resolve the financial arrangements for the new 
airport, and I hope the British Hong Kong Government will inject 
more money and reduce as much debt as possible. Lu Ping 
stressed that after the question of financial arrangements is 
resolved, it will be necessary to establish a supervisory 
mechanism, and in keeping with the principle of "low costs and 
high efficiency" -- as expressed in the Memorandum of 
Understanding -- it is necessary to pay close attention to 
construction costs so that costs will not rise continuously. At 
the same time, it is necessary to supervise the progress of 
projects and to strive to complete most of them before 1997. 
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the role of the 
Airport Consultative Committee, and the Airport Consultative 
Committee is also one of the channels. I hope that everyone 
will have a cooperative attitude, and will earnestly and 
properly resolve the new airport issue. 
  On the question of retirement insurance, Lu Ping said: The 
Economic Panel and the Social and Security Panel of the 
Preliminary Work Committee recently held meetings to discuss 
this question. They held that the question of retirement 
insurance for old people has a bearing on social stability and 
should be resolved at an early date so as to guarantee that 
people have something to depend on when they are old and so can 
work with their minds at ease. The committee members held that 
the retirement pension the British Hong Kong Government is 
pursuing is subsidized welfare and that a comprehensive staff 
retirement insurance system should be established first. 
Therefore, they hoped that the British Hong Kong Government 
would propose a comprehensive retirement insurance plan at an 
early date, extensively solicit views from all quarters again, 
and strive to settle the question before 1997. As for what form 
should be adopted, the two panels of the Preliminary Work 
Committee need to study the question further. However, most 
committee members tend to favor setting up a compulsory 
provident fund. 
  As for the question raised by members of the delegation that 
workers find it difficult to find jobs during the transition of 
Hong Kong's economic pattern, Lu Ping said: The Chinese 
Government has always been rather concerned about this, and will 
strictly control some departments and regions in their labor 
services to Hong Kong so as to avoid an impact on the employment 
of the Hong Kong work force. The plan to export mainland 
professionals to Hong Kong is also under the HKMAO's direct 
control. Lu Ping said: The future development of Hong Kong's 
economic structure also should be based in industry because 
industry really can create value. The reason the securities 
markets of Tokyo, New York, and London are booming is that they 
are supported by strong industries. So far, the Chinese side 
has not considered discussing this issue with the British side. 
But out of the long-term consideration for a smooth transition, 
the Chinese side will put this question to the British side. 
  Lu Ping reiterated that the Basic Law already has clear 
stipulations on the question of civil servants' pensions. The 
future SAR's HK$25 billion of financial reserves plus over 
HK$100 billion of land reserve already can meet the needs of 
retirement pensions for civil servants in 1997. The pension for 
civil servants after 1997 is guaranteed both by law and by the 
financial status, so they can rest completely assured. The 
Chinese side supports the setting up of a civil service 
long-term service fund and is preparing to propose to the 
British side, through the Joint Liaison Group, a considerable 
increase in funds on the basis of the HK$7 billion so as to put 
civil servants' minds more at ease. Moreover, the Basic Law 
also has stipulated clearly that except for the 20 or more top 
officials, all members of the civil service may continue in 
their posts as long as they are willing to serve the SAR. It is 
not necessarily true that the top officials cannot remain in 
their posts, but they must be nominated to the executive chief 
and be appointed by the central government. Some members of the 
delegation proposed that the SAR Preparatory Committee issue a 
notice in 1996 stating these views. Lu Ping expressed approval. 
  Speaking on property prices, Lu Ping said: The British Hong 
Kong Government's current measures to curb property prices are 
mainly to increase land supply. It will increase 15 hectares 
this year and will increase another 55 hectares before 1997. 
Moreover, it also has asked the Land Commission to increase an 
additional 50 hectares of land as a reserve. Together, they 
make up 120 hectares. This does not include the annually 
approved land, the 58 hectares of land along the airport 
railway, and the military land to be converted to civilian use. 
In this way, land supply after 1997 will be more than 200 to 
300 hectares. The Chinese side worries that this will lead to a 
slump in property prices. Therefore, this question must be 
negotiated through the Sino-British Land Committee and handled 
carefully. 
  State Council HKMAO Deputy Director Wang Fengchao was 
present 
during the meeting. 
  In addition, asked by reporters today whether he would meet 
with British Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad on his 
visit next month, State Council HKMAO Director Lu Ping said: 
Goodlad is a guest from the Foreign Office and will meet with 
people from the Foreign Ministry. His visit this time is not 
intended for the Hong Kong issue, but to discuss Sino-British 
relations and other international issues. Lu Ping said that he 
would unavoidably have contact with Goodlad.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of the 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, met a 
visiting Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions delegation at the 
Hong Kong and Macao Center in Beijing this evening. Li Zetian 
and Zheng Yaotang are the chief and deputy chief of the 
delegation. 
  Lu Ping welcomed the visitors and expressed the hope that 
the 
federation would unify a broad range of compatriots who love 
their country and Hong Kong, and would continue making 
contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition. 
  On the new Hong Kong airport, he said: The Airport Committee 
will continue discussing the fiscal plan proposed by the Hong 
Kong Government. We hope this issue will be solved at an early 
date. After solving the fiscal arrangements, we certainly will 
continue paying attention to the new Hong Kong airport's cost 
effectiveness and construction speed in accordance with the 
principles of "low cost and high return" prescribed in the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport. This is of 
great concern to the Hong Kong people. To exercise effective 
supervision, we should set up a monitoring mechanism. We hope 
most of the new airport projects will be completed before 1997. 
  The visitors broached the retirement security issue, which 
is 
of great concern to the Hong Kong people. Lu Ping said: The 
social and security affairs panel and the economic affairs panel 
under the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
recently held discussions on this issue. It is the committee 
members' unanimous view that the Hong Kong Government should 
implement a full-scale retirement security system. The form 
which such a system will take is subject to further discussion 
and examination. This is because the issue affects the security 
of Hong Kong employees' livelihoods. We hope the Hong Kong 
Government will draw up a retirement security plan as quickly as 
possible and implement it at an early date. 
  During the meeting, the visitors said: The federation is 
deeply concerned about the direction in which Hong Kong's 
economy is developing, as well as about the issue of labor 
import. In reply, Lu Ping said: "Some people in Hong Kong say 
that Hong Kong's industries should keep developing. I agree 
with this point because industry directly generates value. 
Without a strong industrial base, the long-term development of 
stock markets and tertiary industries will be affected". On the 
issue of labor import, he stressed that the mainland would not 
export a large number of workers to Hong Kong as to affect Hong 
Kong workers' employment and lives. Lu Ping said: These issues 
do affect Hong Kong's smooth transition. I hope to consult with 
the British Hong Kong Government in due course. 
  During the meeting, Lu Ping also answered other questions of 
concern to the visitors. 
  Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, was present during the meeting.

<F P=106> [From the "News at 8:00" program] </F>
  [Text] Beijing is sending signals that Sino-British 
relations over Hong Kong may be thawing. A local delegation 
visiting Beijing has been repeatedly assured by senior Chinese 
leaders and officials that the time has come for cooperation. 
Linda Lee reports. 
  [Lee] The message came from the Chinese vice premier and 
foreign minister today. Qian Qichen was receiving a delegation 
from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions at the Diaoyutai 
State Guest House. The tone of the Chinese vice premier was 
much milder than last year, when Beijing lashed out at Governor 
Chris Patten's political reform proposals. Qian was quoted as 
saying that the failure of the political talks last year is a 
thing of the past; now is the time to cooperate on economic 
issues. The Chinese vice premier also told the delegation that 
there has been good progress in recent defense land talks and 
negotiations on the new airport. 
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Director Lu 
Ping revealed that the Sino-British Airport Committee will meet 
again sometime later this month, but he did not specify any 
dates. Lu hinted the gap between the two sides is narrowing. 
  [Begin Lu recording in Mandarin with English subtitles -- 
processed from the Mandarin] From the angle of financial 
arrangements, we should say there is no difficulty; the British 
Hong Kong Government should inject more funds into it and reduce 
the size of debts. A solution can be found to that issue, and 
there should not be any obstacles. The gap between the two 
sides is narrowing. We are striving to resolve the issue as 
early as possible. 
  [Lee] On the pension scheme for civil servants, Lu told the 
federation that the $7 billion proposed by the Hong Kong 
Government is not sufficient. China will raise the issue at the 
next Joint Liaison Group meeting.

Qichen Stresses Need To Reorganize Hong Kong's Three-Tier 
Councils After 1997"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun--Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen met a delegation from the Hong Kong Federation of 
Trade Unions in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today. During 
the meeting he stressed that because the Sino-British talks on 
the constitutional system had broken up, Hong Kong's three-tier 
councils elected by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council 
will terminate on 30 June 1997, no matter what methods are 
adopted; these three-tier councils will be reorganized after 1 
July 1997. He hoped that the Hong Kong Federation of Trade 
Unions will, under the banner of loving the country and Hong 
Kong, extensively unite people in all circles in Hong Kong and 
make contributions to Hong Kong's steady transition as well as 
its stability and prosperity. 
  Cheng Yiu-tong, deputy chief of the delegation, said after 
the meeting that Qian Qichen stressed that China and Britain are 
big countries and need to improve the current situation. 
Although the talks on the constitutional system have ruptured, 
there are still opportunities for both sides to cooperate in 
other fields, including the economic field. Recent talks on the 
new airport and military sites have made headway and the British 
Government will send personnel to Beijing soon. These indicate 
that there will be an improvement in Sino-British relations. 
That the three-tier councils will be reorganized after 1997 
does not mean there is anything wrong with the members but 
because the electoral system was unilaterally decided by the 
British side, Qian Qichen said. 
  Cheng Yiu-tong quoted Qian Qichen as saying that he agreed 
that attention should be strengthened on the Hong Kong people's 
livelihood, because this is beneficial to maintaining Hong 
Kong's steady transition in the coming three years and the 
continuous development of the mainland's reform and opening up 
serves as a good guarantee for Hong Kong's steady transition. 
  Also present at the meeting was Lu Ping, director of the 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.

  [Text] The Government is confident it can muster sufficient 
support in the Legislative Council (Legco) to pass its electoral 
reform bill at the end of the month. 
  The confidence is due to the growing likelihood that the 
Liberal Party and independent members will have difficulty 
pushing through their package of amendments to water down the 
original government proposals. 
  Last night, a government official said although "a lot may 
happen" before June 29 when the electoral reform legislation 
would be debated in Legco, the government bill would be passed 
by a "reasonable majority". The official would not say how many 
votes the Government had secured but he said it was "confident 
enough" the bill would go through Legco intact. 
  The draft legislation is based on the original electoral 
reform proposals first announced by the Governor, Chris Patten, 
when he arrived in Hong Kong in 1992. The proposals, which 
would extend the electorate in the functional constituencies to 
cover the whole working population and establish an election 
committee made up of directly elected District Board members, 
provoked the wrath of China and started the long running 
Sino-British row. 
  A Liberal Party legislator, Selina Chow, would not say how 
many votes her party had secured for the package of amendments 
as they were still discussing this with some independent 
legislators. 
  Chow said there were still "many variables" affecting 
whether 
legislators would support their package. 
  The amendments --now known as the 1994 package-- proposed by 
the Liberal Party and independent members is designed to reduce 
significantly the electorate in the functional constituencies 
from the original proposals. 
  Its proposal for the election committee also differs from 
the 
Patten package and is modelled on a four-part committee 
--comprising the professions as well as municipal council 
members-- as stipulated in the Basic Law. 
  Some independent members who are vital to the outcome of the 
vote believe the 1994 amendments have only a "slim chance" of 
success. 
  It is believed the deciding factor will be the way 
legislators who are close to Beijing cast their votes. "The 
package would be a dead duck if they abstain", one member said. 
  Another legislator said that unless the Chinese side changed 
its stance and supported the diluted proposals, there was little 
chance they would be passed. China has said whichever package 
is passed on 29 June, it would not be able to straddle 1997. 
  "In that sense the 1992 [Patten] package and the 1994 
package 
have equal status", he said. 
  Yesterday, the secretary for the pro-China Democratic 
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), Cheng Kai-nam, 
said his party still had to decide whether DAB's representative 
in Legco, Tam Yiu- chung, would support the 1994 package. Cheng 
said they still had to wait and see what the Liberal Party's 
final position would be. 
  "They said one thing one day, another thing the next day. 
One time it's even been said that they would support Emily 
Lau's bill to have 60 directly elected seats. 
  "We can't say until we're sure what they're really up to", 
he 
said. Another member said the Government's attitude would be 
the deciding factor in whether the 1994 package would be passed. 
  "We don't know how keen the Government is to push their own 
proposals through; there hasn't been much lobbying so far. 
  "Perhaps the British have their own agenda -- to mend the 
fence with China by letting the watered-down version pass", he 
said. 
  The government official denied the Government has been slack 
in lobbying legislators. He said the Government was lobbying 
legislators of "all shades of political opinion" to endorse its 
proposals. 
  "Both the Governor and senior government officials have been 
arguing intensely both in public and in private that the 
government proposals are the best for Hong Kong", he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- The special defense 
and public security subcommittee under the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group began formal negotiations on 13 June after four 
days of informal meetings. Concerned parties here said that 
this indicates positive progress in Sino-British talks on the 
handover of Hong Kong military land. 
  Chinese and British representatives for the talks told the 
press yesterday that the two sides have narrowed their 
differences through the informal experts' meetings. They 
expressed hope that this formal meeting would bring forth a more 
positive outcome, and they would strive to reach an early 
agreement. 
  Chen Zuoer, Chinese representative for the special defense 
and public security subcommittee, said: Chinese and British 
experts have worked frantically hard with a positive and 
pragmatic attitude since 8 April. They have coordinated well 
both in and out of the meetings, and made progress in narrowing 
differences between the two sides with a fairly flexible work 
style. He said: Following the consultations, the 16th round 
Sino-British meeting on Hong Kong defense and public security 
has begun. We are looking forward to a more positive outcome 
and an early agreement from this experts' meeting. 
  British representative Alan Paul agreed with Chen Zuoer's 
remarks. He expressed hope that the formal meeting would yield 
positive and early results on this basis and pave the way for 
the liaison group's plenary meeting, to be held next week in 
Hong Kong.

<F P=106> ["Commentary on Hong Kong Affairs" column by Jiang Haizong </F>
(3068 3189 1350): "Stability Is What the Young People Want"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong and mainland youth organizations recently 
conducted sample surveys of Hong Kong, Beijing, and Guangdong 
youths. The results of the surveys indicate that young people 
in these three regions put "social stability" in first place and 
a "perfect legal system" in second place. Young people are the 
most lively factor in society. They regard "social stability" 
as the first condition for their living environment. This fully 
suggests that social stability has become the main trend in the 
current mainland and Hong Kong societies. This general trend is 
what the young people wish to have. 
<H5>  Economic Prosperity Cannot Be Separated From Social Stability </H5>
  A host of facts, ancient and modern, suggest that the 
prosperity and development of a country or region are closely 
related to its social stability. Without social stability, the 
economy will not prosper. Everyone has deep feelings about the 
positive and negative experiences in mainland reform and this is 
the same with Hong Kong's situation. Since the end of the war, 
Hong Kong has relied on its prolonged social stability in 
becoming an international financial, economic, trade, shipping, 
and tourist center, thus forming an effective operational 
mechanism. Social stability is an important factor. 
  Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that stability must 
override everything else. During a recent meeting with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, Jiang Zemin pointed out: 
"Over the last five years, our persistent efforts in 
maintaining stability and taking this as a matter of priority 
importance have resulted in China's economic development, social 
tranquility, and improvement in the people's lives. Facts have 
proved that this practice is absolutely correct." Being a 
country with 1.2 billion people, whether or not China remains 
stable has a global bearing. If an unbridled turmoil occurs, 
the country splits, war breaks out and spreads, and large 
numbers of refugees swarm out of the country seriously affect 
the tranquility of the countries and regions around China. In 
such cases, Hong Kong would be the first to suffer and the 
consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, China's stability 
is not for the sake of China's development alone but also 
benefits the stability and prosperity of Asia and the rest of 
the world. Facts prove that China's stability and development 
over the last 10 years have benefitted not only the Chinese 
people but also world peace and development. 
  The Chinese Government takes into account much of the 
mainland's stability and accounts for Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity. When China and Britain were holding talks on Hong 
Kong's future, the Chinese Government proposed safeguarding and 
preserving Hong Kong's social stability and economic prosperity 
and regarded this as an important objective. It was included in 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration. For this reason, the 
Chinese Government formulated the policy of one country, two 
systems, along with other basic principles, openly committing 
itself to maintain Hong Kong's social and economic system in 
such a way that it will remain unchanged for 50 years. All this 
has been confirmed in the Basic Law in accordance with the 
policy of one country, two systems. In the 10- year 
transitional period since China and Britain signed the Joint 
Declaration, the Chinese side has always abided by this 
principle stand in cooperating with the British side in handling 
all Hong Kong affairs. We believe this is known to all Hong 
Kong people and the international community. Although the 
British side has not kept its promises and has ruined 
Sino-British cooperation over the constitutional system, the 
Chinese side is still willing to cooperate with the British side 
on economic matters and the people's lives and materialize into 
a steady transition. This is the most convincing proof. 
<H5>  Hong Kong's Survival and Prosperity Are Closely Connected </H5>
With the Mainland's Stability 
  In the past, some people described Hong Kong as the goose 
which laid the "golden eggs". Since the mainland introduced 
reform and opening up, Hong Kong has played a role in promoting 
the mainland's economic development. 
  But, as former British Foreign Minister Howe said in the 
British Parliament in December 1984: "In the greater part of 
the previous months, Hong Kong's survival has relied on 
cooperation provided by the Chinese side". This is a fact. The 
Chinese Government has for long kept a positive attitude on 
affairs beneficial to Hong Kong's social stability, the people's 
lives and economic development. Therefore, the Chinese 
Government has always insisted that Hong Kong must not become a 
base for sabotaging or undermining China, nor does it allow the 
mainland to affect Hong Kong's stability. When a turmoil 
occurred on the mainland during the "Great Cultural Revolution", 
Premier Zhou Enlai personally prohibited the Red Guards from 
entering Hong Kong. The mainland has always provided close 
cooperation and support in curbing all crimes, stopping 
smugglers, reducing the effects of stock crashes, delivering 
consumer goods and nonstaple food, and resolving water shortages. 
  Frequent economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong 
Kong constitutes a huge momentum for Hong Kong's sustained 
prosperity and the mainland's stable development since the 
introduction of reform and opening up serves as an important 
guarantee for Hong Kong's sustained prosperity. It is exactly 
because of this that economic prosperity has prevailed on the 
mainland and in Hong Kong at a time when economic depression is 
sweeping the entire Western world. Obviously, whether or not 
the mainland remains stable has become an important factor 
affecting Hong Kong's economy, social stability, and its 
people's lives. The mainland's stability promoting Hong Kong's 
prosperity has become the Hong Kong people's common 
understanding. 
  The preservation of the mainland's stability and Hong 
Kong's prosperity and stability correspond with each other. We 
believe all people without prejudice understand that: Without 
stability on the mainland, Hong Kong could not have achieved its 
current prosperity and stability; any obstacle to the mainland's 
stability could be as bad as ruining Hong Kong's prosperity and 
stability. 
  The mainland's stability include the following two aspects: 
"One is stability in the political situation and the other is 
stability in policies". Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Apart from 
maintaining the stability of the reform and opening up policy, 
there must not be any change in adhering to the four cardinal 
principles, in adhering to the socialist system, and in adhering 
to the Communist Party leadership; these two "no changes" 
constitute the main factors for the mainland's stability. The 
mainland's socialist system is the main component of the policy 
of one country, two systems; only with the existence of this 
main component can other components exist. Without the skin, 
where can the hair grow? "Just imagine, if the socialist system 
changes in China, if the socialist system with Chinese 
characteristics under the leadership of the CPC changes, what 
will become of Hong Kong? Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
could fall through." (Deng Xiaoping's remarks) 
  Coincidentally, some foreign politicians hold similar views 
to Deng Xiaoping. Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew 
has always thought that Hong Kong's role lies in its economic 
value and objects to Hong Kong's confrontation with the 
mainland. Hong Kong is small and the mainland is powerful; in 
politics, it absolutely cannot confront the mainland, he said 
adding, "Should the CPC crumble, China would crumble; then there 
could be 30 to 40 years of chaos in China". During a recent 
visit to Hong Kong, Howe openly said, "Hong Kong must not be 
turned into a bridgehead for changing China. To attempt this 
would be extremely unwise. Hong Kong cannot change China and 
must not think it can change China; any attempt could only 
result in Hong Kong's devastation." During a debate in the 
British House of Lords not long ago, two former Hong Kong 
governors also mentioned issues concerning Hong Kong. MacLehose 
said, "The prospects of Hong Kong and China's economies thriving 
serve as the pillar supporting people's confidence. They are 
actually going smoothly. I hope political factors will not 
become interference in sight of this prosperity". David Wilson 
pointed out, "At this moment, it is quite important to prevent a 
human-made split in Hong Kong society because, whatever it may 
be, it will finally involve the entire interests of Hong Kong 
and Hong Kong people". They both sincerely advised Hong Kong 
people not to confront the mainland or change the mainland's 
system because they had looked wisely at the facts and fully 
understood that any perverse move could have serious 
consequences. 
  As a matter of fact, many Hong Kong people fully understand 
this principle and that it will not do to change the mainland's 
system. Several days ago, an editorial by Hong Kong's 
CHING CHI JIH PAO [Economic Times] pointed out: "Hong 
Kong should not and cannot become a bridgehead for changing the 
mainland's system because it is not equipped with the necessary 
conditions; this is beyond its ability, so to speak. Second, 
this attempt could distort the policy of one country, two 
systems, and Hong Kong would suffer a lot. Third, this would 
deviate from Hong Kong's political reality and go against 
popular will. In terms of its geographical location and 
economic background, Hong Kong is closely related to changes in 
China's situation; how the situation in China changes will 
affect Hong Kong, but Hong Kong can only affect China 
economically and is absolutely not in a position to change 
China's politics". The editorial made these comments out of 
profound knowledge about China's and Hong Kong's situations. 
  In preserving the mainland's stability, there is a need to 
respect its socialist system and affairs. This is the meaning 
of adhering to the policy of "one country, two systems". The 
mainland's and Hong Kong's stability must be treasured, with 
mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs but by 
maintaining good-neighborly relations, promoting each other, and 
making common development. Sabotage activities against the 
mainland must be opposed, the mainland's stability must be 
preserved, dialogue and cooperation with the mainland must be 
strengthened, mutual promotion must be upheld, and common 
development must be encouraged. This is Hong Kong's best choice 
for the present and future. 
<H5>  The British Side Has Caused Unrest in Hong Kong Society </H5>
  The purpose of the Chinese Government in formulating the 
policy of "one country, two systems" in signing the Joint 
Declaration, and in carrying out cooperation with the British 
side is to ensure Hong Kong's steady transition and its 
prolonged stability and prosperity. But the signing of the 
Joint Declaration does not mean that we can relax our efforts in 
maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Deng Xiaoping 
pointed out in 1982 that some people would create confusion 
during Hong Kong's transitional period and "these include not 
only foreigners but also Chinese, but mainly Englishmen". Later 
developments, particularly developments in the latter half of 
the transitional period, have proved that what Deng Xiaoping 
said was unfortunately, correct. 
  In the first half of the transitional period, there was 
cooperation between China and Britain. In the latter half, the 
British side has not strengthened cooperation with the Chinese 
side, as required by the Joint Declaration; instead, it has 
substituted confrontation for cooperation, completely reneged on 
the Joint Declaration, in a brazen attempt to fish for what it 
could not get at the negotiating table and at the expense of 
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. 
  On the 
constitutional system, the British side has acted against the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law's convergence 
principle, and the understandings and agreements reached between 
the two countries; it has intentionally undermined the talks on 
the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements, and unilaterally 
proceeded with what it wishes to do, thus dismantling the rail 
of the "through train" for a steady constitutional transition. 
On the legal system, the British side has speeded up the 
amendments of regulations and legislation and constantly put 
obstacles in the way of implementing the Basic Law; it has 
dished out a "Bill of Rights", which even Britain itself does 
not have, to make the Basic Law impracticable; it has 
disregarded judicial convergence, violated both sides' 
agreements, repeatedly delayed the establishment of the court of 
final appeal, and amended the New Territories Land Exemption 
Bill under the pretext of fake "gender equality", all aimed at 
casting aside the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration. 
  Recently it advocated the establishment of a so-called 
"human 
rights commission" in an attempt to form an adjudication 
institution which overrides the independent judicial system and 
destroys the future special administrative region's [SAR] 
independent judiciary. In the economic field, it has refused to 
carry out the overall financial arrangements which conform with 
the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport's 
construction, real estate prices are soaring, and no one cares 
about coordinating transportation between Hong Kong and 
Shenzhen. All these are related to the British side's efforts 
in accumulating wealth by unfair means, in leaving a financial 
burden for the SAR, and in leaving unstable factors in Hong 
Kong's economy. On the question of government functionaries, 
the British side has refused to cooperate with the Chinese side 
and does not allow Hong Kong Government functionaries to contact 
the Preparatory Working Committee; in addition, it has 
ceaselessly talked about its readiness to consult with the 
Chinese side on the transition of Hong Kong senior public 
servants and its willingness to expedite the arrangements for 
the formation of public servants, in an attempt to deprive the 
future SAR chief executive and the central authorities of their 
powers. 
  The British side has spared no expense in undermining Hong 
Kong's social stability and steady transition because, as a 
British Parliamentary report acknowledged, Britain has changed 
its policy toward China and Hong Kong. The basis of this change 
is, obviously, its wish for the downfall of the Chinese 
Government before 1997 and for Chinese local regimes' separation 
from the central government. In the final analysis, it wishes 
for disintegration and an unchangeable difficult situation in 
China. By then, China will be too busy to consider Hong Kong 
affairs and Britain will continue its administration of Hong 
Kong. At the very least, it wants its colonial influence to 
continue for a long time so that it can protect its colonialist 
interests. It is now the 1990's but these people's minds still 
remain in the previous century. So, it is correct to say that 
it is easy to change mountains and rivers but hard to change a 
person's character. 
<H5>  Those Who Undermine Social Stability Must Not Be Tolerated </H5>
  Apart from provoking trouble, causing confusion, and 
undermining stability under the pretext of "democracy", 
"freedom","equality" and "human rights" the British Hong Kong 
Government has also encouraged some political forces to 
constantly make trouble. Leaders of some organizations in Hong 
Kong are trying to overthrow the Chinese Government and change 
the mainland's socialist system. They constitute a force 
undermining Hong Kong's stability. They have excluded 
themselves from the Chinese people and are following foreign 
anti-China forces, advocating sanctions against China, and 
obstructing China's progress and development. They are opposed 
to anything favorable to China and are creating farces under the 
pretext of freedom of speech. If anything happens on the 
mainland, they take advantage of this opportunity to lead the 
citizens astray, instigate their sentiments against the 
mainland, and sow dissension between Hong Kong and the mainland. 
  As time goes by, the mainland has become increasingly stable 
and developed and the relations between Hong Kong and the 
mainland have become more extensive and close. Their attempt to 
undermine the mainland's stability and ruin Hong Kong's 
prosperity is clearly seen through by more and more Hong Kong 
people, their practice has enjoyed less popular support, and 
they have landed themselves in isolation from others. The Hong 
Kong people have gradually come to understand that if these 
people succeed in their attempt, not only will the mainland's 
stability and development be ruined, Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity will also be destroyed. What these people have done 
does not enjoy popular support at all. They are trying by every 
possible means to carry out one activity today and another 
activity tomorrow but their efforts will come to naught. 
  To preserve Hong Kong's stability, the harmonious relations 
between Hong Kong and the mainland and the mainland's stability, 
Hong Kong citizens have reason to ask the British Hong Kong 
Government to strictly fulfill its commitment to "not allow Hong 
Kong to be turned into a base for hostile activities". If Hong 
Kong's stability and the harmonious relations between Hong Kong 
and the mainland are ruined because of the British Hong Kong 
Government's tolerance and support for the abovementioned 
activities, the British Hong Kong Government must be held 
responsible for the consequences in history. Social stability 
is what the people wish. All people who love the country and 
Hong Kong and hope for the smooth implementation of the policy 
of "one country, two systems" should favor the mainland's 
stability and development and take preserving Hong Kong's 
stability and prosperity as their glorious duty. As long as all 
the descendants of Emperor Huangdi including the mainland and 
Hong Kong people strive for the invigoration of the Chinese 
nation while preserving the different social systems, the day is 
not far off when China will stand in the ranks of the strong 
nations of the world with its people working and living in peace 
and contentment and becoming healthier and better off.

<F P=106>   [Editorial: "Preserve Hong Kong's Value to China"] </F>
  [Text] The 10th anniversary of the official signing of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration falls on 19 December this year. 
For nearly 10 years since the signing of the Joint Declaration, 
China, Hong Kong, and the world have undergone enormous and 
profound changes. Reviewing the Joint Declaration and the 
background to and process of its signing at this important 
moment will help people obtain a more profound understanding of 
the great significance of preserving Hong Kong's value to China 
under the great principle of "one country, two systems." 
  What changes have happened in China, Hong Kong, and the 
world 
over the past 10 years or so? On the world scale, the biggest 
change is that the Cold War has ended, peace and development 
have become the theme of the times, and international relations 
have switched to a track dominated by economics. As far as 
mainland China is concerned, reform and opening up have further 
unfolded on an overall scale since the mid-1980's. Although it 
experienced the 1989 disturbances [feng bo 7364 3134] and the 
dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the 
international arena, China's great undertaking of reform and 
opening up has managed to continue to develop and flourish amid 
acid tests and has become an irreversible historical trend. 
China has become the engine of Asia's economic development. As 
far as Hong Kong is concerned, it entered a transitional period 
upon the signing of the Joint Declaration. The Chinese 
Government's basic principles and policies toward Hong Kong laid 
down in Annex 1 of the Joint Declaration material.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Resumption of Cooperation Calls for </F>
Abandonment of Confrontation"] 
  [Text] The upcoming visit to China of the British Foreign 
Office Minister Alastair Goodlad was first disclosed by the 
British Foreign Office and then confirmed by the Chinese 
department concerned. 
  Although he is not coming to discuss the issue of Hong Kong, 
he should be coming to improve Sino-British relations and resume 
friendship and cooperation. Otherwise, the visit will be 
meaningless. 
  Some newspapers in Hong Kong have expressed a welcome for 
Goodlad's upcoming visit to China and have held that this is a 
sign of improvement in Sino-British relations. 
  In the past few years, Britain has erroneously estimated the 
situation in China and has changed its policy toward China, thus 
harming the friendship and cooperation between China and 
Britain. China has not developed in the direction of the 
illusions cherished by Britain but instead, has become more 
open, more prosperous, and stronger. Practice has proved that 
the British Government's confrontation with China goes against 
the global tide, does harm to its own interests, and does not 
have the support of the people. China is a vast market with an 
extremely large potential and is a country that holds the 
balance of the world. Whoever ignores her or even has trouble 
with her will come to grief. Not long ago, the Clinton 
administration was uncompromising in insisting on linking human 
rights with trade and claimed that it would not extend China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status if China did not "improve 
its human rights" situation according to their instructions. 
The Clinton administration had no alternative but to succumb to 
the reality of China's extraordinary development and finally 
extended China's MFN status without any conditions attached, 
expressing its willingness to strengthen trade and economic 
cooperation with China. At present, some economically large 
countries in the world are trying to have closer ties and 
cooperation with China. Can the British people think of why 
their government wants to have confrontation with China instead 
of taking an approach in the interests of the people? Recently, 
the Conservative Party of the British Prime Minister John Major 
suffered a total defeat in the parliamentary elections, losing 
all five seats; this was followed by bitter defeat in the 
European Council elections in which nearly half of the original 
32 seats were lost mainly to the opposition, the Labor Party. 
This has evidently shown the voters' dissatisfaction with the 
British Government and John Major's position is in danger. 
Under such circumstances, the Major administration has no 
alternative but to look for some way out. Trying to improve 
relations with China and to resume cooperation is one of the way 
out. 
  The key to improving Sino-British relations is that Britain 
must abandon its erroneous policy of confrontation with China. 
A report issued recently by the Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee of the British Parliament discloses the situation of 
changes in the policy toward China by the British Government in 
recent years and also counsels the British Government about 
continuing its confrontation with China, thus adding fuel to the 
fire. If the British Government really wants to resume 
Sino-British cooperation, it must make an open statement on its 
stance toward that report. 
  People will judge whether or not Britain has the sincerity 
to 
improve its relations with China by its actions. Although 
Alastair Goodlad's visit to China is not for discussing the Hong 
Kong issue, he cannot avoid touching upon the Hong Kong issue 
and his visit cannot have any impact on how to handle the issue 
of Hong Kong. What Chris Patten practices in Hong Kong will be 
an important expression of the change in the British 
Government's policy toward China. If Alastair Goodlad really 
comes to improve relations and to resume cooperation, he should 
urge the British side to create an atmosphere of cooperation on 
the issue of Hong Kong and to negotiate and solve together with 
the Chinese side, some pressing problems such as those 
concerning the new airport, the military use of land, and so on. 
  Regarding the political structure, it is impossible to have 
Sino- British cooperation because the basis for such cooperation 
has been completely destroyed by the British side. Qian Qichen, 
State Council Vice premier and concurrently Foreign Minister, 
reaffirmed yesterday: "It does not matter whatever plan the 
1994 and 1995 elections are carried out, the terms of office of 
those elected will only last till 30 June 1997 and after that, 
the councils concerned will be reorganized". However, China and 
Britain can cooperate in issues other than the issue of 
political structure, such as economic and social issues and 
issues concerning the people's livelihood. The Chinese side has 
always been sincere in such cooperation. So long as the 
proposals conform with the principle of state sovereignty and 
smooth transition and are in the interests of the economic and 
social development of Hong Kong and of the peaceful and 
contented lives and work of the residents, the Chinese side will 
adopt a positive attitude to negotiate with the British side and 
to solve all the problems in a fair and reasonable manner. Vice 
Premier Qian Qichen said that the breaking down of talks on the 
elections in 1994 and 1995 was something of the past and at 
present, the two sides should seek opportunities for cooperation 
on other issues. 
  Regarding solutions to problems of the new airport and land 
for military use, Qian Qichen, State Council Vice Premier and 
concurrently Foreign Minister, Lu Ping, director of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Chen Zuoer, representative of 
the Chinese side on the Defense and Social Order Subcommittee, 
have in the past few days adopted optimistic attitudes. They 
all believe that progress has been made in the talks and hope 
that agreements can be reached earlier rather than later. This 
shows that the Chinese side sincerely hopes to cooperate with 
the British side. 
  It seems the British side has been put to the test. If the 
British side shows a cooperative attitude at meetings of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and is willing to listen to 
fair and reasonable views from the Chinese side, the two sides 
will be able to reach agreements on the new airport and land for 
military use and this will show Alastair Goodlad's sincerity to 
improve relations and resume cooperation in his visit to China. 
  In short, since Alastair Goodlad wants to seek cooperation 
in 
Beijing, he should create a favorable atmosphere for cooperation 
before he starts his trip. This should be shown not only in 
words but also in deeds. Talking about Alastair Goodlad's visit 
to China, British Ambassador to China Robin McClaren said that 
the British side hoped to resume better relations but denied 
that the British side hoped to readjust the policy for 
Sino-British relations during the visit. We can only ask: Can 
China and Britain resume "better relations" if the policy toward 
China is not readjusted? What is the meaning of the remarks by 
the ambassador?

<F P=106> [First installment in a series of articles by Huang Wenfang, </F>
a former official with XINHUA News Agency's Hong Kong Branch who 
retired from XINHUA in 1992 and now lives in Hong Kong] 
  [Text] I officially joined the Hong Kong branch of the New 
China News Agency (Xinhua) on January 5, 1950. Even though by 
the second half of 1949 I was already acting as "underground 
messenger" for the director of Xinhua, I was still not 
officially within the organization. 
  At the time, my principal task was youth work, where I was 
one of the leaders of the renowned leftist youth group, the 
After-school Social Club. The date of the official 
establishment of Xinhua was May 1, 1947, which means 1997 will 
be its 50th anniversary. 
  While I was one of the earliest cadres at Xinhua, I do not 
deserve to be called one of the founders of the branch. 
  The only founder still alive is the former head of the 
Foreign' Affairs Department, Tan Gan. 
  Xinhua was the first public organization of the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) that was set up abroad. 
  During the anti-Japanese war there was an Eighth Route Army 
administrative office in Hong Kong headed by Liao Chengzhi. 
  But this organisation still used a business name. Xinhua was 
the first to use the name of the Communist Party. 
  The decision to set up the branch was made by the (former 
premier) Zhou Eniai, the then secretary of the party's South 
China Bureau. 
  After the war, Zhou led the party's negotiating team from 
Chongqing to Nanjing for talks with the Kuomintang. 
  He decided to set up the branch in November 1946, just 
before 
leaving Nanjing to return to Yanan. 
  When he left Nanjing, Zhou was already thinking that a 
significant portion of the undercover work in "white areas" 
(controlled by the KMT) in the struggle between the CCP and the 
KMT after the war would be shifted to Hong Kong. 
  Hong Kong would become an important rear base for work in 
the 
KMT-controlled areas. 
  A significant portion of the core leaders would also be 
shifted to Hong Kong. 
  To meet with changes in work at the time, it was necessary 
to 
set up a public organization. After Zhou returned to Yanan, a 
significant portion of the work of the South China Bureau would 
be handed to the South China sub-bureau. Its headquarters would 
be set up in Hong Kong, headed by Fang Fang. 
  When Zhou left Nanjing he was already thinking that the 
majority of democratic figures, as well as a considerable number 
of specialist personnel within the party, should remain outside 
of Yanan and other areas of conflict in order to preserve their 
power. 
  He was also considering how to organize manpower and prepare 
skilled personnel for the upcoming struggle for political power. 
  A significant majority of specialists within the party -- in 
particular those involved in international and cultural affairs, 
were sent to Hong Kong. 
  A great portion of the outstanding figures of the democratic 
parties were also in Hong Kong at the time. 
  Zhou Enlai decided that, apart from leaders of the Communist 
Party committee in Shanghai, most of the other party members in 
Shanghai, including Qiao Guanhua, Zhang Hanfu, and Pan Hannian, 
would move to Hong Kong. 
  Qiao Guanhua would be the first director of Xinhua. 
  At the time of its establishment, there were 15 staffs split 
into three groups. 
  The first was the five members of the Hong Kong 
administrative office of the East River Column (a party 
organization in eastern Guangdong). 
  The second group of five was in charge of the underground 
radio station run by the South China Bureau. 
  The third was the five in the editorial office of the former 
CHENG PAO (a party paper in Hong Kong which folded after the 
party's Shanghai newspaper moved to the territory). 
  At the time, there were two party organizations in Hong Kong 
-- the party and the city work committees. Responsibilities 
were divided between the two. 
  The party committee handled above-ground work such as 
propaganda, united-front activities and policy research, while 
the city committee handled work among the masses. 
  Party committee members were half-open about their 
identities, but city committee members were very secretive. 
  Qiao Guanhua's official title was director of Xinhua, but 
his 
unofficial title was secretary of the party committee. 
  After obtaining a doctorate in Germany, Qiao worked in Hong 
Kong during the war against Japan and then went to Chongqing to 
act as Zhou Enlai's political secretary. 
  After liberation (1949), he remained in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and eventually became minister. 
  Even though for a time when it was part of the underground 
party committee, Xinhua, it is most accurate to say, has always 
been a top-level post of the Chinese Communist Party. 
  No matter what time or under what circumstances this has 
always been its identity and the most accurate description of 
its character and position. 
  A "top-level post of the party" can be summed up briefly. 
  First, it is one set up and controlled by the party. 
  Second, it represents and holds responsibility for the 
party's work which falls within the scope of Hong Kong. 
  Third, "top-level" means it is the party's top organization 
in the Hong Kong region. 
  This is not to say Xinhua's internal identity has never 
changed. 
  When Qiao Guanhua founded the branch, Xinhua was essentially 
the same as the party committee and he was the committee 
secretary. 
  After liberation, there was a period of time when things 
were 
quite chaotic. 
  The party committee was dissolved and its work transferred 
to 
the South China subbureau in Guangzhou, whose secretary was Ye 
Jianying, the second secretary Zhang Yunyi and the third 
secretary Fang Fang. 
  The official title of Xinhua's second director, Huang 
Zuomei, 
was the representative of the South China subbureau in Hong Kong. 
  In the beginning, Zhang Tiesheng had no public rank or 
title. 
  Only when the Hong Kong government began issuing personal 
identity cards in 1950 did he take an official title -- 
editor-in-chief of Xinhua. 
  I accompanied Huang and Zhang to collect their identity 
cards. 
  Many people say that the editor-in-chief of Xinhua at the 
time was Li Chong, which is not correct. 
  I think the only two people who know this now are Tan Gan 
and 
myself. 
  After Zhang Tiesheng was transferred, Huang Zuomei was 
promoted to special representative. 
  In 1952-53 the party committee for Hong Kong was 
reestablished in Guangzhou under the leadership of the South 
China sub-bureau and called the Hong Kong and Macau work 
committee of the CCP. 
  Its first secretary was Qu Mengjue, then the party secretary 
of Guangdong province, and the second secretary was Wang Kuang. 
  Many people do not understand why Liao Chengzhi sent Wang 
Kuang to take over as the director of Xinhua after the cultural 
revolution. 
  They believe Wang only handled propaganda work. 
  In fact, he had been handling Hong Kong work since the early 
1950s. 
  When Mao Zedong came in on an inspection tour of Guangdong 
province in 1956 and checked on the Hong Kong work, he made 
critical remarks to the effect that it had always been done in 
Hong Kong and there was no reason to move it to Guangzhou. 
  He ordered the Hong Kong and Macao work committee 
transferred 
back to Hong Kong and sent Liang Weilin as third director of 
Xinhua. 
  Liang had been one of the leaders of the East River Column. 
  After it withdrew from the north, he was a politburo member 
of central Guangdong, becoming the party secretary in 1949. 
Before coming to Hong Kong he was the director of the Guangdong 
education bureau. He had worked for many years in Hong Kong. 
  His public title was director of Xinhua, but his real 
position was secretary of the Hong Kong and Macao work committee 
of the CCP. The deputy secretary was Qi Feng. 
  Only in 1990 was Hong Kong and Macao work separated. In the 
past, Macao work came under Hong Kong's leadership. The Macao 
branch of the New China News Agency was known internally as the 
Macao sub-committee and was under the leadership of Xinhua. Its 
secretary was a member of the Hong Kong and Macao work committee. 
  As the time approached for the return of sovereignty of 
Macao 
and its work took on unique features, the work was split into 
two new committees, the Hong Kong work committee and the Macao 
work committee of the CCP.
