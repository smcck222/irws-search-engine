<F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>
  [Text] At least 17 people are now known to have been 
killed by the collapse of Zhuhai's Yu Xin factory on Friday and 
scores remain missing. Rescue workers were today planning to 
continue their search for more victims still believed to be 
trapped in the rubble. 
  The tragedy happened the day after fire tore through the 
six- 
storey printing and dyeing factory and while workers were on the 
premises, reportedly trying to clear up and salvage goods. 
Reports yesterday said the authorities had arrested three 
welders they claim had started the blaze by igniting bales of 
cotton in the factory, a joint Hong Kong and Chinese venture. 
No one was hurt in that incident. 
  The factory site, five kilometres north of Macao, was 
cordoned off by police, and reporters were barred from Zhuhai 
People's Hospital where an emergency team awaited victims. 
There were unconfirmed reports that one Hong Kong worker was 
taken to hospital and three others had died in the tragedy. 
Last night, 57 of the injured had left hospital and 101 were 
still being treated. 
  All buildings in the region are being checked by officials 
today for safety and fire security measures. Some workers 
suggested a combination of thunderstorms and the fire had 
prompted the collapse of the damaged building and that many more 
bodies were still buried in the rubble. The factory employed 
over 2,000 workers. 
  Labour activists in Hong Kong met in emergency session 
yesterday and denounced greedy local investors who put profit 
ahead of human life. A coalition of trade union and human 
rights groups vowed to fight for strict worker safety 
regulations, and planned to enlist the support of international 
labour groups. 
  Rescue teams and firemen were reported to be among those 
missing in the disaster, which occurred minutes after workers 
were ordered back into the factory to salvage equipment in the 
aftermath of Thursday's blaze. The area was not cordoned off by 
government officials, according to local reports. "How come 
these workers were allowed back in?" asked Lam Wah-hui, chairman 
of the Joint Organisation of Unions in Hong Kong. "This is 
crazy. The authorities should be guarding the site to prevent 
this kind of disaster. If the area is unsafe, no one should be 
allowed inside." 
  Representatives of eight worker, human rights and women's 
groups met yesterday in the territory to form a coalition to 
improve Chinese worker safety, said Winnie Tam, executive 
secretary of the Confederation of Trade Unions. "We plan to 
push investors to pay more attention to worker safety," she 
said. "Most of these incidents involve Hong Kong investors. We 
plan to advocate strong measures for the protection of workers 
in China. They shouldn't be victims of Hong Kong investors." 
  The Zhuhai accident is the second this month involving Hong 
Kong businessmen. A toy and plastics factory in Shenzhen 
collapsed two weeks ago, killing 11 migrant workers. Last 
November 84 people, mostly migrant women workers, died in a fire 
at another Hong Kong- owned toy factory in Shenzhen.

  [Text] Workers at the factory that collapsed in Zhuhai on 
Friday killing 17 people say they were threatened with pay cuts 
if they refused to go back into the gutted building to search 
for undamaged cloth. About 200 workers were inside searching 
for material when the Hong Kong-Chinese joint venture factory 
collapsed. Ten people are still missing and people at the scene 
said five supervisors from Hong Kong were among those still 
buried under the rubble. 
  The injured Yu Xin Printing and Dyeing factory workers, who 
asked not to be named, said they had been told to check the 
six-storey building for unburnt cloth 10 hours after flames left 
it a burnt-out hulk. "About 300 workers were lined up outside 
the burnt building at around 1 pm," one woman said. "Our 
manager told us to collect any unburnt material, otherwise our 
salaries would be deducted." A number of workers ignored the 
management's order. "Some of the workers and I were picking up 
some of the unburnt cloth on the second floor," the woman said. 
"An hour later the building suddenly collapsed and I was 
buried." 
  The woman, who was admitted to the Zhuhai Municipal 
Government Hospital suffering from minor head and leg injuries, 
said she was lucky to escape alive. "Nobody came to rescue me. 
I climbed out from the debris by myself. I don't know how many 
of my colleagues have been buried," she said. 
  According to Shenzhen Municipal Authority spokesman Yang 
Shuiping, 17 bodies had been recovered by last night and the 
search for other victims was to continue today. She said the 
workers had heard nothing from the Hong Kong owners about 
compensation for their injuries although management had sent two 
people to visit the victims several times telling them to "take 
care". 
  Other workers at the hospital said a Hong Kong factory 
manager gave the order to enter the building to salvage cloth 
and begin a site clean-up. The woman said: "Even the factory 
fire did not kill anybody. But his order did." 
  The spokesman, a Mr Yang, [as received] said of the 158 
people hospitalised, 101 were still receiving treatment while 
another 15 were in a serious condition. 
  Yesterday piles of debris from the collapsed factory reached 
the third floor of an adjoining building. Smoke still poured 
from the rubble despite heavy rain and the fire being 
extinguished more than 24 hours beforehand. Witnesses said half 
the building was like "carbon" and believed heavy rain 
contributed to its collapse. 
  It was the second time in as many weeks that an industrial 
building in China's most dynamic region collapsed. A 
partially-built Shenzhen factory collapsed earlier this month 
killing 11 people. The Governor of Guangdong province, Zhu 
Senlin, visited the disaster scene yesterday. 
  Mr Yang said the government had vowed to find those 
responsible for the disaster. He said three welders had been 
arrested. The workmen allegedly caused the fire when sparks 
from equipment they were using to install fire safety measures 
ignited cotton bales. The fire broke out on Thursday in the 
factory's number three workshop. No one was injured in the 
blaze which was put out by Friday morning. 
  The Yu Xin factory, located inside Zhuhai's Qianshan Textile 
City, is a joint venture between a Hong Kong merchant and the 
Zhuhai Qian-shan Industrial Co.

  [Text] Extensive flooding has touched the hearts of the 
autonomous regional party and government leaders. In the last 
two days, regional CPC Secretary Zhao Fulin, who was attending 
the National Education Conference in Beijing, inquired about the 
losses caused by floods and issued concrete instructions on 
flood fighting and relief work every day. Yesterday, after 
regional Deputy Secretary Ding Tingmo reported to Secretary Zhao 
on the losses inflicted by floods, Comrade Zhao Fulin instantly 
and explicitly pointed out: 1) All prefectures, counties, 
cities, and townships hit by floods must take flood fighting and 
relief tasks as the focus of their work, and must try by every 
possible means to minimize the losses caused by floods. 2) Good 
arrangements should be made for flood victims. Local 
governments must work hard and mobilize the masses of people so 
that villages and neighbors help each other. Leading cadres at 
all levels must go down to the flooded areas and do a good job 
in relief work. To put it briefly, they must try their best to 
fight floods, secure safety, and reap bumper harvests. 
  Regional government Chairman Cheng Kejie issued a special 
instruction to the heavily flooded city of Liuzhou. He said: 
It is necessary to do a good job in moving flood victims to 
secure places, while at the same time, maintaining social order 
and guaranteeing the safety of the people's lives and property. 
Leaders of all institutions and units must be on duty, and 
cadres must go to the forefront to do relief work. 
  The regional party committee and government held an 
emergency 
meeting this afternoon to mobilize forces to fight floods and do 
relief work. Liu Mingfu, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee and chairman of the regional people's congress, 
stressed: Party committees and governments at all levels in the 
region must grasp flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus 
of their current work. All departments must go down to the 
flooded areas and help them solve practical problems. At the 
same time, they must carry out more telephone contacts, 
establish a system of taking a turn on duty so as to guarantee a 
smooth of information, stop all meetings currently under way, 
and concentrate their energy on doing a good job in flood 
fighting and relief work.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here today 
that economic cooperation between China and India far exceeds 
competition. 
  She made the remark at the luncheon hosted by the 
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in her honor when 
answering a question from an Indian journalist. 
  China is trying to build a socialist market economy and 
India's economy is a market one, she said, adding that the 
nature of the market economy is competition. 
  The Chinese minister said that cooperation and competitions 
are inter-dependent and there exists a certain competition 
between the two countries in the international market. 
  "But that is a friendly competition and the cooperation 
between China and India exceeds competition actually," she said. 
  In her speech, Wu Yi elaborated the Chinese Government 
policies on foreign investment and joint ventures and answered 
questions from Indian businessmen present at the luncheon. 
  Today, the Chinese minister also met Indian Minister of 
State 
for Coal A.K. Panja and Indian Minister of State for Petroleum 
and Natural Gas S. Sharma. 
  Both sides discussed matters relating to the further 
development of cooperation between the two countries in the 
areas of coal, steel as well as petroleum and natural gas. 
  Wu Yi will be leaving here this evening for the next and 
last 
leg of her four-Asian-nation visit, Singapore.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 17 (XINHUA) -- An Indian 
businessmen team organized by the Confederation of Indian 
Industries (CII) is leaving tomorrow for China to look for 
business and cooperation opportunities. 
  This was announced by CII President Subodh Bhargava today at 
the luncheon hosted by CII in honour of visiting Chinese 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Trade Wu Yi. 
  The CII mission will visit several places in China during 
the 
period from June 20 to June 24, Bhargava said. 
  "The main objective of the mission is to look at the 
possibilities of developing trade, business and investment 
cooperation between the two countries," the CII president said. 
  He expressed the hope that the CII will send another team to 
China later in the year and to meet the industrialists in the 
interior provinces of China. 
  Bhargava said that he was very happy at the considerable 
improvement of bilateral trade between India and China last year. 
  "With economic and trade liberalization in India and China 
opening its market to the world and also to each other, CII will 
play an effective and catalytic role enabling members of Indian 
and Chinese industry to take the advantages of the open-door 
policy of the two governments," he said. 
  The CII president noted that Chinese overseas trade is of 
the 
order of nearly 200 billion U.S. dollars per year while the 
India- China trade stood at less than 700 million U.S. dollars 
last year. 
  "Both have a developing economy and therefore the potential 
for mutual beneficial business can well understood by any 
businessmen," he said.

<F P=106> [By Chen Ming: "Iraq Postpones Visit by Iranian Delegation"] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Iraq, the former foe of 
Iran during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, has postponed the 
visit by an Iranian delegation to Baghdad for two weeks or maybe 
longer, a high-ranking Iranian official disclosed here today. 
  "As our delegation is leaving for Baghdad, the Iraqi side 
sent a telex message, asking for a 2-week postponement of the 
visit," Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister 'Abbas Maleki told XINHUA: 
  Therefore, the Iranian delegation has been still in the 
country and the planned trip by foreign minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati has also been postponed, he added. 
  Nevertheless, he did not give any detail about the cause of 
the postponement by the Iraqi side, adding that he was still 
optimistic over the relations between Iran and Iraq. 
  However, observers here noted that the postponement would 
cast a shadow on the improving relations of the two former foes. 
It also indicated that the two sides have had big differences 
on some major issues. 
  They also doubted the prospect of the bilateral relations 
because many problems still remain unsolved, such as the fate of 
prisoners of the eight-year war between the two countries, war 
compensation, Iraqi aircraft in Iran and support of each side's 
opposition forces. 
  The future talks will no doubt be focused on removing the 
obstacles of the improving relations, rather than rapid 
normalization of ties, which cannot be foreseen in the immediate 
future. 
  The two sides will have a lot of important issues to 
discuss, 
including the trade. Once the UN sanctions against Iraq lifted, 
Iran can be a major supplier of goods to Iraq. 
  However, Iranian dailies acknowledged that Tehran's mistrust 
and lack of faith in the Baghdad regime is not without reason. 
Baghdad has been supporting the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq 
Organization (MKO) to launch cross border attacks from inside 
Iraq. 
  The Iranian delegation was formerly scheduled for Iraq on 
June 11 to make preparation for Velayati's visit to Iraq. 
  According to official report, Velayati was preparing the 
trip 
to Iraq to discuss bilateral ties and other issues, including 
the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from both countries. 
  If the Iranian foreign minister makes the trip, it would be 
the first visit by Velayati to Iraq since the 1991 Persian Gulf 
war, when U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. 
  The POW issue is the main obstacle for an improvement of 
ties 
between the two countries. 
  According to an official report, Iraq is still holding 8,000 
Iranian military personnel and civilians, including soldiers 
captured almost 20 years ago in border skirmishes. 
  But Iraq has denied holding any Iranian citizens and claims 
20,000 of its own troops are being held in Iran.

  [Text] Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC and

On 18 June, he came to the Zhuhai People's Hospital to visit 
and extend regards to workers who were injured when the former 
Zhuhai Shanyuxin textile factory collapsed after catching fire, 
kindly telling them to concentrate on receiving treatment; the 
workers were greatly moved. After staying in the wards on the

car. According to an injured worker in a ward, President Jiang 
asked each patient the following questions: Where are you 
injured? Where do you live? Do you have any relatives in 
Zhuhai? He hoped they would concentrate on receiving medical 
treatment and wished they would recover soon. The injured 
workers were very glad at the visit by a state leader. 
  In the afternoon of the same day, Qian Qichen, vice premier 
and foreign minister, came to the site where the textile factory 
had collapsed so as to gain an understanding of the situation. 
He expressed appreciation for the Zhuhai Government's efforts 
to rescue the victims. 
  It has been proved that 24 people died as a result of the 
accident. The relatives of the dead have begun to identify the 
remains. Over 50 percent of the accident site has been cleaned 
up.

<F P=106> [Report: "Jiang Zemin Visits Shenzhen, Discusses Problems </F>
Regarding Macroeconomic Regulation and Control"] 
  [Text] Just at the time of the second anniversary of Deng 
Xiaoping's work inspection in south China, CPC General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin arrived in Shenzhen on the morning of 19 June to 
conduct investigation and study there, following visits to other 
Guangdong cities, including Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and so 
on. 
  It has been learned that Jiang Zemin was accompanied by 
leading Guangdong cadres, including Secretary Xie Fei, Governor 
Zhu Senlin, and others, during his visit to many places in the 
province. 
  As disclosed by a relevant authoritative source, the Fourth 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee will be held in the 
second half of this year, at which decisions will be made on 
such issues as the macroeconomic regulation and control of the 
socialist market economy and the transformation of large- and 
medium-sized state enterprises. In order to study the practice 
of macroeconomic regulation and control under market economy 
conditions and to gather firsthand information, many members of 
the Politburo of the Central Committee Standing Committee 
recently have conducted investigation and study one after 
another in various localities throughout the country. It is 
believed that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's current visit to 
various places in Guangdong, including Shenzhen, is precisely 
for the observation and study of these issues. 
  It also was disclosed that Jiang Zemin will stay in Shenzhen 
for approximately two or three days. Apart from paying some 
visits, he primarily will listen to reports by Shenzhen party 
and government leaders on the city's conditions concerning the 
in-depth reform, the national economic development and changes, 
and so on over the past two years or so.

  [Text] Nanning, June 19 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central 
Committee, telephoned Zhao Fulin, secretary of the CPC committee 
of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Saturday [18 June] 
evening to express his solicitude for the people in the flooded 
area of the region. 
  Jiang asked about the flood situation, the local people's 
efforts to fight the disaster, and the central and local 
governments' relief efforts. He expressed his sympathy and 
solicitude for the people of various nationalities in Guangxi 
and for the cadres, common people, and officers and men of the 
People's Liberation Army, armed police force and public security 
force who are combating the flood. 
  After hearing Zhao's report, Jiang noted that the Xijiang 
River in Guangxi is still at a flood peak and the water level 
remains high. "Even when the flood peak passes," he said, 
"efforts should be made to help the local people to tide over 
the disaster. Party committees and governments at all levels in 
the region should concentrate during the current period on the 
work of combating the flood and delivering disaster relief." 
  He said the party, government and people should spare no 
efforts in the fight against the floods and in safeguarding the 
people's lives and property. Leaders at all levels should go to 
the frontline of the battle against the flood, keep abreast of 
the flood situation, organize the masses to overcome 
difficulties and reduce losses and make adequate arrangements 
for their livelihood. 
  Leaders of the Guangxi regional party committee and 
government have held a meeting to discuss how to carry out 
General Secretary Jiang's instructions to mobilize all the 
forces of the party, government and people to overcome the 
disaster.

  [Text] Beijing, June 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng today called at the office of the State Flood Control and 
Drought Relief Headquarters to inquire about the flood situation 
in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the provinces of 
Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi in southern China. 
  Premier Li showed great concern about the flood situation in 
the valleys of the Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang 
rivers. He expressed sympathy and solicitude for the broad 
masses of local people and the soldiers of the People's 
Liberation Army, armed police force and security force who are 
in the forefront of combating the flood. 
  The Chinese premier also expressed the hope that the people 
and soldiers in the flood-hit area would, under the leadership 
of the local party committees and governments, carry forward the 
spirit of continuous fighting to safeguard the dykes of the 
rivers and the cities such as Guangzhou, Changsha and Nanchang, 
and finally overcome the flood disaster. 
  Since severe rainstorms hit southern China in early June 
this 
year serious floods on the four above-mentioned rivers have hit 
Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi. The local people, led by 
the party and government, are combating the floods to reduce the 
losses to the minimum.

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng presided over a meeting here today to draw up detailed 
plans for flood relief and prevention work in some southern 
Chinese provinces and autonomous regions. 
  Other Chinese Communist Party and government officials, 
including vice-premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing, took part in 
the meeting. 
  Instructions from Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the 
current flood control and relief work were passed on at the 
meeting. 
  Participants also listened to reports about the present 
anti- 
flood and relief work from departments such as the State Flood 
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the Ministry of Water 
Resources, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Planning 
Commission, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, 
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Meteorological Station. 
  In April and May, serious floods occurred in east China's 
Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, and in central China's Hunan 
Province. Entering June, the most serious floods were reported 
to have occurred on the Xijiang River of southwest China's 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Beijiang River in south 
China's Guangdong Province and Xiangjiang River in Hunan 
Province. A large number of areas have been affected. 
  Premier Li said the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee 
and the State Council were paying close attention to the flood 
situations in these areas. 
  Party and government departments of all levels in the 
affected areas are all mobilizing the cadres and ordinary 
citizens, the Chinese [People's] Liberation Army men and the 
armed policemen to help prevent and control floods, as well as 
to provide relief in disaster-hit areas. 
  To make a success of flood control and disaster relief work, 
the meeting has also decided to send special working groups, 
formed by Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, Wen jiabao, member of the 
secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, 
and State Councillor Chen Junsheng, to join local officials, 
army men and local people in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and 
Jiangxi in flood control and disaster relief work. 
  The Chinese premier stressed that the priority of current 
flood control work should be to guarantee the safety of the 
grand embankment along the Beijiang River and embankment 
projects in Zhujiang (Pearl) River delta, to rescue residents 
besieged by floods as quickly as possible, and to ensure that 
people in flood-hit areas have enough to eat and wear and to 
prevent epidemics breaking out. 
  The premier also urged local officials to help people to 
resume production as soon as possible and rebuild their 
communities. 
  The flood control work of this year has just begun and the 
main flood season starts in late July and early August, while 
serious droughts were also reported to have hit some other 
areas, said the premier, urging that different localities must 
be well prepared for major floods and the most serious droughts.

and Guangxi. The groups will be composed of officials from the 
Ministries of Water Resources, Construction and Civil Affairs, 
and the State Economic and Trade Commission, as well as from the

<F P=106> [Apparent text of speech by Jiang Zemin to the national </F>
education conference in Beijing on 14 June] 
  [Text] Comrades: This national education conference is an 
important meeting held by the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council amid the new situation in which China has 
quickened its pace of building a socialist market economic 
system and of modernization. The primary task of the conference 
is, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, to carry out the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, to further carry out the strategy of 
giving priority to educational development, and to mobilize the 
whole party and country to earnestly implement the "Outline of 
China's Educational Reform and Development," in order to 
accomplish the task of China's educational reform and 
development in the 1990's. On behalf of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, Comrade Li Peng will deliver an 
important report at the conference; I hope that all departments 
and localities will earnestly study the report and act 
accordingly. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, under the leaderships of party committees and 
governments at all levels and with the diligent work of mass 
education workers, the country's education has developed 
rapidly, educational reform has been carried out step by step, 
noticeable results have been achieved in educational work, 
people's educational levels have been raised, and a large number 
of specialized personnel have been cultivated. All of this has 
made great contributions to the country's economic construction, 
science and technological progress, and social development. On 
behalf of the party Central Committee and State Council, I would 
like to extend my high respects to the masses of teachers and 
other education workers who have worked diligently on the 
education front. I would also like to extend my heartfelt 
thanks to people of all social sectors who have shown concern 
for and given support to educational work. 
  The party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have 
always attached importance to educational work -- in the overall 
development strategy for building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, they have always regarded educational work as a 
fundamental issue that affects the overall socialist 
modernization efforts and the historical fate of socialism. 
Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the important position 
and role of education in the socialist modernization drive, and 
he has maintained that the first step in the "three-step" 
development strategy is to develop education, science, and 
technology. He pointed out: Science and technology are the key 
to achieving modernization, and education is the foundation of 
modernization. We should respect knowledge and specialized 
personnel. Leaders at all levels should ensure good educational 
work as they ensure good economic work. We should not engage in 
empty talk and should do more practical things. However poor we 
are, we should ensure the availability of sufficient funds for 
science and educational development. We should do everything we 
can to solve educational problems -- even if this means we have 
to bear with difficulties in other areas or even slow down the 
speed of development a little. However difficult the situation 
may be, we have to raise remuneration for teachers and truly 
help them solve their specific problems. Comrade Xiaoping also 
has given many important instructions on educational reform and 
development: Education should be modernized and be geared toward 
the world and the future. We should thoroughly and correctly 
carry out the party's principle guidelines on educational 
development, adhere to the right course, and truly do a good job 
in educational reform, in order to bring about the great 
development of and a major improvement in educational work. We 
should closely attend to ideological and political education 
among young people and students and cultivate socialist people 
of the younger generation who have lofty aspirations, a sound 
moral sense, and good education and discipline. Comrade 
Xiaoping's discussions on education are the theoretical basis 
for the party's principal guidelines and policy on education in 
the new period. They set the course and serve as a powerful 
ideological weapon for educational reform and development. In 
studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, comrades of the whole party, 
especially leading cadres at all levels, should truly comprehend 
Comrade Xiaoping's educational thinking and, like Comrade 
Xiaoping, should attach importance to education from a strategic 
perspective, in order to contribute to educational reform and 
development. 
  Comrades, what are the means and ways to realize the grand 
objective of socialist modernization construction for China, a 
country with nearly a 1.2 billion people, with inadequate 
resources, and with a relatively undeveloped economy and 
culture? There are ways which are of decisive significance. 
They are: shift economic construction onto the track of relying 
on scientific and technological advances; raise the quality of 
the working people; genuinely elevate education to a strategic 
position and give priority to the development of education; and 
strive to raise the people's moral, scientific, and cultural 
levels. These are the major and fundamental ways to realize 
China's modernization. The following message was solemnly 
delivered at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee to all party members: whether China can establish a 
socialist market economic system and realize its modernization 
will be decided finally by whether it can raise the quality of 
its people and by whether it can train a large number of 
talented people. 
  Since the implementation of the policy of reform and opening 
up, the entire party and society have renewed and raised their 
understanding of the importance of education and of the need to 
elevate education to a strategic position. Also, there has been 
a sharp rise in the number of regions, departments, and units 
which have done an excellent job of carrying out educational 
reforms and of developing education since China implemented the 
policy of reform and opening up. Despite these remarkable 
results, education lacks balanced development. Some regions and 
departments have yet to raise education to the strategic level. 
Some comrades do understand the policy of making economic 
construction the central task, but they do not have an adequate 
understanding of the need to shift the strategic policy onto the 
track of relying on scientific and technological advances to 
develop the economy and to raise the quality of the working 
people. Some comrades made such remarks as: "We must develop 
the economy, but education can take a backseat"; "develop the 
economy first, and education later." There are even cases of 
diverting educational funds for economic projects and for the 
construction of office buildings, luxury hotels, meeting halls, 
and guesthouses, as well as the phenomenon of delays in paying 
teachers' salaries. Some comrades have not exerted enough 
effort to carry out the policy of promoting the reform and 
opening drive with one hand and promoting the building of a 
socialist spiritual civilization with the other and have 
slackened their efforts to carry out ideological and political 
education among youth. Such an understanding of education, and 
also those practices run contrary to the demands made by the CPC 
Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping. They not only lack 
being farsighted but also are harmful. 
  All levels of leading comrades should understand completely 
that the energetic development of education, accelerating the 
pace of training talented people for socialist modernization 
construction, and raising the ideological, moral, scientific, 
and cultural quality of all the people in the nation are the 
inevitable demands for implementing the party's basic line and 
for unwaveringly adhering to the party's basic line for 100 
years. Only by developing education will we be able to 
fundamentally enhance China's overall strength and be able to 
seize the strategic initiative in the fierce international 
competition. Only by training generation after generation of 
the builders and successors with ideals, morality, culture, 
discipline, and devotion to the socialist cause with Chinese 
characteristics can we guarantee the long reign and stability of 
the state. In the entire course of socialist modernization 
construction, we must always persist in elevating education to 
the strategic position and in giving priority to develop 
education; we must never waver on this point. If we do not have 
a correct understanding of the issue of education, we will lose 
our opportunity, adversely affect our great plan, and make a 
historic mistake. 
  To accelerate educational reform and development, it is 
necessary to comprehensively realize the "Development Outline 
for China's Educational Reform" promulgated by the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council. This is an important matter 
both for educational departments and for the entire party and 
society. All levels of party committees and governments should 
enhance their leadership over education work in a down-to-earth 
manner, should formulate a concrete enforcement plan by taking 
localities' actual conditions into consideration, and should 
carry out careful planning and arrangements for implementation. 
Major responsible comrades should frequently visit schools and 
grass-roots units to carry out investigations, to provide 
guidance, and to handle in a timely manner major and pressing 
issues. When formulating a development plan and an annual plan, 
all levels of party committees and governments must make sure 
that they give priority to developing education. The CPC 
Central Committee has set out the demand that areas and 
departments which have failed to implement well the guidelines 
on elevating education to the strategic level are required to 
further increase their understanding of the importance of 
education, to readjust their construction layout and investment 
structure, and to ensure that priority be given to developing 
education. Attaching importance to training talented people, 
ensuring adequate funds for education, and doing concrete things 
for education must be incorporated into the target 
responsibility system for leading party and government cadres 
and be made the important criterion for evaluating their 
performance. Job-performance evaluation departments must take 
the above conditions into account when evaluating cadres. All 
leading cadres who have a high sense of responsibility toward 
the party and the people should work hard for the reform and 
development of education in their localities. As for schools' 
leadership structure, party committees at institutions of higher 
learning which practice the school presidents responsibility 
system under the leadership of party committees should discuss 
and make decisions on major issues and ensure that 
administrative leaders fully exercise their own rights and 
functions. Party organizations should also fully bring into 
play their political roles in other schools as well in secondary 
and primary schools which experiment with or practice the school 
principals responsibility system. 
  Implementing the guidelines on elevating education to the 
strategic level and on giving priority to develop education 
requires the entire party and society to help foster and 
maintain a good social mood for respecting teachers. The hope 
for revitalizing the nation rests with education, and the hope 
for invigorating education rests with teachers. Teachers are 
what we call the engineers of the human soul. Their profession 
is noble and yet arduous. They deserve respect from the whole 
party and all of society. All levels of leading cadres, senior 
leading cadres in particular, should take the lead in respecting 
teachers and education. It is necessary to conscientiously 
implement the "Teachers Law," to help maintain teachers' 
legitimate rights and interests, to raise their salaries and 
improve their welfare in line with the relevant provisions, and 
to create the necessary conditions for their work, for their 
study, and for their daily life. Every year, many party 
committees and governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities do several concrete things for teachers. This is 
a good practice that needs to be greatly promoted. All 
departments and all social sectors are called upon to show 
concern for and to support education with great enthusiasm, to 
respect teachers' hard work, and to carry forward the Chinese 
people's excellent tradition of respecting teachers and 
education. 
  Various categories of schools at different levels should 
thoroughly implement the party's education principle, uphold the 
socialist orientation in running schools, and make efforts to 
train new people with "lofty ideals, moral integrity, good 
education, and a sense of discipline" along with the development 
of morality, intellectuality, and physics. Schools should 
respond to the new situation and the new problems that have 
emerged in the course of reform and construction by constantly 
strengthening and improving their ideological and political work 
as well as their political education. It is necessary to 
strengthen education on such things as the basic theory of 
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought -- particularly Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the party's basic line, patriotism, 
collectivism, socialism, China's modern and contemporary 
history, state conditions, and fine cultural and revolution 
traditions. Various categories of schools at different levels 
should sum up experience and improve their teaching skills to 
ensure teaching results in political lessons. The purpose of 
strengthening theoretical and ideological education and 
political work is to guide and help youths and students to 
foster a correct world outlook, outlook on life, and concept of 
values; to build a scientific theoretical foundation; and to 
identify the political orientation of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. It is only through these means that we 
will be able to enhance youngsters' ability to resist the 
corrosive influence of such decadent types of thinking as wrong 
ideological trends, money worship, hedonism, and 
ultra-individualism. Principal leading cadres of various 
localities and departments should make it a rule to hold regular 
situation discussion meetings with teachers and students. To 
promote stability and unity, it is necessary to conscientiously 
maintain teaching order in schools. All of society should help 
create a fine educational environment by showing concern for and 
offering protection for the healthy growth of our students. 
  At this juncture, I would like to particularly touch on the 
question of integrating education with productive labor. This 
phrase, which has been explicitly included in the "outlines," is 
an important component of our education principle. The 
integration of education with productive labor is a basic 
measure to uphold the socialist orientation in running schools. 
We have been implementing this clause all along since the 
founding of the nation. This has been a correct direction with 
overall success -- despite the emergence of some problems in its 
implementation -- and it has been conducive to the healthy 
growth of youths and students. Facts have proved that confining 
students to classroom studies without taking part in labor, 
without contact with social practice, without knowledge of how 
workers and peasants laboriously create social wealth, and 
without fostering passion for the working people will not be 
beneficial to their healthy growth and all-around development. 
Students' appropriate participation in certain types of 
material production labor should be made mandatory and not 
optional. We should fully understand this point and attach 
importance to it. To implement the principle of integrating 
education with productive labor, we should do well the following 
tasks: 1) Schools should include this subject in their teaching 
programs in consideration of their own realities and through 
overall planning; 2) education departments at various levels 
should offer concrete guidance and carry out supervision and 
inspections; 3) party committees and governments at various 
levels should strengthen their leadership in this respect; and 
4) all parties concerned should positively offer their support 
and cooperation to help provide the necessary conditions for 
students' participation in productive labor. 
  One of China's basic national conditions is developing 
education on a large scale while the economy is relatively 
backward. We must bear this fact in mind and deepen educational 
reform to ensure that the educational structure and system meet 
the requirements of development in the socialist market economy 
and in all social sectors. No matter how difficult our 
financial situation is, we must be willing to invest in 
education to ensure that compulsory education develops well -- 
this is a foundation-laying project for improving all the 
people's educational level. We should carry out reform to 
further improve the quality and efficiency of higher education; 
we should forcefully develop vocational and adult education at 
various levels to enable the majority of our people to raise 
their ideological and cultural level and to improve their 
vocational skills. The key way to readjust the educational 
structure is to establish more vocational schools of various 
kinds to train large numbers of junior- and medium-level 
specialized personnel in all fields. This not only will help 
students pursue studies in different fields but will also meet 
the current needs of economic and social development. The mass 
of education workers of education departments and schools at all 
levels should further emancipate their minds, do things in light 
of reality, strive to develop a new educational system, seek a 
new educational development path under the conditions of a 
socialist market economy, and endeavor to build a socialist 
educational system with Chinese characteristics. 
  Comrades, achieving the grand goals of China's educational 
reform and development for the 1990's is a very honorable yet 
arduous task. With the efforts over the 40 years and more since 
the founding of the People's Republic, especially with the 
development over the 15 years since the country adopted the 
policy of reform and opening up, our education has developed 
considerably, we have accumulated many valuable experiences in 
carrying out educational reform, and the country now has more 
than 10 million teachers. All these things have laid a good 
foundation for future educational reform and development. The 
central authorities believe that under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, China's education 
definitely will develop day by day as long as we unswervingly 
attach strategic importance to education and give priority to 
educational development, and as long as we seize the opportunity 
to implement the "Outline of China's Educational Reform and 
Development" in a down-to-earth manner.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The national work 
conference on the inspection of the two basic tasks opened 
today. Participants in the meeting are expected to make 
arrangements for implementing the guidelines set out at the 
national education work conference and for further strengthening 
the education inspection work. 
  The two basic tasks are basically popularizing nine-year 
compulsory education and basically eliminating illiteracy among 
the younger generation and people in the prime of their lives by 
the end of this century. 
  Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and State Council vice premier, met with 58 state 
education inspectors prior to the meeting. He said that the 
national education work conference had set out the tasks of 
accelerating the pace of education reform and development, had 
decided on the major goals of various types of education, and 
had clearly set out the tasks of basically popularizing 
nine-year compulsory education and of basically eliminating 
illiteracy among the youth and middle-aged people by the end of 
this century. The basic popularization of the nine-year 
compulsory education and the basic elimination of illiteracy are 
fundamentally in accord with the demands for raising the overall 
quality of the Chinese people and are the most important tasks 
for developing China's education for a certain period in the 
future. The key to meeting the demands is to forcefully 
implement the guidelines set out at the national education work 
conference. The current education inspection work conference is 
the first of such practical moves to implement the guidelines 
set out at the national education work conference. He pointed 
out that education inspection work is the forceful guarantee to 
realize the goals of the "two basic tasks." Therefore, all 
levels of party committees and governments must attach great 
importance to and enhance this work. Realizing the goals of the 
"two basic tasks" is the responsibility of the government. All 
levels of governments should strive to fulfill this task during 
their terms. Work on fulfilling the two basic tasks should be 
made the chief criterion for evaluating administrative and 
personal performance. Li Lanqing expressed the hope that all 
levels of education inspectors would work hard, give full play 
to the role of education inspectors, and contribute to the 
revitalization of China's education. 
  China has set up a complete education inspection system and 
has established the State Education Commission Inspection Group 
and provincial, prefectural (city), and county-level education 
inspection organs since the restoration of the education 
inspection system in 1986. The inspectors supervise the 
enforcement of the Education Law. They carry out supervision 
and inspections, and they provide evaluations of and guidance to 
subordinate governments' education work, education 
administrative departments, and schools' work. The scope of the 
education inspection work at the present stage mainly involves 
the inspection of secondary school education and below, as well 
as the supervision of other relevant work. They mainly 
concentrate their work on compulsory equation and on the 
elimination of illiteracy.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
today stressed that the only way to solve the educational 
problems in China is to continue with reforms. 
  Li made his remarks at the closing session of a national 
education conference. 
  On behalf of the Communist Party Central Committee and the 
State Council, Li called on the whole party and the people to 
contribute to the flourishing of China's educational sector. 
  He said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important 
speech 
and Premier Li Peng's keynote report to the conference contain 
the major strategy, policies and measures for the development of 
China's education, which show the party Central Committee and 
the State Council's determination to fight for and expectations 
for the progress of education. 
  China, with a large population and as an economically 
underdeveloped country, conducts the world's largest-scale 
education program, the vice-premier said. Its investment in 
education cannot meet actual demands. "That will be a long-term 
contradiction," he said. 
  Li said that China must start from its actual conditions and 
explore suitable ways to develop its education in a more 
effective way. 
  The conference reaffirmed the objective that by the end of 
this century, China should realize universal nine-year 
compulsory education and elimination of illiteracy among the 
young and middle-aged. 
  The vice-premier noted that the objective agrees with 
China's 
reality and he is confident at realizing the goal. 
  He said that the work set by the objective constitutes the 
basis for improvement of the quality of the Chinese nation and 
one of the foundations of socialist modernization. 
  He said that economic development in the 1990s will lay a 
better foundation for the development of education. 
  At present, there are about 36 million illiterates among the 
young and middle-aged population in China. In recent years, 
about five million of illiterates have annually shaken off 
illiteracy. 
  Li said that at this rate, it is possible that the 
illiterate 
population will disappear by the end of this century. 
  He noted that difficulties in popularizing nine-year 
compulsory education lie in the rural areas, especially 
poverty-stricken regions. 
  He called for efforts to cultivate qualified teachers and 
run 
normal schools well. 
  He stressed special aid for the education of ethnic minority 
people. 
  Li also said that China must promote vocational and adult 
education so as to provide opportunities for most young people 
to receive technical and professional training and to improve 
their cultural and professional capabilities. 
  On the reform of the system of higher education, Li said 
that 
the universities administered by ministries and central 
departments should expand their services and increase majors. 
  He called on adopting diversified forms in the management of 
universities, rational readjustment of the structure of the 
universities and raising of economic and social results. 
  He also talked about ethnic education, increases in 
education 
funds and improvement of teachers' treatment. 
  Today's conference was presided over by Ding Guangen, member 
of the party's Politburo.

XINHUA reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] 
  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The national education 
conference closed in Beijing this afternoon. Delivering a 
summation speech at the conference on behalf of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, Li Lanqing, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of 
the State Council, called on the whole party and all sectors of 
society to act energetically to implement the guidelines of the 
conference and to strive to make contributions to help China's 
education system flourish. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and Secretariat, presided over the closing ceremony. 
Attending the conference were leading comrades, including Wei 
Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Ismail Amat. 
Responsible comrades from the central committees of the various 
democratic parties and leaders of the All-China Federation of 
Industry and Commerce were invited to attend the conference. 
  In his speech, Li Lanqing said: In convening this high-level 
conference, the party Central Committee and the State Council 
aimed to mobilize the whole party and all sectors of society, 
beginning with high-ranking leaders of the party and government, 
to earnestly implement the "Outline" [Outline Program for the 
Reform and Development of Education in China], push forward the 
reform and development of education in China, and enable 
education to make greater contributions to China's socialist 
modernization drive. Delegates attending the conference said 
unanimously that Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and 
Comrade Li Peng's keynote report showed great foresight and 
contained both strategic principles and pragmatic and specific 
policies and measures, all of which demonstrated the 
determination of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council to attach importance to the development of education, 
and also demonstrated their ardent expectation that all sectors 
of society would attach importance to the development of 
education. 
  Li Lanqing stressed: The fundamental way to solve 
educational problems in China is reform. Of course, we must 
also make conscientious efforts to tackle the practical 
difficulties and problems facing education. China is a 
developing country with nearly 1.2 billion people and a 
relatively backward economy, but it is running education at a 
scale that surpasses that of every country in the world. With 
limited financial strength, China will not be able to put 
sufficient funding into education to meet practical needs. This 
will remain a contradiction for a long time to come. We must 
proceed from reality, improve educational efficiency in China 
through reform of education, and find a new path for the 
development of education that suits China's national conditions. 
He pointed out: Making nine-year compulsory education 
universal and eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged 
people in China by the end of this century constitute the 
foundation for raising the quality of the whole nation and the 
cornerstone for China's socialist modernization drive. The 
whole party and every sector of society must take the 
realization of these "two basic goals" as an urgent and 
magnificent historical mission. To ensure the realization of 
the "two basic goals," they must vigorously create conditions 
and overcome difficulties. The "two basic goals" set by the 
conference are: To make, by the end of this century, nine-year 
compulsory education standard in about 85 percent of the 
populated areas, with school attendance rates in middle schools 
reaching 85 percent; and make the literacy rate among young and 
middle-aged people 95 percent. This is in accord with China's 
national conditions, and we are confident of fulfilling the 
objectives. We have made elementary education universal in 91 
percent of the populated areas, with attendance by school-age 
students in elementary schools reaching 98.3 percent, and that 
of students in junior middle schools 73 percent. The 
development of the economy in the 1990's will provide a better 
material basis for educational development. Because China is a 
huge country with a vast territory, and conditions in each area 
differ considerably, we have formulated a principle according to 
which programs will be drawn up in line with the characteristics 
of each region, guidance will be offered in line with specific 
conditions, and implementation of programs will be carried out 
step by step. In line with the actual conditions in each 
region, we have set the goal and a deadline for making education 
universal, and put forward methods and modes of running schools 
as well as corresponding measures for educational reform. We 
will not insist on uniformity, and this will help enhance the 
initiative of different regions in fulfilling the "two basic 
goals." At present, three are 36 million illiterates among 
China's young and middle-aged people. In the past few years, 
the number of illiterates has been reduced by about 5 million 
each year. At this rate, it is possible essentially to 
eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people by the 
end of this century if governments at all levels and all sectors 
of society work conscientiously toward this goal. 
  Li Lanqing said: The difficulty in making nine-year 
compulsory education universal lies in the countryside, 
especially in poor areas. In developing education in the 
countryside, we must resolutely change the guiding principle of 
running schools divorced from rural economic construction, which 
exists in varying degrees, and find a way of running schools 
suited to local conditions. In developing rural education, we 
must increase investment and improve the conditions for running 
schools. At the same time, we should vigorously encourage 
overall planning for elementary, middle school, and high school 
education and the integration of agriculture with science and 
education. In either nine-year education or six-year education, 
students should learn to read and write well and cultivate fine 
moral integrity and civilized habits. On this basis, some 
vocational skills and knowledge of applied science should be 
taught. 
  Li Lanqing said: In achieving the "two basic goals," 
efforts should also be made, first, to go all out to cultivate 
qualified teachers and run normal schools well; second, to 
continue to run enterprise-affiliated middle and primary schools 
and kindergartens well while changing the operating mechanisms 
of enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system; 
third, to give special aid to the education of ethnic minority 
people; fourth, to pay close attention to various kinds of 
special education and nursery and preschool education and attach 
importance to problems related to girls' school attendance; and 
fifth, to combine the drive to wipe out illiteracy with programs 
on studying general knowledge and technical skills and 
disseminating socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Discussing vocational and adult education, he said: 
Vigorously promoting vocational and adult education is the only 
effective way to train large numbers of skilled people, which 
conforms with China's national conditions; it is also the only 
way to modernize education and revitalize the economy. In China 
today, those who are able to attend colleges and universities 
are, after all, the minority. The overwhelming majority of 
young people, after undergoing basic education up to a certain 
age, can acquire skills only through vocational education. We 
must vigorously promote vocational and adult education so as to 
provide opportunities for them to receive technical and 
professional training and to enable them to become qualified 
workers with suitable skills needed by society. He said: Adult 
education is a new form of education which develops the 
traditional school education to a life-long learning process; 
and it is of great importance to raising the quality of the 
nation and directly and effectively promoting economic and 
social development. We should go all out to run various adult 
educational institutions well so as to update the knowledge of 
people who are employed and to continually raise their 
ideological and cultural qualities and professional capabilities. 
  Discussing reform of the higher educational system, he said: 
Schools of higher learning are the primary bases for training 
high-level talented personnel and developing science and 
technology, and the development of science and technology is the 
fundamental guarantee for realizing China's second- and 
third-step strategic goals of development and for meeting the 
challenges in the 21st century. To accomplish this glorious and 
yet arduous task, China's schools of higher learning must 
further improve the quality of education and efficiency of 
school management through reforms. He discussed, in particular, 
views on reforming schools administered by departments. He 
said: The system of running schools of higher learning by 
departments took shape when the structure of a planned economy 
was in effect; and it played an important and positive role in 
developing higher education in the past. However, such a system 
of administering schools of higher learning, characterized by 
barriers between different departments, was one of the major 
causes for the "small but comprehensive" system, redundant 
establishment of schools and majors, and poor efficiency. Along 
with the gradual deepening of the economic structural reform, 
such maladies have become increasing obvious, causing more and 
more serious problems for schools of higher learning. 
Therefore, it is imperative to carry out reform systematically 
in line with the goal set forth in the "Outline." At present, 
there are some 300 schools of higher learning administered by 
ministries and central departments. Through the joint efforts of 
various sectors in the past more than a year, dozens of them 
have shifted or are trying to shift to joint management with 
local communities, while many of them are preparing for reform. 
In the future, schools of higher learning administered by 
ministries and central departments should focus reforms on 
expanding their services and increasing majors. They should 
gear themselves to the needs of society, run schools 
independently, encourage management of schools in various forms, 
rationalize the distribution of schools, and raise the 
efficiency of school management. Except for special trades and 
professions in need of continued management of a few backbone 
schools, the majority of schools should gradually shift from the 
system of management at the central and provincial levels to the 
system at the provincial level so as to allow provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions to map out overall 
arrangements and rationally distribute schools of higher 
learning within their jurisdiction, thereby reducing the 
unnecessary redundant establishment of schools and majors and 
concentrating manpower and material resources on improving the 
quality and standards of a number of schools of higher learning. 
All relevant central departments should continue to strengthen 
support and leadership over their affiliated schools of higher 
learning. The purpose of reform is to improve the quality and 
efficiency of these schools and alleviate their difficulties in 
running schools. He pointed out: The task is difficult and 
needs all-out cooperation and support from all sectors. In 
carrying out the reform, it is necessary to proceed from the 
realities, adopt a positive approach, and take prudent measures. 
The majority of ministry-affiliated schools may begin various 
kinds of joint management with local communities and then later 
delegate managerial autonomy to them after conditions are ripe. 
Where conditions permit, managerial autonomy can be delegated 
to local communities immediately. In a nutshell, it is 
necessary to stress actual benefits, and guard against formalism 
and rushing headlong to delegate managerial autonomy. 
  As for intensifying and improving schools' moral 
education, Li Lanqing pointed out: While intensifying education 
on patriotism, socialism, and collectivism, we should also 
compile Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics into teaching materials for 
educating young people. We should attach importance to education 
about China's moral traditions, living examples should be used 
for education about the national situation, attention should be 
paid to aesthetics education, and efforts should be made to 
educate students about the Constitution and to be law-abiding 
citizens. 
  Commenting on issues of common concern within educational 
circles and in society as a whole, Li Lanqing said that more 
resources must be channeled to education. He said: The State 
Council departments concerned and governments at all levels must 
carry out the specific requirement which Premier Li set out in 
his report -- that governments must increase their investment in 
education. All provinces must increase their educational 
budgets in light of their goals for educational development. 
Meanwhile, in accordance with the needs for deepening various 
reform projects, educational funds should be raised through 
various avenues and continual efforts should be made to improve 
the mechanisms that ensure inputs for education. Li Lanqing 
pointed out: Teachers hold the key to educational reform and 
development. Governments at all levels are duty bound to raise 
teachers' social status and their pay as the "Teachers Law" 
requires. This responsibility should be shared by governments 
at all levels and all relevant departments. While the Central 
Committee, the State Council, and governments at various levels 
have done a great deal of work since 1993 in paying teachers' 
unpaid wages, new arrears have again been incurred. This 
problem should never be treated lightly. We must clearly 
understand that teachers' being able to receive their wages in 
full and on time is an important provision of the "Teachers Law" 
as well as a basic right of the vast number of teachers. It is 
a direct responsibility of governments at all levels to resolve 
and guard against the problem of the delayed payment of 
teachers' wages. Principal leading comrades of all party 
committees and governments must seriously approach and resolve 
this problem. Li Lanqing also commented on issues concerning 
teachers at nongovernment schools, the unauthorized 
establishment of universities and colleges, unauthorized student 
enrollment, improving the quality of meals at universities and 
colleges, and subsidizing students who have financial 
difficulties. 
  Li Lanqing told all localities and departments that they 
must 
promptly convey the guidelines laid down in the educational 
conference and organize the vast number of cadres and masses to 
study Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and Comrade Li 
Peng's report. He said: Relevant departments of the State 
Council and party committees and governments of all provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities under the central 
government's direct jurisdiction must earnestly study and draw 
up plans and measures for implementing the guidelines laid down 
by the conference. He stressed: Implementing the "outline" as 
well as the views on implementing the "outline" is the 
responsibility of governments at all levels. Party committees 
and governments at all levels should place the implementation of 
this "outline" high on their agendas and should draw up specific 
measures for implementing the "outline." Leading cadres must 
earnestly change their leadership style and methods of work; and 
principal leaders must personally investigate, study, and handle 
major problems arising from implementing the "outline." 
  In his speech, Ding Guangen said: This conference was an 
important conference in China's history of educational 
development. The conference is a complete success thanks to the 
direct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, as well as to the efforts exerted by comrades attending 
the conference. Education has a close bearing on training 
personnel for the 21st century, on China's economic 
revitalization, and on the nation's future. We must display the 
spirit of holding ourselves responsible for the state and the 
nation and earnestly follow through with the assignments put 
forward by the conference so as to create a situation in which 
China's educational cause will continue to thrive.

<F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bi Quanzhong (3968 0356 </F>
1813) and XINHUA reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yin 
Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376): "Shoulder the Heavy Task of 
Educational Reform and Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The party Central 
Committee and the State Council are holding the second national 
education conference to mobilize the whole party and all of 
society to implement seriously "the outline of the reform for 
and development of education in China." The conference is 
another milestone in the development of the education of the 
Chinese nation. 
  At the first national education conference in 1985, Deng 
Xiaoping delivered an important speech which established a 
strategic position for China's educational work. A great 
historic leap was made from 1985 to 1994. 
  "The hope of revitalizing the nation lies in education, and 
the hope of revitalizing education depends on teachers." After 
hearing General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important speech and 
Premier Li Peng's keynote report, the delegates have been 
greatly inspired. The main topic for discussion during the 
conference is how to face the development opportunity and 
challenge in the 21st century, to deepen further the educational 
reform, to accelerate the development of education, to improve 
the overall quality of the Chinese nation, and to train 
qualified personnel who span this century and the next. A 
salient feature of the conference is that the principal 
responsible comrades of all provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions are present discussing education and pledging 
to take the initiative in improving educational work. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Attach Strategic Importance to Education </H5>
  The delegates hold that the party Central Committee, the 
State Council, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have always attached 
importance to education in the overall development strategy of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Jiang 
Zemin has pointed out in his speech to the conference the need 
to always treat education as a fundamental issue linked with the 
socialist modernization drive and with the historic fate of 
socialism. We should treat education as something of strategic 
importance and pay attention to the development of education. 
  Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju linked education with the strategic 
task of concentrating on the development and opening of the 
Pudong area and making Shanghai an international economic, 
financial, and trade center as soon as possible. He pointed 
out: "Marching toward the 21st century, Shanghai should have 
first-rate education commensurate with its status as a 
first-rate city." In education, Shanghai should play the role 
of a training base and train a large number of qualified 
personnel for the whole country. At the same time, it should 
open up more channels of international cooperation and turn 
itself into one of the bridges spanning China and other parts of 
the world in education. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said: In the 
Beijing region, there are 67 universities and colleges, of which 
24 are national key institutes of higher learning. We can and 
should develop education in the capital and make it the best 
education of the highest standard in China. 
  The conference is a mobilization meeting for the 
implementation of the "outline." The delegates say that the 
speeches of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng 
have inspired them, while also giving them a sense of urgency 
and pressure. Yan Haiwang, secretary of the Gansu provincial 
party committee, said: In order to attain the objectives set 
out in the "outline," it is crucial to have a strategic vision 
and to put the development of education above everything else. 
From now on, all provinces should make efforts to truly enhance 
understanding and step up publicity so that the whole party, all 
of society, and particularly the number one party and government 
leaders will firmly establish the notion of giving the highest 
priority to the development of education and perform actual 
deeds, and the leaders at all levels will fulfill their duties. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Deepen Reform and Promote the Development </H5>
of Education 
  The delegates consider the keynote report made by Premier Li 
Peng on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council to be in conformity with reality and to be practical and 
feasible, because it contains both the general concept and 
specific measures for implementing the "outline." It is 
necessary to seize the opportunity, deepen reform in an 
all-around way, and promote the development of education in our 
country. 
  In China, the degree of economic and social development 
varies from place to place, and the educational development 
situation similarly varies. In the light of their region's 
educational priorities and problems, leaders from various 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions made efforts 
to explore new ways to expedite educational development. Hebei 
Governor Ye Liansong said in his speech that, to accelerate 
reform and development of vocational education in rural areas, 
the construction of county-level vocational education centers 
must be intensified. Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region CPC Committee, stressed that the most 
important way to help impoverished areas was to help them 
develop their education. Yunnan Provincial Party Committee 
Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out that, to popularize nine-year 
compulsory education as the "outline" required, the need to 
expedite educational reform and development must be fully 
understood, and there should be effective leadership, financial 
investment, support from the media, and the involvement of 
various social sectors. 
<H5>  More Essential Work Must Be Done for Education and Teachers </H5>
  The representatives maintained that, to firmly expedite 
educational reform and development, efforts must be made to 
provide education and teachers with essential support. 
  Representatives from Guangdong proposed that increasing 
educational investment was the fundamental measure for 
reaffirming education's strategic role and achieving educational 
development. They said: As the economy develops, we should, 
while increasing educational investment, appropriate and use 
educational budgets according to the principle of "underscoring 
the need for priority and urgent projects, taking into account 
the need for routine and less urgent projects, and devising a 
consolidated plan to be carried out step by step." 
  Jiangxi Governor Wu Guanzheng indicated that educational 
work 
must have adequate logistic support and more essential support 
must be available for education and teachers. Those in charge 
in Shaanxi's maintained that increasing teachers' pay and 
solving their housing problems were essential to stabilize the 
ranks of teachers and for educational development generally. 
They said Shaanxi had come up with many ways to solve teachers' 
housing problems and the province had achieved remarkable 
success in this area. 
  In recent years, Shandong has given priority to popularizing 
nine-year compulsory education and eliminating illiteracy among 
adults. Shandong Governor Zhao Zhihao said that, to succeed in 
these two areas, stronger contingents of teachers must be built. 
He added that improving teachers' overall quality was essential 
to revitalize educational development. 
  Achieving the objectives stated in the "Outline of the 
Reform 
and Development of China's Education" is a formidable but 
glorious historical task. 
  Revitalizing education and rejuvenating the Chinese nation 
are jobs that must be done as we approach the 21st century.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Society's Priority"] </F>
  [Text] A national education conference held in Beijing 
from Tuesday through Friday reviewed the initial fruits yielded 
by "The Outline of the Reform and Development of China's 
Education" in the first year after its publication in February 
1993. 
  China's education system has made tremendous progress since 
the birth of the People's Republic, and especially in the last 
15 years along with the economic reforms and China's opening to 
the outside world. 
  Top leaders have all repeatedly stressed the importance of 
education not only to the country's modernization programme but 
also to the future of the socialist State. 
  At the opening session of the just concluded education 
conference, President Jiang Zemin, also the Party's General 
Secretary, reaffirmed that hopes for rejuvenation of the nation 
lie in education. He urged that the development of education be 
truly given top priority. 
  As a matter of fact, with regard to a developing country 
such 
as China and against the background of the extremely fast 
advances of science and technology around the world, the 
importance of education can never be overestimated. "The Outline 
of the Reform and Development of China's Education" published by 
the Party's Central Committee and the State Council, stipulates 
the specific measures and targets for the development of 
education for the 1990s and the beginning of the next century. 
  The outline sets the goal of instituting throughout the 
whole 
country a system of nine-year compulsory education by the turn 
of the century and eliminating illiteracy among young and 
middle-aged people by that time. It also formulates plans for 
better streamlined and more efficient higher education and calls 
for faster expansion of vocational and continuing education. 
  According to the State Education Commission, primary 
education is by and large available to all children in areas 
inhabited by 90 per cent of China's population; 
lower-intermediate education is available to most children in 
major cities and developed areas. The illiteracy rate among the 
young and middle-aged has dropped to about 7 per cent compared 
with the pre-liberation figure of 80 per cent. 
  College enrollment in 1993 was 2.63 million, up by 16.1 per 
cent from the previous year and a record high so far. For the 
first time in history, the enrollment in professional schools at 
the upper-intermediate level exceeded that of ordinary 
upper-intermediate schools -- an indication of the significant 
restructuring of education in China so that it becomes more 
rational and better suits the actual needs. 
  However, the development of education is still plagued with 
problems that call for strenuous effort. 
  Shortage of funds is the No 1 problem. Though the 
government, which has little money to spare, has done the best 
it can, the outlay on education in 1993 covered just 3 per cent 
of the gross national product (GNP), while the average of world 
developing countries was 4.1 per cent. The government promises 
to raise educational spending to 4 per cent of GNP by the end of 
the century. Other sources of funding are being sought, too. 
  Teachers are still not adequately paid, and many of them are 
not decently housed. All this has led to a serious brain drain, 
with a concomitant adverse effect on the quality of education. 
  Then there is the problem of dropouts. Whether under stress 
of poverty or because the household needs a helping hand, 
dropouts from lower-intermediate and primary schools reached 7.1 
per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively last year. 
  The fact that most of the top officials of the central and 
provincial-level governments were present in the just-completed 
conference shows that the decision makers are fully aware of the 
problems and seeking measures to tackle them effectively. 
  The successful conference certainly can be expected to boost 
China's education, enabling it to better serve the urgent 
requirements of the fast-growing economy and the long-term 
interest of our nation.

  [Text] Nanchang, June 17 (XINHUA) -- China now has more 
than 40,000 private schools including 16,990 kindergartens, 
4,030 primary schools, 851 middle schools and 800 colleges and 
universities. 
  Of the higher learning institutes, 15 have been authorized 
by 
the State Education Commission to confer diplomas and the rest 
are supervised by provincial, regional or municipal educational 
and administrative departments. Apart from that, there are 
still around 30,000 private schools engaged in short-term staff 
training, vocational education and other social and cultural 
education. 
  The private schools are well in compliance with the market 
economy in how they are run, from interior management to their 
hiring of teachers. These schools have extended their range 
from adult education to primary, technical and higher education. 
  Private school students generally pay for their education 
themselves and find their own jobs after graduation. 
  In Shanghai, private schools have now turned to training 
urgently needed personnel in the fields of financial insurance, 
real estate development, and foreign-related trade and law. 
  In 1987 the agricultural province of Jiangxi set up a 
correspondence college to help rural areas to prosper. Already 
132,000 students have graduated from the college. Now the 
correspondence college has set up branches, tutoring stations 
and classes all over the province. They all focus on one or 
more special skills and have greatly helped to promote the 
development of local agriculture. 
  With the boom in private education, China is enhancing 
law-making and management to guide it. 
  According to an official from the State Education 
Commission, 
a regulation on private education is to be published by the 
State Council soon and the Education Commission will also make 
detailed rules for practice.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Dissident Wang Dan's 48-hour hunger strike in 
protest against police harassment has only made matters worse. 
The security forces responded to the 25-year-old former student 
leader's protest by stepping up their surveillance and further 
restricting his already limited freedom of movement. 
  Throughout the hunger strike, six plain-clothes and 
uniformed 
officers were stationed at the gatehouse of Mr Wang's 
residential block in Beijing, preventing unauthorised persons 
from entering and stopping him from leaving. Even after his 
hunger strike finished at 9 pm on Friday, the police remained in 
position yesterday to ensure foreign reporters could not get to 
see Mr Wang. Speaking by telephone, Mr Wang admitted his 
protest had achieved no positive result and he was at a loss to 
know what to do next. "I have no plans at the moment. I will 
have to think about what I can do now," he said. 
  Unless he takes the drastic step of renouncing his 
commitment 
to the democracy movement in China and refrains from all 
political comment there is little chance the security forces 
will leave him alone. 
  Since his release from nearly four years in jail in February 
last year, Mr Wang has been under routine police surveillance 
and forced to leave Beijing on several sensitive political dates 
and during the visits of high-ranking Western government 
officials. The strain and the pressure of continual police 
harassment is beginning to tell. Mr Wang cannot get a job 
because of his political record and every time he writes a 
commentary or talks to the foreign media, he is questioned by 
the police. With the long-running battle over China's Most 
Favoured Nation trading status now over Mr Wang can no longer 
count on pressure from the West to help his situation. 
  Just about the only way out would be for Mr Wang to leave 
China altogether and study abroad but then he runs the risk of 
not being let back into China. The prospect of becoming a 
political exile like Han Dongfang or Wang Juntao does not appeal 
to the young democracy activist who is dedicated to improving 
human rights in China. 
  Meanwhile, the wife of a man who tried to organise a non- 
government labour organisation said he had been missing for 
three weeks and was feared arrested. Police refused to confirm 
or deny they detained Liu Nianchun, said his wife, Chu Hailan. 
She said police only told her to "go home and wait for news". 
Three other men who joined Mr Liu in trying to organise a 
National Alliance to Protect Labourers' Rights were known to 
have been arrested. They are Beijing University law professor 
Yuan Hongbing, Wang Zhongqiu and Zhang Lin. Mr Wang was a 
student of Professor Yuan, while Mr Zhang was a former student 
activist during the 1989 democracy movement and later organised 
workers and peasants in Anhui Province in central China.

<F P=106> [Unnattributed "special dispatch": "Wang Dan Ends His </F>
Hunger Strike, But Says He Will Not Yield to Public Security 
Police"] 
  [Text] Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement in Beijing and who was on a 48-hour 
hunger strike in protest against public security police watching 
him day and night, ended his "symbolic" action quietly at his 
Beijing residence at 2100 yesterday evening. However, when 
answering a question from a reporter of this newspaper by 
long-distance telephone, Wang Dan said that he would certainly 
escalate to a move of confrontation if the public security 
police stepped up the above-said surveillance. 
  Wang Dan said he was feeling weak as his current hunger 
strike was the longest he had experienced since 4 June 1989. As 
it was anticipated, the public security police remained 
indifferent. He thinks that his personal safety is less 
guaranteed now than at any time before, including his time in 
jail. His present situation is precisely as former U.S. 
President Roosevelt said: "Living in the freedom of terror." 
According to his judgment, the authorities around-the-clock 
surveillance is aimed at controlling his remarks on one hand, 
and threatening and intimidating him on the other. He believes 
he has never said anything wrong or false, so he will not shut 
his mouth because of that. However, he pointed out that if the 
public security bureau's surveillance is stepped up, he would 
employ another method to escalate his protest. 
  Wang Dan said that the public security's close watch of him 
had caused a lot of inconvenience in his daily life. He was 
unable to call on some friends whom he wanted to see, because 
"no one is willing to have contact with policemen." 
  He also disclosed that when he returned to his home town in 
Shandong around 4 June this year, he had stayed the night at an 
inn, and now that inn has been closed up.

  [Text] Beijing and Sichuan are locked in disagreement over 
the outflow of migrant labour from the country's most populous 
province. 
  Sichuan, which has more than 100 million people and China's 
largest number of superfluous farm labourers has come under 
criticism from Beijing and other provinces for failing to curb 
the outward movement of migrant workers. But the leadership of 
the province, headed by maverick Governor Xiao Yang, has 
protested that stopping the migration would harm the local 
economy. 
  In a recent internal meeting, Mr Xiao defended the practice 
of the superfluous farm hands looking for work, mainly in the 
rich coastal provinces. 
  "During harvests and other busy times, the rural work hands 
stay in the fields," Mr Xiao said. 
  "In slack seasons, they go outside the province and look for 
work. They provide cheap labour for the richer provinces and 
remit their earnings back home. This is a sound economic 
principle for labour management." 
  Other Sichuan cadres have also complained that they lack the 
funds to provide social insurance or unemployment benefits for 
extra rural labour. 
  Beijing and the coastal provinces, however, have put 
pressure 
on the Sichuan Government to at least set a quota on the number 
of its "exports" of migrant labour. 
  It is understood that Guangdong as well as some of its more 
prosperous cities, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have agreed 
to make financial contributions to Sichuan in exchange for an 
end to unwanted Sichuanese labourers. 
  Chinese sources said no agreement had been reached between 
Sichuan and Beijing on the "quota" to be set or the 
"compensation" the province would get in return. Meanwhile, 
sources said Beijing was working on a nationwide strategy to 
control the flow of population. This follows the de facto 
breakdown of the old system of residency permits, where 
government permission was required for rural people to live and 
work in the cities. 
  Employers, including managers in state factories in 
prosperous coastal cities like Shenzhen, however, are often 
reluctant to expel "underground" labourers from other provinces 
because they are a source of cheap labour.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS) -- Facing the threat of 
AIDS, China has decided to launch a health protection education 
and publicity campaign to prevent and control spreading of AIDS. 
On a seminar on countermeasures against AIDS recently co-hosted 
by the Policy Research Office of the State Council and the 
Ministry of Public Health, relevant officials discussed and 
listened to research results made by experts and scholars in 
order to put forward suggestions and countermeasures against 
AIDS. 
  It was reported that during the period from January to May 
this year, 118 HIV cases had been newly discovered in 10 
provinces and cities. Up to date, based on monitoring conducted 
within a small scope of 300 million people, 1361 HIV cases had 
been reported to be discovered in 22 provinces, cities and the 
autonomous regions of the Mainland including 1106 cases 
involving the Mainland residents, 255 cases involving foreigners 
and overseas Chinese. Among them, there had been 40 AIDS 
victims and 22 of them had been dead.

  [Text] San Francisco, June 16 (CNA) -- The Republic of 
China [ROC] hopes to join the United Nations in order to make 
more contributions to the prosperity and stability of the 
Asia-Pacific region, ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Frederick 
Chien said Thursday [16 June]. 
  Chien made the statement in a panel discussion of the 1994 
world forum in Beaver Creek, Colorado. The forum opened 
Thursday and will continue through Saturday. 
  The forum, sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, 
annually brings together more than 100 ranking government 
officials, senior business executives, and renowned academics 
from around the world to exchange views on the world's major 
concerns ranging from politics and regional security to economic 
issues. 
  Dignitaries attending the 1994 forum include former U.S. 
President Gerald Ford, Former French President Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing and former British Prime Minister James Callaghan. 
  During the panel discussion entitled "Asia at Center Stage 
-- 
Trade, Security, and Human Rights," Chien noted that Asia is 
expected to contribute 50 percent to global economic growth in 
the next decade. 
  Asia, which currently outperforms other world areas in 
employment and inflation, is a major source of the U.S. trade 
deficit, he pointed out, adding that how to narrow the trade 
imbalance has become a major concern. 
  Moreover, he said, the ROC has played an important role in 
the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. He also stressed that 
the investments made by Taiwan manufacturers in Mainland China 
have had a strong impact on the development of the mainland 
economy. 
  The panel discussion was chaired by James Lilly, former 
director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in 
Taiwan and former U.S. ambassador to Beijing. 
  Chien, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Beaver Creek 
Wednesday. This is the fourth consecutive year Chien has 
attended the forum.

  [Text] According to a mainland-based source, the three 
defendants in the Chientao [Qiandao] Lake case may be executed 
by shooting on 20 June. 
  After hearing the news, Hsu Hui-yu, secretary general of the 
Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] replied helplessly: The case 
may end up this way -- with no definite answers. Hsu Hui-yu 
said: The issues concerning the Chientao Lake case will not be 
resolved through hastily shooting and executing the three 
defendants, but through investigating and clarifying the truth 
of the case and on paying compensation for losses. Hsu Hui-yu 
believed: Resolving these issues is more realistic than holding 
routine or high-level talks. The mainland's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] has written three 
letters to the SEF within two or three days, proposing to hold, 
at an early date, a second set of Ku- Wang [Ku Chenfu-Wang 
Taohan (Gu Zhenfu-Wang Daohan]) talks, a second set of 
Chiao-Tang [Chiao Jenhe-Tang Shupei (Jiao Renhe-Tang Shubei]) 
talks, and a fifth round of routine consultations. 
  Hsu Hui-yu indicated: According to SEF-ARATS agreements on 
contacts and talks, it is necessary for both sides to hold 
talks. However, the problem at present is the agenda. We cannot 
simply say hello, rush through the meetings, and bid one another 
goodbye. 
  Hsu Hui-yu indicated: On the one hand, the mainland wants to 
hold talks with Taiwan. On the other, it has not responded to 
the issues of settling the aftermath of the Chientao Lake case. 
We really find it hard to understand this situation. 
  Recently, the ARATS has successively facsimiled three 
letters 
to the SEF, urging high-level SEF-ARATS talks. Commenting on 
the situation, SEF officials indicated: The aftermath of the 
Chientao Lake case has yet to be resolved. The mainland should 
at least express its sincerity in settling these issues before 
the SEF and the ARATS can properly hold follow-up consultations 
and high-level talks.

  [Text] Taipei, June 18 (CNA) -- The former RCA Taoyuan and 
Chupei plants and surrounding areas were declared to be 
"seriously contaminated" by the Industrial Technology Research 
Institute Friday [17 June]. 
  Results of the institute's random testing of water from 
private wells and reports of three foreign industrial consulting 
firms have confirmed alarming rates of organic-solvent 
contamination in the surrounding areas, institute officials said. 
  Water in 18 of the 40 wells within a one-kilometer radius of 
the Taoyuan plant were found to be contaminated with 
trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Tetrachloroethylene 
found in water samples taken from well No. 4 registered 210 
parts per billion [ppb], which is 42 times higher than the 
government-allowed maximum of 5 ppb. 
  Reports of the Bechtel Corp., which was contracted by 
Thomson 
Consumer Electronics Co. to investigate pollution at the RCA 
plant in 1990, showed that tetrachloroethylene in the plant's 
production wells was found to be at levels ranging from 10 parts 
per million [ppm] to 1,100 ppm, or 200,000 times higher than the 
allowed maximum. 
  Thomson, a French-based firm, began using the RCA plant in 
1988 after it secured the plant from the U.S.-based General 
Electric Co. [GE], which bought RCA in 1986. 
  GE had hired the U.S. industrial consultant D&amp;M Co. to 
do 
investigation possible contamination around the Taoyuan plant in 
1988. 
  The institute said that both GE and Thomson knew about the 
toxic waste but did not take preventive measures to offset any 
negative impacts, such as informing plant workers and residents 
in the neighborhood to refrain from drinking underground water 
in the area. Instead, the two companies chose to bury the 
contaminants in 11 wells at the Taoyuan plant and four wells at 
the Chupei plant. 
  Eight other wells in the vicinity of the Chupei plant, now 
owned by Japanese-based Ushio Co. which produces halogen lamps, 
were also found contaminated with tetrachloroethylene, the 
institute said. 
  The contaminants, however, could be derived from other 
sources, it said. Situated behind Ushio is Philips Taiwan, 
while Yuloong Styrofoam Co. lies opposite the Chupei plant. 
  According to medical research data, trichloroethylene and 
tetrachloroethylene may be carcinogenic and are damaging to the 
liver, heart, and central nervous system. 
  The environmental protection administration has decided to 
speed up operations to enable tap water to be supplied to 
residents in the vicinity of the two plants from a source other 
than groundwater as soon as possible. 
  Meanwhile, the construction affairs department of the 
Ministry of the Interior announced that it will freeze an 
application by the current owner of the Taoyuan plant to use the 
land for commercial or residential use rather than for 
industrial use.

  [Text] Legislation enacting Hong Kong's last two budgets 
plus the preliminary stages of Governor Chris Patten's political 
reforms may be invalid because of a major constitutional 
blunder, the Sunday Morning Post can reveal. 
  It has emerged that changes allowing John Swaine to replace 
the Governor as President of the Legislative Council last year 
did not complete the process of becoming law until seven weeks 
after his election. As a result the validity of up to 125 Hong 
Kong laws, including the sensitive electoral reforms that form 
the basis of Mr Patten's on-going row with Beijing, has been 
questioned by legal experts. 
  The Hong Kong Government and the Foreign Office yesterday 
denied there was any reason for such doubts, but constitutional 
experts warned that the unprecedented situation had potentially 
devastating consequences. A clerical error in the Foreign 
Office meant the necessary amendments to the Letters Patent and 
Royal Instructions had not undergone essential parts of the 
process of becoming law, understood to include being signed by 
the Queen, before they were gazetted in Hong Kong on February 18 
and 19 1993. Mr Swaine was elected President on February 19. 
  Constitutional experts said this suggested the gazettal -- 
and Mr Swaine's subsequent election -- were invalid. Since the 
amendments only come into effect when properly gazetted, that 
would mean they are still not in force. It would also mean Mr 
Patten constitutionally remains Legco President, and raises 
doubts about the validity of the 125 laws passed under Mr 
Swaine's stewardship. 
  "This is not just some technical irregularity, it means Mr 
Swaine is presiding over Legco without any legal authority," 
said University of Hong Kong senior law lecturer Dr Nihal 
Jayawickrama, who spent seven years handling such amendments as 
secretary for justice in Sri Lanka. "Law making is a very 
formal process. The whole point of the rule of law is that 
there are steps which have to be taken in the correct order: 
what they seem to have done is mistakenly take the final step 
too early, and then tried to fill in the blanks afterwards." 
  Constitutional expert Professor Peter Wesley-Smith, also a 
University of Hong Kong law lecturer, said only the courts could 
now decide if the 125 laws were valid. "There's never been a 
case on anything like this before: it could go all the way to 
the Privy Council," he said. 
  The Government yesterday denied that the blunder had "any 
effect on the validity of anything done in Hong Kong". A 
Constitutional Affairs Branch spokesman admitted "formalities" 
relating to the Royal Instructions amendment were only completed 
on March 24, 1993, and the Letters Patent amendment was 
finalised even later, on April 15, 1993. However, the spokesman 
insisted this did not affect the amendments' validity since they 
were approved in draft by the Queen -- the first stage of the 
process towards becoming law -- at a Privy Council meeting on 
December 17, 1992, more than two months before Mr Swaine's 
election. 
  Despite the spokesman's statement, government officials are 
known to be privately concerned that the blunder leaves local 
laws open to challenge in the courts, although they insist any 
such challenge would be unlikely to succeed. It is understood 
the administration -- which has known about the problem for more 
than a year -- privately urged the Foreign Office to correct the 
blunder, but was rebuffed. 
  Constitutional experts said that only a special Act of 
Parliament, or a fresh Letters Patent listing all 125 laws, 
would remove the uncertainties caused by the error. 
  Legislators who, until now, have been told nothing about the 
blunder, are expected to quiz Deputy Secretary for 
Constitutional Affairs Leung Chin-man about it at a 
Constitutional Development Panel meeting tomorrow morning. 
Panel chairman Andrew Wong Wang-fat said while the mistake was 
understandable, the cover-up was inexcusable. "This is truly a 
major foul-up," he said. "They should have rectified it as soon 
as they discovered the error: the more you try to cover up, the 
graver it becomes. We now have to see how we can validate 
everything Legco has done since then (February 1993). Until 
that is done there will always be uncertainty: this puts all 
the constitutional reform bills in jeopardy." 
  Legislative Council legal adviser Jonathan Daw, also 
previously unaware of the blunder, said: "The facts, as 
presented, appear to be of concern and no doubt members will 
wish them to be investigated." 
  In London, Labour Member of Parliament Gerry Bermingham will 
this week table urgent questions in the House of Commons, 
seeking more information from Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
about the blunder. Mr Bermingham, whose attempts to obtain 
information on the amendments from the British Government have 
so far been rebuffed, said he wanted "to dispel the cloud of 
mystery which the Foreign Office seems to have thrown around 
this subject". "It is becoming increasingly difficult to 
ascertain the date the orders came into force. Nobody seems to 
have copies of the original documents," he said, after the House 
of Commons library informed him copies of the amendments "seem 
to be missing". "Questions need to be asked as to when the 
orders were actually signed by the Queen and what, if any, 
legislation was passed through Legco in accordance with the 
terms of the orders. If there was, then there must be a serious 
constitutional question over the legality of such legislation. 
[no close quotation mark as published] 
  A list of constitutional amendments, recently issued to 
legislators in Hong Kong, carefully concealed the error but did 
admit that: "following approval by the Privy Council, a number 
of formalities have to be completed before the amendments are 
ready to be gazetted in Hong Kong". Listed as examples were 
receiving Her Majesty's signature, affixing of the Great Seal 
and passing under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet". [no begin 
quotation mark as published] 
  Dr Jayawickrama predicted the Government would resist taking 
action to correct the blunder, in the hope that no court would 
be prepared to strike Hong Kong laws down. But he warned this 
would send the wrong sort of signals to Beijing. "This is very 
dangerous, these are constitutional matters and you can't just 
treat them so lightly," he said.

  [Text] Organised crime syndicates may use Hong Kong as a 
base to trade in nuclear weapons, police have been warned. 
  Assistant Commissioner David Hodson, the Deputy Director 
(Crime), said yesterday it was clear that tough new laws were 
needed. 
  Latest international intelligence showed that organised 
crime 
might seek to use Hong Kong as a base for arranging deals to buy 
weapons of mass destruction, especially in relation to targeting 
nuclear storage depots in the former Soviet Union. He said the 
territory was vulnerable to profits from nuclear arms sales 
being laundered locally, if it had not already taken place. 
  Mr Hodson also lamented the failure of local legislation to 
fight money laundering. 
  "It is an example of a maximum problem scenario," he said on 
the risk of nuclear infiltration. "We have to be prepared for 
the worst -- and hope for the best. 
  "We have got to keep up with the times. We need to be able 
to make sure we can keep these people from abusing our financial 
laws, to stop organised crime from using this place as a scene 
for financing this sort of activity. And, of course, laundering 
the proceeds of this activity." 
  In the United States, FBI director Louis Freeh and the CIA 
head, James Woolsey, have repeatedly voiced their concern about 
the threat of organised crime hoarding stockpiles of nuclear 
material capable of being used in terrorism. The problem stems 
from the collapse of security in the former Soviet bloc and the 
formidable strength of Russian organised crime. 
  The German Federal Police -- the Bunderskriminal -- last 
year 
reported 243 "incidents" involving breaches of security with 
nuclear-related material. 
  In April, Mr Woolsey told a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee that Russian crime was "actively involved" in the 
"illegal transport and sale" of nuclear weapons. He said the 
CIA paid "particular attention to the potential illegal sale of 
fissionable nuclear material". 
  "We've not seen significant quantities of weapons grade 
materials or any other nuclear warheads smuggled out," he said. 
  "But there have been... reports of thefts of low grade 
nuclear materials. In many cases the thieves or smugglers have 
been apprehended." 
  Mr Hodson said U.S. authorities rated Hong Kong-based 
organised crime as one of the most significant threats to their 
national security. He added it was unthinkable that Asian 
criminals would not try to become involved in nuclear 
transactions. 
  Mr Hodson said Hong Kong maintained "unimpressive" 
laundering 
laws and had "hardly an impressive record" in seizing the 
proceeds of crime. This made the territory ripe for brokering 
sophisticated criminal enterprise. 
  He said it was disheartening that no one had been convicted 
of laundering. 
  "We have to play our part. I think we have got to learn 
lessons from other countries. 
  "We have got to recognise that organised crime, in its many 
forms, is a very different animal now than what it was 20 to 25 
years ago." 
  When asked of the threat of nuclear deals being organised 
from Hong Kong, he replied: "I think it important that we take 
reasonable, rational measures to protect ourselves from it. 
  "I am saying these are the concerns expressed by highly 
respected leaders. 
  "Traditionally, police have investigated crime after it 
occurred but we can no longer afford to take this sort of 
approach -- we must go after it. 
  "When you have strong organised crime, you have something 
that is an ongoing activity. 
  "You become aware of the people involved in this kind of 
activity. But it requires a different approach -- a different 
style. 
  "It is also international in nature and we have to look at 
things occasionally from the viewpoint that it is essential we 
play our part on the international scene." 
  Mr Hodson's comments highlight the concern felt by police . 
  It also marks the depth to which morale has slipped in 
senior 
ranks over the failure for 23 months of the Legislative Council 
to pass the Organised and Serious Crimes Bill.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "First Nuke Station `Safe and Reliable'"] </F>
  [Text] China's first self-designed and self-built nuclear 
power station has met all safety requirements after running at 
full capacity for almost two years, according to an official 
survey. 
  The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang Province, with a 
generating capacity of 300 megawatts, has been free from 
accidents since operations began, the survey said. 
  The results were released by the National Environmental 
Protection Agency (NEPA) and China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC) 
at a press conference over the weekend in Beijing. 
  "The Chinese-built reactor has shown to be safe and 
reliable," said Wang Yangzu, deputy head of NEPA, calling the 
station a major breakthrough in China's nuclear technology. 
  And because of the success, provinces like Liaoning, Hainan, 
Fujian, Jiangsu and Shandung are seeking sites and conducting 
feasibility studies for nuclear plants, said Li Dingfan, deputy 
general manager of CNNC. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency sent two 
pre-operation 
review missions to Qinfihan in 1989 and 1991 and reported that 
construction was "of high quality and has been carried out at a 
satisfactory level which is universally acknowledged." 
  Since trial runs started in August 1992, the plant yielded 
3.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity by the end of May. 
  No problems were detected in the toxic waste treatment 
systems and radiation gauging system. 
  Data shows that the radiation volume discharged in waste 
water is less than one-thousandth of the State limit, and the 
inert gas discharged is lower than one-hundred-thousandth of the 
State permit. 
  The independent regular tests conducted by the Zhejiang 
Environmental Radioactivity Monitoring Station also reported no 
change in the radiation level of the surrounding environment. 
  "We have paid special heed to protecting resident health and 
to keeping land free from pollution from the very beginning," 
said Qin Jianqiu, vice general manger of the plant. 
  He said refueling and renovations will proceed smoothly this 
year and promised that safety standards in 10 important areas 
will he examined. 
  "Facts have clarified previous doubts about nuclear 
electricity," Wang said. "It is a reliable and clean energy. 
  "Our policy is to actively push the development of nuclear 
energy while exerting strict supervision over it," Wang said. 
  Li Dingfan predicted that nuclear stations will emerge as an 
important source of energy in China in the years ahead.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Adding iodized oil to 
an arterial infusion of chemicals is effective in treating 
late-stage gastric carcinoma (cancer of the stomach), according 
to physicians at the Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to the 
Shanghai Medical Sciences University. 
  The morbidity rate of stomach cancer is among the highest of 
all types of cancer. Advanced-stage stomach tumors cannot be 
removed surgically, and chemotherapy is the only way to ease 
pain. 
  Since the early 1980s hospitals all over the world have 
administered infusions of chemicals through arteries. But under 
such treatment only about 25 percent of the victims can live one 
year. 
  Iodized oil is a kind of embolism agent. When it is infused 
into the stomach artery it can selectively deposit itself into 
and around the small blood vessels of the tumor, and cut the 
blood supply to it. Thus, it kills or inhibits the expansion of 
cancer cells. However, it will not reduce the growth of healthy 
cells. 
  According to Wang Xiaolin, one of the staff physicians at 
the 
hospital, the chemicals carried by the iodized oil can stay on 
permanently to kill tumor cells, and hopefully cure the cancer. 
  Experts have appraised the therapy as a safe, simple and 
effective one.

  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (CNS) -- The Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences [CASS] invited tenders for the first time for 
some of its key research projects in order to encourage 
researchers to take up difficult subjects and to produce 
substantive success. Such a practice is aimed at enabling the 
academy to further build up a competitive and incentive 
mechanism. 
  The Director of the Scientific Research Bureau of the 
academy 
Mr. He Bingmeng, said in an interview with this agency that the 
academy had formulated regulations of such bidding on a trial 
basis. He added that the regulations stated that the academy 
would offer public bidding each year for some key research 
projects in order to ensure high quality results. 
  The traditional practice employed by the academy for key 
projects started with applications by each of its institutes 
which would be discussed by the Scientific Research Bureau. The 
applications were then submitted to the academy for final 
appraisal and approval. The main shortcoming of such practice 
lay in failure of highlighting the key projects which in turn 
led to fewer number of researchers who took up such projects. 
  The Vice President of the academy, Mr. Ru Xin, said that 
there were some 460 treatises last year as the result of 
research on specific topics, together with 530 investigative 
reports, 2,500 academic papers not including translated and 
academic references. All these totalled 150 million Chinese 
characters. Mr. Ru frankly acknowledged that the success in 
terms of quantity was rather great but there were not many of 
high quality while most of them were of general level and some 
even were of low quality. 
  The bureau made public some guidelines for the bidding which 
covers 12 research projects including research on situation of 
and solution to state-owned enterprises which are in serious 
loss, research on loss of state-owned asset seen in the 
transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises, 
research on division of revenue and expenditure by governments 
at various levels and a shift of revenue between governments, 
legal protection on the build-up of clean administration, policy 
on absorption of surplus of rural labour force in main urban 
areas and research on relationships between China and Japan as 
well as the United States in economic cooperation in Asia and 
Pacific region. 
  The 12 items make up one seventh of key projects set by the 
academy for the entire year. The period of time for such 
bidding was between May 10 and June 30 which is open to all 
researchers of the academy on a basis of fair competition and 
the most suitable candidates will be chosen. The academy 
specially appropriated RMB [renminbi] 680 000 to fund the 
research items under the bidding. Mr. He said that in order to 
ensure high level outcome from these projects, the academy 
suggested to carry out joint research on these items and 
organized research teams featuring various disciplines and 
institutes as well as experts and scholars.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli by Xie Geng </F>
(6200 1649), Li Zhengping (2621 3630 1627), and Qian Fengyuan 
(6929 7364 0337); place and date not given: "Financial and 
Taxation Reform Is Progressing Smoothly, Implementation of the 
Budget Is Basically Normal--Interview With Minister of Finance 
Liu Zhongli"] 
  [Text] The financial and taxation system reforms, which 
were implemented this year, are now having a major and 
deep-going effect on our country's economic life. The operation 
of the new systems has, over nearly five months, produced new 
situations and new problems in economic life and has attracted 
the wide attention of people in all spheres of society, 
especially those in economic circles and enterprise circles. 
Thus, our reporters visited Liu Zhongli, minister of finance 
and concurrently head of the State Administration of Taxation, 
and asked him to give his views on several questions which are 
of great concern to people. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] Financial and taxation reform and financial 
and taxation work are the most important aspects of economic 
life this year. All sides have shown great concern about the 
operation of the new financial and tax systems and the current 
financial situation. Could you please give us some idea of the 
situation in these areas? 
  [Liu] The current financial situation is, speaking overall, 
quite good. First, the implementation of the financial system 
and tax system reforms is going quite smoothly, and there are no 
major problems. This year, reforms of all major aspects of the 
financial and tax systems are being carried out concurrently. 
This provides the advantage of coordination, but certainly also 
exacerbates the risks of reform. In order to guarantee the 
normal operation of the new financial and tax systems and 
realize our anticipated goals, from the beginning of the year, 
we have greatly concerned ourselves with the implementation and 
operation of reform. Seen from the current situation, the 
levying of all taxes is now handled completely in accordance 
with the new tax system, and there has been a marked decrease in 
losses through tax leakage. The reaction of foreign businesses 
and the majority of domestically funded enterprises to changes 
in tax burdens have been stable, and no instances have occurred 
of wild price rises resulting from the tax system reforms 
affecting financial income. The revenue-sharing financial 
situation is now being implemented level by level in accordance 
with the requirements of the central authorities and no major 
distortions have occurred. The fiscal revenue situation is 
basically normal in central and local financial administrations. 
The work of setting up branch taxation organs is now being 
firmly grasped and carried out. As to the new situations and 
new problems which have appeared in the implementation of the 
new systems, on the basis of much investigative research, we 
have carried out overall analysis and, in a timely way, 
formulated appropriate response measures for dealing with these 
situations and problems. From the beginning of the year until 
now, we have sent out over 100 documents and telegrams resolving 
problems which have appeared in the operation of the new 
systems. Second, in a situation where quite a number of reform 
measures have been implemented, the budget implementation 
situation is basically normal. From January to April, national 
fiscal revenue totaled 125.246 billion yuan, an increase of 
22.607 billion yuan or 22 percent compared with the same period 
last year. Of this, growth in added-value tax, operational tax, 
and other major tax types was over 30 percent. National fiscal 
expenditure over the same period was 116.751 billion yuan, an 
increase of 22.357 billion yuan, or 23.7 percent over the same 
period last year. Expenditure in major areas such as 
transformation and tapping potential, education, science and 
technology, health, public security, and procuratorial and law 
work increased by over 30 percent. Comparing revenue and 
expenditure over the January to April period, we see that 
revenue exceeded expenditure by 8.495 billion yuan, a higher 
figure than in the same period last year. Of course, in budget 
implementation, there have existed and will continue to appear 
factors which reduce revenue and increase expenditure. These 
have already received a high degree of our attention. At the 
same time, there has been steady growth in the national economy, 
and from January to April, the industrial output value of 
enterprises at or above township level grew by 18.4 percent. 
Also, in April, industrial output value and realized profits of 
state-owned enterprises saw a turn for the better compared with 
the first quarter. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] Some people believe that since the beginning 
of this year, the price increase index has been quite high and 
that this is closely linked with the reform of the taxation 
system. What are your views on this? 
  [Liu] In accordance with the taxation reform plans, this 
year, the reforms will not increase the overall tax burden on 
enterprises. Thus, in theory, there should not be a direct 
effect on the overall level of prices. However, seen from the 
actual situation, the structural readjustment of the tax system 
will result in the level of tax burden of some enterprises 
increasing, while for some others it will fall. Enterprises for 
whom the tax burden has been reduced will not necessarily reduce 
their prices, while it is very likely that some of the 
enterprises which will see an increased tax burden will, as a 
result of cost pushes, raise their prices. However, speaking 
overall, the influence of the tax system reforms on price 
indexes will be limited. Seen from the situation this year, the 
main factors leading to price rises will remain the excessive 
scale of capital construction, inflation in consumption funds, 
and enterprise cost-push factors. In resolving the inflation 
problem, we must make efforts into several areas. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] It is claimed that since the beginning of 
this year, many state-owned enterprises have experienced 
operational difficulties. Do you think this is linked with the 
tax system reforms? 
  [Liu] Seen overall, the operational situation of 
state-owned enterprises is normal, and their development trend 
is good. As for the problems which exist in some enterprises, 
some of the problems are quite complex and require specific 
analysis. Seen from the fiscal angle, after a large number of 
enterprises implemented the "General Rules Governing Enterprise 
Finances" and the "Enterprise Accounting Standards," interest 
and repayment of long-term loans which had originally been 
expended from profits, were entered as costs, and there were 
also increases in depreciation rates. This reduced their book 
profits or potential losses were converted into explicit losses. 
However, funds which the enterprises were able to expend not 
only were not reduced, but actually increased. Thus, in the 
light of the implementation of the "Rules" and "Standards" noted 
above, this situation is normal and falls within our 
expectations. Of course, the tax system reforms are having some 
effect on the burdens of enterprises. This influence is mainly 
of three types: 1) Tax burdens in a small number of industries 
have increased. In this respect, we have already adopted 
appropriate measures to deal with the effects. 2) In accordance 
with the requirements of industrial policy, when planning our 
programs we have appropriately raised the tax burden levels of a 
small number of industries and products and abolished some 
inappropriate tax exemption policies for some enterprises. This 
should be noted as being correct and the changes in the economic 
situation resultant from this are normal. 3) Where, over an 
entire industry, the general tax burden is not high but some 
individual enterprises complain about the raising of the tax 
burden; this suggests a problem of enterprise operations. Such 
problems can only be resolved by enterprises improving 
management themselves. We cannot carry out, on the policy 
level, any individual readjustment of such enterprises. 
Otherwise, the tax system reforms will be entirely distorted 
and will be unable to achieve the anticipated goals. It also 
needs to be explained that the majority of problems which 
various sides have reflected to us about the tax system reforms 
and enterprise burdens have been rational and have already been 
basically resolved. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] According to my understanding, at present, 
some local financial administrations and especially county-level 
financial administrations are suffering a tightness of funds and 
some are even in a situation where they cannot issue wages. 
What is your assessment of this? 
  [Liu] The implementation of the revenue-sharing system this 
year is being carried out gradually and, as of yet, this has not 
affected the immediate financial strength of localities. Thus, 
the reforms should not have affected the financial resources and 
payment capability of the localities. In particular, the 
central financial administration's timely readjustment of the 
funds transfer ratio played an important role in improving the 
financial expenditure situations of the localities. As for some 
localities which are experiencing tightness in their finances 
and are even unable to issue wages, the reasons differ with each 
locality. Each region has its own situation. However, as far 
as the whole country is concerned, a common problem is that the 
degree of wage readjustment for staff and workers in 
administrative and institutional units exceeded the standards 
set down by the state. This is a problem worthy of attention. 
In order to safeguard stability, it is hoped that financial 
administrations at all levels will seriously organize well their 
various revenue channels and, in making expenditure 
arrangements, will give precedence to guaranteeing the issue of 
wages. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] According to the budget approved by the 
National People's Congress at the beginning of the year, this 
year, the Ministry of Finance is going to issue over 100 billion 
yuan of treasury bonds. This is a major element in our 
country's economic life this year. At the same time, it has 
also attracted wide attention from circles in society. Please 
advise us of the most recent situation in the issue of state 
bonds. 
  [Liu] This year, because of the attention given by leaders 
at all levels, the adoption of appropriate measures, and the 
cooperation from banks and other relevant bodies, the issue of 
state treasury bonds has gone very well. Up to 21 May, 60.295 
billion yuan of state treasury bonds had been issued. Of these, 
the sale of two-year maturity state treasury bonds has already 
reached 82.7 percent of the figure set as the target for the 
year, while the sale of three-year maturity treasury bonds has 
completed 63.28 percent of the planned annual figure. 
Throughout the country, half of provinces and cities have 
completed or exceeded their tasks in terms of selling two-year 
maturity state treasury bonds. At present, the situation in 
terms of the issuance of state treasury bonds is still looking 
good. We are still putting efforts into the work and are 
striving to complete the issue tasks within the specified issue 
period. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] Seen from the present situation, what is your 
appraisal of the prospects for this year's financial and tax 
reforms and budget implementation? 
  [Liu] Perfecting the reform measures will still require a 
lot of work. In the following several months, there will also 
appear many factors which will reduce revenue and increase 
expenditure. Thus, in respect of the overall annual situation, 
we must not be blindly optimistic and relax our efforts. 
However, if we put all our efforts into it and do good work, we 
will be able to absorb the effects of the disadvantageous 
factors. I believe that if we are able to firmly uphold the 
macroeconomic regulatory and control targets; maintain a 
rational scale of investment, scale of credit and price levels; 
and continue to put efforts into organizing revenue, controlling 
expenditure and seriously handling the problems which appear in 
reform, it will be fully possible to guarantee the normal 
implementation of the reforms and to complete the annual 
budgetary tasks.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently promulgated the "Outlines of the State's Industrial 
Policy for the Nineties" and the "Policy for the Automobile 
Industry." 
  The State Council Information Office held a news conference 
for Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today. During the 
news conference, Ye Qing, vice minister of the State Planning 
Commission, briefed the reporters on these two documents and 
answered their questions. 
  Ye Qing said: The "Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy 
for the Nineties" and the "Policy for the Automobile Industry," 
which serves as one of the special industrial policies in the 
outlines, are important measures to adapt to the new situation 
of China's socialist market economy; strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic control; readjust and maximize industrial 
structure; and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development 
of national economy. 
  Ye Qing said: In light of the objective rules of 
industrialization and modernization as well as national 
realities and structural changes in China, the outlines forward 
major subjects needed to be solved when China readjusts and 
maximizes its industrial structure in the nineties. The 
subjects are: First, it is necessary to continue to strengthen 
the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national 
economy and comprehensively develop the rural economy. Second, 
great efforts should be made to build basic industries and 
improve a situation in which basic industries and 
infrastructural facilities are backward. Third, it is necessary 
to accelerate the growth of pillar industries so as to 
invigorate the national economy. Fourth, it is imperative to 
reasonably readjust foreign trade system and strengthen the 
ability of China's industrial sectors in international 
competition. Meanwhile, massive efforts should be made to 
develop the tertiary industry and accelerate the development of 
high and new technological industry. It is necessary to maximize 
the industrial structure and promote industrial and technical 
standards so as to have an even better industrial distribution. 
  The "Policy for the Automobile Industry," which was 
promulgated at the same time as the outlines, clearly defines 
China's goal for the development of the automobile industry; 
policies for industrial organization, industrial technology, and 
industrial distribution; as well as policies concerning foreign 
funds and foreign trade. This special industrial policy has 
been put into force. 
  In accordance with the outlines' requirements, the State 
Council will also continue to examine and approve special 
industrial policies for transportation, telecommunications, 
construction, electronic, machine-building, and petrochemical 
industries; and policies related to foreign funds, foreign 
trade, technology, and readjustment of industrial organization. 
  Ye Qing said: The "Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy 
for the Nineties" also clearly stipulate the procedures for 
formulating industrial policies and their implementing measures. 
The outlines stipulate the following rules: (1) The State 
Council will decide the state's industrial policies. State 
Planning Commission will be responsible for the overall work of 
studying, formulating, and coordinating the state's industrial 
policies. The State Planning Commission will initiate, with 
help from departments concerned, the work of formulating various 
industrial policies. (2) It is necessary to set up a reviewing 
system for the state's industrial policies. (3) It is necessary 
to set up a system that serves to guarantee the implementation 
of the state's industrial policies. (4) It is necessary to set 
up a system for the supervision, inspection, and appraisal of 
the state's industrial policies. (5) People's governments at 
provincial level should study and formulate, in accordance with 
the requirements of the outlines and local realities, specific 
rules for the implementation of these outlines and submit them 
to the State Planning Commission for the record. 
  The outlines also put forewords "Some Regulations Concerning 
the Standards of Economic Scale for Fixed Asset Investment 
Projects (First Group)," which clearly stipulate the standards 
of economic scale for a group of fixed asset investment projects.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Property Rights Clarified"] </F>
  [Text] A senior official has refuted rumours that China 
plans to sell property rights of money-losing State-run firms to 
foreign investors. 
  The central government is stepping up efforts to verify the 
assets at State-owned industries, said Ni Di, Vice-Minister of 
the State Administration of State Property. 
  "But, it is not the central government's intent to prepare 
for foreign purchases, as some papers said," he told Business 
Weekly in an exclusive interview. 
  After two years in pilot areas, the State Council plans to 
expand its verification of State-owned firms' assets nationwide. 
  The move is of crucial importance in the development of a 
socialist market economy, since it provides accurate information 
about assets. 
  He pointed out that it is untrue that the government plans 
to 
encourage domestic and foreign businesses to purchase 
loss-making large and medium-sized State-owned firms. 
  The government is, however, encouraging some State-owned 
firms to use part of their equipment, workshops, and 
infrastructure to lure domestic and foreign investors. 
  The potential benefits for State firms include updating 
equipment and operating methods, making them more competitive. 
  But it does not mean the State has allowed trading of 
State-owned firms' property rights. This practice was 
suspended, according to a circular issued by the State Council 
in April this year, the vice-minister said. 
  Setting up ventures between some State-owned firms and 
foreign investors therefore does not mean any change in 
government-dominated ownership of property, he added. 
  It is "normal" for some small State firms and State 
enterprises "in severe difficulties" to contract, lease and 
transfer some assets to other businesses, or even go bankrupt. 
  But Ni said such activities should be carried out according 
to State laws and regulations. 
  He denied rumours that the government is to set up a special 
fund to revitalize State-owned enterprises. Nearly 50 per cent 
of the State's annual budgetary investment is now used to 
develop State businesses and factories. 
  The government has special funds to build transport 
facilities and supply coal, electricity, and oil. It also 
issues State treasury bonds annually. 
  The funds and the money raised from selling these bonds are 
used for supporting State businesses and firms. 
  So Ni believes it is not necessary to have a special 
"revitalizing" fund for State-owned enterprises. 
  Other official sources say there now are nine State-owned 
firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. They hope to 
raise foreign currency to update their manufacturing 
technologies. 
  Yet all these firms still control the majority of their 
shares. as well as their property rights. 
  It is also a common practice among State-owned firms to seek 
foreign investment for ventures China has more than 180,000 
foreign-funded ventures which have helped revamp production 
technology in 26 industrial sectors. 
  The State Statistics Bureau said a survey of 2,586 
loss-making State firms in the country's eight major provinces 
and municipalities shows the majority are in the red due to poor 
management.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State To Issue Price Guide To Curb </F>
Inflation] 
  [Text] The government will provide price-range guidelines 
to curb inflation and crack down on illegal profiteering by 
businesses charging exorbitant rates for their goods or services. 
  The guidelines will be interpreted and turned into 
regulations by local authorities. 
  The aim is to prevent the violation of business ethics and 
disorder on the market, according to the State Planning 
Commission. 
  Excessive profits do not reflect the true relation between 
supply and demand, he said. 
  There is not yet enough competition to guarantee proper 
pricing and the commission is drafting a document designed to 
help create a fair market and protect consumers in the meantime, 
said Hong Feng, vice-director of the Department of Market and 
Price with the commission. 
  The department is currently working on the document which 
will be approved and issued by the State Council in the form of 
a decree. 
  But the decree will not set the prices of all commodities, 
said Hong. 
  The government will see to it that profits obtained by 
businesses do not exceed "a reasonable range based on average 
social cost of manufactured goods or services, he said. [no 
ending quotation mark as received] 
  It was up to the localities to work out specific regulations 
to decide what that range should be in the light of local 
conditions. 
  Shanghai spearheaded this mission in April by issuing "the 
Temporary Code against Price Cheating and Excessive Profits," 
which is believed to have informed the drafting of the national 
decree. 
  Hong admitted that it is difficult to define what was 
"illegal profiteering" because it could not be decided simply by 
fixing specific profit margins. 
  High-profits alone do not indicate profiteering, he said. 
  If high-profits are obtained by reducing production costs 
and 
introducing new technical methods, it would be normal and should 
be encouraged, he said. 
  Profit margins must be in line with general price standards 
and the balance between supply and demand in any given commodity 
market, the vice-director noted.

  [Text] Washington, June 19 (XINHUA) -- A new calculation by 
the World Bank has raised China's per capita gross national 
product by one fourth to 470 U.S. dollars. 
  This is the first sharp rise in more than a dozen years, 
when 
the bank has been putting China's per capita GNP at around 370 
to 380 dollars. 
  China used to be the 11th largest economy. But in "world 
development indicators" released today, China's GNP ranks the 
eighth, after the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain 
and Canada. 
  With a total population of 1.16 billion, China is now the 
28th poorest country in the world, according to the World Bank's 
updated list. 
  Since 1980 when China joined the World Bank, there has been 
little change in the calculation of China's GNP. "World Bank 
Atlas" published in December put China's per capita wealth at 
380 dollars. 
  According to sources from the China executive director's 
office, the bank started to reevaluate China's GNP early this 
year. 
  The change of methodology, bank officials said in 
interviews, 
is aimed at more accurately reflecting the changing nature of 
China's economy, which grew 12.8 percent and 13 percent in 1992 
and 1993 respectively. 
  Since 1981, the bank has supported 140 projects in China, 
with cumulative lending at 18.6 billion dollars. China borrowed 
3.2 billion dollars from the bank in 1993, making it the bank's 
largest borrower.

by the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of 
Finance, the Ministry of Supervision and the State Auditing

enterprises for theatrical performances, sports games, for the 
filming of movies and television dramas will be strictly 
prohibited. 
  Third, administrative departments and responsible business 
departments will be banned to illegally apportion any kinds of 
expenses from enterprises including the borrowing of funds, 
collection of charges and fees of service, information, 
publicity and tests.

departments, responsible business departments and social 
organizations will be allowed to force enterprises to subscribe 
newspapers, magazines and books.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The Communist Party of 
China (CPC) Central Committee has decided to send 20 
investigation groups to some provinces and ministries for 
inspection of anti-corruption work. 
  The groups will inspect 24 ministries and 24 provinces and 
autonomous regions at the end of June or in early July. 
  At an assembly of the central inspection groups held today, 
Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Politburo, said that in the 
second half of this year, especially in the third quarter, the 
anti-corruption struggle should be deepened. 
  He said that although the struggle has achieved progress, 
the 
development of the struggle in the provinces and ministries is 
uneven. 
  Wei, also the secretary of the CPC Central Commission for 
Discipline Inspection, urged the groups to listen widely to 
officials and people's opinions on the anti-corruption struggle 
and study the problems in the current struggle. 
  The inspection will focus on leading officials' 
self-restraint in fostering an honest working style and the 
progress in dealing with major cases and rectifying unhealthy 
tendencies in different trades. 
  The members of the groups are from the departments of the 
Central Committee of the CPC, National People's Congress, and 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court and the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate. Some leaders of non-communist 
parties and individuals without party affiliation will also take 
part in the inspection.

Telecommunications Wu Jichuan and Vice Governor Zhang Qimei of 
Zhejiang attended and spoke at the conference. 
  The conferees called for improving the organizational 
planning and structural readjustment of first-class postal trunk 
networks this year, by rationalizing the postal transportation 
system, actively setting up independent and exclusive air postal 
routes, ensuring a good job in the readjustment and distribution 
of motor vehicle postal transportation networks, and 
accelerating the completion of auxiliary equipment for 
heavy-duty trucks and other supplementary facilities in a bid to 
raise the postal transportation capacity. 
  They said: During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, there 
will be 20 postal transport planes, 36,000 km air trunk postal 
routes operated by the ministry, 9,700 motor vehicles for trunk 
postal transportation, and 280,000 km of motor vehicle trunk 
postal routes operated by the ministry, thereby gradually 
setting up a relatively independent postal transport system 
which comprehensively utilizes planes, motor vehicles, trains, 
and ships and which combines routes operated by the ministry 
with those operated by other departments consigned by the 
ministry.

"Central Authorities Decide To Allocate 7 Billion Yuan To Carry 
Out Enterprise Bankruptcy Pilot Schemes in 18 Cities"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- According to an 
authoritative source here, the central leading body recently 
decided that, beginning in late June, bankruptcy experiments 
should be carried out in two or three selected large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises in 18 cities. The state 
will allocate 7 billion yuan to help those workers employed by 
the enterprises that go bankrupt. The central authorities hold 
that allowing state-owned enterprises which cannot halt business 
losses to go bankrupt is the key to the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system. 
  The source said: A central leader recently talked about this 
issue and said that a major task laid down by the central 
leading body for this year is to promote a modern enterprise 
system, while the key to the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system lay in the establishment of a perfect 
enterprise bankruptcy mechanism. Enterprises which can no longer 
stop business losses and repay their debts should go bankrupt, 
and enterprise mergers can be regarded as a solution within the 
category of bankruptcy. At present, the difficulty about 
exercising bankruptcy lies in placing workers. Thus, the state 
will allocate 7 billion yuan to make proper arrangements for the 
placement of workers and to set up special funds for writing off 
bad debts owed by bankrupt enterprises to the banks. 
Reportedly, according to conditions in difficult localities, 
each worker will receive about 20,000 yuan of compensation if 
the enterprise goes bankrupt and will then be separated from the 
enterprise for ever. At present, such dying enterprises still 
have to rely on bank loans to pay workers' wages. 
  The source said: The central authorities are firmly 
determined to let loss-incurring enterprises go bankrupt, 
because the Bankruptcy Law, which was formulated on the basis of 
consideration over a long time, will officially take effect in 
July. Since the law has been enacted, practice should be 
brought into line with the requirements of the law. Moreover, 
the central authorities held that there would be an opportunity 
next year to solve the problems in large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises. If experience can be acquired on such 
key issues as handling enterprise bankruptcy this year, this 
will be conducive to the thorough settlement of problems in 
large state-owned enterprises next year.

  [Text] Serving the country's economic development will be 
the top priority of the All-China Federation of Returned 
Overseas Chinese, said a top official with the group. 
  Getting overseas Chinese involved in mainland projects will 
be encouraged, Yang Taifang, the newly-elected chairman, said at 
the final session of the federation's fifth national conference 
in Beijing on Saturday. 
  Co-operation with the overseas Chinese will be expanded to 
trade, science and technology, culture and education as well as 
hygiene and sports. 
  Yang encouraged returned overseas Chinese to join the 
country's policy-making process. 
  In January, 1991, the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative 
Conference, China's top advisory body, for the ruling party and 
government, accepted the federation as a group participant. 
  Yang vowed at the meeting to develop the federation into a 
"home to returned Chinese and their relatives." 
  Yang, 67, is the former minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications and has wide connections with overseas 
Chinese. 
  To draft the laws pertaining to overseas Chinese, 
legislators 
must solicit opinions and suggestions from them. The 
federation, in turn, will support the government's efforts to 
protect the interests and rights of overseas Chinese and their 
relatives, he said. 
  If necessary, the legislature will set up new projects, Yang 
added. 
  He also said the NPC [National People's Congress] has sent 
several teams to investigate and prepare to draft laws that will 
protect overseas Chinese investors.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS)--The Director of the 
Financial Research Institute under the People's Bank of China, 
Mr Qin Chijiang, said that enterprises should turn the pressure 
resulted from the financial reform in the country into a driving 
force for changing their operational mechanism in ten ways. 
  First, they should realize a change of their property rights 
system, enabling themselves adapted to new practices required by 
a commercialized bank system. 
  Second, their industrial structure should be re-adjusted 
because commercial banks will examine the assets structure of a 
particular enterprise and confirm its payment ability when 
offering loans to it. 
  Third, their debt structure should also be regulated and 
their money-raising should be conducted in multi-ways. They 
should not entirely rely on bank loans. 
  Fourth, they should have flexible policies for their 
funding. 
Their equipment and other goods and materials unsuitable for 
their use should be sold out. Their technological achievements 
can also be transferred with pay to other entities. 
  Fifth, their fund-accumulating mechanism must be 
re-adjusted. 
Enterprises in Japan are practicing a high depreciation rate 
system and they realize renewal of their property through 
depreciation to promote their development. China's enterprises 
should learn from them to raise depreciation rate through 
reducing their profits. 
  Sixth, their organization structure should become more 
adaptable. 
  Seventh, their accounting system should be reformed and 
their 
accounts should be made open. They should practice a 
shareholding system. 
  Eighth, they must get more information and their sources of 
information should not only rely on government departments but 
should be gained through more channels. 
  Ninth, their trust for funding should be raised. They must 
keep their promises in payment of debt. 
  Tenth, their risk sense must be enhanced. They must pay much 
attention to risks from foreign debts, exchange rates and 
interests rates, besides that from their production.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- The General Office of 
the CPC Central Committee [CPCCC] and the State Council General 
Office recently issued a circular on exercising strict control 
over lottery ticket markets and on prohibiting approval to issue 
lottery tickets without proper authorization. 
  The circular says: In disregarding the relevant regulations 
of the CPCCC and the State Council, a small number of localities 
recently issued lottery tickets without the authorization of the 
State Council. The departments concerned are now dealing with 
this problem. To safeguard the overall state of the national 
economy, to ensure social stability, and to exercise strict 
control over lottery ticket markets, the General Office of the 
CPCCC and the State Council General Office, with the approval of 
the CPCCC and the State Council, hereby issue the following 
requirements: 
  1. The 1991 "Circular of the State Council Concerning the 
Strengthening the Management of Lottery Ticket Markets" and the 
1993 "Circular of the State Council Concerning the Further 
Strengthening the Management of Lottery Ticket Markets" clearly 
stipulate that only the State Council has the authority to 
approve the issuance of lottery tickets, and that no other 
localities and departments have such authority. The handling of 
lottery tickets whose issuance has been approved should be 
carried out in accordance with the plans approved by the State 
Council. The number of such lottery tickets issued or the 
methods of their issue should not be changed without 
authorization. Lottery tickets whose numbers are freely chosen 
by purchasers (including "six-number combination lottery 
tickets," "four-number combination lottery tickets" and "lottery 
tickets with numbers from 1 to 10,000") shall not be issued. 
The issuance of lottery tickets that are jointly sponsored by 
Chinese and foreign enterprises on China's territory shall be 
stopped. Relevant agreements reached with foreign partners 
concerning the lottery tickets are null and void. The circular 
issued by the General Office of the CPCCC and the State Council 
General Office reiterates that all localities and departments 
should conscientiously carry out this circular. They should not 
violate it for any reason. 
  2. All localities should conduct a self-examination drive to 
consolidate local lottery ticket markets. Rectifying measures 
should be taken in a set period for any lottery tickets that 
were issued by localities and departments, including lottery 
tickets whose numbers could be freely chosen by purchasers and 
lottery tickets that were jointly sponsored by Chinese and 
foreign enterprises on China's territory. In addition, 
conscientious efforts should be made to handle the problems 
arising from the cancellation of these lottery tickets. If 
localities and units still ignore orders and prohibitions and 
continue to approve or issue lottery tickets or purposely 
postpone the self-examination drive to consolidate the lottery 
ticket markets, their responsible leaders should be dealt with 
severely. 
  3. Printing firms not possessing the authorization to print 
lottery tickets are not allowed to print them. Printing firms 
which are assigned to print lottery tickets should not print any 
lottery tickets without first getting authorization from the 
State Council or from the departments authorized by the State 
Council. People's governments in all localities should organize 
local public security bureaus, industrial and commercial 
administrations, people's banks, and other relevant departments 
to strengthen the supervision and inspection of printing firms 
so as to exercise strict control over them. 
  4. Relevant departments of the State Council should 
strengthen their supervision and management of lottery ticket 
markets. The People's Bank of China is an organ under the State 
Council that is in charge of matters relating to lottery 
tickets. The People's Bank of China, with help from the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Physical Cultural and 
Sports Commission, and the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce, should try to do a good job of managing lottery ticket 
markets.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
General Office recently distributed the State Council Securities 
Commission's "Some Opinions on Resolutely Checking the 
Unregulated Development of the Futures Market," and it called on 
the parties concerned to carry out close coordination and to 
conscientiously implement them. 
  The "opinions" of the State Council Securities Commission 
pointed out that since the issuance of the "State Council's 
Circular on Resolutely Checking the Unregulated Development of 
the Futures Market" in 1993, localities and relevant departments 
have enhanced their supervision and management over the futures 
market and have taken some appropriate measures, which led to a 
certain degree of success. However, the problem of the 
unregulated operations of futures market has not been totally 
solved. The problems that are chiefly plaguing China's futures 
market are as follows: First, there are too many futures 
exchanges and brokerages, the futures markets are chaotic, and 
the operations of futures markets and brokerages lack 
standardization. Second, many exchanges engage in speculative 
cross-border futures transactions, which cause great losses to 
the state. Third, some futures trading brokerages' fraudulent 
practices against domestic clients lead to a great loss of 
foreign exchange. Fourth, despite its prohibition, illegal 
futures trading continues. Because China's futures market is 
still in the experimental stage, it is necessary to seek steady 
development based on the principle of "standardization, of 
enhancing legislation, and of subjecting everything to 
experimentation and to strict control." At present, emphasis 
should be placed on rectifying, consolidating, and enhancing 
management over existing futures exchanges and brokerages, 
particularly on exercising strict control over cross-border 
futures trading and on financial futures trading, and on 
resolutely cracking down on various types of illegal futures 
trading. 
  The "opinions" called on relevant departments and all levels 
of local governments to immediately stop examining and approving 
applications for setting up new futures trading exchanges and to 
carry out reexaminations and reapprovals of existing futures 
trading exchanges. Futures trading exchanges which were 
approved -- prior to the issuance of the State Council's 
"circular" -- by relevant departments or the people's 
governments of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, 
and of cities with provincial status, and which had already 
begun operating before the end of December 1993, will be handled 
according to the following two approaches. First, the majority 
of exchanges will cease to be named exchanges, and they will be 
treated as wholesale markets; they will be prohibited from 
carrying out futures trading transactions. Second, as for the 
small minority of exchanges which meet the operational 
requirements for futures trading, the China Securities 
Supervision and Management Commission (CSSMC for short) will 
assign experts to carry out a feasibility study on them. They 
will be selected to carry out a standardized experiment with 
futures trading only after undergoing a rigorous examination and 
approval process by the CSSMC and only after having been 
approved by the State Council. Those selected exchanges need to 
file again for registration with the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce. The CSSMC and relevant departments will 
be responsible for their supervision and management. 
  The "opinions" call for strict control over the scope of 
futures transactions with exchanges confining their business to 
commodity futures. Business involving financial futures 
transactions will be permitted for the time being, while no 
other futures business involving share indexes and other 
categories of indexes in China will be allowed. No futures 
brokerage companies will be permitted to engage in foreign 
futures transactions. Those who have already started this type 
of business shall not accept new clients or new orders, while 
those who have already taken positions should settle their 
positions before the delivery date or should carry out an actual 
delivery on the delivery date. Deposits remitted overseas 
should be recalled upon the settling of the position. National 
corporations with subsidiary futures business organizations 
already in operation before the issuance of the "opinions" may, 
with renewed approval from the CSSMC, conduct hedge futures 
transactions in foreign futures markets for the purpose of 
preserving value within their own line of business, on the 
conditions that they deal with designated foreign futures 
companies and that they deal in items authorized by the CSSMC. 
Foreign futures brokerage firms to be appointed for business 
transactions must be members of exchange clearance houses 
verified by the CSSMC. Banks designated for foreign exchange 
transactions, and nonbanking financial institutes authorized by 
the State Administration of Exchange Control [SAEC] to engage in 
the foreign exchange business, may, upon joint SAEC-CSSMC 
approval, take advantage of their foreign exchange futures 
business to engage in hedge futures transactions for purposes of 
value preservation under joint SAEC-CSSMC supervision and 
management. Operators engaged in the foreign futures business 
must obtain a license issued by the CSSMC. 
  The "opinions" also call for the stricter examination of 
various categories of futures brokerage companies and the 
suspension of new applications. Futures brokerage companies 
meeting CSSMC requirements must register themselves with the 
State Administration for Industry and Commerce before opening 
for business. In principle, both foreign-funded and 
Sino-foreign joint-venture futures brokerage companies are not 
required to reregister. It is necessary to strictly prevent 
state-owned enterprises and institutions from engaging in 
futures transactions, to resolutely investigate and handle 
various illegal futures brokerage activities, and to strengthen 
supervision over the futures market.

<F P=106> [By Gao Sizhang: "Call for Improved Bond Mart"] </F>
  [Text] China should increase efforts to build the low-cost, 
highly-efficient primary market for treasury bonds said an 
official with the Ministry of Finance. 
  "That will ensure the Ministry of Finance has easy access to 
financial resources," said Gao Jian, vice-director of the 
ministry's State debt administration. 
  Starting this year, the central government has barred the 
ministry from borrowing from the People's Bank of China to 
finance its deficit. As a result, the ministry has shifted its 
attention to the domestic treasury bond market. 
  However, the current selling format for treasury bonds poses 
a problem for the ministry. 
  To ensure bonds are bought, the central government relies on 
measures such as local government purchase quotas. 
  In highly-efficient, low-cost markets abroad, issue prices 
are determined by market supply and demand. 
  Second, the main subscribers in the primary market are 
financial concerns, including banks, securities firms and 
institutional investors. 
  Gao said many attitudes need to change to ensure a smooth 
treasury bond market. 
  "Measures should be co-ordinated to stabilize the whole 
process," he said. 
  These measures include establishing a market-oriented 
interest-setting mechanism. 
  Gao also said the interest rate of treasury bonds should be 
decided by market demand and supply. 
  In an underwriting syndication format, the rate should be 
set 
based on negotiations between issuers and underwriters or based 
on the tender prices determined by competitive bidding in 
auction format. 
  At present, the coupon rate is set up with reference to the 
bank deposit rate. 
  For several years, the rate of treasury bonds has been set 1 
to 2 percentage points higher than bank deposit rates. 
  Meanwhile, Gao said, central underwriting syndication should 
be expanded to replace local underwriting syndication. 
  Central underwriting refers to security intermediaries who 
directly sign contracts with the Ministry of Finance. In local 
underwriting, the ministry entrusts local governments to 
underwrite bonds. 
  This transition will require more primary dealers, who 
underwrite treasury bonds and bid for their price. 
  The system was introduced last year when 19 securities 
firms, 
trust and investment companies and banks were approved as 
primary dealers. 
  But they have not fully become a force in the primary 
market, 
Gao said. 
  He added that the primary dealer system will be effective 
depending on how much the central bank encourages commercial 
banks to hold treasury bonds as liquid assets. 
  Furthermore, Gao said, efforts should be made to improve the 
financial infrastructure, including setting up a national 
trading system to deal with paperless bond trading.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 18 (XINHUA) -- China's Huaneng 
International Power Development Corporation will be granted ADR 
(American Drawing Rights) to list stocks on the New York Stock 
Exchange from June 23. 
  According to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, this will be the 
first of China's second batch of five state-owned enterprises to 
be listed worldwide. 
  The other four are China Eastern Airlines, China Southern 
Airlines, the Shandong Huaneng Enterprise Group and the Tianjin 
Steel Tube Plant. 
  "This indicates that China's reform of its joint stock 
system 
is bringing this sector into line with the international 
standards and that its state-owned enterprises are arousing 
greater interest of business people overseas," an exchange 
official said. 
  The first batch of three Chinese state-owned enterprises 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange are operating smoothly.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Great Strides Seen in Trademark </F>
Protection"] 
  [Text] Chinese chocolate lovers used to be puzzled when 
they visited the store and found M &amp; M's, a U.S. brand, 
alongside W &amp; W's, a Chinese candy. 
  Similarly, Readers' Digest, a well-known U.S. magazine, was 
shocked when it discovered a popular Chinese periodical with the 
same name. And the world-renowned London-based newspaper 
Financial Times spotted a newspaper in Beijing using exactly the 
same name. 
  The two Chinese publications were later changed into 
"Readers" and "Financial News" as China strengthens the 
protection of foreign property rights. 
  For many foreigners doing business in China, one of the 
biggest headaches is protecting their trademarks and patents. 
All too often, brand names are stolen or fake products enter 
the market, hurting company sales. 
  Fortunately, overseas companies are happy to see that the 
Chinese Government is making great efforts to protect their 
property rights. 
  "The framework of China's laws provides protection which is 
as good as that of other Asian countries," said Jingzhou Tao, 
lawyer with the Beijing office of the American law firm Coudert 
Brothers, which was the first foreign law office allowed to 
practice in China. 
  China has also signed major international conventions in the 
area such as the Paris Convention in 1985, the Madrid Agreement 
for the International Registration of Marks in 1989, the Berne 
Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention in 1992, and 
the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms in 
1993. 
  "Intellectual property protection in China has undeniably 
improved throughout the past decade," Tao said. "At least more 
and more Chinese people are talking about this issue ." 
  Meanwhile, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce 
(SAIC) has intensified steps to crack down on counterfeiting and 
has achieved visible results. 
  For example, the trademark W &amp; W's, produced by a 
factory in 
Zhejiang Province, is no longer used. 
  China now protects not only registered brands, but also 
packaging, such as the bottling of cognac. 
  "However, we should admit that the enhancement [as 
published] 
of these laws requires much more time than the drafting and 
elaboration of the laws themselves," Tao said. 
  He said the anti-counterfeiting efforts will be more 
effective if China imposes tougher punishment on violators. 
  To prevent fake products, foreign investors should register 
their trademarks, patents, software and company names as soon as 
they enter China, Tao said. 
  And before legal action is taken, it may sometimes be more 
effective to pursue informal measures such as sending a warning 
letter or meeting with an infringer since they may be unaware 
they are violating the law, he said. 
  Victims may also approach the People's Court directly. Some 
cities, such as Beijing, have established intellectual property 
chambers.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- China has set up a 
phonographic association to protect intellectual property rights 
and to promote the development of its phonographic industry. 
  The primary task of the newly-founded body, called "China 
Phonographic Association" (CPA), is to protect phonographic 
product copyrights, Liu Guowei, chairman of the association, 
told XINHUA. 
  He said that in the protection of copyrights, it will firmly 
adhere to both the relevant Chinese laws and international 
conventions and fight against any activities of piracy and 
infringement. 
  All copyrights, membership or non-membership, domestic or 
overseas, should be protected by his association, he said. 
  He noted that piracy is a complicated problem. And most of 
the master compact discs are coming from overseas, but China 
hopes to make joint efforts with all foreign countries to crack 
down on piracy, he said. 
  But, he pointed out, China will not keep silent at any 
groundless attacks regarding the matter, referring to the 
denunciation by the British FINANCIAL TIMES on June 2 saying, 
"worldwide sales of pirate compact discs doubled to 75 million 
units last year, almost exclusively as a result of unauthorized 
production in China." 
  He said that the fact is overstated and distorted by the 
British newspaper. 
  The chairman said that the latest statistics compiled by the 
CPA show that although China has 30 compact disc production 
lines, the total output has so far been no more than 20 million 
yearly. 
  "We hope the British newspaper makes corrections of the 
error 
in a responsible way," he said. 
  The chairman concluded that his association is taking part 
in 
a nationwide campaign launched by the central government against 
infringement and piracy.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- A copyright official 
urged here today that overseas groups and individuals 
participate in China's copyright protection campaign. 
  "Chinese people are most directly harmed by copyright 
piracy. 
The country not only respects foreign copyright owners but also 
regards anti-piracy as a helpful activity for our own economic, 
cultural and scientific development," said Shen Rengan, 
vice-director of the State Copyright Bureau. 
  He said that copyright piracy has blocked the development of 
China's publications, film, and computer industries. 
  "Copyright protection in China is not an interim measure," 
he 
said, adding that the opening policy has quickened the pace of 
bringing China's copyright protection in line with foreign norms. 
  He noted that overseas people should come to realize this 
attitude and provide more active cooperation with the Chinese 
Government, including providing some techniques for copyright 
protection such as identifying and affirming foreign copyright 
owners. 
  Meanwhile, those overseas people whose copyrights have been 
violated in China should inform the Chinese side in time, so as 
to provide clues for China to find the violators. 
  According to Shen, currently all copyright pirates in China 
are illegal. Some culprits have contacts with or are even 
directly manipulated by overseas people. 
  He also said that Chinese people have shouldered more 
responsibilities in protecting overseas copyrights. However, 
Chinese works have been repeatedly pirated in other countries 
and regions -- a headache which has not been solved. 
  These works include books, video tapes, films and paintings. 
In recent years, cases of piracy of Chinese computer software 
have been found, for example, piracy of a Chinese-language input 
system and a Chinese-language desktop publishing system. 
  Shen noted that a joint action of cracking down on pirated 
recording tapes is still going on nationwide and has won great 
success, with several illegal production lines being destroyed. 
  A similar action on pirated books is planned, and in the 
future, copyright violators will be sentenced to jail terms 
instead of being fined.

  [Text] Beijing, June 19 (XINHUA) -- China will allow more 
overseas law firms to open offices in the country, especially 
those of high credit that could help bring in investment, an 
official from the Ministry of Justice said here today. 
  The number of pilot law firms from foreign countries and 
from 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will be increased from the current 
41 to around 100 by the end of 1995, said Shen Bailu, director 
of the ministry's lawyers administration department, in an 
interview with XINHUA. 
  "They will be allowed to open offices in more coastal cities 
and provincial capitals than the current five cities of Beijing, 
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou," Shen said, adding 
that the move is part of China's effort to meet the rising 
demand for foreign trade and economic cooperation. 
  However, the official noted, so-called "human rights 
lawyers" 
or "democracy lawyers," who might jeopardize China's social 
stability and investment environment, "will be barred from 
coming in." 
  Shen said China holds a tight rein on the operation of 
overseas law firms in the country, because "restrictions in the 
field of legal service are just common practice in the world." 
  Through pilot schemes, China is drawing experience on the 
administration of overseas law firms in China, he said. 
Relevant laws and regulations will be made to govern them in 
the next several years to safeguard the Sino-overseas exchanges 
and cooperation in the field of legal services, shen added. 
  The official said the overseas lawyers' offices have played 
an important role in introducing investors and projects to 
China. They have also handled quite a number of cases for 
Chinese clients and provided consultation for both government 
organs and enterpreneurs. 
  According to Shen, some 120 overseas law firms have lodged 
formal applications to his ministry to set up offices in China, 
whose economy is booming and where business opportunities abound. 
  While overseas law firms are coming in, their Chinese 
counterparts are planning to set up offices abroad, shen said. 
So far, two Chinese law firms have opened offices in the United 
States and Singapore. 
  But shen said his ministry will be strict in approving such 
offices to avoid random set-ups and only those with good 
business prospects might be ratified to venture into overseas 
markets. 
  The business operations of the two law firms abroad were 
both 
ranked "very good" by the ministry official.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- China's 
General Administration of Customs recently promulgated the new 
anticorruption regulations for customs, stipulating that customs 
personnel are not allowed to claim reimbursements on their 
private expenses from their working units; nor to use their 
official functions to seek favorable treatment and conveniences 
for the businesses run by their spouses, children, relatives, 
and friends in the import and export of goods beyond the limits 
of the established policies; not to engage in go-between 
business activities. 
  The General Administration of Customs promulgated the 
Customs 
Anticorruption Regulations in 1990, and the Regulations on 
Certain Concrete Issues Concerning Personal Relations Between 
Customs Personnel and People With Whom They Have Work 
Connections, in 1991. The General Administration of Customs also 
recently made certain amendments to these two sets of 
regulations. 
  The revised regulations maintain most of their original 
provisions. The new anticorruption requirements laid down last 
year also were officially written into the regulations. The 
customs are not allowed to run business enterprises, except for 
those providing logistics and technological support; nor to seek 
patronage from the institutions with which they have work 
relations; nor to participate in costly recreational activities 
specially arranged for customs personnel by the institutions 
with which they have work relations; nor to intervene in the law 
enforcement process by interceding for people involved in 
customs investigation cases.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS)--There are some facts summed 
in ten points about employment in China. 
  --As the idea on employment sees some change, the 
"life-long" 
employment receives great impacts. A survey shows that a mere 
one third of respondents have not yet changed their jobs. There 
was so much transfer of jobs last year which hit a record in the 
history of employment in China. 
  --Sense of value regarding employment strengthens to a 
certain extent and income differences widens. Employees tend to 
choose business entities which show great economic results and 
put emphasis on value of human resources. 
  --Autonomy of job seeking is rather strong. Individuals tend 
to choose career according to one's own desire and ability, 
reversing the job allocation employed under the planned economy. 
  --Quality of employees improves at a rapid pace. Vocational 
schools across the country offer job training while special 
training is also available for workers who want to find a job in 
another field. 
  --The number of employees working for enterprises of non 
public ownership hit the record high. There were about 24.67 
million workers with individually run business and 2.318 million 
workers with private business by the end of the previous year. 
The total number of such employees made up 4.5 percent of the 
gross work force across the country. Employment in individual 
and private business tend to go upwards this year. 
  --Competitiveness for employment tends to increase. The 
employment rate rose as the result of rapid economic 
development. Consciousness of stiff competitiveness for a job is 
therefore strong [sentence as received]. 
  --Sideline career becomes popular and such trend grows at a 
fast speed. There is nearly half of the work force in some main 
cities in southeastern part of China having sideline career. 
  --The wave of labour work force sees no sign of recession 
while the job seeking consciousness stands high in urban area. 
Those jobs in which work force is in great demand for their job 
nature and for low income offer more chance to labour workers. 
  -- Unemployment rate is low in southeastern part of China 
and 
high in northwestern area and such a gap tends to grow bigger. 
Nearly half of 500 cities across the country saw an unemployment 
rate not more than two percent in 1992 but there were some 50 
cities having an unemployment rate of over four percent and 
seven others even registering an unemployment rate as high as 
over ten percent. High unemployment rate is mainly centred on 
northwestern area. 
  --Re-employment of workers who were made redundancy by 
state-owned enterprises has become a serious problem.

<F P=106> [By Qiu Qi: "Industry Toils for a Competitive Edge"] </F>
  [Text] Liu Lihua, a slim young woman in her 30s, has been 
selling hot noodles every day in Beijing streets for three years. 
  Even in the teeth of wintry winds she doesn't give up the 
work. The reason is simple: It earns her much more than she 
makes in her other job at a cotton-spinning factory, which is 
choking on its debts. 
  As a vendor, she earns about 1,000 yuan ($115) a month, 10 
times what she gets from the factory. 
  "I just idle time away in my factory because I have little 
to 
do. Our products do not sell well, and the inventory is big," 
she said. "Many of us workers try to get extra pay from 
moonlighting." 
  Liu is one of the millions of textile workers feeling the 
squeeze of quasi-unemployment. They stay at work even though 
there's little to do. They draw pay that is extremely humble, 
and getting even worse as inflation continues to spiral upward. 
  More than 15 million workers are employed in China's 50,000 
textile enterprises. But in 39 major cities about half of the 
State textile factories are running in the red. 
  According to the most recent statistics, these enterprises 
lost 1.58 billion yuan ($182 million) in the first 10 months of 
1993. 
  Manufacturing is so decayed that the China National Textile 
Council, which governs the industry, has had to lease out some 
of its vacant offices in its Beijing headquarters to flourishing 
companies, both Chinese and foreign, that are engaged in 
healthier trades. 
  Many industry officials who once cherished their 
administrative power have "jumped into the sea"--plunged into 
the bracing waters of free enterprise. 
  Du Yuzhou, vice-chairman of the ministerial-level China 
Council of Textile Industry, admitted that efficiency and 
exports are slipping. 
  Exports grew by 6 per cent last year to $22 billion, but 
were 
offset by a flood of imported--and expensive--raw materials. 
This left net export income of only $10.7 billion. 
  The torpor of the industry belies the fact that China's 1.2 
billion people constitute the world's largest textile market. 
Its textile exports account for one-seventh of the world's 
total, and are the country's leading spinner of foreign exchange. 
  Nevertheless, the industry is facing harsh competition from 
abroad. Chinese textiles (including dyeing products) must cope 
with rising costs and outdated technology. 
  China lags behind such fast-growing powers as Hong Kong and 
South Korea. In addition, the emergence of a bundle of export 
processing zones in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, 
Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand offers 
international consumers cheaper alternatives to China [sentence 
as published]. 
  "Backward processing technology such as printing and dyeing 
has hurt the quality of China's textile products," said Zhou 
Xiang, a specialist at the China Textile Institute. 
  This conclusion is shared by at least one European fashion 
designer who sells her silk products in China. Although the raw 
materials and workers come from China, she points out that the 
printing is done elsewhere. 
  To prevent being squeezed out of the international market. 
the China National Textile Council has drawn up a blueprint for 
the industry's future. 
  Cutting production capacity and modernizing technology are 
considered the keys to a revival. 
  The industry plans to reduce capacity by one-quarter to 
improve efficiency and raise quality. By cutting back 
production at inefficient plants, the government can invest the 
savings in competitive ones. 
  The blueprint also calls for fostering more technology- and 
capital-intensive projects to make enterprises more competitive 
against foreign manufacturers. 
  Top exporters will receive more financial support in 
expanding sales. 
  The government is also encouraging companies to issue stock 
to raise badly needed investment capital . The country already 
has 69 standard joint-stock textile companies, of which 22 are 
listed on stock markets. 
  Some cities will lease out or auction off small and 
medium-sized State enterprises to help them restructure. 
  At the same time, township enterprises will have more 
chances 
to develop as demand grows from rural consumers with more money 
to spend. In 1992, the country's 190,000 township textile 
enterprises produced more than 97 billion yuan ($11 billion) 
worth of goods. 
  Output of the more than 380,000 village-level textile 
enterprises, meanwhile, amounted to 63.4 billion yuan ($7.3 
billion). 
  Reinvigorating the textile industry will also depend on the 
fast-growing domestic market, which is now learning the value of 
marketing as well as production. 
  Many factories that used to rely on wholesalers are opening 
their own sales outlets across the country. In addition, half 
of the 8.5 million self-employed Chinese are engaged in selling 
garments and textile products . 
  Authorities also encourage foreign participation in 
resuscitating the manufacture of textiles. According to 
incomplete statistics from the National Textile Council, the 
industry has more than 10.000 joint ventures, representing 
investment of more than $7 billion. 
  The investors include multinational corporations such as the 
DuPont Co. of the United States, BASF AG and W. Schlafhorstag 
&amp; 
Co. of Germany, and TPL of Italy. 
  Foreign capital has also come from government loans, 
international commercial loans and leasing operations.

  [Text] Beijing plans to break its own tax reform rules by 
offering tax breaks to the two domestic airlines which have been 
given approval to seek listings abroad. The planned relief will 
cut their enterprise income tax (EIT) by nearly half. 
  The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is 
currently negotiating with the State Tax Bureau to reduce EIT 
paid by China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines from 
the unified 33 per cent tax rate down to 18 per cent, according 
to reliable sources. The tax reduction is proposed as a 
subsidies arrangement, under which the two airlines would submit 
the full amount to the tax bureau first, after which 15 per cent 
would be returned to the CAAC, which looks after the whole 
family of state-run airlines in China. The concessionary period 
will run for two or three years under details still being 
finalised by the State Council. The planned tax cuts would save 
the two airlines about US$4.5 million (about HK$34.7 million) 
per year. 
  Alfred Shum, partner of Ernst and Young, said the tax cut 
would give a facelift to the airlines' profit forecasts. Their 
annual income currently amounts to about US$30 million each. 
Beijing is determined to develop its lucrative aviation 
business, which has long been enjoying a premium 18 per cent 
EIT, compared to a tax rate which sometimes reached 55 per cent 
for domestic enterprises before the tax reform came into effect 
on January 1. 
  Other main state-run airlines including Air China, China 
Northern Airlines, China Northwest Airlines and China Northeast 
Airlines are also on the list to benefit from the tax cut 
measures. But business insiders said the concessions would 
arouse jealousy among the remainder of the second batch of 22 
companies seeking overseas listings. Mr Shum said he believed 
the tax breaks could set a precedent for the other companies 
seeking overseas listings. 
  Joseph Fu, partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, said China 
would be unfair if it granted tax concessions to only one 
industry. "China will appear to overrule its own rationale to 
achieve the unification of income tax rules if it does give the 
tax premium to the aviation industry," he said. 
  Li Yonggui, general deputy commissioner of the State Tax 
Bureau, denied tax concessions had been granted to the two 
airlines. "We have always been trying to unify the tax system. 
Although we granted tax privileges to lower the first batch of 
H-share companies' EIT rates by 15 per cent, we are not going to 
repeat it this time," said Mr Li.

  [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The reform of China's 
distribution system for crude and refined oils is going on 
smoothly. 
  From May 1, China instituted reforms of its distribution 
system for crude and refined oils so as to stabilize oil prices 
and normalize oil transactions on the market, rationally 
allocate oil resources and promote the production of crude oil. 
  In the past month, despite planned rises in prices of crude 
oil, retail sales prices of refined oil all over the country had 
declined due to the reduction of intermediate links in the 
distribution of refined oil. 
  Sources said that at present, the oil prices and oil market 
in China are stable and the channel between supply and demand is 
unblocked. 
  The reform of China's oil distribution focuses on the 
balance 
between supply and demand in oil production and consumption and 
coordination between domestic and international oil resources 
and the oil market; rational allocation of crude oil processing 
resources and refined oil resources; maintenance of rational oil 
price differences according to regional differences. 
  The reform also aims to reduce the intermediate links in oil 
distribution, unclog oil distribution channels and set up risk 
price funds for crude and refined oils. 
  The State Council stressed that from now on the state will 
exercise unified control over the prices of crude and refined 
oils. 
  All refineries must implement the sales prices of refined 
oils set by the state and all gas stations must strictly follow 
the stipulated oil prices in sales transactions. 
  No party, government or military organizations are permitted 
access to the wholesale or retail sale of crude oil and refined 
oil. 
  The State Council also stressed the role of the sales 
department of the China National Petrochemical Corporation as a 
main channel in the distribution of refined oil. 
  The government also stipulated that the refineries will 
directly supply big oil-consuming sectors including railways, 
transportation, civil aviation, armed forces and oil export 
companies.

  [Text] Harbin, June 17 (XINHUA) -- An increasing number of 
potential overseas investors are turning their eyes to China's 
agricultural development projects. 
  In the recent influx of foreign investment, the construction 
of a new foreign-funded farm, the country's biggest in farm 
production joined by overseas firms, has started in the vast 
stretches of land under the jurisdiction of Fujin city, in 
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. 
  The project, covering an area of 38,000 hectares of 
wasteland, was jointly financed by China and the Republic of 
Korea with investments totalling 227 million yuan (26.7 million 
U.S. dollars). It is expected to be completed in three years and 
provide an annual grain output of 105,000 tons. 
  According to an official with the provincial agricultural 
development department, in Heilongjiang there is a total of 8.6 
million hectares of farmland and 1.8 million hectares of 
cultivatable wasteland. The rich land resources are becoming a 
main attraction for overseas business people who seek to invest 
in China. 
  He said that the World Bank also has shown great interest in 
the development of arable lands in this area. It has approved 
loans of 120 million U.S. dollars in developing land resources 
in the province. 
  The loans will be used in cultivation of wastelands, 
improvement of low-yield lands and grasslands and processing of 
sideline products. The project will start in 1997. 
  Also, a Thai- and Malaysian-funded project involving 10 
million U.S. dollars is being built in Hulin County of the 
province. When the farm is completed, all its sideline products 
will be exported. 
  To boost the development of its agriculture, the provincial 
government has implemented preferential policies for use of 
wastelands. 
  In other parts of China, including Liaoning and Jilin 
provinces also in the northeast, the local governments have also 
made efforts to encourage foreign investors to invest in 
agricultural projects, particularly in the processing of 
sideline products. 
  Xiao Zhuofu, vice-governor of Liaoning, said that his 
government has decided to select more farmlands for development 
by foreign firms. A farm experimental center will be built near 
Jinxi city to show how overseas investment has been attracted to 
the province, he said. 
  The Chinese central government has long paid attention to 
development and construction of grain production bases in 
northeast China. 
  Toward the end of the 1970s, one farm in Heilongjiang 
Province took out loans of one million U.S. dollars to import 
more than 60 sets of farm machinery. 
  Later, the country's first modernized farm, called "Honghe 
Farm," was built in this province with a loan of 110 million 
yuan from the Japanese Government in the form of compensation 
trade. About 20,000 hectares of wasteland were cultivated. The 
loan had been paid years ago with the soybeans produced in the 
farm, which is now affiliated with a new town. 
  So far, a number of such farms have been built in this vast 
fertile plain.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS) -- According to the Ministry 
of Agriculture, though the area under cultivation of summer 
grain crops this year in the country is seven million mu less 
than that of last year, China is still expected to have a good 
summer harvest this year. 
  The area cultivated for rape seeds this year is about 84.2 
million mu of land in the country, 7.7 million mu more than that 
of last year. The actual harvesting area is estimated to be 
around 80 million mu, 5 million mu more than that of last year. 
Its gross output is predicted to have a remarkable increase 
this summer. 
  The production of summer grain crop this year met some 
difficulties. First, owing to the restructuring of crop 
planting, this summer's grain-crops-growing area dropped. 
Second, because of the adjustment of exchange rate of renminbi 
and price rise, prices for the main agricultural production 
materials increased greatly. Third, the weather in early days in 
such crops' growing period was not so good with the accumulated 
temperature in this period being 200 to 300 degrees centigrade 
less than that in past years. 
  Thanks to the strengthening of field management and good 
weather in later days, a good harvest of such crops including 
wheat is guaranteed.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China, made 
up of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, has become the 
largest grain production base in the country, supplying about 
one-third of China's total grain. 
  The northeast China plain, about 16 million hectares of 
fertile land stretching across the three provinces, now provides 
about 25 billion kilograms of grain for the whole nation. It is 
also supplying meat, eggs and milk for about 100 million 
urbanites each year. 
  Over the past four years, the total output of grain has 
reached 50 billion kg each year on average, with the grain 
output last year topping 60 billion kg. The three provinces can 
now release more than half of the grain produced here for 
consumption in other parts of China. 
  The central government used to supply more than one billion 
kg of grain to Liaoning, which is one of the most industrialized 
regions in the country. However, that situation ended two years 
ago. Liaoning Province now offers over one billion tons of grain 
for the nation each year. 
  Experts here said that grain produced in this area has 
played 
a vital role in stabilizing the nation's grain prices since the 
government lifted price control on grain a few years ago. 
  "Grain transported from the northeast to other parts of the 
country greatly eased the grain price hikes in some major cities 
last year as some southern grain-producing provinces witnessed a 
decline in output," said an expert here. 
  Animal husbandry in the region has been growing fast too as 
a 
result of more grain. Last year, meat production topped three 
million tons, making the area self-sufficient in meat supply. 
Extra meat was sold to many other parts of China. 
  The output value of animal husbandry grew to some 30 billion 
yuan, 25 percent of the total farm production value. About one 
million farm households now live on raising livestock. More 
than one-third of the 30 billion kg of corn produced in the 
three provinces were used for raising livestock. 
  Several years ago, there was virtually no animal husbandry 
industry in northeast China because of cold weather and 
traditional means of raising animals. The area was China's 
largest meat-importing region as over 100,000 tons, one-third of 
the meat consumed there, came from other parts of China, 
especially southwest China's Sichuan Province. 
  Officials said the grain output increase was the result of 
years of efforts. Heilongjiang Province has spent 1.6 billion 
yuan in the past few years transforming the lower-productive 
fields. Jilin and Liaoning provinces have spent years 
constructing irrigation projects. 
  Grain output was often affected by natural disasters such as 
early frost. More than 20 items of new technology in 
cultivating grains, including the development of new species, 
the use of plastic film covers, proper application of fertilizer 
and water-saving techniques, were exploited. 
  Experts attribute over 40 percent of the grain output 
increase to the use of new techniques. 
  The three provinces have also increased investment in 
farming 
annually. Jilin Province spent 18.4 billion yuan in the past 
four years on farming, with an annual increase of 11 percent. 
Investment in agriculture in Heilongjiang and Liaoning 
provinces also grew significantly.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Zhang Tiegang: "Why Yeltsin's Visit to </F>
Far East?"] 
  [Text] Moscow, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's three-day working tour of the Russian Far East chiefly 
aimed to curb the Tuva Republic from breaking away from Moscow, 
according to observers here. 
  Soon after his return to Moscow on Thursday [16 June], the 
Russian president said in an exclusive interview with the 
evening "NEWS" program of the Ostankino TV Company that the 
regions he visited became closer to him politically. 
  Yeltsin's trip, started on Tuesday, took him to the far 
eastern cities of Blagoveshchensk, a central city of the Amur 
region and Kyzyl, the capital of the Tuva Republic. On his way 
back to Moscow, he made a brief stop in the Siberian city of 
Novosibirsk on the final day of his tour. 
  At a meeting with Kyzyl leaders, the president offered over 
8 
million U.S. dollars to the Tuva Republic for its economic 
development. 
  Tuva, which joined Russia in 1914, has an area of 170,500 
square kilometers with a population of 300,000. In recent 
years, the republic has shown light tendencies towards 
independence from Moscow. 
  Yeltsin told Tuva leaders that the main economic indicators 
in the republic are worse than the Russian average, and then 
promised them a substantial aid from the federal budget. 
  But he noted that "the republic cannot live by relying only 
on its own resources." 
  He said, "The republic can go through the deep economic 
crisis only by closer cooperation with other regions and joining 
in the inter-regional association called the `Siberian 
Agreement.'" 
  Yeltsin also said that "it is necessary" for the republic to 
develop relations with bordering Mongolia and with China. 
  The Russian leader stressed that efforts should be made to 
implement the two decrees he signed in Tuva to develop the 
economy of the republic. 
  According to the president, the former mistrust between 
Kremlin and the Tuva leadership has disappeared after his trip 
to Far East region.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Cambodian 
Government decided today to expel the representative office of 
the Khmer Rouge from the capital Phnom Penh. 
  Meanwhile, government forces have begun bombing the western 
town of Pailin heralding another major assault on the Khmer 
Rouge stronghold, according to Khmer Rouge sources tonight. 
  Cambodian television has broadcast messages from the 
co-ministers of interior affairs Sar Kheng and You Kockry who 
said that the people of Phnom Penh are "indignant" over the 
failure of the round-table meeting on June 15-16, and indicated 
they would retaliate against the representative office. 
  The government has warned it can no longer guarantee the 
safety of the Khmer Rouge staff in Phnom Penh and recommended 
them to leave before June 19. 
  But it will ensure their safety to the airport if they 
advise 
a departure timetable at least one day before leaving. 
  However, the government stressed that if any staff miss the 
deadline, anything could happen and it will not protect them if 
they are attacked. 
  A spokesman also read out a strongly-worded statement on 
television tonight, denouncing the Khmer Rouge for rejecting a 
ceasefire proposal by King Sihanouk and thus rejecting the will 
of the nation and the people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on speech by Li Zemin, secretary of the </F>
Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, on 6 June; place not known: 
"Step Up Efforts To Crack Down on Major and Grave Economic 
Crimes and Further Deepen the Anticorruption Struggle"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, upon the closing of a telephone 
conference held by the Central Commission on Politics and Law on 
making unrelenting efforts to crack down on major and grave 
economic crimes, Li Zemin, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial 
CPC Committee, set guidelines for party committees at all levels 
in Zhejiang on deepening the anticorruption struggle. He 
stressed: We must further unify our understanding, strengthen 
leadership, ensure a good job of dealing with major and grave 
cases of economic crime, and deepen the anticorruption struggle, 
to maintain the province's trend of reform, development, and 
stability. 
  After noting the considerably good results that Zhejiang has 
achieved in dealing with major and grave cases of economic crime 
since the Second Plenary Meeting of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission in August, Li Zemin pointed out: We 
should not overestimate the results we have achieved -- some 
corrupt practices are far from being effectively checked. Work 
in investigating major and grave cases occurring in key 
departments, especially crimes committed by leading cadres, is 
still a weak link -- it still far falls short of the 
expectations of the party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the masses. 
  Li Zemin said: The guidelines laid down by Comrade Ren 
Jianxin at the telephone conference concerning stepping up 
efforts to crack down on major and grave cases of economic crime 
are important guidelines of the party Central Committee on 
fighting corruption, especially for cracking down on grave 
economic crimes. With the telephone conference as a turning 
point and in conjunction with the relevant guidelines laid down 
by the provincial CPC Committee and government, party 
committees, governments, and public security, procuratorial, and 
judicial departments at all levels of the province should 
faithfully carry out the guidelines set at the telephone 
conference. 
  First, we should further unify our understanding of the 
great 
significance of the anticorruption struggle. Deepening the 
struggle is an important assurance for carrying out the guiding 
principle of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, broaden 
the scope of opening up, accelerate development, and maintain 
social stability," as well as an important effort to strengthen 
party building. We should further clear up the various vague 
ideas about the struggle currently existing among a small number 
of leading cadres, and correct their wrong way of doing things, 
in order to bolster their anticorruption resolve and confidence. 
It should be made clear that anticorruption efforts are an 
important need for the economy to develop smoothly and in a 
healthy manner. We should preserve cadres' enthusiasm and 
initiative in carrying out reform and economic construction, but 
we must never defend or wink at their corrupt and criminal acts. 
Leaders at all levels, especially leading comrades of the party 
and government, should restudy Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
discussion on tightly gripping with two hands and Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's speech at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission; further unify their 
understanding of the great significance of the anticorruption 
struggle; and carry out the struggle unequivocally, justly, and 
forcefully, in order to further deepen the struggle and to 
enable it to endure and yield better results. 
  Second, priority should be given to investigating and 
prosecuting major or serious cases. Vigorous efforts should be 
made to investigate such cases in key departments, especially 
major criminal cases involving leading cadres. Specialized 
organs should follow the mass line by encouraging people to 
report on criminal cases. We should conscientiously do a good 
job in preliminary investigations for clues to solve cases. 
Party committees at various levels should support law- and 
discipline-enforcement departments in preliminary investigations 
of cases. A case that should be investigated and prosecuted 
must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted no matter who is 
involved. We should resolutely resist various personal 
connections and interceding for others. Interference in the 
handling of a case that constitutes a crime should also be 
investigated and prosecuted according to law. We should support 
law-enforcement departments in handling cases independently. We 
should conscientiously implement the principle of dealing 
promptly and severely with serious cases involving economic 
crimes. When it is necessary to make a preliminary 
investigation of a case, we should do so; when a case should be 
put on the record for investigation and prosecution, we should 
do so; and when those involved in a case should be given severe 
sentences, we should also do so. Under the unified leadership 
of party committees, news media and propaganda departments 
should effectively report on and publicize typical major or 
serious cases in order to strengthen people's confidence in the 
struggle against corruption. Conscientiously implementing the 
principle of "being firm, prudent, and accurate," we should 
strictly distinguish between being guilty and being innocent. 
  Third, it is necessary to effectively strengthen our 
leadership over the anticorruption struggle and the 
investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases. The 
anticorruption struggle is a task for the whole party. So the 
whole party should carry it out, and there should be personnel 
responsible for it at every level. We should make unremitting 
efforts to do solid work in this regard. We should 
conscientiously analyze and check on the anticorruption struggle 
according to the central authorities' requirements and the 
conditions of our localities or units. We should make further 
arrangements for the investigation and prosecution of major or 
serious cases, especially cases involving leading cadres. We 
should strengthen our supervision and inspection in this respect 
and vigorously implement relevant policies and measures. We 
should take the initiative in coordinating the investigation and 
prosecution of major or serious cases, especially cases 
involving leading cadres. All departments concerned should make 
concerted efforts in handling such cases. Principal leaders of 
party and government organizations at various levels should 
concern themselves with the investigation and prosecution of 
major or serious cases, support law- and discipline-enforcement 
departments in handling cases according to law, help them remove 
obstructions, and back them to handle cases impartially. It is 
essential to improve law- and discipline-enforcement 
departments' equipment for the investigation of cases and to 
make sure that they have enough funds to handle cases -- 
especially enough funds to investigate and prosecute major cases 
involving leading cadres. 
  Present at the telephone conference were Chai Songyue, 
deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice 
governor of the province; Wang Qichao, standing committee member 
of the provincial party committee and member of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission; Si Daxiao, members of the 
standing committee and secretary of the political and legal 
commission of the provincial party committee; Ge Shengping, 
procurator general of the provincial people's procuratorate; Lu 
Zushan, secretary general of the provincial party committee; and 
leaders of relevant departments.

  [Text] New Delhi, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- The fifth meeting of 
the Sino-Indian joint group on the economy, trade, science, and 
technology opened here today. Both sides exchanged views on 
further developing and expanding Sino-Indian trade. Both sides 
also agreed that there is great potential for economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, and Indian Commerce Minister Mukherjee headed their 
respective delegations at the meeting. 
  Mukherjee said that thanks to their joint efforts and 
compared to 10 years ago, bilateral trade has increased in a 
many-fold way and has scored good results. He pointed out, 
however, that this trade still does not accord with the two 
countries' status. Wu Yi agreed with Mukherjee's views and said 
that the economic and trade cooperation between the two 
countries needs to be further developed. 
  Wu Yi said that both China and India are strong in the area 
of technology. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the 
development of the technology trade. Over the last year, the 
range of bilateral economic and trade cooperation has begun to 
develop from the commodity trade to the technology trade. There 
has been considerable development in the areas of mutual 
investment and technological cooperation. Both sides can take 
advantage of each other's superiority in the areas of 
metallurgy, machinery, and computers. 
  Mukherjee expressed the hope of changing the mode of 
Sino-Indian trade transactions, which used to be mainly 
conducted through a third party. Wu Yi agreed with him on this 
point. 
  This afternoon, Wu Yi and Mukherjee also signed the 1994 
Sino-Indian trade agreement and the minutes of the fifth meeting 
of the Sino-Indian joint group on the economy, trade, science, 
and technology.

<F P=106> [Report: "Jiang Zemin Inspects Zhongshan, Visits Shoe </F>
Factory"] 
  [Text] Chinese President and CPC General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin is now on an inspection tour of Guangdong. In the company 
of Xie Fei, CPC Political Bureau member and Guangdong provincial 
party committee secretary, and of other officials, Jiang Zemin 
arrived in Zhongshan the day before yesterday [16 June]. He met 
with some Taiwan businessmen who were running investment 
projects in the city, and visited a local Taiwan-funded shoe 
factory. This is the second inspection tour of Guangdong by 
Jiang Zemin in the past nine months. 
  A reliable source told this reporter that Jiang Zemin and 
his 
entourage arrived in Guangdong on Wednesday afternoon (15 June). 
After staying in Guangzhou for one night, they left for 
Zhongshan by car on 16 June. On the afternoon of that day, 
Jiang toured the city of Shiqi in the company of local party and 
government officials. After that, he drove to Sanxiang to visit 
the Baolong shoe factory, a local, wholly Taiwan-funded 
investment. 
  According to an informed local source, the Baolong shoe 
factory is the largest wholly Taiwan-funded enterprise so far 
operating in Zhongshan. Employing several thousand workers, the 
factory exports all its products abroad. 
  Having had a brief chat with the Taiwanese hosts in the 
factory's reception room, Jiang Zemin visited two production 
workshops. 
  Jiang Zemin stayed at the Zhongshan Hot Spring Guest House 
the night before last [16 June]. Yesterday morning, he met at 
the guest house with some Taiwan businessmen who are running 
investment projects in Zhongshan, mainly to solicit their 
opinions on the local investment environment. 
  The informed source believed that Jiang Zemin obviously had 
a 
strong motive behind his behavior of particularly highlighting 
his concern about Taiwan-funded enterprises during his current 
inspection tour of Guangdong Province. After the Qiandao Lake 
case, the idea of "independence for Taiwan" has been activated 
daily in Taiwan. The CPC higher leadership's response to this 
development is to increase its economic influence on Taiwan, 
while using the mass media to strongly criticize Li Teng-hui's 
"radical" remarks. In light of their successful experience in 
dealing with the United States regarding the most-favored-nation 
status issue, the CPC higher authorities have made up their 
minds to play the "economic card" with Taiwan. Recently, 
high-ranking CPC officials have paid visits to Taiwan-funded 
enterprises across the country. For instance, Wang Zhaoguo, 
head of the United Front Work Department and director of the 
Taiwan Affairs Office, made an inspection tour of Jiangxi and 
Hubei. Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait, with association Vice Chairman Tang 
Shubei, visited Zhejiang and Jiangsu. All of them assumed a 
"high posture" toward Taiwan businessmen during their inspection 
tours. So it is believed that Jiang Zemin's current visit to 
Guangdong will bring this round of the great united front work 
offensive to a climax. 
  Jiang Zemin last visited Guangdong in late September last 
year. During that inspection tour, he called the party and 
government leaders of the six central-south provinces to meet in 
Guangzhou to solicit their opinions on the macroeconomic 
regulation and control operation. He also went to Zhanjiang to 
inspect the South China Sea Fleet, in his capacity as chairman 
of the Central Military Commission. 
  Apart from the inspection of Taiwan-funded enterprises, 
Jiang 
Zemin's current visit to Guangdong also will focus on state-run 
enterprises and on local scientific and technological 
development. By the way, Zhongshan is one of the cities in 
Guangdong Province selected to run pilot projects under the 
"Torch Program" for the development of science and technology 
sponsored by the State Science and Technology Commission. 
  Like his Shanghai trip earlier and like other leaders' 
visits 
across the country, Jiang Zemin's present tour has another 
purpose: Conducting surveys in preparation for the Fourth 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which is to 
be held later this year. 
  The informed source disclosed that Jiang Zemin originally 
planned to further his inspection tour from Zhongshan to Zhuhai, 
but his plan to visit Zhuhai has been canceled for security 
reasons following a major fire in Zhuhai earlier. His motorcade 
left Zhongshan yesterday and turned northward. It is said that 
he may pay a visit to Foshan and Sanshui, both under the threat 
of flood. A Foshan resident said jokingly: "Jiang Zemin is not 
coming at the right time; perhaps he is bringing the flood along 
with him everywhere in Guangdong."

  [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- Taipei on Friday [17 June] 
responded coolly to Beijing's call for a high-level meeting to 
promote cross-strait dialogue and rapprochement. 
  Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs 
Council, 
told a press conference that "there is no need for Taiwan to 
immediately respond to the mainland's urge to hold high-level 
talks or the fifth round of negotiations...because Taiwan's call 
for special negotiations to work out ways to safeguard Taiwan 
tourists on the mainland has been snubbed by Beijing." 
  "Taiwan on several occasions urged the mainland to talk over 
compensation for the 24 Taiwan tourists killed in March 31's 
Qiandao Lake crime, but ARATS [Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Strait] has yet to respond to our request," Kao said. 
  Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, faxed a message to C.F. Ku, 
president of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on 
Thursday recommending the two meet either in Taipei or a third 
place to tackle cross-strait issues. 
  ARATS again raised the proposal in another fax to the SEF on 
Friday. The two semi-official organizations are authorized by 
their respective governments to handle private exchanges between 
the two sides in the absence of official contacts. 
  Ku and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993 for the first 
time 
to lay a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges. Several agreements 
were signed during the historic meeting. 
  Cross-strait relations have been severely strained due to 
the 
killings.

<F P=106> [By Wing Kay Po] </F>
  [Text] With just 12 days to go before the crucial vote on 
the Governor's electoral reform proposals, Chris Patten and his 
aides have plunged into a frenzy of last-minute lobbying to 
persuade a handful of wavering legislators. 
  Enquiries by Eastern Express show there is an almost equal 
split in the Legislative Council [Legco] between those who 
support Patten and those who support the package of amendments 
-- known as the 1994 package -- sponsored by the Liberal Party 
and some independents co-ordinated by Eric Li. 
  Non-aligned members will be decisive in determining the 
outcome of the vote. 
  A legislator, who did not wish to be identified, said 
yesterday Patten has been personally seeing non-aligned members 
to lobby them to support the electoral reform bill. 
  The lobbying has focused on four appointed members -- Roger 
Luk, Vincent Cheng, Marvin Cheung and Martin Barrow -- who have 
been heavily courted by Patten in the past two days. These four 
legislators are understood to support the 1994 package. Last 
night Roger Luk said he would stand firm on his support for the 
watered down proposals despite lobbying by Patten. Patten is 
believed to have requested breakfast with the group of 
non-aligned legislators to lobby for their support. 
  The Liberal Party and some independent members yesterday 
finalised and submitted their package of amendments to water 
down the government bill which will be debated on June 29. The 
main thrust of these proposals is to retain corporate voting in 
functional constituencies and reduce the size of the electorates. 
  It is estimated that apart from the three government 
officials in Legco, there are 23 legislators in the Democratic 
camp who will vote for the government bill. These include the 
17 United Democrats and Meeting Point members, and independents 
in the Democratic camp, such as Fung Kin-kee, Christine Loh, 
Anna Wu and Jimmy McGregor. 
  Emily Lau, a committed Democrat, is also counted as a 
supporter but she said she was still considering her support as 
she had put in a private member's bill for full direct elections. 
  Lau said there was still a "fighting chance" her bill would 
be passed by Legco. She said she has secured 17 votes. Hui 
Yin-fat is also believed to support Patten's bill. Simon Ip is 
another possible supporter. 
  There are about 23 legislators who would support the 1994 
package. They include the 15 Liberal Party members, and the 
independents Eric Li, Elsie Tu, Samuel Wong, Roger Luk and 
Vincent Cheng. Martin Barrow, Marvin Cheung and Alfred Tso are 
also likely to support it. 
  A legislator who prefers to remain anonymous and who 
supports 
the 1994 package, said there would be at most 31 votes for the 
watered down proposals if pro-China legislators did not abstain. 
Because of the close vote, it is possible neither the 
government bill nor any of the amendments will pass. If so the 
status quo will be maintained. 
  Last night, a senior government official denied allegations 
that the Government is panicking over securing enough votes for 
the reform package. Among the 1994 amendments is a proposal to 
set up a four-part election committee, each comprising 99 
members returning 10 legislators.

Zhang Xiaolin (1728 1420 2657)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 June (XINHUA) -- China will use a Long 
March-III rocket to launch the "Asia-Pacific One" communications 
satellite for the Hong Kong Asia-Pacific Communications 
Satellite Company Ltd [APCSC] in July this year. This will mark 
a new stage in China's international commercial satellite 
launching service. By 2000, China will have launched 30 
satellites for overseas countries or regions. 
  According to a briefing by an official of the China Great 
Wall Industrial Corporation, a number of commercial satellite 
launching contracts are being implemented, and new contracts are 
under negotiation. This year, China will also use Long March-II 
E rockets to launch another satellite, the "Asia-Pacific Two," 
for the APCSC and the (?Plutus) B 3 communications satellite for 
Australia. In 1995 China will launch three satellites for 
overseas clients -- it will use a Long March-II E rocket to 
launch the "Asia Two" communications satellite for the Asia 
Communications Satellite Company Limited; a Long March-III B 
rocket to launch the "International Satellite 7 A," a heavy-duty 
communications satellite, for the International Satellite 
Organization; and a Long March-II E rocket to launch "(?Aicosda) 
One," a high-power, direct- transmission satellite for the 
United States. In 1996 China will use a Long March-IV B rocket 
to launch a resource probing satellite, developed jointly by 
China and Brazil and use a Long March-II E rocket to launch 
"(?Aicosda) Two," a high-power, direct-transmission satellite 
for the United States. After 1996 China will use an improved 
version of the Long March-II C rocket to launch a number of 
low-orbit iridium communications satellites for Motorola 
Corporation of the United States. 
  The China Great Wall Industrial Corporation official said: 
China's commercial satellite launching service and cooperation 
in the manufacture of satellites constitute a useful supplement 
to the international market, and also provide a new choice for 
international satellite clients. This is also a responsibility 
and obligation China should undertake for the peaceful 
development and utilization of outer space resources.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052)] </F>
  [Text] Nanjing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- While inspecting rural 
areas in Suzhou recently, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the 
Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC 
Central Committee, stressed that economically developed areas 
should further strengthen their agricultural foundation and 
bring about an all-around development of the rural economy; they 
should intensify the building of a socialist spiritual 
civilization and bring about all-around social progress. 
  From 11 to 15 June, Wen Jiabao conducted investigations and 
studies in Suzhou's Wujiang, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, 
Zhangjiagang, and Taicang Counties (cities) to become acquainted 
with the development of agriculture and the rural economy there. 
Suzhou made an early start in building town and township 
enterprises, and they have been developing rapidly. By the end 
of 1993, the city's town and township enterprises, whose output 
value accounted for 75 percent of the city's total industrial 
output value, employed 45 percent of the rural labor force. 
While rapidly expanding town and township enterprises, the city 
authorities have not slackened agriculture, investing more than 
300 million yuan in agriculture each year. All throughout the 
countryside, the rural economy is flourishing; production is 
expanding; and there is social stability. After fully affirming 
Suzhou city's marked achievements in economic and social 
development, Wen Jiabao said: Town and township enterprises are 
a great invention of China's peasants and are also the pillar 
for economic development in the countryside. From the very 
start, town and township enterprises have been closely linked 
to the rural economy, to agricultural modernization, and to 
efforts by peasants to strive for a prosperous standard of 
living. Vigorously developing town and township enterprises is 
an important mission for rural economic work. Areas with 
comparatively developed town and township enterprises should, 
through supplementing agriculture with industry and developing 
agricultural with support from industry, make further efforts to 
strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy and 
comprehensively invigorate the rural economy by ensuring that 
grain production, diversified undertakings, and town and 
township enterprises develop in a coordinated way. 
  Visiting a number of township-established high-standard 
farms 
and vegetable growing bases, Wen Jiabao asked many relevant 
questions. He said: Establishment of high-standard capital 
farms and vegetable growing bases will spur the construction of 
agricultural infrastructural facilities and the construction of 
agricultural service systems, and the application of modern 
agricultural science and technology will also help in protecting 
arable land. Areas with a comparatively developed economy 
should strengthen the coonstruction of high-standard 
agricultural farms and protected zones for vegetable gardens. 
When conditions permit, all areas should develop diversified 
undertakings of an appropriate scale in line with local 
conditions and strive to increase the level of intensive farming. 
  While seizing the opportunity to accelerate economic 
development, Suzhou has also paid attention to the building of a 
spiritual civilization in rural areas. Education, culture, and 
health services have developed fairly rapidly there, and public 
order has been relatively good. After commending the local 
authorities for what they had done, Wen Jiabao stressed: What 
we want to build is a new socialist countryside with developed 
material and spiritual civilizations. While we should strive to 
enable the peasants to have ample food and clothing and enjoy a 
fairly prosperous material life, we should also strive to enable 
them to work and live in peace and contentment and to enjoy a 
relatively abundant spiritual life. In rural work, we should 
adhere to the principle that both material progress and cultural 
and ideological progress should be promoted, and concentrate on 
the objectives of developing the rural productive forces and 
achieving a comfortable standard of living. While deepening 
reform and developing the economy, we should effectively 
strengthen the building of a spiritual civilization in rural 
areas, bring about all-around progress there, and strive to 
build a prosperous and civilized new socialist countryside. 
  Accompanying Wen Jiabao on the inspection tour were Cao 
Hongming, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC 
Committee; Wang Minsheng, vice chairman of the provincial 
people's congress standing committee secretary of the Suzhou 
City party committee; and others.

<F P=106> [By Jackie Horne in London] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese government, in a move likely to stun the 
Asian banking community, is believed to have drawn up a third 
list of about 50 state enterprises that it wants to seek 
listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. 
  Speculation concerning such a list, which according to a 
high-ranking, Shanghai-based official will be made public in 
full at the end of the year, may heighten frequently expressed 
concerns about the level of fund-raising by Chinese companies 
over the next 12 months. 
  The current batch of 22 Chinese enterprises is in the 
process 
of listing offshore are hoping to raise about HK$8 billion, in 
the face of an increasingly bearish international investment 
community. 
  Such an ambitious number of companies slated for 
international flotation will also call into question the Chinese 
government's ongoing efforts to develop its domestic stock 
markets to their full potential. 
  Although plans have been announced to double the number of 
listed B shares by the end of the year, expanding market 
capitalisation by a further U.S.$2 billion (HK$15.6 billion) 
with a string of mainly infrastructure-related listings, 
international investors will have even less reason to shift 
their focus from the rapidly expanding H share market, 
especially while there remains no securities law in China. 
  The continual flow of new listings (nearly 2.5 billion new 
shares have come on to the Shanghai bourse during the first half 
of this year) has also been said to be one of the main causes 
behind the collapse of confidence at both the Shenzhen and 
Shanghai exchanges. 
  The fallout reached a new low point on Monday, when the 
Shanghai A share market fell below 500 points for the first time 
in more than a year and the foreign investor-driven B share 
market dropped to 71.13 points. 
  In Hong Kong, on the other hand a Peregrine-led offering of 
186 million shares for China Pharmaceutical was an encouraging 
three times oversubscribed by the time it closed this week. 
  Investment bankers said that the varying fortunes of 
China-related companies trading in Hong Kong reflected 
increasingly sophisticated investor appraisals of individual 
companies. 
  Shares in Dongfang Electric, the last of the original nine 
companies to be listed outside China, have traded up to a 12 per 
cent premium over the listing price last week. Its less well 
received predecessor, Tianjin Bohai, continued to languish at a 
discount. 
  Bankers are also wary about the impending flotation of the 
first company from the new batch of 22 intended overseas 
listings, Luoyang Glass, which is due for launch next week. 
  "Sentiment is not that great," banker said. 
  "At the US roadshows, investors asked quite searching 
questions and didn't get very consistent answers," he said. 
  Luoyang is being pitched at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13 
but many believe that it will come to the market at a softened 
level of 10 or 11. 
  With between $912.5 million and $1.2 billion being raised in 
total, about 25 to 30 per cent would be raised in Hong Kong. 
The international issue will be in the form of American 
Depository Receipts listed on the Nasdaq system.

<F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Zhu Chengxiu (2612 2110 </F>
0208): "On Li Denghui's Certain Remarks"] 
  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- This year, Mr. Li 
Denghui [Li Teng-hui], the preeminent power-holder of the Taiwan 
authorities, has made a great deal of unusual remarks inside and 
outside the island of Taiwan, and these remarks have quite 
flagrantly betrayed his inclination toward "Taiwan 
independence." This has triggered serious concern at home and 
abroad. People commonly maintain it is imperative to keep a 
close watch on Li Denghui's moves from now on and also refute 
his strange talk and comments. 
  Some of Li Denghui's remarks were blatant, and some were 
ambiguous; and more often than not they were self-contradictory 
and logically confusing. Moreover, soon after he made certain 
mind-boggling remarks, he would amend them to alleviate 
questioning by the media. But whenever there was an 
opportunity, he would give a different explanation. Despite his 
changeability, he was helplessly "revealing his true intenis 
true." What, then, is Mr. Li Denghui's true intent? 
  People may have discovered that, within the island of 
Taiwan, 
Mr. Li Denghui has disseminated the seed of discord by 
occasionally provoking contradictions between Taiwanese people 
and those from the mainland. On cross-strait relations, he has 
denied that there is but one China, thus separating Taiwan from 
the mainland and pitting Taiwan against the mainland. He has 
also, time and again, been wantonly critical of the CPC, and the 
language he has used has been so vile that it appeared he had 
lost his head. In this way he has exposed himself step by step. 
  Among Li Denghui's pronouncements is the demagogic phrase 
of "the sorrows of being born a Taiwanese." Whenever he uses 
this phrase, he invariably makes reference to "Exodus" in the 
Bible. In other words, he is distressed by the invasions and 
suffering in the history of Taiwan and it is his ambition to 
lead the Taiwanese in building a new nation. What Li Denghui 
tries to do here is to separate Taiwan from China, and Taiwanese 
from Chinese. Yes, the corrupt government in the later years of 
the Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan following the 1894-95 
Sino-Japanese War, and the Taiwanese people suffered enslavement 
for half a century. That episode of history is, however, a 
tragic chapter for China and the Chinese nation as a whole. 
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the concessions in Shanghai and 
other parts of China are all symbols of the tragic fate of China 
due to aggression by the big powers, a Chinese nation in 
humiliation. For many long years people on both sides of the 
strait suffered, and their sufferings were those of the Chinese 
nation as a whole. It should also be pointed out that from the 
day the Qing Government decided to cede Taiwan, Taiwanese, one 
stepping into the breach as another fell, fought and laid down 
their lives in their struggle against the ceding and the 
aggression of Japanese imperialism. Numerous national heroes 
emerged among the Taiwanese. Their wish that Taiwan be returned 
to China was realized 50 years later after the Chinese people 
fought eight years of bloody war. Although all their struggles 
ended in failure, their heroism will be immortalized in history. 
How could Li Denghui, who prates about "the sorrows of being a 
Taiwanese" and "Exodus" and claims to be most knowledgeable 
about modern Chinese history, be so ignorant of the history of 
his own country? 
  We must also point out that only a unified and strong China 
can prevent tragedy from falling on the Chinese people. Being 
born a Taiwanese is being born a Chinese. Only by working for 
the great cause of motherland reunification will we be able to 
prevent the historical tragedy from repeating itself. We are 
convinced that Taiwan compatriots will, instead of being swayed 
by Li Denghui's demagogy, obtain a more profound understanding 
of this. 
  Li Denghui claimed that cross-strait relations should not 
develop into a relationship between father and son but into a 
relationship between brother and brother. He also asserted that 
the inclusion of Taiwan as a province of the People's Republic 
of China by the CPC constitutes a "strange dream," adding 
"Taiwan and the mainland are under different governments. This 
is all I can say." This is another ill-intentioned attempt by 
him to sow discord among and incite the compatriots in Taiwan 
regarding cross-strait relations. This is him trying to confuse 
people about cross-strait relations. It should be said that the 
people of both sides of the strait are kinsfolk to each other; 
as far as the country is concerned, both sides of the strait are 
one entity, each forming a part of China. Like 30 other 
provincial-level administrative regions of China, Taiwan is also 
a provincial-level administrative region. In the future there 
will be Hong Kong and Macao. All these provincial-level 
administrative regions form the great People's Republic of 
China. How can one distinguish between father and son in a 
unified body? Moreover, when the two sides of the strait are 
reunified peacefully in the future, it will not be one side 
swallowing up the other side or vice versa; Taiwan will become a 
province or a provincial-level special administrative region of 
the People's Republic of China; the central government will 
reserve a certain number of leading positions for Taiwan. As 
for the question of "different governments," we have always 
advocated one country, two systems. When peaceful reunification 
is achieved in the future, Taiwan can practice a system 
different from that on the mainland. Taiwan's party, government, 
and military will be managed by Taiwan itself. These policies 
of ours were made known to the world long ago. They cannot be 
obliterated by a few ambiguous utterances by Mr. Li Denghui. 
However, this does in no way mean that China is permitting the 
promotion of two political entities of equal standing. If Mr. 
Li Denghui stubbornly clings to his aim of a political entity of 
equal standing, he is dreaming of something strange, but when he 
wakes up he will find that everything is empty. Mr. Li Denghui 
should know this. 
  Recently Li Denghui also hawked the so-called "Republic of 
China on Taiwan" everywhere in an attempt to use these ambiguous 
words to create "two Chinas" internationally, and to stand up to 
the People's Republic of China as an equal. His attempt will be 
doomed to run into a wall. Interestingly, he, despite flaunting 
the signboard of "the Republic of China," does not take great 
interest in "the Republic of China" and claimed that it is "a 
regime from the outside." The fact that he does not value the 
general interests of the Chinese nation above everything else 
makes Mr. Li Denghui a very confused person. 
  Lately, sovereignty also has become one of the pet topics of 
Li Denghui. At one time he would say "sovereignty is a 
dangerous word." At another time he would toy with such pretty 
slogans as "sovereignty rests with the people." He scolded the 
Communist Chinese, saying "they lack the qualification to talk 
about sovereignty." Recently he changed his mind, saying that 
it would be better not to talk about the issue of sovereignty 
and that mainland leaders "are ossified." The whole thing is 
deadlocked over the issue of "sovereignty rests with the people 
and let's set aside the problem of sovereignty for the moment." 
His babblings are just mind-boggling. Very few people in the 
world can understand why "sovereignty" is "a dangerous word," 
because all they know is that sovereignty is sacred and 
inviolable. As regards Li Denghui's so- called "sovereignty 
rests with the people," this is nothing but his attempt to make 
use of an empty concept to evade the issue of who owns the 
sovereignty of Taiwan. "Let's set aside the issue of 
sovereignty for the moment" is another stalling tactic to gain 
time. Li Denghui's aim, in the final analysis, is to split 
Taiwan away from China. But, to borrow Mr. Li Denghui's own 
words: It is nothing but babblings in dreams. 
  Li Denghui has repeatedly emphasized the present divide and 
separate rule on both sides of the strait. He failed to speak 
about the historical reasons which lead to this situation. He 
refrained from speaking on the efforts needed to achieve 
reunification. Therefore, people cannot help thinking that he is 
trying to fan up a separation consciousness from that side of 
the strait. There is a saying that to judge a person, one needs 
not only to listen to his remarks but also to observe his deeds. 
Mr. Li Denghui is just the sort of person who is obsessed with 
his own small calculations. 
  On several occasions this year, Li Denghui has let loose a 
torrent of abuse against the Chinese Communists. His muddle 
headedness has even surprised the people on the island. Because 
the Chinese Communists did not deem to heed his curses, he 
became so conceited that he even said, "When I get tough, the 
other side blinks." People are simply amazed at the degree of 
his lack of self-knowledge. He also repeatedly claimed that 
before he reached the age of 22 (that is in 1945, before the 
retrocession of Taiwan to China) he had been a Japanese. If one 
understands that he is not ashamed of, but even proud of his 
country being conquered by Japan, then it will be easy to 
understand on what kind of ideological basis he has based his 
various fallacies of today. Of course, what makes the people 
most concerned now is how far this person, with such an 
ideological basis, will go on the erroneous path.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Yesterday, the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and 
ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei separately sent 
letters to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and SEF 
Vice Chairman Jiao Renhe, suggesting that arrangements be made 
for holding talks between persons in charge of the ARATS and the 
SEF and between their deputy secretaries and for holding 
department director-level talks. 
  The letter sent by ARATS to SEF noted: After the talks 
between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF ended in 
Beijing in February this year, compatriots on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait affirmed their efforts and optimistically 
anticipated the fourth routine meeting would yield positive 
results. However, the fourth routine meeting failed to achieve 
the anticipated objective. We sincerely feel it is necessary 
for the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF to hold talks to 
facilitate the ironing out of differences at an early date, to 
strive for the conclusion of three agreements, including the 
agreement on the "Repatriation of Personnel Who Have Entered 
Into the Region of the Other Side in Violation of Relevant 
Regulations and Other Related Issues," to discuss other topics 
on the agenda as soon as possible, and to expedite ARATS-SEF 
affairs. According to the "Agreement on ARATS-SEF Contacts and 
the System for Their Talks," the dates for the biannual talks 
between the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF, the 
quarterly meeting between their deputy secretaries general, and 
the quarterly department director-level meeting between ARATS 
and the SEF will be due soon. We suggest that arrangements be 
made for the above-mentioned talks and meetings to be held at 
the same time. We would like to have your opinion on the above. 
  Tang Shubei's letter to Jiao Renhe noted: After the persons 
in charge of ARATS and the SEF ended their talks in Beijing in 
February this year, agreements should have been reached as 
quickly as possible on the basis of the high degree of consensus 
reached during the February Beijing talks, and according to the 
"Joint News Draft." However, the fourth routine meeting 
encountered various difficulties and failed to achieve the 
anticipated objective. Under the circumstances, press circles 
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait believed it is necessary for 
the persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF to hold talks. 
According to the "Agreement on ARATS-SEF Contacts and the 
System for Their Talks," the dates for meetings between the 
persons in charge of ARATS and the SEF, and between their deputy 
secretaries general will be due soon. I am afraid both you and 
I will have to make efforts again to successfully fulfill our 
tasks and to continue to promote ARATS-SEF cooperation as well 
as the achievement of results in cross-strait relations.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the mainland 
suggested in a letter to the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) Friday [17 June] to hold further talks between 
the two organizations soon. 
  The letter said that ARATS hopes the negotiations will help 
resolve disputes at an early date and help them to finalize 
three other agreements, including one involving the repatriation 
of people who entered the other side through illegal means. 
  The fourth business-like negotiations, which were held 
earlier this year, did not reach expected results due to various 
factors, said the letter. 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice-chairman of ARATS, said in a 
separate letter to Chiao Jen Ho [Jiao Renhe], vice-chairman of 
SEF, that he hopes both Jiao and he would make joint efforts to 
help promote cooperation between the two organizations and 
improve relations across the Taiwan Straits. 
  The letter said that in accordance with agreements reached 
earlier, the time to hold the bi-annual meeting between 
officials in charge of the two organizations and the quarterly

  [Text] According to the provincial flood control 
headquarters, yesterday the flood peak appeared in the middle 
and lower reaches of the Xiang Jiang, arriving at Changsha at 
1400, where the water level rose to 39 meters -- 65 centimeters 
higher than the highest level ever reported. Due to their 
height and magnitude, the flood waters exceeded the flood 
control project's capability to withstand the resulting strain, 
and Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Changsha suffered serious 
losses. According to yesterday's statistics, embankments 
collapsed in 66 places along the Xiang Jiang, submerging 
approximately 450,000 mu of land. Flood waters broke through 
the western embankment of the Xiang Jiang in Changsha at 1100 
yesterday, creating a 50-meter hole and submerging seven 
villages, 300,000 mu of land, and some universities and colleges 
in Yuelu Township, causing at least 100 million yuan in direct 
economic losses. The whereabouts of some people remain unknown. 
After the disaster occurred, party, government, and Army 
leaders at all levels went to the front lines of the 
flood-fighting effort and organized and guided flood fighting 
and relief work. 
  The province has sent more than 100,000 cadres and 2 million 
people to fight the floods. Yesterday afternoon, the provincial 
flood control headquarters once again created an emergency plan 
to utilize every available means to meet the flood peak head-on. 
Troops stationed in Hunan have dispatched personnel from four 
battalions to Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, and Changsha to do 
relief work and move people stranded by the floods to secure 
areas. Armed police and public security police officers and men 
are using all their strength to plunge into the work of fighting 
the floods and distributing relief. 
  The provincial party committee and government urged the 
broad 
masses of cadres and people in the Xiang Jiang basin and Army 
personnel and civilians across the province to put the general 
interest ahead of everything else, fight in unity, and strive to 
overcome the catastrophic flooding of the Xiang Jiang. The 
low-lying areas along the banks of the Xiang Jiang, which cannot 
fight the floods, must try their best to relocate people and 
ensure their safety.

  [Text] Changsha, June 19 (XINHUA) -- This capital of 
central China's Hunan province has been hit by floods in the 
wake of a succession of rainstorms on the upper and middle 
reaches of the Xiangjiang River. 
  The water level of the river, which flows through Changsha, 
is still rising sharply, according to local sources. 
  By four o'clock this afternoon the level recorded at the 
Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 m, some 0.56 m 
higher than the highest figure ever previously recorded. The 
flood has caused serious losses to people along both banks of 
the river, especially in Changsha, according to the sources. 
  In the early hours of yesterday six villages and one fishing 
ground at Yulushan township were flooded when an embankment 
collapsed. 
  Most of the 15,000 people affected by the flood there have 
been evacuated to safer places. 
  By six o'clock yesterday afternoon 19 dykes in the Changsha 
area had collapsed, and a total of 128,000 urban and rural 
residents had been affected. 
  A partial collapse of the grand Longwangang embankment at 
the 
Xihu fishing ground in the Wangyuehu district of Changsha has 
put the lives and property of 60,000 people in danger. 
  But thanks to the concerted rescue efforts of 2,000 local 
cadres, residents and soldiers there was no loss of life. 
  The city government of Changsha has asked residents within 
the endangered areas to relocate themselves and remove their 
property to safer places, in case of the occurrence of more 
serious flooding. 
  By the early hours of this morning roads and surfaces of 
bridges in the Wangyuehu district had been inundated. The flood 
waters had also reached the boulevard along the Xiangjiang 
River, Xiahe Street and the western part of Zhongshan Street in 
Changsha proper. 
  So far, more than 500,000 soldiers and local residents have 
moved in to help fight the floods. 
  Meanwhile, the Changsha city committee of the Communist 
Party 
has held an emergency meeting, urging all departments and the 
people of the whole city to carry forward the spirit of 
continuous fighting and unite as one in battling the floods. 
  Wang Maolin, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party 
Committee, who is now in the province's southern city of Zhuzhou 
to direct anti-flood efforts there. In a telephone call to the 
Changsha city government, he called on local officials to adopt 
effective measures, ensure the safety of the lives and property 
of the residents of Changsha and make an overall success of the 
work to conquer the flood.

Chinese provinces has claimed 438 lives in the past 12 days and 
left another 6,470 injured, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said 
Monday [20 June]. Releasing provisional figures, the ministry 
said more than 48 million people had been affected by flooding, 
with 482,000 homes destroyed and three million hectares (7.4 
million acres) of farmland under water. 
  Hardest hit was Guangdong province, with 134 dead and 52

  [Text] Qingyuan, June 20 (CNS) -- The worst damage was 
caused by an extraordinarily serious flood in Qingyuan, a city 
in Guangdong Province, in the last 100 years. Initial 
statistics showed that at least 87 persons died because of 
floods and the direct economic loss was over RMB 1.3 billion 
[renminbi] as of today. 
  Nearly half of the population of 3.5 million were affected 
by 
the natural disaster. An official report said that most of the 
death toll might be registered in Qingyuan's Liannan County, in 
which at least 42 persons died and 22 were missing. Most of the 
dead were young persons who were either drowned or swept away by 
floods. There were at least 110,000 homes destroyed and 16,000 
houses collapsed. The homeless across the city was put at over 
10,000 persons, and there were up to 6,000 persons homeless in 
Fogang County alone in northern part of the city. 
  About 80,000 hectares of crops were flooded across Qingyuan 
and large pieces of paddy-fields coming near to a harvest were 
destroyed. One third of 150,000 mu of paddy-fields in Qingxin 
County was flooded, according to a local official. 
  Quite a lot of trunk roads which were put at 459 and at 
least 
two bridges were damaged by violent floods. A 16-kilometre 
section of a provincial grade road was flooded while 6-kilometre 
long part of road was seriously destroyed which caused a damage 
of over RMB 40 million [renminbi]. Traffic across the city was 
paralyzed. As there were many areas across the city with 
breakdown of traffic and communications, it is estimated that 
the death toll and damage would climb up. 
  In Wuzhou of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the flood 
peak topped the water level of 25.91 metres, exceeding the 
warning level by 10.91 metres. The flowing rate was put at 
46,200 cubic metres per second, registering the greatest flood 
since 1949. Wuzhou and its suburban areas were flooded to a 
certain extent. Most of the outbound traffic and communications 
broke down. It is in a critical state in the Pearl River Delta 
area in which flood control is in great urgency. 
  In Hunan Province, Hengyang, Xiangtan and Changsha cities 
underwent the highest flood peak the day before yesterday since 
1949. Eight cities along the Yangtze River covering 128 towns 
were flooded. 
  The State Council sent working teams from the Ministry of 
Water Resources, the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry 
of Civil Affairs to rush to Guangxi and Guangdong to help fight 
floods.

  [Text] The flood peak has already passed through the Bei 
Jiang, and the vast area surrounding the river is safe and 
sound. This morning, the Bei Jiang Flood-Fighting Headquarters 
arranged the work for the post-flood period. The following is a 
report just sent back by this station's reporter on the Bei 
Jiang front: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] This morning, 
Guangdong Province's Bei Jiang Flood-Fighting Headquarters held 
a series of meetings to arrange flood-fighting work after the 
flood peak had passed. Commander in Chief Ou Guangyuan [also 
vice governor] demanded that the leaders of various branches 
maintain a high degree of alertness, prepare work well, and 
guard against slacking off and becoming careless. He stressed 
that dams often collapse not when the river is rising but when 
it drops, and that each shift must be strengthened to detect 
problems promptly. He said: It is unlikely that the flood will 
pull down the main dam; it would be worse if we were slow to 
discover a dangerous situation. He demanded that, before the 
water drops to safe levels, there must be round-the-clock 
patrols, no one must slack off, and flood-fighting materials 
must be further supplied to various positions. Ou Guangyuan said 
earnestly that the work has touched the hearts of the central 
leaders, the provincial and city leaders, and the cadres and 
people throughout the province. He added that, due to their 
unique importance, we must ensure that the areas along the Bei 
Jiang and Guangzhou City remain perfectly safe. This is a 
report from Guangdong Radio's reporting team on the front of the 
battle against the flood in the Bei Jiang. [end recording] 
  According to Guangdong Radio's reporting team on the Bei 
Jiang front of the flood battle, the State Council's joint 
relief work team arrived at the Bei Jiang this morning to give 
instructions on fighting the flood and providing relief. The 
work team spoke highly of the Guangdong people's high degree of 
alertness against the flood and their skill in combating natural 
disasters. It also pointed out that the flood peak had only 
just passed through the Bei Jiang, that a difficult battle 
remained to be fought, and that the water level was still high 
and a high degree of alertness must be maintained to strive for 
overall victory in the battle against the flood in the Bei 
Jiang. The work team today arrived at (Shi Qiao), (Xia Lin 
Zhou), and other dangerous areas to inspect the flood prevention 
work. Its members said: Guangdong has done a great deal of 
work in flood prevention and relief and has an admirable ability 
to resist natural disasters. The leaders at various levels pay 
attention to work and give sensible orders, and the people's 
minds are at ease. From the party, the government, and the 
military down to the ordinary people, everyone has pulled 
together to fight the greatest flood in 50 years. Had it not 
been a contingent with such a high degree of awareness about 
fighting floods, such a great flood would have submerged many 
areas. At present, the flood peak has just passed safely, and 
this can be considered a victory. The water level is still 
high, and the typhoon season will come in July and August; 
therefore, Guangdong must maintain its high degree of awareness, 
must not slack off or become careless, and must continue to 
prepare materials for fighting floods, so as to achieve an 
overall victory in relief work and in the fight against the 
flood in the Bei Jiang.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporters Lin Ning (2651 1337) </F>
and Ye Hongyan (0673 4767 3601): "500,000 People Fight Floods 
in Guangdong"] 
  [Text] Lubao, 19 June -- Guangdong's Bei Jiang dike today 
has resisted the worst floods in 50 years, but the situation 
remains critical. Accompanied by Zhang Guoying, deputy 
secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, General Li 
Xilin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, and those in 
charge of the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Air Force in 
Guangzhou, inspected the water situation at the Bei Jiang dike 
this afternoon along the section between Sanshui's Huangtang, 
Lubao, and Datang and Qingyuan's Shilan. They conveyed 
greetings to the more than 1,400 officers and men combating 
floods at the forefront. 
  The whole length of the Bei Jiang dike currently is standing 
the test of the highest water level on record. The water level 
throughout the river valley is not expected to drop appreciably 
over the next few days and the flood peak has entered the Bei 
Jiang dike area. This, plus the rising water level in the Xi 
Jiang, means the high water level will last for some time. This 
will still pose a major threat to the safety of the earthen 
dike. Moreover, the weather may worsen, and work is under way 
to strengthen the dangerous section of the dike, but the 
situation of the dike foundation, which has a high degree of 
water penetration, is even more grim. 
  Early this morning and in the daytime, the water situation 
in 
Bei Jiang was most critical. At 0300, 0800, 1000, 1400, and 
1500 today, the water levels at the Bei Jiang dike measured at 
Qingyuan, Shijiao, Lubao, Datang, and Huangtang stations all 
were higher than the highest figures ever recorded in the past 
50 years. After that, the water level at various sections 
dropped slightly, but rose again quickly after 1800. By 2200 
today, the water levels at the five stations rose again, 
reaching 16.34, 14.80, 12.46, 13.94, and 11.93 meters, 
respectively, higher by 10-20 cm than the highest figures ever 
recorded in the past 50 years. 
  According to Ou Guangyuan, head of the flood-control 
headquarters at the Bei Jiang dike, the water situation tonight 
and tomorrow will be very critical because the water level at 
the Bei Jiang dike will reach the highest point tonight. 
Afterward, it will drop slowly. The Xi Jiang floods also will 
reach the highest point tomorrow. The simultaneous rise of 
water in the two rivers will keep the water level high for 6-8 
days. The time between now and 26 June is a tide-flowing 
period. Having been subject to the high water level pressure 
for a long time, the Bei Jiang dike will face a test. 
  Until now, there have been no major breaches of the Bei 
Jiang 
dike, but owing to the loose soil at the dike's base, there have 
been leaks and gushes of water in scores of places. Both early 
this morning and in the daytime today, the most critical 
situation happened in Shijiao, where there were many leaks along 
the 16-km dike. There were 17 leaks in a single 3-km section. 
Some 300 soldiers have been dispatched to the scene to plug 
holes with sandy soil and stone. In the evening, a serious leak 
occurred in the Shijiao-Xialingzhou section, to which Ou 
Guangyuan hastily dispatched 900 soldiers to deal with the 
emergency. 
  According to statistics from Zhaoqing, Qingyuan, Shaoguan, 
Foshan, Jiangmen, and the Bei Jiang dike, the number of people 
taking part in controlling floods and dealing with emergencies 
has reached 506,000. At 0400 today, the Guangdong Provincial 
CPC Committee and provincial government delivered 100 tonnes of 
biscuits and 100,000 bottles of mineral water to Yingde to be 
airdropped by the air force to the 70,000-plus victims who are 
still trapped by the floods in that area. 
  In dealing with the worst flood in 50 years, Guangdong has 
received vigorous support and help from the Guangzhou Military 
Region. The support troops have energetically organized people 
to inspect dikes, watch the water situation, enforce dikes, 
repair roads, and plug leaks and holes in dikes. 
  At 1400 today, accompanied by Zhang Guoying, deputy 
secretary 
of the provincial party committee; vice governor Ou Guangyuan; 
and Major General Yu Lusheng, head of the Army flood-control 
headquarters at the Bei Jiang dike and deputy commander of the 
provincial military district; General Li Xinlin, commander of 
the Guangzhou Military Region; along with Lieutenant General 
Yang Zhengang of the Guangzhou Air Force; Major General Gong 
Gucheng, chief of staff of the Guangzhou Military Region; 
political department director Major General Lei Mingqiu; 
logistics department director Major General Chen Tianlin; Major 
General Liu Yuanjie, political commissar of the Guangdong 
Military District; Rear Admiral Zhang Zhensheng, commander of 
the Guangzhou Naval Base; and Rear Admiral Li Xingguo, political 
commissar of the Guangzhou Naval Vessels Academy; visited the 
commanders and fighters of the troops protecting the Bei Jiang 
dike. General Li said: The 30,000-plus officers and men of the 
Guangzhou Military Region are standing in readiness for orders 
to go to the dike at any time to deal with emergencies and 
combat floods. 
  This afternoon, on behalf of Xie Fei, member of the 
Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Guangdong Governor Zhu 
Senlin, Deputy Secretary Zhang Guoying extended greetings to the 
5,000-plus officers and men at the forefront of combating floods 
and dealing with emergencies.

  [Text] The remains of a six-storey factory in Zhuhai which 
collapsed last week were blown up yesterday, despite fears 20 
people were trapped in an adjacent pile of rubble. Zhuhai 
authorities said the demolition was to prevent further accidents. 
  The official death toll from the collapse rose to 38 when 
another 14 bodies were plucked from the three-storey debris. 
The number of injured in Zhuhai's worst industrial accident 
stood at "more than 160". A government spokesman said the 
rescue would continue but was getting more difficult". 
  Fire swept through the Yu Xin Textile Factory in Qianshan on 
Thursday and the front half of the building caved in the 
following day after torrential rain. 
  Two hundred workers were inside, having been ordered back by 
their joint venture Hong Kong bosses to retrieve the cotton 
stock. 
  After nearly four days of digging, Zhuhai authorities 
decided 
yesterday to use explosives to demolish the remaining half, 
fearing it could collapse. 
  The explosion was set off at 5.20 pm, 75 hours after workers 
were buried. The walls cracked and the building folded in the 
centre and disappeared in a cloud of dust. 
  Public Security Bureau officers and the People's Liberation 
Army sealed off a 500-metre area and city authorities declared a 
news blackout on the operation. 
  A group of 20 Hong Kong and Macao journalists and 
photographers hid behind bushes about 300 metres from the scene 
for more than two hours, but were discovered by a soldier and 
expelled minutes before the explosion. Their film was 
confiscated. 
  Hong Kong unionists last night criticised the authorities 
for 
ending hopes of survivors. Winnie Tam Pik-yan, executive 
secretary of the 130,000-strong Hong Kong Confederation of Trade 
Unions, said: "My God, how come the Government did that? How 
about those still trapped?" 
  "There may be people waiting for help. Although the chance 
of their survival gets smaller as time goes by, no one can deny 
them the chance." 
  The Government should have waited at least a week before 
blowing up the part of the factory still standing, she said. 
  Zhuhai officials said the explosion was "directional" and 
would not affect the rubble where the missing workers were. An 
official said bulldozers and heavy machinery would be brought in 
today to remove debris. 
  Earlier, Zhuhai Municipal Government spokesman Yang 
Shuisheng 
said "about 20" workers were missing, but the chances of anyone 
being alive were slim. The Government allowed relatives of the 
dead mainly migrant workers from rural areas -- to identify 
remains at the crematorium. Fourteen bodies were identified. 
  Most of the relatives were angry that the management had 
sent 
workers back into the damaged factory. Some shouted abuse and 
gestured at management staff. 
  Relatives discussed compensation with the management but no 
announcement was made.

  [Text] Hefei, June 21 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province is rapidly boosting its foreign trade in technology. 
  The provincial technology import and export company 
concluded 
a transaction volume totalling 52.677 million U.S. dollars-worth 
in the first five months of this year, an increase of 41.53 
percent over the same period of last year. 
  A company official attributed the good result to the 
improvement of service and trading methods, and the expansion of 
export-oriented business. 
  According to the official, the company has helped a number 
of 
key industries, including the light and textile industries, 
machinery, electronics, chemicals, telecommunications, tobacco, 
metallurgy and raw materials, to upgrade their technology. 
  The company has rearranged its product mix to export 
high-tech products and relatively advanced technology items over 
the past few years. 
  Meanwhile, it has set up enterprises and offices in the 
United States, Canada, South Africa and Australia, and has 
forged foreign trade relations with 132 countries and regions.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Fujian Girds for Economic Takeoff"] </F>
  [Text] Fujian, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Fujian, a southeast 
Chinese province with a booming economy, is gearing up for an 
economic takeoff by greatly improving its infrastructure. 
  According to Zhang Jiakun, deputy governor of the province, 
Fujian plans to pour 300 billion yuan (about 34 billion U.S. 
dollars) in the upcoming six years into the construction of such 
infrastructure projects as airports, harbors, railways, highway, 
telecommunications and power plants. 
  In addition, the province is to push ahead with reforms of 
the systems of banking, finance and foreign currency exchange, 
and simplify the procedures for foreign investment so as to 
attract more investment from overseas. 
  Situated on China's southeast coast facing Taiwan across the 
Taiwan straits, Fujian is the ancestral home of eight million 
Overseas Chinese and 800,000 residents from Hong Kong and Macao. 
Some 80 percent of the population of Taiwan can trace their 
roots to the province. 
  Deemed a frontier for national defence, however, Fujian 
benefited little from the state economically in the first two 
decades after the people's republic was founded in 1949. 
  With the introduction of the policy of opening up to the 
outside world and the easing of tensions across the Taiwan 
straits, the province spent a total of 15 billion yuan (about 
1.78 billion U.S. dollars) during the 13 years from 1979 to 1992 
on energy, raw materials, communications and telecommunications 
projects. A total of 13 such projects went into production last 
year alone. 
  Now the province's three airports -- in this provincial 
capital, Xiamen and Wuyishan -- boast over 70 routes linking it 
with all the major Chinese cities as well as Hong Kong, 
Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia. 
  Its 400 harbors of various sizes connect the province with 
Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, Japan and Thailand. Modern railway 
and highway transportation and telecommunications facilities 
make the province an increasingly attractive spot for overseas 
investment along with an ample power supply. 
  Along with improved infrastructure, various organizations 
have sprung up in Fujian to help foreign investors with 
registration, hard currency adjustment, insurance and supply of 
production materials. 
  The move has proved effective as the province had approved 
the setting up of 12,797 overseas-funded enterprises by the end 
of 1993, with a total contractual investment of 22.52 billion 
U.S. dollars. Nearly six billion U.S. dollars of this has 
actually been used, making up ten percent of the country's total 
foreign investment. 
  In the first quarter of this year the province attracted 626 
million U.S. dollars in overseas investment and exported 1.45 
billion U.S. dollars-worth of products, representing increases 
of 52.1 and 42, 8 percent, respectively. 
  To accelerate its economic development, Fujian has further 
drawn up policies to encourage overseas investment in 
infrastructure construction and push ahead with reform in 
various sectors so as to meet the international standards of 
economic development. The province is also busy working out 
regulations to protect the legal rights of overseas investors.

  [Text] Recently more and more positive moves have been 
taken in deepening state-owned enterprise reform. Following 6 
and 9 June, when the Jiangxi machine tools plant and the 
Nanchang steelworks were turned into state-owned, 
limited-liability companies, a series of 32 wholly state-funded 
companies, which were listed as pilot enterprises by the 
provincial government, will be employing this operational 
mechanism. This marks that Jiangxi has entered a new stage in 
comprehensively reforming state-owned enterprises in accordance 
with a modern enterprise system. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the provincial government 
has actively promoted experiments in reforming industrial 
enterprises. On 5 January this year, the governor's and vice 
governors' work meeting adopted a decision on selecting 32 large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to conduct experiments 
in forming wholly state-funded limited-liability companies, and 
approved the 10-point proposal formulated by the provincial 
commission for restructuring economy and the provincial economic 
commission. Since then, each of the enterprises accordingly has 
set up an experimental leading group; done an active job in such 
basic work as checkup of warehouses, assessment of assets, and 
revaluation of assets; readjusted the economic structure in 
strict accordance with the stipulations of the Company Law; 
optimized the disposition of resources, with the stress on 
system upgrading; and established a new structure under which 
property rights are clearly defined, government and enterprise 
functions are separated, and management is scientific; thus 
speeding up the pace of establishing a modern enterprise system. 
  It has been learned that the province's 32 selected pilot 
enterprises occupy an important position among the large- and 
medium-sized enterprises, and their products are in line with 
the state's industrial policy, are marketable, and can produce 
good economic results. Their leading bodies are of sound 
quality and their enterprise management has a solid foundation. 
They have managed to operate in accordance with the 
stipulations of the Company Law and to separate state ownership 
from the property rights of the enterprise legal persons, 
avoiding reliance on administrative organs. Hence, the state's 
once-unlimited responsibility for enterprises has become limited 
responsibility.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai Municipal 
Government announced Friday [17 June] the removal of the No. 2 
Commerce Bureau and Aquatic Products Bureau. 
  This is another step taken by the government to streamline 
its structure. 
  The dismissal of the two bureaus does not mean an emergence 
of another two departments to replace them. According to the 
reform program, the government has decided to set up two offices 
with only 20 staff each to carry out trade management and some 
administrative functions. The two bureaus had a combined 
employment of 330. 
  The two bureaus were set up around 1960 to take charge of 
the 
production, sales and supply of non-staple foodstuffs. 
  Shanghai has established a market mechanism with the 
government exercising macro-economic control while markets 
determine prices. Also, cooperatives and individuals are 
occupying a greater portion of the market. All these have made 
some of the functions of government departments obsolete. 
  The closing of the two bureaus is a test in streamlining 
Shanghai's government structure. According to a high ranking 
official, the mode of management of enterprises is changing. 
The state administration of enterprises has turned to an 
indirect way. More decision making power will be given to 
enterprises. 
  Since non-staple foodstuffs and aquatic products remain 
highly sensitive to market fluctuations, these commodities still 
need close government supervision. The newly established 
Shanghai non-staple foodstuffs and aquatic products offices will 
help to control their production and sales, keep reserves of 
sensitive goods, and make better use of production and sales 
funds.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A 10,000-line 
terminal program-controlled interchange system for international 
telephone calls and a 30,000-line terminal program-controlled 
interchange system for domestic calls that make up an extension 
project hailed as the "giant highway interchange" for 
long-distance communications were checked and accepted by the 
Shanghai Posts and Telecommunications Bureau, which was 
entrusted by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry. 
  The completion of these two major interchange systems 
increased Shanghai's total capacity for long-distance 
communications interchange by 25 times over a decade ago and 
upgraded the degree of full automation of its long-distance 
communication to over 97 percent from 10 percent in 1985. 
  It has been learned that the 10,000-line terminal 
program-controlled interchange system for international 
telephone calls, which was operational upon completion, has been 
put under a test run; while 10,000 long-distance lines of the 
30,000-line terminal program-controlled interchange system for 
domestic calls have been opened to communications, with the 
remaining 20,000 reserved for future expansion.

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- The continuous high 
temperatures in the past month or so in and around the nation's 
capital city have left tens of thousands of ha [hectares] of 
farmland parched. 
  Beijing has been dry for more than ten months. Water 
reserves in the Guanting and Miyun reservoirs, the two main 
water suppliers for Beijing, are decreasing, and the underground 
water table is continuously dropping. 
  It is estimated that if the high temperatures continue, 
during this summer the city will be short of 150,000 cu m to 
230,000 cu m of water daily. 
  The municipal government has taken measures to control 
industrial water use to ensure the needs of its residents. 
  Establishments which use more than the allowed amount of 
water will be charged double the normal fee. 
  Beijing is promoting a household-water-saving drive among 
its 
city residents. Every household should be equipped with a water 
meter. And residents are advised to use water more than once 
before it is drained off, for instance, using the water in which 
clothes have been washed to clean the floor. 
  Meanwhile, the high temperatures and lack of rain are 
threatening the summer crop planting in the suburbs.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Han Shaojun (7281 4801 0689): "Persistently </F>
Popularize the Public Bidding System"] 
  [Text] The numerous unhealthy trends arising in the public 
bidding system of Hebei's construction and decoration trades due 
to imperfect market system have drawn the great attention of the 
provincial party committee. On the afternoon of 7 June, Cheng 
Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, and other 
provincial leaders, including Liu Shanxiang and Guo Shichang, 
heard reports on popularization of the public bidding system and 
the unhealthy trends in the construction market given by the 
provincial and Shijiazhuang city construction committees, 
construction industry bureaus, and bidding offices. Chen Weigao 
pointed out: Construction and decoration trades have made 
important contributions to Hebei's urban construction and 
construction of key projects, but some architectural and 
construction units have conducted trade between power and money 
when contracting construction projects because the construction 
market has yet to be fully cultivated, the mechanism of market 
competition has yet to be standardized, the laws and regulations 
for the trades are imperfect, and management of the trades is 
still weak. This has not only brought about tremendous economic 
losses to the state and turned a number of important projects 
into high-priced and low-quality projects with hidden danger. 
But it has also led some cadres to the road of crimes, such as 
bribery and embezzlement. This has become a conspicuous problem 
in the anticorruption struggle. For this reason, in our effort 
to oppose corruption, advocate honesty, and correct the 
unhealthy trends of some trades, we should pay attention to this 
problem. 
  Cheng Weigao emphasized: To make the work successful, we 
should coordinate the endeavors to build the market, strengthen 
management of public bidding work, establish the market 
competition mechanism, and strengthen the supervision and 
management of the market with those to oppose corruption and 
advocate honesty, check unhealthy trends, and investigate and 
handle major and serious cases. He called for efforts to start 
with five aspects of work. First, we should strengthen the 
fundamental managerial work for construction projects. We 
should clarify who are to hold the responsibilities, implement 
the project report system, screen and approve the projects 
strictly based on their planning, designing, and construction 
procedures, make all construction units implement the public 
bidding system, and strengthen the supervision and management of 
the quality after the projects are started. Second, the public 
bidding system should be persistently applied to all 
construction and decoration projects. The extremely small 
number of projects to which the system cannot be applied due to 
special reasons should be screened and approved by authorized 
departments. Projects for which bids are to be negotiated 
should be screened and approved by authorized departments before 
bids are determined. In the process of inviting and entering 
bids, government administrative departments are prohibited from 
giving intervention, and leading cadres are prohibited from 
giving hints on or forcing the designation of the construction 
units by giving approvals or admonitions. Construction units 
which give pressure on architectural units in the name leading 
cadres and intervene in the bidding procedures, once discovered, 
should be disqualified from the construction and dispelled from 
the province if they come from other provinces. Construction 
licenses will not be issued to the architectural units which do 
not invite bids or negotiate bids without approval. Third, 
focusing on promoting the public bidding system, we should 
establish and improve the compatible construction market 
mechanism as well as laws and regulations. We should also 
establish and improve bidding organizations, appraisal 
organizations, and intermediary organizations. Fourth, in the 
process of inviting and entering bids, it is strictly forbidden 
to give parties and gifts or to offer sight-seeing tours in the 
name of observation. Fifth, we should investigate and handle 
major and serious cases. When construction investment is found 
to be greatly disparate from the construction results, we should 
strengthen auditing and inspection of them and sternly deal with 
the people who have abused power to extort money and take and 
ask for bribes.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Baiyangdian, a 
renowned lake and tourism attraction in north China's Hebei 
Province, has become dry again at this time this year, resulting 
in losses to a dozen counties and cities around it. 
  More than 180,000 people live by the lake. 
  The few tourists are found walking on the dried-up lake bed 
and tourism boats are laid up. Hotels, restaurants and holiday 
villages are closed. 
  The present time would normally be the high season for local 
tourism. But the 390-sq-km lake, which used to be famous for 
its aquatic products, is now nearly bare of visitors. 
  Zhu Weijue, a deputy chief engineer with the Hebei 
Provincial 
Water Conservancy Bureau, said that the present drought, 
starting in 1991, has been the worst in 50 years. Water from 
rivers feeding the lake has been diverted for agricultural and 
industrial use. 
  The Hebei provincial government is making efforts to help 
local people fight the drought and try to reduce the damage to 
the minimum. 
  The lake was dry for five years from 1983 to 1987, its 
longest dry period. In 1988, the lake was again filled with 
water. 
  Zhu said weather forecast shows that it will be a dry year 
for the central and southern parts of northern China, including 
Baiyangdian lake. Rainfall will be far from enough to refill 
the lake in the near future, he noted.

<F P=106> [By reporters Chen Yongping (7115 3057 1627), Yu Jie (0060 </F>
2638), Wang Qing (3769 7230): "Wage Arduous Struggle, Open Up 
and Keep Forging Ahead, Ensure the Fulfillment of the `3-7 
Specific Plan for Helping the Poor'"] 
  [Excerpts] Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional 
party committee, delivered a speech at the regional work 
conference on helping the poor to achieve development on 6 June, 
in which he pointed out: It is very important for the region to 
fulfill the "3-7" plan for dealing with the problems encountered 
by 30 million poor people throughout the region with regard to 
dressing warmly and eating their fill during the seven years 
before the end of this century. Therefore, we must adhere to 
the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic 
line, be based on reality, fulfill the plan on schedule and 
without fail, and win a victory in handling the knotty problems. 
  Attending yesterday's conference were leading personnel from 
the regional level organs, including Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, 
Liu Zhen, Zhang Tingwu, Yang Zizhen, and Alatanaoqier. 
  In his speech Wang Qun pointed out: The "8-7" plan 
formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
for helping 80 million poor people throughout the country deal 
with their problems of dressing warmly and eating their fill 
during the seven years before the end of this century has a 
bearing on the whole situation. It is a big event that has a 
bearing on the interests of China and the Chinese nation. Over 
the past half century, the CPC has experienced countless 
complications in leading the people of various nationalities 
across the country and also scored great achievements attracting 
worldwide attention. However, there are 80 million people in 
the country and 30 million people in the region, who are still 
in poverty status. This warrants leadership at all levels 
meditate. In this sense, fulfilling the "8-7" specific plan 
marks a great historical change in which China and Chinese 
nation have thereupon cast off the poverty and entered a 
brand-new, wealthy, civilized, and developed period. Only by 
thoroughly casting off poverty can we eloquently prove that 
poverty and polarization do not belong to socialism. Only 
commonly becoming wealthy represents the socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and can prove that the CPC is completely and 
thoroughly working for the happiness and interest of the vast 
majority. Wang Qun pointed out: We should implement the spirit 
of directive given by Comrade Jiang Zemin with regard to 
"thinking of new ways in helping the poor." Specific measures 
adopted by the region in fulfilling its "3-7" plan chiefly are 
as follows: 
  1. It is imperative to foster the viewpoints of the market 
economy in helping the poor by handling the knotty problems. 
The establishment of systems of socialist market economy has 
brought about an excellent opportunity of development to the 
poor localities. The volume of demands raised by both vast 
domestic and foreign markets to the professions of planting and 
raising and to the industries of natural resources has become 
increasingly large. This is just a good opportunity for the poor 
localities to vigorously carry out their plans. We must renew 
our concepts and accelerate the development of the large-scale 
commodity economy. We cannot become wealthy by engaging in the 
production of petty commodities and will certainly be rich by 
engaging in the production of important ones. 
  2. We must first help the poor foster their confidence while 
giving support to them. We should direct the poor localities 
and households to wage an arduous struggle, to be self-reliant, 
to define their own goal in line with their reality, and to be 
determined to cast off poverty and become wealthy. 
  3. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we 
should be based on deepening the reform in rural and pastoral 
areas. According to the market law, a good job should be done 
in readjusting the industrial structure and product mix of rural 
and pastoral areas. First, we should stabilize the household 
responsibility system linked with their output of rural and 
pastoral areas. Based on this foundation, we should establish 
or improve the dual system with the integration between 
centralized and decentralized management and gradually expand 
the scale of collectively owned economy to enhance the actual 
strength of collectives in helping the poor. Efforts should be 
made to bring into play the enthusiasm of collectives and poor 
households so as to give full expression to the socialist 
superiority. 
  4. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we 
must adhere to the principle of supporting the poor in the 
course of development. Supporting the poor in the course of 
development means that it is necessary to rely on the joint 
forces fostered by the state support and the cooperation of the 
masses to develop or build the projects of casting off poverty 
and becoming wealthy. In view of the autonomous region, 
measures to conduct capital construction among farm fields and 
pastoral farms and to build the projects of ecological benefits 
should be adopted to improve the productive conditions and to 
build some proper-scale bases of farm and livestock commodities, 
which have stable and high yields as well as high benefits. 
  5. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we 
should concentrate our financial and material resources on 
giving priority to dealing with the key problems encountered by 
poor localities and households and on creating necessary 
conditions for them. 
  6. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we 
should bring political strong points into play. The region has 
had a long-standing tradition of unity among the nationalities 
and progress, as well as of equality and mutual assistance among 
various nationalities. We should carry out the activities of 
encouraging the masses to commonly become wealthy, issue the 
letter of responsibility to every household, and turn the 
activities into the conscious act of the masses. 
  7. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, a 
good job should be done in conducting intellectual, scientific, 
and technological support. In conducting poverty control, we 
must first carry out ignorance control and vigorously conduct 
the activities of social education. Efforts should be made to 
forcibly make cultural knowledge popular, to popularize science 
and technology, and to enable the poor households to obtain one 
or several capabilities in technology. 
  8. Tasks adopted for helping the poor by handling the knotty 
problems should be fulfilled within the given date. Leadership 
at all levels should integrate without conditions or haggling 
the principle of having the people, townships (sumu), banners 
(counties) become wealthy with the development of the 
banner-county level economy, as well as of township and vanguard 
enterprises. They should develop enterprises with various 
ownerships and be winners in having markets well in mind and in 
casting off poverty. 
  Lastly Wang Qun stressed: Party committees and governments 
at all levels should enhance their leadership over the work. 
Principal leading personnel should take personal charge of the 
work and leading personnel sharing the tasks in this regard 
should earnestly grasp the work. They should strengthen their 
services and realistically assume the duties imposed on them by 
history. Efforts should be made to establish the systems of 
supervision and inspection in this regard and to win a new 
victory in deepening the reform, fostering unity and stability, 
and making the economy leap forward. 
  During the work conference, Wu Liji also delivered a speech 
in which he pointed out: In fulfilling the region's "3-7" plan 
for helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, it is 
imperative to achieve in adhering to the following seven 
principles: 
  First, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the 
work of dealing with the problems of dressing warmly and eating 
one's fill with that of becoming better-off and wealthy. 
[passage omitted] 
  Second, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the 
work of helping the poor in the course of development with that 
of helping the poor while conducting opening up. [passage 
omitted] 
  Third, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the 
work of encouraging the people to become wealthy with that of 
encouraging townships, banners, and counties to do so. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fourth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating 
economic development with intellectual development. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fifth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating 
material production with population growth. [passage omitted] 
  Sixth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the 
material civilization drive with that of spiritual civilization. 
[passage omitted] 
  Seventh, we should adhere to the principle of integrating 
state support with local self-reliance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Hongqiao District people's court examined and 
concluded a case of trafficking in and counterfeiting state 
money; and punished, according to laws, the criminal offenders 
relating to this case. Zhao Zhixiang was sentenced to six 
years imprisonment and a 5,176 yuan fine was imposed. Sun 
Yuhong was sentenced to six years imprisonment. Lu Zhenjie was 
sentenced to three years imprisonment and three years probation. 
  While chatting with Sun Yuhong, a peasant from Anhui 
Province 
working in Tianjin, Criminal Zhao Zhixiang was informed that 
Renminbi can be changed for counterfeit Renminbi in Jieshou city 
of Anhui Province, where Sun was from. Zhou thought that he 
could seek profits from this. Therefore, they ganged up with Lu 
Zhenjie, with whom they were acquainted. Through premeditation, 
these three persons went to Jieshou city last September. Lu 
Zhenjie waited for them at an inn. Through the contacts of Sun 
Yuhong, Zhao Zhixiang and Sun Yuhong respectively changed 10,000 
yuan, which were offered by Lu Zhenjie, for 27,650 yuan 
according to different exchange proportions. In this very 
period, Zhao Zhixiang did not return to the place where they 
stayed at the appointed time. Lu Zhenjie thought that the real 
fact was exposed and went back to Tianjin. Zhao and Sun went 
back to Tianjin with counterfeit money and gave Lu 20,800 yuan. 
Zhao, Sun, and Sun Yumin, Sun's brother (who had once been 
transformed through labor) bought, on several dozen occasions, 
cigarettes, foodstuffs, handkerchiefs, and some other goods with 
the counterfeit money in Tianjin. They spent more than 3,000 
yuan of counterfeit money. 
  After learning of Lu's activities, Lu's relatives met with 
Zhao Zhixiang several times and asked him to exchange the 
counterfeit money for 10,000 yuan in Renminbi. Zhao refused and 
both sides argued with each other. On 26 September last year, 
accompanied by his relatives, Lu Zhenjie took his counterfeit 
money, totaling 20,800 yuan, and surrendered to the security 
organ. Simultaneously, Zhao and Sun were arrested under Lu's 
guidance. 
  The security organ discovered 3,100 yuan of counterfeit 
money 
at Zhao Zhixiang's house. In addition to 20,800 yuan 
surrendered by Lu Zhenjie, 23,900 yuan of counterfeit money was 
withdrawn by the Tianjin branch of the People's Bank of China.

  [Text] Tianjin, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Professional education 
in this north China port city is becoming diversified as more 
than 300 such schools with over 500 specialities in basic and 
higher learning have been founded over the past few years. 
  According an education official, in Tianjin there are now 
more than 100,000 students who are studying at various 
vocational schools. About 40,000 graduate every year. 
  "Entering university is not the sole choice for high-school 
students," the official said. 
  To meet the increasing demands of the booming labor market, 
he said, the city has since 1990 earmarked more than 70 million 
yuan to build vocational schools. And township enterprises and 
foreign- funded joint ventures are also encouraged to run such 
schools. 
  The city has trained a total of over 110,000 specialists and 
skilled workers in technology and management over the past four 
years. 
  According to the official, in the coming years the focus of 
professional education is to be shifted to the rural areas, and 
about 70 percent of rural middle-school graduates will be 
trained in special skills.

  [Text] When inspecting Guizhou from 7 to 14 June, Qiao 
Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress, pointed out: Guizhou should seize 
opportunities, accelerate development, and further bring about 
the enthusiasm of the masses of the people of all nationalities 
and the vast number of party-member cadres so that it will 
gradually forge ahead along the path of economic development 
with great strides as an inland province which is not situated 
near the sea, rivers, or boundary lines. 
  Accompanied by provincial party Secretary Liu Fangren, 
Governor Chen Shineng, provincial people's congress standing 
committee Chairman Wang Chaowen, and others, Qiao Shi drove for 
thousands of li and went down to industrial and mining 
enterprises, schools, nationality villages, and peasants 
households in Qiannan and Qiandongnan Prefectures, and held 
extensive contracts with the masses of people and cadres to find 
out about their production, lives, education, and their efforts 
to shake off poverty. Qiao Shi was very pleased after having 
learned that the economies of these nationality areas had 
developed, their people's living standards had improved, social 
stability prevailed, and people of all nationalities lived in 
harmony. In Yaonshan township in the Yao Nationality, Libo 
County, walking along a country path, Comrade Qiao Shi visited 
the home of He Laopo who was a peasant and inquired if his 
family had enough grain to eat and if they had difficulties in 
production and their livelihood. In a nationality primary 
school in Yaoshan Township, township head He Zhiyong informed 
him: In the last few years, although Yaoshan is poor, it has 
never relaxed its efforts in education. Comrade Qiao Shi was 
relieved to hear that and said to the provincial, prefectural, 
and county leaders who were around him: Well done. It is 
important to pay close attention to education. So long as the 
cultural quality of the peasants is raised, there will be hope 
of putting an end to the rural areas' poverty and backwardness. 
At Miaoliang Village in the Shandu Shui Nationality Autonomous 
County, after visiting a room for the village party branch and 
also for militiamen and youths to carry out their activities, 
Qiao Shi said with elation: This is good form. If all rural 
grass-roots units function well, we can accomplish our work. He 
hoped the Shui Nationality would unite with all other 
nationalities across the country and better carry out national 
construction. At the Duyun Dongfang Machine Tool Plant and the 
Kali Polyester Fiber Spinning and Weaving Machine Company, 
Comrade Qiao Shi warmly shook the hands of the workers, which 
were stained with greasy dirt, and spoke with them, inquiring in 
detail about their enterprises' production, operation, and 
product sales. He encouraged enterprises to make great efforts 
to improve product quality, open up more markets, and develop 
themselves by relying on their own strength. 
  On the afternoon of 11 June, accompanied by the provincial 
and Qiandongnan autonomous prefectural leaders, Chairman Qiao 
Shi arrived at Langde Village of the Miao nationality in Leishan 
County. With compatriots of the Miao nationality clustering 
around, he climbed up along a small winding path and after 
drinking wine offered by the hospitable compatriots of the Miao 
nationality, he arrived at the village cultural center, where he 
watched with great interest traditional Miao nationality 
programs including dances performed by villagers accompanied by 
reed pine wind and other instruments. When the chairman danced 
a unity dance with the villagers to the drum beats, the gaiety 
reached a climax. At the end, the chairman wrote an inscription 
with a brush, which read: Strengthen national unity and develop 
the economies of the nationality areas. 
  During his visit to our province, Comrade Qiao Shi also 
visited the former residence of the martyr Deng Enmin, deputy of 
the party's first congress, and the nationality museum of 
Qiandongnan Autonomous County. He also listened respectively to 
the work reports of the provincial party committee, the 
provincial people's congress, and the provincial government and 
made an important speech. He pointed out: Now is the best time 
for our country's construction and development. The domestic 
and international situations are conducive to our country's 
economic construction. He encouraged everybody to have a 
profound understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
instructions, seize the opportunity, and further develop 
Guizhou's economic construction. 
  When discussing Guizhou's economic work, Qiao Shi said: 
Guizhou, which is not situated near the sea, rivers, or 
boundary lines, has vast mountain areas which are poverty 
stricken and beset with many difficulties. For Guizhou to solve 
its difficulties, it is true that the province needs support 
from the central authorities and help from all sides concerned, 
but in the final analysis, it should rely on its own strength. 
Importantly, it must be noticed that Guizhou has huge potential 
and many strong points, which should be brought into play by 
relying on the masses of the people to invigorate the province's 
economy. He fully affirmed the practice of the provincial party 
committee and government to always put agriculture and rural 
work in the first place of economic work. He said: Guizhou has 
had great success in developing agriculture. It should take a 
broader view of things and implement the idea of agriculture in 
a broader sense down to work in all fields generation after 
generation. Guizhou has good prospects for agricultural 
development. While doing a good job of grain, it should develop 
animal husbandry, cultivation, and commercial crops, such as 
fruits and tea, by suiting measures to local conditions. It 
should develop township and town enterprises by basing itself on 
local raw and semifinished materials, in particular, processing 
industries. He pointed out: Guizhou has extremely abundant 
natural resources, in particular, energy and nonferrous metal 
resources. Guizhou's strong points, dubbed the coal sea of the 
area south of the lower reaches of the Zhang Jiang, should be 
brought into good play. Its rich water resources should also be 
exploited and utilized at an accelerated pace, with equal stress 
on the development of thermal and hydropower stations. Guizhou 
has a considerable foundation for aluminum production and, 
moreover, it has electric power. So aluminum production has 
bright prospects. 
  In road construction, Guizhou should strive to build more 
main highways to link with the high-grade highways of the 
surrounding provinces and autonomous regions. Forces of all 
sides concerned should be mobilized to expedite construction in 
other fields of endeavor. Every possible means should be tried 
to speed up the construction of projects where conditions are 
ripe. Qiao Shi stressed: For Guizhou to speed up the pace of 
its development, it should bring the enthusiasm of its 34 
million people of all nationalities into full play and 
strengthen lateral ties and cooperation with its fraternal 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions while striving 
for support and help from the central authorities and relevant 
departments. It should speed up the pace of reform and opening 
up to the outside world, do a good job of building the 
investment environment, and absorb more foreign capital and 
technology. To put it briefly, we hope that Guizhou will 
further emancipate its mind, acquire a broader view of things, 
take a broader path, open up more avenues of development, and 
strive for faster economic development. 
  When talking about the work of the people's congress, Qiao 
Shi stressed: We should strengthen the building of socialist 
democracy and legal system and establish a law system 
commensurate with the socialist market economy in accordance 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. He said: The task of the people's 
congress is very important. The work of the people's congresses 
at all levels, including legislation, publicity on the legal 
system, and supervision of law enforcement, should be 
strengthened. To establish a law system for the socialist 
economy, we should mobilize forces from all sides concerned to 
get involved. This is also a process of extensively developing 
democracy. Strengthening the work of the people's congresses at 
the grass-roots level is of great significance to the building 
of the basic-level party organizations, of political power, and 
of the legal system. Comrade Qiao Shi believes that under the 
leadership of the provincial party committee and government, the 
people of all nationalities in Guizhou will surely be able to 
build Guizhou better by upholding the party's basic line, 
deepening reform, and opening wider to the outside world.

  [Excerpt] On 15 June the State Council Information Office 
[SCIO], the United Front Work Department [UFWP] of the CPC 
Central Committee,the State Nationalities Affairs Commission 
[SNAC], and the Ministry of Culture jointly sponsored a victory 
meeting for the Tibetan Art Troupe that just returned home 
triumphantly from its maiden international tour. 
  Present at the meeting were State Councillor Ismail Amat; 
SCIO director Zeng Jianhui; Tudao Doje, vice minister of the 
SNAC;, Liu Deyou, vice minister of culture; and Li Dek Su, 
deputy director of the UFWP. 
  Leaders of the four units delivered ebullient congratulatory 
speeches at the meeting. They fully affirmed the art troupe's 
first, immensely successful international tour. They believed 
that the art troupe not only triumphantly accomplished its tour 
but also displayed with flying colors the graceful bearing of 
Tibet. Its repertoire, filled with the characteristics of 
Tibetan culture and artistic charm, shook Austria and Sweden. 
It demonstrated to the world that the magnificent Tibetan 
culture is fully protected and flourishing in the vast territory 
of the motherland, exposing with facts the rumors spread by 
splittist forces abroad and enabling more people to gain a 
correct understanding of Tibet. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Watch Out for Li Teng-Hui's Words and Deeds </F>
About `Taiwan Independence'"] 
  [Text] In a lengthy talk with Japanese writer Ryotaro Shiba 
(Terukazu Fukuda) in March this year, Li Teng-hui expressed many 
views unheard before. The most conspicuous ones are: First, 
the Kuomintang is a "immigrant political power," and second, 
"the term `China' is ambiguous." In addition he repeatedly 
stressed the grief of the Taiwan people. These remarks would 
not be surprising if they had been made by one advocating Taiwan 
independence, but they were made by none other than Li Teng-hui, 
the Kuomintang chairman and Taiwan's supreme leader, to a 
Japanese writer who stubbornly adheres to a militarist stand, so 
they cannot but arouse great public concern. 
  Though their conversation was casual, its theme was quite 
clear: Li tried to deny the existence of China and that Taiwan 
is a part of China. He even went so far as to consider himself 
a "Moses" who will deliver the Taiwan people "from Egypt." What 
he implied was understood. Since Li is Taiwan's supreme leader, 
with real power in his hands, if his political and historical 
philosophy were to be put into practice, it would bring disaster 
to Taiwan. 
  Li made a glaring mistake in logic and in practice by 
describing the Kuomintang as an "immigrant political power," as 
he himself is Kuomintang chairman, as well as Taiwan's 
president. He was elected by the "national congress," which 
together with Kuomintang moved to Taiwan from the mainland in 
1949, and he was promoted as "vice president" by Chiang 
Ching-kuo after he had served the "immigrant political power" 
for many years. Li described the Kuomintang as an "immigrant 
political power" in order to deny the rationality of the 
political power. By doing so, however, he debased his own power 
and denied the rationality of the Taiwan authorities. This 
might be a reason why principal media in Taiwan did not report 
the interview. 
  His attempt to deny the existence of China is both 
ridiculous 
and lamentable. The concept of China or the Chinese nation is 
clearly defined, which no clown like Ryotaro Shiba can deny. In 
the early period of this century, China suffered from domestic 
trouble and foreign invasion, including the invasion of Taiwan 
by Japanese militarists, but all this is gone, never to return. 
China now is marching toward modernization, and no one can 
prevent its rise from oblivion. China is now an important, 
widely respected member of the international community, and the 
Chinese nation never has been so united as it is today. The 
attempt by a few people who alienate themselves from the Chinese 
nation, forget their own origins, and sing a duet with those 
disgraceful foreigners who are trying to bring imperialism back 
to life can be compared only to a mayfly trying to shake against 
a giant tree. They ridiculously overrate themselves. 
  The conversation reflected Li's gloomy ideas in his heart of 
hearts. It absolutely was no accident that he chose Ryotaro 
Shiba as his partner in conversation, nor was it that he 
repeatedly beautified the Japanese invaders' rule over Taiwan. 
He impudently alleged that "Taiwan independence" would lead to 
"Tibet and Xinjiang independence," "making it very difficult for 
Beijing to establish a greater Asia Chinese nation [da zhong hua 
min zu ya zhou 1129 0022 5478 3046 2469 0068 3166]." For the 
leader of the Taiwan authorities to express such a view cannot 
but arouse great concern among the people on both sides of the 
Taiwan Straits. Since the end of the Cold War, civil war has 
broken out in a number of countries, such as Bosnia-Hercegovina 
in Europe, Georgia in the Near East, and most recently in Yemen. 
The international community is loath to see such turbulence 
because it can only plunge the people into misery and suffering, 
and endanger regional security. This also teaches the people of 
other countries how social security and territorial integrity 
are important to them. The area of Taiwan is only 35,000 square 
meters and its economy is of a sea-island type. Taiwan's 
current economic and social situations have not come easily. It 
is extremely irresponsible for a person in power to separate 
Taiwan from the mainland because such an act is against the 
interests of the Chinese nation, including the Taiwan people, 
and against the current trend of peace and development. 
  If the person in power resorts to the former colonialist and 
foreign forces in trying to split the country, he will drag 
Taiwan into an abyss and stand condemned through the ages. 
People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits must maintain high 
vigilance.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Jiaquan (2621 1367 3123): "Where Are His </F>
Emotions as a Chinese? -- Commenting on Li Teng-hui's 
Conversation With Ryotaro Shiba"] 
  [Text] Mr. Li Teng-hui said after taking charge of the 
government in Taiwan: "I am a Taiwanese as well as a Chinese." 
Li traces his ancestral home to Fujian Province's Yongding 
County, and he was born and brought up in Taiwan. Indeed, like 
he says himself, he is a Taiwanese as well as a Chinese, a 
Chinese who lives in Taiwan. Precisely because he has this kind 
of status and does not have the burdens known to Chiang Kai-shek 
and his son, people expect him to play a special and 
irreplaceable role across the strait, dissolve the "complex" 
left behind by history, and enable cross- strait relations or 
the Taiwan question to have a solution which is more reasonable 
and acceptable to various sides, thus, accomplishing a historic 
project which is even greater than the recovery of Taiwan and 
the "democratization of Taiwan." However, at this moment, 
people are indeed somewhat disappointed. 
<H5>  Great Revelation of the Secrets in His Heart </H5>
  Mr. Li Teng-hui's conversation with Ryotaro Shiba is a 
"great 
revelation" of the secrets in his heart. It seems that we do 
not see any feelings of him being a Chinese. In his 
conversation, he could not help revealing a certain kind of 
feeling that he missed being "Japanese," an identity which 
ceased when he was 22 years old. Regarding Ryotaro Shiba's words 
beautifying the aggressive behavior committed by the Japanese 
colonialists and imperialists in the past, and words which were 
hostile and encouraged the dismemberment of China, he listened 
comfortably and even went along with him and chimed in with him. 
On the other hand, he talked glibly about the so-called "sorrow 
of the Taiwan people," and traced the root of this sorrow to the 
Chinese mainland. He said the Kuomintang was a "regime coming 
from the outside," and he had doubts about the concept of 
"China." He even said explicitly that Beijing's idea of the 
reunification of the two sides of the strait was a "weird 
dream." In the beginning and at the end of the conversation, he 
compared himself with Moses, who, according to "Exodus" in the 
"Old Testament," led the Jews across the Red Sea to their native 
place to rebuild their houses and farms. His intention is very 
clear. No wonder many Chinese people on both sides of the 
strait, as well as overseas Chinese, are "shocked." 
<H5>  What Are the Emotions of a Chinese? </H5>
  As a Taiwan Chinese, one should understand the sentiments of 
the people there, and this is beyond reproach. Whether Li 
Teng-hui has really been able to do this is another matter. But 
I think that as a Taiwan Chinese, Mr. Li Teng-hui must not only 
understand the sentiments of the people there, but must also 
understand the sentiments of all Chinese people, and these two 
are in fact inseparable. The history of modern China is a 
history of China being invaded, exploited, and humiliated, and 
almost all the imperialist countries in the world have committed 
aggression against China. Situated on China's frontier, Taiwan 
suffered the most. The people on the mainland felt as if they 
themselves had suffered. In modern history, the rulers of China 
were weak and incompetent when dealing with foreign countries, 
but practiced sanguinary rule at home, and people on both sides 
of the strait suffered together. Speaking from this sense, the 
Taiwan people's sorrow is also the mainland people's sorrow, and 
is the common sorrow of the people on the two sides of the 
strait. The hearts of the people on the two sides of the strait 
are completely linked. It is neither adequate nor complete to 
see only the Taiwan people's sorrow. 
  The entire modern history of China is, first, a history of 
conflict between the people and imperialist aggressors, and 
second, a history of conflict between the people and reactionary 
rulers. The ceding of Taiwan to Japan by the Qing court after it 
lost the 1894 Sino-Japanese War, and the "28 February" incident 
which took place in Taiwan after its recovery and came under 
Kuomintang rule, are embodiments of these two major conflicts. 
Regarding this history, Taiwan's Chinese people should also 
have a clear understanding; they should not distort the nature 
and orientation of the conflicts or blame mainland people for 
the "Taiwan people's sorrow," or attribute that sorrow to a 
"regime coming from outside" the mainland, or even use it as an 
excuse to "fight communism and resist peace" and oppose the 
reunification of the two sides of the strait. 
  The emotions of the Chinese people on the two sides of the 
strait are inseparable. In history, the Chinese people on the 
two sides of the strait, in order to resist foreign aggression, 
oppose reactionary rule at home, fight for the independence of 
the Chinese nation, and safeguard the country's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, have struggled hand in hand, shed blood 
and sacrificed, and stepped into the breach as others fell. 
Bravely and indomitably, they have together written down 
numerous moving and glorious chapters. This kind of historical 
and national sentiment, which was crystallized in blood and tear 
can never be distorted and dispersed by the agitated and 
emotional words of a few people. 
  The mainland people are very happy to see the economic 
achievements made by the Taiwan people in the last several 
decades. What is strange is that, while Chinese people 
throughout the whole world are jubilant at the economic 
achievements made by the mainland over the past several years, 
some in Taiwan do not feel very comfortable; first, in the 
economic arena, they have adopted various measures to try to 
cool down the "mainland craze"; then, in the political arena, 
they made a fuss over the Qiandao Lake incident," trying hard to 
distort the feelings of Taiwan compatriots toward the mainland. 
What is their intention? 
<H5>  Must Not Mislead People's Emotions </H5>
  Regarding the emotions of the Chinese who are in Taiwan, 
there is the question of "understanding," as well as a question 
of "guidance." Whether these emotions can be properly 
understood and guided is to a great extent determined by whether 
those in power can properly perceive themselves and history. We 
have noticed that Mr Li Teng-hui, as a scholar, is quite capable 
of considering "how to exercise self-restraint," just as he 
himself said during the conversation, and that he is quite 
humble and objective when handling matters; in short, he has 
scientific attitude, and this is precisely one of the important 
reasons why he has earned "trust" and "respect" from various 
quarters in Taiwan. However, now, along with the changes in his 
power and status, just like someone has said, he has become 
"complacent." This time, when Ryotaro Shiba flattered him by 
boasting about his "key to grasping politics" and said that he 
was quite "at home using political strategy," Li immediately 
told him: "I have been very keen since I was a child," and 
people even "alleged that I am a military genius!" Perhaps that 
is a fact. But judged from history, when a person, especially a 
political figure, sees only his own role or overestimates his 
own role, then he begins to make mistakes, as if the world is 
his and nothing is impossible. He sees himself as a "savior," as 
if what he "thinks" is what the people "want." The result is 
divergence from the people, divergence from reality, and 
breaking his head to the extent of bleeding. 
  Judged from Taiwan's actual conditions, people are not free 
from this kind of worry. Since Li Teng-hui took charge of the 
government in Taiwan, he has indeed done some good things for 
the Taiwan people, and has made his own contribution to the 
improvement of cross-strait relations. However, after 
accomplishing "constitutional reform" with "high proficiency," 
some unrealistic ideas of his have emerged. Taiwan is an 
inseparable part of China, and Taiwan people are Chinese people. 
But recently, a sense of separation with Taiwan as the mainstay 
has grown infinitely. The so-called "independent sovereignty" 
theory, "the country of Taiwan" theory, "the nation of Taiwan" 
theory, the theory of "giving priority to the interests of 
Taiwan," the theory of the "life commonwealth of Taiwan," the 
theory of "reinterpretation of sovereignty," the "Republic of 
China in Taiwan," and the "expedient measure of two China's" 
have all emerged. During this conversation, Mr. Li Teng-hui 
explicitly proposed the building of "a Taiwan people's country." 
Is this a deliberate attempt to "mislead" the people? When one 
considers that some people on the island worship Li Teng-hui as 
"Emperor Li," and express Li Teng-hui's "ideas and achievements" 
as "Li Teng-hui-ism," there is cause for worry. 
  It is understandable that as Chinese people living in 
Taiwan, 
they advocate love for Taiwan, "lifting heads," and "being the 
master." However, if certain people who have other intentions 
set love for Taiwan against love for the motherland; set 
"lifting heads" and "being the master" against the great 
undertaking of the reunification of the motherland; set the 
well-being of 21 million people against the long-term and basic 
interests of 1.2 billion people, that is, the whole nation; 
separate Taiwan people from Chinese people; and engage in the 
so-called "Taiwan people's country," then they will jeopardize 
the basic interests of the entire Chinese people, including 
those in Taiwan. Furthermore, it is very dangerous to do this 
as this would bring disastrous results to the 21 million Taiwan 
people, and the 1.2 billion Chinese people will never allow them 
to do this. 
<H5>  Chinese People's Affairs Should Be Handled By Chinese People </H5>
  A Chinese proverb goes: "A fly does not sting an egg which 
has no crack." Some unresolved "complexes" between the two 
sides of the strait and some people's speeches which advocate 
separation or have a separatist tendency, have already give 
opportunities to certain foreign forces. They fear China's 
reunification, unity, and prosperity, so they try hard to sow 
discord between the Chinese people on the two sides of the 
strait. The common trick they use is to "restrict Chinese with 
Chinese" and "separate them to control them." Is it not true 
that the so-called "restricting the Kuomintang with the 
Democratic Progressive Party," "restricting the CPC with the 
Kuomintang," and "restricting reunification with 'Taiwan 
independence'" are new tricks employed by certain aggressive 
foreign forces under the new historical conditions? History is 
a mirror, and individual and political parties alike must guard 
against being used as a tool by aggressive foreign forces to 
deal with his own motherland and compatriots. 
  The affairs of the Chinese people should be settled by the 
Chinese people themselves. Perhaps, due to personal experience, 
although Mr. Li Teng-hui admits being a Chinese, he lacks a real 
and thorough understanding of the Chinese people in Taiwan, and 
he has even less understanding of the Chinese people on the 
mainland, nor does he understand the thinkings and emotions of 
the entire Chinese people. Otherwise, it would be difficult to 
answer the following questions: The people on the two sides of 
the strait are Chinese people, but are unable to sit down 
together to discuss their home affairs, while every effort is 
made to have foreigners "weigh down" the Chinese. Is this not 
just the opposite to what people wish? Why cannot the leaders of 
the political parties or those in power on the two sides of the 
strait "talk face to face," while with this Japanese, who still 
harbors a great deal of hostility toward China and cherishes the 
Japanese occupation of Taiwan, he could sit side by side and 
talk intimately, sticking to each other like glue? 
  Why, in front of foreign leaders, can he "lower his body," 
"speak softly," and even "act humbly" to seek dialogue and 
communication, but mention "status," cite "price," pursue 
"equality," and in fact refuse others completely when hearing 
repeated calls from mainland leaders for dialogue and 
communication between the leaders of the two sides of the 
strait? There can only be one answer, that is, "using the 
external to restrict the internal"; as a result, foreigners reap 
the benefits. 
<H5>  True Meaning of So-Called "Sovereignty Rests With the </H5>
People" 
  Mr. Li Teng-hui has another theory, that is, "sovereignty 
rests with the people." The intention of preaching "sovereignty 
rests with the people" is to deal with the CPC's one country, 
two systems, to negate China's sovereignty over Taiwan, to use 
it as a banner in an attempt to enter the United Nations, and to 
create a "Taiwan people's country" which is separate from the 
mainland. In fact, this is precisely what certain foreign 
forces want. However, this can never be a way out. 
  What kind of "people" is the "people" in "sovereignty rests 
with the people?" Is it a people controlled and misled or a 
"people" completely free of control and who really understand 
the actual situation? Is it a portion or a minority of "people" 
or is it the entire and majority of "people?" These are great 
topics to be discussed. In history, we see various incidents in 
which the will of the "people" has been stolen to serve some 
people's political ambitions, but, eventually, even though they 
might have succeeded for a while, they could not escape the 
punishment of history. What is particularly worth mentioning is 
that, concerning the big matter of a country's sovereignty, it 
is never changed by a small number of conspirators who plot the 
"will of people." 
  The government and people on the mainland have exercised 
great restraint toward recent outrageous speeches made by some 
persons in the Taiwan authorities. Perhaps, because some of 
them are Taiwan-born people, the mainland has more or less "held 
back from doing anything against them for fear of involving good 
people," and this is also not to give foreigners loopholes to 
infiltrate. I hope they will not go too far down the road and 
will not see restraint as weakness with which they can take 
liberties, as they would be completely wrong. 
  Finally, I suggest that Mr. Li Teng-hui comes to the 
mainland 
to carry out research and inspection in the capacity of an 
individual. Since he says he can visit various countries in the 
name of "Dr. Li" or as an "agricultural expert," then why can he 
not come to the mainland with such a status? Please be aware 
that it is not feasible to formulate a mainland policy based on 
"assumptions" and the "emotional" thoughts of a small number of 
people without understanding the mainland and without 
understanding the real thoughts and emotions of 1.2 billion 
Chinese people.

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- "It was back in 1974 
that I felt that China would be a huge energy market. Now, my 
prediction of 20 years ago is proving correct." 
  Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of the France-China 
Committee and president of the GEC-Alsthom company, made this 
point to XINHUA during a recent visit to Beijing. 
  An old friend of China who had visited this country many 
times, Desgeorges contributed greatly to promoting Sino-French 
cooperation. 
  He was proud to recall that GEC-Alsthom had established 
business links with China in the 1950s, and in 1958 signed the 
first contract with China for locomotives. The company sold 
China 300 locomotives, which are still running well today. 
  Alsthom had also been involved in the construction of 
China's 
thermal and hydro-power electricity plants. 
  "China has been an extremely important market for Alsthom," 
Desgeorges said. "We earnestly hope to continue to cooperate 
with China in the fields of energy and traffic now that 
French-Sino relations have returned to a normal track." 
  Though the Alsthom-China contracts always cover huge 
programs, Desgeorges was not satisfied. 
  As China needs to strengthen its infrastructure, such as the 
energy industry, transport and telecommunications, in which 
fields France is in the forefront, he insisted that the 
contracts of large programs were not enough to give impetus to 
the comprehensive development of French-Sino trade and economic 
relations. 
  More numerous cooperation, that is contracts between Chinese 
and French medium-size and small enterprises and collaboration 
in medium-size and small programs, should be implemented, he 
said. 
  The development of medium-size and small enterprises, which 
offer large employment opportunities, was of great significance 
to China, he noted, because it has a lot of medium-size and 
small business concerns. 
  Desgeorges said the France-China Committee would investigate 
the situation of French medium-size and small enterprises and 
provide a list of those interested in China's market in various 
trades. 
  Desgeorges was in April elected president of the committee 
of 
France-China, which was set up in 1979, to develop French-Sino 
cooperation of industry and trade. It has 200 members, 
including some big enterprises and groups. 
  The committee will select the best ones to make contact 
direct with their Chinese counterparts. 
  Desgeorges added that they could cooperate in forms of 
technological cooperation, trade exchanges, joint management and 
even opening markets in a third country. 
  He suggested that China may establish a China-France 
committee as well so as to find Chinese medium-size and small 
enterprises willing to deal with the French ones.

  [Text] Bonn, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Sino-German bilateral 
trade should be developed further and cooperation between the 
two countries in all fields should be promoted, a German 
minister said here today. 
  The German Minister of the Economy, Guenter Rexrodt, made 
the 
remarks at a joint press conference for the first Sino-German 
medium-sized and small enterprises' conference which opened on 
Thursday. 
  He expressed the hope that Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit 
to 
Germany, scheduled for early July, would serve to develop 
Sino-German political and economic relations further, 
  Rexrodt said that Sino-German bilateral trade required 
further promotion and that China's infrastructure, its energy 
supply, transport and communications in particular, needed 
development. 
  Germany has long been China's most important economic 
partner 
in western Europe. In 1993, the volume of trade between the two 
countries reached 10 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 54.9 
percent from 1992. 
  The German minister said on Thursday that for Germany China 
was an extremely important investment market in Asia and its 
biggest economic partner among the developing countries. 
  He also expressed the hope that China would continue its 
successful economic reform policies. 
  Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, Shi Guangsheng, who is heading the Chinese 
delegation, today asked the European Union (EU) to abolish their 
discrimination against and restrictions on Chinese products. 
  In response, Rexrodt said Germany would try its best within 
the EU to have the restrictions rescinded. 
  The two-day Sino-German medium-sized and small enterprises' 
conference ended today. Some 250 items for cooperation were 
introduced by the two sides and 77 of them underwent serious 
discussion during the conference.

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- A leading German 
construction company, the Philipp Holzmann, is to build a 
"European square" in Beijing. 
  A letter of intent was signed a month ago by the company and 
the Beijing municipality, involving 200 million U.S. dollars. 
  Chinese senior leader Li Ruihuan had a brief meeting with 
Holzmann's chairman Lothar Mayer here this afternoon, praising 
the company for involving itself in this and other important 
projects in China and hoping that construction of such projects 
will be completed in time and with high quality. 
  These projects also include the Yansha Center in Beijing, a 
section of the express highway in Shanghai, a key water 
conservancy project in Sichuan Province and another one in the 
middle reaches of the Yellow River. 
  Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, told the visitor 
that during the past 15 years the Chinese Government and local 
authorities have given top priority to the fast-growing 
construction industry, resulting in a drastic face-lifing in the 
major cities. 
  Li expressed the conviction that Holzmann will get full 
support in China.

  [Text] Johannesburg, June 19 (XINHUA) -- South African 
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad has said his country is 
intending to establish diplomatic ties with China, according to 
THE SUNDAY TIMES here today. 
  The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign 
minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth 
Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy. 
  Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for 
South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential, 
but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic 
ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established 
diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 
  However, he stated, Taiwan is one of South Africa's largest 
trading partners. 
  "In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by 
our interests and international precedents." 
  Pahad said given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the 
focus will be to increase favorable economic relations with its 
traditional trading partners -- the United States and the 
European Union. 
  But, he said his country will also be looking beyond 
traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among 
others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's 
Republic of China and Latin America. 
  Another area where links were unexplored is the Middle East, 
not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.

  [Text] Wellington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- China will continue 
to uphold the policy of reform and opening-up and accelerate the 
establishment of a new market economic system, declared the 
visiting Chinese State Councilor Li Tieying here today. 
  In a speech at a reception given by the New Zealand Treasury 
this evening, Li said China will also quicken the pace to make 
its new economic system compatible with international practices 
and take an active part in the international competition and 
economic cooperation. 
  "This not only serves the fundamental interest of the 
Chinese 
people but also conforms to the common aspiration and 
fundamental interests of the people in the rest of the world," 
he said. 
  Li, also minister in charge of the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economic Reforms, briefed the New Zealand 
friends attending the reception about the achievements China has 
made since the start of its economic reform 15 years ago. 
  He attributed the achievements to the guidance of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  As China is an Asian country, developing and strengthening 
its economic relations and cooperation with countries and 
regions in the Asia-Pacific region constitutes an integral part 
of its overall opening-up policy, he stated. 
  Li expressed China's readiness to actively expand its 
cooperation with New Zealand in the political, economic, 
scientific, technological and cultural fields under the 
principle of equality and mutual benefit.

  [Text] Manila, June 20 (XINHUA) -- President Fidel Ramos 
has reaffirmed his government's commitment to forge closer ties 
with China and hopes the exchange of visits between the two 
countries will lead to the faster resolution of bilateral and 
regional problems.

and much improved relations between the Philippines and the 
People's Republic of China whose effects and benefits shall 
result in the faster solutions of bilateral problems between us 
as well as regional problems that may directly or indirectly 
affect our two countries," the president wrote. 
  Estrada is scheduled to meet with his counterpart, 
Vice-President Rong Yiren, and other officials of the Chinese 
Government. He will return to Manila on June 25.

<F P=106> [First part of a serial report on the Nansha Islands, </F>
entitled "The Pillboxes Are Linked With the Motherland," by 
station reporters (An Jinglin) and (Xiong Zengyan); from the 
"News and Press Review" program] 
  [Excerpts] [Begin station introduction] Dear listeners, the 
Nansha [Spratley] Islands, located at the farthest end of the 
vast expanse of China's maritime territory, are the southernmost 
of the South Sea islands. The islands spread out about 400 
nautical miles from east to west and 500 nautical miles from 
south to north in the waters, and cover numerous coral reefs and 
beaches as well as an enormous area totaling 820,000 square km, 
about the size of eight Jiangsu Provinces. They form an 
important passage linking the Indian Ocean with the Pacific 
Ocean, and serve as China's largest tropical fishing ground as 
well as treasure islands of petroleum and natural gas resources. 
The Zengmuansha basin is reputed to be a second Persian Gulf. 
As the Nanshas are close to the equator, fresh water is 
extremely scarce on the islands. Not a single blade of grass 
grows on the reefs; and the year-round scorching sun makes life 
unbearable. There, officers and men of the Navy's South Sea 
Fleet have overcome extraordinary obstacles and created the 
Nansha spirit, an epitome of patriotism. Recently, a group of 
station reporters went to Nansha on a news-gathering assignment. 
They visited pillboxes where naval officers and men were 
stationed and wrote a serial report in the form of travel notes. 
Today, we will broadcast the first part, which is entitled "The 
Pillboxes Are Linked With the Motherland" and is prepared by 
station reporters (An Jinglin) and (Xiong Zengyan). [End 
introduction] 
  Where are the Nansha Islands, and how far are they from the 
mainland? The big transport ship that took us from Zhanjiang 
Port on the Leizhou peninsula to the Nanshas sailed nonstop for 
more than 50 hours. The South China Sea in April and May was 
the honeymoon season of the year. The sea was as smooth as a 
mirror. Only school after school of flying fish occasionally 
jumping out of the water alongside the ship broke the monotony 
of the vast expanse of water and sea. According to a naval 
comrade who accompanied us, it was a rare good time of the year 
because, in a few days, the South Sea could become stormy and 
turbulent. 
  As we landed on the first island, the (Zhudi) reef, we saw a 
Chinese map circled with six big characters reading "Motherland 
in My Heart," in addition to rotating radar antennas atop white 
pillboxes. A Chinese couplet written with red paint on the two 
sides of the gate to pillboxes said: "Fulfill one's aspiration 
in the remotest corner of the earth by safeguarding the (Zhudi) 
reef; link one's heart to the motherland by forever defending 
the national gate." The island, a terraced reef, did not have a 
single inch of land above ground. Even at low tide, the terrace 
is still partially submerged. Naval officers and men, who are 
stationed year-round in the lone pillboxes surrounded by the 
immense sea, can neither watch TV nor listen to radio; and even 
a letter back home cannot be delivered smoothly. However, all 
fighters were full of patriotic enthusiasm. The wall papers and 
couplets put up in the pillboxes and flowers meticulously 
planted by fighters revealed their sentiment of affection for 
the reef, the sea, and the motherland. 
  Each and every reef stationed with officers and men had its 
own couplet. One of the entries to a couplet contest sponsored 
by the Fiery Cross Reef officers and men said: "The small reefs 
should not be taken lightly as their safeguarding concerns 3 
million square km of water; without the reefs, 200 million 
households will (?become defenseless)." In this way, the 
couplet revealed the lofty aspiration of officers and men in 
safeguarding the motherland's territorial rights and interests 
over the 3 million square km waters for the security of 200 
million households throughout the country. To officers and men 
guarding the reefs, the motherland is of paramount importance. 
The (Chihua) reef officers and men nicknamed their daily 
workout of running around the pillboxes the Nansha-Beijing 
10,000-li run. Officers and men stationed on other reefs 
responded by pledging to complete the distance of the run before 
the 45th founding anniversary of the PRC. 
  Although what officers and men saw from the pillboxes were 
a vast perennial expanse of sea, they never missed the solemn 
flag-raising ceremony even for a single day. They raised their 
hands in front of the flag and pledged to link the reefs with 
the motherland and defend the flag on the reefs. Wall and board 
papers put up inside the pillboxes were full poems written by 
fighters describing their noble sentiments. [passage omitted] 
  On the Fiery Cross Reef, political commissar (Zhang Wanhua) 
told us about martyr and first-class merit citation recipient 
(He Zhenghui): On the eve of the Spring Festival in 1993, when a 
squad was performing duty on the reef, the weather changed 
suddenly. The wind was blowing hard and the wave surging up the 
reef. Fighter (Zhang Yangmin), who was walking at the front, 
tripped and was swept off by a giant wave, falling into a 
trench. As (He) witnessed the scene, he bravely jumped into the 
trench and dragged his comrade-in-arms out of danger. (Zhang) 
was saved, but (He) was swept away by a strong wave into the 
ocean. He died at the tender age of 20. While sorting out the 
martyr's belongings, his comrades-in-arms discovered an 
unfinished letter. The letter said: Father, if your son would 
become a martyr for the motherland, you should use the pension 
to seek treatment for your bronchitis and Mother's rheumatic 
headache. The remaining money will definitely be not enough to 
help Elder Brother find a bride, but can be used to repair the 
roof. 
  As we listened to the soul-stirring story and saw the white 
pillboxes standing erect above the sea, we searched for the true 
meaning of patriotism in the Nansha Islands. The answer is 
found in the pillboxes and the sea.

<F P=106> [Second part of a serial report on the Spratley Islands, </F>
entitled "Cherish the Reefs With Deep Feelings" -- by RENMIN 
HAIJUN BAO reporter Li Xiangdong and station reporter Xiong 
Zhengyan; from the "News and Press Review" program] 
  [Text] People who have never been to the Nansha [Spratly] 
Islands usually use these words "bleak, desolate, and hardship" 
to describe the islands, but the Nansha that we have seen are 
full of vitality. As we landed at Dongmen Reef, what caught our 
eyes first were the words "Garden on the Sea," which somewhat 
surprised us. The small garden, whose diameter is slightly more 
than a meter long, was built with coral stones collected by the 
officers and men stationed on the reef from the sea. Decorated 
with coral stones shaped like flowers and deer horns, as well as 
shells of various types, the garden looks magnificent. Every 
pillbox in Nansha is like an ocean of flowers. Because of the 
high temperature and humidity and the high degree of alkalinity 
on the reef, the more than 20 types of flowers brought from the 
mainland by officers and men withered as they could not 
withstand the harsh environment. Only a small common plant 
survived the scorching sun and began to bloom in the soldiers' 
emptied food cans. The officers and men guarding the reef call 
them sunflowers. Before long, the sunflowers were blooming in 
all the pillboxes. After consulting each other over the 
telephone, the officers and men agreed to name this type of 
flower the Jiaohua of Nansha. In addition to sunflowers, other 
purple and pink flowers, pine trees, and green bamboos have 
taken roots at Nansha pillboxes. At (Yushu) Reef, there is a 
path lined with more than 10 green loquats. Cultivated from 
loquat seeds by the soldiers, these trees are now over 1 meter 
tall. 
  Compared with the mainland, life in the Nansha Island is 
especially hard. Fresh water and vegetables, in particular, are 
too precious. Every drop of drinking water has to be shipped 
from the mainland. Soldiers once had sores in their mouths 
because long periods without green vegetables. Some soldiers 
longed for green vegetables so much that they drew a pile of 
eggplants with purple color and a pile of tomatoes with red ink. 
However, these are things of the past, things from the early 
days when the soldiers took up their duty of guarding the reef. 
Now, at every pillbox we visited, we could see soilless 
vegetable plots made from discarded ammunition boxes, basins, 
food cans, as well as man-made mobile vegetable plots. In fact, 
this has turned every pillbox into the well-known Nanniwan 
Production Team. 
  The largest vegetable farm (words 
indistinct) measured nine fen [a unit of area equal to 66.666 
square meters]. The dirt was partly brought here by soldiers 
guarding the reef and partly provided by supply ships. The soil 
was nearly one foot thick. No less than 10 varieties, including 
water spinach, leaf mustard, three-colored amaranth, pakchoi, 
wax gourd, pumpkin, peas, and tomato, were in full growth. When 
Nansha's first home-grown cucumbers -- grown by soldier Wang 
Shanzhu in a cartridge box -- were ripe, soldiers on the reef 
held a special cucumber banquet. It was so precious that every 
soldier was reluctant to eat the piece distributed. Nowadays, 
soldiers are able to eat vegetables every other day, and each 
week they slaughter a self-raised pig. 
  The pillboxes, inhabited by soldiers on the reef, have also 
seen great changes. Soldiers proudly told us that what they 
inhabited were the third-generation high-foundation houses [gao 
jiao wu]; the first-generation houses had completely gone. We 
saw some second-generation houses, which were still retained. 
To build reinforced concrete high-foundation houses, soldiers 
guarding the reef have worked painstakingly under the sun; some 
have dedicated their lives. In building the third-generation 
houses, the resourceful soldiers designed and built devices that 
could hold water when it rains. Every square inch of the 
pillboxes was skillfully utilized to ameliorate the shortages of 
fresh water in Nansha. 
  Nanniwan on the sea crystallizes the soldier's dedicated 
service to the motherland. The miracles created on the vast sea 
by soldiers guarding the reef were footnotes to the poster on 
the reef: "Make the Reef Our Home, Guard the Territory in the 
Remotest Frontier With Pleasure!"

<F P=106> [Third part of a serial report on the Spratly Islands </F>
entitled "Dedication on the Nansha Islands" -- by station 
reporter Hu Zhanfan; from the "News and Press Review" program] 
  [Text] Many things which are considered ordinary and 
trivial on the mainland become very important on the Nansha 
[Spratly] Islands. For example, letters from one's family. 
More than once, we saw how fighters guarding the Nansha Island 
reefs beamed with joy when they received a letter from their 
family and how those who did not receive any mail became 
dejected. However, more than any other story, we heard 
family-letter-related stories about the silent dedication by 
soldiers guarding reefs at the remotest corner of China's 
territory. 
  There is a political instructor called Wu Guisong on the 
reefs. When he was 30, a baby boy was born to him. He named his 
baby Weiguo. He left home and returned to the reefs before his 
baby was one month old. Fighters have called him Weiguo's 
Father since then, and he would happily answer to this. 
Unfortunately, three months later he received a letter from his 
wife telling him that the baby had died of pneumonia four days 
after he left home. Although it was like a bolt out of the 
blue, Wu Guisong put up with the blow. He kept the bad news to 
himself and did not mention a word of it to others. He 
understood that any personal joys, anger, and sorrows would be 
contagious and would be shared by others in this small community 
far away from human habitation. He could not let his personal 
sorrow affect the general mood of the fighters. Whenever 
unknowing young fighters called him Weiguo's Father, he felt 
pain as if his heart had been stabbed with a knife, although he 
loudly responded to their calls with a smiling face. He shed 
his tears when he was alone. 
  More often than not, on the reefs, whoever received a letter 
from his family would read it aloud in public. One day, platoon 
leader Qian Renping received two letters from his family. One, 
dated 13 February, was sent by his wife, and the other, dated 17 
April, by his father. Gathering around him, fighters asked him 
to read aloud the letter from his Snow White as quickly as 
possible. He opened the letter and read aloud a paragraph: 
"Renping, I am in very good health. You have to go through 
hardships on the Nansha Islands. Take good care of yourself. I 
have been looking forward to receiving your letter for three 
full months. To date, I still have received none from you. 
This time, you must send me as many letters as you can write." 
Here, he stopped reading and folded the letter. He wanted to 
enjoy reading it at his ease sometime later. Then, he opened 
the other letter from his old father. After he had read a few 
lines, tears began welling in his eyes. His father told him 
that Qian's wife had contracted liver cancer and had passed away 
two months ago. His wife spent a whole afternoon writing the 
short letter to him on her deathbed. Qian Renping could not 
bear the sudden blow. However, when he received a notice to 
immediately return home by the next available vessel, he shook 
his head and said: "There are no previous arrangements. I 
cannot just go and leave my work unattended." Wiping tears off 
his face, he silently sat at his desk again. 
  In a pillbox on the Nansha Islands, we saw the following 
scene on a TV screen: A few fighters stood in the waist-deep 
seawater; holding guns in their hands and standing close to each 
other, they were defending a national flag. We also listened to 
the story about the deeds of Fighter Zhou Jianguo, who 
gloriously sacrificed himself during the construction of a 
pillbox, and we heard about the instances of asphalt felt 
melting and thermometers bursting under the scorching sun of the 
Nansha Islands. Officers and men repeatedly told us stories 
about such incidents. We found the story about the arduous 
struggle at sea unforgettable. In October 1993, Typhoon No. 20 
hit the main pillbox. High waves rolled over the rooftop of the 
three-story-high building. Erected structures and equipment 
lying on an area of 600 square meters of the construction site 
were swept away. Seeing the erected structures and equipment on 
the construction site disappearing before their eyes, the 
fighters wept. Swept away before their eyes were kitchen 
utensils, foodstuffs, materials, towels, soap, toothbrushes, 
toothpaste, clothes to be washed, and equipment for fighters' 
activities. What else could they use for food, clothing, and 
equipment on the construction site? The party branch decided 
that what had not been swept away by the typhoon must be used in 
a centralized way. Officers and men contributed for common use 
all the canned food, cigarettes, towels, and instant noodles 
that they had saved for themselves. Cans were used as bowls and 
washbasins as pans. Bamboo broomsticks which had not been used 
were split open and cut short for use as chopsticks. Two people 
took turns wearing three sets of clothes. The fighters received 
a cookie every other day. Despite such hardships, the fighters 
did not fail to perform their duties at their posts or to stand 
guard for 20 days in a row. 
  Such was the dedication by sentries at the remotest corner 
of 
China's territory. The spiritual force supporting them was, 
there is no doubt, the four large characters inscribed on the 
(Yushu) Reef of the Nansha Islands -- Long live the motherland.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 KYODO -- North Korean President Kim 
Il-song hopes that a historic summit meeting with his South 
Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam can be held in Pyongyang in 
August, the widow of former Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Miki 
said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Speaking with reporters at Beijing airport, Mutsuko Miki 
said 
she was invited to Pyongyang by the North Korean president on 
June 14 and met with him for two hours on Sunday. 
  "I don't remember clearly the date of the scheduled summit 
meeting that Kim Il-song referred to, but I believe he said 
August 17," Miki, 77, said. 
  The summit was first proposed by the North Korean president 
during talks with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 
Pyongyang late last week and relayed Saturday to South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam, who readily accepted the proposal. 
  The mention of the August date and Pyongyang is the first 
proposal by either side of a time and place for what could be a 
historic meeting. 
  The south has proposed a preparatory meeting for the summit 
on June 28 at the heavily armed border crossing at panmunjom and 
it is believed the North Korean side will put forward the August 
date at meeting, analysts said. 
  Kim Il-song was very upbeat in describing his meetings with 
Carter, which he called "very successful" and "in a very 
friendly atmosphere," Miki said. 
  "We would like to have more personnel exchanges with Japan 
and get along with Japan," she quoted Kim as saying, adding that 
he expressed a strong hope of establishing diplomatic ties with 
Japan. 
  Takeo Miki was prime minister from 1974 to 1976.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korean ministers at 
meetings this week will discuss the issue of economic 
cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) in anticipation of the summit meeting between the leaders 
of the two halves of the Korean peninsula. 
  Government officials said here today that the aim of the 
proposed consultations among various South Korean ministries was 
to promote intra-Korean economic exchange, which has been 
stalled due to the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
  The inter-Korean summit is likely to be held in the near 
future, with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam having accepted 
an invitation from DPRK President Kim Il-song conveyed to him by 
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter last Saturday [18 June]. 
  The officials said that the first stage of ministerial 
meetings will involve the National Unification Board (NUB), the 
Economic Planning Board (EPB) and the Trade, Industry and 
Resources Ministry. 
  More detailed consultations will be held after the summit 
and 
an ensuing meeting between the prime ministers of South Korea 
and the DPRK, they said. 
  South Korea's private sector in particular is expected to 
accelerate direct trade and joint investment with the DPRK, if 
the summit takes place and the obstacles to economic cooperation 
are removed, the officials added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam today ordered government departments to begin 
thorough preparations for a possible summit meeting between the 
two sides of the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim gave this directive following a ministerial meeting 
related to the unification of Korea, presided over by Deputy 
Prime Minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi 
Hong-ku here Monday [20 June]. 
  Seoul has proposed to Pyongyang to meet on June 28 to 
prepare 
for the summit, which will be the first in half century. 
  Chances for an inter-Korean summit are at an all-time high 
with the top leaders of South Korea and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) agreeing in principle to the meeting. 
  Kim Yong-sam accepted the proposal by DPRK President Kim 
Il-song through the mediation of former United States President 
Jimmy Carter last Saturday. 
  Carter was in South Korea and the DPRK from June 13 to 18 in 
"a private capacity" and exchanged views with Kim Yong-sam and 
Kim Il-song respectively on the Korean situation, including the 
nuclear issue in the DPRK. 
  Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to meet 
with 
him at any time, anywhere, without pre-conditions, and at an 
early date, told Carter that he will accept the offer "without 
any hesitation." 
  The South Korean Government has begun comprehensive 
preparations for this meeting by forming a working-level task 
force headed by vice-minister of the national unification board, 
Song Yong-tae. 
  His group is making a variety of preparations, and is 
engaged 
in discussions to gather more details such as the time and place 
for the summit meeting. 
  Observers here said that barring any unexpected developments 
an inter-Korean summit is likely to occur in the near future. 
It would be the first in the half-century of national division 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  The nuclear dispute and other major issues existing between 
the two sides could then be discussed, providing historic 
momentum toward progress in inter-Korean relations, the 
observers added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korea Monday [20 
June] proposed to meet with the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) on June 28 to discuss procedures for the 
inter-Korean summit meeting. 
  The proposal, contained in a message from South Korean Prime 
Minister Yi Yong-dok [name, title as received] to his DPRK 
counterpart Kang Song-san, said that a three-member delegation 
from each side headed by a deputy prime minister will meet at 
the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam accepted a proposal by 
DPRK President Kim Il-song to hold an inter-Korean summit 
through former president of the United States Jimmy Carter here 
last Saturday. 
  "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to the 
proposal as it is the most ideal event considering the inward 
and outward conditions of our country and the fervent wish of 
our people," Yi Yong-dok said in the message. 
  He noted that the burden on both South Korea and the DPRK 
has 
been getting heavier over the past half-century because of 
distrust and confrontation. 
  "We have been saying that a meeting of the top leaders is 
favorable if it would quickly dissolve the south-north tension 
aroused by the nuclear problem and settle a relationship of 
reconciliation and cooperation by opening the door to peaceful 
reunification of our country," Yi said. 
  Carter had visited South Korea and the DPRK from June 13 to 
18 as "a private capacity" and exchanged views with Kim Yong-sam 
and Kim Il-song respectively on the situation on the Korean 
peninsula, including the nuclear issues. 
  Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to meet him 
at any time, anywhere without pre-conditions at an early date, 
told Carter on June 18 that he will accept the offer "without 
any hesitation."

  [Text] Washington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said here today that there are some "hopeful signs" in 
resolving the crisis with the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) on nuclear issue. 
  "But we have to know what the facts are, and we will be 
attempting to determine that," Clinton told NBC program "Today". 
  Former President Jimmy Carter said in Washington yesterday 
he 
thought that the crisis with the DPRK is over and there are "no 
unanswered questions" following his talks with DPRK leaders on 
how to resolve the nuclear crisis. 
  "If North Korea wishes to talk and is willing to freeze 
their 
nuclear program," Clinton said, "then that would be a step 
forward." 
  "Now we have to verify that. So that's the question," 
Clinton stressed. 
  In answering a question, Clinton said that "I think what we 
have to do is to look to the present and the future and say we 
will evaluate words in terms of actions." 
  Clinton believed that the United States has the capacity, if 
the international inspectors and the monitoring equipment are 
going to be left in the DPRK, to evaluate whether the DPRK's 
nuclear program has been frozen.

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin sent a salute today to Chinese and foreign expeditions to 
Antarctica on the occasion of the winter solstice festival which 
will fall on Tuesday [21 June] in the southern hemisphere. 
  Jiang sent the cable message to mark the tenth anniversary 
of 
China's sending independent expeditions to Antarctica. 
  Following is the full text of Jiang's cable message: 
  "At the time when you are celebrating the winter solstice 
festival, I, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese 
people and in the name of myself, extend cordial regards for you 
scientists, engineers and other technical personnel working 
selflessly in the long polar night. I wish you a happy winter 
solstice festival. 
  "Antarctica is the last continent on earth that still 
remains 
desolate and wild. Holding high the banner of peace, 
cooperation and friendship, you are fighting against the wind, 
snow and cold and have made constant progress in the scientific 
expedition, thus making great contributions to exposing the 
secret of Antarctica, safeguarding the global ecological 
environment and promoting the common prosperity and progress of 
human society. 
  "Let me take this opportunity to salute expeditions from all 
countries who have contributed to probing into, studying and 
protecting Antarctica. 
  "The 1.1 billion Chinese people congratulate you for the 
abundant achievements you have already made and are looking 
forward to the even greater contributions you will make to 
peaceful utilization of Antarctica. 
  "May the winter go well for you and I wish you success in 
your work."

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese leader 
today expressed the hope that the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
(IPU) would continue to make efforts to safeguard world peace 
and promote the common development of mankind. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress 
(NPC) Standing Committee, made the remarks when he met the IPU's 
secretary-general, Pierre Cornillon, here today. 
  During the meeting, Qiao praised the IPU for its positive 
role in maintaining world peace, promoting mutual understanding, 
exchanges and friendship among the parliaments of different 
countries since its foundation more than a century ago. 
  Qiao said the world today is still experiencing complex and 
profound changes and to seek detente, cooperation, development 
and progress is the common desire of all peoples. He expressed 
the hope that the IPU would make further efforts for world peace 
and human development. 
  Qiao said that the NPC, as a member of the IPU, pays much 
attention to the role of the IPU and has taken part in its 
activities. 
  He told the IPU head that the NPC regards the exchanges with 
foreign parliaments and the mutual understanding and friendly 
relations with foreign countries, peoples and parliaments as a 
major task. 
  It was revealed today that during the fourth world 
conference 
on women, which will be held here early next year, the NPC 
Standing Committee and the IPU Secretariat will co-sponsor a 
meeting of parliamentarians. The NPC will sponsor the 96th IPU 
conference in 1996. 
  Qiao told the guest that China, as the host country of that 
conference, will work hard to secure the success of the 
conference. 
  Cornillon believed that the two conferences, with the 
efforts 
of the Chinese people, will be successful. He also appreciated 
the NPC's role within the IPU. 
  Earlier today, Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC 
Standing 
Committee, feted Cornillon and Christine Pintat, officer in 
charge of the women's program of the IPU. Zheng Yi, deputy 
secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, also had talks 
with Cornillon and his party.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "China Prepares to Begin Work on Gatt </F>
Protocol"] 
  [Text] China is bracing itself for a long-awaited protocol 
later this month on its re-entry into the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), according to a top Chinese official. 
  The draft protocol is to be submitted to the 17th session of 
the Gatt Working Party on China in Geneva. 
  The meeting could be a watershed in the prolonged 
negotiating 
process if it can clinch a comprehensive draft protocol on 
China's rights and obligations in the world trade body. 
  Gatt Director General Peter Sutherland has said the draft 
protocol must be available by June if China wants to rejoin Gatt 
and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) before January 1, 1995. 
  "We're pleased that at long last we will have a 
comprehensive 
document to work on, said Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). 
  "This by itself is a breakthrough in the negotiations," he 
said. 
  China applied to rejoin Gatt in 1986, when the Uruguay Round 
of Gatt talks were launched. 
  But a comprehensive protocol has failed to be shaped so far, 
due to argument over what steps China would need to take after 
re-entry. 
  Some Gatt members have demanded that China fulfill all Gatt 
rules before rejoining the world free trade body. 
  But Peter Sutherland described the request as unrealistic 
and 
unreasonable. 
  A positive signal came recently when the United States 
submitted its version of a draft protocol to Gatt following one 
by the European Union earlier this year. 
  The move is described by Long as helping to clear the way 
for 
preparing a comprehensive text to be discussed in Geneva. 
  The U.S. has taken note of China's demand for a transitional 
period during which it could fully meet Gatt requirements. 
  Long said China will try to be as flexible as possible in 
the 
coming rounds of negotiations. 
  "We will accept demands (from other Gatt members) only if 
they comply with the gradual process of China's economic reforms 
and its current economic level," he said. 
  During a round of Sino-U.S. negotiations in Washington 
earlier this month, the U.S. made many requests which included 
expanding Chinese market access concerning trade in services and 
allowing more companies to deal in foreign trade in China. 
  Long said China will consider them and accept those that are 
reasonable. 
  He insisted re-entry to Gatt is only part of China's 
economic 
reform plan. 
  And he said China wants nothing that would risk economic 
development and social stability He said if Western nations come 
down too hard on China, progress towards a market economy will 
be disrupted. 
  Long praised Dorothy Dwoskin, the U.S. assistant trade 
representative, and her team for their hard work in Washington 
earlier this month to narrow the differences between China and 
the U.S. over the terms for China's re-entry. 
  He said the bilateral talks were positive and constructive, 
as they were free from political interference after U.S. 
President Bill Clinton decided on May 26 to renew China's 
most-favoured-nation status and delink it with human rights. 
  But Long said future difficulties may arise in the 
negotiations. 
  "So long as we have good will and a realistic approach, we 
can overcome many more difficulties," he emphasized.

  [Text] Moscow, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Economic 
Relations Minister Oleg Davydov is to hold talks with U.S. 
officials in Washington on the removal of obstacles in bilateral 
trade-economic relations, the official ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY 
said today. 
  The talks, scheduled to begin on Tuesday [21 June] within 
the 
framework of the joint Russian-U.S. Commission known as the 
Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission, will also focus on major U.S. 
investments in Russia. 
  Before leaving for Washington on Sunday night, Davydov told 
reporters that in 1993, the two countries' trade turnover 
increased by 1.2 times from 1,992 to 4.3 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Russia's exports increased considerably, trebling from the 
1992 figure to 1,997 million dollars last year, while its 
imports diminished from 2883.7 million dollars in the same year 
to 2303.7 million dollars in 1993. 
  This enabled the two nations to reduce the traditional 
deficit in mutual turnover to a minimum, the minister pointed 
out. 
  He said that statistics for the first quarter of this year 
make it possible to conclude that this positive trend in the 
development of trade between Russia and the United States will 
continue in 1994. 
  The achievement of an approximate parity in trade between 
the 
two countries was largely due to the sharp cut in grain 
purchases, which earlier accounted for at least one half of all 
Russian imports from the United States, Davydov said. 
  As to the remaining obstacles in bilateral trade relations, 
he stated that they include the low competitiveness of many 
Russian goods, the barriers to exports of high-tech goods from 
the United States and the severe anti-dumping legislation. 
  Investment cooperation is playing an increasingly important 
role in economic interaction between the two countries, 
according to the Russian minister. U.S. firms are in the lead 
among Western investors seeking to set up joint ventures in 
Russia. 
  The Russian official said that there are 1,400 joint 
ventures 
in the country with U.S. capital investment, reaching nearly 400 
million U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "UN Gives `Security' a Global Definition"] </F>
  [Text] Security as used by the media often conveys 
protection from external aggression -- protection from nuclear 
annihilation, for example -- or it suggests blue-helmeted 
peacekeepers of the UN whose job it is to keep warring factions 
apart. 
  In a more fundamental sense, however, security means safety 
from some more common threats to human existence: hunger, 
disease, crime and repression. It means protection from sudden 
and damaging disruptions in the pattern of our daily lives 
whether the disruptions strike our homes, jobs, communities or 
the environment. 
  This is the wider concept of "security" embodied in the 
Human 
Development Report '94 of the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP). 
  At a recent UNDP workshop on the report held in Dhaka, 
Bangladesh, some 50 participants from East and South Asia 
maintained that the search for human security lies in 
development, not in arms. 
  Participants, including delegates from Bangladesh, China, 
India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Vietnam, 
Cambodia and Thailand, discussed the new role of the United 
Nations in meeting humanity's agenda not only for peace but also 
for development. 
  According to the report, development co-operation, which has 
tended to be limited to financial aid, should be broadened to 
include technical assistance and marketing strategies. 
  Dr. Mahbub ul Haq [name as published], special adviser to 
the 
UNDP administrator in New York, said the report is aimed at 
widening the UN's attention from only economic development. 
<H5>  Soaring Population </H5>
  In consideration of the graver challenge threatening human 
security, a new development pattern is required that puts people 
at the centre of development and regards economic growth as a 
means, not an end. 
  According to the report, despite all of man's technological 
breakthroughs, he still cannot meet primary needs in many parts 
of the world. A fifth of the developing world's population goes 
hungry every night, a quarter lacks access to potable drinking 
water and a third lives in a state of abject poverty. 
  With these massive problems unresolved, the critical 
question 
of humanity's ability to survive on an environmentally fragile 
planet has become ever more urgent. The world's soaring 
population only adds to the urgency. 
  Demographers forecast in the report that by the middle of 
the 
next century, the world population may double while the world's 
economy quadruples. 
  At the same time, it is estimated that productivity of food 
production needs to triple since the source base for sustainable 
agriculture is being eroded. 
  The world's increasing energy requirements also must be met. 
But even at today's level of usage, the burning of fossil fuels 
threaten the global climate. The devastation of the world's 
forests and the loss of fauna wealth and diversity continue 
relentlessly. 
  "Against this backdrop of human distress" the report says, 
"we must seek a new concept of human security in the decades 
ahead." 
  The report attempts to propose a new model of sustainable 
human development that can guard the expanding frontiers of 
human security and provide a new framework of development 
co-operation that unites humanity with a more equitable sharing 
of global economic opportunities and responsibilities. 
  The report also put forward suggestions for the World Summit 
for Social Development scheduled for March 1995 in Copenhagen, 
Denmark. 
  The establishment of an Economic Security Council within the 
United Nations is a new, ambitious idea of UNDP. 
  Further, the UN agency "urges the international community to 
undertake a comprehensive review of the existing framework of 
international development, and, in this connection, to undertake 
studies on the practicability of such measures as establishing a 
global social safety net, introducing a world income tax, and 
creating a tax on foreign exchange movements as a potential 
source of financing for a more effective United Nations." 
  According to a UNDP official in India, China has made the 
most rapid progress in human development in Asia, followed by 
India and Bangladesh. 
  Over a long period of time, China has invested considerably 
in human development. Despite China's relatively low per capita 
income, it falls into the medium human development index (HDI) 
-- ranking 94th in the world in 1992. HDI takes longevity, 
education and standard of living into account in its evaluation. 
  Yang Qingwei, a Chinese participant in the workshop, said 
that the picture of social development in developing countries 
is more or less the same. 
  "The solutions to their problems, however, is not 
necessarily 
the same," said Yang, deputy director of the Social Development 
Department under the State Planning Commission. 
<H5>  Robust Growth </H5>
  The poorest of nations should depend on their own domestic 
economic reforms, supported by foreign aid. 
  Alluding to China, Yang reported that the past 15 years of 
reform and opening to the outside world have witnessed robust 
economic growth. The social sector, unfortunately, has 
developed slowly. Regional economic imbalance has increased. 
  Furthermore, the access to education varies from region to 
region. On average, 97 per cent of the nation's school-age 
children go to school. But the figure is low in the remote, 
poverty-stricken areas. 
  "China's social development mechanism fails to facilitate 
the 
transition to a market economy," Yang said. 
  He maintained that carefully directed State intervention 
will 
be required to ensure steadier human development and equitable 
distribution of social services because the market often doesn't 
do a good job directing resources in the social sector. 
  Yang called for reform of such social sector systems as 
pensions, unemployment compensation and industrial injuries 
compensation in order to achieve an improved level of social 
integration in the market economy. 
  China is sketching a blueprint for social development from 
1995 to 2000. Local governments, for example, are required to 
define their lowest level of poverty and minimum wage. 
  Yang also reiterated that the demands of human development 
today should be linked with the exigencies of development 
tomorrow. He said governments should consider how decisions 
affecting the environment and natural resources will impact 
future generations to ensure they have opportunities similar to 
the ones previous generations have enjoyed.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The Airport Committee 
of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), will be held 
Friday [24 June] this week. 
  This was announced by the senior representatives from both 
sides of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the end of 
their first day meeting, which started at 09:30 [0130 GMT] this 
morning and lasted for more than four hours. 
  After the meeting, Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the 
Chinese team of the JLG, said, "we had a useful meeting this 
morning and will continue our talks tomorrow and in the 
following day." 
  His British counterpart H.L. Davies said this morning's 
meeting covered a wide range of subjects and achieved "excellent 
progress". 
  In reply to a question that whether the Chinese and British 
sides have a gap on the airport issue, he said, "I don't think 
the gap is too great. I think it is achievable."

  [Text] Hong Kong, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- The 29th meeting of 
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG] opened here today 
after a half-year suspension. The two sides agreed to hold an 
airport committee meeting this week. 
  Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese side, said 
prior to the meeting: There are only a little over three years 
left between now and 1997, and there are a lot of problems for 
the JLG to discuss. The JLG should speed up its work; however, 
that requires efforts from both sides. He said the Chinese side 
would bring up some subjects for discussion by the JLG at this 
meeting, and the objective is to ensure Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. 
  Today's meeting lasted more than four hours. After it was 
over, the two sides announced they had agreed to hold an Airport 
Committee meeting of the Sino-British JLG on 24 June. 
  It has been reported that the current meeting will last 
three 
days, and the two sides will discuss such subjects as the 
military land issue, localization of laws, public servants' 
retirement pensions, and the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region] passport issue. The previous JLG 
meeting was held in London from 7 to 9 December last year.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] China yesterday stepped up its attack on a move by 
the Government to increase its openness, claiming the proposal 
violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the unilateral move 
involved "major changes to the operation of government 
departments in Hong Kong, which is detrimental to Hong Kong's 
smooth transition". 
  Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang disagreed and said: 
"We do not see that there is any contravention of the Joint 
Declaration". Mrs Chan on Thursday unveiled a code of practice 
detailing what information the public would have access to, 
although the code has no legal backing. It is not expected to 
be fully implemented until 1996. The proposal, she said was 
"simply a further move towards making the whole machinery more 
transparent in accordance with the wishes of the community". 
  A government spokesman said the measures would "contribute 
to 
a smooth transition by responding effectively to developing 
public expectations". He said: "It is premature to make 
specific judgments about the effect on the operation of 
government. But a central objective will be to improve the 
efficiency of the civil service and enhance the accountability 
of the Government." 
  Supporters of the call for a freedom of information act 
rejected the measures as inadequate. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said "the so-called 
package of measures to further enhance the public's access to 
information" involved major changes over how the executive 
branch would be operated. Those matters should be discussed by 
the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) in accordance with 
the 1997 agreement, he said. 
  "The unilateral move by the British Hong Kong Government 
without prior consultation and agreement with China is 
unacceptable to the Chinese side," Mr Shen said. The Joint 
Declaration says the JLG should discuss matters relating to the 
smooth transfer of government in 1997. 
  A senior mainland official insisted that the proposal would 
bring about a "major impact" on the existing internal operation 
of the Government. "To say the least, it will adversely affect 
the efficiency of the Government," he said. 
  "At present, the Government can do whatever it wants to 
without having to publicise information. Under the proposal, it 
will have to prepare a set of information that the public can 
have access to. 
  "We have to take on board the fact that there's only three 
years to go (before 1997). It will increase uncertainty if you 
bring about a lot of changes to the system." The official said 
the move was a government plan to institute changes to the 
system of the post-1997 government. 
  United Democrat Martin Lee Chu-ming said he could not see 
any 
provision in the Joint Declaration that would not allow Hong 
Kong to set up a human rights commission and access to 
information rules. Mr Lee said China's reaction reflected a 
different interpretation of law. The party yesterday urged 
Governor Chris Patten to give the go-ahead for the access to 
information law. 
  Legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai urged China to explain how 
the Joint Declaration had been violated. She said Hong Kong had 
been promised the principle of "one country, two systems" under 
which it should be allowed to introduce policies according to 
the society's needs.

  [Text] The government has vowed not to back down on moves 
to improve public access to official information despite China's 
confirmation yesterday it would dissolve the new measures after 
1997. Meanwhile legal experts have told the government the 
package of measures does not go far enough nor comply with Hong 
Kong's Bill of Rights. 
  Secretary for Home Affairs Michael Suen told the Sunday Hong 
Kong Standard yesterday that it was up to Beijing to bring 
forward its concerns to the government. "I think the initiative 
does not lie with us," Mr Suen said. "We have taken the first 
step and informed them." 
  The government announced last week it would give individuals 
access to their personal files and establish a British-style 
code of practice covering the release of official data. But 
Chinese officials -- who were not consulted over the move -- 
lashed out on Friday, warning the measures breached the Joint 
Declaration. Deputy director of Xinhua News Agency Cheung Kwok 
Hung reiterated last night that China had not been consulted on 
the proposals, which Beijing would dissolve after 1997. "If 
there is such a great change of policy without discussion with 
the Chinese side, we will not accept it," he said. 
  Mr Suen played down the latest rift in Sino-British 
relations 
and said consultations would resolve the problem. "I think all 
they (China) are saying is that they need to be consulted," Mr 
Suen said. "That should allay any fears. It is a whole package 
of measures which will improve the efficiency of the civil 
service, something I believe both governments want." 
  The government's package, which does not go so far as to 
give 
Hong Kong people a legal right to obtain information on 
government operations, has angered key backers of Freedom of 
Information legislation who say the proposals are toothless. 
Senior Hong Kong lecturer in constitutional law Nihal 
Jayawickrama said Section 16 of the Bill of Rights gives people 
the right to seek information. "When you create the right to 
seek information from the government there is a corresponding 
right by the government to provide that information," he said. 
Dr Jayawickrama said there would be grounds for a court battle 
if an individual was refused information by the government. 
"But the government is securely protected by those exorbitant 
(court) fees," he said. 
  Mr Suen disagreed. "There is no obligation for an unwilling 
party to give information," he said.

  [Text] A delay in the completion of the formalities for 
some amendments to the Letter Patents and Royal Instructions has 
made no impact on the validity of the laws passed since February 
last year the Government said. 
  The SUNDAY MORNING POST reported yesterday that, as a result 
of a clerical error in the Foreign Office, changes allowing John 
Swaine to replace the Governor as President of the Legislative 
Council [Legco] last year had not undergone the essential steps 
of becoming law -- believed to include being signed by the Queen 
-- when they were gazetted on February 18 and 19, 1993. 
Constitutional experts said this suggested the gazettal was 
invalid and would mean that Mr Swaine lacked the legal authority 
to preside over Legco, raising doubts about the validity of the 
125 laws passed since then. 
  The laws include the two Budgets, the first part of the 
1994/95 electoral reforms, the Western Harbour Crossing 
Ordinance and the Boundary and Election Commission Ordinance. 
  But a Government spokesman said yesterday the amendments 
were 
"approved by Her Majesty at the Privy Council meeting on 
December 19, 1992". It is understood that the Queen approved 
the amendments in draft form only. 
  The spokesman said: "Although the two sets of amendments 
were published in the Hong Kong Gazette before the residual 
formalities were completed, Her Majesty's Government was 
satisfied that this would have no effect on the validity of any 
acts by the Hong Kong Legislative Council." 
  A legal source said the issue was about "the legal meaning 
of 
an amendment being made to the Letters Patent and the Royal 
Instructions". 
  The British Government's position was that it accepted the 
Queen's signature on the draft as sufficient. 
  The source said it remained to be seen whether this was a 
correct statement of the law and it was unacceptable for doubts 
to linger over the effectiveness of amendments to the Letters 
Patents. 
  Legislators are set to query officials of the Constitutional 
Affairs Branch on the issue today. 
  United Democrat chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming said he wanted 
a 
clarification from the administration. He noted that anyone 
with an interest in one of the 125 laws could challenge their 
validity which would be disastrous. 
  His colleague Simon Ip Sik-on said they had to get the full 
details first. 
  "I don't think it is a simple issue," he said, adding that 
it 
was unwise to rush to conclusions.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou will travel to Washington on Saturday to inform US 
officials that Taiwan no longer intends to pay for the 
repatriation of illegal Mainland Chinese immigrants ferried by 
Taiwan boats to the United States or to neighboring countries 
from which the immigrants can enter the United States, a local 
newspaper said Monday [20 June]. 
  UNITED DAILY NEWS reported that after attending the National 
Association of Attornies General 1994 summer meeting in San 
Antonio, Texas Wednesday through Saturday, Ma will fly to 
Washington, where he will hold talks with US officials about the 
two recent incidents where Taiwan was forced to pay to have 
mainland immigrants repatriated from Guatemala. 
  A Taiwan fishing boat carrying more than 100 mainland 
illegal 
immigrants last August had sailed straight for Guatemala, and 
one carrying more than 130 mainland immigrants in April was 
intercepted by the US Coast Guard off the US coast and towed to 
Guatemala, where it had been headed anyway. Guatemala 
repatriated all the immigrants and crew. 
  Ma will argue that because the illegal immigrants had come 
from Mainland China and that their final destination was the 
United States, the issue of repatriation should have been solely 
between the United States and Mainland China, and that the cost 
of repatriation should have been borne by the owners of the 
Taiwan ships. 
  The skippers of the two boats had promised the mainland 
immigrants that they could gain easier access to the United 
States through Guatemala, which maintains diplomatic ties with 
Taiwan. 
  An official with Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Ministry said that 
Taiwan has cooperated with the US by allowing its Coast Guards 
to inspect the ships in international waters. 
  He said that though Taiwan has no obligation to pay for the 
cost of repatriating the mainlanders, Taiwan agreed to do so in 
the end after pressure from the United States. 
  He said that the ministry agreed to pay for political and 
humanitarian reasons, and also to protect the image of the 
nation. 
  The official noted that both ships had their operating 
licenses revoked a long time ago. The boat caught in April had 
had its operating license revoked in March, but had continued to 
operate as a driftnet fishing boat, he said. 
  Ma is also expected to discuss with the US side a US request 
for assistance in cracking down on international drug rings and 
the possible signing of extradition agreements.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Vice Foreign Affairs 
Minister Chen Hsi-fan said on Monday (920 June] that the 
government has informed Washington about its intention to change 
the name of its representative office in the United States, but 
that the U.S. side so far has not replied concretely to Taipei's 
proposal. 
  Chen made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan joint committee 
meeting when Democratic Progressive Party legislator Hsu [words 
indistinct] questioned him on the designation of the office -- 
currently the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, 
or CCNAA -- while they were discussing Taiwan's plans to sign a 
copyright agreement with the United States through the office. 
Chen said the government has proposed that the name of the 
office be changed to the "Taipei Representative Office," but Hsu 
said "Taiwan Representative Office" would be a more appropriate 
name. 
  Citing Taiwan's representative offices in Japan and Britain, 
both of which use "Taipei Representative Office," Chen said it 
would be easier to obtain U.S. approval to use "Taipei 
Representative Office" because of the lack of formal relations 
between the two countries. As Taipei is the capital of the 
Republic of China [ROC], it is logical to use "Taipei" to 
designate the nation's representative offices overseas, Chen 
noted.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- The Qiandao [Chien-tao] 
Lake incident has not been cleared up and justice not served 
even though Mainland Chinese authorities on Sunday executed the 
three men convicted in the killings of 32 people, including 24 
Taiwan tourists, at the scenic lake in Zhejiang Province in 
southeastern China on March 31, a mainland affairs official said 
Monday [20 June]. 
  Su Chi, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, 
criticized the mainland's handling of the case, calling it 
"improper." He said many suspicious aspects about the case have 
not been resolved. 
  A news release issued by the mainland's Hangzhou 
Intermediate 
People's Court said Wu Lihong, Yu Aijun and Hu Zhihan, who were 
convicted last week for robbing and setting fire to the tourists 
and crewmen, were executed at 10:30 A.M. Sunday. 
  The intermediate court sentenced the trio to death for 
robbery and murder on June 12. The Hangzhou High Court approved 
the death sentences Saturday. 
  Many family members of the Taiwan tourists killed in the 
disaster insisted that the crimes could not have been committed 
by only three people, adding that the case is not likely to ever 
be resolved now that the three men have been executed.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- The government spokesman on 
Monday [20 June] expressed disappointment at the final result of 
the March 31 lake Qiandao [Chien-tao] murder of 24 Taiwan 
tourists. 
  Jason Hu, the director-general of the Government Information 
Office, said that because many questions regarding the case 
remain unresolved, it is "an unsettled case with the truth 
behind it having no chance of being uncovered." 
  After a brief hearing on Sunday affirming the sentence of 
the 
three men convicted for the murders, the men were executed. 
  "The government is extremely disappointed at the result," Hu 
said while meeting a group of journalists from Hong Kong. 
  He said that Beijing cannot call an end to the case because 
two important issues remain unresolved -- compensation for the 
relatives of the victims and how the mainland will ensure the 
future safety of Taiwan tourists in the mainland. 
  He accused Beijing of trying to cover up the truth behind 
the 
killings not long after the crime occurred, thus destroying the 
credibility of its later explanation. 
  Hu advised Beijing that honesty is the best policy. 
  Hu said that exchanges between the two sides should be 
continued even though the incident has inflicted grave damage to 
cross-strait relations.

manager of the Fujian provincial branch of the China Youth 
Travel Service, has entrusted Steven Lin, general manager of 
Soaring Travel Service based in Taiwan, to pass 2.95 million 
yuan (330,000 U.S. dollars) of insurance payments to the 
families of 24 Taiwanese victims of the Qiandao Lake tragedy. 
  The compensation is being paid by the People's Insurance 
Company of China. 
  The family of each victim is receiving 120,000 yuan (13,790 
U.S. dollars) under travel accident insurance and 3,000 yuan 
(345 U.S. dollars) for luggage loss compensation. The insurance 
was provided by the Fujian provincial branch of the China Youth 
Travel Service, which organized the group tour together with the 
Soaring Travel Service. 
  The agreement on the insurance indemnity was signed on 
Saturday [18 June] in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian 
Province, by General Manager Cai Yuan and General Manager Steven 
Lin. 
  The 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew members were 
murdered on a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake, a major tourist 
attraction in east China's Zhejiang Province, on March 31 this 
year by three robbers. 
  The three robbers were executed Sunday after going through 
all legal procedures.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- The research panel under 
the National Unification Council (UNC) [as received] will meet 
Wednesday [22 June] to discuss ways to promote mutual trust 
between the two sides of the Taiwan strait, a presidential 
office spokesman said Tuesday. 
  This will be the first time the UNC research panel has met 
since the March 31 Qiandao lake travel disaster in Mainland 
China, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered, said Raymond 
Tai, deputy secretary-general to the president. 
  "We hope all UNC researchers will pool their wisdom to work 
out ways to boost cross-strait mutual trust and rapprochement," 
Tai, himself a UNC member, told a regular presidential news 
conference. 
  The UNC is an advisory body under the presidential office 
that helps formulate the country's policy and blueprint for 
China's unification. 
  After more than four decades of separation, Tai said, Taiwan 
and the mainland lack mutual understanding and trust even though 
bilateral civilian exchanges have increased in recent years. 
  As a result, he said, cross-strait relations have been full 
of suspicions and misunderstandings, which resulted in bilateral 
ties coming to an abrupt halt in the aftermath of the Qiandao 
lake tragedy. 
  Tai said President Li declared in his new year's message 
that 
1994 will be the year for Taiwan and the mainland to forge 
mutual understanding and trust to pave the way for future 
cross-strait cooperation. 
  "We hope mainland authorities will make a goodwill response 
to Li's call for the well-being of all Chinese people," Tai 
said, adding that maintaining steady, peaceful relations is in 
the interest of both sides. 
  He also said Li is concerned about the recent floods in 
southern China and has ordered relevant government agencies to 
study ways of getting relief aid to the victims there. 
  Tai refused comment on a wave of sharp personal attacks on 
Li 
launched by the mainland media in recent days, saying the 
presidential office would not respond to such criticism. 
  The diplomat-turned spokesman said the Republic of China 
[ROC] has never changed its ultimate national goal of promoting 
China's reunification. 
  While seeking to expand its diplomatic frontiers, Tai said, 
the ROC will continue to forge good will and rapprochement with 
the mainland. 
  The ROC has unveiled the national unification guidelines to 
promote the "phased" development of cross-strait ties and 
eventual national unification, Tai noted.

  [Text] Taiwan June 17 (CNA) -- The Supreme Court on Friday 
[17 June] turned back the second appeal of Chang Win-lung who 
was sentenced to nine years for hijacking a passenger aircraft 
from Mainland China to Taiwan last year. 
  Chang hijacked a Boeing 737 with 63 passengers and nine 
crewmembers on board to the island on June 24 with a toy gun and 
a knife. He immediately surrendered to police upon landing at 
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. 
  Chang was sentenced to 12 years in jail but had his prison 
term reduced to nine years in his first appeal to the High Court. 
  Taiwan is currently holding 15 mainlanders who have forced 
airliners to Taiwan since April 1993. Fourteen have been given 
jail terms of up to 13 years. The 15th is still on trial. 
  Twelve mainland Chinese airliners have been hijacked to 
Taiwan since April last year, with the latest occurring when a 
man forced a Boeing 737 with 131 passengers and eight 
crewmembers on board to Taiwan on June 6. 
  Taipei has charged Beijing of deliberately allowing the 
hijackings to take place, likely in a scheme to test Taiwan's 
air defenses.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan has decided to 
provide NT [new Taiwan] $10 million (US$370,370) worth of food 
and medicine to Mainland China to help flood victims there. 
  "The purchase of relief materials is expected to be 
completed 
in a week and forwarded to the mainland," said Chang Sung-mao, 
secretary-general of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of 
China [ROC]. 
  Chang said he had contacted Sun Bochiu and Qu Zhe, vice 
presidents of the Red Cross Society's mainland chapter, upon 
learning of the recent floods. 
  "They told me that the damage brought by the floods is 
serious and expressed hope that Taiwan can lend help," Chang 
said. 
  According to foreign wire-service reports, 438 people have 
been killed and 6,470 others injured in six provinces in south 
China over the past 12 days, with Guangdong and Hunan Provinces 
being hardest hit. In addition, 480,000 houses have been 
destroyed and 3 million hectares of rice paddies washed away, 
with total property losses estimated at US$2 billion.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu has ended his American tour and flown to the Vatican 
for a visit, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said Tuesday 
[21 June]. 
  Chien is the first Republic of China [ROC] foreign minister 
to visit the Vatican in more than 10 years. The Vatican is the 
only European country that maintains diplomatic relations with 
the ROC. 
  During his stay in the city-state, Chien will chair an 
annual 
meeting of ROC officials stationed in Europe to review their 
work over the past year and to chart new courses for future 
work. Chien will then visit several European countries with 
which the ROC does not have formal ties, the official said. He, 
however, declined to reveal Chien's itinerary and with which 
European officials Chien plans to meet. "Chien will brief the 
press on his European tour after he returns on July 4," said the 
official, who requested anonymity. 
  Chien left for the U.S. on June 15 to attend a seminar in 
Beaver Creek, Colorado on major international concerns at the 
invitation of former U.S. President Gerald Ford. After the 
meeting, Chien visited his married daughter, who lives in the 
United States. He left for the Vatican Monday (American time).

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan is likely to export 
208 Ching Kuo jets, also known as Indigenous Defense Fighters 
(IDFs) to foreign countries between 1997 and 2010, General Lin 
Wen-li, director of the Aero Industry Development Center (AIDC), 
said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  The exports, if achieved, would give Taiwan a 12-percent 
share of the world market of IDF-type fighters, Lin, formerly 
commander-in-chief of the Air Force, said. He said that it is 
the goal of the AIDC to export the locally made aircraft. 
"Although it's surely the way the AIDC has to go, an export 
license from the United States and permit from the government 
are still necessary." 
  The AIDC, with technological assistance from the United 
States, is producing two IDFs monthly. The cooperative 
relationship calls for Taiwan to get American approval before it 
can sell the aircraft abroad. He said that a squadron of 24 
IDFs will be delivered to the Air Force as scheduled by the end 
of this year, greatly beefing up Taiwan's air defense capability. 
  Each IDF costs US$24 million to make, but Lin said that 
could 
be lowered to US$22 million in the future with accumulated 
experience and improved operations of the AIDC. Lin said the 
AIDC is responsible for designing and producing the bodies of 
the IDFs, 50 percent of its generators and less than [word 
indistinct] percent of its electronic equipment, with the 
remaining parts being supplied by the United States. He said 
that although the local content rate could be raised further in 
the long run, that goal would be difficult to achieve anytime 
soon under the agreement reached with the United States. 
  He said that several foreign aircraft producers, including 
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing of the U.S., British Aerospace plc 
and Dassault of France, have approached the AIDC about the 
possibility of joint production of commercial planes even though 
the AIDC at the moment is incapable of making such planes. Lin 
said, however, that the AIDC will aggressively seek to sell 
components and parts or establish relationships with foreign 
airplane makers to jointly develop commercial aircraft. 
  The AIDC, formerly controlled by the Cheng-shan Institute of 
Science and Technology, will soon become the first state-run 
company under the Defense Ministry.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- The economy is expected to 
flash a green light in May for the sixth month in a row, 
according to a preliminary index used by the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) to measure Taiwan's 
business activity. The CEPD estimated that the index would 
stand at 26 for May -- about the same level as April. 
  The CEPD, Taiwan's highest economic planning agency, uses a 
five-color rating system to measure economic prospects. A red 
light means the economy is overheated, yellow-red signals brisk 
economic growth, green indicates steady expansion, yellow-blue 
shows economic slowdown, and blue means recession. 
  A CEPD official said despite lackluster production 
capability 
and exports for the month, the economy would get a green light 
on the strength of the booming stock market.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan's economy is 
expected to grow 6.26 percent in the second half of this year, 
compared with an estimated 5.52 percent for the first half year, 
the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research reported Tuesday [21 
June]. 
  A host of factors, including stronger exports, the 
depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar, lower bank lending rates, 
and ongoing public-development projects, will push up the 
overall economic growth in the second half of the year, leading 
to a growth rate for the year of 5.9 percent, institute 
researchers said. An even brighter picture is predicted for 
1995 if growth in exports and private investment, among other 
sectors, continues, the researchers said. The institute also 
said that the private sectors will fare much better economically 
than the government in coming months. 
  The growth in private consumption is expected to increase 
7.4 
percent in the second half year, compared with a drop of 0.56 
percent for the government. Private investment should jump by 
12.65 percent, while public investment financed by the 
government will grow a mere 1.73 percent during the same period. 
Meanwhile, service and merchandise exports are expected to 
increase 7.38 percent while imports should jump 7.34 percent, 
the institute said. 
  The institute also predicted that Taiwan's consumer and 
wholesale prices will surge 3.77 percent and 1.93 percent, 
respectively, in the second half of the year.

  [Text] Taipei, June 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan will open its 
service markets wider to foreign competitors in exchange for a 
longer period of time for adjustment of its farm-trade 
regulatory system with a view to facilitating its entry into the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), senior government 
officials said Friday [17 June]. 
  The decision was made Thursday during a meeting of a 
cabinet-level task force responsible for working out the 
government's GATT negotiation strategy and coordinating 
different views of different government agencies on GATT-related 
issues, the officials said. 
  "Further liberalization of service industries will benefit 
our bids to join GATT and to become a regional operation center 
in East Asia," said Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, who chaired the panel meeting. 
  Hsiao said the government is working on a list of services 
to 
be open to foreign competitors after Taiwan joins GATT. "The 
list will cover items required by GATT and our major trade 
partners," Hsiao noted, adding that the list will be finalized 
at the end of June. 
  "Taiwan will benefit from the service-market opening, as 
free 
competition will speed up progress in our service sector," Hsiao 
explained. "Moreover, we hope greater liberalization in this 
field will increase our bargaining chips in farm-trade 
negotiations with GATT members." 
  Taiwan has agreed to remove some nontariff restrictions on 
farm trade, such as area and quota restrictions, Hsiao said. 
"Nevertheless, we hope we'll be allowed to keep such 
restrictions for a specified period of time for some major 
agricultural items to enable our farmers to adapt themselves to 
market-opening challenges," he added. 
  The interministerial task force also reached on Thursday 
several other groundbreaking decisions that are expected to 
accelerate Taiwan's accession to the Geneva-based world trade 
regulatory body, said Huang Yen-chao, director-general of the 
Board of Foreign Trade. 
  Among others, Huang said, the Ministry of Finance will 
within 
two months work out a detailed plan for restructuring the 
country's decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly system in line 
with GATT regulations. 
  The government will further lower tariff rates for some 
agricultural and industrial products to meet the demand of some 
GATT contracting parties, Huang said. 
  Taiwan will also start to negotiate with GATT members the 
opening of its public construction and procurement projects to 
foreign bidders and is determined to sign a multilateral 
agreement on such projects after it enters GATT, Huang said. 
  "We'll inform GATT authorities of these new decisions next 
week so that the GATT working party screening Taiwan's 
membership application can set the agenda for its next meeting 
scheduled for late July," Huang explained. 
  The working party has already held five multilateral 
meetings 
to discuss Taiwan's market-opening and trade-reform measures. 
Taiwan has also held bilateral tariff-concession talks with 15 
GATT members, including New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the 
United States. It is scheduled to hold similar talks with 
Singapore, Hong Kong, the 12-member European Union, Argentina 
and north European countries in July. 
  Taiwan applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory 
in January 1990 and hopes to be admitted as a full member by the 
end of this year to qualify it to become a founding member of 
the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT early 
next year.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, governor of 
the Central Bank of China, suggested Monday [20 June] that the 
government consider abolishing or lowering the bond-transaction 
tax in a new attempt to revitalize the domestic capital market. 
  Trading of corporate bonds and treasury bills is currently 
subject to the imposition of a 0.1 percent transaction tax, 
while transactions on government bonds are not subject to a tax. 
  The lowering or lifting of the bond-transaction tax would 
help induce more foreign funds to pour into the Taiwan bond 
market and thus boost overall financial activities, Liang noted. 
  The governor made the statement at a seminar on the economy 
sponsored by Academia Sinica, the highest academic body in 
Taiwan. 
  Stressing that the Central Bank welcomes investment from 
abroad, he said four other conditions were necessary for Taiwan 
to open up its capital markets: Making government debts 
publicly known; narrowing differences in financial conditions 
-- such as the difference in interest rates -- between Taiwan 
and foreign countries; introducing measures to help insure 
export-oriented manufacturers against risks; and overhauling of 
the domestic stock market. 
  Bond-market traders reacted positively toward Liang's 
suggestion on the bond tax, [words indistinct] the proposed 
measure would greatly push up the circulation of corporate bonds 
and treasury bills, transactions of which have nearly come to a 
standstill as of late. 
  Trade volume on the bond market, though reaching trillions 
of 
new Taiwan dollars, comes mainly from transactions of government 
bonds, while most corporate bonds and treasury bills are kept by 
banks and insurance companies as reserves, the traders explained. 
  Meanwhile, Liang said he has great confidence that Taipei 
can 
gradually be turned into an Asia-Pacific financial hub, with the 
first step being to become a regional funding center. 
  In its ambition to become a financial center, Taipei aims to 
play a complementary role rather than replace other hubs in this 
part of the world, he elaborated. 
  To fit into the government's financial-internationalization 
strategy, he said, the central bank will also place a top 
priority on enlarging the presence of foreign banks in Taiwan, a 
move expected to bring in more and better financial services.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan may lose about 20 
percent of its export markets to Mainland China in the next five 
years, according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
  The report, to be presented in a mainland affairs meeting to 
be held early next month, says competition between Taiwan and 
the mainland will become increasingly fierce, with Mainland 
China likely to take over U.S.$17 billion worth of Taiwan's 
export markets, or 20.56 percent of Taiwan's total export value 
registered in 1993. 
  Competition in wooden, bamboo, nonmetal furniture and 
miscellaneous industries will be strongest, the report says, 
adding that as high as 70.1 percent of Taiwan's markets in these 
fields may be lost to the mainland. 
  Mainland China may also snatch 40 percent of Taiwan's 
garment 
and costume accessories markets in the next few years, the 
report warns. 
  It points out that because Mainland China has cheap labor 
and 
rich natural resources, its export competitiveness has grown 
rapidly in recent years, particularly in some labor-intensive 
industries. 
  The mainland will become even more competitive in some 
technology-intensive industries after 1997 when Hong Kong will 
revert to its rule, the report says. 
  Taiwan's electronics, machinery, automobile and motorcycle 
makers will face ever stronger competition in the years ahead, 
the report adds.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan imported U.S.$33.64 
million worth of auto parts and components from Europe in the 
first quarter of this year, up 52 percent from the same period 
of 1993, according to statistics released by the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs Monday [20 June]. 
  During the three-month period, imports of stainless steel 
increased the most of any European import over last year's first 
quarter, growing 180 percent, followed by a jump in machinery 
imports of 65 percent, the statistics showed. 
  However, Taiwan's exports to Europe mostly declined during 
the January-March period. Toys and recreational equipment 
registered the largest decline of 25.9 percent to total only 
U.S.$113.98 million. Plastic product exports decreased 22.1 
percent, and bicycle exports fell 1.8 percent. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan's exports to the European Union alone 
decreased during the first five months of 1994, but increased to 
those European countries that are not part of the EU, data 
compiled by the Euro-Asia Trade Organization (EATO) showed. 
  Taiwan exports to the EU totaled U.S.$4.619 billion, down 7 
percent, while exports to non-EU European countries totaled 
U.S.$716.1 million, up 5 percent from the same period of 1993. 
  Among EU countries, exports to Ireland grew 19.6 percent, 
exports to Denmark increased 9.8 percent, and exports to Britain 
increased 2 percent, according to the EATO data. Exports to the 
remaining EU countries declined.

  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- The Investigation Bureau 
announced Monday [20 June] that an international 
drug-trafficking ring involving both Japanese and Taiwanese was 
cracked Sunday, with more than 150 kilograms of amphetamines 
being seized. 
  Five Japanese, including an underground gang member and four 
fishing boat crewmembers, were arrested Sunday while trying to 
smuggle the 151 kilograms of high-grade amphetamines through 
Kagoshima port in Kyushu, Japan. Simultaneously, four 
Taiwanese, including two traffickers and two dealers, were 
apprehended in Taiwan, Wang Hua-fu, a spokesman for the bureau's 
Taipei headquarters, said. 
  Wang said bureau officials had teamed with Japanese police 
for three months in trying to crack the drug ring, which bought 
amphetamines in Mainland China and then smuggled the shipments 
to Japan via Taiwanese and Japanese fishing boats. According to 
Wang, the ring, which was supported by Japanese organized crime 
syndicates, had smuggled several metric tons of amphetamines 
from Mainland China to Japan over the last eight years. 
Amphetamines have become a popular drug among the middle and 
lower classes in Japan, and prices for it have been surpassing 
that of heroin. The amphetamines seized Sunday have a street 
value of US$55.55 million [words indistinct]. 
  This was the biggest anti-drug-smuggling operation mounted 
by 
Taiwan since a national anti-drug conference was held here 
earlier this month.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Domestic farmers will 
suffer greatly from Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), according to a study published Tuesday 
[21 June]. The study, conducted by Professor Peng Tzuo-kuei of 
National Chung Hsing University under the Commission of the 
Council of Agriculture, found that the opening of the domestic 
rice market could mean an income loss to farmers of at least 20 
percent within six years. 
  Taiwan must gradually open its various markets to smooth its 
bid to join GATT, which is expected by the end of the year. The 
government is currently mulling over how best to accomplish a 
rice-market opening in line with GATT while sparing Taiwan rice 
farmers extensive harm. 
  Professor Peng's study says that if Taiwan adopts the 
"Japanese formula," which allows rice imports of up to 4 percent 
of domestic consumption in the first year of market opening and 
gradually increases the imports to 8 percent in the sixth year, 
farm losses could top NT [New Taiwan] $2.6 billion (US$95.94 
million) by the year 2000. If the "Korean formula" is adopted, 
the study says, Taiwan farmers are expected to suffer a loss of 
NT$3.2 billion (US$118.08 million) by the year 2004. Under the 
Korean formula, rice imports will account for only 1 percent of 
domestic consumption in the first year of market opening and the 
import ratio will rise to 4 percent in the 10th year. Farm 
losses will be even higher if expected reductions in government 
farm subsidies were included in the figures, the study notes. 
  The professor recommended that the government lower its 
guaranteed purchase price of rice by 20 percent in six years to 
comply with the GATT Uruguay round codes reached last December. 
The study was the first analysis of the negative impact the 
opening of the rice market will have on Taiwan farmers.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (AFP)--Chinese authorities are 
engaged in the systematic persecution of an evangelical 
Protestant sect in Henan province, with at least 13 "Shouters" 
now in prison, Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a report. 
  "China: Persecution of a Protestant Sect," published 
Wednesday, focuses on an intensive clampdown in the central 
province since the group -- an outgrowth of an indigenous 
Chinese religious sect founded in 1922 -- was labelled 
counterrevolutionary in May 1983. 
  Large-scale persecution began on May 5, 1983 when some 2,000 
Shouters were rounded up nationwide for "re-education," the 
international human rights group quoted an unconfirmed account 
as saying. 
  Some 50 Shouters in Henan have since been jailed for up to 
15 
years, the report said, adding 13 remained in detention while 
three had died in prison or on medical parole, the report said. 
  Since 1990, the authorities have abandoned long sentences in 
favour of shorter administrative detention without recourse to 
trial, during which sect members are bound, beaten with electric 
batons and gagged "if they continue to call on Jesus," it said. 
  Members are also subjected to other forms of persecution, 
including heavy fines and so-called "study sessions," it said. 
  During the several-day sessions, Shouters are "bound with 
rope, forced to stay on their knees for extended periods of 
time, physically abused, and forced on pain of torture to 
renounce their faith, expose their leaders, and join the 
Three-Self Movement," it said. 
  The Three-Self Patriotic Movement is the officially 
sanctioned Protestant Church of China. 
  The continuing clampdown on the Shouters reflects official 
alarm over the rapid growth of the "evangelical, mystical, 
subjective, intuitive, apocalyptic and individual" sect, whose 
membership at its Lushan base in Henan had grown to 200,000 by 
1983, the report said. 
  Human Rights Watch/Asia said its report "provides further 
evidence that the number of known political prisoners and 
religious detainees in China is only a fraction of the real 
total," noting that only 12 Shouters had ever previously been 
listed as having been imprisoned. 
  It called for the immediate and unconditional release of the 
remaining prisoners and "an end to persecution, harassment, 
arbitrary arrest and fining of religious practioners who do not 
identify with official churches." 
  The counterrevolutionary label enabled the authorities in 
the 
1980s to imprison Shouters for long periods while remaining 
within the Chinese law, the report said. 
  But the group -- which stresses Bible study while eschewing 
involvement in broader social or political matters -- rejects 
the label. 
  "The Shouters themselves maintained that their differences 
with the official church were confined to theological 
interpretation and style of worship and were in no way related 
to politics or counterrevolution," the report said. 
  The authorities, which have long sought to prevent the 
spread 
of unregistered "house churches," object to the Shouters' 
evangelical creed, rejection of a professional ministry and 
private meetings. 
  In 1992, officials put the number of Protestants and 
Catholics attending state-approved churches at some eight 
million, acknowledging the number of "secret" worshippers was 
far higher. 
  The report called on Washington to continue pressing Beijing 
to release about 50 religious figures jailed or under house 
arrest who were included on a 1993 U.S. list. 
  China's major trading partners should also push Beijing to 
invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance to 
visit China to recommend specific reforms to enhance religious 
freedom, it said.

  [Text] President Jiang Zemin is in Shenzhen to canvass 
support for Beijing's next major programme for economic reform 
which will be a mixture of liberalisation and centralisation 
measures. 
  Sources in Shenzhen said the municipal leadership yesterday 
lobbied Mr Jiang to allow the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to 
continue its role as a ground for experimenting with market 
reforms. 
  Mr Jiang arrived in the zone on Sunday and will leave today 
or tomorrow. 
  A team appointed by Mr Jiang and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongli is 
in the final process of drafting a document on the "next stage" 
of economic reform, which will be endorsed by the Fourth Plenum 
of the Central Committee scheduled for the autumn. Sources 
familiar with the drafting process said the document would spell 
out the desired kinds of "macro-level adjustments and controls" 
under a socialist market economy. 
  While the document recommends that most of the market 
reforms 
outlined at the Third Plenum last November be continued, it will 
also introduce means in which the Government can ensure that 
they can be accomplished without disruptive effects such as 
inflation and unemployment. 
  The sources said since the spring, Mr Jiang had made trips 
to 
different parts of the country to solicit support for the 
programme. 
  They pointed out Mr Jiang, who is also party General 
Secretary, took the opportunity to warn regional cadres they 
must put the "overall situation of the country" ahead of local 
interests. 
  Recommendations that are expected to be passed by the Fourth 
Plenum include ways to control excessive fixed-assets investment 
by localities and to ensure that sufficient land be devoted to 
farming, especially grain production. Mr Jiang's team is also 
working out strategies to restructure government-owned 
enterprises without leading to unemployment or the loss of state 
assets. 
  Sources in Shenzhen said municipal leaders presented Mr 
Jiang 
with a blueprint for economic reform through to the mid-1990s. 
  "While assuring that Shenzhen would abide by national 
priorities, SEZ cadres indicated they hoped the zone would be 
allowed to go on experimenting with market reforms," a source 
said. 
  "These reforms will set the pace for the entire country, and 
also facilitate the economic integration between Shenzhen and 
Hong Kong." 
  For example, one reform being carried out in the SEZ is to 
promote the separation of Government and business by ensuring 
even state-owned companies no longer need remain the subordinate 
units of government departments. 
  It is understood Mr Jiang gave a general support for 
Shenzhen's reforms, which also enjoy the backing of the State 
Commission for the Reform of the Economic Structure. 
  Last week, Mr Jiang spread the message of liberalisation, 
coupled with restraint, to leaders of other Guangdong cities of 
Guangzhou, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Li Peng, 
premier of the State Council, are very much concerned about 
floods in Guangdong Province. Recently, they repeatedly 
inquired about the flood situation in the Zhu Jiang valley, 
particularly that of Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang. They expressed 
their deep concern for the people in the flood-hit areas, as 
well as extended their warm greetings to the vast number of 
cadres, officers, and men of the People's Liberation Army; armed 
police officers; and public security police who battle on the 
frontline against floods and provide disaster relief. 
  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng gave important directives for 
current 
flood prevention and disaster relief tasks in Guangdong. They 
expressed the hope that under the leadership of the Guangdong 
provincial party committee and government, the Guangdong army 
and people would make concerted efforts in disaster relief; 
earnestly help flood victims solve their living problems; and go 
all out to battle floods to ensure the safety of the Bei Jiang 
dike, Guangzhou city, and the Zhu Jiang Delta.

<F P=106> [Article by Bo Yibo dated 25 May and entitled "Make Every </F>
Effort To Promote Both Material and Spiritual Civilization"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Anthology of 
Education in Professional Ethics in China" will soon be 
available. In asking me to write a preface for the anthology, 
its chief editor said: 
  "The Chinese Society for the Study of Cultural and Economic 
Development Along the Huang He, the Managerial Science Research 
Institute, and the Xinhua Publishing House have organized 
scholars and experts in various professions to jointly compile 
the `Anthology of Education in Professional Ethics in China' by 
-- in light of the norms of professional ethics in their 
respective fields and under the current conditions of developing 
a socialist market economy -- elaborating on the principles, 
content, styles, and methods of vocational ethics education in 
order to make vocational ethics education more methodical and 
standardized. Such books are useful in laying a foundation for 
raising the entire nation's vocational ethics standards and for 
promoting socialist spiritual civilization, in clarifying and 
surmounting the ideological confusion created by 
ultra-individualism and money worship, in improving the 
competence of the ranks of the workers and staff, and in 
resisting and overcoming unhealthy practices in various 
industries, trades, and professions." 
  It is my belief that vocational ethics education can be 
carried out well and effectively only when it is integrated as 
an essential part of socialist spiritual civilization. 
  I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to write 
this preface to say a few words about my personal views on the 
relationship between the two civilizations. 
  With the founding of New China, the CPC became the party in 
power, and it bore upon its shoulders the heavy responsibility 
of promoting the two civilizations. Under the leadership of the 
CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the party as a whole 
carried out the party's three important styles of work 
(integrating theory with practice, practicing criticism and 
self-criticism, and forging close ties with the masses); firmly 
bore in mind the party's purpose of serving the people 
wholeheartedly; was modest and prudent, guarded against 
arrogance and rashness, worked hard, observed discipline, and 
expended great efforts in learning how to run the economy, 
administer state affairs, and ensure the nation's security. 
Within a few years, we were able to recover from the wounds of 
the war, we revived the national economy, and we implemented 
rather successfully the first Five-Year Plan and the remolding 
of socialism, thus bringing about a situation characterized by 
thriving economic development, an improvement in people's lives, 
and a clean and honest party style and general standards of 
social conduct. Comparing the new society with the old one, 
people became aware that only socialism could save China. Aside 
from the correct line, the great successes achieved in the 
construction of two civilizations can also be attributed to a 
group of party cadres who, in the prime of their lives, had 
undergone various tests and had set an example of correctly 
carrying out and executing the party's correct line. 
  Upon the basic completion of its socialist transformation, 
China has entered a period of full socialist construction. When 
we say full, this naturally covers the building of both material 
and spiritual civilization. The policy decision made by the 
Eighth CPC National Congress has been correct, in holding that 
socialism has been basically established in China; and that 
despite the continued existence of class struggle and the need 
for further strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, 
the nation's principal contradiction is no longer between the 
working and the capitalist classes but rather between the 
people's urge for rapid economic and cultural development and 
the current economic and cultural conditions that fail to 
satisfy the people's needs. The principal missions of the 
people throughout the country are to concentrate their strength 
for the development of social productive forces, to realize the 
state's industrialization programs, and to gradually satisfy the 
people's ever-increasing economic and cultural needs. However, 
due to insufficient ideological preparedness for all-around 
socialist construction -- particularly the emergence of a 
relapse concerning the understanding of the principal 
contradiction -- and the "leftist" mistake we have committed, we 
have been unable to persist in the correct line set by the 
Eighth CPC National Congress. Although the party intended to 
focus its attention on economic development, the approach was 
wrong. While the people were zealous for construction, the 
party's guiding principles have not been in line with the 
objective economic law, thus resulting in the blunders of the 
"Great Leap Forward" and the "People's Commune," which 
frustrated the building of the two civilizations. After the 
party discovered its flaws and after a five-year adjustment 
period, China managed to regain its lease on life concerning the 
national economy, with encouraging results being achieved in the 
building of spiritual civilization. Jiao Yulu, Lei Feng, and 
Wang Jinxi were typical advanced models who sprung up during 
this period. Unfortunately, the party has abandoned its central 
task of economic construction and has clung for a long period to 
the wrong guiding principle of "taking class struggle as the key 
link," which subsequently caused the decade-long civil strife of 
the "Great Cultural Revolution" and thus the grievous 
devastation of the building of the two civilizations. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee 
made a great historic turn by resolutely terminating the use of 
the wrong slogan of "taking class struggle as the key link" -- 
which was not suitable for a socialist society and which ran 
totally counter to China's actual state conditions -- and by 
making a timely strategic policy decision to divert the party's 
central task to the socialist modernization drive. As reform 
and opening up went deeper, Comrade Deng Xiaoping profoundly 
pointed out: "The Essence of socialism is to emancipate and 
develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation, and 
remove polarization for the final attainment of common 
prosperity." "Upholding reform and opening up is a move that 
will determine China's fate." Making sure that reform and 
opening up will be carried out in a healthy manner, he also put 
forward the packaged principle of "being firm in attending to 
both material progress and cultural and ideological progress." 
Under the guidance of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we have scored successes that have become the 
focus of world attention. There is no denying the fact that 
during the new-old transition process, we did made mistakes on 
the question of precedence, amid calls for improvements in such 
aspects as the party and social atmospheres. Our party is taking 
measures to solve these problems. With efforts in party 
building being intensified, with the fundamental improvement, 
enhancement, and perfection of the party's democratic centralism 
for a genuine application in daily life; with the legal system 
being improved to such a level that there are sufficient laws 
for us to follow, with the anticorruption drive going deeper, 
and with the gradual establishment of a socialist market 
economic order, all these problems are solvable. Of course, we 
need time to solve these problems once and for all. As long as 
long as we carry out our work unswervingly and succeed in 
finding ways and reaching a consensus, I think that these 
problems may -- in fact, must -- be solved within three to five 
years. 
  From a brief account of the historical process mentioned 
above, we can reach a common understanding on the following two 
points: 1) The extent of the achievements scored by us in 
building the two civilizations depends, first of all, on whether 
the party's line is correct or not. If the line is correct, our 
achievements will be great; if the line is not on the right 
track, our achievements will be small or even incline to the 
opposite direction. The extent of our achievements also depends 
on whether our party organizations at all levels can correctly 
implement the party's line as well as a series of principles and 
policies it has adopted. The level of understanding gained by 
cadres, their ability to have the overall situation well in 
hand, and whether they really implement the party's line, 
principles, and policies in handling concrete tasks and play an 
exemplary role will affect, to a great extent, the success of 
the building of the two civilizations. Therefore, arming the 
whole party with the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, enhancing the consciousness of all comrades of 
the party concerning the implementation of the party's basic 
line -- "one central task and two basic points," and adhering to 
the principle of grasping two links at the same time and of 
taking a tough stand on both become a key aspect of our endeavor 
to successfully build the two civilizations. 2) We must persist 
in paying equal attention to building the two civilizations at 
the same time. Not a single one of the two civilizations can be 
dispensed with. They interact with and promote each other. The 
building of material civilization provides a strong material 
basis for the building of socialist spiritual civilization. 
"Poverty is not socialism." "Socialism must get rid of 
poverty." It is very hard to imagine that we can successfully 
build a socialist spiritual civilization if we do not develop 
the economy or get rid of poverty and backwardness or if we 
deviate from an economic basis. Of course, neither do we 
approve of the concept that spiritual civilization will be good 
naturally when the economy is developed. With regard to 
spiritual civilization, what counts is the effort to build it. 
If the building of spiritual civilization is carried out 
successfully, this will in turn provide a spiritual driving 
force as well as support in terms of intellectual resources for 
the building of material civilization and an ideological 
guarantee for the correct orientation of its development. The 
two are organically integrated in the practice of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Recently, the central authorities have repeatedly stressed: 
"Judging by the overall situation of reform, opening up, and 
modernization in China, the crux of the matter lies in properly 
handling the relationships between reform, development, and 
stability." I think that these six [figure as received] Chinese 
characters -- reform, development, and stability -- are very 
profoundly expounded because they also summarize the dialectic 
materialist internal relationship between the building of 
spiritual civilization and that of material civilization. The 
purpose of reform is to achieve development, but if we want to 
achieve development very satisfactorily, we must have a stable 
social environment. An organic integration between reform, 
development, and stability will enable the three to promote one 
another. It includes the building of both material civilization 
and spiritual civilization. 
  Professional ethics education is an aspect that ought to be 
included in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and 
an indispensable condition for establishing a socialist market 
economic order. "The Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on 
the Guiding Principle for the Building of Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization" pointed out: "We must make vigorous efforts to 
promote professional ethics in all trades and professions." 
Promoting professional ethics becomes particularly conspicuous 
and important in the process of shifting from the traditional 
planned economic system to a socialist market economic system. 
  High standards for professional ethics become increasingly 
necessary as a new socialist market economic system is gradually 
established and as socialist laws and regulations are gradually 
amplified. We are entirely capable of attaining these high 
standards because we have Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as 
our guidance, because we have accumulated both positive and 
negative experience in more than four decades after the founding 
of the People's Republic, and because we have a socialist 
system, the fine traditions of the party, and the traditional 
virtues of the Chinese nation. All these are our strong points. 
Meanwhile, we must also draw lessons from the Western 
countries' advanced experience in management and their 
successful employment of professional ethics education. While 
making unremitting efforts to successfully promote economic 
construction, we must pay close attention to successfully 
building spiritual civilization, and we must vigorously advocate 
regular education in and the study of professional ethics among 
all trades and professions in a bid to enable all citizens to 
live up to a code of conduct compatible with rapid social 
development, to conscientiously abide by their respective 
trades' and professions' standards of professional ethics, and 
to become a new generation of well-educated, well-disciplined 
people imbued with lofty ideals and moral values. If everyone 
in all trades and professions can "start cultivating 
professional ethics for himself or herself" to enable a social 
custom under which everyone observes professional ethics to take 
shape, the general mood of society will surely improve, we shall 
certainly be able to promote the development of social 
productive forces, and the overall quality of our entire nation 
will surely be enhanced.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Resolutely Implement the Strategy </F>
of Giving Priority to the Development of Education -- Hailing 
the Close of the National Education Work Conference"] 
  [Text] The national education work conference convened by 
the party Central Committee and the State Council has ended in 
triumph. This is an important conference to mobilize the whole 
party and all of society to further implement the strategy of 
giving priority to the development of education, and to 
seriously carry out the "Program for Education Reform and 
Development in China" in a new situation, in which the 
establishment of the socialist market economy structure and 
modernization are being accelerated in China. The meeting 
certainly will have a great influence on the realization of the 
strategic goal of educational reform and development in China in 
the 1990's, and on promoting reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  The rise or decline of a country is determined by education. 
This is particularly true of our country, which has a population 
of nearly 1.2 billion, with relatively insufficient resources 
and relatively backward economy and culture. One thing that has 
a decisive significance for the attainment of the magnificent 
goal of socialist modernization is to shift economic 
construction into the orbit of depending on the progress in 
science and technology and of improving the quality of laborers, 
and to raise the entire nation's level of ideology, ethics, 
science, and culture. It is precisely because of this that the 
CPC Central Committee has decided to put education in a 
strategic position, in which priority is given to its 
development. This is a far-sighted strategic policy decision, 
and is a matter of fundamental importance in the realization of 
modernization in our country. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, the broad masses of educational workers have worked 
industriously under the leadership of party committees and 
governments at all levels. They have rapidly developed the 
cause of education in our country, gradually carried out reform 
in education, made remarkable achievements in educational work, 
improved the quality of the people, trained large numbers of 
qualified personnel, and made an important contribution to our 
country's economic construction, scientific and technological 
progress, and social development. At the same time, we also 
should be aware that education in our country is still 
relatively backward, educational reform still lags behind the 
demands of the establishment of the socialist market economy 
structure, and educational development still cannot meet the 
needs of modernization. The phenomenon of neglecting education 
-- and of neglecting basic education, in particular -- still 
exists to varying degrees in some localities and departments. 
These localities and departments lack a sense of urgency in 
educational reform and in practical work, and have not 
completely put education in a strategical position in which 
priority is given to its development. This situation demands 
prompt solution. 
  The most important thing in implementing the spirit of the 
national educational work conference and to carry out the 
"Program for Education Reform and Development in China" is to 
make great efforts to understand and implement the two words 
"giving priority" in "giving priority to the development of 
education." We should not just talk about "giving priority," 
write about it on paper, and discuss it at meetings, but should 
implement it in work and in deed. As far as planning and the 
arrangement of funds are concerned, party committees and 
governments at all levels, in studying and formulating 
development plans and annual plans, should ensure that priority 
is given to the development of education; in making arrangements 
for financial budget and spending, should ensure that priority 
is given to the needs of education; and in increasing wages for 
staff members and workers, should ensure that priority is given 
to raising the wages of teachers. As far as the arrangement and 
inspection of work are concerned, party committees and 
governments at all levels should give priority to the study and 
arrangements for educational work, and should give priority to 
summing up and inspecting educational work. As far as the 
appraisal and use of cadres are concerned, party committees and 
governments at all levels should give priority to the appraisal 
and use of cadres engaged in educational work and to the 
appraisal of how cadres at lower levels exercise leadership over 
educational work. They should give priority to promoting cadres 
who attach importance to education and have made achievements in 
work in leading posts in education. As far as commending and 
awarding the advanced is concerned, party committees and 
governments at all levels should give priority to commending and 
awarding advanced individuals and collectives that have worked 
industriously for the reform and development of education, have 
made selfless contributions, have obtained remarkable results in 
work, and really have made major attainments. For sometime to 
come in the future, we should make greater efforts, from top to 
bottom, to create the public opinion of "giving priority to 
education," to think of practical moves to "give priority to 
education," to do solid work to "give priority to education," 
and to get actual results in "giving priority to education." We 
should make unremitting efforts over a period of time to enable 
the strategy of giving priority to the development of education 
to strike root deeply in ideological concepts and in actual 
work. We should turn "giving priority to education" into the 
ideological habit of the people and the conscious demand in the 
arrangement of work, so that "giving priority to education" can 
become a common practice in society. In this way, our country 
and our nation will be full of promise. 
  Ideology is the guide to action. To do a good job in 
implementing the spirit of the recent educational work 
conference, we must seriously study Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
important speech at the conference and Comrade Li Peng's theme 
report. In particular, we should seriously study and understand 
a series of expositions on education made by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping. Comrade Xiaoping's ideas on education are the 
theoretical basis for our party to formulate the educational 
principles and policies for the new period, and are a powerful 
ideological weapon guiding educational reform and development. 
At the last national educational work conference nine years 
ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made an important speech entitled: 
"Seriously Grasp Education Work." (See Volume 3 of 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.) He pointed out: "A 
leader who neglects education is a leader who lacks 
far-sightedness, is not mature, and is not able to lead 
modernization." Comrade Xiaoping hopes party committees and 
governments at all levels will grasp education work and will 
"not indulge in empty talk, but do more solid work." That 
speech was very good and what he said is still applicable to 
reality, even today. We suggest that leading comrades at all 
levels restudy it properly. 
  The key to revitalizing education lies in leadership. As 
long as the leadership of party committees and governments at 
all levels really implement the strategy of giving priority to 
the development of education, a new situation in which education 
in our country develops even more vigorously certainly will 
emerge!

<F P=106> [By a correspondent in New York] </F>
  [Text] A Chinese labour activist has described his 
dramatic escape from a detention centre. 
  Wang Jiaqi, who fled to Hong Kong on April 17, arrived in 
New 
York City on Sunday after spending time in another Western 
country. 
  In his first interview since leaving China, Mr Wang, a 
graduate law student at Beijing University, alleged that his 
arrest and subsequent incarceration was illegal. 
  The dissident's detention on March 2 is believed to be 
linked 
to the role he played in the formation of a League for the 
Protection of the Rights for Workers. 
  "I was arrested in Beijing by seven security agents who wore 
no uniforms," said Mr Wang, himself a Public security Bureau 
(PSB) officer in Tangshan before his enrolment at Beijing 
University. 
  "They refused to identify themselves, put a hood over my 
face, and practically abducted me." 
  The PSB held him prisoner in a hostel belonging to an 
electricity company in Changping district, Beijing, but rarely 
spoke to him. 
  After six days Mr Wang was handed over to PSB officials in 
his home town, Tangshan, 200 kilometres east of the capital, but 
even there he was held not in an official prison but in a 
semi-legal lock-up belonging to the local steel works. 
  After he staged a three-day hunger strike he was shifted to 
the barracks of the People's Armed Police in Tangshan, where he 
was kept in a room under 24 hour watch by three police. 
  PSB officials there made no attempt to question him, 
because, 
they told him, they had not been told why he had been arrested. 
  On the evening of March 27, helped by quick thinking, Mr 
Wang 
managed to dupe his guards and to escape while he was being 
escorted across a courtyard to a toilet. 
  "Three guards are supposed to be watching me all the time," 
Mr Wang said. "One of them got drunk and the other was cramming 
for an examination in an adjacent room." 
  As a result, only one guard was with him as he made a quick 
dash out of the open gates of the barracks. 
  Mr Wang said his escape was only successful because a truck 
passed the entrance of the barracks just as he ran out past the 
sentry. 
  He threw himself on to the vehicle and was able to get away 
into the centre of Tangshan before the guards could react. 
  "The barracks is not designed to hold prisoners," Mr Wang 
said. "And the sentries are on the look out for intruders from 
outside instead of preventing people from getting out." 
  The dissident also indicated he tried to make friends with 
the three guards, and the night of the escape, he succeeded in 
persuading the senior PSB officer to start drinking. 
  Within an hour of his escape every exit from Tangshan was 
sealed by police, and searches were carried out throughout the 
city. 
  But after a few days police, convinced that Mr Wang had fled 
in the hour before the checkpoints were in place, lifted the 
restrictions, and he was able to escape undetected to Beijing. 
  Planning or carrying out a prison escape is a capital 
offence 
in China, but Mr Wang said he was not frightened. In Beijing, 
Mr Wang contacted the "underground railway", a network of 
dissidents which arranged for him to get to Hong Kong. He 
waited eight weeks before U.S. immigration authorities were able 
to complete entry procedures. 
  Mr Wang, who was doing post-graduate study in criminal 
procedure law at Beijing University, has gone to the U.S. as a 
visiting academic and has no intention of applying for asylum, 
he said. He is on a one-year research programme at Columbia 
University, New York, where he will continue research into 
Chinese law. 
  Two other legal experts Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang, 
disappeared within a day of Mr Wang's arrest and have not been 
seen since. The three men had drawn up a five-point petition on 
labour rights which they had intended to present to China's 
National People's Congress. They had also planned to formally 
register the League, for which Mr Wang had written the 
constitution. 
  Mr Wang and legal experts he has talked to in the West said 
his virtual kidnap by unidentified security agents represented a 
disturbing new trend in Beijing's campaign against dissident 
intellectuals. 
  The use of unofficial or semi-legal lock-ups to hold 
political dissidents is also a new development, they said, and 
raised the possibility that dissidents could be held in any of 
the thousands of small prisons within state factories and police 
barracks to which no one outside China, and probably few locals, 
had access. 
  Mr Wang said that although he had worked in Tangshan as a 
police official for several years, he had never heard of the 
steel corporation prison in which he was held in March. 
  He said that official showed him a faxed copy of a detention 
order which appeared to justify his arrest, but it gave no 
legally recognisable description of the charge for which he was 
held. 
  "On the detention order they showed me the offence for which 
I was held was described as tuanhuo, a non-legal term with no 
precise definition and roughly corresponding to `forming a 
conspiratorial group'," said Mr Wang, who had refused to 
countersign the order. 
  In a message to China's leaders, Mr Wang said that since the 
Chinese Communist Party "represents the country on the 
international stage it should make great efforts to observe the 
rule of international law". 
  "The Party should have enough confidence to reform itself," 
said Mr Wang who remains strongly committed to non-violent 
reform in China and consider his work to be non-political.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ching Chi (5428 2765): "Beijing </F>
Recruits College Graduates To Replenish Police, Which Are of 
Poor Quality and Short-Handed"] 
  [Text] At present, graduates from the public security 
schools and colleges in the mainland can hardly meet the needs 
of the police service in all localities. The poor quality of 
the police force, which is also short-handed, has become one of 
the major reasons for the failure to effectively contain crime. 
This year, the public security departments of Beijing and some 
other big cities, for the first time, will recruit police 
officers openly in society, and this will meet with a positive 
response from graduates of colleges and secondary vocational 
schools. 
  At a recent job orientation meeting for 1994 college and 
secondary vocational school graduates in Beijing, the Beijing 
Municipal Public Security Bureau, for the first time, openly 
recruited a number of policemen and policewomen from among 
applicants in society. Beyond many people's expectations, many 
college graduates showed interest in joining the police force. 
At the meeting, some 2,500 college and secondary vocational 
school graduates made inquiries, and 870 people -- including 440 
female college students -- filled in forms to show their 
interest. 
  The practice of the police in Beijing showed that they were 
in need of competent personnel, and police in all parts of the 
country also face the same situation. According to statistics, 
the proportion of policemen and public security personnel to the 
national population now is greatly lower than in other 
countries. In particular, a large part of the police force in 
China is the armed police force, responsible for domestic 
security, and the proportion of the police force directly used 
to manage public order and check crimes is even smaller. In 
addition, the police force is prominently short of officers who 
know foreign languages and have mastered modern skills in police 
work. 
  In Beijing, the number of policemen and the proportion of 
the 
police troops to the local population are slightly higher than 
in other provinces and municipalities, but the police force in 
Beijing shoulders much heavier tasks than its counterparts in 
other localities. They not only have to maintain law and order 
in the capital and guarantee the security of major conferences, 
important visitors, and large cultural and sports events, but 
also have to guarantee the safety of foreign visitors. The 
image of the police in Beijing also reflects, to a certain 
degree, the image of the nation. Therefore, in addition to 
replenishing the police force in Beijing, the overall quality of 
the police force there also must be enhanced so that it can 
match Beijing's status. 
  According to statistics, however, only 14 percent of the 
policemen and policewomen in Beijing are college or secondary 
vocational school graduates, and the percentage is six points 
lower then the national average. As Beijing now is becoming a 
modern international metropolis, this quality of the police 
force often causes embarrassment to the capital city. When some 
foreigners want to seek help from policemen, this may embarrass 
most policemen, who even do not know the simplest English words. 
In addition, the police force now still cannot proficiently 
operate the modern communications system, make scientific 
arrangements, and carry out effective management. A modern 
metropolis needs a high-quality guardian. 
  The responsible officials of the Public Security Ministry 
also are clearly aware of the hidden crisis in the quality of 
the police force. Zhu Chunlin, deputy director of the Political 
Department of the Public Security Ministry, said that it is 
necessary to enhance and improve the overall educational 
background and structure of the public security personnel and 
police officers. In particular, in order to modernize the means 
of public security, it is urgently necessary to recruit people 
who have received better education. The proportion of college 
graduates in the police force, especially that in Beijing, will 
be getting larger. The general educational condition of the 
police also will be raised. 
  At present, however, the public security schools in all 
parts 
of the country still cannot provide sufficient graduates to meet 
the needs of the police department. On the other hand, the 
educational background of the policemen and policewomen 
recruited openly in society remains at a comparatively low 
level, and the recruits must first receive a certain amount of 
training. Therefore, police recruitment must be linked with the 
competitive job market in order to attract more competent 
personnel, and should be opened to college graduates first. 
However, it is still unknown how many college students will 
have an interest in joining the police force. 
  This time, the job orientation meeting for the college 
graduates in Beijing brought unexpected gratification to the 
police in Mainland China. Applicants on that occasion included 
college graduates majoring in 63 branches of learning, including 
law, Chinese language, computer science, and foreign languages. 
There also were doctorate candidates, postgraduate students for 
master's degree courses, and college graduates holding double 
bachelor degrees. As the police recruitment action also was 
opened to females, this attracted a large number of female 
college students.

  [Text] The national on-the-spot meeting on selling the 
land-use rights of underdeveloped mountains, lands, beaches, 
grasslands, and water areas in order to improve the small 
valleys ended in Mudanjiang on 19 June. Zhou Wenzhi, vice 
minister of water resources, and Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen 
attended the conference. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng sent a letter to the 
conference. He said: The current practice of selling land-use 
rights of underdeveloped mountains, lands, beaches, grasslands, 
and water areas in order to improve the small valleys is the 
continuity and development of the implementation of the 
family-based output-related contract responsibility system in 
China's rural areas and a major move of using the market 
mechanism to mobilize thousands upon thousands of households to 
prevent soil erosion under the new situation. Its biggest 
advantage is to allow peasants to buy the land-use rights of 
underdeveloped mountains, lands, beaches, grasslands, and water 
areas in line with law in an effort to improve small valleys and 
let them boldly carry out diversified undertakings, inherit or 
resell the land-use rights. This will help promote the rational 
use of natural resources and further develop agricultural 
production. 
  At the conference, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Shandong Provinces, 
and our province's Mudanjiang city and Muling County 
respectively introduced their experiences. 
  The participants visited the land-use right selling sites in 
(Fuqiang Village) and (Modaoshi) Town in Muling County to learn 
about the specific situations of these village and town after 
selling the land-use rights of underdeveloped mountains, lands, 
beaches, grasslands, and water areas. These wastelands caused 
by unplanned development have disrupted ecological balance which 
constitute a problem we must resolve. Muling County is located 
in the mountainous area. The reckless felling of trees in the 
mountains and unplanned development of wastelands in the past 
caused the soil eroded areas of Muling County to reach more than 
2.2 million mu. Last year, this county adopted the method of 
selling the land-use rights of underdeveloped mountains, lands, 
beaches, grasslands, and water areas to peasants. If they 
cannot attain the improvement standards within the set time, the 
land-use rights will be recalled. This will make peasants treat 
the land-use rights for improving wastelands and mountains 
which they buy as their own affairs and accelerate the progress 
of improving the underdeveloped mountains, land, beaches, 
grasslands, and water areas. While improving the underdeveloped 
mountains and slopes, peasants may plant grass and trees on the 
mountain slopes, and interplant some economic crops. In less 
than six months, this county sold more than 120,000 mu of 
land-use rights of underdeveloped mountains, lands, beaches, 
grasslands, and water areas, thus becoming one of the counties 
in China where the selling of land-use rights of underdeveloped 
lands is fairly good.

<F P=106> [By Gong Qian: "Accent Put on Standard Mandarin"] </F>
  [Text] A nationwide Putonghua--standard Mandarin--contest 
has been launched in a bid to promote a common spoken form of 
the Chinese language across the country. 
  Sponsored by the Central People's Broadcasting Station 
(CPBS) 
and the State Language Commission (SLC), "The Third National 
Putonghua Broadcasting Contest" is being staged to further 
spread the standard tongue and eliminate communication 
difficulties between people speaking different dialects. 
  The contest will be open to participants from 30 provinces 
and regions. 
  Each will be allowed to put forward two candidates to 
compete 
in the finals to be held in Beijing in October. 
  Entrants from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will also take 
part 
in the competition. 
  Due to the huge expanse of the People's Republic, many 
regional dialects exist. With the development of a more 
integrated national economy, the problems created by people 
speaking local dialects has become ever more conspicuous. 
  "As the economic and personnel exchanges among regions 
increase, the need to learn Putongua has become acute!" said 
Zhong Zheming of the SLC, noting that many individual 
businessmen are trying to standardize their oral ability. 
  Furthermore, with the advent of speech from computer 
software, Putonghua is also needed as the basis for 
communications between machines and men.

<H5>  Drive in Rural Areas To Concentrate Attack on Four Types of </H5>
Criminal 
  A member of the CCPC Central Commission on Political Science 
and Laws recently stressed that rectifying public security in 
rural areas is part and parcel of the 1994 task of improving all 
facets of public security. The department concerned will take 
"major steps" to crack down mainly on four types of criminals so 
that the public security in rural areas will be markedly 
improved within a short period. The four criminal types are: 
One, local riffraff, rural despots, hooligans, and other evil 
forces, especially robbery gangs and criminal organizations 
close to the underworld; two, train robbers, highwaymen, 
priates, and those engaged in murder, robbery, causing 
explosions, and rape using force; three, serious criminals 
guilty of destroying railroads and telecommunications and 
production equipment or stealing state assets; and four, those 
who organize prostitution, engage in drug trafficking, abduct 
and sell women and children, defraud others of their money 
through superstition and the manufacture and distribution of 
obscene items, and who organize gambling. (Summary) (Hong Kong

<H5>  Xiamen Crackdown Nets Over 300 Criminals </H5>
  After a chorus of complaints from foreign businessmen in 
Xiamen Special Economic Zone about kidnappings, theft, and 
extortion, Fujian Public Security Bureau ordered a crackdown. A 
total of 334 people were detained in two raids on residential 
areas surrounding industrial zones in the city. Included in 
this total were 27 criminal gangs. This action was part of a 
"100 days to clean up social order" campaign begun in March by 
local police which also included crackdowns on auto theft and 
prostitution. Those detained were mostly involved in stealing 
expensive imported materials or personal belongings from foreign 
investors. Xiamen accounts for 39 p[ercent of Fujian's exports 
and provincial officials are concerned about a loss of foreign 
investment if the crime wave continues. A Xiamen Public 
Security Bureau official said that the majority of the suspects 
would probably be lent to labor reeducation camps in remote 
localities, a disciplinary measure which police in China can 
impose without the approval of the courts. Serious offenders 
would be formally arrested and passed on to the judicial 
authorities. Death sentences were likely for some of those 
passed on to the courts but most would be given prison terms the 
official said. (Summary) (Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English

<H5>  Intensified Action Against Smuggling Reaps Results </H5>
  Shanghai recently strengthened action against smuggling and 
has solved a number of serious cases, effectively preventing the 
spread of such crimes. Statistics show that between January 
1993 and May 1994 the municipality solved 2,169 cases involving 
393 million renminbi. Tax revenue totaling 21 million remninbi 
was recovered as were 132 cars, 400 gm of marijuana paste, and 
869 historical relics. A visitor from Taiwan was recently 
arrested attempting to smuggle $100,000 in cash. Currently, 
smuggling using containers is still serious in Shanghai as is 
the smuggling of cars by sea. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO

  [Text] Wuhan, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chen Yaobang, Chinese 
vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, revealed here 
Sunday [19 June] that development of the five provinces in 
central China would be accelerated. 
  Addressing the closing session of a symposium on the 
strategy 
for the development of the provinces and cities in central 
China, Chen pointed out that the five provinces in central 
China, namely Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Henan, occupy a 
decisive position in the country's national economic development. 
  He said that the area produces 27.2 percent of the country's 
grain, 46 percent of the country's cotton and 35 percent of the 
country's oil-bearing crops. It is also the country's important 
base of power and raw materials. The area is a hub of 
communications in the country and is inhabited by one fourth of 
the country's population. 
  In 1992, Chen stressed, the area's gross product accounted 
for merely 18.4 percent of the gross national product, and its 
foreign trade volume and overseas funds used were all less than 
five percent of the national total. Therefore, he said, it is 
urgent to speed up the development of the area. 
  He disclosed that the central government had started to draw 
up a program on the economic development in the five provinces 
so as to accelerate the economic development of the whole 
central and western parts of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478), chief economic </F>
manager of the State Statistical Bureau, by Chen Zengjun (7115 
1073 6511); place and date not given: "The Overall Economy Is 
Developing in a Favorable Direction, Enterprise Operations Need 
To Accord With Market Changes--Interviewing Qiu Xiaohua, Chief 
Economic Manager of the State Statistical Bureau"] 
  [Text] [JINGJI RIBAO] Since the beginning of the year, 
the state has successively implemented a series of major reform 
measures. The smooth implementation of these measures requires 
a stable economic environment as a guarantee. Compared to the 
previous stage, economic operations since the beginning of the 
year have seen a very great qualitative improvement. Can you 
provide an overall assessment of this in terms of the current 
economic situation? 
  [Qiu] Seen from the macroeconomic level, the economy has 
already passed through a difficult period and is now moving in a 
positive direction. The most difficult time was the period 
before the central macroeconomic regulatory and control measures 
were put in place in the second half of last year, when economic 
operations saw overheating in some areas, the fiscal and banking 
situations were quite serious, and price increases were rather 
swift. After the macroeconomic regulatory and control measures 
were implemented, these situations saw a turnaround. With a 
turn for the better in the fiscal and banking order, inflation, 
which had been quite serious for a time, is controlled. It 
should be said that the current economic situation is developing 
in a good direction. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] Could you please be more specific about the 
signals showing that development is proceeding in a positive 
direction? 
  [Qiu] I think that this is reflected in the following areas: 
  First, the state economy has seen a change from a situation 
of excessively fast growth to appropriate growth. In the first 
quarter of this year, GDP was 862 billion yuan, growth of 12.7 
percent compared with the same period in the previous year. If 
we take into account the seasonal influence, whereby the 
agricultural proportion was quite low (8 percent) and the 
industrial proportion was quite high, growth over the year will 
convert to about 10 percent. This shows that the current speed 
of economic growth is being kept within the anticipated 
macroeconomically controlled range of 9 to 10 percent. 
  Second, seen from the industrial situation, the development 
trend is positive. From January to April this year, growth in 
industrial added value was maintained at between 16 and 18 
percent, and the major fluctuations experienced at the beginning 
of last year did not occur. This speed of development is ideal 
if we are to maintain a 9-10 percent rate of growth in the 
overall economy. 
  Seen from the structure of industrial growth since the 
beginning of this year, there have been some positive changes. 
This has been reflected in the product mix, with sustained and 
stable growth being seen in the production of energy, major raw 
and semi-finished materials, and materials for agricultural use. 
The production of consumer products which have ready markets, 
such as electrical appliances and foodstuffs, has seen quite 
swift growth. The growth in production of investment goods has 
been controlled. In terms of the regional structure, high-speed 
growth has been maintained in the southeastern coastal areas and 
the Chang Jiang Delta area, while growth has accelerated each 
month in the western regions. In terms of the ownership 
structure, at the same time as speedy growth has been maintained 
in the nonstate-owned economy, production by state-owned 
enterprises has also seen monthly growth. Calculated on a 
comparable basis, over the period from January to April, 
production by state-owned enterprises was 4.7 percent up 
compared with the same period last year, and in April growth was 
5 percent. It is predicted that May's growth will be even 
higher. 
  At the same time, the performance of industrial enterprises, 
and, in particular, state-owned enterprises, has improved each 
month. In the first quarter of the year, the sales revenue of 
state-owned enterprises was up 7.8 percent compared with the 
same period last year. In April, growth was 8.3 percent. The 
production-sales ratios over the four months from January to 
April were 89 percent, 91 percent, 94 percent, and 94 percent, 
respectively. 
  Profits of state-owned enterprises also saw a gradual turn 
for the better. The performance of many state-owned 
enterprises, based on comparable figures, saw an improvement 
compared to the same period of the previous year, and, even when 
assessed using the new method of calculation adopted this year, 
there has also been a continued turn for the better. For 
example, in accordance with the new method of calculation, in 
the first quarter of this year, profits and taxes realized by 
state-owned enterprises grew 16.3 percent compared with the same 
period last year. In April, growth was 37.7 percent. In this 
figure, profits in the first quarter fell 42.4 percent compared 
with the same period last year. However, in April there was a 
profits growth of 7.7 percent compared to the same period last 
year. At the same time, the proportion of enterprise losses as 
compared to enterprise profits also saw a clear decline compared 
with the same period last year. 
  Third, the trend toward excessively swift growth in 
investment has been controlled and there has been an obvious 
drop in the rate of growth. The supply-demand relationship in 
the domestic market has seen marked improvement. 
  Fourth, agricultural production has seen a warming. 
  Fifth, the financial situation has seen a change from the 
quite grim circumstances in the first quarter to basic normality 
this year [sentence as published]. The wild collection of 
funds, the arbitrary establishment of banking organs, the dip in 
residents' savings, and the payment difficulties situation seen 
in many banks has been greatly improved. Since the last half of 
last year, residents' savings have grown stably again, there has 
been a marked improvement in the banking order, and the payments 
capacity of the banks has been strengthened. This has 
guaranteed the needs of current economic development and reform 
and opening up. 
  Sixth, the fiscal situation has seen a turn for the 
better, fiscal revenue has grown steadily, and revenue and 
expenditures are basically balanced. 
  Seventh, the international balance of payments situation has 
seen a turn for the better, exports have seen quite swift 
growth, and in April, export growth exceeded import growth for 
the first time since September 1992. Foreign exchange reserves 
have grown, and in April foreign exchange reserves were $8 
billion up on the figure at the beginning of the year. 
  Eighth, the people's standard of living has been improved 
and 
the income of many people has grown. In the last four months, 
the growth in the livelihood income of urban residents has been 
higher than the 10 percent rise in prices. Incomes of rural 
residents have also grown markedly. In the first quarter, if we 
exclude price increase factors, they grew 14 percent compared to 
the same period last year. 
  The above positive changes show that since the second half 
of 
last year, the series of measures implemented by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council in order to carry out 
macroeconomic regulation and control and deepen reform have been 
correct and have already realized obvious achievements. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] If we are to maintain the fine situation seen 
in economic development at present, what aspects do we need to 
continue to pay attention to? 
  [Qiu] My personal opinion is that, at present, the major 
question we need to pay attention to is prices. Since the 
beginning of this year, while the trend toward inflation has 
been controlled, market prices have grown quite quickly. 
  Since the end of last year, due to the influence of various 
factors and because of the delayed effects of overheating and 
the chaos which has occurred in various aspects of economic 
life, market prices have experienced a situation of strong 
increases. From November last year to February this year, the 
monthly national retail price index grew at an average of 3.4 
percent. From March onward, as governments at various levels 
adopted measures to hold prices down, the trend of rapid 
increase was controlled. In March, the monthly index growth 
rate fell to 0.9 percent, while in April it was 1.3 percent. 
However, seen from the monthly index growth, the level of 
prices is still somewhat high. From January to April national 
retail prices were up 20 percent compared with the same period 
last year, and while price rises were controlled in March and 
April in medium-sized and large cities, the price rise situation 
was still quite strong in rural areas and some small cities. 
Seen in terms of commodity types, those products which saw the 
greatest increases were mainly centered on those commodities 
needed in daily life. Thus, they had quite a strong impact on 
low-income households. 
  Second, it is worth pointing out that market restraints have 
become increasingly prominent. Since the beginning of this 
year, domestic markets in some spheres have seen the beginnings 
of cooling down through stability. From January to April, real 
growth in national retail sales, after excluding price factors, 
was 4.2 percent. This was 3 to 4 percentage points lower than 
in a normal year. The production-sales ratio for industrial 
products was 92.2 percent, nearly 4 percentage points lower than 
normal. The volume of means of production traded also declined. 
Although this trend is very beneficial to structural 
readjustment, in the short term it will probably be accompanied 
by some negative effects on the economic cycle. 
  In addition, some deep, structural contradictions which 
affect the bringing into play of the vigor of state-owned 
enterprises have not yet been eliminated, and some state-owned 
enterprises are still in serious difficulties. The scale of 
fixed-asset investment in projects under construction is still 
quite great, and some disadvantageous factors in agricultural 
production have still not been completely eliminated. These are 
all disadvantageous elements which affect the fine cycle of the 
economy. 
  Seen from the deep level, we can recognize that the problems 
which exist in economic life were not formed overnight. Thus, 
the resolution of the problems cannot be completely achieved 
within a short period. Macroeconomic regulation and control in 
the earlier period only resolved the superficial effects of the 
problems. Also, the various reform measures implemented this 
year have not been in place for a long time. Thus, if we want 
the economy to enter a fine cycle, we need to continue to make 
great efforts. 
  [JINGJI RIBAO] In response to the new changes in current 
economic life, what new policies should we adopt? 
  [Qiu] In terms of the macroeconomy, the new changes which 
have appeared in economic life at present are mainly changes, 
whereby the resource restraints of an earlier period--restraints 
in terms of energy, raw resources and transport--have been 
changed into market restraints. That is to say, whether or a 
not a product has a market has become an important factor in 
whether an enterprise's production operations are good or bad. 
This change was due to the control of the transitional, 
speculative, short-term demand of the earlier period and to 
contradictions where products were not suited to the market or 
were unable to keep up with market changes becoming increasingly 
prominent. To a certain degree this reflected the fact that 
attempts to optimize the deployment of resources lagged behind 
the development of the situation. 
  The appearance of this situation required, at the same time 
as deepening reform, a further improvement of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. That is to say, there is a need to 
switch from mainly controlling overall volumes to considering 
both control of overall volumes and structural readjustment, and 
a switch from mainly considering the macroeconomy to taking both 
macroeconomic and microeconomic considerations into account. 
Regulatory and control measures must be shifted from mainly 
monetary policies to those where both monetary and fiscal 
policies are utilized. As for the targets of regulation and 
control, we must switch from mainly short-term targets to the 
consideration of both short-term and long-term targets. 
Short-term targets refers to stabilizing prices and controlling 
inflation. Long-term targets refers to the healthy and 
sustained development of the economy. As to what is 
specifically needed at present, first, we must ensure that 
fixed-assets investment is maintained at an appropriate scale 
and that the investment structure is rational. Second, we need 
to implement various agricultural policies and strive to achieve 
a good harvest.

<F P=106> [By Li Hong: "Low-cost Housing to Benefit Millions"] </F>
  [Text] A government project to provide low-cost housing to 
millions of middle-income citizens will be launched next year, 
according to the Ministry of Construction. 
  The programme, called "comfort housing project," will enable 
most urban residents to buy houses for 1,000 yuan ($115) per 
square metre, 3,000 yuan ($345) less than the current market 
rate. 
  Real estate developers participating in the 
government-subsidized project will get free access to State 
land, tax breaks and other premiums in order to reduce building 
costs, said Liang Xiaoqing of the ministry's real estate 
department. 
  She said the Ministry of Construction will encourage 
overseas 
investment by offering attractive returns, albeit without 
staggering profits. 
  The "comfort housing project" is expected to provide 150 
million square metres of living space by the time it is finished 
in 1997. The ministry expects it will benefit about 2 million 
urban families. 
  The recent decrease in the supply of affordable housing led 
the central government to launch the project, ministry officials 
said. 
  A report from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) shows that 
moderately-priced housing development has been on a continous 
decline since 1985. The year-on-year decrease was 6.8 percent 
in 1986, plunged by 22.7 percent in 1987, dropped another 4.5 
percent in 1988, and nose-dived 27 percent in 1989. 
  Since 1990, the country has been caught in a real estate 
boom 
focusing on luxury office buildings, hotels, plush apartments 
and villas--all of which are beyond the means of ordinary 
Chinese residents. 
  On the other hand, demand for cheap urban dwellings has 
soared. Last year, the number of city households that had less 
than 4 square metres of living space per capita reached 5.5 
million. 
  And the number is expected to grow by 400,000 annually to 
reach 8 million by the year 2000, as more young people get 
married and start families, Liang said. 
  The central government started to cool down the over-heated 
property market last July. Bank credits were put under control 
and developers were required to make a fifth of their projects 
low-price residential housing. 
  To ensure the massive project gets off to a smooth start, 
the 
government will help fund it, Liang said. 
  The appropriations will be included in the annual State 
budget on fixed assets investment, which is to be approved by 
the nation's top legislature at its plenary session next, March. 
The planned investment for 1995 is 10 billion yuan ($1.15 
billion), Liang said. 
  Local governments and businesses will be required to raise 
the rest of the money for the project, she said. 
  To date, 64 cities have presented their plans for review by 
the Ministry of Construction. 
  Liang warned that many financially-strained State-owned 
firms 
may be unprepared to invest in the projects. In Beijing, for 
instance, about 30 percent of State companies are running in the 
red, she said. 
  Liang also said the planned selling price of 2,000 yuan 
($230) per square metre in Beijing was too high. 
  "They should reduce the price for the good of the Beijing 
people," Liang said. 
  She added that Shanghai, also a big metropolis, set a 1,000 
yuan ($115) per square metre ceiling on its "comfort housing 
project" apartments. 
  But Beijing officials said they had difficulty lowering the 
price since the building cost per square metre was 3,500 Yuan 
($402) in the capital.

<F P=106> [By Renee Lai] </F>
  [Text] A senior official of the People's Bank of China 
expects the yuan to remain stable because of the country's 
strong foreign exchange reserves and its ability to control 
soaring prices, and has dismissed concern about further 
depreciation. 
  Worries have been lingering that the Chinese currency will 
decline further following its effective 33 per cent devaluation 
against the U.S. dollar since January 1, when Beijing scrapped 
the two-tier yuan rate. 
  The yuan has been trading in a tight band of seven to 8.6 to 
the dollar. 
  Tan Zhuohuai, vice-director of the central bank for 
Guangdong 
province, gave the assurance to foreign investors at a seminar 
yesterday in Hong Kong. 
  He said a fall in the yuan would depend on the result of 
China's fight against inflation and the management of its forex 
reserves. 
  Mr Tan described China's economic policy as "neither a 
control, nor an easing", but a combination of both measures. He 
said price rises were inevitable under the reforms, but it was 
necessary to keep them at an appropriate level. 
  Beijing had shown its ability in containing price increases 
through the 13 per cent price rise last year, which had been 
largely controlled by the government. 
  Mr Tan cited China's foreign assets of more than U.S.$200 
billion and forex reserves of $29 billion last year as evidence 
of sufficient backup. Chinese banks had a forex balance of 
about $4 billion. 
  That strength was underscored by the fact that the yuan had 
been picking up since the start of the year. 
  "The ultimate aim of foreign exchange management is to relax 
control, allowing the yuan to be an international currency and 
freely convertible," Mr Tan said. 
  China had lifted forex control on current accounts such as 
imports and exports, while its grip remained tight on capital 
accounts. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Tan said China had adjusted its structure of 
fund allocation to cash-strapped state-owned enterprises. 
  "It is not a question of a credit squeeze or an easing of 
liquidity now, but a selective policy to guarantee the liquidity 
of key enterprises," he said. 
  He pointed to key infrastructure projects, more efficient 
enterprises and purchases of foreign trade products and 
agricultural products as priorities. 
  Dong Xinbao, professor of Tsinghua University's School of 
Economics and Management, said the investment environment in 
China was better than last year.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Importers Dominate Domestic Tool Mart"] </F>
  [Text] More than half of China's machine tool market has 
been captured by overseas manufacturers. 
  China imported $1.94 billion worth of machine tools last 
year, almost doubling the 1992 figure of $912 million. 
  Now the country has become the world's second largest 
machine 
tools importer, after the United States, said Liang Xunxuan, 
president of the China Machine Tool &amp; Tool Builders' 
Association 
(CMTBA). 
  The domestic machine tool market has been expanding at over 
18 per cent per annum in the past decade Liang said. 
  Total market consumption reached $3.58 billion last year, 
making the mainland the third largest market in the world. 
  Imported products dominated about 54 per cent of the 
country's machine tool market. 
  During the first quarter of this year, imports amounted to 
$479 million, up 80.6 per cent over the same period last year. 
  Taiwan surpassed Japan and Germany last year to become the 
largest exporter to the mainland. 
  Meanwhile, China has become a major machine tools producer. 
CMTBA now has more than 1,500 member enterprises. 
  The total output value of the industry reached $1.86 billion 
last year, making China the world's fifth largest machine tool 
producer. 
  China's exports during the first quarter of the year reached 
$42 million, up 24 per cent over the same period of last year. 
  Liang said that China's market will continue to expand since 
the government is making efforts to develop the transport, 
energy and telecommunications sectors. 
  To strengthen exchanges with other countries, Liang led a 
delegation to Britain last month and will visit Italy in 
September. 
  The 4th China International Machine Tool Show (CIMT'95) is 
scheduled to be held next year in Beijing to promote 
Sino-foreign co-operations in the machine tool industry.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "War Intensifies on Book Piracy"] </F>
  [Text] Police forces across the country have been cracking 
down on the sale of illegally-published and pornographic books 
following the issuance of a circular from China's main 
publication agency. 
  The directive from the Press and Publication Administration 
(PPA) requires its regional branches to cooperate with local 
Public Security organs in starting a comprehensive search for 
pirated books and pornographic materials. 
  China's publishing industry is a combination of State-owned 
printing houses, of which there are about 300, and over 60,000 
privately-run or collectively-run printing workshops and book 
dealers. The PPA says that the private sector of the industry 
is the main target of scrutiny. 
  Unlike large-sized publishers which have licenses to print 
books, many small printing houses often break regulations in 
order to make quick profits, said Huang Xiaoxin from the PPA's 
distribution department. 
  They often illegally print best-sellers, reference works and 
indecent materials. 
  The PPA estimates that out of the country's 100,000 new 
publications each year, some 1,500 titles are pirated. 
  The nationwide battle against illegal and indecent 
publications has been particularly successful in Hunan and 
Guangdong provinces and Beijing where printing houses and 
backroom printing shops have been closed down and main offenders 
arrested, Huang said. 
  According to PPA investigations, Hunan has over 4,000 small 
printing shops. In Changsha, the provincial capital, one shop 
was discovered to have been distributing pornographic books. 
The Guoxiao Book Shop had sold over 100,000 sexually offensive 
books to other shops in 27 provinces and municipalities. 
  So far, 13 of the prime culprits have been arrested by 
police 
in connection with the Guoxiao case alone, Huang said. 
  Also in Hunan, a county printing house was closed down for 
illegally printing 250,000 copies of the Xinhua Dictionary, the 
most popular dictionary among students. 
  When police raided the premises some 50,000 illegal copies 
were confiscated. 
  All those arrested for piracy in Hunan are awaiting trial, 
Huang said. 
  Meanwhile, police in Jiangsu Province have apprehended a 
35-year-old book merchant for pirating over a period of several 
years. 
  Lu Ping, from Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, was 
found to have made profits of 3 million yuan ($345,000) from his 
illegal business. 
  Lu is now awaiting trial. If found guilty he could face the 
death penalty, Huang added. 
  In Guangdong Province, investigators have discovered piracy 
involving a novel, "Zeng Guofan," which is about the famous Qing 
Dynasty (1644-1911) general who put down the Heavenly Kingdom 
uprisings. 
  Huang said that he expected more printing house closures and 
arrests as the crackdown gained momentum.

<F P=106> [By Reporters Fan Xinzhu (5400 2956 4554) and Si Hanke (0674 </F>
3352 4430): "Conscientiously Resolve Difficulties, Carry Forward 
Property Rights Reform"] 
  [Text] The reform of the property rights system of 
state-owned small-sized enterprises has been comprehensively 
carried forward throughout Heilongjiang, and the situation is 
good. This is what the reporters were informed at the forum on 
the property rights reform of Heilongjiang's state-owned 
small-sized enterprises, which concluded in Suihua on 9 June. 
Vice Governor Cong Fukui attended and addressed the forum. 
  According to the introduction, the reform of the property 
rights system has been carried out in an all-round way among the 
state-owned small-sized enterprises in our province. By the end 
of March this year, 1,208 out of the 2,954 state-owned 
small-sized enterprises in our province had carried out property 
rights system reform, accounting for 41 percent. Of them, 104 
became shareholding enterprises; 157, shareholding cooperative 
enterprises; 53, enterprises transformed with advanced 
technology and funds from abroad; 303, enterprises managed on a 
leasing basis; 109, enterprises with multiple systems; 113, 
enterprises with contracted assets; 103, enterprises closed down 
and suspended; 47, bankrupt enterprises; 29, enterprises selling 
assets, 126, enterprises separating ownership from management 
right, and 64, enterprises other than the above. The reform has 
attained the results of strengthening the enterprises' vigor, 
stabilizing the society, maintaining and increasing the value of 
state-owned assets, and alleviating enterprises' contradiction 
in the shortage of funds. It not only brought about direct 
economic efficiency but also created a good start for further 
developing the property rights reform. 
  Cong Fukui requested at the forum: In the future work of 
property rights reform, we should emancipate our minds, have the 
courage to make a breakthrough, and practice boldly. In 
reforming property rights, we should particularly resolve all 
difficulties. He said: Transforming mechanism, increasing 
vigor, improving reform, enhancing strength, unloading the 
burden, decreasing the pressure, and promoting the development 
of enterprises are the aims of enterprise property rights reform 
as well as the difficulties that need to be conscientiously 
resolved. 
  Much importance should be attached to transforming 
mechanisms, strengthening management, and solving the problems 
of deficient vigor. Enterprises which implement property rights 
reform should operate with a new management mechanism. 
Therefore, in property rights reform, we should conscientiously 
carry out the two "regulations"; grasp the work of transforming 
enterprise management mechanism; grasp the work of adjusting 
enterprises' organizational structure; grasp the work of 
building a modern enterprise management system and strengthening 
enterprises' management; and especially establish the company 
constitution, do business in accordance with rules, manage 
strictly, enforce discipline strictly, etc... 
  We should pay attention to strengthening technological 
transformation to increase the reserve strength and resolve 
enterprises' problems of deficient strength. 
  The enterprises which implement property rights reform 
should 
lay particular emphasis on using stock-holder' funds in 
technological transformation to strengthen enterprises' 
competition ability. 
  We should lay stress on transforming government functions, 
doing a good job in service, and resolving enterprises' problems 
of having too much pressure. 
  The government must strengthen guidance to enterprises, do a 
good job in service, and create a good external environment for 
enterprises to implement property rights reform. The government 
should take the responsibility for social welfare, make 
enterprises gradually turn the function of supporting social 
welfare to the government, and, furthermore, under certain 
conditions, divert and separate personnel to develop production 
and business. 
  Much importance should be attached to perfecting the old-age 
and unemployment insurance systems to eliminate enterprises' 
trouble back at home. 
  In this year, breakthrough should be attained in improving 
the old-age and unemployment insurance systems. The means to 
achieve the breakthrough is to develop real social insurance, 
whose funds should be paid by three parties, namely staff 
members and workers, enterprises, and the state. In the mean 
time, we should step up efforts to explore as well as build a 
unified social insurance institution, which supervises, checks, 
controls, and makes use of the insurance fund. We should 
guarantee the effective operation of the company system and 
prevent change in forms but not in contents and taking the old 
road. Responsibility and right should be clearly defined to 
make the investors enjoy, according to their capital invested, 
the proportioned rights of choosing managerial personnel, being 
benefited from assets, and important policymaking. The rights, 
responsibilities, and benefits of shareholders, the board of 
directors, and managers should be defined scientifically and 
clearly so that they establish a relationship, in which the 
three parties restrict each other, to insure the effective 
operation of the company system.

develop the good relations between the two countries. 
  Kliridhis also briefed the Chinese delegation on the latest 
development of the Cyprus problem. 
  Luo Gan, who arrived here with his delegation late Thursday 
[16 June] night for a good will visit to Cyprus, said China 
attached great importance to the relations between the two 
countries and appreciated smooth development of the good 
relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries. 
  "We also enjoy good cooperations in the international field 
and share similar views on many international issues," Luo told 
the president, and hoped such cooperation would be further 
strengthened. 
  On Cyprus issue, which has lasted for 20 years, Luo said 
China supports the maintenance of the island's independence, 
sovereignty and territorial integrity and supports the United 
Nations in its effort to solve the long standing issue. 
  Luo and his delegation also met and held talks today with 
Acting Foreign Minister, Interior Minister Konstandinos 
Mikhailidhis. 
  Reliable sources told XINHUA that during the talks, the two 
sides discussed bilateral relations, economic and trade 
cooperation as well as the Cyprus problem. 
  After the talks in the Foreign Ministry, the delegation met 
President of the House of Representatives Alexis Galanos [name 
as received]. 
  Cyprus is the delegation's first leg in their regional tour, 
which will also take them to Tunisia and Libya. 
  The Chinese delegation is expected to leave the island 
Sunday.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 20 (XINHUA) -- All Democratic 
Cambodia Party (DKP) staff flew out of Puchentong Airport today 
for a DKP controlled area, following an order by Cambodia's 
Ministry of Interior Affairs last Friday [17 June]. 
  According to observers this indicates that the Cambodian 
Government has effectively severed all contact with the DKP and 
closed the door on peace talks and national reconciliation. 
  Before leaving, Tap Kunnal, the DKP's representative, 
released a message thanking people at all levels who have, in 
various ways, shown their support. 
  The message also expressed the DKP's "regret at having to 
leave Phnom Penh...for a while." 
  Tap Kunnal's message said that the DKP had come to work in 
Phnom Penh in compliance with the 4-party Paris Agreement and 
with the approval of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. This 
was to facilitate and maintain communication between the two 
groups with the aim of fostering mutual understanding until full 
national reconciliation. 
  Following last Friday's official instruction DKP staff were 
given a deadline of June 19 for departure from Phnom Penh. 
  However, as visas could not be obtained from the embassy 
during the weekend holiday, the government had agreed to a 
one-day delay for their departure. 
  The DKP's message stressed that this was only a temporary 
situation and that they sincerely hoped could return one day. 
[sentence as received] 
  It added that they would pray for the quickest possible 
realization of national reconciliation and unity in a united, 
independent and peaceful Cambodia.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The 29th meeting of 
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) opened here today 
after a half-year suspension. 
  Prior to the meeting, both sides expressed the hope that 
they 
can make some progress through the meeting. 
  Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese side, said 
the JLG should speed up its work, however that requires efforts 
from both sides. 
  "There are only three years left between now and 1997 and 
there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss." 
  He revealed the Chinese side would bring some subjects for 
the discussion of JLG at this meeting. The objective is to 
ensure a smooth transition in Hong Kong. 
  British senior representative H. L. Davies said, "we can use 
the next three days to advance things as fast as we can." 
  He also said, "when we met in London, the weather was not 
very good. I am glad to say today's weather is sunshiny. The 
forecast for the next three days is even better so I am 
confident we will make progress." 
  The Chinese senior representative said in reply, "let's join 
our efforts." The previous JLG meeting was held in London 
between December 7 and 9 last year. It was reported that the 
current meeting will focus such subjects as military land issue, 
localization of laws and passport issue.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Vice Foreign Affairs 
Minister Chen Hsi-fan said Monday [20 June] he is not optimistic 
about the possibility of President Li Teng-hui's desired visit 
to the United States. 
  Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, 
Chen said that although several American congressmen have 
invited Li to visit the United States, the invitation does not 
represent the American Government's stance. 
  "Without the US Government's approval, President Li still 
cannot visit America," Chen noted. 
  As the US administration still insists on its so-called "one 
China" policy, he said the chances for Li to visit the United 
States remain slim. 
  Chen said the US is expected to finalize a comprehensive 
review of its policy toward the Republic of China [ROC] at the 
end of this month, and may allow the ROC to rename its 
representative office in America to make its presence more 
conspicuous. 
  Taiwan's representative office in the US is currently called 
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs. The ROC 
has long hoped to change the title to the "Taipei Representative 
Office." 
  Barring unexpected developments, Chen said, the US will 
approve the renaming proposal when it makes public the results 
of its Taiwan policy review. 
  Reports from Washington said the Clinton administration may 
also ease restrictions on high-level contacts with Taiwan in 
response to mounting congressional calls for upgrading ties with 
Taipei. 
  The reports said the United States may not formally announce 
the lifting of its ban on high-level contacts with Taiwan, but 
it will instead send suitable ministerial-level officials to 
visit Taiwan at appropriate times in the future. 
  In late 1992, then US Trade Representative Carla A. Hills 
became the highest-level incumbent American official to visit 
Taiwan since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979. 
  The reports said the US State Department completed a 60-page 
review of the country's policy toward Taiwan late last year. 
The document was, however, then shelved because of escalating 
tensions between Washington and Beijing over the renewal of the 
mainland's most-favored-nation trade status. Because the issue 
has been resolved, the reports said, the Clinton administration 
is scheduled to publish the review in late June.

  [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- A visit to the United 
States by Republic of China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui would be 
beneficial for both countries, Raymond Tai, deputy 
secretary-general to Li, said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  At a regular press conference at the presidential office, 
Tai 
said that Li would be glad to accept the invitation to visit the 
United States extended to him by U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski 
(R-Alaska) and Hank Brown (R-Colorado), but that his willingness 
to visit could not by itself guarantee that a visit will come 
off, given that the invitation did not come from the Clinton 
administration itself. 
  However, a Li visit to the United States would be good for 
the economic and trade relationship and cultural interflow 
between the two countries, Tai noted. 
  Taiwan is the sixth-largest trading partner of the United 
States and along with the United States is a member of the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Tai said. He quoted Li 
as saying that if given the chance, he would also visit Britain, 
France, Germany, or any place a visit would benefit Taiwan.

  [Excerpts] According to the arrangement made by the CPC 
Central Committee for cadres to study the theories and the study 
arrangement made the theoretical study central group under the 
provincial party committee, the theoretical study central group 
held its third study meeting of 1994 presided over by Comrade He 
Zhukang in Changchun from 2 to 4 June. 
  The study meeting is aimed at studying in an overall way the 
Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
emphatically studying the theories of socialist market economy 
based on accurately understanding and grasping the whole 
situation in the work of the entire party and country as a 
whole, and further upgrading the capability of having the 
socialist market economy well in hand and the level of leading 
the work in the market economy by integrating the study with 
that of basic knowledge of modern science and technology. 
[passage omitted] 
  The central group contended that in engaging in the 
socialist 
market economy, a good job should be done in handling the 
integration in theory and practice between the market economy 
and the social system. Enterprises are the most important norms 
of markets. In developing the market economy, emphasis should 
be placed on emancipating the mind, seizing the opportunity, 
deepening the reform among enterprises, and establishing modern 
enterprise systems. [passage omitted] 
  The central group contended that commodity prices are the 
essential factors of markets and that a success in the price 
reform represents a precondition for establishing the systems of 
socialist market economy. [passage omitted] 
  The central group contended that the state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises are the pillar of the national economy 
and are the main sources of the state financial revenues. They 
made or are making great and important contributions to the 
national economy. Boosting the large and medium-sized 
enterprises has a bearing on the whole situation in deepening 
the reform, developing the economy, and maintaining social 
stability. Thus, it is imperative to resolutely boost them 
without fail. [passage omitted] 
  The central group urged the theoretical study central groups 
of party committees at all levels and the broad masses of cadres 
to implement the spirit of the circular issued by the General 
Office of the CPC Central Committee and to earnestly study the 
modern scientific and technological knowledge while consciously 
studying the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the 
theories and basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. 
The group also urged them to enhance their sense in science and 
technology and to continuously upgrade their level in the work 
of making scientific and technological policy decisions as well 
as urged leading cadres to set example or take the lead in study.

<F P=106> [Liu Lida, deputy director of the provincial tax bureau, </F>
answers questions raised by a reporter on strengthening 
management over receipts and guaranteeing the smooth 
implementation of the new tax system--date and place not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] After the practice of the new tax system, 
particularly since the recent period, the criminal activities of 
lawless people on forging, reselling, and stealing receipts and 
using receipts to engage in tax evasion, cheating, smuggling, 
trafficking in smuggled goods, and profiteering have run rampant 
in some areas across the country, particularly in some coastal 
areas. What is the situation in our province? 
  [Liu Lida] Our province also has this situation. Judging 
from the situation of our province's inspection of the 
value-added tax special receipts, some problems have existed. 
The comparatively prominent ones are first, the forging and 
reselling of receipts. Shenyang and Fuxin have successively 
investigated and handled this kind of case. Second, the items 
to be filled in while writing the receipts are not complete; 
third, some people fail to correctly count the items to be 
filled in while writing the receipts; fourth, some people write 
false items in a real receipt which are manifested in 
arbitrarily writing the names of units or understating the value 
of items in the receipts and expanding the scope of items to be 
filled in the receipts. 
  [Reporter] Recently, the State General Administration of 
Taxation, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held 
a "nationwide telephone conference on launching a special 
struggle against the law-breaking criminal activities of 
forging, reselling, and stealing receipts," and decided to 
launch a special struggle against the law-breaking criminal 
activities of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts in the 
whole country. I think this is very necessary. 
  [Liu Lida] It is very necessary to launch activities on 
dealing blows to the law-breaking criminal activities of 
forging, reselling, and stealing receipts. 
  After the implementation of the new tax system, particularly 
since the use of value-added tax special receipts, receipts no 
long simply serve as a firsthand proof of the ordinary receipts 
in the past, as a proof of keeping accounts, and as a basis for 
tax checkup. More importantly, they serve as a proof for tax 
payments. The value-added tax special receipts serve as a 
"chain" holding all commodity circulation links together. When 
a receipt is written, it implies that this receipt can be served 
as an income tax payment. If problems occur in any link, this 
"chain" will break off and taxation will be unable to calculate 
accurately. In a written instruction on dealing blows to 
law-breaking criminal activities on forging and reselling 
receipts, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out: "Forging the 
value-added tax special receipts is extremely harmful (even more 
harmful than making counterfeit banknotes). If we do not put 
several persons to death (or sentence them to life 
imprisonment), perhaps, we will be unable to check this trend." 
  [Reporter] Evidently, the value-added tax special receipts 
have played a role in tax reduction. This is not only the new 
distinguishing feature and crux of the value-added tax but also 
the direct reason for criminal elements to make a reckless move 
to forge, resell, steal, and write false value-added tax special 
receipts. 
  [Liu Lida] Your analysis is correct. Just think. If we fail 
to manage the special receipts well, great losses of state 
taxation will surely be created and reform of the tax system 
will also be a failure. So, we should discard the past concept 
of managing ordinary receipts, further enhance understanding, 
regard the management of special receipts as an important means 
for guaranteeing the smooth implementation of reform of the tax 
system, and strengthen the sense of responsibility and urgency. 
  [Reporter] At present, the law-breaking criminal activities 
of using receipts to engage in tax evasion and cheating have 
become a common nuisance in society. As far as our province is 
concerned, what measures should we take to check them resolutely? 
  [Liu Lida] In line with this special struggle, our tax 
departments should continue to conduct checkups of the special 
receipts, unceasingly improve this system, go through the 
procedures carefully, and explore ways to check up receipts 
under the new situation. However, this problem involves many 
sectors, and most of these law-breaking criminal activities are 
usually carried out covertly. It will be hard to discover and 
solve them by relying only on the checkups of the tax 
departments. Therefore, the tax departments must maintain close 
coordination with the public security, judicial, and 
procuratorial departments under the guidance and support of the 
party and government leaders, take joint actions, and establish 
organs for organizing this special struggle. If the 
law-breaking criminal acts of forging, reselling, and stealing 
receipts discovered during the checkup of receipts constitute a 
crime, the people involved should be transferred to the 
judicial organs for punishment in an effort to publicize the 
legal system and to frighten the criminals. Meanwhile, we 
should pay special attention to receipt propaganda work, enhance 
the sense of legally using receipts in the whole society, let 
the broad masses of people understand the importance of managing 
receipts and the harmfulness of forging and reselling receipts. 
In addition, we should also pay attention to mobilizing the 
enthusiasm of the broad masses of value-added tax payers, and 
make them voluntarily report the situation of the counterfoils 
of the value-added tax special receipts on time so that tax 
departments can accurately keep abreast of the situation in a 
timely manner. 
  At present, the special struggle against the law-breaking 
criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts 
have been gradually carried out in all localities across the 
province. I believe that with the support of leaders at all 
levels and the coordination of the public security, judicial, 
and procuratorial departments, this work will surely attain its 
expected aim, the management of receipts will be unceasingly 
strengthened in our province, and a good environment for 
guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the new tax system 
will be created.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The increasing number 
of foreign friendship ties has boosted the economy of northeast 
China's Liaoning Province, according to a local foreign affairs 
official. 
  The province has established friendship ties with 61 cities 
in 16 countries around the world, accounting for 10 percent of 
the country's total sister cities, according to the official. 
  It has also sent 1,500 students abroad and invited 130 
foreign experts to give lectures and advice on its economic 
development. 
  The countries involved include Japan, the United States, 
Britain, Italy, Russia and the Republic of Korea. Of the 61 
sister cities, 15 are Japanese. 
  The official said that over the past few years the province 
has received more than 150 visiting foreign delegations and it 
has sent abroad 120 delegations. 
  As bridges leading to the outside world, he said, the 
fast-growing relationships it has established help promote the 
province's economic development. It has so far signed over 250 
contracts for economic co-operation and built 65 joint ventures, 
involving more than 500 million yuan. 
  The province has used these ties to import 90 items of 
advanced equipment for technical transformation projects of old 
enterprises. 
  Liaoning has signed letters of intent to form similar ties 
with ten more foreign cities in the coming years.

<F P=106> [Speech delivered by Qian Qichen at the Fifth National </F>
Meeting of Representatives of Returned Overseas Chinese and 
Relatives of Overseas Chinese in Beijing on 14 June 1994: "Qian 
Qichen's Speech Made on Behalf of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council at the Fifth National Meeting of 
Representatives of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of 
Overseas Chinese on 14 June 1994] 
  [Text] Deputies and Comrades: 
  The Fifth National Meeting of Representatives of Returned 
Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese opened 
solemnly today. This is a significant meeting for the overseas 
Chinese sector, and is also a great event which the returned 
overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas Chinese, and the 
vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad, numbering more 
than 30 million, have universally followed with interest. The 
convocation of this meeting is of vital significance to further 
mobilizing the vast numbers of returned overseas Chinese and 
their relatives to conscientiously implement the guidelines of 
the 14th Party National Congress and the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and accelerating the 
development of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I 
should like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend our 
warm congratulations to this meeting; our best wishes to the 
vast number of returned overseas Chinese, the relatives of 
Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals residing abroad; our 
cordial greetings to the assiduous workers of overseas Chinese 
affairs; and our respects to the advanced collectives and 
individuals in overseas Chinese work, who will be commended at 
this meeting. 
  Returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of overseas 
Chinese, 
and the vast number of Chinese nationals residing abroad have 
made tremendous contributions to China's revolution and 
construction in various historical periods and have written an 
epic and historic chapter on the prosperity of the motherland 
and the progress and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. During 
the new historical period, the vast number of returned overseas 
Chinese and their relatives are active in the posts of various 
trades and professions. With a lofty sense of mission and 
responsibility, they have enthusiastically devoted themselves to 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization undertakings, 
have made brilliant achievements in bringing about economic 
development and social progress, and have played a positive role 
in the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the 
motherland. The vast number of Chinese nationals residing 
abroad are the most enthusiastic supporters of China's open-door 
policy, its effort to develop foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, and its scientific, technological, and cultural 
exchange activities. Advancing hand in hand with the local 
people, they have performed substantial work for the prosperity 
and progress of the countries where they are residing as well as 
for the development of friendly ties between these countries and 
China. They have demonstrated utterly sincere feelings for the 
reform and construction of the motherland. 
  The period between now and the middle of next century will 
be 
a great historic period of national rejuvenation and the 
realization of socialist modernization in China. In the 1990's, 
we will strive to achieve the second-step objective of 
quadrupling GNP ahead of schedule so that the people will be 
able to lead a relatively comfortable life, and the socialist 
market economic structure will be initially established. In 
line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, we will resume our 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao as scheduled and will 
maintain long-term stability and prosperity there. We will also 
push forward the great cause of reunifying the motherland in 
accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems." 
For these purposes, we must fully mobilize the initiative of 
the entire people, including the returned overseas Chinese, the 
relatives of overseas Chinese, and Chinese nationals residing 
abroad. They have the fine tradition of loving their motherland 
and home towns, and boast the advantage of extensive 
relationships with the people and rich information resources 
abroad. Hence, they are a major force in the country's drive 
for modernization and will certainly make greater contributions 
to the magnificent cause of rejuvenating and reunifying the 
motherland. 
  This is a crucial year for China's socialist modernization 
process. "Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
wider to the outside world, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability" are the tasks on which the overall 
interest of the entire party and country hinges. The Overseas 
Chinese affairs work should be consciously subordinate to and 
serve this overall interest. Closely centering around this 
overall interest, we must seriously put into practice various 
principles and policies on Overseas Chinese affairs work in the 
new period, must extensively unite and mobilize the returned 
overseas Chinese and their relatives to devote themselves to 
reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, must 
enthusiastically promote trade and economic cooperation as well 
as scientific, technological, and cultural exchange between the 
Overseas Chinese and the motherland, must maintain social 
stability, and must give impetus to economic development and 
comprehensive social progress. The vast number of overseas 
Chinese affairs workers should do all they can to forge ahead 
with one heart and one mind in a bid to initiate a new situation 
for Overseas Chinese affairs work. 
  The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese is 
a mass organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives 
of Overseas Chinese throughout the country under the party 
leadership, and is a bridge and link between them and the party 
and government. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, the federations of returned Overseas Chinese 
at various levels have exercised a significant role in reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive. The vast number of 
cadres of these federations have worked diligently and have made 
brilliant achievements. Under the new situation, they are faced 
with even heavier tasks, and their position and role are even 
more important. The federations at various levels should be 
guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, should adhere to the party's basic 
line, should perform their work with an emphasis on economic 
construction, and should exercise their functions in a 
comprehensive way. They should exploit their own advantages 
and, through their effective work, further mobilize and unite 
the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives across the 
country to devote greater efforts to pushing forward the 
undertakings of reform, opening up, and modernization in China. 
It is necessary to fully exercise the role of the returned 
Overseas Chinese and their relatives in participating in the 
deliberation and administration of state affairs and in 
democratic supervision. Their legitimate rights and interests 
in the country should be protected in accordance with the law. 
It is also necessary to fully exploit the advantages of the 
federations of returned Overseas Chinese in conducting 
nongovernmental exchange and increasing contact with foreign 
countries. We should give enthusiastic assistance to the 
returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese, 
and Chinese nationals residing abroad in their efforts to run 
cultural, educational, public health, and other social welfare 
undertakings in the country. Besides, it is necessary to bring 
into full play the role of the federations of returned Overseas 
Chinese in the building of socialist spiritual civilization and 
make further efforts to strengthen such building in their home 
towns. Through intensified reform and building, we should train 
a contingent of overseas affairs workers who have both ability 
and political integrity and who will enthusiastically serve the 
returned Overseas Chinese, the relatives of Overseas Chinese, 
and Chinese nationals residing abroad. The work of the 
federations of returned Overseas Chinese should be geared to the 
needs of the grass-roots units and should go deep into the 
realities of life. They should earnestly propagate and explain 
the party's principles and policies and the important measures 
on reform and opening up to the returned Overseas Chinese and 
their relatives, get acquainted with their aspirations, show 
concern for their weal and woe, and convey their views and 
demands to the party and government in good time. These 
federations should be built into vigorous and energetic "homes 
of returned Overseas Chinese and their relatives" which are 
trusted by the broad masses. 
  Deputies and comrades, the party and government always pay 
serious attention to the role of the returned Overseas Chinese, 
the relatives of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese nationals 
residing abroad in revolution and construction, as well as to 
the work of overseas affairs. Under the new situation, the 
party and government at all levels should further intensify and 
improve leadership over overseas affairs work, should give full 
rein to the initiative of the federations, and should 
enthusiastically show concern for and give support to their 
work. I profoundly believe that, after the current meeting, a 
brand new situation of unity and endeavor in overseas affairs 
work will certainly emerge. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the leadership of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, let us firmly 
seize the opportunity, do solid work, forge ahead, and make 
great efforts to build China into a prosperous, democratic, 
civilized, and modernized socialist country and to safeguard 
world peace and development! 
  I wish the meeting complete success!

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- In the remaining years 
of this century, China aims to use at least seven billion U.S. 
dollars of overseas capital for the construction of posts and 
telecommunications facilities. 
  Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of posts and 
telecommunications, 
said here today in an exclusive interview with XINHUA that since 
1984, the ministry has used foreign funds of 5.67 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  The ministry hopes to use another batch of 2.1 billion U.S. 
dollars of foreign funds by the end of 1995, while the planned 
sum of foreign funds for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) 
period is five billion U.S. dollars, Wu added. 
  He said that in the past 10 years, with loans on favorable 
terms from foreign governments, international financial 
organizations and other overseas organizations and institutions, 
the ministry introduced some 16.8 million lines of 
program-controlled city telephone switch equipment and one 
million lines of long-distance switch equipment; constructed 
about 20,000 km of high-grade optical telecommunications cable 
lines and 15,000 km of digital micro-wave telecommunications 
lines; and set up 18 land satellite stations and 28 automated 
letter distribution lines. 
  "Foreign capital has given a great push to China's 
telecommunications construction," he said. 
  He said that China's fast economic development in the past 
few years has brought about a nice opportunity for the country's 
telecommunications development. However, being a basic 
industry, telecommunications has been suffering from 
insufficient infrastructures, which has, to some extent, also 
hampered the country's economic development. 
  To step up the construction of telecommunications 
infrastructures, the central government has drafted a series of 
preferential policies, and priority has been given to the 
industry in terms of using foreign funds. Considering the scale 
of China's telecommunications market, the ministry will be fully 
capable of repaying foreign investment, the minister said. 
  Telecommunications is one of China's industries with the 
fastest development speed. In 1992 its business volume 
increased by 42 percent; last year its growth rate rose to 59 
percent, while in the first five months of this year the rate of 
increase was 49.5 percent. 
  The high speed increase is closely related to China's huge 
input in this field. Last year the industry finished an 
investment of 40.4 billion yuan in fixed assets construction, 
and this year's budget rose abruptly to 53.6 billion yuan. The 
Eighth Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) will finish a total investment 
of 160 billion yuan, while in the newly-drafted Ninth Five-Year 
Plan the budget is a hefty 360 billion yuan. 
  Aside from a small amount of state allocations, most of the 
funds will come from domestic and overseas loans or be raised by 
various localities, Wu said. 
  He said that China will be the world's largest 
telecommunications market in the 21st century. So far nearly 
all of the world's large telecommunications groups have 
established cooperative relations with China, and some 
medium-sized and small enterprises are also preparing to have a 
share in this large market. This is really a good opportunity 
for China's telecommunications development. 
  Talking about foreign cooperation, Wu said that besides 
engaging in direct management of telecommunications businesses, 
or management through buying stock, overseas businessmen are 
welcome to cooperate in the fields such as scientific research, 
education, product development, engineering and design, and 
equipment production and supply. 
  He said that China especially welcomes overseas businessmen 
to invest in telecommunications construction projects. The 
Chinese side will ensure their interests according to the rule 
of mutual benefit. 
  He said that the production of telecommunications equipment 
is fully open to foreign businessmen. They can construct 
cooperative enterprises as well as solely-funded enterprises in 
China. 
  So far all of China's newly-built advanced 
telecommunications 
equipment production lines are fruits of Sino-foreign 
cooperation, such as the Sino-Belgium Switch Co. in Shanghai, 
Tianjin-NEC Co. and Beijing Siemens Co. Presently Guangdong 
Province is negotiating with Canadian Northern 
Telecommunications Co. on cooperative projects. 
  Wu, 56 years old and a senior engineer of 
telecommunications, 
was appointed minister of posts and telecommunications last year.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that China wishes to further its friendly ties 
and cooperation with all ASEAN countries on the basis of the 
five principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  He was speaking at a meeting with visiting Philippine 
Vice-President Joseph Estrada here this afternoon. 
  Li noted the smooth growth of bilateral exchanges and 
cooperation in every field since the two countries established 
diplomatic relations 19 years ago. 
  Estrada handed Li a letter from President Fidel V. Ramos, 
which expressed his country's sincere aspirations for expanding 
relations with China. 
  Ramos also reaffirmed in the letter that the Philippine 
Government fully supports the resumption of China's status as a 
contracting party in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
so as to enable it to become one of the founders of the World 
Trade Organization. 
  Estrada repeated the Philippine Government's "One-China" 
stand and, on behalf of his government, expressed its concern 
for the flood-stricken provinces in south China. 
  Li expressed appreciation for the Philippines' "One-China" 
stand. He described Ramos' visit to China last year as 
successful and asked Estrada to convey President Jiang Zemin's 
and his greetings to Ramos.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said today that Sino-Philippine 
links had enjoyed rapid growth since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations. 
  He told Philippine Vice-President Joseph Estrada during 
their 
meeting here this afternoon that economic, trade and cultural 
cooperation between the two countries was satisfactory. 
  Since both countries were committed to economic development 
to improve people's lives, it would benefit them to increase 
exchanges and further improve understanding. 
  He also briefed the guest on the work of the CPPCC, which he 
said would like to have exchanges and cooperation with relevant 
parties in the Philippines to push forward the Sino-Philippine 
links. 
  Estrada spoke highly of China's opening-to-the-world drive 
and great economic achievements. 
  He stressed that his current visit was to enhance 
understanding and further bilateral relations.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The Philippine 
Government and people wish to see China "playing a positive role 
in political, economic and security matters in the Asia-Pacific 
region as a stabilizing influence in the maintenance of peace 
and tranquility." 
  This was stated by visiting Philippine Vice President Joseph 
Estrada in an exclusive interview with XINHUA before he left 
here for Shanghai today. 
  China's rapid economic development in recent years has been 
astonishing to the extent that the country is making efforts to 
cut its growth rate while other countries are seeking higher 
growth rates, Estrada said. 
  He noted that the Philippine Government would like to see a 
stronger China in the region. 
  The Philippine Government does not have any fears about a 
stronger China and "sees no threat from China," Estrada said, 
adding "maybe some western countries do." but as for the 
Philippines and other Asian countries, they want all their 
neighbors to become stronger. 
  Sitting comfortably beside a dinner table in a villa of the 
Diaoyutai state guesthouse where the vice-president stayed 
during his visit to Beijing, he talked softly with occasional 
rises in his voice for emphasis, seemingly with a clear-cut 
rhythm, fully demonstrating his conversational skills as an 
eminent film star. 
  Before assuming his current post in 1992, the vice-president 
had been a popular actor in the Philippines, staging more than 
100 films in his 25-year career and starring in many of them. 
  He described his current visit to China, his first China 
tour, as "quite a success", having met Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren, Premier Li Peng, the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi and many other senior 
officials. What satisfied him most was the signing of a trade 
protocol between the two governments which is expected to help 
further boost the vibrant trade to an annual volume of 400 
million U.S. dollars and enhance economic cooperation between 
the two countries. His coming to China is itself an indication 
of the Philippine Government's high regard for China, he 
stressed. 
  The exchanges of visits by senior officials of the two 
countries over the past few years have helped strengthen the 
healthy bilateral relations, especially in the fields of 
economic cooperation, science and technology and culture. 
China, already a "very important player in international 
affairs," is naturally encouraged to assume "an active role in 
economic and security regional discussions," such as the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Conference and the ASEAN regional forum, 
the vice-president stated.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dialogue on Human Rights Should Be </F>
Conducted on an Objective and Just Basis"] 
  [Text] In its long article published on 8 June, China's 
Society for the Study of Human Rights refuted with incontestable 
data and objective analyses the criticism of China's human 
rights conditions contained in the China section of the human 
rights report issued by the U.S. State Department in 1993. This 
has fully manifested China's open and aboveboard position on the 
human rights issue. 
  The Society for the Study of Human Rights justly and 
forcefully denounced the U.S. State Department's deliberate 
distortion and unwarranted accusations regarding China's human 
rights conditions, which once again proves that China has never 
evaded discussion or dialogue on human rights. What China 
resolutely opposes is merely the hegemonism with which one 
country imposes its own views on others, interferes in others' 
internal affairs, and exerts pressure on others under the 
pretext of the human rights issue. The United States has 
precisely given itself the mantle of an "international human 
rights judge," has vested itself with the "power" to 
unilaterally examine human rights conditions in other countries 
and to wantonly criticize others' political, economic, social, 
cultural, and judicial systems. This runs counter to the spirit 
of the "UN Charter." The United States' tyrannical act, in 
which "the common people are forbidden to light lamps while the 
magistrates are free to burn down houses," was refuted by the 
above-mentioned society on just grounds. It also clarified the 
United States' slander regarding China's human rights 
conditions. This is conducive to pushing forward the dialogue 
on human rights issues among members of the international 
community on an equal basis, conducting international 
cooperation, seeking common ground while reserving differences, 
and safeguarding and promoting the cause of human rights 
throughout the world. 
  The Society for the Study of Human Rights article first laid 
bare the U.S. double standard on human rights issues. For 
example, the United States attacked China's punishment of 
antirevolutionary criminals. In fact, China's criminal law 
unequivocally defines antirevolutionary crime as actions that 
jeopardize state security. Every country -- including the United 
States -- has stringent laws to punish crimes that jeopardize 
state security, and the punishment for such crimes is 
particularly severe in the United States. As for actions 
outside the law, the memory of the United States' cruel 
suppression of the black human rights movement and the student 
movement against the Vietnam War in the 1960's, in which troops 
were sent to fire on students in their campuses, are still fresh 
in people's minds. The various kinds of criminals imprisoned in 
the United States far outnumber those in China on a per capita 
basis, so on what basis is the United States criticizing China 
for its punishment of criminals who jeopardize state security? 
On what grounds can it criticize China for making 
"indiscriminate arrests"? As a matter of fact, the U.S. double 
standard on the above subject is aimed at interfering in and 
subverting other countries under the cover of the human rights 
issue. For example, "Operation Yellow Bird," with which many 
Hong Kong people are familiar, was a plan to interfere in 
China's internal affairs and subvert the Chinese Government. 
The plan was carried out precisely under the slogan of 
so-called "human rights," and the U.S. CIA had a hand in it. 
  In its human rights report, the U.S. State Department racked 
its brain to fabricate charges on China's human rights 
conditions, but they are in conflict with one another, as its 
unwarranted accusations are utterly groundless. The most ironic 
of all is that many of the report's accusations against China 
are in precisely those areas where China has performed much 
better than the United States. Take the so-called 
discrimination against women in China as an example. The status 
and rights of Chinese women are much better than those of 
American women. The United States also describes China as a 
country in which the people's lives and safety are not 
protected. Last January, the east coast of the United States 
and China's northern city of Harbin were both hit by 
exceptionally cold weather, and the temperature in Harbin was 
approximately 10 degrees Celsius lower than that in the east 
coast of the United States. While nobody died from the cold 
spell in Harbin, more than 130 people froze to death in 
Washington D.C. alone! This fact fully shows that the human 
rights conditions in the United States are not better than those 
in China, and in many areas are much worse. However, just 10 
days after more than 130 people died from the cold in the U.S. 
capital, the United States published a human rights report 
criticizing China and many other countries on their human rights 
conditions. Nothing is more preposterous than this. 
  As long as any one takes a fair and objective stance, he 
will 
be able to note that China's human rights conditions are 
constantly improving. New China has enabled one-fifth of the 
world's population to shake off the position of having no human 
rights at all and of being bullied, humiliated, and slaughtered 
by foreign hegemonists at will. Since the founding of the PRC 
approximately 40 years ago -- particularly after 15 years of 
reform and opening up -- the Chinese people, a population of 1.2 
billion, have basically resolved the problem of having adequate 
food and clothing and are advancing toward a moderate level of 
prosperity. 
  As the Chinese people are working and living in 
peace and contentment, the democratic politics and the building 
of the legal system in China are vigorously being strengthened, 
and the positive development trend of human rights in China has 
considerably promoted and contributed to the cause of human 
rights in the world. Instead of looking squarely at this fact, 
the United States is distorting and slandering China's human 
rights conditions by piecing together information from hearsay 
or from its own subjective conjecture in its human rights 
report, demonstrating its complete lack of a serious, fair, and 
objective attitude. 
  China has always maintained that, owing to the historical, 
cultural, social, and national conditions in different 
countries, there has never been a unified yardstick or pattern 
to follow in the human rights issue, and no country should 
impose its yardstick or pattern on others; still less should a 
country use this as an excuse to interfere in or even subvert 
other countries. Differences should be ironed out through a 
dialogue which is characterized by objectivity, fairness, and 
equality. Only by so doing can it contribute to world peace and 
progress. For example, on the issue of Sino-U.S. trade, China 
has always maintained that trade and human rights should be 
separated, and the latter should not be used as a weapon to wage 
a trade war or put pressure on others. China's position has won 
support from various countries, leaving the United States no 
alternative but to sever its link between trade and human rights 
in future trade with China. The long article published by the 
Society for the Study of Human Rights is, in essence, a dialogue 
on the human rights issue conducted with the United States on an 
equal footing and in an objective and fair attitude and 
position. The United States should realize that it has no 
authority to vest itself with the "power" to one-sidedly examine 
and criticize other countries' human rights conditions. It is 
advisable for the United States to hold human rights dialogues 
with various countries, particularly the vast number of 
developing countries, including China, sincerely and on an equal 
footing. Otherwise, if it continues to publish its one-sided 
reports examining other countries' human rights conditions year 
after year, it will only evoke dissatisfaction from various 
countries, the developing countries in particular, and will sink 
deeper and deeper into isolation.

  [Text] Washington, June 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton stressed here today that he expects changes to be made 
in his health care reform bill, but he remains adamant that it 
must be universal, meaning covering all Americans. 
  Clinton who is expected to lobby heavily for his health 
reform package this week, told a U.S. TV program this morning 
that health care doesn't have to be done tomorrow. It ought to 
be phased in over a period of just a few years. "But we ought 
not to walk away without a bill that provides health care to all 
Americans." 
  The President's health care package is now under siege in 
U.S. Congress. 
  U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, whose closely watched committee is considered crucial 
in shaping a final health reform plan, told a TV program Sunday 
[18 June] that there is no chance Congress will pass a bill with 
iron clad promises of health insurance for all Americans. But 
he held out the prospect of an abridged version in which health 
care would be available in about 10 years. 
  Moynihan and Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking minority member 
of the Finance Committee, delivered that message to Clinton last 
week. 
  The U.S. president said that he is aware that tens of 
millions of dollars "in special interest money" has been spent 
to convince people "that our plan is wrong." 
  "We needed to make some changes in our plan," Clinton added. 
"But I also know that the right thing for America is to do what 
every other advanced country has done in guaranteeing 
middle-class working people health care that can't be taken 
away. All I want to do is to give the American people what the 
president and the Congress and the federal government employees 
have," he said.

  [Text] Washington, June 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today urged U.S. business leaders to help win passage of 
a health care reform program covering all Americans. 
  Speaking to the business roundtable, an influential group of 
U.S. business executives, the U.S. president complained that 
Washington is "too partisan, too negative, too obsessed with 
process and conflict." 
  The atmosphere still has been more hostile to change than he 
had imagined it would be, Clinton said, adding that the American 
people desperately wanted change, but U.S. Congress and business 
are often unwilling to listen to them. 
  Seventeen months in office, Clinton said that he was still 
surprised by the opposition he has faced. 
  The business roundtable has endorsed a less ambitious health 
care reform plan than the one Clinton has suggested. The 
President's version is now stuck in U.S. Congress. 
  Facing predictions that Congress won't be able to enact 
universal coverage this year, Clinton said, "I refuse to declare 
defeat... let us not walk away." 
  Just before Clinton spoke, another Democrat on the pivotal 
Senate Finance Committee, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, backed 
away from the employer-mandate that is a central ingredient of 
the President's plan and floated a proposal to substitute an 
individual mandate instead. 
  Senate majority leader George Mitchell told the committee it 
would be mid-July before a bill could come to the floor. 
  The U.S. president used his speech to the business 
roundtable 
to seek support also for his proposals to overhaul the welfare 
system, job-training programs and to win passage of major trade 
legislation.

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- An international 
commercial arbitration conference opened here today. 
  At the conference over 250 experts and scholars in the 
fields 
of economy and trade, arbitration and the legal profession from 
30 countries will discuss the latest developments in 
international arbitration, arbitration legislation and practice. 
  It is the first time that such conference has ever been held 
in a developing country. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing sent a letter of 
congratulations to the conference, which is co-sponsored by the 
International Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) and the 
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee 
(CIETAC). 
  Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade and chairman of the CIETAC, 
said at the opening ceremony that China has solved many 
international commercial conflicts through arbitration in the 
past 40 years, and its arbitration system has steadily improved. 
  China has become one of the major centers for international 
commercial arbitration, he said. 
  Zheng said that China will spare no efforts to make its 
economic laws come closer to international standards, especially 
those of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Not long ago, he noted, China adopted a foreign trade law, 
and laws of arbitration and commerce are now under discussion. 
  Earlier today, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with the foreign 
delegates attending the conference. 
  He said during the meeting that the Chinese Government 
always 
supports not only the development of arbitration in China, but 
also exchanges and co-operation between Chinese and 
international arbitration circles. 
  Since China adopted the open policy in the late 1970s 
arbitration has played and will continue to play an important 
role in supporting the constant development of China's economy, 
Li said. 
  It is learned that so far China has included arbitration 
regulations in 14 laws, 82 administrative regulations and 190 
local laws.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Mutual respect for 
sovereignty and mutual benefit are of even more prominent 
significance in this post-Cold War era, when economic factors 
are playing a greater role in the international arena. 
  This is the message of a signed article by the China Center 
for International Studies carried in today's PEOPLE'S DAILY in 
commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the proclamation of the 
five principles. 
  It stresses that the five principles are still indispensable 
in preserving world peace and promoting development in the 
current multipolarized world, both politically and economically. 
  The five principles, namely mutual respect for territorial 
integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and 
mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, were jointly initiated 
by China, India and Myanmar [Burma] in late June 1954. 
  The world of today, featured by the dismembering of the 
former Soviet Union and the relatively weakening of the United 
States, provides an excellent opportunity and extensive base for 
the implementation of the five principles, the article says. In 
this aspect, the imposing of ideology by any one country on 
another to the neglect of the sovereignty of independent states 
can no longer work, the article notes. 
  The developed countries should provide more preferential 
conditions for the developing countries in the forms of economic 
aid, technical transfer and trade while thoroughly abandoning 
the practice of attaching political conditions while doing so. 
Thus, the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and 
territorial integrity and equality and mutual benefit are of 
conspicuous significance nowadays, the article says. 
  Despite the end of the Cold War, the conflicts centering on 
sovereignty have become even more prominent, as the western 
countries are still trying to infringe on the sovereignty of the 
Third World countries and interfere in their internal affairs by 
advocating "human rights ahead of sovereignty" and "sovereignty 
is outmoded". The fact is that while chanting "sovereignty is 
out of date", some developed countries never bother to limit 
their own sovereignty, but rather to set barriers to other 
countries' efforts to protect their sovereignty. 
  Only by upholding the five principles, the principle of 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs in particular, 
can the third world countries maintain their independence and 
develop their economies. 
  The five principles have so far been well accepted by the 
world as the fundamental standards in handling not only 
bilateral but also multilateral relations among countries, the 
article says. 
  In conclusion, the article says that in the present 
transition period from the old world pattern to a new one, 
adherence to the five principles will help solve the issues 
facing the world and establish a fair and reasonable new 
international order.

  [Text] Teheran, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Britain has installed 
sophisticated devices in the grounds of its embassy in Teheran 
to eavesdrop on sensitive Iranian departments including 
intelligence and foreign ministries, the weekly magazine KAYHAN 
HAVAI [name as received] reported. 
  The weekly, which is coming off here Wednesday [21 June], 
said that the devices have been brought into Iran in "diplomatic 
pouches" over the past few months. 
  The shipment of the listening devices had been decided upon 
months before the British intelligence service planted bugging 
devices in the Iranian Embassy in London, it added. 
  The official report said that the devices have enabled the 
British intelligence service to listen in on sensitive Iranian 
departments including ministries. The main targets are the 
intelligence, foreign and interior ministries. 
  A group of Iranian students studying electronics in British 
Universities were quoted by the weekly magazine as saying that 
the British Telecommunications had confirmed the shipment but 
had not elaborated. 
  The students have called on the Iranian Government to take 
adequate legal measures and order the British to remove the 
devices from their embassy. 
  With regard to the recent exposure of bugging devices 
planted 
by British intelligence in the Iranian Embassy in London, the 
students criticized the Iranian Government for failing to employ 
Iranians to repair damage to the embassy building. 
  The weekly quoted the students as saying that "British 
workers had helped British intelligence to plant the bugging 
devices while repairing the embassy." 
  The recent hostile actions between the two sides have 
undermined the already fragile relations between Teheran and 
London. The political row between the two countries has led to 
the expulsion of one diplomat from each side.

<F P=106> [Report: "Hong Kong XINHUA Deputy Director Zheng Guoxiong </F>
Urges Britain to Give Up Confrontation, Effect a Fundamental 
Change in Policy"] 
  [Text] Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of Hong Kong branch 
of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, talked about recent Sino-British ties 
at an open occasion yesterday. He said that the key to 
improvement in Sino-British ties lies in Britain's attitude and 
action. Zheng urged the British side to give up its policy of 
confrontation with China and effect a fundamental change in its 
policy. 
  The Association of New Territories Mass Organizations held a 
gathering yesterday to mark the ninth anniversary of its 
founding and to congratulate its members being elected as 
deputies of National People's Congress, members of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and the 
Preliminary Working Committee, Hong Kong affairs advisers, 
deputies to the Guangdong People's Congress, members of the 
Guangdong CPPCC, and Hong Kong district affairs advisers. In 
response to a question by a reporter at the gathering, Zheng 
Guoxiong said that everybody is concerned about recent 
Sino-British relations. While meeting with state leaders in 
Beijing, the same question was raised by members of delegations 
from the Hong Kong Federation of Industry and the Hong Kong 
Chinese Chamber of Commerce. 
  In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng 
said, China and Britain should cooperate in resolving major 
issues related to Hong Kong's transition because this will 
benefit Hong Kong's smooth transition. This is also the 
consistent stand and position of the Chinese Government. 
  The British Government had changed its policy toward China 
at 
the previous stage, made a mistaken evaluation of the situation, 
and pursued a policy of confrontation with China, which produced 
a negative impact on Sino-British cooperation, Zheng stated. 
  Now the key to resumption of Sino-British cooperation lies 
in 
Britain's attitude and action, Zheng continued, and the Chinese 
Government hopes that the British side will give up its policy 
of confrontation and will effect a fundamental change in its 
policy. Zheng stressed that because of the unilateral action 
taken by Patten, it has been impossible for China and Britain to 
cooperate in the political system. Proceeding from the 
fundamental and long-term interests of the Hong Kong residents 
and for the sake of maintaining Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity, however, the Chinese Government still hopes to 
cooperate with the British side in terms of economy, people's 
livelihood, and other fields. This is also the consistent 
spirit of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong. 
  The Hong Kong government's proposal to increase openness in 
information access involved a major change in government 
operations and did not conform with the relevant spirit of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, Zheng Guoxiong stated. As the 
British Hong Kong government did not consult the Chinese side in 
advance, it is unacceptable to the Chinese side. 
  Zheng also refuted the so-called statement that this was 
Hong 
Kong's internal affair. He said that the move involved the 
transition to 1997 and exerted an influence on current, as well 
as future operations. Therefore, the Chinese side must be 
consulted. Otherwise, the Chinese Government will not undertake 
any responsibility. Neither will the future government of the 
special administrative region undertake any responsibility.

<F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China has dismissed diplomatic concerns that it 
might plant spies and informers in foreign consulates in Hong 
Kong after 1997. 
  Diplomatic missions in the territory fear a Foreign 
Ministry-run government agency might centralise their supply of 
local staff when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
  Under the Basic Law, the Central People's Government will be 
responsible for foreign affairs in the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR). 
  But China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The HONGKONG 
STANDARD it had no intention of changing current consulate 
practices which allow foreign diplomatic missions in the 
territory absolute freedom to recruit their own staff. 
  In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said all 
consulate-related matters would be further examined, but that 
basically China was unwilling to change the territory's usual 
practices. 
  "After China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty 
over 
Hong Kong, the present system will basically remain unchanged," 
the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Staff such as office clerks, interpreters, drivers or 
domestic helpers at diplomats' residences are usually recruited 
through public advertisements in local newspapers. 
  Sources argued the practice of planting bugs and spies in 
foreign diplomatic missions was not only used by communist 
countries but also by many Western nations. 
  "Under the present staff recruitment rules, spies and 
informers can still mingle in foreign consulates in Hong Kong," 
a source said. 
  The question of whether new recruitment rules will be 
introduced for the territory's foreign consulates is a very 
"minor issue to China. 
  "A principle has been stipulated under the Basic Law on the 
questions concerning the establishment of foreign consulates in 
Hong Kong," the Foreign Ministry statement said. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofeng explained that 
foreign affairs issues in Hong Kong would be handled by China 
under the Basic Law provisions which referred to major 
diplomatic policy. 
  "The Foreign Ministry will not take care of those small 
concrete things," Mr Shen said, referring to staff recruitment 
for foreign diplomatic missions in Hong Kong. 
  "The local staff recruitment rules for consulates are among 
considerable number of matter that have not yet been fully 
studied by the Foreign Ministry."

  [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Defense and 
Public Security Experts subgroup of the Sino-British Joint 
Liaison Group ended its 16th meeting in Hong Kong yesterday. 
The parties did not reach a consensus in all aspects on the 
transfer of military-use land in Hong Kong, but made progress on 
some issues. Both parties agreed to hold an informal meeting in 
the next few days to continue their consultations. 
  In his interview with reporters after the meeting, Chen 
Zuoer, head of the Chinese delegation, said: During these four 
days, both parties have further narrowed their discrepancies and 
made some progress. But there are some issues which need 
further discussions. The Chinese side will try its best to 
continue to seek a resolution to some pending problems in an 
informal and flexible manner so as to reach an agreement at the 
earliest possible date.

  [Text] China is to significantly boost the staff of its key 
policy branch on Hong Kong affairs in the next two months to 
help speed up preparations for the 1997 handover. 
  About 16 newly-recruited staff will join the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office in the face of the increasing workload on 
transitional matters. 
  The extra staff will mainly work under the two major 
departments on political and economic affairs, headed by Xu Ze 
and Zhang Liangdong. At present, each department has about 20 
staff who help formulate China's strategy on matters ranging 
from the airport plan, localisation of civil service and Joint 
Liaison Group issues. 
  The extra staff have been recruited in the past few months 
following a decision by the Chinese Government to increase 
staffing of the office in view of the growing workload. Sources 
said the new recruits were all fresh graduates from major 
universities in Beijing. 
  "Of course, it's most ideal to have people who have already 
had some experience on Hong Kong affairs transferred from other 
departments. But the pool of experienced staff is really too 
small. We can only look for fresh university graduates," an 
official said. 
  The official said the extra staff would have to be given 
training on the background to the Hong Kong issues. 
  He said the additional staff would help strengthen the 
research team of the two departments and the sup porting team 
for the Preliminary Working Committee. 
  Officials said the staff in crease was imperative because 
workloads had risen in the lead-up to 1997.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Should Compensations Be Made If the </F>
Employment Contract Is Not Renewed After Expiration?"] 
  [Text] Recently, the secretary for civil service affairs of 
the Hong Kong Government announced that he had explained to 
administrative officers employed according to overseas contracts 
that all expatriate employees in the policy-making branches of 
the Government Secretariat will have to retire by the age of 57; 
at the same time, the Government will promote local 
administrative officers to various secretary posts ahead of 
their previous expatriate superiors. After the secretary for 
civil service affairs made the announcement, the overseas civil 
servants revealed more inside stories. It was said that the 
Hong Kong Government had promised to pay compensation to A- and 
B-class expatriate officials in the policy-making branches who 
could not be promoted. As the expatriate officials in the 
policy-making branches will be forced to retire ahead of the 
retirement age or will not be promoted, they will bring a suit 
against the Government, which has harmed their "human rights." 
  The suit brought by the overseas civil servants against the 
Hong Kong Government was based on the "Human Rights Act" 
formulated by the Hong Kong Government. They held that taking 
legal action against the government on the basis of the new act 
certainly would drive the Government into an awkward predicament 
in the proceedings. Such handling of the personnel arrangements 
for secretary-level officials by the Hong Kong Government 
obviously was a deliberate ploy to leave some loopholes so that 
excuses could be found to make compensation before its power 
comes to an end. 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the 
administration of the British Hong Kong Government will come to 
an end on 30 June 1997; and the Basic Law stipulates that the 
secretary-level officials will be Chinese citizens who are 
permanent residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, the British Hong 
Kong Government cannot sign any employment contracts with 
expatriate civil servants which extend beyond 1997. Moreover, 
the Hong Kong Government has long announced its civil service 
localization policy. When Edward Youde and David Wilson were 
governors, local Chinese officials were promoted to be branch 
secretaries and department directors. This fact never aroused 
any controversy. However, after Chris Patten took the 
governorship in 1992, the Hong Kong Government took such 
measures as the naturalization of expatriate civil servants and 
the adoption of the Human Rights Act, and this thus led to the 
troublesome legal proceedings taken by the expatriate civil 
servants against the government. 
  Why did the expatriate officials at the posts of branch 
secretary and department director obediently retire without 
taking legal proceedings before Patten took the governorship? 
There were two reasons. First, according to the Letters Patent 
and the Royal Instructions, all officials must obey the 
governor, and the governor does not need to give any explanation 
when deciding to promote or not to promote any official, or to 
require any official to retire. Second, all expatriate civil 
servants signed employment contracts that did not extend beyond 
1997, and the contracts were normally two-year or four-year 
ones. Moreover, the Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions 
were constitutional documents, which naturally took precedence 
over any local legislation. 
  According to newspaper reports in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong 
Government and the secretary-level expatriate officials have 
reached a secret agreement, and the government will pay HK$2.9 
million in compensation to them. The local public was not 
consulted before this arrangement was made, and the Legislative 
Council was not briefed. After this is made a fait accompli, 
Hong Kong taxpayers will be forced to pay the bill without an 
opportunity to say no. 
  According to usual practice, if the employment contract of 
an 
expatriate civil servant is not to be renewed, the government 
will give notice 10 months ahead of its expiration. Once the 
contract expires, the expatriate civil servant will have to 
leave office, and the government will not have to pay any 
compensation. In the current cases, however, some expatriate 
officials received the relevant notices 18 months ahead of the 
expiration of their employment contracts, and they had 
sufficient time to seek new jobs in private institutions. How 
could they be paid special compensation, or bring a suit in 
court? Will the expatriate civil servants whose employment 
contracts were not renewed before Patten took office also take 
similar legal proceedings so as to claim compensation? If no 
compensation is paid to the latter, how will the Hong Kong 
Government justify its double standard? 
  In the Common Law areas, the expiration of the employment 
contracts indicates the termination of the employment 
relationship between the employer and the employee, and there 
exists no issue of compensation. Now the Hong Kong Government 
is showing its "generosity" by bestowing the Hong Kong people's 
money in violation of legal principles and standard practice, 
and without regard for the interests of Hong Kong people. 
  The present state of affairs shows that the "Human Rights 
Act" is a carefully calculated plan of the British Hong Kong 
authorities ahead of their withdrawal. On the surface, the act 
was aimed at guaranteeing Hong Kong people's human rights; in 
reality, it served some different purposes. According to the 
"Human Rights Act," those who try to evade taxes or dodge their 
creditors may flee Hong Kong without being held up by the court 
and without being detained. What a disorderly situation will 
this cause! 
  From the Hong Kong Government's plan for the naturalization 
of the expatriate civil servants to the arrangement for huge 
amounts of compensation for expatriate civil servants who leave 
office after the expiration of their employment contracts -- all 
these facts show how the colonial rulers are using public office 
for private gain. The Hong Kong people now are worried that the 
expatriate officials in the Mass Transit Rail Corporation, the 
Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, and the Provisional Airport 
Authority will follow the example of the expatriate government 
officials in taking away a huge amount of compensation before 
1997.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Social and Security 
Special Group under the Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region held its fifth meeting at the Hong Kong-Macao Center in 
Beijing from 17 to 18 June. The participants discussed the 
issue of reflux immigration among Hong Kong permanent residents 
who are Chinese citizens. 
  The committee members noted: Chinese citizens among Hong 
Kong's permanent residents who obtain foreign nationality status 
following their emigration before 1997 are no longer Chinese 
citizens. Therefore, they will not be accorded the permanent 
residence status according to the provisions contained in items 
1 and 2, paragraph 2, Article 24 of the Basic Law, but they may 
obtain permanent residence status in accordance with item 4 
under paragraph 2 of Article 24 provided they meet the three 
requirements set in the item. However, in studying this issue, 
it is necessary to take into consideration that the Basic Law 
takes effect on 1 July 1997 and that objective and subjective 
laws stipulating Hong Kong as the place of permanent residence 
will not be enacted until after 1997. This is, in fact, a 
question of transition. Therefore, the British Hong Kong 
Government is urged to revise its "Regulations on the Entry of 
People" as soon as possible in order to make its prescribed 
requirements for permanent residents in complete accord with the 
provisions of the Basic Law.

  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- China's total of 
exchange lines will reach 140 million by the end of this 
century, becoming one of the world's largest telecommunications 
networks, said Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of posts and 
telecommunications, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA here 
today. 
  He said that by the year 2000, the country will have all the 
telecommunications techniques that exist in the world, and be 
able to provide all the telecommunications services available 
elsewhere in the world. 
  The modern telecommunications infrastructure, aiming to 
provide an information super-highway for the national economy, 
will have a considerable scale, he said. 
  The minister said that compared with Western countries, 
China 
is spared the pain of eliminating out-dated equipment, due to 
its not- so-developed telecommunications infrastructure. As a 
result, China's telecommunications construction can leap over 
some development stages and technical levels which the Western 
countries had gone through, and directly adopt highly efficient 
new technology and equipment. 
  He said that the foreign technology introduced must be of 
advanced level and suited to China's needs, [in] trying to 
develop China's own electronic telecommunications industry with 
the help of introduced technology. 
  In the construction of optical cables, China is aiming at 
the 
world's most advanced technology, Wu said, adding that the 
world's most advanced optical cable network will be constructed 
along the Tianjin-Shenyang-Dalian line. 
  He said that all the capital cities in China, except Lhasa, 
will be connected by optical cables by June 1995. City and 
county telecommunication bureaus will also enter the national 
network. 
  Some 17 more major optical cables, to add to the present 22, 
will be constructed by the year 2000 to intensify the 
telecommunications coverage and take Lhasa and other cities in 
Tibet into the network, Wu said. 
  China is adopting the automatic exchange switch system 
directly, overleaping several stages of technological 
development in other parts of the world, he said, adding that 
some 89 percent of the exchange switches for urban 
telecommunication systems in the country and 99 percent for long 
distance calls are computerized. 
  The number of exchange switches increased by 12 million to 
42 
million last year, which is unprecedented in any other county, 
according to Wu. 
  China will keep up the annual increase of 10 million 
automatic exchange switches till the end of the century, 
building the largest and most advanced telecommunication 
networks in the world, he added. 
  Wu said the Chinese Government is paying increasing 
attention 
to the projects on national public information networks, 
electronic currency and foreign trade and economic information 
networks in order to meet the demand of China's economic 
development and its entry into the world market. 
  He said that this would inevitably stimulate the growth of 
the telecommunications infrastructure. 
  Wu said his ministry will continue the exchanges and 
cooperation with foreign telecommunications giants in an effort 
to import state- of-the-art technology, like high-speed optical 
telecommunications system, digital mobile telecommunications and 
network control system.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Xinhua Nationwide 
Paging Network -- a radio paging network covering more than 70 
large and medium-sized cities across China -- was inaugurated in 
Beijing on 18 June. 
  It is the first nationwide radio paging cooperative 
organization in China, as well as a network with the most users 
and the widest area of information service coverage. A would-be 
user may apply for the service in his or her city, and may 
obtain a "nationwide paging service card." Along with the card, 
he or she will be given a beeper at any of the cities covered by 
the network. Each user has a "nationwide paging number" and can 
be reached at any of those cities. It takes two calls at most 
to reach a user.

JIEFANGJUN BAO reporter Su Ruozhou (5685 5387 5297)] 
  [Text] Jinan, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- In the company of Chief of 
General Staff Zhang Wannian, Liu Huaqing, Standing Committee 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected troops 
stationed in Henan and Shandong from 13 through 18 June. He 
stressed that the entire army should value and attach the utmost 
importance to the fresh upsurge in troop training that has 
already emerged, further strengthen and reform military 
training, and upgrade the troops' combat capability under 
high-technology conditions to strive for the fulfillment of 
Chairman Jiang Zemin's overall demand that "the army must be 
qualified politically and competent militarily, have a fine 
style of work, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of 
adequate logistical support." 
  After hearing a report on the state of troop training 
reform, 
Liu Huaqing on 13 June said in western Henan: Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the need to give military 
training a place in strategy, while Comrade Jiang Zemin demands 
that army units pay close, proper attention to military training 
as a regular central task. In recent years I have always 
thought about the question: In what way can our troops complete 
the shift from dealing with warfare under ordinary conditions to 
winning a localized war under high-technology conditions? 
Thanks to the deepening of training reform, some successful 
ways have been found through our explorations, and a fresh 
upsurge in troop training has basically taken shape throughout 
the armed forces. 
  That evening, the Army and the Air Force held a nighttime 
joint exercise at a hilly area. Liu Huaqing rushed to the 
exercise ground and told the military unit leaders on hand: In 
making nighttime warfare drill and troop training under 
high-technology conditions the theme of nighttime training 
reform, you have selected a good spot for a breakthrough. 
Mobilizing the entire military in nighttime training reform is 
a historical development. Now that the correct way has been 
found, it is necessary to popularize, develop, and upgrade it, 
and pay attention to its implementation in a solid and 
down-to-earth manner. 
  Braving the high temperature of 36 degrees centigrade, Liu 
Huaqing went to a certain tank regiment to view an exhibition of 
night vision devices. When he saw the good effects of the 
automated system for daytime and nighttime command of artillery 
troops [pao bing qun zhou ye zhi hui zi dong hua xi tong 3517 
0365 5028 2521 1123 2172 2264 5261 0520 0553 4762 4827], Liu 
Huaqing cheerfully said: To pursue modernization with the 
present equipment, our army should take the path of 
technological innovation, tap the potential of existing 
equipment, and upgrade combat efficiency to twice the current 
level. The key lies in emancipating the mind, firming up our 
will, and giving play to the subjective initiative and 
creativity. So long as we make our way into this area and make 
more explorations, we will be able to find the way through which 
the inferior can prevail over the superior [yi lie sheng you 
0110 0503 0524 0327]. 
  Liu Huaqing visited grass-roots cadres and soldiers 
everywhere he went. After a certain air division carried out a 
nighttime joint exercise with the Army, he specifically called 
the pilots to his side and said in sincere words and with 
earnest wishes: You have put on a really excellent performance. 
Fighting might take place not only during daytime but also at 
night, or even alternately during daytime and nighttime. We 
must prepare for both; we should carry out rigorous training 
during daytime as well as nighttime. 
  During his investigation and study of the troops, Liu 
Huaqing 
repeatedly stressed in front of high-ranking military cadres: 
The current state of troop training is very good; leading 
cadres at all levels should take the lead in stepping up the 
study of high technology know-how, studying high-technology 
warfare, carrying forward the fine tradition of our army, and 
carrying out reform and innovation. Should we keep paying 
unremitting attention in this way, we surely will be able to 
lift our army's combat capability under high-technology 
conditions to a new level, and to justify the great trust placed 
in us by the party and the people.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- An all-Army forum on 
consolidating and reforming productive and management activities 
was held in Beijing 13-17 June. Zhang Zhen, Central Military 
Commission [CMC] vice chairman, addressed the forum, stressing 
the need to follow the instructions of CMC chaiman Jiang Zemin, 
as well as other relevant CMC instructions and decisions in 
bringing into play the Army's fine traditions of serving the 
people wholeheartedly and of consciously subordinating itself to 
the overall interests, and in further promoting healthy 
development of the Army's productive and management activities. 
Fu Quanyou, CMC member and director of the General Logistics 
Department, attended and spoke at the forum. CMC members Chi 
Haotian and Yu Yongbo attended the meeting. 
  According to a briefing, the Army has scored notable results 
in consolidating and reforming productive and management 
activities: In the light of realities, all major units have 
formulated concrete plans to actively and steadily implement the 
CMC's guidelines on centralized management of enterprises; the 
CMC's regulation banning combat troops from engaging in 
productive and management activities has been gradually 
enforced; Army-run coal mines in Shanxi have been transferred to 
local authorities to the satisfaction of the state, the Army, 
the local governments, and the masses of people; and all units 
have persisted in promoting consolidation and reform on the one 
hand, while stabilizing and developing production to avoid 
drastic decreases in production efficiency on the other, thereby 
giving a strong impetus to agricultural and sideline production 
in all Army units. 
  In his speech, Zhang Zhen said: Consolidating and reforming 
the Army's productive and management activities is a major 
policy decision made by CMC in accordance with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's concept of Army building in the new period. Chairman 
Jiang Zemin made a series of important instructions regarding 
the work. We must earnestly understand and unify our thinking, 
based on the spirit of important instructions and the policy 
decision, so as to more consciously and steadfastly implement 
the CMC policy decision. 
  He emphasized: As the consolidation and reform of productive 
and management activities involves major readjustments in 
interest relationships, we must emphasize, in particular, the 
sense of discipline. We should strengthen supervision and 
inspection by bringing into play the role of discipline 
inspection and auditing departments. He pointed out: To 
successfully consolidate and reform productive and management 
activities is a real test of high-level leading organs; it is 
also an important aspect of the task of improving office and 
leadership work style. In the next phase of consolidation and 
reform work, the headquarters and all major units should pay 
close attention to the consolidation and reform of their 
productive and management activities, assigning principal 
leaders to personally take charge of the work to ensure 
consolidation and reform in each and every department. Office 
and department leaders must take overall interests into account 
and ensure the completion of consolidation and reform work 
quantitatively and qualitatively. 
  In his speech, Fu Quanyou summarized the consolidation and 
reform work in the productive and management activities of all 
Army units in the early phase, and set forth specific tasks for 
the next phase. He said: In the next phase, we should focus 
attention on work in the following five areas: 1) conducting an 
immediate inventory of the "dismantling, screening, suspending, 
and standardizing" productive and management activities of Army 
units stationed in some localities; 2) earnestly ensuring 
readjustment of the organizational structure of all Army-run 
enterprises; 3) further screening and consolidating productive 
and management projects and setting a deadline by which all 
those violating the regulation must correct themselves; 4) 
striving to fulfill this year's productive tasks; and 5) 
strictly conducting inspections and acceptance tests. 
  Leaders of the three general departments and responsible 
comrades of all major units and the Army police headquarters 
attended the forum.

  [Text] Jinan, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- To our great sorrow, 
Comrade Dong Xuelin, former deputy commander of the Jinan 
Military Region, passed away at the age of 63 due to a serious 
neurocranium injury sustained from a fall at his home on 20 
April. 
  Dong Xuelin came from Laiwu County, Shandong Province. He 
joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1948 and the CPC 
in 1949. During the Liberation War, he served first as a soldier

for the motherland and the party's cause; took care to preserve 
the interests of the whole; fought bravely in war; worked 
enthusiastically, cautiously, and conscientiously; adopted an 
earnest and responsible attitude; united his comrades; did his 
job in a thoroughgoing and creative manner; and accumulated 
extensive military experience and showed his capability to 
organize and lead. He supported the party's line and general 
and specific policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, kept in step with the party Central 
Committee politically, and made due contributions to 
strengthening army building.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The exhibitions and 
demonstrations of exchange, carrier wave, microwave, satellite, 
optic fiber, and computer networks and software developed by a 
telecommunications research institute under the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA] General Staff Headquarters today indicated 
a historic leap into a regularized, serialized, and programed 
new stage for the PLA's telecommunications and command 
automation programs. 
  As a leading PLA scientific research institute specializing 
in telecommunications and command automation programs, this 
institute has scored great successes following three decades of 
hard work in tackling key problems. Of over 2,000 scientific 
research projects it completed, 200 were winners of state, 
army-level Scientific and Technological Achievement Awards, 
including State Scientific and Technological Advancement Awards 
and Invention Awards for eight projects. The development and 
application of these scientific research achievements has helped 
the PLA upgrade its telecommunications equipment from electronic 
tubes and transistors to large-scale integrated circuits, 
resulting in the substantial enhancement of its overall 
telecommunications level. As far as the PLA's command 
automation programs are concerned, the completed process from 
single machine development to a remote on-line and armywide 
network has provided the PLA with a modern security device in 
terms of operation command, military training, force management, 
and information processing. 
  The promotion of the PLA's telecommunications and command 
automation programs also effectively supports state economic 
construction, bringing impressive social and economic benefits. 
In recent years, the application of 218 scientific and 
technological achievements in state economic development has won 
high praise from both local governments and the masses.

on the rescue work at the Dachang section of the Bei Jiang dike. 
On 18 June the flood waters ran high and swelled perilously at 
the Dachang section. If the precarious situation had not been 
handled promptly, the dike could have collapsed. Once the 
perilous swelling occurred, Army personnel and local civilians 
rushed to rescue the dike and in the end averted the potential 
disaster. 
  Qian Qichen conveyed the regards of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council to the hundreds of officers and 
men who were carrying out relief tasks at the Bei Jiang dike, 
highly appraised their performances in fighting floods and doing 
relief work, and urged them to make persistent efforts, heighten 
their vigilance, and strive for overall victories in the 
struggle against the flooding at the Bei Jiang dike.

<F P=106> [Report: "State Council's Work Group Arrives in Guangdong </F>
To Guide Anti-Flood Work Along the Bei Jiang"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 20 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- The joint work 
group sent by the State Council and led by Hou Jie, minister of 
construction, and He Jing, vice minister of water resources, 
arrived in Guangzhou yesterday. They went to the areas that are 
heavily guarded against the flood -- the Zhaoqing area along the 
Xi Jiang and the large dam on the Bei Jiang, to give guidance 
and make arrangements for the work to combat the floods and deal 
with emergencies. The group feels that, so far, the work of 
preventing floods and providing relief to disaster-hit areas has 
been successful in Guangdong. 
  The group inspected the condition of the disaster in the 
flood-prevention areas of Yunan County and Fengkai County along 
the Xi Jiang in Zhaoqing and called for the local government to 
try every possible means to help more than 50,000 people 
besieged by the floods get through their difficulties. 
  The group praised the people in Daqiaowei, Deqing County, 
for 
their meritorious deeds in combating the floods, as more than 
10,000 local cadres and masses struggled for three days and 
nights to build an embankment of sand bags one meter high and 
seven km long to rein in the flood water overflow and secure the 
lives and properties of some 100,000 people in five townships 
and towns. The group also carefully inspected Fengle County in 
Dinghu District of Zhaoqing, which is a "difficult place to 
fortify against the flood." 
  Yesterday, the group hurriedly left Zhaoqing for Lubao Town, 
the front-line flood control command post of the Bei Jiang Dam, 
to inspect the three dangerous sections in Xialingzhou.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Several million local 
people and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are 
fighting the floods that have been hitting the provinces of 
Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi, and the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous 
region in southern China since mid-June. 
  On the evening of June 19, a flood peak of the Beijiang 
River, the highest water level in the past 50 years, struck the 
Shijiao- Xialingzhou section of the dyke, causing seepage along 
a three to four-km section. 
  At the critical moment, several thousand local people and 
PLA 
soldiers rushed to the site with sand-bags and other material to 
reinforce the dyke. By 4:00 in the early morning of June 20, 
the flood peak passed the Sanshui hydrometric station safely and 
Guangzhou city and the Pearl River Delta survived. 
  In Duan, Luocheng and two other cities of Guangxi, which 
were 
most seriously hit by the floods, the regional governor, Cheng 
Kejie, went to the flood-stricken counties to make arrangements 
for air-dropping relief supplies to over 6,000 people besieged 
by the waters. 
  Hunan provincial leaders also went to the flood-hit area and 
led about two million local people to fight the flood together 
with 3,000 PLA soldiers. The flood peak of the Xiangjiang River 
has now passed Changsha city, capital of Hunan Province. 
  But some of Changsha's urban and suburban areas are still 
immersed in water. 
  In Jiangxi Province, more than three million local people 
and 
120,000 PLA soldiers have spared no efforts to fight the floods. 
So far, over two million straw bags, 137,000 cubic meters of 
sand and aggregate, 292 lifeboats and 1,461 automobiles have 
been used in the battle against the floods. 
  According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters, the water levels of the four major flood rivers -- 
the Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang -- have all 
started to drop slowly, but are still above their warning levels. 
  Since the flood peaks of the Xijiang and Beijiang will 
affect 
the Pearl River Delta simultaneously, the delta, one of China's 
most economically developed areas, is still facing heavy 
pressure from the floods. 
  Some PLA soldiers have been transferred from Guangxi to 
Guangdong to help the people there to fight the floods.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State 
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest 
or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China 
occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, 
and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping 
slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers 
for the next few days. Due to interaction of the Bei Jiang and 
Xi Jiang, the Zhujiang Delta will face a high water-level test. 
  Heavy rainfall over a wide area since mid-June resulted in 
the largest flood waters since liberation of the country in the 
Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Xiang Jiang rivers. The flood water in 
Guangdong's Xi Jiang crested in Gaoyao County on 20 June; the 
water level in Gaoyao's Xi Jiang dropped to 13.37 meters at 0600 
today. A flood peak occured in Bei Jiang in Guangdong's Sanshui 
at 0400 on 20 June, raising the water level to 10.39 meters -- 
the largest flood level ever recorded. The water level droppped 
to 10.16 meters at 0600 today. 
  Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang 
do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situations have eased, 
because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain 
at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea 
after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying 
Zhujiang Delta. In particular, the sea tide may add to the 
flood waters on 25 June. With these factors combined, the 
Zhujiang Delta, which has a developed economy and a forest of 
factories, will face the most rigorous flood water test since 
the liberation of the country. 
  The situation in the Xiang Jiang is also not an easy one. 
The flood peak passed Changsha on 19 June, but the water level 
at the Changsha Station was still at 25 meters at 0200 today 
[1800 GMT 20 June]. Because the water level has remained high 
for a long period, several dangerous situations have occured 
along the river's dikes. Dike reinforcing work needs to be 
stepped up. 
  The flood peak in Gan Jiang entered Boyang Lake on 20 June. 
However, due to continued rains over the last few days, the 
water level in the upper reaches west of Ganzhou has begun to 
rise again. At 0800 today, the water level at the Ganzhou 
Station was 100.95 meters, 3.45 meters above the warning level.

7,791 have been injured. 
  In southern Guangdong, 174 people dead are dead, 3,094 
injured and 65 missing, the statement said, although local

<F P=106> [By Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601 ): "Liu Nianchun and </F>
Zhang Ling From the League for Guaranteeing Laborers' Rights 
Disappear One After Another"] 
  [Text] Liu Nianchun, instigator of the "League for 
Guaranteeing Laborers' Rights" [LGLR] in Mainland China and 
convener of the Peace Charter, has disappeared from Jiangsu 
since 28 May. His brother Liu Qing, who is chairman of "China 
Human Rights" in New York, is 99 percent sure he has been 
arrested by the mainland authorities. Zhang Ling, another 
member of the LGLR in Anhui, has also been taken away by 
security personnel. Liu Qing is worried that a new round of 
dissident arrests has started in Beijing. 
  On 9 March this year, Liu Nianchun, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang 
Zhongqiu officially applied to the authorities for the 
establishment of the LGLR. The application was handed in by Liu 
Nianchun to the Ministry of Civil Administration. As this was a 
pioneering undertaking on the mainland, indicating that the 
mainland's democracy movement had become more open, organized, 
and legalized, it attracted attention from the international 
media. The organization has a preparatory committee with more 
than 120 members nationwide, but because of their worries about 
large-scale arrests by the mainland authorities, their names 
have not been made public for the time being. Instead, Liu 
Nianchun and the other two shouldered the responsibility and 
appeared in public. 
  Of the three men, Yuan Hongbin, a lecturer in the Law 
Faculty 
of Beijing University, was first arrested by the mainland 
authorities on 2 April. Another organizer, Wang Zhongqiu, was 
also arrested on 1 June. Wang Jiaqi, a postgraduate at the Law 
Faculty of Beijing University and another key member of the LGLR 
who was arrested together with Yuan Hongbin, escaped while being 
escorted from Beijing to Hebei's Tangshan Prison. With the 
assistance of underground pro-democracy organizations, he 
successfully arrived in Hong Kong on 15 April, gained U.S. 
political asylum, and went to New York via London. 
  Liu Qing pointed out that Liu Nianchun had actually intended 
to leave for Jiangsu and lie low on the eve of the 4 June 
incident. His wife, who is in Beijing, last received a phone 
call from him on 26 May, and he said he would return to Beijing 
the following week. Liu Nianchun and one of his friends both 
disappeared on 28 May after they had a telephone conversation. 
Wang Zhongqiu also disappeared at the same time and his arrest 
was later confirmed.

  [Excerpts] Peng Peiyun, state councillor and minister of 
the State Family Planning Commission, concluded her sixth 
inspection tour of Fujian and left Fuzhou last evening. During 
her stay, she held extensive discussions with leaders of the 
departments concerned, listened to reports on Fujian's economic 
development plan, family planning, health, and women work, and 
affirmed the achievements scored in these fields. At the same 
time, she set new demands. 
  Peng Peiyun emphatically pointed out: Family planning work 
is an arduous and long-term task, which should be carried out in 
a conscientious, sustained, and down-to-earth way. We should 
continue to do a good job of rural health work, conduct better 
investigations and study, combine the "double learn from and 
double emulation" activities with the work of the grass-roots 
units, and turn the implementation of the outline of the program 
for the Chinese children of the 1990's into government behavior. 
She said: Fujian is one of the provinces that has done the 
work of the grass-roots units well. It has had a successful 
experience in stabilizing policies, laying a solid foundation 
for the work of the grass-roots units, and managing the floating 
population and the population of foreign-invested enterprises. 
[passage omitted] 
  Peng Peiyun urged combining the "double learn from and 
double 
emulation" activities with family planning work; combining 
production, livelihood, and child bearing; decreasing the number 
of births and [words indistinct]; and making family planning 
voluntary on the part of the women involved. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- China cracked more than 
4,900 narcotics-related criminal cases in the first quarter this 
year, seizing some 1,000 kilograms of heroin and 476 kilograms 
of opium. 
  This was revealed by Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of public 
security, here today at a working conference of the National 
Commission of Narcotics Control (NCNC). 
  "Narcotics-related crimes, especially transnational drug 
smuggling, were effectively curbed in the country as police and 
customs officers joined efforts to combat them," Bai told the 
conference. 
  China's anti-drug campaign has been centered on the Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, both bordering the 
"Golden Triangle" in Myanmar [Burma] which are ravaged the most 
by deadly crimes as smugglers choose to transport narcotics 
through these areas to other parts of the world. 
  The border provinces accounted for 82 percent of the heroin 
and 70 percent of the opium seized in the country in the first 
three months this year, said the vice-minister, who is also 
deputy director of the NCNC. 
  Bai said China's cooperation with the international 
community 
in its fight against drug crimes has been "effective." 
  The narcotics control program of China, Myanmar and the UN 
is 
"being carried out smoothly," he said, adding that China's 
cooperation with Thailand and Laos in this field has also been 
strengthened. 
  Meanwhile, Bai noted that China has also made remarkable 
achievements in drug rehabilitation programs. 
  "The rising trend of new addicts has been slowed and the 
country has begun to see an annual decrease in the new addict 
population," he said. 
  Some 50,000 of the country's drug addicts received training 
courses to quit drugs in 1993, he said. 
  Minister of Public Security and NCNC Director Tao Siju also 
told the conference that China will continue its cooperation 
with the international community, especially bordering 
countries, in combating drug-related crime. 
  "With rampant international narcotics crimes, China still 
faces a harsh challenge from traffickers and it will continue to 
intensify the crackdown on these crimes with cooperation from 
its customs, and organizations in other countries and regions, 
so as to reduce the impact of drug trafficking to the minimum," 
Tao said.

  [Text] Yantai, 14 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)-- DAZHONG 
RIBAO [POPULAR DAILY] reported today that the hearing of a 
copyright lawsuit in which Xiao Rong and the Central Party 
Literature Publishing House sued the Fenglai City Printing House 
was concluded a few days ago at the Yantai City Intermediate 
People's Court. 
  After hearing the case from both sides, the court found that 
plaintiff Xiao Rong owns the copyright for the book My 
Father, Deng Xiaoping and plaintiff Central Party 
Literature Publishing House possesses the book's sole publishing 
rights and the right to its format and graphic design. The 
court also found that their legal rights and interests should be 
protected by the law. Defendant Fenglai Printing House was 
found to have infringed on the copyright of the book in 
publishing it on the strength of a forged certification document 
provided by another person and ordered to pay part of the civil 
damages in accordance with the provisions of the "PRC Copyright 
Law." 
  Mediation at the court resulted in a reconciliation between 
the plaintiffs and the defendant. The Fenglai Printing House 
agreed to place an announcement in XINWEN CHUBAN BAO [NEWS 
PUBLISHING POST] apologizing to the Central Party Literature 
Publishing House and Xiao Rong. The announcement is to be made 
within a month after the reconciliation letter reaches the 
plaintiffs. The defendant will also pay the Central Party 
Literature Publishing House 30,000 yuan in compensation for 
profit losses and Xiao Rong 15,000 yuan for unpaid royalties.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Properly Handle the Work on </F>
Overseas Chinese Affairs--Warmly Congratulating the Triumphant 
Close of the Fifth National Conference of Returned Overseas 
Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese"] 
  [Text] Under the situation in which our country is 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, and expediting socialist 
modernization, the five-day Fifth National Conference of 
Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese has 
triumphantly ended. We warmly congratulate the success of the 
conference. 
  Over the past five years since the last conference, our 
country has experienced tremendous and profound changes in 
various areas -- it has seen political stability, economic 
development, national unity, and social progress. These 
world-renowned achievements are the result of the thorough 
implementation of the spirit of the 14th party congress and the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, as well as the result of hard struggle by people 
throughout the country, including the broad masses of returned 
Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese who have made 
efforts on various fronts, and the broad masses of Overseas 
Chinese who have given their support and concern. We sincerely 
thank them for the valuable contributions they have made to the 
prosperity and advancement of the Chinese nation. 
  The party and government have always attached importance to 
returned Overseas Chinese work and have considered the broad 
masses of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas 
Chinese, and Overseas Chinese as an important force for China's 
modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out many times 
that the broad masses of Overseas Chinese hope to see a 
prosperous and developed China, and he viewed giving play to the 
active role of Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity to 
greatly develop our country. The All-China Federation of 
Returned Overseas Chinese is a people's organization led by the 
CPC for unity with returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of 
Overseas Chinese of various circles; it is the bridge and link 
through which the party and government foster ties with returned 
Overseas Chinese, relatives of Overseas Chinese, and Overseas 
Chinese. The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese 
has already officially become a component of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, and has a larger and 
unique role to play in political consultation and democratic 
supervision. 
  Our country is currently facing a very important historical 
period. The development of the situation is raising new and 
higher demands on the federation of returned Overseas Chinese at 
various levels, and these federations should, under the 
leadership of the party and government, continue to develop a 
patriotic spirit, do a good job in education on collectivism and 
socialism, unite with the broad masses of returned Overseas 
Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, and arouse their 
enthusiasm and eagerness to work diligently for the country's 
prosperity, struggle hard, build the home towns of Overseas 
Chinese, and build the motherland. 
  The "PRC Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of 
Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Overseas Chinese," 
implemented in 1991, has embodied the government's concern for 
returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese and 
has enabled returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas 
Chinese to have a legal basis for the protection of their 
legitimate rights and interests; the federations of returned 
Overseas Chinese at various levels should help the government to 
do a good job in implementing the "PRC Law on Protecting the 
Rights and Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives 
of Overseas Chinese," and should do a good job in liaison 
between the government and returned Overseas Chinese and 
relatives of Overseas Chinese. 
  The federations of returned Overseas Chinese should go to 
the 
grass-roots levels and go deep into the realities of life in 
order to foster close ties with the broad masses of returned 
Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese, listen to 
their opinions and reflect their opinions, care for their 
sufferings, and properly serve them, really becoming the "close 
friend" of the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and 
relatives of Overseas Chinese. 
  The conference this time has commended nearly 1,000 advanced 
units and individuals and 10 outstanding persons from the 
circles of returned Overseas Chinese. They are the outstanding 
elements among the broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and 
relatives of Overseas Chinese; we sincerely congratulate them, 
and we hope to see more outstanding elements emerging. 
  One important task that the federations of returned Overseas 
Chinese at various levels must do well this time is liaison with 
Overseas Chinese. "Enable the returned Overseas Chinese to play 
their role as a bridge." They should help the relevant 
departments to vigorously develop economic, trade, scientific, 
technological, and cultural exchanges and cooperation with 
Overseas Chinese for the sake of reform, opening up, and 
modernization. On one hand, this can help Overseas Chinese to 
develop businesses and is conducive to the economic prosperity 
of the countries in which they are residing; on the other, this 
can promote the development of reform, opening up, and 
modernization in our country. 
  In order to accomplish their important duties and meet the 
needs arising from the development of the situation, the 
federations of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels must 
vigorously strengthen their own reform and construction efforts. 
Perfecting organization, training and assigning cadres, 
improving work style, and straightening out the management 
system have already become urgent tasks. 
  As far as the future is concerned, by the end of this 
century, our country will have initially built the socialist 
market economic system, will have realized the second-step 
development goal of reaching a comfortable living standard, and 
will have pushed the country's comprehensive national strength 
to a new level. In 1997 and 1999, our country will resume 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao respectively and will 
realize a smooth transition. This represents major progress in 
accomplishing the great undertaking of peaceful reunification of 
the motherland according to the principle of "one country, two 
systems." It is particularly important to do a good job in 
"Overseas Chinese" work at this critical time when the country 
confidently strides toward the 21st century and unity, 
prosperity, and civilization. It is hoped that the federations 
of returned Overseas Chinese at various levels will shoulder the 
important duties entrusted to them by the times, unite with the 
broad masses of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of 
Overseas Chinese, and, under the leadership of the party and 
government, work together wholeheartedly to make a larger 
contribution in the struggle for the motherland's peaceful 
reunification and prosperity.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- More than six million 
cadres throughout China took part in various training classes to 
study Deng Xiaoping's theories about building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics last year. 
  An official from the Organization Department of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said that 2.139 
million of the cadres studied in party schools at various levels 
or cadre-training institutes for over one month and 2.6 million 
attended different short-term training classes, while 1.232 
million are still studying in party schools. 
  They mainly studied the Volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping and books on the socialist market economy 
and on modern science and technology. 
  During the period from October last year to May this year, 
the CPC Central Committee held four theory symposiums, which 
were attended by 175 leading officials at provincial level. 
They discussed important issues related to China's socialist 
modernization drive. 
  Special attention was paid to training young cadres. Nearly 
800,000 young cadres have received various kinds of training in 
party schools at various levels. 
  As a result, a swathe of personnel who know how to manage 
the 
market economy and are familiar with an export-oriented economy 
have been brought up. 
  The CPC Central Committee has paid great attention to 
construction of cadre training centers. By 1993, there were 
6,944 party schools and management institutes with over 109,000 
specialized teachers.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As of 1 
June, the China Press and Publications Administration began to 
control the total quantity of book registration numbers used by 
publishing houses. Books to be published in one year will be 
controlled at the level of some 70,000. 
  In recent years, some publishing houses in China published a 
large quantity of books beyond the scope of their business, or 
even resold book registration numbers for profit. After 1985, 
book registration numbers increased by an average of 15 percent 
each year. This seriously affected book quality. Recently, 
three publishing houses in Beijing which seriously violated the 
relevant regulations were ordered to suspend operations. They 
were China Broadcast and Television Publishing House, Beijing 
Yanshan Publishing House, and Haiyang Publishing House. 
  In its recent circular, the China Press and Publications 
Administration laid down rules for controlling the use of book 
registration numbers every year. In the future, if any 
publishing houses are found to be reselling book registration 
numbers for profit, the numbers they can use will be reduced by 
over 15 percent.

  [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- With the approval of the 
State Planning Commission, a new highway bridge will be 
constructed across the country's biggest river, the Chiang 
Jiang, in central China's Hubei Province. 
  The construction of the bridge will bring closer the two key 
grain production areas in China -- the Jianghan plain and the 
Dongting Lake plain. At present transportation is by ferry 
across the river. 
  The four-lane bridge will be 4,015 m [meters] long and 25 m 
wide. 
  The total cost of the bridge is expected to be 1.13 billion 
yuan (about 130 million U.S. dollars). 
  Some 60 million U.S. dollars of the cost will be in the form 
of loans from Japan. 
  Construction is scheduled to start in 1995, and the bridge 
should open to traffic in 2000. 
  The bridge is named the Jingsha highway bridge as it will 
stretch from the cities of Jingzhou and Shashi and to the Gongan 
county.

  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (CNS) -- According to the China 
Coal Industrial Import and Export Corporation, China will 
strengthen its construction of railways and ports in order to 
increase its coal export, and by the year of 2,000, the volume 
of such export will increase to 30 million tonnes. 
  Relevant experts at a conference on coal production recently 
held in Australia predicted that China would become an important 
country for coal export in the world. With the rapid 
development of coal industry, China would in the near future 
provoke a threat to Australia's status as the biggest coal 
export country in the world. 
  In 1992, China exported 20.2 million tonne coal to more than 
20 countries and regions and its coal markets overseas were 
mainly in Asia and Europe. But this year such an export is 
predicted to be 22 million tonnes. 
  China now is still practicing a monopolized policy on the 
management of this special commodity and only some specialized 
companies designated by the state are allowed to engage in 
coal's sales. 
  At present, coal export from China has made up two percent 
of 
its total output and accounted for about five percent of the 
total coal trade in the world market.

  [Text] Qingdao, June 21 (CNS)--When attending the China 
textile and clothing products trade fair held here recently, the 
Chairman of the China Textile Council, Ms Wu Wenying, said the 
textile industry in China was not a declining industry. There 
was bright prospects for development of China's textile industry. 
  --Since the textile industry in China has plunged into a 
temporary predicament, a dispute on whether the textile industry 
in China is a declining industry has been going on among 
specialists in the economic circle. Elaborating on this 
question, Ms Wu said it was wrong to call the textile industry a 
declining one. Up to date, the output value of the textile 
industry remained one-sixth of the total industrial value of the 
country. Tax on its profit and the total income from its retail 
sales made up one-sixth each of those of the whole country. Its 
export value was even grater, making up 30 percent of that of 
the country. Since the reform and the open-door policy started 
fifteen years before, Ms Wu said, profit from and tax levied on 
the textile industry was as high as RMB 310 billion [renminbi] 
for the country and earned U.S.$160 billion from its export, 
unmatchable by any other industry in China. Even in 1993 which 
was the most difficult year for the industry, it still handed 
over more than 20 billion renminbi to the state and earned 
U.S.$27 billion from its export, indicating the textile industry 
remained one of the pillar industries of China. 
  -- Ms Wu said any country in the world would have to start 
from the light and textile industries in its course from a 
developing country to a developed one. China was still a big 
agricultural country and its productive forces remained at the 
primary stage of development. It was impossible for China's 
hi-tech industries to catch up with the level of the developed 
countries overnight. China must depend on the light and textile 
industries to accumulate wealth and to lay a strong foundation. 
Therefore, Ms Wu said, the textile industry would still 
function as one of the pillar industries before China became a 
developed country by mid-21st century. 
  -- Ms Wu said in view of the situation that the top-notch 
fashionable dress and materials for clothes-making were mostly 
imported, there existed great potential in the textile industry 
in China. Besides, the two fields including the decorative 
cloth and cloth for industrial use needed to be developed. In 
the developed countries, Ms Wu said, garment, textile products 
for decoration and for industrial use usually made up one-third 
of products of the textile industry respectively. In China, 
however, only garment made up 70 percent of the textile industry 
products. Therefore, there was bright prospects for the 
development of the textile industry in China.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Construction is to 
start soon on an irrigation and power-generation project on 
China's second-longest river, the Yellow River [Huang He]. 
  The Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project is claimed to be the 
second-largest water-conservancy scheme after the Three Gorges 
Dam on the Chang Jiang river. 
  There will be a 154-m-high dam with 15 large tunnels and a 
spillway to divert the river, handle floods, generate power and 
control sediment. 
  In April this year the World Bank approved a loan of 570 
million U.S. dollars for the project, which will take nine years 
to complete. 
  Flooding problems along the Yellow River date back thousands 
of years, as do China's efforts to harness the river. 
  Each year 400 million tons of silt is deposited downstream, 
raising the riverbed. 
  It took half a century for experts on water conservancy to 
identify Xiaolangdi, where the middle and lower reaches meet, as 
the ideal place for a dam to harness the Yellow River. The 
project got the go-ahead from China's National People's Congress 
in 1991. 
  Located about 130 km downstream from the Sanmen Gorges Dam 
in 
central China's Henan Province, the Xiaolangdi Reservoir will 
have a designed storage capacity of 12.6 billion cu m. 
  Zhu Yunxiang, who oversees the entire project, said that 
when 
completed, the dam, together with other reservoirs nearby, will 
enable the lower reaches of the river to withstand floods of a 
magnitude that occurs only once in 1,000 years. 
  In the first 36 years after it is put into use the dam will 
be able to prevent 7.3 billion tons of silt from flowing 
downstream, reversing the present buildup trend. 
  The project will also help control the ice jams which occur 
every spring downstream. 
  The reservoir will pump an additional four billion cu m of 
water a year for agricultural and industrial use along the lower 
reaches. It will generate up to six billion kwh of electricity a 
year. 
  The Xiaolangdi Dam is one of the most costly projects funded 
by the World Bank, which since 1988 sent 15 delegations to 
conduct assessments before giving it the nod in April this year. 
  In May this year two Chinese, one French and one Italian 
company won bids to construct the three main parts of dam. 
  Zhu Yunxiang said, "for all competitors, the huge investment 
is a money-making opportunity." 
  Zhu added that there are complicated technical problems in 
the construction of the mammoth project. 
  Preparatory work, which cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 
137 million U.S. dollars), was completed last month after two 
years' effort by a workforce of 15,000. It includes facilities 
for transportation and telecommunications, water and electricity 
supplies and accommodation for workers.

  [Text] Lanzhou, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The economically 
developed coastal areas in China have made it a point to man 
leading posts with officials from poorer western China to serve 
under capable local officials so that they can learn the 
expertise involved in economic operations and apply it after 
they return to their native places. 
  This has proved to be an effective way to help develop the 
economies of western China as their officials have become more 
and more capable. 
  In recent years Gansu Province, one of the poor areas in 
northwest China, has sent over 300 officials to developed areas 
such as Zhejiang Province in the east and Tianjin Municipality 
in the north to work for a period of time to learn from local 
experience; in return, officials from the developed coastal 
areas have gone to remote areas to help them develop their 
economies. 
  The officials from Gansu have not only learned the skills of 
marketing and economic operations, they have also helped to 
introduce over 100 technical projects to boost the economies of 
their native places. 
  The past 15 years of reform and opening up in China have 
brought great changes to the eastern and southern parts of 
China, but the northwest has made comparatively less progress 
because of poor natural conditions and other factors. 
  Since 1991, when Jiangsu and Shaanxi Provinces first started 
exchanges of officials, other provinces have followed suit, and 
officials exchanges have been carried out between Beijing and 
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shandong and Shaanxi 
Provinces, and Zhejiang Province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous 
Region. 
  The exchanges involve more than 10,000 officials at various 
levels. 
  Officials from Shandong and Jiangsu working in 59 poor 
counties and cities in the west have held a dozen training 
courses for over 10 million people. 
  They have also helped western areas set up over 250 joint 
ventures which recorded 440 million yuan (about 50 million U.S. 
dollars) in output value last year. 
  Scientists and technicians from the Tianjin Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences have helped farmers and herdsmen in the 
west learn vegetable storage and cross breeding. 
  At the same time, officials from the poor areas have their 
eyes opened by the brisk market economy in the east. 
  People from Xinjiang have learned advanced management 
techniques and helped introduce advanced equipment to their 
hometowns to promote the development of the chemicals, textiles 
and electronics industries, as well as agricultural production. 
  Meanwhile, such exchanges have promoted economic and 
technical co-operation. Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, and the 
Xinjiang Uygur, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Regions have signed contracts of cooperation in funds 
and labor with the developed areas. 
  The developed areas benefit as well from the exchanges as 
they receive raw materials and energy from the underdeveloped 
areas. 
  Some political and economic analysts hold that the officials 
exchanges have brought new changes in the circulation of 
personnel, technology, commodities and resources between the 
east and the west.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The Chinese 
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently formulated 
management regulations on raising and lowering the prices of 
metallurgical products. The main points are as follows: 
  1. Raising or lowering metallurgical product prices is an 
important component of metallurgical product prices. These 
prices are verified by the state according to the users' needs 
and product quality on the basis of the existing or partially 
promulgated state criteria for metallurgical products. Whether 
an enterprise increases or reduces its metallurgical product 
prices must be based on the user's proposal, and the lowered or 
raised prices must be clarified in the contract that is signed. 
  2. The names, sizes, physical properties, chemical 
components, and specifications of products listed in the 
catalogue of "ex-factory prices of metallurgical products" are 
governed by the existing or partially promulgated state 
criteria. If the names, sizes, physical properties, chemical 
components, or specifications of metallurgical products are not 
covered by the existing or partially promulgated state criteria, 
the enterprise's criteria or the technical requirements set by 
both parties' agreement can be taken as the basis. 
  3. Raising or lowering the state-set or state-guided prices 
of products must strictly proceed in accordance with the 
catalogue of "ex-factory prices of metallurgical products." If 
an enterprise reduces a product's chemical component according 
to its internally controlled criteria for production, changes 
its workmanship, improves its precision, or increases its 
inspection, but does not do so at the user's request, it cannot 
raise the product's price. 
  4. Raising or lowering the state-set prices of products must 
proceed under the management of the Ministry of Metallurgical 
Industry; localities or enterprises are not allowed to change 
prices without authorization. 
  5. Raising or lowering the market prices of iron and steel 
products must be discussed by both parties and explained in 
their purchase and sales contracts.

  [Text] Hefei, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Notorious as an unruly 
river in central China, the Huaihe river has now been tamed 
after 40 years of effort. 
  The river flows through Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong and 
Hubei Provinces, and its valley covers 270,000 sq km. Both the 
population and cultivated land in the valley account for one 
eighth of the country's total. 
  As a result of its geographic location in the transitional 
belt between southern and northern climates, the valley floods 
during torrential rains and suffers from severe drought if there 
is no rain. 
  Soon after China's liberation in 1949 the central government 
mobilized farmers and invested 50 billion yuan to construct 
irrigation facilities. 
  The people of the valley have dug 12 new river courses with 
a 
combined length of 1,400 km and built 5,300 reservoirs able to 
store 25 billion cu m of water and other irrigation facilities. 
  Now the irrigated areas in the valley have expanded to 7.3 
million ha, ten times more than in the period before liberation 
in 1949. 
  The output of grain produced in the valley accounts for one 
sixth of the country's total, and that of cotton and oil-bearing 
crops for one fourth.

  [Excerpt] The date 16 June 1994 marks the 70th anniversary 
of the Military Academy and the 70th anniversary of the founding 
of the Huangpu [Whampoa] Army. President Li Teng-hui issued a 
message of greetings to mark the occasion, exhorting the Armed 
Forces to carry forward the Huangpu spirit, to shoulder heavy 
responsibility, to safeguard national security, to be the 
cornerstone of social stability, to be the means for building 
and reforming the nation, and to be the backup force for 
national unification. 
  President Li said: The founding of the Republic of China 
[ROC] is aimed at building a wealthy, strong, and unified 
country to enable all Chinese countrymen to be blessed by the 
Three Principles of the People. Although this goal has been 
initially achieved in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, our 
compatriots on Mainland China are still living under Communist 
totalitarian rule. Our country is still in a divided state and 
is still being ruled separately. Moreover, Communist China's 
threat against Taiwan -- our national rejuvenation base -- has 
always been there. 
  President Li pointed out: Therefore, currently our work, on 
the one hand, should be aimed at building up the Armed Forces 
and heightening combat readiness to ensure Taiwan's security, 
and at gaining the initiative in developing relations with the 
mainland. On the other hand, we should endeavor to sustain 
Taiwan's economic development and to promote democracy and 
constitutional rule, so that we may use a more spectacular 
"Taiwan Miracle" to induce a peaceful change on the mainland and 
to pursue national unification in a democratic way so the people 
can enjoy freedom and equal distribution of wealth. Therefore, 
the Armed Forces' tasks not only have not been reduced because 
of the end of the period of mobilization for suppressing the 
Communist rebellion; on the contrary, the nation's reliance on 
the Armed Forces will increase as the country carries out 
national building and reform in all fields. 
  President Li said: This year marks the 70th anniversary of 
the founding of the nation's Armed Forces. Over the last 70 
years, to fulfill Dr. Sun Yat-sen's wishes and to rescue the 
nation from great dangers, the Armed Forces, under the 
leadership of late President Chiang Kai-shek, have successfully 
carried out the Northern Expedition with a small army against 
larger ones, and have won the War of Resistance Against Japan 
with a weaker army against a stronger one. And, over the last 
40 years and more, our officers and men of the new generation 
have smashed Communist China's repeated armed provocations in 
the Taiwan Strait. They not only have strengthened the national 
rejuvenation base to provide a secure and stable environment for 
developing the "Taiwan Miracle," but also have laid a foundation 
for achieving national unification in a democratic way so the 
people can enjoy freedom and equal distribution of wealth.

<F P=106> [Article contributed by Lu Hsiu-lian, Taiwan Democratic </F>
Progressive Party Legislative Branch member, to the "Forum" 
column: "Expose and Analyze the Hangzhou Court's Hoax; An Urgent 
Appeal Arising From the Qiandao Lake Incident"] 
  [Excerpts] History Seems To Be Repeating Itself, With 
the Only Difference Being That Time and Space Have Changed 
  The time was changed from March 1980 to June 1994, and the 
place was moved from Taipei's Chingmei Military Tribunal to the 
Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court, the difference being that 
the Kuomintang ordered its court to indict eight Taiwan 
democratic fighters on sedition charges and that the CPC ordered 
the Hangzhou court to sentence three young Chinese men to die on 
charges of robbery and murder. Two different cases; hence, 
different meanings. But the method which the Chinese Communists 
used to try the culprits who were involved in the Qiandao Lake 
incident was almost identical to the one adopted by the 
Kuomintang 14 years ago when it put on trial those involved in 
the Kaohsiung incident. Because, however, of the valiant 
defense put up by those who were charged in the Kaohsiung 
incident and their lawyers, the Kuomintang's prepared script 
went awry. Following a successive retraction of confessions 
extracted during interrogations and the launching of a 
counterattack, the eight "most wanted persons of the Kuomintang" 
survived their courtroom ordeal. Woe betide the three young men 
in Hangzhou who will be made the scapegoats and who will pay 
with their lives within days for the vicious killings on Qiandao 
Lake, thus adding three more wronged ghosts to the netherworld. 
  I was the first one who openly retracted a forced confession 
during the great trial in the military court many years ago. 
Because I have been working on behalf of the families of the 
Qiandao Lake incident's victims, I know instantly the hypocrisy 
and the illegality of the trial by the Hangzhou intermediate 
court of the three persons who were charged with robbery and 
murder. The Hangzhou intermediate court has violated the "human 
rights" safeguard standard as set forth in modern international 
law -- that is, all have the right to an open and free trial. 
<H5>  Seriously Violate the "Due Process of Law" </H5>
  I had intended to go with the families of the victims to 
Hangzhou for the court hearing. Being unable to make the trip, 
I became resigned to reading newspaper reports about the case. 
I found that in handling this case, China has at least 
seriously violated the "due process of law." 
  1. The contents of the indictment document have not been 
made known to the public. The families of the victims and their 
lawyers also have not received copies of the indictment. Even 
the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] said that it has no idea 
about the contents of the indictment. 
  2. Although claiming an open trial, the court did not allow 
the lawyers of the victims' families or Taiwan legislators to 
attend the court proceedings. The SEF was notified, just 24 
hours before the opening of the trial, that it would be allowed 
to send a person "in his capacity as an individual" to attend 
the court hearing. This was too late, because there were 
neither flights nor enough time to reach Hangzhou. It was 
reported that most of the people who attended the court hearing 
dressed well. Men were reported wearing Western suits and women 
wearing traditional Chinese-style dresses. They were apparently 
senior Communist officials. At the center of the courtroom 
there hung a red cloth banner with the words "The Qiandao Lake 
incident trial court" written on it. It looked rather like the 
holding of a wedding reception or the staging of a theatrical 
play. It was completely out of place for a court which was 
supposed to be holding a great trial of robbers and murderers 
who had committed the heinous crime of killing 32 people. 
  3. Reporters were prohibited from attending the court 
hearing. They were only allowed to watch the court hearing on a 
television at a building across the court. Photos and 
videotaping were also forbidden. Many plainclothesmen 
surreptitiously took photos of or videotaped reporters who were 
at the scene to cover the event. The Communists even brazenly 
offered to sell reporters a 20-minute censored and edited 
videotape of the trial for $100. 
  4. The trial was conducted on 10-11 June. The three persons 
who were accused of the crime each were given two death 
sentences on the morning of 12 June. But, 12 June was a Sunday. 
There is no country in the world which holds trials on Sundays. 
It was also strange and uncommon that the Hangzhou court 
hastily handed down death sentences on Sunday, just one day 
before the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on 13 June and 
which is one of China's three major festivals and a day for 
family reunions. It was a great feat indeed that they managed 
to finish drafting, typing, and proof-reading a long-winded 
court verdict just a few hours after the trial. All this points 
to the fact that the Communist authorities wanted to speedily 
conclude the case and that the court verdict had already been 
prepared before the trial opened. The court trial was nothing 
but a political farce. 
<H5>  Flatly Reject the Legitimacy and Authenticity of the Trial </H5>
  The above are the serious procedural flaws that I found in 
the course of the Qiandao Lake trial. People who did not the 
trial also can discern these criticisms, but if one were present 
at the trial, one surely would have found even more instances of 
absurdity and hypocrisy. Because of these obvious and serious 
procedural flaws, we of course question whether the three who 
were charged with the crime were the real culprits. Therefore, 
we should categorically reject the legitimacy and authenticity 
of the verdict. 
  As a matter of fact, we can detect a great deal of 
whitewashing even from the limited images contained in the 
doctored videotape. When arriving at the court to stand trial, 
the three persons who were accused of the crime wore smiles and 
were at ease. They did not look like vicious robbers who had 
committed such a heinous crime. When recounting the commission 
of the crime, they readily answered questions while cooperating 
perfectly with the judge. They even consulted prepared notes 
when replying to the judge's questions. They seemed to be 
memorizing the script. They did not give a slightest impression 
that an imminent disaster would soon befall them. They also did 
not betray a trace of fear that their heads would soon be 
chopped off. 
  That scene reminded me of the Wu Tai-an communist spy case, 
which occurred one year before the Kaohsiung incident. [passage 
omitted] 
  Are Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun the real culprits who 
were involved in the Qiandao Lake incident and who cruelly 
killed 32 people? Were they capable of committing such a 
heinous crime? With what sort of weapons did they commit the 
crime? We've got to know the answers to these questions, 
because these have to do with the real truth of the tragedy and 
with the criminal responsibility of the three accused persons. 
However, the accounts given in the court by the three accused 
persons were evasive, farfetched, and tended to avoid the 
important and dwell on the trivial when it came to the important 
points. The judge did not have the slightest intention of 
energetically pursuing the case by asking more penetrating 
questions, and he left major suspicious points unclarified. For 
instance, were there more than three persons who committed the 
crime? What kinds of guns were used in the crime? What was the 
actual situation of the setting of the boat on fire? What were 
the real causes of death? Were the victims killed by gunshots? 
Were they burned to death? Or, were they just asphyxiated? 
These issues were all left unprobed. One can see clearly that 
the truth of the case had not been brought to light with the 
conclusion of the two-day trial. Instead, the truth may never 
be known because of the hurried sentencing and execution of the 
three accused persons. 
<H5>  We Should Never Allow Ourselves To Be Treated as Idiots and </H5>
as the Meat on the Chopping Block 
  Following the handing down of the verdict, presiding Judge 
Yang Gang immediately called a news conference at which he 
insisted that there were only three culprits and that "there 
were absolutely no other people involved in this case." The 
chairman of Zhejiang's Taiwan affairs office also called on 
Taiwan compatriots to believe in the sincerity of the Chinese 
Communists and not to let the Qiandao Lake incident affect the 
feelings between the people living on both sides of the strait 
and hamper the "virtuous development" of the cross-strait 
relationship. 
  Well, if this is their wish, then why didn't they let 
lawyers 
representing the families of the victims attend the court 
hearing? Why didn't they allow reporters to visit the scene of 
the crime? Why did they go to such unusual lengths in covering 
up the case following its occurrence? These all point to the 
fact that there must have been a cover-up of the Qiandao Lake 
incident. There must be other real culprits. 
  Even when things have reached such a state, the Communist 
authorities still treat the "Taiwan compatriots" like idiots; 
they still want to treat Taiwan as the meat on the chopping 
block. 
  My dear Taiwan compatriots, do you still want to be treated 
like idiots by the Communists? 
  Here is a warning to those incompetent officials at the SEF 
and Mainland Affairs Council: If you still continue to treat 
Taiwan as meat on the chopping block for others to chop, we will 
surely force you to step down.

  [Text] Since 13 June, Fujian's Nanping, Sanming, Longyan, 
Ningde, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and some other areas have been hit by 
heavy torrential rains and severe flooding. Weather and 
hydrological forecasts have indicated that most parts of Fujian 
are expected to be hit by another torrential rainfall and even 
more severe flooding over the next two to three days. 
  In view of this situation, the provincial party committee 
and 
government yesterday morning called an emergency flood 
prevention and disaster relief meeting. Provincial Party 
Committee Secretary Jia Qinglin delivered a speech, in which he 
emphatically called for attaching top priority to the safety of 
the people's lives and property and taking forceful measures to 
reduce flood losses to a minimum. 
  The provincial party committee general office and provincial 
people's government general office jointly issued a emergency 
circular yesterday, calling for further improving the province's 
flood prevention and disaster relief work. 
  The circular stated: All areas in the province should keep 
close watch over the torrential rain and flooding, should take 
necessary precautions, should make the necessary preparations, 
and should strive to reduce flood losses to a minimum losses. 
Leaders at all levels in the province should become 
ideologically prepared to combat large-scale natural calamities, 
including a large-scale flood. The principal leaders at all 
levels in the province should personally take charge of the 
on-going flood prevention and disaster relief work, should go 
deep into each and every flood prevention front, as well as 
organize and mobilize the broad masses of cadres and people to 
combat the flood and provide disaster relief. 
  The circular also urged disaster-stricken areas across the 
province to more energetically push ahead with the on-going 
flood prevention and disaster relief work, to take forceful 
measures so as to resume production as soon as possible, 
particularly grain production, and to strive for a sustained 
increase in the province's grain output this year. The relevant 
departments across the province should waste no time in 
transporting and delivering relief funds and goods to the 
disaster-stricken areas to assist flood prevention and disaster 
relief work. The agricultural, civil affairs, water 
conservancy, and insurance departments at all levels in the 
province should also organize and dispatch personnel to the 
disaster-stricken areas to help grassroots units and people 
tackle problems and overcome production and livelihood 
difficulties.

  [Text] Fuzhou, June 20 (CNS) -- Railway service from 
Fuzhou to elsewhere across the country came to a halt effective 
at 2 a.m. this morning because there were landslides along the 
railway lines caused by heavy rain. 
  Since the mid-June, various places along domestic railway 
lines within Fujian Province were hit by torrential rain, which 
was over 180 millimetres on average and up to some 400 
millimetres in some places. Landslides because of floods 
occurred along the Yongan branch railway line and outbound 
railway lines between June 17 and 19. Roadbed was undermined, 
culverts blocked up and tracks buried by mud. The 92-kilometre 
outbound railway line between Laizhou and Gutian was badly hit 
since early morning on June 19 when railway service there 
stopped. 
  Officials from each section of outbound railway lines went 
to 
the scene to direct the flood control and emergency repair in 
order to make railway service from Fuzhou to elsewhere across 
the country resume as soon as possible.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Five foreign 
companies have won bids for supplying the latest technology to 
the Shanghai Baoshan Steel Plant for manufacturing a 1,420-mm 
cold rolling production line. 
  Three companies are from Germany, one from Japan and one 
from 
the United States. They include the German firms of Siemens and 
Schloemann-Siemag Aktiengesellschaft and the Nippon Steel 
Corporation of Japan. 
  An official of the modern plant said that, instead of 
importing a whole set of the technology and equipment, the plant 
will mainly import the latest technology and cooperate with 
these companies in design and manufacturing of the equipment. 
  According to the official, the plant will build three sets 
of 
cold rollers to produce cold-rolled steel plates, tin-plated 
plates, electrical steel and silicon steel plates. 
  The agreement signed here today includes manufacturing of a 
cold roller mill with an annual capacity of 70,000 tons of 1,420 
mm tin-planted sheets ranging 0.18-0.55 mm in thickness.

  [Text] Hangzhou, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Since the start of the 
rainy season, heavy and at times torrential rain has fallen in 
Zhejiang Province, causing flooding. Provincial party committee 
and government leaders, including secretary Li Zemin and 
Governor Wan Xueyuan, have gone to the frontline to direct 
rescue operations and the fight against the flooding. 
Throughout the province a million cadres and people are 
participating in the flood-fighting struggle to save themselves 
and rebuild their homes. 
  Heavy to torrential rainfall has hit Zhejiang since 8 June, 
with more than 300 mm falling in 80 percent of the province and 
more than 500 mm in 10 percent of the province. Throughout the 
province rivers and the river network on the plain rose beyond 
the warning level, causing flooding. Along the Qiantang Jiang 
and Puyang Jiang, in particular, flood waters have risen to 
super-dangerous level three times in 10 days. 
  According to preliminary figures, at present 925 villages 
and 
towns and 6.19 million mu of farmland throughout the province 
have been damaged by floods. About 1 million mu of this 
farmland had not been harvested. About 30,200 houses have 
collapsed and 8,600 factories have been forced to suspend 
production or operate at half capacity. A number of water 
conservation projects and highway bridges have also been 
destroyed. 
  Various localities and departments in Zhejiang have 
demonstrated the spirit of collectivism, heeding unity and 
taking the overall interest into consideration, in their rescue 
work and flood fighting. 
  For 11 years the Xinanjiang Hydroelectric Power Station, the 
first giant hydropower station built by New China, has not 
opened its sluices to release flood waters. To reduce economic 
losses in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain as much as possible, 
the provincial government decided on 14 June to open the sluices 
and release flood water. The flood water flowed safely into the 
sea after local cadres and the masses completed work to 
strengthen the dam, clearing obstacles, and relocating residents 
as quickly as possible. 
  The sluices of the Xinanjiang Reservoir have been opened 
twice so far to release flood waters, playing a pivotal role in 
water control. 
  The province has decided to urgently arrange the 
distribution 
of 50 million kg of grain from its reserve, as well as some 
diesel oil, chemical fertilizer, and other materials to help 
flood-stricken areas.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The Shenzhen Ocean 
Oil and Gas Co. Ltd, the first share-holding offshore oil 
enterprise in China, has been set up in Zhanjiang City in south 
China's Guangdong Province. 
  The company was established on the basis of the former 
Huayang Industrial Company of the China Marine Petroleum South 
China Sea West Corporation and its Shenzhen office. 
  With 20 million yuan in registered funds and over 80 million 
yuan-worth of shares, the newly-established company will engage 
in processing crude oil, trading in oil products, handling real 
estate, running hotels, handling tourism, financial and 
securities business, construction and repair of marine oilfield 
equipment, transportation of marine oil and shipbuilding. 
  The company's shares are divided into state-owned shares, 
legal entity shares, corporate aggregate shares and shares held 
by employees of the company. 
  The western part of the South China Sea area has proved to 
be 
rich in natural gas resources. Its total reserve of natural gas 
is estimated at 1.444 billion cu m, accounting for one third of 
the country's total reserves of natural gas. 
  Experts note that the new company will help accelerate the 
opening up of the natural gas fields in the western part of the 
South China Sea.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Shenzhen has been given two years to strengthen 
border defences and boost popular support for the military in 
the lead-up to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, according to 
an official report. Beijing is believed to share fears in the 
territory that a flood of mainlanders will flock towards Hong 
Kong after the handover. 
  Growing friction between people and soldiers in Shenzhen are 
also a source of unease in Beijing. The government fears that 
this friction will be repeated in Hong Kong because the same 
units are to be deployed in the territory. 
  China's Defence Ministry has authorised a huge outlay in 
cash 
and loans to expand military bases in the special economic zone 
and the adjacent Bao'an district. The executive vice-mayor, 
Wang Zhongfu, revealed the plans in remarks made on Tuesday, 
according to extracts of the speech carried in the Shenzhen 
Special Zone Daily. 
  "Our aim should be to consolidate national defences and 
foster a stable social and economic environment," he said. Over 
the next two years, border defences would be strengthened "to 
take into account Shenzhen's special location and historical 
mission". 
  In the past three years, more than 78 million renminbi 
(HK$69.3m [Hong Kong dollars] ) in funding and 190,000 square 
metres in additional land have gone into strengthening military 
bases in Shenzhen. 
  An additional Rmb20m [renminbi] would be lent this year by 
the city for new military training centres, one of them at the 
Pinghu district base. 
  In a sign that Beijing may be planning to increase the 
number 
of troops stationed in Shenzhen, Wang said finding jobs for 
families accompanying new soldiers would be a big task. A total 
of 598 spouses of soldiers had been given jobs in city 
departments over the past three years, and 380 children of 
soldiers placed in schools. 
  Citizens drafted into military service would be given a 
"complimentary salary" of Rmb2,000 per year, 16 per cent more 
than draftees were paid in 1991. Wang's speech was made after 
Beijing declared Shenzhen a "double support model city" on June 
3. 
  "Double support" refers to attempts by Beijing since the 
Tiananmen Square massacre to blunt popular dislike of the 
military through a series of activities which espouse mutual 
support between civilians and bureaucrats on the one side and 
soldiers on the other. 
  "With the handover of Hong Kong coming closer, carrying out 
'double support' work well...will be beneficial for the 
convergence of Shenzhen and Hong Kong," Wang said. He said 
clashes between soldiers and civilians in Shenzhen, most of 
which occurred outside military bases, must be "cut off at the 
bud". 
  "Our work still leaves a certain amount to be desired," he 
said. "We cannot be satisfied with the present situation and 
just sit on our haunches." 
  To improve living conditions for soldiers, food allowances 
will be boosted by Rmb30 a month.

  [Text] After the regional party committee and government 
held a 17 June meeting of leading cadres of departments directly 
under the jurisdiction of the regional government to make 
arrangements for flood fighting and relief work, the general 
offices of the regional party committee and government held 
another such meeting on the afternoon of 20 June to make further 
arrangements for flood fighting and relief work, at which 
regional government General Secretary (Liu Xianye) transmitted 
the regional party committee's suggestions for calling on 
departments directly under the jurisdiction of the regional 
government to support the flood fighting and relief work effort. 
Deputy Secretary General (Pan Hongquan) made specific 
arrangements for the offering of donations for flood-stricken 
areas. 
  The meeting urged departments directly under the 
jurisdiction 
of the regional government to exert great efforts and make great 
contributions in the current donation activities. This will 
help solve some problems. While actively taking the lead in 
donating money and goods, leading cadres of departments directly 
under the jurisdiction of the regional government should 
earnestly mobilize cadres, staff members, and workers to do 
their utmost to donate money and goods. All units should try 
their best to distribute fewer bonuses and subsidies and to take 
some money from earnings outside the plan for donations for 
flood-hit areas. Enterprises that achieve good economic results 
should be mobilized to make contributions in helping the flooded 
areas with their donations. Donations of clothing, mosquito 
nets, quilts, and daily necessities, which are currently badly 
needed by flood victims, should be mobilized first. 
  According to the two general secretaries, the regional 
leading comrades, including regional party Secretary Zhao Fulin, 
have indicated that provincial leading cadres at the deputy 
level and above will donate 500 yuan or so each. Moreover, the 
offices of the regional party committee and government have 
stated that they will donate 300,000 yuan each.

  [Text] Nanning, June 18 (CNS) -- The Director of the 
Public Security Bureau of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 
Mr. Lin Chaoqun, said here that remarkable achievement had been 
made in the Region's campaign against drug and gun trafficking. 
  Mr. Lin said during the period from June of last year to May 
this year, the Region had uncovered 5008 drug cases, more than 
500 of them being big cases. Over 700-kilogram opium, 
120-kilogram heroin, 16-kilogram caffeine and RMB [renminbi] 2.4 
million gained from drug trafficking had been seized. Some 189 
cases of gun trafficking had been also uncovered with 346 guns, 
8200 rounds of ammunition as well as over 360 grenades, 
flashlights and mines seized. 
  Special efforts must be made in areas teeming with such 
illegal activities. The areas, according to Guangxi, include 
frontier area connecting the Region with Vietnam, the juncture 
between the Region and Yunnan Province, Guizhou City and 
Guangdong Province. Hubs of communications in the Region such 
as Nanning City, Liuzhou City and Wuzhou City as well as the 
important communication lines and districts along these lines. 
  It was reported that drug taking situation in the Region had 
been rampant with drug market there expanding. According to the 
authoritative statistics, drug addicts in the Region have 
reached nearly 40,000 in number covering 6 cities, 8 prefectures 
and 79 counties there. A special campaign against drug 
underground market has been staged in Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou 
and Beihai at present to curb drug addiction. In frontier 
areas, more than 250,000 opium poppies have been rooted out. 
  Serious punishment had been imposed on criminals engaging in 
drug and gun trafficking. From June of last year till May this 
year, among 326 criminals arrested, 209 of them had been 
sentenced to different terms of imprisonment with 16 of them 
sentenced to death, 11 sentenced to suspended death and 21 to 
life imprisonment. On June 26 this year, the international day 
for banning drugs, another batch of criminals will be put to 
death in the region. 
  Mr. Lin said drug trafficking cases in the Region had been 
increasing. In the former five months this year, such cases had 
increased by 60 percent than the same period of last year and 
heroin seized doubled that in the same period of last year. 
Therefore it would be still an arduous task for the Region to 
handle such problems.

  [Text] From 16 to 18 June in Zhuzhou, a provincial party 
school meeting was held, the dominant theme of which was to 
conscientiously implement the spirit of the national party 
school work conference with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit 
of the party's 14th National Congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as guides, study and 
solve new developments and problems facing party school work in 
the new situation in light of the realities in the province, 
further achieve unity in understanding, strengthen leadership, 
comprehensively deepen educational reform in party schools, and 
open up a new situation in the province's party school 
educational work. 
  Provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin and provincial party 
Deputy Secretary Yang Zhengwu addressed the meeting. Luo 
Haishan, Standing Committee member of and director of the 
organization department of the provincial party committee 
attended the meeting. 
  In his speech, Comrade Wang Maolin stressed: In the new 
situation of establishing a socialist market economic structure, 
the vast numbers of party members and cadres must study anew. 
What is most fundamental and important to study well is Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. He expounded on the great significance of 
further bringing the role of party schools into play in three 
ways-- upholding and consolidating the party's status as a 
ruling party, training qualified people who can cross into the 
next century, and improving the quality of our province's cadre 
ranks. 
  In his speech, Comrade Yang Zhengwu pointed out: Striving to 
run party schools well is a strategic measure to strengthen 
party building and the building of cadre ranks. Party 
committees at all levels must strengthen leadership over party 
school work, open up a new situation in the province's party 
school work, and make fresh contributions in promoting Hunan's 
reform and development.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Leading Cadres Must Shoulder the Important </F>
Task of Handling Well the Contradictions Among People -- On 
Relations Between Improving Leading Cadres' Workstyle and 
Handling Well the Contradictions Among People"] 
  [Text] At present, handling well the contradictions among 
the people under the new situation is of primary importance to 
deepening reform, promoting development, and stabilizing the 
general situation. To leading organs and leading cadres in 
particular, doing this work well has something to do with their 
method of work. However, what is more important is that they 
must further enhance their understanding and improve their work 
style. They must devote their vigorous efforts to these two 
kinds of work in order to achieve actual results. 
  Under the new situation of deepening reform, and 
accelerating 
the establishment of the socialist market economy system, owing 
to the fact that the adjustments and changes in interest 
relationships, uneven economic development, and changes in 
superstructure and concepts have conflicted with certain 
understandings and habits of the masses, many new contradictions 
taken shape among the people. These contradictions cannot be 
mentioned in the same breath as previous ones in terms of scope, 
degree, and complexity. Whether we can solve these 
contradictions well is a matter for concern in the general 
situation of reform, opening up, and socialist construction. 
Leading cadres at all levels must truly grasp this work well and 
treat it as a matter of primary importance. 
  To do this work well, leading cadres must further cultivate 
their workstyle of opposing corruption, advocating honesty and 
cleanliness, and overcoming bureaucracy. This is an important 
aspect in easing contradictions among the people. At present, 
what the masses in some localities complain about most is the 
failure of a handful of cadres to be clean and honest in their 
government administration, as well as their seriously 
bureaucratic workstyle. Many conflicts of interest have become 
complicated, or even antagonistic because of this. Therefore, 
enhancing understanding, devoting main efforts to solve the 
problem of failing to become clean and honest in government 
administration, taking the initiative to shoulder the 
responsibility of handling well the contradictions among the 
people are the vital issues leading cadres must solve. 
  First, it is necessary to set up correct relations between 
public servants and masters, always assign the interests of the 
masses a most important position, and bear in mind at all times 
the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. If we fail to 
set up such correct relations and to improve cadres' workstyle, 
the correctness of our policy decision and guideline for 
handling relations among the people, and the actual results of 
our problem-solving work will be affected. The masses are 
reasonable. As long as leading cadres respect them, are fair 
and selfless, and work for the masses wholeheartedly, they will 
win the support of the masses. Various kinds of contradictions 
will be mitigated. Some problems cannot be solved temporarily, 
owing to restrictions imposed by conditions. However, as long as 
the masses are aware of the real situation, they will make 
allowances for it. On the contrary, if leading cadres are not 
clean and honest in their government administration, or are 
filled with bureaucratic airs, or ride roughshod over the 
masses, or adopt a stiff and rude manner, this naturally will 
cause discontent among the masses. It will not be easy to solve 
contradictions, which might even become intensified. In the 
course of reform and opening up, it is not a terrifying thing to 
see that the number of contradictions has increased, and that 
they have become more complicated. What we are afraid of is 
that leading cadres are not clean and honest in their government 
administration, and are swollen with bureaucratic style. 
  Second, the key solution to overcoming leading cadres' 
defects of not being clean and honest in their government 
administration and of being swollen with bureaucracy, as well as 
the solution to handling well the contradictions among the 
people lies in reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: It 
is true that bureaucracy originated from cadres' ideological 
workstyle, but what is more important is that it is originated 
from our own systems. Owing to the overconcentration of power, 
leading organs at all levels have managed to handle things "they 
must not handle, or cannot handle well, or that are outside 
their concern." This is the "general root-cause" of all our 
bureaucracy. The various kinds of reforms we have been carrying 
out over the past 10 years or so -- such as delegating power, 
streamlining organs, improving the responsibility system, and 
transforming the cadre system -- actually are revolting against 
bureaucracy. Many contradictions among the people are solved 
precisely in such "revolts." In the future, therefore, we must 
continue to speed up the process of reform, and bring the 
improvement of leading cadres' workstyle and handling of 
contradictions among the people into the orbit of democracy and 
the legal system. We must let our people truly exercise the 
power conferred on them by the Constitution and the law. 
Whenever we take important measures, we must consult with the 
masses. Leading cadres must place themselves under the 
supervision of the broad masses of people. We must enhance the 
concepts of the cadres and masses regarding the legal system. 
No matter what kinds of contradictions and problems, they can 
be solved only within the scope of the laws, decrees, and 
systems of the state. In so doing, we not only can effectively 
overcome certain leading cadres' bureaucracy, but also 
effectively prevent a certain anarchism among the masses, so 
that contradictions among the people can be solved correctly and 
properly. At present, like the whole country, the situation in 
our province is favorable. On the road of advance, however, 
there are still some difficulties and problems. We must attach 
great importance to them, and never treat them lightly. Leading 
cadres at all levels -- and main leading cadres, in particular 
-- must solve prominent local problems in person, do ideological 
and political work well, unite with the masses, make joint 
efforts to maintain our stable political situation, and create a 
fine social environment so as to accelerate the establishment of 
the socialist market economy system, and to ensure the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our national 
economy.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The teaching of the 
Tibetan language in the Tibet Autonomous Region has become a 
compulsory course in all schools here, using unified textbooks. 
  Local officials said that efforts to popularize the language 
began a decade ago when the central government stressed the 
importance of preserving and developing national minorities' 
cultures, during an ethnic work conference. 
  Xigaze, the second biggest city in Tibet, is typical of the 
language teaching in the whole region. 
  At that time, the city was badly in need of Tibetan language 
teachers, and the local government employed people from the 
public, including some lamas from the monasteries. 
  Cendo, who is now 53 years old and used to be an ordinary 
lama in the well-known Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, has become a 
senior lecturer in the highest teaching institute around the 
entire Xigaze area -- the Xigaze Teachers' School. 
  The college is responsible for training teachers for local 
primary schools, especially Tibetan language teachers. 
  "Compared with other courses, Tibetan language teaching is 
being given more weight," said Cewang Doje, the college's head. 
  Seven of the teachers in its Tibetan teaching group are 
Tibetan language graduates from Tibet University. Since 1981, 
all the Tibetan teachers with the group have been gathering once 
a week in order to raise their teaching abilities. 
  Every semester, the group selects several teachers to give 
public classes for other teachers' appraisal. 
  More than 90 percent of the graduates from this teachers' 
college have been found to be capable of teaching the Tibetan 
language in the first to sixth grade in primary schools, and 
some can be selected to teach at secondary schools. 
  More and more young people in Tibet are now willing to do 
their best to revitalize their own native language. 
  Zhamdui, after senior high school, had been enlisted in the 
Tibetan Language Department of Tibet University and has been in 
the teachers' school for five years after his graduation. 
  "Tibetan is our native language, so we must master it well 
so 
as to hold on to and develop our fine cultural traditions," the 
young man said.

  [Text] Lhasa, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Tibet has just started 
eight major construction projects in three river valleys -- 
those of the Yarlung Zangbo, the Lhasa and the Nyangqu -- as 
part of efforts to boost the economic development of this 
underdeveloped autonomous region. 
  With an investment of 222.8 million yuan so far, these 
projects, to be completed in two to three years, are mainly 
small and medium- sized ones in agriculture, water conservancy, 
forestry and technology-related industries needing relatively 
small investment but promising quick returns. 
  The projects underway are two bridges, two reservoirs, two 
power stations and two power transmission lines. 
  A local official said that Tibet plans to start a total of 
58 
construction projects with an annual investment of 167.5 million 
yuan this year as part of the three-rivers comprehensive 
development program. 
  According to him, the central and regional governments will 
invest 2.1 billion yuan in the ten-year program, which is 
expected to boost the total industrial and agricultural output 
value of the valleys from 840 million yuan in 1990 to 1.724 
billion yuan in the year 2000.

  [Text] Over the past eight years and more, the Lhasa 
Customs Office has conscientiously carried out the guiding 
spirit of the national meeting on cracking down on smuggling 
and, in the light of realities in our region, launched an 
antismuggling campaign. As a result, it has scored marked 
achievements and made contributions in safeguarding the reform, 
opening up, and economic development in our region. 
  In accordance with the statistics, since 1985, the Lhasa 
Customs Office has achieved the following results: It has 
handled 4,300 smuggling cases, involving 106 kilograms of gold, 
4,450 pieces of cultural relics, 2.4 kg of opium, and 900 grams 
of heroin. At one of its surveillance zones, 122 kg of 
marijuana was once ferreted out, the largest crack down in the 
country. A total of 3,660 pelts of rare and endangered animals; 
900 cheetah pelts; 205 kg of rare and valuable Chinese 
medicines, such as Chinese caterpillar fungus and musk; and 
1,770 pieces of leopard and tiger bones, with a value of 29 
million yuan, have been ferreted out. In addition, a large 
batch of reactionary printing materials, 14,000 pieces of audio- 
video products, and 26,000 pieces of pornographic products have 
been tracked down. The office has contributed to removing 
spiritual pollution. 
  In their struggles against smuggling, the anticontraband 
personnel of the Lhasa Customs Office, under the leadership of 
the party organization of the customs office and with help from 
public security organs, have made arduous efforts that require 
both wisdom and bravery. They have written glorious chapters of 
cracking down on smuggling in the borders of this snowy land. 
The Lhasa Customs Office Investigation Department has twice 
been given glorious titles of National Advanced Customs Office 
Collective and National Advanced Anticontraband Collective.

  [Excerpts] The discipline inspection and supervisory organs 
at all levels throughout the province have deeply investigated 
and handled the cases of violations of the law and discipline as 
well as have cleared up the way and removed the obstacle for 
developing the market economy by earnestly implementing the 
arrangements made the CPC Central Committee and the provincial 
party committee; closely following the party's central work; and 
abiding by the whole situation of serving the programs of 
reform, development, and stability. 
  Since the second session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection 
Commission, the provincial discipline inspection commission and 
the provincial supervisory department have earnestly 
investigated and handled a large number of violation cases 
committed by party members and cadres through the efforts to 
enhance their leadership, to reinforce the dynamics in work, to 
put the investigation and handling of violation cases on a 
prominent position, to define the focal points of investigation, 
and to stress the practical effect of handling the cases. 
According to statistics, the discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs at all levels throughout the province have 
registered, investigated, and handled 3,554 violation cases 
committed by party members and cadres, in which 2,616 party 
members and cadres were punished. Of these party members and 
cadres, 40 are of the units at the county-section level. Only 
in the period from January to April this year, the discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs at all levels across the 
province investigated and handled 1,519 violation cases 
committed by party members and cadres. Of these cases, 148 are 
of serious and appalling crimes and account for 9.74 percent in 
the total of registered cases, in which 667 party members and 
cadres were punished and 14 are of the units at or above the 
county-section level. 
  In deeply carrying out the struggle against corruption, the 
provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial 
supervisory department have led the work teams on many occasions 
to go deep into grass-roots levels to carry out investigation 
and study and to conduct face-to-face guidance over the work of 
handling cases. They have held meetings periodically to 
allocate cases to relevant departments, to arrange the clues of 
cases in order of investigations, and to conduct specific 
discussion and arrangements for the investigation and handling 
of key cases. Meanwhile, they have enhanced the coordination 
with the departments in charge of enforcing the law and 
discipline and made efforts to foster the joint force of 
struggle against corruption, thus, bringing about a steady 
increase in the number of serious and appalling cases that have 
been well investigated and handled. [passage omitted] 
  In the first four months this year, the discipline 
inspection 
and supervisory organs at all levels across the province made a 
new breakthrough in investigating and handling the serious and 
appalling cases, of which 54 were handed over to the judicial 
organs, 7.265 million yuan of economic losses were directly 
recovered for the state and collectives. 
  While deeply investigating and handling the cases of 
violating the law and discipline, the discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs at all levels across the province have also 
paid attention to summarizing the experience gained in 
investigating the cases, analyzing the typical cases, studying 
the law and characteristics of violations committed by party 
members and cadres, publicizing promptly the typical deeds of 
administrative honesty and diligence, and conducting positive 
and negative education among the broad masses of party members 
and cadres. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Li Junsheng (2621 0193 3932): "Concentrate Forces on </F>
Investigation and Handling of Major and Serious Cases"] 
  [Text] From the beginning of this year, Hebei's discipline 
inspection and supervision organs at all levels, with a firm 
hold always, have taken the investigation and punishment of 
party members and cadres who violated law and discipline as an 
important measure of the anticorruption struggle. Leaders at 
all levels were responsible for their assigned cases, personally 
commanded the cases at the forefront, and focused forces on 
major and serious cases. From January to April, the discipline 
inspection and supervision organs in the whole province accepted 
and handled 33,125 cases reported by the masses in their letters 
and visits. They investigated and handled 3,429 cases on party 
members and cadres who violated law and discipline, of which 
1,790 cases were already concluded. A total of 1,775 people 
were dealt with according to party and political disciplinary 
actions, and 85 people were subjected to criminal sanctions. 
  Compared with last year, this year's investigation work had 
four distinguishing features. 
  First, the numbers of the cases investigated and handled and 
the discipline violators who were punished were large and showed 
a large-scale increase. In this year's first four months, the 
number of the cases investigated and handled rose by 71.36 
percent over the same period of the previous year; and the 
numbers of the people who were dealt with according to party 
disciplinary actions, political disciplinary actions, and 
criminal law were respectively 54.82 percent, 201.39 percent, 
and 63.46 percent higher than the same period of the previous 
year. The numbers of investigated and handled cases increased 
by 1.31 times and 1.27 times over the same period of last year 
in Handan city and Hengshui Prefecture, respectively. 
  Second, a batch of major and serious cases were investigated 
and handled. From January to April, there were a total of 187 
major and serious cases investigated and handled across the 
province, an increase of 32.62 percent over the same period of 
the previous year. Of the total, 75 cases involved leading 
cadres at and above the deputy county head level, an increase of 
368.73 percent over the same period of the previous year. 
  Third, there is a large proportion of cases on violation of 
economic discipline in the total investigated and handled cases. 
Discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels, 
focusing on economic construction, the central task, stressed 
the investigation and handling of economic discipline breaches 
to protect the smooth development of reform and opening up. 
From January to April, they investigated and handled 1,681 
economic cases, 49.02 percent of the total cases registered and 
an increase of 41.4 percent over the same period of the previous 
year, and recovered an economic loss of 399.45 million yuan for 
the country. Recently, an extraordinary big case about bribery 
during the contracting of construction projects was uncovered in 
Handan city. Thirty-nine people were involved, the amount of 
money violating law and discipline reached over 400,000 yuan, 
and six cadres at the county level and four scientific and 
technical cadres were arrested according to law. The discipline 
inspection commission and procuratorate in Wuan city uncovered 
an extraordinary big bribe- taking case in the city's industrial 
and commercial bank and credit cooperative, and of the 17 people 
involved in the case, six cadres at and above the deputy section 
chief level took bribes totaling 512,000 yuan. 
  Fourth, a batch of major and serious cases committed by 
groups and regional cases were cracked. Most of such cases 
involved many people each, and many of them were characterized 
by people in and outside a department or at higher and lower 
levels collaborating with each other and were complicated and 
difficult to deal with. Discipline inspection and supervision 
organs closely coordinated with law-enforcement organizations 
and commanded in unison to make breakthroughs in major cases. 
The provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision 
department alone investigated and handled four such cases. All 
cities and prefectures also made breakthroughs in a batch of 
major and serious cases. For example, Zhang Liejun, former 
general manager; and Yang Kuizhong, Wang Xihuan, and Lee 
Zhiqiang, deputy general managers of a general company in 
Qinhuangdao city economic and technological development zone, 
practiced fraud and issued forged receipts to draw 15,505.80 
yuan in cash through a certain company and bank and shared 1,000 
yuan each. They also used their subordinating company's money 
earned from selling old electric wires to pay for their personal 
contract deposits, 1,000 yuan for each. Besides, Zhang, Yang, 
and Wang also accepted 2,000 yuan in bribes each. Now Zhang 
Liejun, Yang Kuizhong, and Wang Xihuan have been expelled from 
the party and dismissed from their positions as general manager 
and deputy general manager. At the same time, the judicial 
organ also investigated their crimes of embezzlement and 
accepting bribes. Li Zhiqiang was placed on probation within 
the party for two years and dismissed from the administrative 
post as deputy general manager as punishment.

3189): "The Hebei Provincial CPC Committee and Government 
Cosponsor the Provincial Meeting on Industrial Economic Reform 
and Development"] 
  [Text] The provincial meeting on industrial economic reform 
and development was held in Shijiazhuang on 11 June. The main 
tasks of the meeting are to study and arrange the work of 
deepening the enterprise reform, readjusting the product mix, 
promoting technological progress, strengthening the setup of the 
entrepreneur contingent, and ensuring the realization of the 
targets of "registering increases in three aspects and a 
decrease in one aspect and making improvement in one aspect"; to 
study and resolve the deep-layered contradictions and problems 
of fundamental and far-reaching nature in the industrial 
economic operation; and to discuss and revise several important 
documents on accelerating the province's industrial economic 
reform and development. This was an important meeting 
cosponsored by the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government. 
  The meeting was chaired by Chen Liyou, executive vice 
governor of the provincial government. Cheng Weigao, secretary 
of the provincial party committee and governor of the provincial 
government, made speeches at the meeting. Guo Shichang, vice 
governor of the provincial government, made arrangements for the 
acceleration of the province's industrial economic reform and 
development and for the current industrial production. 
Provincial leaders Chen Yujie, Zhang Zhenhuai, Yu Zhenzhong, 
and Song Shuhua were present at the meeting. Present at the 
meeting were mayors, prefectural commissioners, vice mayors and 
deputy commissioners in charge of industrial work, city and 
prefectural organizational department directors, city and 
prefectural planning committee chairmen, city and prefectural 
economic and trade committee chairmen, and city and prefectural 
restructural commission chairmen, responsible comrades of the 
provincial-level departments concerned, and plant directors and 
managers of 50 key enterprises. 
  Since the beginning of this year, our province has 
maintained 
an appropriate industrial economic growth trend based on the 
rapid development in 1993. The general situation has been good 
but, affected by the malpractice of the planned economic system 
accumulated for several years, many new situations in industrial 
economic reform and development have emerged in the province. 
Simultaneously, some prominent contradictions and problems still 
exist in the industrial economic operation. The industrial 
production growth rate has slowed down. The industrial 
enterprises' economic results are not ideal enough, and their 
products do not have a ready market. The amounts of products 
kept in stock have increased. The capital utilization rate is 
low. Due to the insufficient input of floating funds, 
enterprises are extremely short of capital so that the 
production development has been affected. Enterprises' 
production cost and deficits have increased. In particular, 
money-losing state-owned enterprises account for a large 
proportion. The investment in fixed assets has dropped by a big 
margin. Particularly, the localities seriously lag behind in 
terms of technological transformation. 
  After analyzing the industrial economic situation in the 
first five months of the year, Cheng Weigao said: The slow pace 
of structural readjustment, the stagnation in mechanism reforms, 
and enterprise managers' shortage of motivation and pressure are 
the essential reasons for the province's slow industrial growth 
rate and low industrial quality. Fundamentally speaking, such a 
situation resulted from the facts that the leaders at various 
levels have paid more attention to the input to fixed assets and 
the increase in new production capacity but failed to shift the 
focus of the work on deepening reform, changing mechanisms, 
readjusting structures, and improving efficiency. The leaders 
at various levels should conscientiously think a lot about this 
and further straighten out their work ideologies. We must no 
longer pay attention to capital construction to the neglect of 
technological transformation, to the increase in input to the 
neglect of sciences and technologies, and to short-term 
interests to the neglect of long-term ones alone. We should be 
determined and adopt powerful measures to accelerate the reform 
of the enterprise managerial mechanisms, accelerate the pace of 
structural readjustment, promote enterprises' technological 
progress, promote the contacts between domestic and foreign 
markets, and ensure a ceaseless increase in enterprises' 
economic results. 
  How can we promote industrial production? Cheng Weigao said: 
The key to promoting industrial production hinges on grasping 
good products, setting up good mechanisms, and selecting good 
plant directors. Good products are the essential conditions for 
enterprises' existence, good mechanisms are the sources of 
enterprises' vitality, and good plant directors are the soul of 
enterprises. Grasping good products means grasping projects 
with powerful competition, producing famous brands, creating 
products with competitiveness, and striving to produce 
first-class products. By so doing Hebei will be able to have a 
large number of famous-brand products occupy domestic and 
foreign markets. By improving mechanism, we mean making 
enterprises have full authority for management, assume full 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, and develop and 
regulate themselves. By successfully choosing plant directors, 
we mean boldly reforming the existing personnel system of 
enterprises to train and bring up a large number of modern 
entrepreneurs in line with the principle of making the party 
manage cadres and with the demand of the market economic system. 
  On training and bringing up a mighty contingent of 
entrepreneurs, Cheng Weigao said that entrepreneurs constitute a 
decisive factor for the existence and development of enterprises 
amid market competition and are the representatives of advanced 
productive forces. The prosperity or decline of enterprises 
depends to a large extent on entrepreneurs. Thus, training and 
bringing up a mighty contingent of entrepreneurs constitutes an 
urgent task for accelerating the province's industrial and 
economic development and for improving the province's industrial 
and economic quality. 
  What are entrepreneurs? Socialist modern professional 
entrepreneurs working for state-owned enterprises should at 
least have the following qualifications: First, they should 
have the virtue entitled to socialist entrepreneurs. That is, 
they should firmly follow the path of building the socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, persist in the purpose of 
depending on workers, staff, and the masses to run enterprises, 
be honest and impartial in performing official duties, abide by 
discipline and laws, pay attention to reputation, and refuse to 
pursue money worship and infringe upon the interests of 
customers. Second, they should have the courage, that is 
entitled to entrepreneurs, of being brave in competing with 
others, making innovations, running risks, and pioneering the 
road of advance. Third, they should have the knowledge entitled 
to entrepreneurs. That is, they should be familiar with the 
market situation, understand the persons of the same trades, 
understand the law of the economy and the practice of the 
international trade, and understand how to operate and manage 
enterprises. Fourth, they should have the ability entitled to 
entrepreneurs. That is, they should be able to make scientific 
policy decisions and to meet an emergency, be good at 
management, know their subordinates well enough to assign them 
jobs commensurate with their abilities, and be able to lead 
their enterprises develop continuously. Fifth, they should 
shoulder the duties, that are entitled to entrepreneurs, of 
ensuring the constant increase in the value of state-owned 
assets, the constant improvement in economic efficiency and 
labor productivity, and the continuous increase in income of 
enterprise workers and staff. All localities should rapidly 
establish the mechanisms of giving incentive and restriction to 
plant directors and managers and resolve the problem of there 
being no differences between good and bad performers. In line 
with the characteristics of market economy, all localities 
should make bold explorations for reforming the system on 
management of enterprise cadres. Various units at various 
levels should support enterprise leaders to exercise powers, 
shoulder duties, and run risks. Press and propaganda 
departments should give a wide publicity to the advanced and 
exemplary deeds of enterprise managers and dealers and should 
use correct public opinions to guide and help the people 
understand the position and role played by entrepreneurs in 
carrying out the modernization drive and overcome all kinds of 
prejudice against enterprise managers with a view to forming a 
fine practice of respecting, supporting, and cherishing 
entrepreneurs. 
  Ye Liansong dwelt on some important opinions on the 
province's industrial reform and development. He said: To 
fulfill the goal of building Hebei into an economically strong 
province, we must pay attention to the following several tasks, 
viewing from the long-term interest and from the endeavor of 
resolving immediate difficulties: 
  We should further deepen enterprise reform with focus on 
transforming mechanisms and establishing new systems. The focus 
of enterprise reform must be shifted from reducing taxes for and 
conceding profits to enterprises and readjusting policies in the 
past several years to transforming mechanisms and establishing 
new systems. With the clarifying of the relations of property 
rights, the strengthening of the incentive mechanism, and the 
perfecting of the restriction mechanism as the key contents, all 
localities and all departments should make overall planning and 
arrangements by proceeding from realities, should give different 
guidances based on different situations, and should formulate 
specific programs for transforming mechanisms and establishing 
systems for respective enterprises in line with their respective 
conditions. Through the ways of establishing modern enterprise 
system, reforming the corporate system, accelerating 
technological progress, and developing enterprise groups, we 
should help the large and medium-sized key enterprises with good 
economic efficiency, great competitiveness, and great potential 
of development to enhance their scale, grades, efficiency, and 
competitiveness. The small-sized enterprises with small 
amounts of profits or with deficits should closely combine the 
enlivening of themselves with the enlivening of their assets. 
By adopting the forms of contract, leasing, state ownership and 
civilian management, management on a commissioned basis, 
shareholding cooperation, property right reorganization, and 
estate transfer, the small-sized enterprises should promote the 
vitality of the whole and the part and make appropriate use of 
their existing assets. 
  We should accelerate the pace of structural readjustment and 
promote the updating and upgrading of products. Markets should 
be taken as an orientation for readjusting the product mix. 
This is conducive to giving full scope to the strong points, 
avoiding weaknesses, and bringing their functions into full 
play. According to the basic ideology of "high-efficient heavy 
industry and intensive and precision light industry" and the 
"high, quality, large-scale, and export-oriented" orientation, 
we should unswervingly grasp structural readjustment. We should 
comprehensively implement the "dragon and tiger" plan and the 
plan for development by six groups to readjust the product mix 
of large and medium-sized key enterprises. We should vigorously 
cultivate and develop new high-tech industrial development zones 
and new high-tech industrial park zones to promote the rapid 
development of new industries. According to the spirit of 
"emulating rich and famous families, grasping projects with 
strong points, creating famous brands, and striving to be the 
first class," we should grasp the production of famous-brand 
products of strategic nature and with vast prospects. In the 
forms of amalgamation, bankruptcy, capital cooperation, 
stripping, and reorganization, the enterprises whose products 
are not readily marketable, that suffer serious losses, and that 
are hopeless in halting deficits should transfer their existing 
assets to the industries and enterprises with high efficiency. 
According to the industrial policies, we should accelerate the 
formulation of the provincial program for readjusting the 
industrial product mix and effectively guide enterprises to 
accelerate the updating and upgrading of products according to 
the macroeconomic goal. 
  State-owned industrial enterprises, particularly large and 
medium-sized enterprises, should exert efforts to grasp the 
input in technological transformation. First, state-owned 
industrial enterprises, particularly large and medium-sized 
enterprises, should concentrate the input on technological 
transformation. Second, enterprises should emphatically grasp 
the development of new products, and the setup of advanced and 
high-efficient enterprises should be grasped. The governments 
at various levels and all financial departments should pay firm 
attention to collecting funds to ensure the supply of funds for 
promoting technological progress and to increase the returns on 
use of capital. To promote the development of new products, 
scientific research units, universities, and colleges are 
allowed to convert the products that they have manufactured into 
stocks, sell them to enterprises in the name of units or 
individuals, and then draw extra dividends according to the 
number of stocks. All large and medium-sized enterprises should 
set up technological development organizations. Simultaneously, 
the existing technological development organizations under 
enterprises should bring their functions into better play. 
  Alleviating enterprises' strain on working funds should be 
regarded as a task of the most urgent importance and be firmly 
attended to. We should make good and full use of loans and 
strive to expand the scale of loans. We should fully support 
the enterprises whose products are readily marketable and of 
good efficiency, that are able to create foreign exchange 
through exports, and whose loans can be withdrawn; and grant 
loans to them for use as working funds. Loans should also be 
granted to the enterprises that suffer losses but are hopeful to 
halt losses and whose products are readily marketable and of 
good efficiency. We should organize forces to clear up the debt 
chains between enterprises, intensify sales, reduce the amounts 
of products kept in stock, enliven the existing capital, and 
upgrade the returns on use of capital. All banks should 
cooperate with economic and trade committees, try every possible 
means to enliven the existing loans, and tap the potential for 
use of existing capital. 
  We should realistically grasp the current industrial 
production. First, we should expand the production of readily 
marketable products. Second, we should exert efforts to pioneer 
markets and intensify sales. Third, we should realistically 
grasp production management and strive to alleviate the 
restrictions by bottlenecks. Fourth, we should continue to 
launch the "grasping, helping, and halting" campaign.

Administrative and Institutional Units

institutional units includes administrative fees and 
institutional charges that are not included in the state budget, 
as well as the various types of foundations (funds) received or 
retained in accordance with the relevant state and provincial 
regulations by state organs, mass organizations, and 
whole-people ownership institutional units. 
  Article 13 -- Administrative and institutional fees and 
charges should be based on laws, rules, and regulations. The 
specific charges and fees, including their range and levels, 
should be reported and approved in accordance with the following 
stipulations: 
  1) The administrative and institutional charges established 
by the various departments of the provincial people's government 
shall be examined and approved jointly by the provincial 
financial department and the provincial pricing department. The 
formulation and readjustment of the range or level of the 
charges will be jointly examined and approved by the provincial 
pricing department and the financial department. Major charges 
and the levels of these charges will, after being jointly 
examined and verified by the provincial financial and pricing 
departments, be reported to the provincial people's government 
for approval. 
  2) Prefectures, cities, counties (districts) and townships 
(small towns) are not permitted, on their own accord, to 
establish local or regional charges. In cases where it is 
necessary to establish such charges, after the proposals have 
been jointly examined and verified by the provincial financial 
and pricing departments, they will be reported to the provincial 
people's government for approval. 
  In respect of those administrative and institutional charges 
which have been approved in accordance with the stipulated 
procedures, the charges, their range, and their levels shall be 
publicly announced. 
  Article 14 -- A licensing system will be implemented for 
administrative and institutional charges. The departments and 
units levying the charges should take the approval documents to 
the specified pricing department to obtain their charge-levying 
licenses. 
  In the levying of administrative and institutional charges, 
unified receipts which have been printed by or printed under the 
supervision of a financial department must be used. The 
charges, their range and their level must be in accordance with 
what has been stipulated or approved. 
  Charges that are levied without charge-levying licenses or 
without unified receipts printed by or printed under the 
supervision of a financial department will be considered illegal 
levies, and units or individuals that are subject to the charges 
have the right to refuse to pay. In response to illegal levies, 
any unit or person has the right to make a report to the 
financial and pricing departments. 
  Article 15 -- Under conditions where ownership rights and 
use 
rights do not change, the extra-budgetary funds of 
administrative and institutional units shall be managed through 
deposit in special financial administration accounts. 
  The extra-budgetary funds of administrative and 
institutional 
units will be managed by each unit by opening income and 
expenditure accounts in a bank and managing income and 
expenditure separately. 
  Apart from where the state has other applicable 
stipulations, 
administrative and institutional units may only open accounts in 
one bank. 
  The extra-budgetary funds deposited in special financial 
administration accounts will be paid interest in accordance with 
state stipulations, and the interest will be credited to the 
unit's account. 
  All units should make quarterly reports on their plans for 
using such funds and, after examination and approval by the 
financial department at the same level, they can use the funds 
under the supervision of the bank in which they have opened 
their accounts. When there is a need to utilize funds in special 
circumstances, approval can be granted immediately following the 
report. Without the examination and approval of the finance 
department, the banks in which the accounts have been opened are 
not permitted to pay out funds which have been deposited in 
special financial administration accounts. 
  Financial departments at all levels should simplify their 
examination and approval procedures. When it is appropriate for 
units which have special deposits to use their own funds, the 
financial departments must guarantee that they will not shift 
responsibility, delay things or adversely affect the use of 
funds by those units holding special accounts. The banks in 
which the accounts are held should, when expenditure permission 
is granted by the finance departments, pay out the funds in a 
timely way and must not use excuses to hold up payments. 
  Article 16 -- Financial departments at all levels, on the 
precondition of guaranteeing normal funds use by units with 
special accounts, may use funds between special financial 
administration accounts and adjust funds so that surpluses in 
one place can be used to meet deficiencies in other places, so 
that production and institutional development can be supported. 
However, they must not use such funds to establish banking 
organs, development companies or for capital construction 
investment. 
  Article 17 -- The extra-budgetary funds of administrative 
and 
institutional units must be used in accordance with stipulated 
avenues. In accordance with a state-stipulated range, a portion 
can be used to supplement administrative and institutional 
charges, while the balance must be used in accordance with state 
regulations. 
  Specialized foundations (funds) must be earmarked for 
specified purposes and must not be diverted for other uses. 
  Article 18 -- Administrative and institutional units 
intending to use extra-budgetary funds for their own capital 
construction must have their proposed projects examined by the 
financial department and must deposit the funds in a special 
extra-budgetary fund account of the financial department at the 
same level in the Construction Bank. If approval has not been 
obtained, funds cannot be assigned to capital construction 
plans, and the Construction Bank must not transfer funds, 
  Article 19 -- When administrative and institutional units 
intend to use extra-budgetary funds to purchase controlled 
commodities, the relevant examination and approval procedures 
must be followed. 
  Article 20 -- When administrative and institutional units 
intend to use extra-budgetary funds to pay wages, award bonuses, 
provide subsidies and allowances, or cover welfare costs, it 
must be done strictly in accordance with the relevant state and 
provincial stipulations. 
  Article 21 -- The extra-budgetary funds of all units must be 
managed in a unified way by the financial organ of that unit.

province. Without obtaining approval, no additional charges can 
be added, the range may not be expanded, and the level cannot be 
raised. 
  Article 24 -- The extra-budgetary funds of financial 
departments shall be used strictly in accordance with the use 
arrangements stipulated by the state and the province. Funds 
must not be diverted for other purposes. 
  Article 25 -- When the extra-budgetary funds of financial 
departments are to be used for capital construction, the plans 
must be reported and approved in accordance with the stipulated 
procedures and included in the capital construction plans. 
<H5>  Chapter 4 -- The Management of Funds Retained by State-Owned </H5>

  Article 26 -- The use of funds retained by state-owned 
enterprises will be decided by the enterprises themselves in 
accordance with the "Law Governing Industrial Enterprises Owned
