Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social Development in 
1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the provincial 
party committee and government, the people of various 
nationalities across the province made further efforts to put 
into effect the guidelines from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important remarks made during his inspection tour of South China 
and from the 14th National Party Congress; seized the 
opportunity; deepened reform; and accelerated development while 
closely centering around the objective of establishing a new 
socialist market economic structure. Moreover, in light of the 
conspicuous contradictions which emerged in the macroeconomic 
operation and the actual conditions of the province, they 
carried out the central policies and measures for intensifying 
macroeconomic regulation and control and attained positive 
results. In the course of readjusting the industrial and 
economic structures, new developments were made in the tertiary 
industry, township and town enterprises, nonpublic economic 
sectors, and so on, and some new economic growth points began to 
take shape. The national economy of the entire province 
advanced through in-depth reform and a sustained and faster 
growth was scored as difficulties were overcome. According to 
preliminary statistics, the GNP in the year reached 37.4 billion 
yuan, up 9.1 percent over the previous year, and the rapid 
growth, as judged by international standards, has lasted for 
three consecutive years. Of the total values increased, those 
of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries registered 13.1, 
14, and 10.3 billion yuan, up 4.1, 10, and 15 percent 
respectively. If their proportion in the year's GNP were 
compared with 1992, that of the primary industry fell from 36.5 
to 35 percent, that of the secondary industry rose from 37 to 
37.4 percent, and that of the tertiary industry rose from 26.5 
to 27.6 percent. 
  Along with the national economic development, considerable 
headway was also made in various social undertakings throughout 
the province. The scientific and technological undertakings 
made new strides in transforming their research results into 
productive forces; in the educational undertakings, serious 
attention was paid to the readjustment of courses offered in 
various schools to train qualified personnel for the market 
economy; in sports undertakings, a new breakthrough was made in 
the level of competition; and corresponding development was also 
attained in various undertakings including culture, public 
health, insurance, environmental protection, and so on. 
  In 1993, urban and rural in-depth reform was coordinated 
with 
economic and social development and reform in many areas was 
notably expedited. This was manifested in the following 
aspects: 1) with regard to rural reform, under the precondition 
of stabilizing and perfecting the contract responsibility system 
on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and the 
two-tier management system under which unified management is 
combined with separate management, relevant provincial units 
conscientiously reorganized those agriculture-related economic 
and technical departments into economic entities, further 
established and amplified the agricultural socialized service 
system, and made giant strides in practicing the joint-stock 
system in township and town enterprises and building township 
and town industrial districts. 2) with regard to enterprise 
reform, the work was focused on the transformation of 
operational mechanisms and, through clarifying and straightening 
out the relations between ownership and management, enterprises 
accelerated their process of changing traditional operational 
mechanisms and instituting a modern enterprise system. By the 
end of 1993, 20 enterprises were approved to form joint-stock 
limited companies and more than 160 enterprises were approved to 
form limited liability companies, with the stocks of two such 
companies successfully listed on stock markets. In addition, 
noticeable progress was also made by the province's commercial 
enterprises in the transformation of operational mechanisms. 
Some 61.7 percent of these enterprises lifted controls over 
operation, pricing, employment, and distribution, and 22.6 
percent of state-owned commercial and supply and marketing 
cooperatives tried to practice a "state-owned, community-run" 
system or had their original enterprises transformed into 
joint-stock companies. 3) With regard to price reform, new 
advances were made in comprehensively relaxing control over 
prices and operation in purchasing and marketing grain and 
edible oil and the prices of some basic products and service 
charges of some basic industries were readjusted and raised. 
Commodity prices regulated by the market grew in number, with 95 
percent of consumer goods and 85 percent of the means of 
production now regulated by the market, thus gradually 
establishing a mechanism whereby prices are mainly fixed by the 
market. 4) Over 300 scientific research institutes were 
transformed into scientific and technological entities, or 
scientific research units run by the local people. 5) New 
progress was also scored in reform in other fields including the 
housing and social insurance systems, sales of land use rights, 
organizational reform, and so on. 
  The prominent problems the province's economic development 
experienced in 1993 were: The difference between social supply 
and demand slightly exceeded reasonable limits and the 
difficulty in maintaining a balance between total supply and 
total demand increased; the contradictions between 
transportation and economic growth were conspicuous, energy was 
in short supply, and the "bottleneck" constraints were 
aggravated; the margin of price increases were excessively large 
and, in particular, the margin of increase in rural areas was 
larger than in cities which, to a certain extent, affected and 
restrained the further enhancement of living standards of rural 
residents and some urban residents; in the organizational and 
operational modes of agricultural production, the application of 
administrative means and management mode in the small-scale 
peasant economy were still relatively prominent and there was 
still no mechanism to lead peasants into the market; and the 
shortage of funds and the performance of enterprises still 
constituted two obstacles which hindered economic development. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, the people in various localities across the 
province 
conscientiously put into practice the policies of the party's 
Central Committee and the State Council on intensifying 
agriculture and maintaining steady agricultural development, 
taking firm control of the comprehensive management in 
agriculture, making efforts to invigorate agriculture through 
the application of scientific and technological advances, and 
positively improving the conditions of production to ensure the 
steady growth of agricultural production. The value added to 
farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery in 1993 totaled 
13.1 billion yuan, an increase of 4.1 percent, and their total 
output value came to 20.14 billion yuan, up 4.2 percent. Of this 
total, farming accounted for 12.62 billion yuan, up 5.9 percent; 
forestry for 1.185 billion yuan, down 9.9 percent; animal 
husbandry for 6.233 billion yuan, up 3.9 percent; and fishery 
for 102 million yuan, a relatively big increase. 
  In the production of major agricultural products, there was 
a 
bumper harvest in grain in 1993, another year of record highs 
second only to 1991, the output of cured tobacco hit an all-time 
high but that of rapeseed decreased substantially. The 
province's total grain output for the year was 8.695 million 
tonnes, an increase of 806,000 tonnes or 10.2 percent, only 1.8 
percent less than 1991, which witnessed the record yield of 
8.855 million tonne. Of this total, summer grain accounted for 
1.695 million tonne and autumn grain 7 million tonnes, 
increases of 21,000 and 785,000 tonnes or 1.3 and 12.6 percent 
respectively. The year's total output of cured tobacco came to 
497,000 tonnes, an increase of 48,000 tonne or 10.6 percent and 
that of rapeseed totalled 386,000 tonne, down 22.8 percent.

  New progress was made in afforestation. In 1993, an area of 
287,000 hectares (4.305 million mu) was afforested, an increase 
of 19,000 hectares (285,000 mu) or 7 percent. Of this, manmade 
afforestation covered an area of 242,000 hectares, up 9.2 
percent. There were increases and decreases of output in major 
forest products. The increases included raw lacquer, tallow 
seeds, gall nuts, pine nuts, bamboo shoots, and chestnuts, with 
the output of chestnuts increasing by 16 percent. The decreases 
included tung tree nuts, tea oil camellia nuts, palm chips [zong 
pian 2762 3651], and walnuts, with the former two items 
decreasing by 5.8 and 20.7 percent respectively. 
  A sustained development momentum reappeared in animal 
husbandry. In 1993, the total output of meat across the province 
was 889,000 tonne, up 3.9 percent. Of this total, that of pork, 
beef, and mutton reached 847,000 tonne, 3.6 percent more than in 
1992. The share of animal husbandry in the total output value 
of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery was 31 
percent, an increase of 3.5 percentage points.

  The margin of increase in fishery was larger in 1993 than 
in 1992. The total catch of aquatic products reached 25,549 
tonne, an increase of 1,942 tonne or 8.2 percent and its margin 
of increase was 5.1 percentage points higher. 
  The technical level of agricultural production was enhanced 
to some extent and the scale of agricultural machinery 
allocation was expanded. In 1993, the proportion held by the 
improved varieties of hybrid rice and maize in the areas sown to 
these crops rose to 68 percent from 62.7 percent. The area of 
cultivation using practical agricultural techniques, including 
cultivating rice seedlings in two stages, standardized 
cultivation of paddy rice, rotation of crops on dry land, 
dissemination of growing maize on a tight schedule [jin cou xing 
4868 0410 0992], and so on increased somewhat. By the end of 
1993, the aggregate power of the province's farm machinery 
reached 3.514 million kw, up 11.6 percent. Of this, irrigation 
and drainage equipment had a total power capacity of 466,000 kw 
and processing equipment for agricultural products had a 
capacity of 1.386 million kw, up 18.6 and 9.6 percent 
respectively. There were 34,700 small tractors and rototillers, 
8,591 farm-related trucks, 721 spraying machines, and 52,400 
pumps for agricultural use. There were also 1,004 hydropower 
stations run by townships and villages across the province and 
the power generation in rural areas for the year was 536 million 
kwh. The application of chemical fertilizers (with 100 percent 
effective content equivalent) and pesticides reached 582,700 and 
7,800 tonne respectively. 
  Township and town enterprises entered a new development 
period with their total output value and business turnover 
breaking through the barrier of 10 billion yuan. According to 
the statistics of the Township and Town Enterprise Bureau, the 
total output value of the province's township and town 
enterprises amounted to 12.283 billion yuan (at 1990 constant 
prices), a growth of 40 percent and the business turnover for 
the year came to 13.016 billion yuan, a growth of 53 percent. 
<H5>  II. Industry and the Construction Industry </H5>
  Taking transformation of operational mechanisms, 
readjustment 
of product mix, and enhancement of economic results as focal 
points, the province's industrial enterprises made efforts to 
incrementally adapt themselves to the objective requirements of 
establishing a socialist market economy in various ways, at 
different levels, and through multiple channels in 1993. While 
overcoming difficulties and contradictions, such as shortage of 
funds, energy, and transportation capacity, as well as rapid 
changes in commodity markets, they maintained steady growth in 
industrial production. The total industrial output value 
registered 38.247 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent. Of this total, 
that at and above the township level came to 32.472 billion yuan 
and the added value was 10.739 billion yuan, up 8.8 and 7.2 
percent respectively. 
  As viewed from the types of industry, heavy industry showed 
a 
good momentum while light industry declined. In 1993, the total 
output value of heavy industry at and above the township level 
amounted to 22.323 billion yuan and its added value came to 
6.659 billion yuan, up 16.4 and 14.1 percent respectively. The 
total output value of light industry at and above the township 
level amounted to 10.149 billion yuan and the added value 
totalled 4.08 billion yuan, down 4.2 and 5.3 percent 
respectively. 
  As viewed from different economic sectors, nonpublic 
industry 
grew rapidly, while state-owned industry grew slowly. In 1993, 
of the total industrial output value at the township level and 
above, that of collective industry amounted to 4.611 billion 
yuan and that of other economic sectors amounted to 621 million 
yuan, up 21.4 and 10.5 percent respectively. However, the 
output value of state-owned industry totalled 27.241 billion 
yuan, increasing by only 6.5 percent, and its growth rate was 
14.9 and 4 percentage points lower than the collective and other 
economic sectors during the corresponding period. 
  Large and medium industrial enterprises continued to 
maintain 
their backbone position. In 1993, the total output value 
realized by large and medium-sized enterprises registered 21.902 
billion yuan, their added value amounted to 8.194 billion yuan, 
and their sales value totalled 21.049 billion yuan, accounting 
for 67.4, 76.3, and 68.3 percent respectively of the targets 
among industrial enterprises of similar size at the township 
level and above. The rate of production and marketing of large 
and medium enterprises was 96.1 percent, 2.8 percentage points 
higher than that of industrial enterprises. 
  The economic results in some industrial enterprises improved 
but the linkage between production and marketing was relatively 
poor. Judging from the industrial enterprises with independent 
accounting the overall labor productivity (in terms of value 
added) rose from 10,467 yuan in 1992 to 12,891 yuan in 1993; the 
profit rate on product sales rose by 0.5 percent; and the cost 
of sales income for 100 yuan was reduced by 6.6 yuan. However, 
the amount of losses reached 731 million yuan, 20.2 percent more 
than in 1992; the turnover of circulating capital slowed down by 
0.1 times to register only 1.25 times; the profit and tax rate 
on capital fell to 12.1 percent from 13.8 percent in 1992; the 
rate of industrial added value dropped from 38.9 to 37.4 
percent; and the composite index of economic results was 96.6. 
In 1993, the rate of production and marketing of industrial 
enterprises at the township level and above was 93.3 percent, a 
decline of 4.3 percentage points. Hence, the work linking 
production with marketing should be further intensified.

  The building industry strived to develop amid competition 
and 
its overall labor productivity was heightened. Value added by 
the state-owned building industry was 730 million yuan, an 
actual increase of 3.8 percent after allowing for price rises. 
Of this, value added by the building industry belonging to the 
central and local authorities was 470 and 260 million yuan, 
increases of 7.2 and 3.4 percent respectively. The overall 
labor productivity of this industry calculated with the output 
value of projects under construction rose to 19,502 yuan from 
14,808 yuan in 1992. The output value of projects completed 
during the year was 1.354 billion yuan, up 26.5 percent, and the 
completion rate was 54.6 percent, down 4.1 percentage points. 
The number of contracted operations in the building industry 
increased. In 1993, the contracted responsibility system was 
practiced in 88.7 percent of state-owned construction 
enterprises, up 5.4 percent age points. There were 1,072 
projects involving units undertaking contracts through public 
bidding, an increase of 72 projects and accounting for 29.4 
percent of the projects under the contracted responsibility 
system, showing a slight increase. 
<H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  In 1993, the pace of construction in the province was 
notably 
quickened and investment was expanded by a large margin. 
According to preliminary statistics, the fixed-asset investment 
by the entire society during 1993 amounted to 9.603 billion 
yuan, up 35.4 percent. Of this total, investment accomplished by 
state-owned units amounted to 7.29 billion yuan, 34.5 percent 
up, and its proportion in the fixed-asset investment of the 
entire society reached 75.9 percent. Investment accomplished by 
the collective economic sector and urban and rural individuals 
amounted to 550 million and 1.763 billion yuan respectively. Of 
the total investment by state-owned units, that of capital 
construction came to 4.31 billion yuan and that of technical 
innovation and transformation came to 2.38 billion yuan, up 30.8 
and 33.9 percent respectively. 
  Investment in local projects increased by a larger margin 
with the proportion rising to some extent. Of the fixed-asset 
investment accomplished by state-owned units, that of local 
projects amounted to 4.03 billion yuan, up 36.4 percent and its 
proportion rose from 55.3 to 54.5 percent. Of this, investment 
in capital construction projects and innovation and 
transformation projects by the local authorities amounted to 
2.26 and 1.22 billion yuan, up 44.0 and 13.4 percent 
respectively. Whereas, investment in projects by the central 
authorities reached 3.26 billion yuan, up 32.2 percent. 
  New headway was made in key construction projects. In 1993, 
there were 21 large and medium state-owned capital construction 
projects in the province. Of these, 18 projects were officially 
started, two were being wound up, and one was being prepared. 
Investment in large and medium projects completed during the 
year amounted to 2 billion yuan, which was 97.9 percent of the 
plan and accounted for 46.3 percent of the accomplished 
investment in state-owned capital construction projects. In 
1993, there were 26 technical innovation and transformation 
projects above the norm and investment in these projects 
totalled 530 million yuan, accounting for 22.1 percent of such 
investments made by state-owned units. By the end of 1993, one 
large capital construction project, five single-item projects, 
and two above-norm projects were completed and put into 
operation. 
  Investment in commercial housing increased substantially. In 
1993, investment in commercial housing in the province amounted 
to 384 million yuan, a growth of 190 million yuan, or 96.5 
percent . Of this, investment in residential housing came to 310 
million yuan, a growth of 110 percent. Construction area of 
completed commercial housing totalled 600,000 square meters, of 
which residential premises covered an area of 500,000 square 
meters. Investment in commercial housing accounted for 32.5 
percent of the province's total investment in residential 
premises, which was 7.4 percent higher than in 1992. 
  New changes occurred in the investment structure as more 
investments were made in the energy and tertiary industries. In 
the province's fixed-asset investment made by state-owned units 
during the year, investment in the energy industry totalled 1.77 
billion yuan, an increase of 43 percent and accounting for 38.7 
percent of industrial investment. Of this total, that for the 
power industry increased by 49.4 percent, its share of 
industrial investment rising from 22.9 to 29.3 percent, and that 
for the tertiary industry totalled 2.6 billion yuan, up 92.1 
percent. Of this total, that for transport and post and 
telecommunications amounted to 860 million yuan, 1.2 times 
higher than 1992 and accounting for 32.9 percent of the 
investment in the tertiary industry. Key construction projects 
which were started in turn included the Guiyang-Zunyi Special 
Highway, the Guiyang Eastern Gate Highway, the first phase of 
the Panxiang-Baise Highway between Anlong and Hongjiang, 
Longdongbao Airport, and so on. Investment by state-owned units 
used to renovate and transform old projects to increase 
varieties and raise the quality of products amounted to 660 
million yuan, an increase of 17.4, accounting for 27.7 percent 
of the total investment in project renovation and 
transformation. However, agricultural investment and its 
proportion declined. Investment by state-owned units used in 
farming, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and water 
conservancy totalled 90 million yuan, down 4.8 percent, with its 
proportion dropping to 1.2 percent, down 0.5 of a percentage 
point. 
  There were 1,935 projects of capital construction, 
renovation, and transformation completed and put into operation 
in the province during the year, 1,678 of which were local 
projects. The newly increased fixed assets amounted to 4.15 
billion yuan, up 57.7 percent. The completed housing 
construction area totalled 4.12 million square meters, of which 
the residential area was 1.98 million square meters. The newly 
increased production capacity and project efficiency included 
40,000 tonne of electrolyzed aluminum, 232,000 kw of installed 
generator capacity, 202 km of transmission lines, 40,000 tonne 
of cement, 20,000 tonne of synthetic ammonia, 2,500 tonne of 
plastic and resin copolymer, 300,000 outer tires, 35,000 
automatic urban telephone lines, and 150,000 cubic meters of 
gas. In addition, the Guiyang Huaguoyuan Flyover and the 
Dafang-Nayong Class-two Highway were also completed and opened 
to traffic. 
  The major tough problems confronted by investment in 
construction projects were the considerable shortage of funds 
and the sharp price increases of building materials, which 
affected the progress of some key projects as well as investment 
effectiveness. 
<H5>  IV. Transport, Post and Telecommunications </H5>
  Taking the improvement of transport conditions as a dragon 
head, the province laid firm hold on the construction of 
infrastructural transportation facilities. In 1993, the 
province's total mileage of highways in operation reached 32,100 
km, an increase of 434 km. There were 20,300 km of highways of 
various grades in this total, an increase of 250 km. The rate 
of highways reaching certain grades was 63.1 percent. With 
transport operation as their nucleus, the existing transport 
enterprises tapped the potential for raising efficiency and 
increasing volume to ensure the effective transportation of key 
materials. The total volume of freight transport during the 
year was 160.55 million tonne, up 15.2 percent. The cargo volume 
was 30.091 billion tonne/km and that of passengers was 11.399 
billion person/km, both increasing by 13.4 percent .

  New developments were made in post and telecommunications 
undertakings. In 1993, the overall length of mail routes across 
the province reached 40,500 km, an increase of 3,000 km, and the 
total business transactions amounted to 277 million yuan (at 
1990 constant prices), an increase of 43.8 percent . Of this 
total, there were 71.59 million letters, 4.79 million telegrams, 
22.13 million long-distance calls, and 3,223 long-distance 
telephone lines, increases of 24.7, 8.4, 75.1 and 68.2 percent 
respectively. By the end of 1993, there were 155,100 urban 
telephone lines and 103,500 program-controlled lines, up 45.9 
and 220 percent respectively, and urban telephone subscribers 
totalled 100,900, an increase of 35.4 percent. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  In 1993, there were ample commodities in the markets 
throughout the province, sales grew steadily, and supplies of 
goods remained in a state of basic equilibrium. The total 
volume of social commodities purchased during the year was 26.69 
billion yuan and the volume of commodities in stock at the 
year's end totalled 9.718 billion yuan, up 61.8 percent. The 
total volume of retail sales amounted to 13.119 billion yuan, up 
12.7 percent. Of this, the retail sales volume of consumer 
goods totalled 11.832 billion yuan, up 15.2 percent. 
  Import and export trade grew steadily. In 1993, the 
province's total volume of import and export trade reached $363 
million, an increase of 8.2 percent, with exports of $245 
million and imports of $118 million, up 9.2 and 6.1 percent 
respectively. By the end of 1993, countries and regions having 
trade relations with Guizhou increased to 77. 
  Remarkable achievements were attained in importing foreign 
capital. Some 500 contracts to utilize foreign capital were 
signed, 290 more than in 1992. The contract amount totalled 
$645 million, an increase of 2.4 times. Foreign capital 
actually used in the year amounted to $42.94 million, a 1.2-fold 
increase. Of the foreign capital actually used, fund placement 
was extended to the tertiary industry from the secondary 
industry. The investment rate in secondary industry fell from 
95 to 88.9 percent, while that in the tertiary industry rose 
from 5 to 11.1 percent. 
  The tourist trade maintained a booming momentum. Making full 
use of the unique advantage of tourist resources, the province 
successfully sponsored the "Azalea Flower Festival" and the 
"1993 China Huangguoshu Sightseeing and China International 
Famous Wine Festival," which attracted a large number of 
overseas tourists. In the meantime, serious attention was paid 
to the construction of tourist service facilities to enhance the 
service level. Some 102,500 overseas tourists were received, an 
increase of 34.3 percent. Of these, foreigners numbered 42,600, 
an increase of 1.3 times; Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, 
and Taiwan compatriots totalled 59,900, an increase of 4 
percent. Foreign exchange earned from tourism amounted to 84.05 
million yuan (foreign exchange equivalent in terms of renminbi), 
an increase of 1.2 times. 
<H5>  VI. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  New achievements were scored in science and technology, 
which 
provided fine conditions for the transformation of science and 
technology into productive forces. Research results were 
obtained in 280 projects, of which nine projects reached 
advanced international standards. A total of 205 projects 
received prizes for scientific and technological progress at the 
provincial level. Of this total, there were two first prizes, 18 
second prizes, 101 third prizes, and 84 fourth prizes. Among 
the research results scored by ordinary institutions of higher 
learning, 113 items passed appraisal, an increase of 25. The 
provincial government gave handsome awards to a number of 
scientific and technological development projects of a very high 
technical level and with outstanding economic results. By the 
end of 1993, there were 115 independent scientific research 
institutes above the county level and 24 scientific research 
organs under institutions of higher learning, which had been 
approved by the competent upper departments. However, the 
number of personnel engaged in scientific and technological 
activities declined and those reduced in ordinary tertiary 
institutions alone totalled 1,084 people. 
  Educational undertakings continued to develop in the course 
of speeded up structural readjustment. Provincial educational 
institutions took in 86 postgraduates and the total number of 
students taking graduate courses was 196. Ordinary institutions 
of higher learning enrolled 10,113 undergraduates for regular or 
specialized courses and the number of enrolled students totalled 
29,305. More than 40 new specialties were established in 
ordinary colleges and universities to meet the requirements of 
economic and social development. Some 17.3 percent of students 
were studying in these colleges or universities at their own 
expenses. Secondary vocational schools took in 24,435 students 
and the number of enrolled students in these schools totalled 
63,540. The enrolled students in senior and junior high schools 
totalled 124,500 and 881,100 respectively and the number of 
enrolled students in various secondary vocational and technical 
schools accounted for 47 percent of the total number of students 
receiving senior secondary education. The number of enrolled 
pupils totalled 4.398 million, with the enrollment rate for 
school-age children reaching 93.8 percent. Primary education 
was made universal in 74 percent of the 86 counties throughout 
the province and illiteracy numbers were reduced by 209,000. 
There were 985 kindergartens attended by 313,800 children. New 
achievements were made in tertiary education through self study. 
In 1993, 52,700 people signed up to participate in academic 
examinations through self study, achieving passes in 46,300 
single subjects and were granted certificates accordingly. The 
number of graduates through self study was 2,625, an increase of 
18 percent, but the high dropout rate remained a problem. In 
ordinary secondary schools, the dropout rate hit 8.9 percent, up 
5.3 percentage points, and in primary schools the rate was 7.5 
percent, with that in rural primary schools reaching 7.9 percent. 
  Cultural undertakings made contributions to enriching 
people's cultural lives. In 1993, the province successfully 
sponsored the "China Guizhou International Children's Art 
Festival." By the end of 1993, there were 32 art performance 
groups with 15 specialized art performance sites; seven 
broadcasting stations and 11 transmission and relay stations, 
with a coverage rate of 58.4 percent, a slight increase ; eight 
television stations and 1,350 transmission and relay stations, 
increases of one and 248 stations respectively, with a coverage 
rate of 66.2 percent, up 2.5 percentage points. There were also 
86 libraries and 84 cultural centers. In addition, 113.39 
million copies of books, 7.56 million copies of magazines, and 
170.26 million copies of newspapers of various kinds were 
published during the year. 
  Improvements were made in the conditions of medical care and 
public health. By the end of 1993, there were 1,623 hospitals 
with 51,900 beds, 1,563 out-patient clinics, 89 women and 
children health care centers, and 107 epidemic prevention 
stations among the 3,908 public health organs across the 
province. Meanwhile, the province boasted 103,000 specialized 
personnel for public health, including 4,067 practioners of 
traditional Chinese medicine, 20,521 doctors, 193 senior doctors 
combining Chinese with Western medical science, 8,613 
experienced nurses, and 9,723 nurses. 
  Urban markets were brisk while rural markets appeared to 
be bleak. In 1993, the retail sales volume of consumer goods in 
cities amounted to 6.308 billion yuan, that in county towns 
amounted to 2.639 billion yuan, and that in places below the 
county level amounted to 2.885 billion yuan, up 25.8, 6, and 4.3 
percent respectively. If price rises were allowed for, the 
actual retail sales volume of consumer goods in county towns and 
places below the county level declined by a relatively large 
margin. In particular, the total volume of the means of 
agricultural production sold to peasants during the year fell to 
1.29 billion yuan, down 6 percent. 
  The retail sales volume in the individual economic sector 
grew rapidly, while that in the collective economic sector 
declined. In 1993, the retail sales volume of the individual 
economy totalled 3.711 billion yuan, up 28.4 percent; that of 
the state-owned economy 4.899 billion yuan, up 7.5 percent; and 
that of the collective economy 2.628 billion yuan, down 4.1 
percent. The total volume of goods sold by peasants to 
nonagricultural residents was 1.861 billion yuan, up 28.8 
percent. The proportion of sales volume effected by individual 
economic sector and directly by peasants rose from 37.2 to 42.5 
percent. 
  Sales of commodities, food, clothing, and articles for daily 
use increased comprehensively and the growth tendency in 
clothing was conspicuous. In the retail sales volume of 
consumer goods, foodstuffs, clothes, and articles for daily use 
totalled 5.846, 2.307, and 3.679 billion yuan, up 12.9, 20.8, 
and 15.6 percent respectively. The ratio between them changed 
from 50.4:18.6:31.0 to 49.4:19.5:31.1 in 1993.

  The construction of rural bazaars progressed rapidly and the 
volume of transactions increased by a large margin. In 1993, 
the province raised funds through various channels to build 
rural bazaars and the financial input totalled 373 million yuan, 
of which 40.9 percent were raised from society. With the 94 
newly-built rural bazaars, the year-end figure numbered 2,718. 
The volume of business transactions amounted to 7.221 billion 
yuan, up 32.9 percent. Rapid growth was achieved by various 
specialized and wholesale markets for commodities such as 
medicine, poultry, eggs, fruit, grain, vegetables, small items, 
and so on. 
  Restricted by macroeconomic regulation and control, the 
purchases and sales in markets of the means of production 
presented a declining trend. In 1993, means of production 
bought and sold by material supply and marketing enterprises 
across the province amounted to 3.106 and 3.286 billion yuan, 
down 2.4 and 3.2 percent respectively. 
  Market prices rose sharply as prices in 1993 were the third 
highest in the past 15 years, after 1988 and 1989. The overall 
retail prices in the entire society rose by 14.8 percent and 
consumer goods rose 15 percent. The substantial price increases 
of food items, by 18.5 percent, was the major factor affecting 
the overall price level and their impact on the overall retail 
prices was 62.3 percent. Of these, grain prices rose by 46.6 
percent; edible oil 17.9 percent; meat, poultry, and eggs 25 
percent; sugar 28.9 percent; and aquatic products 12.7 percent. 
On the other hand, prices of fresh vegetables dropped by 2 
percent. The soaring prices of building and decoration 
materials and fuel was another major factor pushing retail 
prices upward. The prices of building and decoration materials 
rose by 31 percent and fuel by 41.1 percent. The extent of their 
impact on overall retail prices was 15 percent. Affected by the 
excessively rapid price rises in both food items and services 
charges, the margin of increase of residents' cost of living 
exceeded retail commodity prices. The overall level of urban 
and rural residents' cost of living rose by 16 percent, of which 
charges for service items including rent, water, electricity, 
communications, recreation, and so on went up by 19.1 percent. 
  The margin of price rises in rural areas was larger than in 
cities and towns. The overall retail prices in rural areas rose 
by 16.1 percent and those in cities and towns by 13.6 percent. 
The cost of living rose by 16.2 percent in rural areas while it 
went up by 15.8 percent in cities and towns. 
  Prices of the means of production increased universally. In 
1993, the production prices of industrial products rose by 18 
percent, of which those for industrial products such as the 
means of production rose by 28.3 percent. The purchase prices 
of major raw and semifinished materials, fuel, and power rose by 
44 percent. Of these, the prices of fuel and power rose by 36.9 
percent and those of ferrous metal rose by 83.6 percent. 
Judging from the principal types of the means of production, 
steel products, cement, and soft coal went up by 83, 77.9, and 
19.9 percent respectively. 
<H5>  VII. Foreign Trade, Economic Cooperation, and Tourism </H5>
  Persisting in the policy of promoting development with 
openness and fostering openness with development, the province 
lay firm hold of the construction of new hi-tech industrial 
development zones at the national level and economic development 
zones at the provincial level, positively conducted various 
tasks to solicit business and absorb funds from abroad and, 
through the coordinated actions of economic cooperation, trade, 
and tourism, extensively held various kinds of trade fairs and 
talks to quicken the pace of opening Guizhou to the outside 
world. 
  New breakthroughs were made in sports. At the Seventh 
National Games, 158 athletes from the province reached 18 
finals, in which they won four golds, three silvers, and one 
bronze medal. Participants in a total of 21 events finished 
between fourth and eighth places. The province's total of gold 
medals ranked 24th in the country and the collective score of 
114 points, ranked 27th, thus comprehensively achieving the 
objective of "increasing participation, increasing medals, 
raising scores, and raising places." The province staged 1,470 
sports meets at and above the county level with 430,800 athletes 
participating. In the major competitions at home and abroad, 
athletes from the province won 126 prizes including 18 gold, 25 
silver, and 14 bronze medals. Of these prizes, 12 were won in 
international competitions, 22 athletes broke 25 provincial 
records, and 12 athletes broke 14 adolescent provincial records. 
A total of 1,166,700 people reached the national standard of 
physical exercise, an increase of 45.6 percent. Of this total, 
102,600 people attained the superior class, up 39.3 percent, and 
six people reached the standard of national master sportsmen. 
<H5>  VIII. Social Insurance and Environmental Protection </H5>
  The insurance business was further expanded. Insurance 
premiums for the entire province reached 53.757 billion yuan and 
total income and expenditure for insurance services were 566 and 
307 million yuan, up 24.8 and 60.8 percent respectively. There 
were 186,900 claims with an indemnity of 182 million yuan paid 
for settled cases. 
  Social welfare undertakings developed rapidly. There are 
3,487 beds in 54 social welfare institutions run by civil 
affairs departments throughout the province, providing services 
to 1,696 people, increases of 46.8 and 9.9 percent respectively. 
The occupants in 866 homes for the aged run by urban and rural 
collective units totalled 6,039, an increase of 10.3 percent. 
In rural areas, 51,800 people were supported by collective 
units as individuals entitled to the treatment of "five 
guarantees." A total of 3.626 million people in financial 
difficulties received social relief from civil affairs 
departments. 
  New changes occurred in the labor markets. With increasingly 
wider and more numerous employment channels opening up, labor 
markets gradually advanced toward standardization, job search 
agencies sprung up, and a number of people were assigned jobs 
through labor departments. By the end of 1993, the total number 
of workers and staff members across the province was 2.356 
million. Of this total, those working in state-owned units 
numbered 1.94 million and those working under the contracted 
employment system reached 254,000, an increase of 4.3 percent 
and accounting for 10.8 percent of the entire workers and staff 
members. 
  New achievements were gained in environmental protection. In 
1993, there were 51 environmental monitoring stations and 1,310 
personnel under the provincial environmental protection 
department. During the year, 40 items of rectification of 
environment pollution were completed within limited periods and 
the financial input totalled 11.58 million yuan. Sewage 
disposal charges collected amounted to 24.006 million yuan. 
Twenty soot-control zones, covering an area of 78 square km, 
and 15 noise-control zones, covering an area of 67 square km, 
were constructed in 1993. In addition, three projects were 
acknowledged as scientific and technological research results 
with regard to environmental protection at the provincial level. 
<H5>  IX. Population and Living Standards </H5>
  According to a sample survey on population changes, the 
province's birth rate in 1993 was 22.6 per mill, up 0.2 per mill 
points; the death rate was 8.5 per mill, down 0.2 per mill 
points; and the natural growth rate was 14.1 per mill, up 0.22 
per mill points. Calculated on this basis, the province's 
population by the end of 1993 totalled 34,086,900 people, up 
473,400. As the number of increased population was larger than 
that of the previous year, the task of population control is 
still extremely arduous. 
  Along with the sustained growth of the national economy, and 
particularly with the accelerated development of the 
nonstate-owned economy in cities and towns as well as township 
and town enterprises in rural areas, the channels of residents' 
income were broadened. In the meantime, the people's living 
environment and facilities had also improved. According to a 
sample survey on urban and rural families, the per capita income 
used by urban residents as living expenses was 2,006.53 yuan, up 
22.5 percent, an actual increase of 5.8 percent after allowing 
for price rises. The per capita expenditure was 1,876.24 yuan, 
up 19.9 percent over 1992. The expenses for clothing items and 
daily necessities showed relatively greater increases of 21.9 
and 21.8 percent respectively, 6.7 and 6.6 percentage points 
higher than food items. The expenses for purchasing or building 
houses increased by 100 percent because real estate became a 
consumption hot spot among urban residents. The peasant per 
capita net income was 579.67 yuan, up 73.54 yuan or 14.5 
percent, which represented an actual increase of 2.7 percent 
after allowing for price rises. The net income derived from 
tertiary industry was 57.78 yuan, up 1.4 times, and peasant per 
capita cash payments came to 518.70 yuan, up 13.2 percent. Of 
this, payments used in production and as living expenses were 
137.44 yuan and 264.40 yuan, up 13.3 and 14.3 percent 
respectively. The margin of increase for urban and rural 
residents' income in 1993 was the largest since the beginning of 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan. However, further enhancement of the 
living standards of some urban and rural residents was affected 
due to the excessively rapid increases in the overall retail 
price level and the residents' cost of living during the 
corresponding period.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Henan Provincial Statistics </F>
Bureau; date not given: "Statistical Report Issued by Henan 
Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, led by the provincial party and 
government, Henan people seized the opportunity, deepened 
reforms, and increased the pace of the building a socialist 
market economic system and scored positive results in 
implementing the Central Committee's and State Council's 
policies of strengthening and improving macroregulation and 
control. The province's economy maintained the good momentum of 
relatively fast development. Urban and rural residents' income 
increased, and their living standards rose. Social projects 
progressed faster; preliminary statistics indicated that the 
province's GDP in 1993 was 158.029 billion yuan, up 15.7 percent 
from last year. Of this total, the growth value of secondary 
industry was 76.618 billion yuan, up 21.5 percent; and 40.414 
billion yuan for tertiary industry, up 11.5 percent. However, in 
economic operations, problems remained, such as relatively 
inadequate input into agriculture and infrastructure; production 
and operations at some enterprises were not good and their 
economic returns were far from ideal; and there was a greater 
likelihood of latent inflation. It still requires arduous 
effort to maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development 
of the province's economy. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993 the province paid greater attention to the status of 
agriculture as the basis of the province's economy and further 
induced peasants' production activity by market-oriented 
efforts. This, plus relatively good weather, resulted in good 
harvests in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and 
fishery. The growth value for the province's primary industry 
hit 40.997 billion yuan, up 10.4 percent. 
  Among the main farm produce, the total output of grains and 
oil-bearing crops rose to record high levels; that of fruits and 
flax rose considerably, but tobacco output went down quite 
considerably.

  Forestry and greening efforts made new headway. The total 
newly afforested area of the province in 1993 was 3.45 million 
mu, a net increase of 740,000 mu over the previous year. 
Forests with commercial value increased in proportion, 
afforestation improved in quality, forestry management was 
strengthened, and total greening area expanded further. 
  Output from animal husbandry increased steadily, with 
further 
increases in the proportion of animals raised to be traded. The 
output of major animal products kept rising and 
livestock-in-fold also increased.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Fishery production maintained relatively fast growth 
momentum. The output of the province's aquatic products in 1993 
was 138,000 tonnes, up 19.7 percent from the previous year. 
  Further improvement was made in conditions for agricultural 
production. By the end of 1993, the aggregate power of the 
province's farm machinery reached 26.24 million kilowatts, a 
growth of 8.2 percent over the end of the previous year. There 
were 1.01 million walking and small tractors, up 11.3 percent; 
42,900 farm produce-carrying trucks, down 0.2 percent; 
irrigation and drainage equipment with a total power capacity of 
6.66 million kilowatts, up 1.5 percent; and 71.138 million mu of 
fields under machine farming, up 1.6 percent. The amount of 
chemical fertilizers applied (100 percent pure) was 2.88 million 
tonnes, a 14.8 percent increase. Power consumption in rural 
areas was 6.11 billion kwh, up 2.5 percent. Effective irrigated 
areas of the province reached 58.02 million mu. However, the 
comparable price structure of farm produce remained irrational, 
socialized services in rural areas remained at a low level, and 
inputs and the incentives for agriculture awaited further 
improvement. 
  Township and town enterprises continued their strong growth. 
According to statistics from the province's bureau for township 
and town enterprises, the total output value of the all the 
province's township and town enterprises was 195 billion yuan, 
up 62.5 percent over the previous year. 
<H5>  II. Industry and the Building Industry </H5>
  The development of secondary industry increased rapidly. 
Industrial production maintained rapid growth momentum, and 
production matched better with sales. The growth value of the 
province's industry in 1993 amounted to 67.573 billion yuan, up 
22.1 percent over the previous year. Of this total, state-owned 
industry grew by 7.2 percent, collective enterprises 29.8 
percent, and large and medium-sized enterprises 15 percent. 
  There was adjustment in the industrial structure, with a 
notable market orientation and all-round development in light 
and heavy industry. The annual value of growth of light 
industry was 30.821 billion yuan, up 20.8 percent over the 
previous year, and that of heavy industry was 36.752 billion 
yuan, up 23.3 percent. Increases and decreases in product 
output reflected changes in market demand and supply and the 
effects of state macroregulatory and control policies. The 
output of products welcomed by the market grew faster.

  The economic returns of industrial enterprises improved. 
In 1993, the composite efficiency index of all the province's 
industrial enterprises was 96.4 percent, an increase of 10.4 
percentage points from the previous year. The production and 
sales rate of industrial products was 97.5 percent, an increase 
of 1.9 percentage points. The profit/tax rate on capital was 
9.8 percent, increasing by 0.5 percentage points. The profit 
rate on cost was 4.4 percent, increasing by 0.7 percentage 
points. The turnover of circulation capital was 1.57 times, 
0.02 times more than the previous year; and the overall labor 
productivity, in terms of value added, was 11,546 yuan per 
person. However, the rate of value growth slowed down. 
Economic returns did not rise evenly among enterprises: Large 
profit/tax increases for a few handsome profit earners such as 
the metallurgical and building industries disguised the poor 
economic returns in other enterprises. 
  The construction industry, pulled by rapid increases in 
investment in fixed assets, developed rapidly. The growth value 
for the construction industry in 1993 was 9.045 billion yuan, up 
16.6 percent over the previous year. Overall labor productivity 
was 7,409 yuan per person, up 7.2 percent. New progress was 
also made in design and works technology in the sector. 
  Geological prospecting also made new progress. In 1993, 
mechanized rock core drilling across the province covered 
239,500 meters of land, the province discovered 10 new mineral 
deposits, and increased reserves were reported for seven 
minerals. Prospecting of coal, bauxite, other nonferrous and 
ferrous metals showed larger reserves. 
<H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  Investment of fixed assets registered high growth. The total 
fixed-asset investment in 1993 for the province was 43.1 billion 
yuan, up 35.3 percent from the previous year, for real growth of 
9.6 percent in actual work amount [as published] after deducting 
price rises. Of this total, that made by state-owned units was 
28.305 billion yuan, up 49.6 percent; of which 15.151 billion 
yuan was in capital construction, up 50 percent; 8.532 billion 
yuan in technological innovation and transformation, up 45.7 
percent; and 2.168 billion yuan in commercial housing, up 147 
percent. The investment made by collective units was 7.571 
billion yuan, up 59 percent; and that by individuals was 7.256 
billion yuan, down 11.6 percent. Of the investment made by 
state-owned units, 10.345 billion yuan was in central projects, 
up 26.2 percent over the previous year, while 17.96 billion yuan 
was in local projects, up 67.5 percent. 
  The investment structure improved further, and 
infrastructure 
facilities and infrastructure industry were boosted. Of the 
total investment made by state-owned units in 1993, the 
investment in primary industry was 1.477 billion yuan, up 40.5 
percent over the previous year; that in the secondary industry 
was 16.084 billion yuan, up 27.8 percent; and 10.744 billion 
yuan was in tertiary industry, up 129.5 percent. Education and 
health obtained 912 million yuan in investment, up 49 percent. 
  Key investment projects moved faster. 5.846 billion yuan 
worth of investment was made in the 54 large and medium-sized 
capital construction and transformation projects the went beyond 
the fund ceilings, which was 96.9 percent of the annual planned 
amount. Eleven key projects, such as the Zhengzhou Thermal Power 
Plant, Luoyang Petroleum Chemicals Plant, No. 6 Mine of the 
Pingdingshan Mineral Bureau, Sanmenxia Huanghe Bridge, and 
Queshan Cement Plant, were built and put into operation or 
underwent testing, injecting new vitality into the province's 
economic development. 
  The increase in fixed-asset investment for the whole 
province 
in 1993 amounted to 18 billion yuan. The main figures for newly 
increased production capacity are as follows: 2.29 million 
tonnes of coal mining, 670,000 tonnes of natural gas and oil 
extraction, 510,000 kw of the installed capacity of generating 
units, 2.38 tonnes of cement in various grades, 2.87 million 
standard-weight boxes of plate glass, 117 km of 110,000-volt or 
above power lines, and 1,529 km of standard grade 4 highways as 
recognized by the Ministry of Construction. 
<H5>  IV. Transport, Post, and Telecommunications </H5>
  The province's transport industry transported 472,994,800 
tonnes of cargo in 1993, up 7.5 percent over the previous year; 
and 612,398,100 passengers, up 5.4 percent. Income for the 
province's transport sectors earned from transport services 
continued to rise. But transport modes remained uncoordinated 
and transport "bottlenecks" were an outstanding problem.

  Post and telecommunications service were further 
strengthened. The total turnover of posts and telecommunications 
service province-wide was 1.222 yuan, up 51.5 percent over the 
previous year. By the end of 1993, there were 478,900 city 
telephone accounts, an increase of 176,000 over the previous 
year. The proportion of program-controlled telephones increased 
to 80 percent of total city telephone capacity. Seventy-six 
counties (cities) have hooked into domestic and international 
program exchange networks. Paging and mobile phones have 
increased in number rapidly. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Trade </H5>
  Stocks and supplies for the consumer goods market were 
plentiful. Commodity supply continued to be bigger than demand. 
The total commodity retail volume of the whole province was 
61.636 billion yuan, up 21.3 percent over the previous year (or 
a real growth of 11.9 percent allowing for price rises). Of 
this total, the retail volume of consumer goods was 51.733 
billion yuan, up 24.8 percent; and that of agricultural 
production goods was 9.903 billion yuan, up 5.9 percent. Of 
this consumer goods retail volume, 45.455 billion yuan were 
sales made to residents, up 22.6 percent over the previous year; 
and 6.278 billion yuan to corporate bodies, up 43 percent. 
  Purchases and sales on urban markets were brisk and the 
recovery of rural markets was rapid. The total retail sales of 
consumer goods of the whole province in 1993 was 25.423 billion 
yuan, up 29.1 percent over the previous year. The total retail 
sales of consumer goods of all counties and places below the 
county level was 26.31 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent, and was 
6.8 percentage points faster than the previous year in growth 
rate. Viewed in terms of economic sectors, the retail volume of 
state-owned enterprises was 25.687 billion yuan, up 18 percent 
from the previous year; that of collective enterprises was 
18.619 billion yuan, up 22.7 percent, up 22.7 percent; and that 
of all other sectors was 13.316 billion yuan, up 26.9 percent. 
The retail volume of farming population vis-a-vis the 
nonfarming population grew 19 percent. 
  Of major commodities, the retail volume of food products 
grew 
steadily, with a 17.4 percent, 3.4 percent, and 3.6 percent 
increase over the previous year respectively for eggs, pork, and 
aquatic products. The sales volumes of consumer goods such as 
garment, color televisions, cameras, and washing machines 
continued to rise. 
  Markets for factory goods stabilized following vibrant 
activity. The total purchase by material supply and marketing 
units of the whole province was 27.048 billion yuan, up 30.1 
percent from the previous year; the total sold was 28.472 
billion yuan, up 28.1 percent. Of the major materials sold, 
steel products grew 26.3 percent and coal by 1.3 percent, while 
wood products grew by 26.3 percent. 
  In 1993, the state stepped up price reforms and further 
rationalized the price structure. The value of law played a 
much bigger role. However, because there was an abundant supply 
of commodities and residents became more mature in consumption 
behavior, not to mention prompt government regulation and 
controls, the market operated normally and rises in the 
province's retail prices were much lower than the national 
average. The province's general retail price index and the cost 
of living index for residents were lower their national 
counterparts by 4.8 and 4.3 percentage points respectively.

<H5>  VI. Foreign Trade and International Tourism </H5>
  Foreign trade developed further, although the export growth 
rate dropped. The 1993 total export and import value for the 
province was $1.925 billion, up 16.8 percent from the previous 
year on a comparable basis. Of this total, total export value 
was $1.366 billion, up 4.9 percent. Industrial and mining 
products accounted for 66.4 percent of the total export value, 
an increase of 2.1 percentage points from the previous year. 
  New levels were attained in the utilization of foreign 
capital. In 1993, 1,672 units across the province signed new 
agreements, 58.3 percent more than the previous year. 
Agreements on the utilization of foreign capital amounted to 
$2.195 billion, up 108 percent. Foreign capital actually 
utilized was $692 million, up 161 percent. Of this, $467 million 
-- 337 percent -- was in the form of direct investment by guest 
companies, the highest level so far of the province's actual 
utilization of foreign capital. Port construction increased in 
pace and investment environment was further improved. 
  Economic and technological cooperation with other countries 
made new progress. The province contracted 67 projects and 
labor service in 1993 with foreign countries, worth $87.06 
million in contract money. The completed annual operation 
revenue was $73.13 million, up 132 percent from the previous 
year. 
  International tourism developed faster. In 1993 the province 
received 129,400 tourists staying overnight, up 17.5 percent 
over the previous year. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism 
amounted to 88.53 million yuan (in foreign exchange 
certificates), up 7.7 percent. Of that, earnings from commodity 
sales was 4.78 million yuan, down 1.9 percent. 
<H5>  VII. Banking and Insurance </H5>
  In 1993, the province's banking sector conscientiously 
implemented the central authorities' spirit of strengthening and 
improving macroregulation and control, carried a sound and 
steady monetary policy, corrected problems in banking work, 
vigorously raised capital, and adjusted its credit structure, 
which effectively supported the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the province's economy. At the end of 1993, the 
savings deposits of all the province's banks was 114.388 billion 
yuan, an increase of 20.715 billion yuan over the figure at the 
beginning of the year. The balance of all loans was 137.205 
billion yuan, 23.536 billion yuan more than at the beginning of 
the year. The net amount of money supplied for the whole year 
was 6.409 billion yuan, down 7.9 percent from the previous year. 
  The savings deposits of urban and rural residents increased 
steadily. At the end of 1993, the balance of the savings 
deposits of all urban and rural residents was 76.717 billion 
yuan, an increase of 17.184 billion yuan over the figure at the 
beginning of the year, up 28.9 percent. 
  Further development was made in insurance. The premiums for 
all kinds of property insurance in 1993 totalled 179.3 billion 
yuan, up 23.5 percent from the previous year. Across the 
province, 16,594 enterprises participated in enterprise property 
insurance schemes; 800,700 households in family property 
insurance schemes; and 17,258,400 people participated in life 
insurance. Insurance companies handled 596,200 cases of claims 
of property loss and paid an indemnity of 760 million yuan and 
35,000 persons were paid 220 million yuan as damages in life 
insurance. 
<H5>  VIII. Science and Technology, Education, Culture, Public </H5>
Health, and Sports 
  Scientific and technological research made new progress. The 
rate at which scientific and technological research results 
being transformed into actual productive forces increased. In 
1993, 30 scientific and technological results won prizes from 
the state, of which three won state invention prizes, 22 won 
state scientific and technological progress prizes, and five 
state Spark prizes; 310 won the province government's scientific 
and technological progress prize, and 87 won the Spark prize. 
Soft sciences also achieved research results. New ground was 
broken in technological development and high-tech industry. In 
1993, 80 percent of the province's key scientific and 
technological research results were applied and popularized. 
The scientific and technological management and service system 
in rural areas were further improved. The "Spark Plan" played a 
positive role in sustaining the invigoration of the rural 
economy. 
  Technological markets continued to be active. The province 
signed 17,140 contracts on various technologies, 2,500 more than 
the previous year. The contract signed involved a transaction 
value of 901 million yuan. The province applied to the state a 
total of 2,299 patents in 1993, 301 more than the previous year; 
and authorized 1,669 patents, 940 more; and 23 percent of the 
province's patented technology found its way into production. 
  Scientific and technological backup services were steadily 
expanded. By the end of 1993, there were 6,717 technological 
and supervisory professionals actively drafting and revising 
provincial rules and regulations on technology. Cartographical 
sections drew 8,000 maps in various scales and published 16 
kinds of maps. Meteorological and seismological technical 
services made new progress to keep in step with the province's 
social and economic development. 
  The province's scientific and technological force continued 
to expand. At the end of 1993, state-owned enterprises across 
the province employed 878,000 technical professionals, 60,000 
more than the previous year. Of the scientific and 
technological personnel, those middle ranking or above numbered 
264,000, 66,000 more than the previous year. 
  Education developed steadily. In 1993, ordinary institutes 
of higher learning of the whole province enrolled 40,500 
students of general and special studies and 104,400 full-time 
on-campus students; and overall, there were 26,700 students 
graduated from these institutes. Such institutes and research 
units enrolled 386 graduate students, had 1,047 students 
pursuing graduate courses, and saw 338 complete their graduate 
studies. To meet the demand of the labor market, there was 
adjustment in the structure of higher education, and such 
adjustment scored results, with the ratios between the number 
and kind of courses and special studies better rationalized. 
The secondary education structure was increasingly 
rationalized. In 1993, ordinary technical secondary schools of 
the whole province had 163,900 on-campus students, 14,900 more 
than the previous year; agricultural (vocational) schools had 
258,600 on-campus students, 54,600 more than the previous year; 
and technical schools had 73,100 on-campus students. There were 
435,200 ordinary senior secondary school students. Basic 
education was continuously strengthened and the nine-year 
compulsory education program made new steps. In 1993, ordinary 
junior secondary schools of the whole province had 3,194,400 
students, and there were 9,515,000 on-campus primary school 
students. 98.9 percent of all the school-age children in the 
province were at school. The kindergartens had 1,834,800 
students. Adult education focused on job training and technical 
education continued to score new results. 
  Cultural undertakings developed healthily. Mass cultural 
activity continued to be active. Cultural activity with local 
characteristics was launched extensively. Province-wide there 
were 18 broadcasting stations and 17 television stations 
producing in 1993 a total of 70 television dramas. The 
provincial radio and television broadcasting covered 89 percent 
and 81 percent respectively of the province's population. In 
1993, the province published 2,313 kinds of books and 
pictorials, printed 918 million copies of newspapers, and 
published 104.9 million copies of various magazines. 
  Public health and medical conditions continued to improve. 
Year-end hospital beds for the whole province numbered 172,200, 
up 1.6 percent from the previous year. Professional medical 
staff numbered 298,400, up 3.1 percent. Of this number, there 
were 101,600 doctors, 2,600 more than the previous year; and 
52,500 nurses, an increase of 1,800. Prevention and medical 
care continued to be strengthened. In 1993, there were 193 
medical and epidemic prevention organs in the whole province, 
two more than the previous year; and 14,038 people working 
professionally for epidemic prevention, an increase of 1,039. 
Medical conditions in rural areas continued to improve. 
Medical stations spread across the rural areas of the province. 
The overall standard of medical care and services, however, 
remain to be raised. 
  Notable headway was made in sport. Athletes from our 
province won 39 gold, 22 silver, and 19 bronze medals in major 
domestic and international sport competitions. At the 7th 
National Sports Meet, our athletes won 20.5 gold, nine silver, 
and 18 bronze medals, and our province ranked 10th nationally on 
overall team scores and 6th in the number of gold medals won, 
taking our province's sports to the forefront of national sport. 
Sports among the people were pursued actively. 
<H5>  IX. Population and People's Livelihood </H5>
  Family planning made fresh achievements. According to a 
sampling survey on changes in the province's population, the 
birth rate of the population was 15.87 per thousand, the death 
rate was 6.35 per thousand, and the natural population growth 
rate was 9.52 per thousand, down 1.62 per thousand from the 
previous year. Calculated on this basis, the province's total 
year-end population in 1993 was 89.46 million, an increase of 
850,000 people. 
  Urban and rural residents' income increased and their living 
standards rose. In 1993, the total payroll of the whole 
province was 19.164 billion yuan, up 15.8 percent from the 
previous year. The per capita pay for the entire work force was 
2,557 yuan, up 12.7 percent. A sampling survey shows that in 
1993, the per capita subsistence income for urban and rural 
residents was 1,792.88 yuan, up 22.9 percent from the previous 
year, or 11.1 percent after allowing for price increases. The 
per capita living expenditure was 1,069.24 yuan, up 19.9 
percent, or 8.4 percent after allowing for price increases. In 
1993, the per capita net income of the entire rural population 
was 696.85 yuan, up 18.2 percent from the previous year, or 9 
percent after allowing for price increases; the per capita 
living expenditure was 564.93 yuan, up 19.5 percent or 8.4 
percent after allowing for price increases. Urban and rural 
residents' income rose further, but income disparity widened, 
and the actual consumption of some low-income families went down. 
  Reforms in the labor and personnel system continued to 
deepen. In 1993 the province found jobs for 243,900 job-waiting 
people in townships and towns. By the end of the year, there 
were 7,526,900 workers, an increase of 64,500 people from the 
previous year. Of this total, state-owned units employed 
5,778,200 and collective units 1,706,500. There were 1,636,400 
contract workers at state-owned units, accounting for 28.3 
percent of total workers employed by state-owned units, a rise 
of three percentage points from the previous year. Units of all 
other ownerships employed 42,200 people, an increase of 17,000 
people. The labor market continued to be active, a talent 
market was forming, and talent mobility was becoming 
rationalized, standardized, and institutionalized. 
  Living conditions for urban and rural residents improved. In 
1993, a total of 11,712,200 square meters of new residential 
buildings were completed in urban areas and 32.45 million square 
meters in rural areas. Per capita living space for all whole 
urban residents at year's end was 11.53 square meters, up 0.33 
square meters at the end of the previous year; that for all 
rural residents was 18.27 square meters, an increase of 1.13 
square meters. 
  The social welfare scheme continuously improved. In 1993, 
there were 2,484 various social welfare institutions across the 
province, sheltering 39,200 people. 7.51 million people in 
urban and rural areas received the benefits of social welfare. 
76 percent of towns and townships established rural socialized 
welfare networks. The coverage of social old-age pensions 
provided by enterprises continued to expand. Urban socialized 
service networks also developed more quickly, with 4,966 
community service facilities established. 
  Note: The GDP figures and growth value figures in various 
sectors in this statistical communique are calculated at current 
prices; whereas growth rates are calculated on comparable prices.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Hunan Provincial Statistics </F>
Bureau: "Statistical Report Issued by Hunan Provincial 
Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social Development in 
1993"] 
  [Text] Under the leadership of the Hunan party committee 
and government in 1993, the province profoundly implemented 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches and the spirit of the 
14th party congress, pushed reform and opening up forward, 
maintained growth in economic construction, promoted structural 
readjustment in a deepgoing way, improved the economic 
environment, raised economic qualities, accelerated economic 
growth, and made new progress in various social undertakings. 
According to preliminary statistics, the gross domestic product 
for 1993 totaled 114.6 billion yuan, a rise of 12.6 percent over 
the previous year. Of this, the figure for primary industry 
was 34.666 billion yuan, an increase of 4.2 percent; secondary 
industry was 47.034 billion yuan, up 18.6 percent; and tertiary 
industry was 32.9 billion yuan, up 16 percent. The major 
problems in economic and social development included capital 
shortages, excessive price hikes, and a lack of staying power 
for agricultural development. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In the course of structural readjustment, bumper harvests 
were reaped in agriculture. The agricultural output value of 
the province totaled 56.347 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 
5.3 percent over the previous year. An increase was registered 
in most of the major crops. A bumper grain harvest was reaped 
despite the decrease in the sown area and the natural disasters 
which hit early rice. Total grain output reached 26.31 million 
tonnes. Although the figure showed a 1.8 percent drop from the 
previous year, it was better than expected. The commodity rate 
of major farm produce rose by 2.1 percentage points over the 
previous year.

  A big step was taken in readjusting the product mix, the 
amount of famous brand farm produce increased by a wide margin, 
and the sown area of high-grade crops exceeded 90 percent. The 
sown area of top quality rice totaled 366,700 hectares, 166,700 
hectares more than in 1992. The proportion of fine quality 
cotton accounted for 85 percent of the total. The area of 
quality tobacco reached 60 percent and that of fruit, 80 percent. 
  The province afforested an area of 278,300 hectares, 
including barren hills, and was selected by the State Council as 
one of the advanced provinces in afforestation work. Of the 
major forest products, output of tea-oil seeds totaled 181,400 
tonnes, lacquer output was 31,221 kg, and tung-oil seed output 
totaled 53,200 tonnes, all decreasing to a certain extent. 
  New headway was made in animal husbandry and the output 
value 
amounted to 17.554 billion yuan in 1993, up 8.7 percent from the 
previous year.

  Growth in fishery continued and the output of aquatic 
products totaled 680,600 tonnes in 1993, an increase of 14.3 
percent over the previous year. 
  The growth of township enterprises accelerated. The total 
output value of township enterprises in 1993 amounted to 82 
billion yuan, a 69.4 percent increase over the previous year. 
Profits totaled 6 billion yuan, up 62.2 percent, and taxes 
delivered to the state totaled 2.8 billion yuan, up 55.6 percent. 
  The rural areas gave equal attention to the primary, 
secondary, and tertiary industries and readjusted their 
industrial setup. Secondary and tertiary industries developed at 
a particularly quick rate. The output value of the 
nonagricultural industries totaled 71.226 billion yuan, a rise 
of 37.2 percent over 1992. Of the output value of the 
nonagricultural industries in the rural areas, the rise in 
output of: industry was 37.6 percent; the building trade was 
11.9 percent; transportation, wholesale, and retail sales was 
53.3 percent, and catering was 45.6 percent. 
  Production conditions for agriculture further improved. 
The aggregate power of Hunan's farm machinery totaled 13.87 
million kw, a rise of 8 percent over 1992. Of this, rural 
irrigation amounted to 3.67 million kw, up 1.2 percent, and 
rural power consumption reached 3 billion kwh, up 8.3 percent. 
A total of 1.48 million tonnes of chemical fertilizers (100 
percent pure) were applied during the year, up 1.3 percent. 
  However, the problems which cropped up in the development of 
agricultural production must not be neglected. The problems are 
mainly the decrease in the sown area of crops, the drop in the 
number of different crops, insufficient agricultural input, a 
lack of staying power for development, and the widening gap in 
incomes between the urban and rural inhabitants. 
<H5>  II. Industry and Building Trade </H5>
  Industrial production maintained its rapid growth amid the 
shift toward a market economy. Hunan's total industrial output 
value for 1993 was 144.333 billion yuan, a 22.8 percent increase 
over 1992. Of this, the output value of industry at or above the 
township level totaled 110.651 billion yuan, up 15.6 percent. 
The output value of industry of other economic categories 
reached 6.907 billion yuan, a 4.5-fold rise; and rural industry 
output reached 33.982 billion yuan, up 54.8 percent. The 
increased value of independent accounting enterprises at or 
above the township level reached 30.82 billion yuan, up 32.9 
percent. Sales of industrial enterprises at or above the 
township level amounted to 106.08 billion yuan, up 14.7 percent. 
Of this, the state sector's output value was 75.12 billion 
yuan, up 6.8 percent, and the collective sector's was 29.242 
billion yuan, up 34.1 percent. Rural industry accounted for 
15.811 billion yuan of this amount, up 58.9 percent. The value 
of heavy industrial sales totaled 68.4 billion yuan, up 16.9 
percent; and light industry sales were at 37.683 billion yuan, 
up 11.7 percent. Viewed by trade, metallurgy, building 
materials, and machinery maintained rapid growth, while the 
growth in chemical industry and textiles was relatively slow. 
  Output of most of the major manufactured goods increased and 
that of steel, rolled steel, cement, caustic soda, and household 
refrigerators increased sharply.

  The situation of industrial production and sales was good on 
the whole. The rate of product sales reached 96.4 percent in 
the year. 
  Industrial economic efficiency increased somewhat. The 
overall index for economic efficiency of independent industrial 
enterprises was 105.7 percent, up 19.4 percentage points from 
the previous year. The all-personnel labor productivity was 
10,866.9 yuan (calculated in terms of added value), up 44.7 
percent. The capital tax rate was 14.6 percent and the profit 
rate on costs was 6.4 percent, both up 3.4 percent. New headway 
was made in turning deficits into profits. Among industrial 
enterprises, profit-making enterprises recorded a profit of 
5.559 billion yuan, an increase of 63.6 percent. The industrial 
enterprises at and above county level consumed 2.66 tonnes of 
coal for the output value of every 10,000 yuan, a drop of 10.1 
percent from 1992. They saved energy equivalent to 2.33 million 
tonnes of standard coal, 550 million kwh of electricity, and 
3.26 million tonnes of coal [sentence as published]. 
  Marked results were achieved in developing new products and 
quality improved somewhat. In the year, a total of 695 products 
obtained certification, of which 127 filled gaps in national 
production. New products turned out an output value of 1.05 
billion yuan and delivered 153 million yuan of profits and 62 
million yuan of taxes. Quality of manufactured goods improved 
steadily at a rate of 94 percent. 
  However, the overall economic efficiency of industrial 
enterprises remained low and the number of enterprises running 
at a loss and the amount of their deficits increased somewhat in 
1993. The great demand for capital was not fundamentally 
resolved for industrial enterprises and readjustment of the 
industrial structure proceeded with difficulty. 
  The building market remained brisk in 1993 and new 
breakthroughs were made in production in the building trade. 
The added value of the building trade amounted to 7.194 billion 
yuan, an increase of 8.3 percent over the previous year. Output 
value of the state building sector reached 5.086 billion yuan, 
up 42.3 percent. All-personnel labor productivity of the trade 
(calculated in terms of total output value) was 26,450 yuan, up 
38.5 percent. 

<H5>    III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  New headway was made in investment in fixed assets, which 
totaled 32.013 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 37.2 percent 
over the previous year, or a real increase of 8.8 percent after 
deducting the factor of price increases. Of this, investment by 
the state sector amounted to 21.021 billion yuan, up 40.4 
percent; investments by the collective units in urban and rural 
areas, 4.82 billion yuan, up 60.1 percent; and individuals, 
6.172 billion yuan, up 15.2 percent. Of the investment by the 
state sector, 12.403 billion yuan was injected to capital 
construction, up 36.5 percent; 6.146 billion yuan to technical 
transformation, up 25 percent; 2.246 billion yuan to commercial 
housing, up 200 percent; and 225 million yuan to other fields, 
up 0.6 percent. The central government accounted for 7.45 
billion yuan of the investment in fixed assets, while the 
localities accounted for 24.563 billion yuan, up 31.8 percent 
and 38.9 percent respectively over 1992. Viewed from the 
investment structure, the proportion of tertiary industry 
continued to rise from 45.6 percent in 1992 to 54.7 percent. Of 
this, investment in transportation, communications, and post and 
telecommunications increased sharply, with the annual investment 
totaling 4.07 billion yuan, accounting for 19.4 percent of total 
investment. In the secondary industry, investment in raw 
materials industry totaled 5.936 billion yuan, accounting for 
28.2 percent of total investment. 
  New progress was registered in key construction projects. 
Investment in the province's 30 major construction projects 
totaled 5.347 billion yuan, up 110 percent over 1992. The 
projects completed and gone into operation include: The 
caprolactam project of the Baling Petrochemical Company, the 
expansion project of the Shaoyang Cement Factory, the second 
bridge on the Xiangjiang highway in Xiangtan, and the Hunan 
Commercial Building. The projects that went into partial 
operation include Hunan post and telecommunications project no. 
165, the first phase dredging project of the Xiang Jiang 
channel, the Furong highway project in Changsha, and the foreign 
trade port in Chenglingji Harbor. 
  The new investment by state sector in fixed assets totaled 
11.594 billion yuan, a drop of 1 percent from 1992. New 
production capacities developed by state units through 
investment in capital construction and technical transformation 
include 180,000 tonnes of coal, 107,300 kw of power generating 
capacity, 534,000 tonnes of cement, 417.03 km of highway 
building, 350,000 tonnes of urban water supply, 10,000 tonnes of 
zinc electrolysis, 50,000 tonnes of pacrolactam, 20,000 tonnes 
of beer, and 30,500 trucks. 
  However, the results of investment in fixed assets were not 
good enough, mainly because of the long production cycle arising 
from the drop in the completion rate of houses, in the 
investment rate of construction projects, and in the fixed 
assets made available to users. 
<H5>  IV. Transportation, Post, Telecommunications </H5>
  Transportation developed rapidly. In 1993 Hunan opened seven 
new air routes, 14 passenger train routes, and dredged 57 km of 
river channels. Following the expansion of some highways, the 
roads were upgraded by 0.8 percent. Transportation conditions 
continued to improve. The volume of cargo transportation 
reached 96.011 billion tonnes per kilometer and passenger volume 
was 50.83 billion persons per kilometer in 1993, increases of 
6.5 percent and 5.5 percent respectively over the previous year. 
  Post and telecommunications developed by leaps and bounds, 
with the volume reaching 1.281 billion yuan, an increase of 65.9 
percent over 1992. Of this, long-distance calls totaled 
122.0189 million, up 112 percent; long-distance automatic 
telephone exchanges totaled 38,775, up 93.7 percent; and 
long-distance telephone lines totaled 19,305, up 150 percent. 
The number of telephone subscribers totaled 507,300 in urban 
areas, up 92.9 percent; and 98,100 in rural areas, up 34.6 
percent. There were 9,717 mobile telephone subscribers, an 
increase of 370 percent. Paging services developed remarkably. 
With subscribers totaling 207,000, paging services covered all 
the counties in Hunan, with an automatic network established in 
urban areas. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  The retail market remained brisk. The volume of retail sales 
totaled 53.919 billion yuan in 1993, up 20.4 percent from the 
previous year, a real increase of 4.6 percent after deducting 
the factor of price rises. Of this, the sales volume of 
consumer goods rose 22.3 percent, and the means of production 
for farming rose 7.3 percent. Retail sales in the state sector 
totaled 18.638 billion yuan, up 16.9 percent; in the collective 
sector, 13.051 billion yuan, up 8.8 percent; in the jointly 
owned sector, 470 million yuan, up 74.1 percent; and in the 
individual sector, 13.284 million yuan, up 33.1 percent. A 
volume of 8.899 billion yuan, a rise of 29.9 percent, was 
registered in the transactions between farmers and 
nonagricultural people. Of the sales of consumer goods, the 
figure rose 23.2 percent at and above county level, and 15.6 
percent at below the county level. Transactions at country 
markets were brisk, with the volume reaching 23.6 billion yuan, 
a rise of 39.4 percent from the previous year. 
  Purchases and sales of commodities were active. Hunan 
purchased 41.459 billion yuan of commodities in 1993, an 
increase of 14.3 percent over the previous year. Of this, 
purchases of manufactured goods rose 21.9 percent; but purchases 
of farm produce dropped 6.7 percent. Domestic sales totaled 
47.552 billion yuan, up 18.3 percent. Increases in domestic 
sales of major consumer goods included: Grain, up 10.1 percent; 
edible oil, up 80.8 percent; pork, up 24 percent; garments, up 
32.5 percent; television sets, up 7.8 percent, of which color 
sets were up 16.1 percent; and video recorders, washing 
machines, and refrigerators, up 28.5 percent, 29.7 percent, and 
31.6 percent, respectively. 
  The purchase and sales market for means of production 
remained steady. Purchases by the material departments totaled 
14.784 billion yuan, an increase of 30.4 percent over 1992, 
while sales totaled 15.378 billion yuan, up 28.2 percent. Sales 
of major materials varied, and: pig iron rose 45.7 percent; 
tires were up 5.4 percent; electromechanical equipment was up 
28.4 percent; rolled steel was down 14.3 percent; copper was 
down 51.6 percent; aluminum was down 45.8 percent; soda ash was 
down 15.7 percent; rubber was down 4.4 percent; and lead, zinc, 
and caustic soda were down 44.4 to 45.3 percent. 
  Market prices rose drastically in 1993. The retail price 
index rose 15.1 percent over the previous year. Of this, prices 
rose 15.7 percent in urban areas and 14.6 percent in the rural 
areas.

  The cost of living index rose 17.4 percent for workers and 
16.4 percent for peasants in 1993. The purchase cost of raw 
materials, fuel, and electricity rose 39.7 percent. Prices rose 
28.9 percent for manufactured goods, 14.7 percent for farm and 
sideline produce, and 29.4 percent for investment in fixed 
assets. 
  The main problems in the domestic market included: Market 
management failed to meet the developing situation and market 
order needed to be further rectified and strengthened. 
<H5>  VI. Foreign Economy </H5>
  New headway was made in Hunan's foreign trade in 1993. The 
volume of imports and exports totaled $2.35 billion, up 13.1 
percent from the previous year. Of this, exports totaled $1.61 
billion, up 14.2 percent, and imports reached $739 million, up 
10.8 percent. The volume of manufactured goods exported totaled 
$1.301 billion, accounting for 81.3 percent of total exports. 
The volume of exports by the three kinds of foreign-funded 
enterprises totaled $100 million, accounting for 6.2 percent of 
total exports. 
  Gratifying achievements were attained in the use of foreign 
capital. Hunan signed 1,491 preliminary agreements on the use 
of foreign capital in 1993, involving $1.24 billion, up 72 
percent and 118 percent respectively. Hunan made actual use of 
$697 million of foreign capital, an increase of 112 percent over 
1992. In the use of foreign capital, agreements reached on 
direct foreign investment amounted to $1.007 billion, up 93 
percent, but actual foreign investment amounted to $433 million, 
up 237 percent. There were 2,368 "three-kinds of foreign funded 
enterprises" registered at the end of the year, 1,344 more than 
at the end of 1992. 
  New progress was made in importing advanced technology. 
Hunan earned $183 million of foreign exchange, up 179 percent

<H5>  VII. Science and Technology </H5>
  The scientific and technological front scored marked 
achievements in serving the economy and market. Implementation 
of all the scientific and technological programs was smooth. Of 
the 409 projects, there were 162 scientific research projects, 
103 spark plan projects, and 100 projects to popularize the 
scientific achievements. The application rate of the projects 
reached 97.4 percent. The projects which passed the inspection 
test and have gone into operation turned out 1.03 billion 
yuan's-worth of products, 124 million yuan of profits and taxes, 
and $20 million of foreign exchange. The ranks of scientific 
and technological personnel continued to expand. By the end of 
1993, Hunan's state-owned enterprises and institutions had 1.09 
million professionals and technicians, of which 845,700 were 
scientific and technological personnel, an increase of 0.7 
percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, over 1992. A total of 
1,228 scientists, who made their due contribution, enjoyed 
government subsidies, and 256 were selected as advanced 
scientists and technicians in Hunan. The scientific research 
institutions were consolidated and further developed. There were 
176 independent natural science research institutions, two 
humane and social science research institutions, and 13 
scientific and technological information research and 
development institutions at or above the county level in 1993. 
There were also 170 research and development institutions in 
universities and colleges and 323 scientific research 
institutions run by large and medium-sized industrial 
enterprises. Hunan made 1,600 natural scientific research 
achievements, of which 352 won provincial-level awards. Good 
results were also made in social science research. 
  The scientific and technological market remained active. 
In 1993, the province successfully organized the Hunan New 
Technology and New Commodity Spring Fair and the Hunan New 
Technology and New Commodity Fair Aimed at Boosting Agriculture 
With Science and Technology. A total of 13,500 technological 
contracts were signed in 1993, involving 920 million yuan. 
  High and new technology developed rapidly. By the end of 
1993, Hunan had 640 high-tech projects in "five zones and one 
corridor," with an annual output value of 700 million yuan. 
  New headway was made in patent work. Hunan received 3,173 
applications for patent rights, and approved 2,766, an increase 
of 75.9 percent over 1992. 
  As the tasks assigned by the state decreased, geological 
workers made vigorous explorations and took an active part in 
social competition. The province discovered five important 
mines and examined a zinc mine and a gold mine. The amount of 
work done by the geological and mineral departments amounted to 
270 million yuan or an average of 19,200 yuan, an increase of 50 
percent and 57 percent respectively over the previous year. In 
a total of 226,000 work days, the surveying workers completed 
189 GPS surveying points, 449 km of grade leveling, 2,163 
surveying maps for topographic field operation, 300 surveying 
maps for interior work, 1,157 maps made from 340 km of aerial 
surveying, 24 types of map publications, and 24,803 copies of 
relief maps for the economic construction departments. 
  The hydrological, meteorological, and seismic departments 
offered a large amount of material and information for economic 
construction and people's livelihood, which had a marked social 
effect. 
<H5>  VIII. Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  To meet the needs of a market economy, new steps were taken 
in education structural readjustment. Hunan had 47 institutions 
of higher learning in 1993, which enrolled 40,100 students in 
the year, an increase of 21.8 percent over 1992. Students 
designated by units and those studying at their own expense 
increased 177 percent and 74 percent, respectively. The number 
of graduates totaled 24,600, down 2.3 percent. Universities and 
colleges had students numbering 111,000, up 16.4 percent. A 
total of 911 postgraduates were enrolled and 668 were graduated 
in 1993. There were 2,357 postgraduates in study. While 
readjustment of the secondary education continued, vocational 
education was also enhanced. There were 128,900 students in 
secondary and technical schools, up 20.9 percent, and 162,300 
students in vocational schools, up 7.8 percent. Of the 2.50 
million students in secondary schools, 372,000 were senior 
secondary school students, down 8.8 percent and 2.13 million 
were junior secondary school students, up 0.6 percent. There 
were 6.97 million pupils in primary schools, up 1.7 percent. 
The attendance rate of school-age children reached 98.3 
percent, and the proportion of primary pupils entering secondary

million children in kindergartens, up 7.8 percent. The rate of 
secondary school students discontinuing their studies was 9.17 
percent, and that of primary school pupils discontinuing their 
studies was 1.85 percent, both dropping slightly from the 
previous year. 
  Readjustment of adult higher education continued amid reform 
and quality improved somewhat. Adult universities and colleges 
enrolled 50,600 students, bringing the total number of students 
to 97,800, an increase of 26.3 percent over 1992. Adult 
secondary technical schools enrolled 61,700 students, bringing 
the total number of students to 151,000, up 8.4 percent. Equal 
attention was given to qualification and post training in adult 
education. A total of 7,903 received certificates through self 
study and examination, up 39.2 percent. Some 178,300 people 
extricated themselves from illiteracy. 
  Press, publication, and cultural undertakings continued to 
develop. Hunan published 1.151 billion copies of newspapers,

television coverage reached 86.9 percent. There were 8,862 film 
projection teams, and Hunan produced 8 feature films and 
distributed 262 new films. Of this, the television series "Ode 
to the River" won the national "Pony Award." 
  Public health developed steadily. By the end of 1993, the 
hospitals had 136,400 beds and 183,500 medical workers, which 
included 81,300 doctors and 45,400 nurses. Successes were 
achieved in preventing snail fever. The province eliminated 
snails from 11,200 mu of land and cured 70,200 patients 
suffering from schistosomiasis. 
  Sports further developed on the basis of the outstanding 
progress made in 1992. Hunan's athletes won 53 gold medals at 
the international and national games, which included four world 
level gold medals, 15 Asian level gold medals, and 34 national 
level gold medals. Three athletes smashed five world records on 
eight occasions, six athletes broke eight Asian records on eight 
occasions, and five athletes broke nine national records on nine 
occasions. At the Seventh National Games, the province captured 
15 medals and ranked ninth with outstanding achievements, 
enabling Hunan to become one of China's 10 strongest provinces. 
Mass sports activities developed widely. More than 3 million 
students meet the qualifications for the "National Standard for 
Physical Training," accounting for 75.2 percent of the students 
who took part in the activity. 
<H5>  IX. Population and the People's Livelihood </H5>
  New achievements were made in family planning work. 
According to a sample survey, Hunan's birth control rate 
reached 82 percent in 1993, a rise of 13 percentage points from 
the previous year. The province's birth rate was 14.08 per 
thousand; mortality rate, 7.13 per thousand; and natural growth 
rate, 6.95 per thousand. Based on these figures, Hunan's 
population totaled 62.51 million at the end of 1993, a net 
increase of 430,000 people over the end of 1992. 
  The people's living standard improved. More jobs were 
offered and incomes increased somewhat. The province had 5.85 
million workers by the end of 1993, an increase of 1 percent 
over the previous year. There were 604,000 self-employed 
workers and employees in urban private enterprises, 204,700 more 
than in the previous year. According to a sample survey, the 
annual average income of the urban inhabitants for living 
expenses was 2,443.83 yuan, an increase of 29.9 percent over 
1992, or a real increase of 10.7 percent after deducting the 
factor of price hikes. The province's wages in 1993 totaled 
17.7 billion yuan, a rise of 23.2 percent, and the average wage 
for workers and staff was 3,100 yuan, up 22.7 percent. 
  The peasants' average income was 851.87 yuan, a net increase 
of 112.45 yuan, or a real increase of 2 percent after deducting 
the factor of price hikes. Urban and rural savings deposits 
increased by a wide margin. By the end of 1993, the balance of 
urban and rural savings deposits was 47.337 billion yuan, an 
increase of 28.9 percent over the end of 1992. Of this, savings 
deposits by urban inhabitants totaled 33.105 billion yuan, up 
24.9 percent, and those by rural inhabitants, 14.232 billion 
yuan, up 39.3 percent. 
  Housing conditions for urban and rural inhabitants improved 
remarkably. The average housing space for urban and rural 
inhabitants was 7.3 square meters and 24.56 square meters, 
respectively. Auxiliary housing facilities also improved. 
  A new situation was created and marked achievements were 
attained in civil administration and social welfare 
undertakings. By the end of 1993, Hunan's social welfare 
establishments had 33,500 places, providing for 26,100 people. 
The civil administration departments provided relief to 5.37 
million people. A total of 7.22 million households in urban and 
rural areas, which were hit by disasters, received relief funds 
of 51 million yuan. 
  Social insurance developed vigorously in 1993. Premiums for 
domestic property totaled 128.268 billion yuan, an increase of 
18.1 percent; for overseas property, $4.908 billion, up 19.7 
percent. Incomes from the insurance businesses amounted to 2.01 
billion yuan, up 36.1 percent. A total of 504,200 insurance 
cases involving property were handled in the year and 764 
million yuan of compensation was paid. Insurance indemnities of 
519 million yuan were paid to 635,300 people. A total of 3.31 
million retirees and staff members joined the comprehensive 
social insurance scheme. 
  Thanks to overall planning and macroeconomic regulation and 
control over environmental protection, Hunan's environment 
remained steady, which to a certain extent alleviated the 
pressure of environmental problems on economic development. By 
the end of 1993, there were 4,169 environmental protection 
personnel, a rise of 7.2 percent, and 135 environment monitoring 
centers, three more than in the previous year. There were 20 
provincial-level natural environmental protection zones and 
three state level ones. The province invested 71.37 million 
yuan in dealing with 319 environmental pollution projects. The 
province built six smoke and dust control areas and 10 noise 
control areas. However, the task of environmental protection 
still remained arduous. 
  Besides making painstaking efforts to escort economic 
construction, the public security, procuratorial, and court 
departments attained marked achievements in improving 
comprehensive social order. In 1993 the province cracked 61,800 
criminal cases, including 19,200 major cases; prosecuted 3,128 
cases of corruption and bribery, tax evasion and resistance, and 
trademark violation, and 1,701 cases of dereliction of duty and 
encroachment of citizens' personal and democratic rights on file 
for investigation and prosecution; retrieved a loss of 114 
million yuan; and handled 185,400 cases of social order. 
However, the work of improving comprehensive social order 
remained to be strengthened.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Jiangxi Provincial Statistics Bureau </F>
on 17 March 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by Jiangxi 
Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th Central Committee, the whole province, from the top to 
the grass roots, seriously implemented a series of principles 
and policies from the Central Committee and the State Council, 
emancipated the mind, sought truth from facts, seized 
opportunities, accelerated development, and scored marked 
accomplishments in various aspects of national economic and 
social development. The pace of reform and opening up was 
quickened in a comprehensive way, and the national economy 
maintained a sound momentum of high growth, people's living 
standards continued to improve, and various social undertakings 
developed further. Initial statistics show that the annual GNP 
was 70.242 billion yuan, up 17.4 percent from the previous year, 
of which, the increased value of primary industry was 23.44 
billion yuan, up 6 percent; the increased value of the secondary 
industry was 27.302 billion yuan, up 33.9 percent; and the 
increased value of tertiary industry was 19.5 billion yuan, up 
by 13 percent. Local financial revenue was 6.565 billion yuan, 
up 30.8 percent. The annual growth rate of the entire national 
economy was the fastest since reform and opening up, and the 
growth rate of major economic indexes continued to be higher 
than the average level across China. The main difficulties and 
problems in economic operations were, namely, that the pace of 
industrial restructuring needs to be further stepped up, the 
range of price rises was comparatively high, the contradictions 
caused by a tight money supply have not been eased, economic 
returns need to be improved further, and the number of 
enterprises suffering deficits and the sums involved remain 
comparatively great. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, party committees and governments at all levels 
across the province gave rural economic development top priority 
in economic work and implemented the party's various rural 
policies in a down-to-earth way, with increasing the peasants' 
income and further augmenting agricultural comprehensive 
production capability as the target, and nurturing the rural 
market, optimizing the industrial mix, developing "three-high" 
agriculture and enterprises in townships and towns, and 
increasing agricultural inputs as foci to earnestly protect the 
peasants' enthusiasm in developing agricultural production, thus 
maintaining the sound momentum of the sustained rural economic 
growth despite serious natural disasters attacking the province 
on several occasions consecutively. 
  Agricultural production developed comparatively fast, with 
the structure continuing to be optimized. Gross agricultural 
output value (at constant 1990 prices, same in the following) 
was 34.499 billion yuan, up 7.3 percent from the previous year. 
Under conditions where a shrunken area was planted with grain 
crops and there were serious natural disasters, grain output 
dropped by 3.2 percent from the previous year; however, gross 
grain output was 15. 171 billion tonnes, exceeding the quota set 
by the state by 671,000 tones. Cash crops continued to develop, 
with an area of 1.171 million hectares sown, a drop of 3.4 
percent from the previous year.

  Forestry production developed vigorously. In 1993, the 
afforestation area was 243,000 hectares, of which the area 
planted with commercial forests was 44,000 hectares and forest 
shields covered 29,000 hectares. 
  Animal husbandry and fisheries production enjoyed sustained 
growth. Production of aquatic products topped a new record, 
with an output of 555,000 tonnes, up 34.3 percent from the 
previous year.

  Agricultural inputs increased and production conditions 
improved somewhat. Financial organs at various levels in the 
province spent a total of 757 million yuan supporting 
agriculture, up 13.8 percent from the previous year. The total 
horsepower of farm machinery across the province was 6.304 
million kw, a drop of 0.7 percent from the previous year; there 
were 9,000 large and medium-sized tractors, a drop of 21.5 
percent; 72,000 small tractors and rototillers, a 17.5 percent 
drop; 19,000 trucks for agricultural use, up by 3.6 percent; and 
irrigation and drainage equipment with a total capacity of 1.606 
million kw, up by 10.5 percent. A total of 930,000 tonnes of 
chemical fertilizers (in terms of 100 percent active 
ingredients) were applied during the year, a drop of 0.3 
percent, and rural consumption of electricity totalled 2.21 
billion kwh, up by 20.6 percent. Construction of rural 
irrigation and water conservancy projects was strengthened; 
1.864 million hectares of farmland had effective irrigation 
systems, up by 9,000 hectares; and the proportion of irrigated 
farmland as a percentage of all arable land rose to 80.2 percent 
from 79.4 percent in the previous year. 
  Enterprises in towns and townships maintained a momentum of 
fast-rate growth. In 1993, the gross output value of township 
and town enterprises across the province was 58.64 billion yuan, 
up by 92.8 percent from the previous year, of which industrial 
output value was 38.533 billion yuan, up 92 percent. 
<H5>  II. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In 1993, the industrial front further emancipated the mind, 
made progress despite difficulties, grasped the opportunity, 
deepened reform, and accelerated development, with industrial 
production continuing high-rate growth. Calculated at constant 
1990 prices, the province achieved an industrial gross output 
value of 88.261 billion yuan, up by 38.8 percent over the 
previous year, of which industrial enterprises at and above 
township levels achieved 60.566 billion yuan, up by 22.2 
percent. Of the gross industrial output value of enterprises at 
and above township level, that of state-owned enterprises 
increased by 13.9 percent, enterprises under collective 
ownership increased by 44 percent, and industry in other 
economic categories, with foreign-funded enterprises as the main 
channel, rose by 69.1 percent. Large and medium-sized industry 
played a backbone role, with annual output value rising by 21.3 
percent. 
  The industrial structure improved somewhat, and the 
development of light and heavy industry gradually became 
harmonious. The output value of light industrial enterprises at 
and above township level was 27.228 billion yuan, up by 21.5 
percent, and output of heavy industry was 33.338 billion yuan, 
an increase of 22.8 percent.

  Industrial economic returns improved further. In 1993, the 
comprehensive index of industrial economic returns rose to 78.81 
percent from 74 percent in the previous year. The marketing 
rate of industrial products was 96.5 percent, the profit 
tax rate on capital was 8.67 percent, the profit/cost 
ratio was 2.56, the circulation of capital was 1.64 times, the 
value-added rate was 25.75 percent, overall labor productivity 
in terms of value added was an annual 8,315 yuan per capita. 
However, the scale of the deficits of enterprises suffering 
from losses rose by 34.4 percent from the previous year. 
  The construction industry continued to develop rapidly. In 
1993, the value added by this sector totalled 2.666 billion 
yuan, up by 31.8 percent, of which construction output value was 
2.596 billion yuan, up 33.3 percent from the previous year, and 
overall labor productivity, in terms of gross output value, was 
18,124 yuan, up by 15.9 percent. 
<H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  In 1993, Jiangxi achieved 17.85 billion yuan of investment 
in 
fixed assets throughout society (excluding 2.354 billion yuan of 
central investment in railroads), up 42.4 percent from the 
previous year. Of this, investment in state-owned units was 
12.32 billion yuan, up 49.7 percent from the previous year; 
investment in local projects was 9.29 billion yuan, up 52.7 
percent; investment collectively owned units in townships and 
towns was 1.55 billion yuan, up 13.8 percent; and urban and 
rural private investment was 3.98 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent 
[all figures for fixed-assets investment as published]. There 
were 3,980 capital construction, renovation, and transformation 
projects in state-owned units across the province, a drop of 
12.5 percent. 
  Construction of basic industry and infrastructure was 
further 
strengthened. Of investment in capital construction in 
state-owned units throughout the province in 1993, investment in 
agriculture, energy resources, transportation, post and 
telecommunications, raw materials industry, and urban 
infrastructure was 4.11 billion yuan, up 75.6 percent. The share 
of this investment was 65.2 percent, a rise of 6.2 percentage 
points. Of this, investment in energy resources was 1.29 
billion yuan, up by 33 percent; investment in transportation, 
posts, and telecommunications was 1.35 billion yuan, up 1.2 
times; and investment in raw materials industry was 930 million 
yuan, up 1.6 times. 1993 was a year in which the building of 
railroads and highways in the province was of the largest scope, 
with the greatest investment volume achieved. The construction 
of the Jiangxi section of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway is in full 
swing; the Xiangtang-Jian Railway is about to open; 89.3 km of 
track has been completed on the double-track Zhejiang-Jiangxi 
Railway; the transformation of several major trunk highways, 
including the No.105 state highway, is in full swing; and the 
Nanchang Bridge and the Nanchang-Jiaotan sector of the 
Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway were completed and opened. Power 
construction is progressing smoothly at the Xinyu Power plant, 
the Jindezhen Power Plant has been completed, two 125,000-kw 
generating sets at the Pingxiang Power Plant were connected to 
the power network last September and December respectively, and 
four 3,200-kw generating sets at the Jinggangchong Hydropower 
station were all completed and put into production. 
  The construction of key projects made smooth progress. In 
early 1993, 78 key projects were in the plan, of which 33 were 
capital construction projects, and 45 were renovation and 
transformation projects. Twenty-eight projects were totally or 
partially completed and put into production, of which 10 were 
capital construction projects, and 18 were renovation and 
transformation projects. The 33 capital construction projects 
involved an investment of 4.54 billion yuan in the year, and 
100.9 percent [figure as published] of the annual plan was 
completed. Major projects completed were the Pingxiang Power 
Plant; Jinggangchong Hydropower Station; Nanchang Bridge; the 
Nanchang-Jiaotan sector of the Nanchang-Jiujiang expressway; a 
30,000-tonne main body project and two extra-large smelters at 
the Dexing Copper Mine under the jurisdiction of the Jiangxi 
Copper Industry Company; the Wushan Copper Mine southern ore 
belt; the Nanchang Qingyun Water Supply Works, which has a 
capacity of 200,000 tonnes daily; and the China Ceramic Sanitary 
Ware Plant, which has advanced imported technology and an annual 
output of 360,000 pieces. Regarding the 45 key renovation and 
transformation projects, an investment of 1.26 billion yuan was 
made and construction plans were completed in a comprehensive 
way. Several major, key projects were completed and put into 
production one after the other, including a production line at 
the Huayi Electric Appliance General Company for turning out 1 
million condensers; the 75/80 series production line at the 
Jiangxi Diesel Engine Plant, which boasts a manufacturing 
capacity of 20,000 engines; a production line at the Fuji Auto 
Manufacturing Plant, which has the capacity to produce 10,000 
light, all-terrain vehicles; a production line at the Xinyu 
Cement Works which can produce 60,000 tonnes of portland cement; 
and a production line at the Jiangxi Silk Textile Factory with a 
capacity to dye 16 million m of silk. 
<H5>  IV. Communications, Transportation, Posts, and </H5>
Telecommunications 
  Production in communications and transportation enjoyed 
steady growth; however, the restrictive contradiction of 
transportation "bottlenecks" remained conspicuous. In 1993, 
communications and transportation departments fulfilled a 
freight transport volume of of 27.623 billion tonne/km, up 4.7 
percent from the previous year. Of this, railway transportation 
increased by 8.1 percent, highway transportation dropped by 33 
percent, and water transportation dropped by 6.9 percent. The 
volume of passenger transportation fulfilled was 15.369 billion 
person/km, a drop of 2.4 percent from the previous year. Of 
this, railway transportation increased by 16.1 percent and 
highway transportation dropped by 25 percent. The volume of 
highway and water transportation in departments other than 
communications and transportation departments increased rapidly. 
  Post and telecommunications undertakings enjoyed accelerated 
development, with a value of 714 million yuan, up by 41.1 
percent on the previous year. By year end, the number of 
private telephone subscribers had reached 238,600, up 65,400 
from the previous year. The number of new subscribers for pager 
and mobile telephone services was 58,900. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Market and Consumer Prices </H5>
  The market was brisk and active. Retail sales of consumer 
goods in 1993 was 27.952 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent from the 
previous year (or real growth of 9.1 percent after price rises). 
Of this, the volume of consumer goods was 24.362 billion yuan, 
up 23.3 percent, of which sales to residents increased by 23.3 
percent and to social groups 22.9 percent. Rural markets 
continued to warm up, the volume of retail sales of consumer 
goods at and below county levels was 14.429 billion yuan, up 20 
percent, of which retail sales of agricultural production 
materials was 3.591 billion yuan, up by 8.9 percent. Comparing 
retail sales volumes for various economic categories with last 
year, state-owned economic entities increased by 18.6 percent, 
supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 10.7 percent, and 
other collectives increased by 9.7 percent; the joint-venture 
economy increased by 42 percent, the self-employed economy 
increased by 39.9 percent, and retail sales by peasants to 
nonagricultural residents increased by 21.8 percent. 
  The production materials market thrived. In 1993, materials 
and equipment supply and marketing enterprises at and above 
county levels across the province purchased 9.835 billion yuan 
worth of production materials, up 48.15 percent from the 
previous year. The sales volume was 10.098 billion yuan, up 
43.15 percent. 
  Price reform was deepened further. In 1993, the state lifted 
restrictions on factory prices for bulk steel products and some 
coal prices under unified allocation, railway freight 
transportation and power prices were raised, restrictions on 
factory prices for cement under unified allocation were lifted, 
and crude oil prices were raised. These price readjustment 
measures played a very important role in changing price 
conditions for basic products, with standards for infrastructure 
charges having been on the low side for a long time, and they 
promoted the formation of market mechanisms. 
  The general range of market price rises was comparatively 
great, and the general level of social retail prices went up by 
11.1 percent from the previous year, with a price rise range 1.9 
percentage points lower the national average. The range of 
price rises was 12.6 percent in urban areas and 10.1 percent in 
rural areas.

<H5>  VI. Foreign Economic Exchanges </H5>
  Foreign trade expanded further. In 1993, the export-import 
trade volume was $1.11143 billion, of which the export volume 
was $883.84 million, up 14 percent over the past year, and the 
import volume was $227.59 million, up 78.9 percent. 
  A breakthrough was achieved in the utilization of foreign 
capital. In 1993, the amount of foreign capital actually 
utilized was $343.46 million, up 72.2 percent from the previous 
year. The province signed contracts for 1,337 projects which 
utilized foreign capital in 1993, involving $1.01523 billion, 
increases of 38.9 percent and 35 percent respectively. Another 
495 foreign-funded enterprises were approved in 1993, up 1.4 
times.

<H5>  VII. Banking and Insurance </H5>
  In 1993, banking departments at all levels across the 
province earnestly implemented the central spirit of augmenting 
and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, stabilizing 
finance, promptly correcting problems surfacing in banking, 
actively absorbing savings deposits, strictly controlling loans, 
and rationally readjusting the direction of monetary flows. 
Consequently, the rational monetary demands of key national 
projects, industrial and agricultural production, and the 
purchase of farm and sideline products were ensured, while the 
tense circulating funds situation in some key enterprises was 
relaxed, thus powerfully supporting the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy. At the end of 
1993, savings deposits in various forms in state banks totalled 
44.122 billion yuan, which represented an increase of 9.981 
billion yuan or 29.3 percent over the figure at the end of 1992. 
Of this, enterprises' savings deposits accounted for 10.763 
billion yuan, an increase of 1.406 billion yuan or 15 percent 
over the figure at the end of 1992, and the savings deposits of 
urban and rural residents amounted to 32.165 billion yuan, an 
increase of 8.207 billion yuan or 34.3 percent over the figure 
at the end of 1992. The loan balance in various categories was 
60.954 billion yuan, an increase of 9.82 billion yuan or 19.2 
percent over the figure at the end of 1992. Of this, the 
balance for circulating funds was 42.786 billion yuan, up 16.1 
percent, and for fixed assets investment it was 11.837 billion 
yuan, up 29.1 percent. 
  Comparatively great development was made in insurance 
services. The underwriting volume of various kinds of property 
and life insurance was 142 billion yuan, and revenue from 
premiums for various insurance services was 974 million yuan, up 
21.5 percent from the previous year. At the end of 1993, some 
4.75 million households participated in household property 
insurance programs. Insurance companies handled 320,000 claims 
for property losses in various categories, and paid indemnities 
of 548 million yuan, thus playing a comparatively good role in 
compensating enterprises, households, and individuals suffering 
losses and promptly recovering production, operations and making 
arrangements for the people's livelihood. 
<H5>  VIII. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health and Sport </H5>
  Science and technological undertakings enjoyed vigorous 
development. In 1993, 109 science and technological results 
were awarded prizes for science and technological progress 
across the province, of which 25 items were awarded second prize 
and 84 third prize. One fine science and technological result 
was awarded a national prize for natural science, and another 
won a national prize for progress in science and technology in 
addition to three national prizes for innovation and three Spark 
prizes. Enterprise technological development work was further 
strengthened. Patent rights administration was markedly 
improved, with 998 cases of patent rights handled, up 4.6 
percent from the previous year, of which 807 patents were 
approved, up 88.6 percent. The technological market became more 
active. The number of technological trade organizations across 
the province grew to 1,450. In 1993, 2,640 technological 
contracts of various categories were signed, with a transaction 
volume of 171.541 million yuan. Meteorological departments 
worked hard to improve the accuracy and promptness of weather 
forecasts to elevate the socioeconomic results of the 
meteorological service. A number of results were scored in 
social sciences research, and some were accepted by related 
departments, and yielded sound social effects and economic 
results. 
  The ranks of scientific and technical personnel were further 
expanded, and mass scientific and technological activities were 
unfolded step by step. There are 730,000 professionals and 
technicians of all disciplines working in state-owned 
enterprises and institutions, of whom 308,000 are professionals 
and technicians in natural sciences, an increase of 12,000 on 
the previous year. There are also 422,000 professionals and 
technicians in the social sciences, an increase of 24,000. 
  New progress was made in educational undertakings at all

various categories of secondary vocational schools (including 
65,000 students in technical schools), accounting for 93.84 
percent of the total student body of 252,000 at senior secondary 
school level. Steady progress was made in the implementation of 
the nine-year compulsory education program. In 1993, there were 
1.575 million students in junior secondary schools, and 484,600 
pre-school children in kindergartens. 
  New accomplishments were made in adult education. There were 
36,300 students in institutes of adult tertiary education, and 
311,200 students in adult secondary vocational schools. In 
1993, 278,700 students sat for examinations in self-taught 
courses in higher and secondary education, of whom 82,400 were 
given certificates for single-course qualifications, and the 
number of graduates who received graduation certificates from 
full-time institutes of tertiary education, institutes of adult 
higher education, and adult secondary vocational schools was 
221, 3,867, and 185 respectively. 
  Cultural and art undertakings continued to prosper. By the 
end of 1993, there were 3,650 film-projection units in various 
categories across the province, 83 art performance troupes, and 
101 cultural centers, in addition to 104 public libraries and 82

<H5>  IX. Population and People's Lives </H5>
  In 1993, the crude birth rate in the province was 20.33 per 
thousand, and the crude death rate was 6.89 per thousand, 
resulting in a natural growth rate of 13.44 per thousand. By 
the end of 1993, the province's total population came to 39.6604 
million, up by 529,500 from the previous year. 
  There was a comparatively rapid increase in personal income. 
The annual per capita income of urban residents used for living 
expenses was 1,786.22 yuan, up 25.85 percent from the previous 
year, a real growth of 8.68 percent allowing for price rises and 
the highest growth rate since reform and opening up. The per 
capita net income of rural residents was 869.81 yuan, up 101.4 
yuan or 13.2 percent from the previous year, a real growth of 
2.9 percent allowing for price rises and the greatest increase 
since reform and opening up.

percent from the previous year. The number of staffers and 
workers in state-owned units was 3.282 million, 62,000 more than 
at the end of 1992. There were 398,000 self-employed workers in 
urban areas, an increase of 66,000 persons. 
  Urban and rural living conditions continued to improve. A 
total of 6.396 million square meters of new residential 
buildings were completed in urban areas by state-owned and urban 
collective units, and 23.98 million square meters of new 
residential buildings were completed in rural areas across the 
province. 
  Comparatively great progress was made in social welfare. By 
the end of 1993, the number of social welfare institutions 
reached 2,388, providing places for 47,700 inmates, and 31,537 
units participated in old-age pension insurance provided by 
society as a whole, with the participation of 2.5112 million 
staffers, workers, and retired workers from state-owned 
enterprises, institutions, and collective enterprises at and 
above county level. 
  Rapid progress was made in environmental protection. By the 
end of 1993, there were 92 environmental monitoring stations, 1 
national natural protection zone, and 8 provincial natural 
protection zones in the province. The number of projects to 
combat environmental pollution completed within a specified time 
amounted to 131, absorbing a total investment of 18.2 million 
yuan. Thirty-one smog-control zones were established in 17 
cities (including county-level cities), covering an area of 
1,126 square km, and 22 environmental noise-control zones were 
build in 17 cities, covering an area of 52 square km. 
Notes: 
  1. Figures in value terms on gross national product and 
value added by various sectors quoted in this communique are at 
current prices, while growth rates are calculated at comparable 
prices. 
  2. Gross domestic product and value added by various 
sectors mainly includes workers wage bills, profits, tax 
revenues, and depreciation, but does not include various 
intermediate consumption of energy resources and raw materials. 
They give expression to the total annual production value of 
material products and services used in society. The difference 
between gross domestic product and gross national product lies 
in the fact that the former does not include net (outside 
region) income from overseas.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region </F>
Statistics Bureau; date not given: "Statistical Report Issued 
by the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Statistics Bureau on 
National Economic and Social Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the correct leadership of the CPC 
committee and the people's government of the Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region, people of various nationalities in the region 
seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
carried out in-depth reforms, expanded opening-up, seized the 
opportune moment, and quickened development. Macroeconomic 
environment, social supply, and demand relations were improved, 
and the national economy and social undertakings in the whole 
region achieved remarkable success. 
  In the whole year, the gross domestic product (GDP) was 9.65 
billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the previous year, 
of which the added value of primary industry (agriculture) 
amounted to 2.03 billion yuan, an increase of 5.5 percent; the 
added value of secondary industry (industry and building 
industry) amounted to 4.5 billion yuan, an increase of 12.9 
percent, in which industry amounted to 3.65 billion yuan, up 
12.8 percent, and building industry amounted to 850 million 
yuan, up 13.3 percent; and the added value of tertiary industry 
amounted to 3.12 billion yuan, an increase of 9.5 percent. 
Industrial structure was further optimized, and the structure 
ratio of tertiary industry was changed from 27.6:41.5:30.9 in 
1990 to 21.1:46.6:32.3. Per capita GDP was 1,965 yuan, an 
increase of 320 yuan over the previous year, up 19 percent. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993 the autonomous region further strengthened 
leadership 
over agriculture and rural work, intensified the foundation 
position of agriculture, quickened the pace of rural reforms, 
and constantly built and improved the agricultural socialized 
service system. Varied measures were taken to reduce the 
peasants' burdens, which resulted in an overall agricultural 
bumper harvest and sustained development of the rural economy. 
Total agricultural output reached 3.19 billion yuan, an 
increase of 6.7 percent over 1992, of which farming output 
amounted to 2.27 billion yuan, up by 9.8 percent; animal 
husbandry output amounted to 750 million yuan, up by 5.2 
percent; fishery output amounted to 80 million yuan, up by 12 
percent. 
  Agricultural production further entered a new stage. With 
the restructuring of the growing of crops, areas sown with 
refined strains of seeds were enlarged, and the output of most 
of the crops went up except for the reduction of paddy rice 
output due to the impact of low temperatures. Total grain 
output in the whole region broke the 2-million-ton record, and 
reached an all-time high of 2.03 million tons, of which summer 
crops amounted to 945,000 tons, up 28.3 percent, and autumn 
crops amounted to 1.085 million tons, down 3.1 percent.

  Forestry production made new progress. Afforestation area in 
the whole region in 1993 totalled 361,000 mu, an increase of 48 
percent over the previous year. 
  Animal husbandry production continued to develop. Output of 
major animal products and the amount of most livestock increased.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  There was sustained growth in fishery production. The annual 
output of aquatic products totalled 15,000 tons, an increase of 
12.4 percent over that of the previous year. 
  The conditions of agricultural production continued to 
improve. At the end of 1993, the total power of agricultural 
machines in the whole region amounted to 2.176 million 
kilowatts, up 2.6 percent. The region had 5,000 large and 
medium-sized tractors, down 14 percent; 105,000 baby and hand 
tractors, up 5.1 percent; 4,000 trucks for agricultural use, 
even with the previous year; and power-driven irrigation and 
drainage machines with power amounting to 142,000 kilowatts, 
even with the previous year. As a result of the big increase in 
the prices of agricultural means of production, the amount of 
chemical fertilizer and electricity used for agriculture was 
reduced. The annual amount (conversion net) of chemical 
fertilizer applied totalled 134,000 tons, down 2.2 percent; and 
the amount of electricity used in the rural areas totalled 480 
million kwh, down 1.9 percent. The construction of water 
conservancy work was strengthened, and newly increased effective 
area under irrigation amounted to 103,000 mu. 
  There was an overall development of township and town 
enterprises in rural areas. In 1993, the total output of 
township and town enterprises in the whole region reached 3.06 
billion yuan, an increase of 42 percent over the previous year. 
  In rural economic development, the problem of unsynchronized 
growth of agricultural production and the increase in peasants' 
income remained. 
<H5>  II. Industry and the Building Industry </H5>
  In 1993, industrial enterprises in the whole region overcame 
unfavorable factors, such as a funds shortage, a drastic 
increase in the prices of raw and processed materials, and the 
inadequate transport capacity. With the market as a guide, they 
readjusted the product mix, increased scientific and 
technological input, and vigorously developed the work of 
technological transformation and of tapping potential and 
reducing consumption, which enabled industry to maintain a 
momentum of sustained, healthy, and high-speed development. In 
1993, the region's total industrial output, including industry 
of the village level and below, broke the 10-billion-yuan record 
for the first time, and reached 12.08 billion yuan, an increase 
of 13.9 percent over 1992. In total industrial output, the 
output of the township level and above reached 11.28 billion 
yuan, up 12.1 percent. In total industrial output of the 
township level and above, heavy industrial output amounted to 
9.17 billion yuan, up 15.4 percent; and light industrial output 
amounted to 2.11 billion yuan, up 1.8 percent. Divided by 
economic types, state-owned industry amounted to 9.41 billion 
yuan, up 9.5 percent; and collective industry amounted to 1.68 
billion yuan, up 20 percent, of which township-run industry 
amounted to 690 million yuan, up 44 percent.

  Industrial economic performance was greatly improved. 
According to statistics by independent accounting industrial 
enterprises in the whole region, income from product sales added 
up to 10.66 billion yuan, an increase of 55 percent over the 
previous year; the total amount of profits and taxes reached 980 
million yuan, an increase of 54.7 percent; the total amount of 
profits with losses deducted was 180 million yuan, an increase 
of 135 percent; and the composite economic performance index was 
76.6 percent, an increase of 10 percentage points over those of 
the previous year. Of the six factors that made up the 
composite economic performance index, the production and sales 
rate reached 97.6 percent, an increase of 2.2 percentage points; 
the profits and tax rate of funds was 6.5 percent, an increase 
of 1.5 percentage points over 1992; the cost and expense profit 
rate was 1.9 percent, an increase of 0.6 percentage points; 
labor productivity was 10,688 yuan per person, an increase of 
30.2 percent; the floating funds turnover rate was 1.4 times, an 
increase of 0.1 times; and the added value rate was 31.4 
percent, dropping by 1.7 percentage points. But the overall 
industrial economic performance remained low, and quite a large 
number of enterprises were still losing money. 
  The production situation of building enterprises took a 
favorable turn in 1993. With the high-speed growth of fixed 
asset investments and constant in-depth reforms of building 
enterprises, state-owned building enterprises fulfilled a total 
annual output of 1.06 billion yuan, an increase of 32 percent 
over the previous year. All-member labor productivity 
calculated by total output was 22,999 yuan per person, an 
increase of 39.4 percent over 1992. Area under construction in 
the whole year totalled 1.758 million square meters, up 25 
percent, of which the area completed totalled 740,000 square 
meters, even 5with that of the previous year. Among 1,567 
projects under construction in the whole year, 1,365 projects 
carried out the contract-based responsibility system, accounting 
for 87 percent. Enterprise economic performance took a further 
turn for the better. 
<H5>  III. Fixed Asset Investment </H5>
  Fixed asset investment grew by a big margin, and 
preferential 
measures were taken for investments in capital construction and 
technological transformation projects. All-society fixed asset 
investments reached 5.16 billion yuan, an increase of 35.5 
percent, and was the third highest growth year since reform and 
opening-up began. In these investments, central authorities 
projects reached 1.79 billion yuan, an increase of 54.7 percent; 
and local projects reached 3.37 billion yuan, an increase of 
27.1 percent. There was overall growth of various economic 
investments, of which state-owned units reached an investment 
level of 4.14 billion yuan, up 35 percent; and collective units 
reached 610 million yuan, up 103 percent. In state-owned unit 
investments, capital construction investments amounted to 2.59 
billion yuan, an increase of 31.8 percent; renovation and 
transformation investments amounted to 1.12 billion yuan, an 
increase of 40.2 percent; and commodity residential flat 
investments amounted to 260 million yuan, an increase of 65 
percent. Capital construction investments based on trades were: 
Agricultural investment reached 148 million yuan, even with that 
of the previous year; industrial investments reached 910 million 
yuan, up 10.6 percent (energy investments reached 680 million 
yuan, up 44.7 percent, accounting for 26.3 percent of capital 
construction investments); investments in commerce and food and 
drinks business totalled 204 million yuan, an increase of 94 
percent; real estate investment amounted to 69 million yuan, up 
25 percent; culture, education, and public health amounted to 96 
million yuan, up 7.8 percent; scientific research amounted to 11 
million yuan, up by 83 percent; and investments in 
communications, post, and telecommunications amounted to 960 
million yuan, an increase of 81 percent, accounting for 37 
percent of capital construction investments. 
  Major construction and large and medium-sized construction 
projects made new achievements. The Baoji-Zhongwei Railway 
reached an investment of over 600 million yuan, and tracks were 
laid from Zhongwei to Guyuan; the phase-five extension project 
of the Shizuishan Power Plant was completed; construction of 
three coal mine areas of Lingwu, Shizuishan, and Shitanjing was 
in full swing; construction on the Yanhuanding Pumping Project, 
Yin-Gu Highway, and Yinchuan Yellow River Bridge was drawing to 
an end; and the early-stage preparatory work of the construction 
of Yinchuan Hedong Airport was under way. The preparations for 
the phase-two project of the Daba Power Plant were completed, 
and work can start officially in 1994. The Northwest Ball 
Bearing Factory, Yinchuan Rubber Factory, Ningxia Cement 
Factory, and other major technological transformation projects 
were going smoothly. 
  Construction projects were relatively concentrated. There 
were 1,220 capital construction and technological transformation 
projects of state-owned units, a reduction of 194 projects from 
those of the previous year, and among them, 780 projects were 
newly started, a reduction of 229 projects. In 1993 there were 
384 capital construction projects and 320 renovation and 
transformation projects of state-owned units completed and put 
into operation in the whole region. The area of houses under 
construction in the whole society totalled 7.05 million square 
meters, and the area of houses completed totalled 5.41 million 
square meters, with a project completion rate of 76.7 percent, 
in which the area of residential flats completed totalled 4.09 
million square meters. 
<H5>  IV. Communications, Post, and Telecommunications </H5>
  In 1993, communications, post, and telecommunications 
undertakings in the whole region made rapid development as a 
result of continued preferential policies, an increase in input, 
a quickening of the construction of railway, highway, post, and 
telecommunications infrastructure, an increase in airlines and 
flights, and a heightening of the equipment level of post and 
telecommunications offices. The added value realized in the 
whole year totalled 610 million yuan, an increase of 7.8 percent 
over the previous year.

  Post and telecommunications undertakings developed rapidly. 
Total post and telecommunications business volume fulfilled in 
the whole year amounted to 102.62 million yuan, an increase of 
53.4 percent over the previous year, of which were manifold 
increases in the business of express delivery, wireless paging, 
and mobile telephones. The total number of city telephones 
reached 91,163, an increase of 39 percent; and 
program-controlled telephones in the whole region reached 
59,562, an increase of 36,100 telephones over the previous year, 
up 1.5 times. 
<H5>  V. Domestic and Foreign Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  Urban and rural markets were brisk, with an ample supply of 
commodities. In 1993 the total amount of social commodity 
retail sales in the whole region was 4.3 billion yuan, an 
increase of 15.4 percent over the previous year, of which 
consumer goods retail sales amounted to 3.77 billion yuan, an 
increase of 18.8 percent. In consumer goods retail sales, sales 
to residents amounted to 3.36 billion yuan, up 19.9 percent. 
Divided by urban and rural areas, sales in cities amounted to 
2.25 billion yuan, up 19.1 percent; sales at the county level 
amounted to one billion yuan, up 20 percent; and sales below the 
county level amounted to 520 million yuan, up 15.2 percent. 
  There was overall growth in commodity retail sales of 
various 
economic types. State-owned business retail sales in 1993 
amounted to two billion yuan, an increase of 12.1 percent over 
the previous year, accounting for 46.5 percent of total retail 
sales; collective business retail sales amounted to 960 million 
yuan, an increase of 0.9 percent; individual business retail 
sales amounted to 730 million yuan, an increases of 31.5 
percent; country fair trade was extremely brisk, and the sales 
of wares by peasants to nonpeasants amounted to 600 million 
yuan, up 39.5 percent. The growth in the sales of various major 
consumer goods was: Grain grew by 10.5 percent, eggs by two 
times, aquatic products by 38.5 percent, various kinds clothing 
by 75.3 percent, TV sets by 14 percent, and refrigerators by 
37.1 percent. 
  In the first half of the year there was tension between 
supply and demand in the market of the means of production, and 
prices went up. In the second half of the year, the market 
turned brisk, with an ample supply of goods, and prices went 
down. Annual sales of the agricultural means of production 
dropped by 4 percent from those of the previous year. 
  Foreign trade developed further. In 1993, the total foreign 
import and export value in the whole region amounted to 143.50 
million dollars, an increase of 14.2 percent, of which export 
amounted to 111.24 million dollars, down 1.1 percent, and import 
amounted to 32.26 million dollars, an increase of 99 percent. 
Export commodities increased to 140 varieties. The annual 
export volume of foreign-funded enterprises amounted to 5.51 
million dollars, up 1.1 times. 
  The use of foreign investment increased by a big margin. In 
1993 the actual use of foreign investment amounted to 36.66 
million dollars, an increase of 2.6 times over 1992. Contracts 
for 181 projects were newly signed for foreign-funded 
enterprises, an increase of 118 percent, and actual use of 
foreign investments in these contracts amounted to 11.90 million 
dollars, an increase of 2.4 times. At the end of the year, 
there were 261 foreign-funded enterprises, an increase of 187 
percent. 
  In 1993, visitors coming to Ningxia from overseas and from 
Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan totalled 2,905 person trips, and 
foreign exchange income from tourism amounted to 3.75 million 
yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year. 
  Pricing reforms made bigger strides forward, and there were 
big increases in market prices. Under the nationwide unified 
arrangement, a number of pricing reforms were introduced in a 
planned way. Prices of grain and other important commodities 
were released; and rent and the prices of service items, 
electric power, fuel, and other living expenses were raised. 
The extent of marketization of the economy as a whole was 
enhanced, and the proportion of market regulation increased. 
However, due to incomplete complementary measures for pricing 
reforms, market prices rose rapidly, the overall price level was 
obviously too high, and the price scissors between industrial 
products and agricultural products further widened.

<F P=106> ["Communique" issued by the Shaanxi Provincial Statistics </F>
Bureau on 24 February 1993: "Statistical Report Issued by the 
Shaanxi Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and 
Social Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the Shaanxi 
Provincial CPC Committee and Government, all the people of 
Shaanxi comprehensively implemented the guidelines of the 14th 
CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, quickened the pace of reform, opening up, and 
economic construction, and achieved obvious results in improving 
the macroenvironment and strengthening macroregulation and 
control. The national economy of the whole province grew 
rapidly, various social undertakings developed further, the 
living standards of the people were further improved, and a 
solid foundation was laid for further deepening reform, opening 
wider to the outside world, and the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 
1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy 
throughout the whole province in 1994. According to preliminary 
statistics, the domestic gross output value for the year was 
60.34 billion yuan, 12 percent up from the previous year, of 
which the added value of primary industry was 13.58 billion 
yuan, an increase of 9.6 percent; the added value of secondary 
industry was 29.12 billion yuan, an increase of 17.3 percent; 
and the added value of tertiary industry was 17.64 billion yuan, 
an increase of 5.3 percent. The major problems in economic 
operations were: The situation regarding poor economic results 
has not yet been fundamentally changed; prices rose too fast and 
the pressure of inflation increased; financial resources were 
insufficient and the shortage of funds was quite conspicuous; 
and constraining factors in basic industries and infrastructure 
increased and this was not in keeping with the needs of the 
economic and social development. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, governments at all levels resolutely implemented a 
series of measures to strengthen agriculture and rural work 
adopted by the central authorities, reduced peasants' burden, 
increased input into agriculture, continued to readjust the 
production structure in rural areas, made great efforts to carry 
out construction of water conservancy works, and reaped 
unprecedented bumper harvests in agricultural production. The 
added value of agriculture for the whole year was 13.58 billion 
yuan, 9.6 percent over the previous year. 
  Relatively great progress was made in readjusting the 
production structure of agriculture and the percentage of 
high-quality, high-output, high-added-value products increased. 
The output of grain, edible oils, and fruit increased by a big 
margin, reaching a record high. Because of the reduced growing 
area and serious natural disasters, the output of cotton and 
cured tobacco was less than in the previous year. The output of 
major agricultural produce was as follows:

  Trees were planted over a total area of 374,000 hectares in 
the province, slightly less than in the previous year, and the 
structure of forestry production was further readjusted, the 
quality was improved, the area of economic forests and forests 
for engineering purposes clearly expanded, and the output of 
forest products increased comprehensively. 
  Animal husbandry production developed steadily and the 
production level rose. The increase in output of major 
livestock products such as meat, eggs, and milk was as follows:

  Fishery production continued to maintain a momentum of 
rapid growth and the output of aquatic products increased by a 
big margin. Aquatic products output was 31,000 tonnes, up 14.8 
percent. 
  The conditions for agricultural production continued to 
improve. By the end of 1993, the total capacity of farm machines 
was 7,331,000 kw, an increase of 0.3 percent; the area of 
effectively irrigated farmland was 1.31 million hectares, an 
increase of 0.8 percent; the amount of chemical fertilizer used 
in farmland (converted into straight products) was 931,000 
tonnes, an increase of 9.9 percent; and the amount of 
electricity consumed in the rural areas was 3.6 billion kwh, an 
increase of 10.4 percent. With the formation and development of 
the rural market economy, the agricultural socialized service 
system in the province was further improved, new achievements 
were made in work "revitalizing agriculture with science and 
technology," and the meteorological departments played a 
positive role in giving guidance to and serving agricultural 
production. 
  The rural economy continued to be vigorous. The output value 
of rural industries, the building industry, transportation, 
commerce, the food industry, and other nonagricultural 
production reached 31.18 billion yuan, up 30.7 percent. The 
output value of these nonagricultural sectors grew at a faster 
rate than that of agriculture and these sectors constituted more 
than half the rural economy, their proportion of the rural 
economy rising from 53.7 to 56.6 percent. In 1993, the turnover 
in rural enterprises was 36.73 billion yuan, an increase of 49.1 
percent, and their net profits were 2.82 billion yuan, up 36.9 
percent. 
<H5>  II. Industry and the Building Industry </H5>
  In 1993, industrial enterprises quickened their pace in 
changing their operational mechanism and their output and sales 
increased simultaneously. The added value of industry was 24.3 
billion yuan, 18.3 percent up, of which industries at or above 
the township level was 18.33 billion yuan, an increase of 14.3 
percent. Nonstate-owned industries developed rapidly and their 
speed of growth was markedly higher than those owned by the 
state. Of the total added value of industry, that of 
state-owned industries increased by 11.0 percent, collective 
industries increased by 27.3 percent (of which industries run by 
villages increased by 30.5 percent), and industries of other 
economic types increased by 14.3 percent. Motivated by 
investment, the growth in heavy industry was faster than that of 
light industry. The added value of heavy industry was 16.1 
billion yuan, 18.6 percent up; and the added value of light 
industry was 8.2 billion yuan, 15.4 percent up. 
  The output of heavy industry products such as the power 
industry, the raw materials industry, the building materials 
industry, and industry for turning out equipment, increased by a 
relatively big margin, while the output of some light industry 
products decreased due to factors such as market demand.

  The industrial economic results comprehensive index was 71.6 
percent, 1.1 percentage points higher than the previous year, of 
which the product marketing rate was 95.68 percent, the profit 
and tax rate of funds was 6.54 percent, the profit rate of costs 
and spending was 2.20 percent, the turnover rate of current 
assets was 1.26 times, the rate of added value of industry was 
29.9 percent, and the all-personnel labor productivity 
(calculated in terms of added value) was 8,925 yuan per person. 
  The building industry developed quite quickly, the quality 
of construction was raised, and the economic results improved. 
In 1993, with the growth of investment in fixed assets and the 
deepening reform of the building industry, the construction rate 
was quickened. Construction enterprises attained 4.8 billion 
yuan's worth of added value, 9.4 percent up. The economic 
results in state-owned building and construction enterprises 
comprehensively increased once again and the all-personnel labor 
productivity was 29,462 yuan, 76.9 percent up. The percentage 
of money-losing enterprises decreased from 18.1 to 16.9 percent. 
Profits obtained by enterprises also increased to a certain 
extent. With the increase in construction tasks, the quality of 
construction products also increased. The good quality rate of 
unit project in acceptance assessment rose from 52.0 to 65.5 
percent. 
  New progress was made in general geological surveys and 
prospecting. In 1993, the geologically prospecting system 
completed 13,000 m of mechanical core drilling. Mineral 
deposits were discovered in four new places, 38 geological 
reports of various kinds were submitted, and more deposits of 
four kinds of minerals were proven. 
<H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  The range of increase in investment in fixed assets was 
quite 
wide. The investment in fixed assets by the whole society 
amounted to 21.5 billion yuan, 50.9 percent up, of which 
investment made by state-owned units amounted to 17.3 billion 
yuan, an increase of 67.3 percent; investment made by collective 
organizations amounted to 1.2 billion yuan, an increase of 58.1 
percent; and investment made by urban and rural residents 
amounted to 3 billion yuan, an increase of 14.5 percent. 
  In the investment by state-owned units, investment in 
capital 
construction amounted to 10.1 billion yuan, 63.8 percent up; 
investment in renovation and transformation amounted to 5.6 
billion yuan, an increase of 73.3 percent; and investment in 
other fixed assets amounted to 1.6 billion yuan, an increase of 
69.1 percent. 
  The investment structure was readjusted to a certain extent 
and the basic industries and tertiary industry were 
strengthened. Of investment made by state-owned units, the 
percentage used in the renovation and transformation of 
enterprises and institutions rose from 31.7 to 35.7 percent, the 
percentage used in intensive [nei han di 0355 3211 4104] 
expansion of reproduction, improving quality of products, 
increasing varieties, and reducing energy consumption rose from 
30.8 to 32.0 percent; and the percentage used in the extensive 
[wai han di 1120 3211 4104] expansion of reproduction and 
increasing output dropped from 26.7 to 23.6 percent. In terms 
of trade, state-owned units mainly made investment in the basic 
industries and infrastructure. Investment in raw material 
industries increased by 74.6 percent; in the power industry, by 
49.8 percent; transportation, postal services, and 
telecommunications, by 97.3 percent; and agriculture decreased 
by 10.4 percent. In terms of the industrial structure, the 
percentage of investment in the tertiary industry rose from 33.9 
to 38.6 percent. 
  The speed of construction in the "project to revitalize 
Shaanxi" and in other key projects was accelerated. In 
implementing the policy of the central authorities to improve 
and strengthen macroregulation and control, the provincial 
leadership prioritized the 38 items in the implementation of the 
"project to revitalize Shaanxi" in 1993 and accelerated the 
construction progress of 22 items. The Shaanxi Historical 
Museum and the Yaoxian County Cement Plant were accepted by the 
state. Rails were laid in the 115 km section within Shaanxi of 
the Baoji-Zhongwei Railroad and the section of the Xian-Baoji 
Highway from Xian to Xingping was opened to traffic. The Weihe 
Power Plant No. 5 Generating Unit entered the installation 
stage, laying a foundation for putting the unit into operation 
in 1994. Two generating sets in the Hengshan Power Plant began 
supplying electricity to the power grid. A special railroad 
line for the Weihe Chemical Fertilizer Plant was put into 
operation and the construction of major production projects at 
the plant was started in a comprehensive manner. The 
construction of the telecommunications fiber-optic cables from 
Xian to Chengdu, from Xian to Zhengzhou, and from Xian to Yanan, 
were completed and put into operation. The capital construction 
for the production of the Aotuo mini-sedan cars and the 
renovation and transformation of equipment for the production of 
such cars were completed. The installation of equipment in two 
major workshops in the project for the production of diacetic 
acid fiber yarn began. The construction and installation work 
at the Huangling Mineral Zone Ore Dressing Plant was completed 
ahead of schedule and the commissioning stage began. Trial 
production of the Yulin Natural Gas Chemical Works began. Pipes 
were laid to transfer water from Xian's Hei He to the urban 
areas. 
<H5>  IV. Transportation, Postal and Telecommunications Services </H5>
  Transportation, postal and telecommunications services 
continued to develop steadily. The added value of 
transportation, postal and telecommunications services amounted 
to 5.2 billion yuan, 10.4 percent up, and its percentage in the 
domestic gross output value rose from 6.1 to 8.6 percent. 
However, the "bottleneck" restraint transportation causes in 
economic development was still very obvious. Although 
production of railway transportation was carefully organized, 
the shortage in transportation capacity has not yet eased. The 
sufficiency rate for rolling stock was 60 percent. The structure 
of highway transportation was quite irrational and this affected 
the utilization of the transportation capacity and the 
improvement of economic results.

  The development of the postal and telecommunications 
services 
maintained a relatively high rate of growth and was the fastest 
for many years. The total output of postal and 
telecommunications services was 710 million yuan, 44.6 percent 
up, of which mobile telephones increased by 180 percent, radio 
paging by 210 percent, and express postal services by 110 
percent. The development of long-distance telephone and urban 
telephone services was further speeded up. Sixty-four cities 
and counties were added to the long-distance telephone service 
network, 82.6 percent up. The net increase in 
program-controlled urban telephones was 234,000 sets and the 
total number of such telephones was 372,000. The proportion of 
program-controlled telephones increased from 60.9 to 87.7 
percent. Although postal and telecommunications services have 
developed quite fast in recent years, they still cannot meet the 
needs of the social and economic development. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Commerce and Market Prices </H5>
  The domestic consumer goods market was brisk. In 1993, 
establishing a new type of property rights system and further 
changing the operational mechanism were regarded as the core of 
the work in the circulation field. Greater efforts were made to 
constantly deepen reform and breakthroughs were achieved in 
developing a circulation pattern which met the needs of the 
market economy. There was an ample supply of commodities in the 
consumer goods market and buying and selling were brisk. The 
total retail sales volume of commodities in society amounted to 
27.24 billion yuan, 14.8 percent up (the actual growth was 2.7 
percent after allowing for price rises). The retail sales 
volume of consumer goods amounted to 24.55 billion yuan, an 
increase of 17.8 percent. The retail sales volume of the means 
of agricultural production amounted to 2.69 billion yuan, down 
7.2 percent. Of the retail sales volume of consumer goods, 
cities and towns accounted for 17.53 billion yuan, an increase 
of 21 percent, and rural areas accounted for 7.02 billion yuan, 
an increase of 10.6 percent. 
  The retail sales volume of commodities of various types in 
the economy grew comprehensively. The volume of state-owned 
units increased by 11.7 percent, that of collective units by 
12.1 percent, that of self-employed businessmen by 16.1 percent, 
and that of peasants to nonagricultural residents by 41.6 
percent. 
  Buying and selling was also brisk in the capital goods 
market. In the first half of last year, because of the shortage 
in resources and the increase in demand, supplies of most 
capital goods were short, their prices increased, and the 
contradiction between supply and demand was conspicuous. In the 
second half of the year, the demand dropped, prices decreased, 
and more were in stock. The purchase volume of capital goods of 
material supply and marketing enterprises amounted to 13.88 
billion yuan, 32.8 percent up; the marketing volume amounted to 
14.29 billion yuan, an increase of 26.1 percent; and the volume 
in stock increased by 24.2 percent. 
  Greater efforts were made in price reform and the situation 
whereby the prices of products from basic industries had been on 
the low side over a long period was changed to a certain extent 
and the price-forming mechanism moved another step toward the 
market. In 1993, the state removed restrictions on the prices 
for rolled steel, removed some restrictions on those for coal, 
and increased the prices of electricity and railway 
transportation. Beginning in April, the province gradually 
removed restrictions on the prices of grain and coal for 
domestic use on the market and increased the prices of chemical 
fertilizer, urban public transport charges, drinking water, the 
means of agricultural production, farmland irrigation, and the 
prices for medical services. The percentage of commodities 
whose prices were fixed by the state was further reduced and the 
price-forming mechanism was obviously improved. As a result of 
the integration of the readjustment, and removal, of 
restrictions on prices in price reform; the rise in the costs of 
production; and market supply and demand, the range of increase 
in market prices was still quite wide despite state 
macroeconomic readjustment and control. In particular, the 
range of the rise in prices in the living expenses of residents 
in large and medium-sized cities was quite wide following the 
rise in the prices or charges for grain, edible oils, rent, 
transport, schooling, and entertainment. 

    Changes in various categories of price indexes in 1993 as 
compared with 1992 are as follows (taking those for 1992 as 100):

<H5>  VII. Science, Technology, Education, Culture, Sports, and </H5>
Public Health 
  The reform of the science and technology system enhanced the

a certain extent. 
  In 1993, institutions of higher learning for adults enrolled 
28,846 undergraduate students and students studying special 
courses and had 62,192 students studying in school, 8,790 and

<H5>  VIII. Population Growth and People's Living Standards </H5>
  The rate of population growth was controlled to a certain 
extent. According to a sample survey on changes in population in 
Shaanxi in 1993, the birth rate was 17.63 per mill, the death 
rate was 6.55 per mill, and the natural growth rate was 11.08 
per mill. Based on this calculation, the total population of 
Shaanxi at the end of 1993 was 34.425 million, 379,000 more than 
the previous year. 
  The income of the residents increased by a relatively big 
margin. According to a sample survey, the per capita living 
expenses income of urban residents was 1,920 yuan, 23.0 percent 
up and, after allowing for price rises, the actual increase was 
7.9 percent. However, the growth in the income of workers and 
staff members of some enterprises whose operation was 
unsatisfactory was relatively slow. The per capita net income 
of rural residents was 653 yuan, 94.2 yuan up and an increase of 
16.9 percent. After allowing for price rises, the actual 
increase was 6.3 percent. The range of increase has been 
relatively wide in recent years. 
  New achievements were made in the reform of the labor system 
and a labor-employment system is being gradually established. 
In 1993, there were 320 employment agencies at various levels. 
In towns and cities across the province, 166,000 people were 
found jobs. At the end of the year, the proportion of people 
waiting for a job was 3 percent. The labor contract system 
developed considerably and the number of contract workers and 
staff members was 567,000, accounting for 14.4 percent of the 
total number of workers and staff members. Pension and insurance 
under unified plans of the society continued to increase and 
2.022 million workers and staff members and 397,000 retired 
personnel joined such plans. At the end of the year, there were 
3.941 million workers and staff in Shaanxi. The number of 
self-employed laborers and personnel working in private 
enterprises reached 299,000, an increase of 105,000. 
  In 1993, the total volume of wages for workers and staff 
members was 10.5 billion yuan, 10.6 percent up. The annual per 
capita wage of workers and staff members was 2,690 yuan, an 
increase of 10.5 percent. 
  The bank savings deposits by urban and rural residents 
continued to increase. At the end of 1993, the balance of the 
bank savings by residents reached 40.38 billion yuan, 7.28 
billion yuan up or an increase of 22.4 percent. 
  Insurance undertakings developed rapidly. In 1993, the 
total amount of insurance accepted on various kinds of property 
was 81.71 billion yuan, 36.6 percent up. In the whole province, 
10,000 enterprises have their property insured and 3.124 million 
households carrylife insurance. Insurance companies handled a 
total of 62,000 domestic property indemnity cases and paid 280 
million yuan in indemnity. 
  The construction of housing for urban and rural residents 
was 
speeded up. In 1993, 4.09 million square meters of new 
residences were built in towns and cities and 17.55 million 
square meters in the rural areas. 
  Social welfare continued to develop. In 1993, the number of 
beds in various kinds of welfare homes in Shaanxi reached 
15,529, accommodating 11,308 people. In urban and rural areas, 
579,000 people obtained various kinds of social relief. In the 
province, 19.7 percent of townships and towns set up a rural 
social security network. The social service networks of towns 
and cities also developed considerably and 4,532 facilities for 
various social services were built. 
  Environmental protection continued to be strengthened. In 
1993, a total of 2,204 people worked in the environmental 
protection system, with 79 environmental monitoring stations at 
various levels and four nature reserves of national class. In 
the whole year, 84 projects to prevent environmental pollution 
were completed and the total investment in these projects 
amounted to 16.2 million yuan. At the end of 1993, Shaanxi set 
up 52 smoke and dust control zones in 11 cities, with a total 
area of 237 square km, and set up 21 noise pollution control 
zones in nine cities, with a total area of 1.08 square km. 
<H5>  Notes: </H5>
  1. In accordance with the State Council's "Notice Concerning 
the Plan To Implement the New National Economy Accounting 
System" and rules on the new system of forms for reporting 
statistics to the state, relatively great changes have been made 
in the contents and index system in the 1993 communique in order 
to facilitate the overall transition to the new national economy 
accounting system and to guide the economic work to earnestly 
shift to the orbit of improving economic results. The 
communique regards domestic gross output value as the core index 
and does not list indexes such as gross social output value, and 
gross output value of industry and agriculture. 
  2. The gross domestic output value and the added value of 
various industries are the sum total of material products and 
service values usable in final consumption produced or provided 
in a certain country or region in one year. This mainly 
includes values of remuneration for laborers, profits, taxes, 
and depreciation but not transfer values of intermediate energy 
consumption or of raw materials. Therefore, they can more 
comprehensively and truly reflect the fruits of social economic 
activities. The difference between the gross domestic output 
value and the GNP is mainly that the former does not include 
foreign net factor income, but the latter does. 
  Since gross output value includes transfer values such as 
energy consumed and raw materials in the course of production, 
repeatedly calculated factors are many and, therefore, are only 
used for statistics and calculation indexes. For example, the 
total industrial gross output value in 1993 was 81.62 billion 
yuan, as calculated according to ruling prices, and was 75.4 
billion yuan, as calculated according to constant prices of 
1990, 22.4 percent up. The added value of industry was 24.3 
billion yuan, an increase of 18.3 percent. The gross output 
value of agriculture in 1993 was 23.86 billion yuan, as 
calculated according to ruling prices, and 21.78 million yuan, 
as calculated according to constant prices in 1990, 11.5 percent 
up. The added value of agriculture was 13.58 billion yuan, an 
increase of 9.6 percent. 
  3. In the communique, the gross domestic output value and 
various added value indexes for various industries are 
calculated according to ruling prices and the growth rate is 
calculated according to comparable prices.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Sichuan Provincial Statistics Bureau </F>
on 31 January 1994: "Statistical Report Issued by Sichuan 
Provincial Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social 
Development in 1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the people of Sichuan, under the 
leadership of the provincial party committee and provincial 
government, conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th 
CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, and Comrade Xiaoping's talks during his 
inspection tour of southern China. They adhered to the four 
basic principles, increased the pace of reform and opening up, 
achieved positive results in macroeconomic regulation and 
control and, on the basis of the previous year's relatively high 
growth, continued to maintain a good momentum of rapid 
development of the national economy. Further development was 
attained in science and technology, education, culture, health, 
physical culture, and other fields of social undertaking. 
According to initial statistics, the GDP for the year as a 
whole was 186.59 billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent over 
the previous year. These figure includes: An added value of 
58.27 billion yuan for primary industry, an increase of 1.1 
percent; an added value of 78.497 billion yuan for secondary 
industry, an increase of 23.1 percent; and an added value of 
49.823 billion yuan for tertiary industry, an increase of 12.3 
percent. The main problems in economic life are the high price 
increases, a credit squeeze on capital for enterprises, low 
overall efficiency levels, inadequate capacity for further 
agricultural development, and the continued prominence of 
bottlenecks restricting the development of the economy. 
<H5>  I. Primary Industry </H5>
  In 1993, the provincial party committee and provincial 
government adopted a series of policies and measures designed to 
strengthen agriculture and develop the rural economy, actively 
modified the internal structure of agriculture, made great 
efforts to develop a highly efficient agriculture providing 
larger and better yields, and accelerated the development of 
township and town enterprises. The rural economy developed 
steadily. Grain production was relatively good and forestry, 
animal husbandry, and fisheries grew steadily. For the year as a 
whole, the added value for agriculture was 58.27 billion yuan, 
an increase of 1.1 percent (total production value for 
agriculture was 84.59 billion yuan, an increase of 1.5 percent) 
including: An added value of 2.23 billion yuan for forestry, an 
increase of 5.7 percent; an added value of 20.689 billion yuan 
for animal husbandry, an increase of 5.7 percent; and an added 
value of 1.087 billion yuan for fishery, an increase of 14.6 
percent. 
  Due to the influence of natural disasters and other factors 
on crop farming, the outputs of agricultural products such as 
grain, cotton, edible oils, and cured tobacco, fell. For the 
year as a whole, the added value of crop farming was 34.264 
billion yuan, a reduction of 2.4 percent.

  Forestry production maintained its development momentum, new 
progress was achieved in forestry exploitation, and there were 
different degrees of increases in the outputs of forest 
products. For the year as a whole an area equal to 399,000 
hectares was planted with trees, thus basically maintaining the 
same level as the previous year. Of the major forest products, 
the output of tung-oil seeds reached 161,000 tonne, an increase 
of 46.8 percent and the output of Chinese chestnuts reached 
2,966 tonne, an increase of 2.5 percent. 
  Animal husbandry continued its development. The output of 
major livestock products and the livestock situation were as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Fisheries production underwent further development. The 
output of aquatic products for the whole year reached 300,100 
tonne, an increase of 9.1 percent. 
  New progress was made in the construction of basic 
infrastructure for agriculture. In every area of the province 
the masses were comprehensively mobilized to undertake the 
construction of water conservancy works. They completed a 
number of maintenance projects, such as irrigation channel 
networks, reservoir dredging, renovation, obstacle clearance, 
and strengthening which resulted in a marked success in the 
construction of water conservancy projects. An area of 
2,858,000 hectares of land throughout the province was 
effectively irrigated, representing an increase of 15,000 
hectares. At year's end: The aggregate power of farm machinery 
stood at 14 million kw, an increase of 3 percent; 47,900 trucks 
were being used for agricultural purposes, an increase of 4.1 
percent; and there was a total of 171,700 tractors of all types, 
a decrease of 1.9 percent. Chemical fertilizer usage for the 
year as a whole was 2,078,000 tonne (in terms of 100 percent 
active ingredients), an increase of 0.4 percent; the rural 
community used a total of 5.824 billion kwh of electricity, an 
increase of 11.3 percent. 
  In the rural economy, township and town enterprises 
accelerated the pace of their development. The rural industrial 
sector, construction industry, transport industry, commerce, and 
food and beverage industries achieved an increase of 77.8 
percent in output value. This was equivalent to 65.7 percent of 
the total output value of the rural community, an increase of 
12.7 percentage points. 
<H5>  II. Secondary Industry </H5>
  Industry In 1993, due to various factors such as 
the deepening of enterprise system reform and the expansion of 
the whole society's investment scope, there was a rapid increase 
in Sichuan's industrial production, the link between production 
and sales was good, and the economic efficiency improved. 
  The added value of industry was 63.982 billion yuan, an 
increase of 21 percent; sales value was 268.003 billion yuan, an 
increase of 34.7 percent; and the sales efficiency of goods 
produced was 94 percent. The added value of large and medium 
industrial enterprises was 33.5 billion yuan, an increase of 17 
percent; the sales value was 110.614 billion yuan, an increase 
of 15.4 percent; and the sales efficiency of goods produced was 
98.1 percent. 
  Output from heavy industry showed strong growth and the 
completed added value was 40.506 billion yuan, an increase of 
27.5 percent. Energy, raw materials, building materials, 
electrical and mechanical products, and so on continued to 
maintain high rates of growth. Light industry showed 
comparatively weak growth and its added value was 23.476 billion 
yuan, an increase of 12.7 percent. 
  Output of the major industrial products was as follows:

  The taxes and profits realized by industrial enterprises 
increased enormously. However, their economic efficiency still 
remained comparatively low and the number of loss-making 
enterprises and the amounts of losses continued to remain high. 
Independent accounting industrial enterprises at township level 
and above throughout the province realized 21.483 billion yuan 
in taxes and profits, an increase of 58.2 percent. This 
included 7.551 billion yuan in profits, an increase of 88.2 
percent. The rate of profits and taxes yielded by industrial 
funds and the cost-profit ratio were 10.34 and 4.57 percent 
respectively, an increase of 1.84 and 1.07 percentage points. 
However, the number of loss-making enterprises accounted fro 26 
percent of the total and total losses amounted to 3.37 billion 
yuan. 
  Construction industry In 1993, our province's 
construction industry quickened the pace of reform achieving an 
added value of 14.52 billion yuan, an increase of 35 percent. 
State construction enterprises completed construction work with 
an added value of 14.02 billion yuan, an increase of 7.1 
percent. This was equivalent to a per capita output value of 
22,640 yuan, an increase of 0.9 percent. Housing construction 
covered an area of 26.105 million square meters, with 8.618 
million square meters of buildings completed. The realized 
profit was 31.19 million yuan and the taxes paid were 174.39 
million yuan. This represented 332 yuan in per capita profits 
and taxes. 
<H5>  III. Tertiary Industry </H5>
  In 1993, all localities throughout the province seized 
opportunities to quicken the pace in the development of tertiary 
industry. This gave rise to a healthy momentum for the vigorous 
development of tertiary industry throughout the province and the 
added value of tertiary industry increased by 12.3 percent. The 
traditional industries, with transportation, post and 
telecommunications, commerce, catering trade, material supply, 
storage, finance, and insurance as the main components, 
continued to expand and the information consultancy, 
advertising, and real estate industries all grew significantly 
in strength. The number of people working in tertiary 
industries grew rapidly providing an opportunity for the 
placement of excess labor force. However, it can be seen from 
the preliminary results of a survey into the development of 
tertiary industry that the overall level of this industry in our 
province is still rather low and its share of the GDP was below 
the national average. The circulation sector was not entirely 
suited to the demands of fast economic growth and the 
restrictions caused by bottlenecks in transport, communications, 
post and telecommunications, and so on were still prominent. 
Tertiary industry developed rapidly in towns and cities but 
rather slowly in the countryside. 
  Transport, post and telecommunications In 1993 
our province's transportation industry continued to develop. 
Development in air transportation was particularly fast but 
waterborne transportation of materials into and out of the 
province and local transportation increased rather slowly. 
  Throughout the province 705 km of new roads were constructed 
and 43 new air or shipping routes opened up. 
  In 1993 the completed volume of transportation by various 
means was as follows:

  The construction of post and telecommunications expanded 
rapidly. The total volume of business for post and 
telecommunications was 1.604 billion yuan, an increase of 46.5 
percent, of which postal services increased by 16.1 percent and 
telecommunications increased by 67.3 percent. By the end of 
last year, the total number of urban telephones was 558,000, an 
increase of 47.5 percent; that of rural telephones reached 
87,000, an increase of 16 percent; and that of mobile telephones 
was 16,000, an increase of 204.2 percent. 
  Commerce and materials supply and marketing 
industry Following the gradual establishment and 
development of the socialist market economic structure, the size 
of the retail market expanded further. The total retail value of 
social commodities reached 85.46 billion yuan, an increase of 
18.8 percent. 
  Commercial enterprises of all kinds experienced increases in 
sales to varying degrees. The retail sales volume to 
nonagricultural residents by individual and private businesses 
and by peasants continued to show a momentum of rapid expansion, 
increasing by 21.5 and 32.4 percent respectively. Their share 
of the total retail market increased from the previous year's 
33.6 percent to 35.4 percent. The retail sales volume from 
state and collective enterprises grew by 15.5 percent and their 
share of the total retail market fell from 66 percent to 64.3 
percent. 
  As enterprises gradually became market oriented, the direct 
retail sales volume of industrial enterprises reached 9.27 
billion yuan, an increase of 33 percent, higher than the 
increase in any other business sector. Retail sales volume in 
the catering trade grew by 30 percent. Industrial enterprises 
and the catering trade realized a retail sales volume of 14 
billion yuan, an increase of 32.3 percent, and their share of 
the retail sales market rose from the previous year's 14.7 
percent to 16.4 percent. 
  The market for capital goods was quite brisk. Sales of all 
kinds of capital goods throughout the province by material 
supply and marketing enterprises reached 30.94 billion yuan, an 
increase of 26 percent. This included the sale of 4.221 million 
tonne of rolled steel, an increase of 23.0 percent; 6.265 
million tonne of cement, an increase of 20.1 percent; and of 
1.516 million cubic meters of timber, an increase of 2.0 percent. 
  Energy demands expanded. The consumption of all types of 
energy was equivalent to 74 million tonne of standard coal, an 
increase of 5.8 percent. 
  Finance and insurance industries The finance 
industry made further progress in 1993. In the second half of 
the year, following the state rectification of the financial 
system and the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and 
control, the financial order took a marked turn for the better. 
At the end of the year the outstanding amount of bank loans 
stood at 146.537 billion yuan, an increase of 26.88 billion yuan 
over that at the beginning of the year, or a rise of 22.4 
percent. This basically guaranteed the capital needs of key 
enterprises and projects. At the end of the year, bank deposits 
stood at 109.82 billion yuan, an increase of 16.76 billion over 
that at the beginning of the year, or a rise of 18 percent. 
  The insurance industry developed by leaps and bounds. In 
1993, insurance to the value of 143.2 billion yuan was 
underwritten to cover the property of 24,000 enterprises and the 
family property of 17.75 million urban and rural householders. 
All kinds of personal insurance to the value of 346.2 billion 
yuan was underwritten to cover 15.88 million clients. As a 
result of a variety of natural disasters and accidents, 
compensation of 920 million yuan was paid to victims, 
representing an increase of 95.7 percent. Over 334,000 people 
were provided with retirement benefits and medical insurance for 
all kinds of ailments was paid on 390,000 occasions. 
  Foreign economic relations and international 
tourism In 1993, foreign trade for the whole province 
reached $2.916 billion, an increase of 32.6 percent. This 
included $1.65 billion in export value and $1.266 billion in 
import value, an increase of 11.1 and 77.5 percent respectively. 
  Direct investment by foreign businesses continued to 
maintain 
a growth momentum. Some 2385 contracts were signed with 
foreign-funded enterprises, an increase of 78.9 percent; foreign 
investment resulting from such agreements stood at 3 billion 
yuan, an increase of 1.45 times. New contracts were signed 
covering 74 contracted overseas projects and labour service 
cooperation for a total contract value of $601 million, an 
increase of 18 percent; completed business transactions amounted 
to $356 million, an increase of 5 percent. 
  There were 290,000 foreign visitors, a decrease of 8.6 
percent; foreign exchange income from tourism was 428 million 
yuan (foreign exchange certificates), an increase of 23.1 
percent. 
  Science and technology Achievements were made in 
745 major studies in the field of natural science, including 299 
projects which received provincial-level science and technology 
advancement awards and 20 projects which received 
provincial-level spark awards. At a national level, four 
projects received science and technology advancement award, one 
received a discovery award, and four received spark awards. 
  Technology transactions achieved notable success. By year's 
end, 6,064 organizations were trading in technology, double that 
of the previous year and 95,000 people were engaged in 
technology trade activities, of whom 67,000 were professionals. 
During the year, 13,700 technology trade contracts were signed, 
with a contractual value of 1.883 billion yuan and a realized 
value of 761 million yuan, increases of 8.7, 29.8, and 84.7 
percent respectively. 
  Patent work achieved new progress with 3,464 applications 
for 
patents being made and, of these, 2,887 applications were 
approved, increases of 1.6 and 80.3 percent respectively. With 
the implementation of 164 patents there was an increase of 2.1 
billion yuan in output value and 400 million yuan in profits and 
taxes. 
  Efforts to develop agriculture and industry through 
science and technology, and to develop new and high-technology 
industries, achieved notable success. We succeeded in breeding 
26 new varieties (combinations) of farm crops, completed 
breeding and determining the fourth generation of lean-meat 
pigs; and organized the implementation of 160 Spark Plan 
projects. With the aim of developing high-quality, high-yield, 
and high-efficiency agriculture, the second round of pilot and 
demonstration projects for the comprehensive development of 
rural technology has been in full swing in 55 townships and six 
counties. Arrangements were made for the development of 851 new 
technology and product projects. The pace of building four new 
and high-technology development areas in Chengdu, Chongqing, 
Mianyang, and Zigong was speeded up. The accumulated input of 
construction capital was close to 2 billion yuan and 483 new and 
high-technology projects with foreign investment of $200 million 
moved into the area. 
  Throughout the province, there are 320 independent research 
and development institutions belonging to government departments 
at county level and above, 600 technology development 
institutions belonging to large and medium industrial 
enterprises, and 480 research and development institutions in 
universities and colleges. 
  There are also 152 learned societies covering a wide variety 
of social science topics. They undertook a total of 112 state 
assignments covered in the Eighth Five-Year Plan. 
  Overseas science and technology cooperation and exchange was 
further strengthened. There were 16 international technology 
exchange meetings and large-scale exhibitions of all types were 
held. With the aid of these exchange activities, 37 new 
ventures with a total investment of 686 million yuan, including 
317 million yuan in foreign investment, were created. 
  Education Reform of the enrollment system for 
common higher education was deepened and enrollment numbers were 
further increased. Enrollments in institutions of higher 
learning numbered 61,600, including both undergraduates and 
those studying specialized subjects, an increase of 26.9 
percent. These figures included 29,900 students trained on 
commission and self-financing students, an increase of 76.7 
percent and equivalent to 45.2 percent of the total enrollments; 
the number of students at school reached 177,900, an increase of 
18.5 percent; and graduates numbered 40,500, a reduction of 6 
percent. During the year, 2,561 postgraduate students were 
recruited, an increase of 23.1 percent; the number of 
postgraduate students reached 6,496, an increase of 8.2 percent; 
and there was a total of 1,752 research students who graduated, 
an increase of 11.6 percent. 
  Some breakthroughs were made in restructuring middle school 
education. Some 598,000 students attended all kinds of 
vocational and technical schools, an increase of 11.2 percent, 
representing 56.4 percent of the total senior middle school 
student population. 
  Common educational activities achieved new progress once 
again. There were 2,891,000 students attending junior middle 
school. The propoprtion of school-age children attending 
primary schools rose from the previous year's 97.4 percent to 
97.7 percent and the proportion of students entering schools of 
a higher grade rose from the previous year's 76.3 percent to 
81.6 percent. There were 9,163,200 primary school students, an 
increase of 4.3 percent. Primary education was made universally 
available in 184 counties (cities and districts). There were 
2,103,000 children attending 14,000 kindergartens. Schools run 
by local people continued to develop, with 111,600 children 
attending private primary and secondary schools and 
kindergartens. Special education was further strengthened and 
5,200 physically disadvantaged pupils attended special schools. 
  Adult education developed steadily. Enrollments at all kinds 
of adult education centers of higher learning numbered 39,000, 
basically equaling the previous year's figure. There were 
91,300 students attending classes, an increase of 9.4 percent 
and 24,100 students graduated, an increase of 5.1 percent. Some 
70,500 students were enrolled in adult secondary professional 
schools, an increase of 62.8 percent; there were 160,900 
students in such schools, an increase of 30.4 percent; and 
27,500 students graduated, an increase of 9.3 percent. There 
were 440,000 university or college examinations undertaken by 
students studying independently and, of these, 12,000 attained 
university or college qualifications. Peasant cultural and 
technical schools of all types increased to 34,500 
establishments, with an attendance of 5,443,100. Elementary 
schooling for adults also made significant progress. The number 
of people attending systematic and short-term adult technical 
training courses was 6.18 million and 537,300 cases of 
illiteracy were rectified. 
  The number of teachers with formal qualifications rose. In 
regular colleges and universities, the number of teachers with 
high-level professional titles accounted for 32.6 percent of the 
total number of full-time teachers, an increase of 5 percentage 
points over the previous year; the number of senior, junior 
middle school, and primary school teachers coming up to the 
standard in terms of educational background reached 56.1, 55.8, 
and 82.1 percent respectively. 
  Culture, radio broadcasting, television, news 
publishing In 1993, there were 2,334 film projection units, 
145 performing art troupes, 160 public libraries, 210 cultural 
centers, 46 museums, and 300 archives, of which 236 were state 
comprehensive archives. There were 29 radio stations with 38 
separate programs, covering 70.4 percent of the population. 
There were 28 television stations showing 31 separate programs, 
3,522 television transmitting and relay stations, and 6,403 
satellite ground stations, providing television coverage for 
75.2 percent of the population. During the year, the 1993 
Sichuan International Television Festival was held successfully. 
Nine new movies were made, 156 new films of all types were 
released, and six radio plays consisting of 66 episodes and 53 
television plays consisting of 194 episodes were recorded. A 
large batch of literary and art works, movies, and television 
programs emerged like "China Has Brought Forth a Mao Zedong." 
There were 116 local newspapers with a total circulation of 
1.47 billion copies, 379 magazines with a total circulation of 
72.98 million copies, and 4,300 different books with a total of 
433.75 million copies printed. 
  Health Medical and health services continued to 
improve. There were 19,062 medical institutions; 256,500 
hospital beds, an increase of 14.9 percent; and 319,300 health 
workers, including 156,500 doctors and 67,300 senior and junior 
nurses. There were 72,000 village medical centers and 121,000 
rural doctors and medical staff. There was a decline in the 
incidence of category 1 and 2 infectious diseases and of leprosy 
and success was achieved in the prevention and treatment of 
endemic diseases. The coverage rate of infant inoculation as 
part of the planned immunization program reached 92.4 percent. 
  Environmental protection Environmental quality 
took a turn for the better. The coverage rate for the treatment 
of industrial gases reached 71.9 percent, for waste water 48.5 
percent, and for solids 52.6 percent. 
  Sports Provincial athletes won 14 gold, 3 silver, 
and 2 bronze medals in international sporting competitions. In 
national competitions they won 29 gold, 23 silver, and 28 bronze 
medals. During the year the jointly administered 7th National 
Games was a complete success. During the games our province's 
fine athletes made notable achievements. They won 18 gold, 16 
silver, and 22 bronze medals and placed fifth in the overall 
team competition, one place higher than that achieved at the 
last games. Sports run by local people and schools developed 
steadily, with 13 counties being awarded as national advanced 
counties and 66 counties assessed as winners at the provincial 
level. The "Standards for Student Physical Training" were 
applied throughout 93.2 percent of the province, achieving a 
pass rate of 86.9 percent. 
<H5>  IV. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  In 1993 our province's total investment increased, the 
investment composition underwent some adjustment, work on key 
construction projects went on solidly, and construction of basic 
industries and infrastructure was strengthened. The total fixed 
asset investment reached 54.508 billion yuan, an increase of 
34.5 percent, including 41.621 billion yuan in local investment, 
an increase of 36.9 percent. 
  Capital construction investment by state-owned units was 
22.188 billion yuan, an increase of 37.8 percent. From the 
composition of investments it can be seen that the increase of 
investment in tertiary industry was clearly faster than that of 
investment in the primary and secondary industries. Investment 
in primary industry such as agriculture, forestry, animal 
husbandry, fishery, and water conservancy was 570 million yuan, 
a decline of 17.9 percent; investment in secondary industry such 
as the industrial sector and the construction industry was 
10.786 billion yuan, an increase of 24.9 percent; and investment 
in tertiary industry was 10.832 billion yuan, an increase of 
60.2 percent, including 3.198 billion yuan of investment in 
transport and post and telecommunications, an increase of 110 
percent. Investment in 67 large and medium capital construction 
projects was 7.523 billion yuan, accounting for 33.6 percent of 
the total investment in infrastructure projects. 
  Major projects begun in 1993 included: The Chengdu-Daxian 
Electrified Railroad Project, the western circular line of the 
Chengdu transport hub, Chengdu's Shuangliu Airport, the Fuling 
Long He-Shiban Hydroelectric Power Station, the Daqiao 
Reservoir, the Chuandong Chlorine and Alkali Project, the 
Sichuan Polyester Project, the Huatong Automobile Group's 
renovation and expansion project at Deyang, and so on. During 
the year the Zigong City Changshan Salt Mine, Xinan Jiaotong 
University, and Chengdu Rolling Stock Plant were completed and 
put into production. 
  Through capital construction, the newly increased capacity 
and efficiency in 1993 included: Some 480,000 tonnes of raw 
coal, 610,000 kw of generated power, 534,000 tonnes of cement, 
288 km of new highways, 390.6 km of newly renovated highways, 
62,086 automatic telephone exchanges in cities, 153,700 tonnes 
of stored grain, and 261 commercial service enterprises. 
  In 1993, 11.411 billion yuan was invested in the renovation 
and improvement of state-owned units, an increase of 35 percent, 
including 8.164 billion yuan by the localities, an increase of 
31.6 percent. 
  V. Prices 
  In 1993, prices moved further from their relative high point 
and the dynamics of price reform increased the continued upward 
movement of prices from their high levels. The overall level of 
retail prices for social goods rose by 13.5 percent. The retail 
prices of commodities in towns and cities and in rural areas all 
saw dramatic increases, rising by 14.4 percent in towns and 
cities and by 13.3 percent in rural areas. The prices of food 
products rose across the board by 16.5 percent and the prices of 
the means of agricultural production increased significantly by 
14.8 percent. These were the main factors in propelling the 
increases in retail prices. 
  The prices of essential services for which residents have to 
pay increased markedly higher than those of consumer goods. The 
cost of services was frequently readjusted and, rising by 35.2 
percent, 21.8 percentage points more than for consumer products. 
  Due to the fact that grain prices were liberalized and that 
there was a shortage in the supply of live pigs in the market, 
the overall level of purchase prices for agricultural products 
increased by 15.9 percent. This included an increase of 27.9 
percent in the purchase price of grain and an increase of 23.4 
percent in poultry and animal product prices; the prices of 
other categories of products rose by less than 15 percent, lower 
than the agricultural products purchase price index. 
<H5>  VI. Population and Living Standards </H5>
  In 1993, the work of controlling population growth yielded 
results. According to a sample survey on population changes 
carried out in 30 counties (cities and districts), Sichuan's 
birthrate was 16.77 per mill and the death rate 7.2 per mill, 
giving a natural population growth rate of 9.57 per mill. 
  The actual income of urban residents increased and their 
consumption levels were higher. According to a sample survey 
conducted among 2,000 households in 20 cities and counties, the 
per capita living expense currency income of urban dwellers was 
2,173 yuan in 1993, an increase of 20.2 percent. Taking into 
account price increase factors, actual income rose by 3.1 
percent. Per capita consumer spending was 2,034 yuan, an 
increase of 21.9 percent (with price increase factors, the 
actual raise was 4.4 percent). This included an 18.5 percent 
increase in food consumption; a 23.9 percent increase in 
clothing and footwear consumption; a 24.4 percent increase in 
the cost of household appliances, daily necessities, and 
services; a 19.2 percent increase in medical and health 
protection costs; an 80.6 percent increase in transport and 
communications outlay; a 47.8 percent increase in the education 
costs; and a 22.4 percent increase in residential expenses. 
  According to a sample survey conducted among 5,500 rural 
households in 55 counties, the per capita net income of peasants 
in Sichuan was 695 yuan, an increase of 9.6 percent. Taking 
into account price increase factors, this represented a decline 
of 3.4 percent in actual income; per capita living expenditure 
was 647 yuan, an increase of 13.7 percent (with price increase 
factors, this represents an actual decline of 0.3 percent). 
This included a 16.1 percent increase in foodstuff consumption, 
a 12.6 percent increase in the cost of daily necessities, and a 
37.1 percent increase in the cost of noncommodities. 
  The total number of staff remained at the same level as the 
previous year and the staff salaries continued to increase. In 
1993 there were 9,811,400 employees throughout the province and 
placements were found for 258,000 people in cities and towns. 
By the end of 1993, there were 5,140 private enterprises 
employing 87,200 people in cities and towns, increases of 3,077 
enterprises and 60,000 people respectively. In cities and towns 
there were a total of 540,000 self-employed laborers, an 
increase of 56,600. The staff payroll totalled 27.729 billion 
yuan in 1993, an increase of 16.5 percent. 
  The personal savings of urban and rural residents increased. 
At the end of 1993 their savings totalled 71.35 billion yuan, 
an increase of 13.256 billion yuan or 22.8 percent. 
  There were improvements to the living conditions of urban 
and 
rural residents. For the year as a whole, 15,811,500 square 
meters of residential space was constructed in cities and towns; 
urban residents had an average of 7.2 square meters of living 
space each, an increase of 0.2 square meres. In the rural 
areas, 39,366,700 square meters of residential accommodation was 
built. 
  The social security system was further developed and 
perfected. More and more workers and staff members in urban 
enterprises were covered by the social endowment insurance 
schemes. In 1993, 31,999 urban enterprises, covering 5.28 
million service workers and 1.35 million retired workers, 
participated in the provincial-level endowment insurance scheme. 
In cities, 6,791 community service facilities were established 
in the cities. There were 79,300 beds belonging to social 
welfare units and 56,600 people were being cared for. By the 
end of 1993, 721 townships (towns) had established social 
security networks and there were 4,444 social security trusts 
with 115 million yuan in funds. There were 3,751,900 social 
relief payouts and 251,200 people were collectively provided 
with food, clothing, medical care, housing, and funeral expenses 
to a total of 10.19 million yuan. 
  VII. National Autonomous Regions 
  In 1993, the national autonomous regions continued to 
conscientiously implemented the "Law of Regional National 
Autonomy," increased the weight of reform, and promoted 
development with reform. As a result, the national economy 
continued to expand, social undertakings enjoyed all-round 
development, people's standard of living was further improved, 
and the social situation of all nationalities uniting and living 
stably together continued to be consolidated. The GDP of Garze, 
Aba, and Liangshan Autonomous Prefectures, together with 
Qianjiang Prefecture, Mabian County, and Ebian County amounted 
to 11.045 billion yuan, an increase of 10.8 percent. This 
included 4.811 billion yuan in the added value of primary 
industry, an increase of 4.6 percent; 34.58 billion yuan in the 
added value of secondary industry, an increase of 14.4 percent; 
and 2.776 billion yuan in the added value of tertiary industry, 
an increase of 19.9 percent. 
  Agricultural production continued to be strengthened. In 
1993 the total output value for agriculture was 6.19 billion 
yuan, an increase of 5.5 percent. With the exception of sugar 
cane and oil-bearing crops, the output of all agricultural 
products increased.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Agricultural production conditions further improved. At the 
end of 1993, the aggregate power of farm machinery was 1.218 
billion watts, an increase of 10.5 percent; chemical fertilizer 
usage for the year amounted to 121,000 tonne (in terms of 100 
percent active ingredients), an increase of 2.3 percent; and the 
rural consumption of electricity was 342 million kwh, an 
increase of 14.4 percent. 
  Industrial production continued to develop. Collective 
industrial enterprises developed faster that state-owned 
industrial enterprises and light industry developed faster than 
heavy industry. Industrial output value amounted to 7.461 
billion yuan, an increase of 20.8 percent. This included 5.041 
billion yuan in the output value of state-owned industrial 
enterprises, an increase of 11.6 percent, and 1.332 billion yuan 
in the output value of collective industrial enterprises, an 
increase of 43.1 percent. Of the total industrial output value, 
light industrial output value was 2.982 billion yuan, an 
increase of 24.1 percent, and heavy industrial output value was 
4.479 billion yuan, an increase of 18.7 percent. 
  Investment continued to grow. Fixed assets investment by 
state-owned units amounted to 1.611 billion yuan, an increase of 
21.6 percent. This included 1.176 billion yuan in capital 
construction investment, an increase of 15.1 percent, and 388 
million yuan in renovating and upgrading investment, an increase 
of 51.2 percent. 
  Business was brisk and the people's standard of living 
improved. The total retail sales value of social consumer items 
was 3.754 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent. This 
included 1.748 billion yuan in retail sales by state-owned 
economic units, an increase of 15.1 percent, and 553 million 
yuan in retail sales by collective economic units, an increase 
of 7.5 percent. The retail sales value of the means of 
agricultural production was 452 million yuan, an increase of 1.9 
percent. At the end of 1993, the savings deposits of urban and 
rural residents was 3.305 billion yuan, an increase of 16.9 
percent. This included 2.42 billion yuan in savings deposits by 
urban residents, an increase of 15.2 percent. 
  Notes: 1. Differentiation of the three categories of 
industry: Primary industry refers to agriculture, secondary 
industry refers to the industrial sector and construction 
industry, and tertiary industry refers to all trades other than 
the primary and secondary industries. This can be specifically 
divided into four levels: 
  First: The distribution sector, including the transport and 
communications industries, post and telecommunications, 
commerce, catering industries, material supply and marketing 
industry, and storage industry; 
  Second: The sector in the service of production and 
livelihood, including the financial and insurance industries, 
the comprehensive technical service industry, the agricultural, 
forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and water conservancy 
service industries, and water conservancy industry, consultation 
service industry, highway and inland river (lake) lane 
maintenance industry, geographical survey industry, residents' 
service industry, public utilities, real estate industries, and 
so on; 
  Third: Service sectors for scientific and cultural 
advancement and for improving the quality of life, including 
education, culture, radio and television, scientific research, 
medical services, sports, and social service facilities; and 
  Fourth: Sectors for the provision of public services, 
including state, party, and government organs, mass 
organizations, as well as the military and police. 
  2. The GDP is the sum of the added value of all trades and 
professions in the national economy. Added value is the 
increase in value arising out of the production of goods or 
provision of services. It is also known as additional value and 
is made up of four constituent parts, namely: Laborers' 
remuneration, depreciation on fixed assets, net amount of 
production taxes, and operation surplus. 
  3. Due to slight changes in statistical specifications, the 
per capita living expenditure currency income indicator for 
urban residents is calculated in accordance with new 
requirements and comparison with the previous year's growth rate 
was calculated in accordance with the same specifications. 
  4. The GDP and other output value indicators quoted in this 
communique are calculated in accordance with the prices 
prevailing in that particular year and comparison with the 
previous year's rate of growth is calculated in accordance with 
comparable prices. 
  5. All data in this communique are preliminary annual 
statistics.

<F P=106> [By Queenie Wang] </F>
  [Text] Pro-Beijing Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) 
members have accused China of making concessions over airport 
financial arrangements in exchange for a deal with the British 
in the defence land talks. ACC members expressed disappointment 
with the draft agreement on funding for Chek Lap Kok being drawn 
up for signing within the next few days. They say it fails to 
clarify grey areas in the new airport Memorandum Of 
Understanding (MOU) and fear overspending on the project may 
cause rows in the future. 
  Some ACC members have already taken their grievances to 
Chinese members of the Airport Committee. The group is unhappy 
that Beijing appears to have accepted the arrangement proposed 
by the British without securing an agreement on setting up an 
independent body to monitor progress on the project. "Hong Kong 
people should welcome this agreement but the mechanism for 
monitoring the expense progress and quality of the project needs 
further discussion," ACC member Ho King-on said. 
  Other members were harsher in their criticism of the deal, 
claiming it contained many loopholes. They said that, during 
their private meeting, Chinese official Hu Houcheng failed to 
give a satisfactory explanation for giving in to British 
demands, admitting only that there were many "problems" in the 
draft deal. "This is a disappointing result. They broke the 
deadlock which had lasted for two years but did not clarify the 
grey areas in the MOU. This is dangerous," one ACC member said. 
"We all understand that they (the Chinese) did so because they 
got advantages over defence land -- they mixed the two issues 
up." 
  ACC members were disappointed China accepted a level of debt 
far above the $5 billion ceiling stated in the MOU without 
seeking more cash reserves to be left for the Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) government. "The British have only 
promised to leave at least $25 billion for the SAR government. 
Now the British increase the debt level, why don't they 
increase the reserve to make it more comfortable?" one member 
said. But ACC chairman Wong Po-yan did not share the anger, 
saying he hoped the agreement would be finalised soon. 
  Britain is already planning to rush any agreement through 
the 
Legislative Council before the summer recess. The last Finance 
Committee of the session is scheduled for July 8, but a later 
one may be arranged if necessary. Legislators would be asked to 
approve a $60.3 billion equity injection, with $36.6 billion 
destined for the Provisional Airport Authority, and $23.7 
billion for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC]. Much 
of this has already been voted through, and a further $15 
billion is up for approval at Friday's Finance Committee 
meeting. However, none of the money for MTRC has been put to 
the Legislative Council.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hopefully, Agreement on New Airport Financial </F>
Arrangements Will Be Reached"] 
  [Text] After a three-and-half-hour meeting of the 
Sino-British Airport Committee yesterday, the two sides 
simultaneously announced that experts will be entrusted with 
preparing a summary of the meeting, which the chief negotiators 
of the two sides will sign, and which will serve as an agreement 
on the new airport financing deal reached between the two sides. 
This shows that comparatively great progress was made at 
yesterday's meeting; hopefully, a comprehensive agreement on the 
new airport financial arrangements will be reached. 
  In answering reporters' questions, the Chinese team leader 
Guo Fengmin stated: "The accomplishments scored by the two 
sides are the result of their common efforts." What gives much 
food for thought is that here, Guo Fengmin laid special stress 
on the two characters "both sides." Doing a good job of 
handling important matters during Hong Kong's transition is a 
responsibility shared by both the Chinese and British sides, and 
calls for common efforts; only then will it be possible to score 
results satisfactory to both sides. If only one side shows 
sincerity, but the other side not; if only one side hopes for 
cooperation, but the other side goes its own way; some simple 
issues will become complicated, whereas complicated issues will 
become increasingly so. 
  The new airport issue is one that has already been settled, 
and not a complicated one at that. After eight months of 
negotiation, they signed a memorandum of understanding on 
building a new airport and related issues back in 1991, with 
explicit rules on some basic principles and important specific 
issues. So long as the British Hong Kong Government takes up 
its responsibility, and does business earnestly in accordance 
with the memorandum of understanding, the new airport project 
will fold smoothly, and Mr. Chris Patten will be sure to return 
to London from the Lantau Island airport on 30 June 1997. 
However, the British side has created side issues by setting 
out financial arrangements in violation of the memorandum; in 
addition, it has unilaterally and repeatedly made financial 
allotments based on such arrangements; thus an issue that has 
already been settled was once again placed on the table, and the 
talks have continued on and off for more than two years. 
  The building of a new airport aims to help Hong Kong's 
development; the Chinese side has all along adopted a positive 
attitude, which is given full play in the memorandum. However, 
the building of a new airport involves huge funds; the Chinese 
side must show concern over costs and economic returns as well 
as the finances of the future Hong Kong SAR [Special 
Administrative Region] Government. While negotiations were 
under way before the signing of the memorandum, the British side 
proposed leaving only a HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
financial reserve to the HK SAR Government; whereas the Chinese 
side argued strongly on just grounds, and fought for every 
additional penny; with great efforts, the two sides reached an 
agreement on HK $25 billion. To avoid leaving a heavy financial 
burden on the SAR Government from loans to build the airport, 
the two sides agreed that the debts left over to the SAR 
Government should not exceed HK$5 billion; if the amount of 
debts exceeds that sum, the matter must first be negotiated 
between the two sides. The future Hong Kong SAR Government will 
be totally independent financially, and the Chinese Government 
will not take one cent away from it. Now, on the new airport 
issue, the Chinese side shows special concern about and insists 
on the two figures, HK$25 billion and HK$5 billion, out of 
consideration for a sound financial basis for the Hong Kong SAR 
Government so that SAR taxpayers will be spared additional 
burden. 
  The question lies in the fact that the British side has 
failed to perform its commitment in the memorandum of 
understanding and show consideration for Hong Kong's future, but 
always attempted to acquire as much money as possible for its 
motherland through building the new airport. Consequently, a 
financial plan by which "the British Hong Kong Government takes 
out loans, the SAR Government will repay the debts" surfaced. 
According to the first plan, some HK$70 billion loan would be 
taken out, which was around 15 times greater than the sum 
stipulated in the memorandum, equivalent to approximately three 
times the total of the financial reserve to be left to the SAR 
Government. The third plan would still involve a loan of some 
HK$40 billion. And the fourth plan would take out some HK $23 
million, 4.7 times the sum stipulated in the Memorandum. On the 
one hand, the British Hong Kong Government would leave the Hong 
Kong SAR Government HK $25 billion financial reserve; on the 
other, it would leave the SAR Government a debt of some HK $23 
billion. Is it not true that the British Hong Kong side 
attempts to make things very difficult for the SAR Government? 
How can Hong Kong residents agree to that? 
  The arguments between the two sides over the new airport has 
all along centered around the issue of whether or not 
consideration should be shown for Hong Kong residents. 
Representing Hong Kong residents' interests, the Chinese side 
has engaged in talks with the British side for two years or so; 
it has persisted in principle, while expressing extremely great 
patience and due flexibility. On the issue of taking out loans, 
the Chinese side has actually handled the matter with some 
flexibility. Based on the stipulation in the memorandum that 
"taking out any loans exceeding the sum of HK$5 billion must 
first acquire unanimous agreement of the two sides to the 
proposal on making the loan," the Chinese side is willing to 
conduct truth-seeking discussions with the British side to seek 
a rational settlement. 
  We may put it that in discussing the issue of the new 
airport financial arrangements, the Chinese side has already 
shown great sincerity and exerted very great efforts. So long 
as the British side is willing to cooperate and show 
consideration for Hong Kong residents' interests, it will not be 
difficult to settle the differences. The Sino-British Airport 
Committee's discussion on the new airport financial arrangements 
held yesterday has made pleasing progress. We believe that the 
British side has also exerted some efforts. 
  However, experts of the two sides will continue to contact 
each other in drafting a summary of the meeting, and a 
comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial 
arrangements is yet to come. From the statements by team leaders 
of both sides yesterday, we can see that the two sides have 
reached common understanding on some basic issues; however, 
"there are sill some specific issues and wording to be studied," 
which calls for the common efforts of experts from both sides. 
We hope that the two sides will show mutual understanding and 
make concessions to each other in studying specific issues and 
wording, while bearing Hong Kong residents' interests in mind to 
complete the drafting of the summary as quickly as possible. 
  Even if the two sides reach an agreement on the new airport 
financial arrangements, it only means that a solution to 
implementing one aspect of the memorandum is found. In handling 
all sorts of issues related to the new airport, the spirit of 
the memorandum and the principle of cost and economic returns, 
as well as avoiding burden to the SAR Government should persist. 
From now on, in handling all important issues straddling 30 
June 1997 in relation with the airport project, such as the 
establishment of the airport administration and advisory 
committee, both sides should conduct negotiations in accordance 
with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the memorandum in 
the spirit of cooperation. Any behavior in violation of 
commitment and trampling the agreement will jeopardize the 
building of the new airport and Hong Kong residents' long-range 
interests.

<F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent Zhao Wen (6392 2429): "Early </F>
Agreement From the Sino-British Airport Committee Desired"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 23 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The 
Sino-British Airport Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting on 
24 June on financial arrangements for the new airport. Hong 
Kong society is hoping that this meeting can produce substantive 
results and an agreement to enable the airport construction to 
go ahead and to be completed on schedule. 
  Signs show that after rounds of in-depth negotiations, China 
and Britain are narrowing their differences over the financial 
arrangements for the new airport. Concerned personnel from both 
sides are expressing optimism about the meeting. Therefore, if 
both sides take the Airport Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] as 
the point of departure, and continue to negotiate frankly and 
sincerely and with an attitude of seeking truth from facts, it 
is possible that the meeting can achieve a breakthrough or even 
a package deal. 
  A member of the Airport Consultative Committee said in his 
analysis that there are still three main differences between 
China and Britain over financial arrangements for the new 
airport: One, the amount of debt; two, whether the debts of the 
airport corporation and airport railway corporation should be 
counted as borrowings by the Hong Kong Government; and three, 
whether the land along the Airport Railway should be 
incorporated into the annual land sale scheme of the 
Sino-British Land Committee. 
  The Airport MOU expressly sets the debt for the new airport 
at 5 billion Hong Kong dollars, and consultation with China is 
required if the debt exceeds this amount. To reach an early 
agreement, China has stated more than once that the 5 billion 
was not an absolute ceiling, showing fully its flexibility and 
pragmatic attitude. If the financial arrangement proposed by 
Britain is not too wide of the mark, it should not be difficult 
to bridge the difference here. On whether the debts of the 
airport corporation and airport railway corporation should be 
counted as Hong Kong Government borrowings, there should not be 
any question that they are, because both companies are 
organizations dependent on and wholly funded by the Hong Kong 
Government, which should shoulder all their debts. It is 
doubtful whether the two companies could even obtain consortium 
loans if statements were put out that the Hong Kong Government 
had nothing to do with their debts. 
  The answer to the question of whether the land along the 
airport railway should be included in the annual land sale 
scheme of the Sino-British Land Committee is in the affirmative. 
Anson Chan, chief secretary of the Hong Kong Government, said 
earlier that Britain had never suggested disposing of all this 
land in one sale and agreed to incorporating it in the land 
committee's annual land sale scheme. Therefore, there is not 
much difference between China and Britain on this issue. 
  To sum up, if at this meeting both sides are more sincere 
and 
continue to negotiate with an attitude of seeking truth from 
facts and in a conciliatory and concessionary spirit, they 
should achieve substantive results and reach an agreement, and 
lay the foundation for the administrative structure and other 
systems of the new airport.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten: "Why My </F>
Reforms Are Right"] 
  [Text] This Wednesday the Legislative Council will be 
asked to make one of the most important decisions in Hong Kong's 
150-year history. After almost two years of debate in the 
community, in the Legislative Council chamber and across the 
negotiating table, the time has come to decide exactly how we 
are going to conduct the elections due in the autumn of this 
year and next. Despite some ungracious language in the columns 
of one or two of the minority- interest newspapers, the debate 
has been characterised more by common sense than controversy, 
more by rational discussion than by rhetoric. Few communities 
would have conducted such an important debate with such 
restraint. But I now detect a weariness. A feeling of "OK, we 
have had the debate, there is nothing more to be said, now let's 
make up our minds and get on with it". 
  In essence, the Legislative Council will be asked to provide 
answers to two fundamental questions: 
  -- Should our electoral arrangements be consistent with the 
Basic Law or should we move immediately to a fully directly 
elected Legislative Council in 1995? This is the issue at stake 
with the bill to be proposed by Emily Lau Wai-hing. 
  -- Should the 1994 and 1995 elections be open and fair or 
should we adopt arrangements which, to put it gently, remove 
some of the uncertainty from the outcome of the democratic 
process? This is the issue at stake when the Government's bill 
and the Liberal Party's amendments are debated. 
  The Government's position on these two fundamental questions 
is unequivocal, unambiguous and unanything else the conspiracy 
theorists care to name. It has been suggested that we are 
somehow conniving to water down our own proposals. But let me 
make it clear what we have been saying to members of the 
Legislative Council for months. The Government will go on 
lobbying and arguing for the proposals contained in its bill and 
at the end of the debate on Wednesday you will find the three 
official members of the council leading the voting in favour of 
the bill. 
  The case for the Government's proposals is compelling. 
  -- Our proposals are consistent with the Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law. No one has been able to point to a single 
instance in which they offend against either document. On the 
contrary, independent legal opinion has confirmed that they meet 
the requirements of both. China would therefore have no reason 
to change the composition of the legislature in 1997. 
  -- They have received widespread support in the community. I 
do not think anyone seriously doubts that they provide for free 
and fair elections and that they would command the confidence of 
the community. 
  -- They would be workable because we would be able to define 
electorates, draw up voting registers and conduct the elections 
efficiently. In contrast, there are serious doubts about the 
fairness of the arrangements proposed by the Liberal Party. 
Their practicability has also not been established. 
  -- The Government's proposals have another great advantage. 
They will allow Hong Kong to move on from the debate about 
electoral arrangements, while both the Liberal Party amendments 
and the Emily Lau bill would simply prolong it. 
  -- It is quite simply an illusion to assume that a vote for 
the Liberal Party amendments is a vote for political harmony and 
a quiet life until 1997. 
  Almost every directly-elected member of the Legislative 
Council regards the Government's proposals as the absolute 
minimum they could accept. Does anyone really expect them to 
acquiesce in the drastically watered-down version which the 
Liberal Party wants us to accept? Would passing the Emily Lau 
bill actually bring the debate to a close? Does the community 
really want electoral arrangements which are so clearly at odds 
with the Basic Law? 
  The council's debate this week will be long and complex. 
Members will have to work their way through the details of the 
functional constituencies and the election committee. But the 
details matter: 
  -- Are we to rectify the faults with the existing functional 
constituencies by expanding their franchises and bringing in a 
breath of democratic fresh air? Our proposals would raise the 
electorate in these constituencies from 110,000 to 185,000. 
  -- Can we insulate the nine new functional constituencies 
against corruption and unfairness right from the start by making 
them more broadly-based and representative of everyone employed 
in the major sectors of the economy. [punctuation as published] 
Our proposals provide for a franchise of up to 2.5 million in 
the nine new constituencies. 
  -- Is the election committee to be composed of people 
genuinely elected in Hong Kong and will its internal voting 
procedures be fair? 
  Our proposals would result in an election committee made up 
of all of the elected members of the district boards. The 
single transferable vote system we have devised would ensure 
that the seats are allocated in proportion to the preferences of 
the electors. 
  Meanwhile, the Liberal Party's answer to all of these 
questions is "no". Their amendments would not enhance the 
credibility of the electoral process. For example, their 
proposals for the nine new functional constituencies would 
result in a maximum franchise of only about 120,000. Their 
proposals are heavily weighted in favour of employers and 
professionals. They give no recognition to the contribution of 
the great mass of men and women who make our economy the 
outstanding success that it is. If the Liberal Party's 
amendments were passed, the result would be that the great 
majority of Hong Kong's working population would be represented 
in only four of the 30 functional constituencies. 
  Some of the new functional constituencies proposed by the 
Government's opponents seem to have more to do with protecting 
vested interests than producing fair electoral arrangements. 
For example, why propose a functional constituency limited to 
retailers when the closely-related wholesale sector has an 
equally strong case for inclusion? Why is the Liberal Party 
proposing a new insurance functional constituency when the 
insurance industry is already covered in the financial services 
functional constituency? 
  The Government's opponents' amendments on the election 
committee display a similar reluctance to accept the community's 
desire for openness and fairness. They have proposed a 
first-past-the-post voting arrangement which could result in any 
political group which could control a mere 50 per cent of the 
votes winning a full 100 per cent of the seats! The 
Government's proposals were drawn up after our consultations in 
Hong Kong made it clear that the community wanted open and fair 
electoral arrangements and that it wanted these arrangements to 
be consistent with the Basic Law. That is exactly what the 
Government's bill would achieve. We shall go on making the case 
for these proposals because we believe that the people of Hong 
Kong want and deserve electoral arrangements which offer them a 
genuine choice. We believe that the integrity of the electoral 
process matters because Hong Kong needs a credible Legislative 
Council if the rights and freedoms described in the Joint 
Declaration are to be preserved. 
  Ultimately, the decision rests with the Legislative Council. 
That is right and proper. The electoral arrangements are a 
matter of enacting new laws and it is, after all, the 
Legislative Council's role to enact our laws. But members will 
be well aware that they will be making a decision on behalf of 
the whole community.

<F P=106> ["Independent view from Emily Lau Wai-hing," directly </F>
elected independent legislative councillor for the New 
Territories East constituency: "Courage Needed To Keep 
Autonomy"] 
  [Text] For the first time in 150 years of British colonial 
rule the legislature has a chance to vote on the Hong Kong 
Government's electoral reform package: I hope members will have 
the moral courage to do the right thing for Hong Kong. 
  In moving the first and second reading of my private 
member's 
bill -- the Electoral Provisions (Miscellaneous Amendment) (No 
3) Bill 1994 -- on June 1, I sought to implement a pledge I made 
when I stood for direct election in September 1991, that is, I 
would fight for a fully directly-elected Legislative Council. 
  To the British Government, Hong Kong people's demand for 
democracy was a bargaining chip in negotiations with China to 
help Britain secure economic benefits, as was demonstrated in 
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant and the new airport. Britain 
probably would not go out of its way to harm Hong Kong's 
interests, but when conflicts of interest arise, Hong Kong would 
inevitably lose out. 
  In 1984, Beijing and London foisted the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration on the Hong Kong people. It stipulated that the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) legislature would 
be constituted by elections and the SAR would have a high degree 
of autonomy. 
  My bill is fully in line with the Joint Declaration and 
provides for an important element in safeguarding the high 
degree of autonomy which was promised. It is also in accordance 
with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. I admit my bill 
violates the Basic Law stipulation that only 20 of 60 
Legislative Council [Legco] seats should be directly elected in 
1997, but the Basic Law only comes into force in 1997 and my 
bill is about elections in 1995. Furthermore, since Beijing has 
vowed to dismantle the Council in 1997 no matter how it is 
constituted, concern for the so-called political through train 
is irrelevant. The Basic Law, like the Joint Declaration, was 
imposed on the powerless Hong Kong people in 1990. Given a 
choice, I believe many would support universal suffrage rather 
than a hopelessly complicated hybrid system. 
  To coincide with the Joint Declaration, the British 
administration published a White Paper in November 1984 stating 
that Hong Kong would make "a gradual start by introducing a very 
small number of directly-elected seats in 1988 and building up 
to a significant number of directly-elected seats by 1997". In 
November 1985, sensing Britain's intention, the Chinese accused 
it of deviating from the Joint Declaration and demanded all 
arrangements during the transition period must converge with the 
Basic Law, a mini constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong which 
would be promulgated by the Chinese National People's Congress 
in 1990. Former British foreign minister, Timothy Renton, 
visited Beijing in January 1986 and said the British Government 
agreed developments in Hong Kong should "converge" with the 
Basic Law. So Beijing had virtual veto power over important 
decisions during the transition. 
  Faced with growing demand for direct elections, the Hong 
Kong 
Government rigged an opinion poll in 1987 to say there should 
only be 10 directly-elected Legislative Council seats in 1991 
since the people's views on direct elections in 1988 were 
divided. This was roundly condemned, among others by members of 
the UN Human Rights Committee, which held hearings on Hong Kong 
in November 1988. Shaken by the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, the 
British did some damage control by offering to increase the 
number of directly- elected seats in 1991 to 18. 
  When Chris Patten was appointed Governor, he proposed 
cautious constitutional reforms in October 1992, seeking to 
widen the franchise within the Basic Law. I called it "a drop 
of democracy". Even then, it was brutally attacked by the 
Chinese Government. Such an antagonistic attitude showed 
Beijing would not even tolerate a limited degree of democracy, 
let alone give the SAR a high degree of autonomy. 
  Apart from being less than democratic, the Government's 
package is complicated and contrived. The other amendments 
members have proposed are even more complex and have not been 
examined by the Council. It is farcical to think the Council 
might pass a bill which has not been scrutinised! 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd once said he did not want the 
final chapter of the history of the British Empire to end in a 
shabby way. If the Government insists on putting forward an 
undemocratic and incomprehensible system, Mr Hurd's fears could 
well come true.

  [Text] The Liberal Party is confident it will secure 
enough votes in the Legislative Council to thwart the Governor's 
political reform proposals. Their confidence stems from a visit 
to Beijing by a party member, James Tien, who says he received 
encouragement from China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. 
  Tien, who returned from Beijing yesterday, said Qian had 
indicated "support in principle" for the amendments proposed by 
the Liberal Party and some independent members, known as the 
1994 package. China's backing should deliver a crucial five 
votes in favour of the Liberals' amendments to Chris Patten's 
plan when the issue is decided an Wednesday. 
  Meanwhile, Patten has been stepping up his campaign for 
support. Yesterday he hosted a breakfast for 10 non-aligned 
legislators -- members of the so-called Breakfast Club. The 
meeting provided his last opportunity for lobbying the group. 
The Chief Secretary, Anson Chan, and the Secretary for 
Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, were also present. 
  The 10 legislators invited were Simon Ip, Eric Li, Martin 
Barrow, Vincent Cheng, Marvin Cheung, Timothy Ha, Roger Luk, 
Samuel Wong, Hui Yin-fat, and Andrew Wong. Apart from Hui, who 
has pledged support for the Patten proposals, and Wong who has 
said he would oppose all amendments except his own, the other 
eight legislators are thought to support the 1994 package. 
  An independent legislator, Emily Lau, is also rallying 
support for her private member's bill for full direct elections 
but is likely to support Patten. It is understood that apart 
from the 13 United Democrats, Hui, Pang Chun hoi, Christine Loh, 
and Wu have also pledged support for Lau's bill. 
  Qian told Tien to "do your best in Hong Kong" when he was 
asked by Tien to persuade the pro-China legislators to vote for 
the amendments. The votes of five pro-Beijing legislators are 
crucial in deciding the fate of the Liberal package as there is 
now an almost equal split in the council between support for the 
amendments package and the Patten proposals. 
  The five are Tam Yiuchung, Philip Wong, David Li, Peggy Lam, 
and Tang Siutong.

<F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "HK Weekly Sued Over Hope Fund Allegations"] </F>
  [Text] A mainland education foundation is suing a Hong 
Kong weekly over false reports of missing funds. The China 
Youth Development Foundation (CYDF) yesterday filed a lawsuit in 
the Hong Kong Supreme Court against the Next Weekly Publishing 
Co. for its allegedly libelous charges. 
  "We are confident that we will win the case because our 
foundation has a clean record," said CYDF Secretary-General Xu 
Yongguang. 
  The lawsuit is crucial to the future of the Hope Project in 
China, the huge charity programme inaugurated five years ago to 
raise funds for improving the country's primary education, 
especially in underdeveloped areas. The foundation sent a 
written protest on June 16 to the magazine, after it had 
reported that the foundation had misused the donations. The 
report has caused some overseas Chinese to hesitate in donating 
money for the project, according to the CYDF. The foundation 
asked that the magazine indemnify it for losses due to the 
alleged libel and publish an apology. 
  The foundation demanded the magazine reply within one week 
and warned that it would take legal actions otherwise. The 
magazine has not responded, according to the foundation. 
  On January 21, 1994, the weekly magazine carried a story, 
saying "donations for the Hope Project had gone missing." 
  The article said that the funds had been intended for 
repairing a dilapidated primary school in Xianghai Township of 
Jilin Province. According to the CYDF, the school got the 
donations of 180,000 yuan ($21,000) on July 29, 1993 and the 
main building of the school had been put into use before the 
article appeared. 
  "The report which was inconsistent with facts and used 
insulting phrases has produced harmful effects both in China and 
among overseas Chinese," said Xi Jieying, CYDF spokesman. Many 
other facts in the report were also wrong, he added. He said 
donated funds, from home or abroad, are carefully recorded in 
the computer system of CYDF.

<F P=106> [Station reporter Hsiao Chin-wei's report; from the "Hookup" </F>
program] 
  [Text] In a bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade [GATT], government departments are making active 
efforts to amend relevant regulations to meet GATT standards. 
  With respect to intellectual property rights [IPR], the 
Ministry of the Interior will amend the Copyright Law so that it 
conforms to specific trade-related regulations in the IPR 
agreement. As far as our application for GATT membership is 
concerned, the international community always treats us as a 
developed country. 
  According to GATT regulations, the Copyright Law should be 
amended within one year after application has been submitted to 
join the world trade organization. In other words, the 
Copyright Law should be amended by 1 January 1996. The most 
important revisions will be the need for mandatory authorization 
before foreign works can be translated, and the lease rights of 
movies. 
  According to Wang Chuan-lu, chairman of the copyright 
committee, the mandatory need for translation rights 
authorization in the Copyright Law is based on educational 
needs. He added that certain writers who cannot find copyright 
owners can also translate and disseminate their works. While 
this is not in line with (?GATT) regulations, in reality there 
has been no application for authorization of translation rights 
since the Copyright Law went into effect two years ago. The 
experience in Japan has been that there have been very few 
applications for authorization of translation rights. This 
being the case, the effects of the amendment will be limited. 
  As for the lease right, it currently applies only to 
computer 
software and audio tapes. The amendment will cover all 
audio-video products. And movies may not be leased until [word 
indistinct] authorization from the primary copyright owners. In 
other words, movies cannot be leased until fees have been paid 
twice. Consequently the cost of leasing movies will increase by 
a great margin. 
  Besides this, the amendment's greatest impact will be seen 
in 
the substantial broadening of the area which the Copyright Law 
will protect. In addition to copyright owners in Britain, the 
United States, and Hong Kong, the copyright of owners in all 114 
GATT members must be protected. Foreign works will have to used 
even more cautiously. 
  This is Hsiao Ching-wei reporting from the Ministry of the 
Interior.

  [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The Council of Agriculture 
(COA) on Saturday [25 June] passed a revised draft to allocate 
NT$10 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (U.S.$370 million) for a fund 
to subsidize local farmers who will be affected by Taiwan's 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. 
The COA had originally allocated only NT44 billion (U.S.$148 
million) for the fund. 
  All farmers will be eligible for the subsidies. The original 
draft had stipulated that only farmers who produce certain items 
-- citrus fruit, apples, plums, peaches, tea, beef, duck, pork, 
and shrimp -- would be elibgible for the subsidiy. A COA 
offical said that if the prices of agricultural products fall 
due to an influx of foreign products after Taiwan joins GATT, 
the COA will evaluate whether Taiwan farmers are being adversely 
affected, and subsidize them accordingly if they are.

  [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first-ever foreign 
exchange [Forex] brokerage is expected to open in early July as 
part of the government's efforts to build Taipei into a regional 
funding center, the Central Bank of China (CBC) said Tuesday. 
  CBC officials said the "Taipei Forex Inc." will begin 
providing broking services in foreign exchange trading and 
foreign currency financing after obtaining a business license 
from the Ministry of Finance. 
  Preparations for the brokerage's operations have been 
completed, they said, adding that the Central Bank gave the 
green light to the company's establishment last September. 
  The brokerage, formed by 21 domestic banks, three foreign 
banks, and three international money brokers, was established in 
line with the "guidelines for approval of foreign exchange 
brokers" promulgated last August. 
  Domestic banks with a stake in the firm include the 
International Commercial Bank of China, the United World Chinese 
Commercial Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Chinatrust 
Commercial Bank, while the three foreign banks are the Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank, the Bank of Tokyo, and the American Express Bank. 
  The three international money brokerage houses are A&amp;P 
of 
Britain, the Amsterdam-based Harlow Butler, and the New 
York-based Yagi-Euro. 
  The foreign exchange brokerage is a new step in the 
government's financial liberalization strategy, which aims to 
develop Taipei into an Asia-Pacific funding center and 
eventually a regional financial hub, the officials pointed out. 
  The firm will have a paid-in capital of NT [New Taiwan] 
$199.50 million (US$7.36 million), they added. 
  The officials pledged that the Central Bank will take the 
initiative to forge stronger ties with financial institutions in 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries to 
help expand the Taipei foreign exchange market. 
  Daily transactions on the Taipei market ranged between 
US$100 
million and US$200 million, while those in Japan, the United 
States, and Germany amounted to tens of billions. 
  Meanwhile, domestic gold traders led by the state-run 
Central 
Trust of China (CTC) have decided to apply to the Ministry of 
Finance for approval on 24-hour gold trading. 
  Chang Cheng, director of the CTC Trade Department, said that 
if all goes well, 24-hour gold trading could begin sometime in 
the next six months. 
  Gold dealers could focus trading in Hong Kong and Singapore 
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., then transfer trading to European markets 
from 3 p.m. to 12 p.m., and finally deal in New York trading 
until 3 a.m. the next day, Chang said. 
  The 24-hour trading will provide both domestic and overseas 
gold investors with greater access to the global gold market, he 
stressed.

  [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The Taoyuan District Court 
in northern Taiwan on Friday [24 June] convicted and sentenced 
30 Taoyuan County councilors to up to two years in prison on 
charges of vote-buying and corruption and acquitted two others. 
  Hsu Chen-yun, the speaker of the Taoyuan County Council, 
received a two-year jail term and had his civil rights stripped 
for three years. According to the verdict, Hsu gave money and 
offered sightseeing trips to councilors in exchange for their 
votes in the March 1 county council election. 
  Hsu, a Kuomintang member, had pleaded not guilty to the 
charges. He will appeal. Twenty-nine other councilors who along 
with Hsu were found guilty by the court were given prison terms 
ranging from 10 months to 22 months and all had their civil 
rights suspended for two years. Each had pleaded not guilty. 
  Fourteen of the 29 councilors are KMT members, six are 
affiliated with the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's 
largest opposition party, and nine others are independents. 
  Twenty-nine people in Keelung city as well as Miaoli, 
Kaohsiung and Hualien counties, including a speaker and three 
deputy speakers, had previously been sentenced for either paying 
or accepting bribes. 
  Separately, prosecutors in 10 other cities and counties 
across Taiwan have charged over 350 on similar charges in 
Taiwan's worst election scandal. The Kuomintang won all 23 city 
and council speaker posts in the polls.

  [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy 
remained on the track of steady growth in May, flashing a safe 
"green light" on a government composite scaling system, the 
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported 
Monday [27 Jun]. May's overall economic performance received a 
score of 28 points on the CEPD-designed monitoring scale, up 2 
points from April and also the highest level so far this year, 
the council said. It was the sixth straight month the domestic 
economy has received a "green" rating. 
  The index of leading economic indicators, which gauges the 
country's economic prospects for the next three to five months, 
rose 0.9 percent from April to reach a five-year high of 114.8. 
However, the index of coincident economic indicators, which 
measures economic performance for the month, dropped 0.5 percnt 
from April to 138.2 mainly because of a slight decrease in 
manufacturing sales due to seasonal factors. 
  CEPD officials said the rise in the leading index indicates 
the economy will continue to grow steadily in the months ahead. 
Of the nine indicators the CEPD regularly monitors to measure 
the overall economic performance, five remained in the "green 
light" category in May. They were the industrial production 
index, the nonfarm-sector employment rate, manufacturing 
inventory, new orders received by manufacturers and bank loans. 
  Two indicators -- the stock index and the M1b money supply 
growth -- were upgraded from the "green" rating in April to the 
more bullish "yellow-red" rating, and the check-default rate 
also improved from the gloomy "blue" rating to the "yellow-blue" 
category. 
  Only one indicator -- the export growth rate -- was 
downgraded. It slipped from the "green" category to the 
"yellow-red" rating. 
  Hung Hui-yen, a section chief at the CEPD's Economic 
Research 
Department, said May's factory facility utilization rate reached 
78.8 percent, up 1.3 percent from the same month of 1993 and a 
two- year high. 
  The profit rate for local manufacturers also reached a 
22-month high of 6.1 percent in May, Hung reported. Moreover, 
manufacturing sales and new orders grew by 6.1 percent and 10.7 
percent, respectively, from the year-earlier levels. 
  "All these figures show the domestic economy will grow even 
faster in the second half of this year," Hung noted. 
  A recent CEPD survey of local manufacturers also reflected 
optimism about the country's future economic prospcts, Hung 
said. The survey found that 28 percent of manufacturers 
interviewed said they believe economic prospects will continue 
improving in the months ahead; 59 percent said the economy will 
remain almost the same, and only 13 percent said they are 
pessimistic about their business prospects.

  [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The domestic money supply 
grew at a faster-than-expected pace in May, causing concern 
among senior finance officials. The annual growth rates of the 
three major indices measuring the domestic money supply M1A, M1B 
and M2 reached 11.45 percent, 16.5 percent and 15.73 percent 
respectively in May, all higher than the April levels, according 
to statistics released by the Central Bank of China (CBC) 
Saturday [25 June]. 
  The M1A and M1B growth rates reached three-month highs, 
while 
the broadly-defined M2 growth rate was at its highest level 
since April 1993, when the rate hit 16.5 percent. May's M2 and 
M1B growth rates also exceeded the CBC-set 15 percent ceiling. 
  CBC Governor Liang Kuo-shu said the central bank has begun 
open-market operations to control the growth of domestic money 
supply. "We believe that through our open-market operations, the 
M2 annual growth rate will fall below the 15-percent ceiling in 
June," he said. 
  CBC Deputy Governor Chiu Cheng-hsiung attributed the high 
money supply growth rate for May in part to increased bank loans 
to manufacturers during the month. As local banks still have 
huge excess reserves, Chiu said, the central bank will intensify 
open-market operations to retrieve idle funds from the banking 
system to staunch money-supply growth. "We'll continue 
monitoring the domestic financial situation closely and will 
take necessary steps to keep the M2, M1A, and M1B growth rates 
within 10 to 15 percent," he added. 
  M2 is the broadest measure of a country's total money stock, 
comprising currency in circulation, checking and demand deposits 
as well as quasi-money (including time deposits and Treasury 
bills). The narrowly-defined M1A comprises cash in circulation 
and deposits in demand and checking accounts, while M1B 
comprises M1A plus passbook savings deposits.

  [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- Taiwan's U.S.$2.27 billion 
in exports to Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] 
members in the first quarter of the year more than doubled 
Mainland China's exports to those countries, the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Monday [27 
June]. 
  Taiwan also imported about 1.5 times more imports from ASEAN 
as a whole than did Mainland China, purchasing U.S.$1.82 billion 
worth of goods, the latest CEPD tallies show. ASEAN groups 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and 
Singapore. 
  During the first quarter, Taiwan recorded a trade surplus of 
U.S.$450 million with ASEAN, while Mainland China suffered a 
deficit of U.S.$60 million. Despite the fact that Taiwan had a 
larger amount of two-way trade with ASEAN, Mainland China's 
imports and exports to the region are growing at a faster pace, 
CEPD officials said. 
  Mainland China managed a 46 percent growth in exports to 
ASEAN over the first quarter of 1993 to U.S.$1.14 billion, while 
its imports jumped 35 percent to U.S.$1.2 billion, compared with 
Taiwan's 9.5 percent and 13.5 percent increases, respectively. 
  Singapore remained the major trading partner of both Taiwan 
and Mainland China in the January-March period. Mainland 
China's leading ASEAN trade partners after Singapore were 
Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, in that order, while 
Taiwan's were Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

  [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The Finance Ministry has 
decided to allow Taiwan banks easier access in doing business 
with mainland Chinese banks, a ministry official said Saturday 
[25 June]. Under the new measure, Taiwan banks' overseas 
branches will be allowed to do business directly with Mainland 
China's overseas branches, and will no longer have to go through 
foreign banks' overseas branches, the official said. 
  Overseas branches of Taiwan banks can also do business 
directly with foreign banks' mainland branches. 
  Previously, Taiwan banks wishing to do business with 
mainland 
banks had to first go through foreign banks' overseas branches 
and then through foreign banks' mainland branches. 
  The Finance Ministry is expected to submit the new measure 
during a meeting on July 4, the official said.

  [Text] Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police 
Administration, yesterday [25 June] said: The Chinese Communists 
executed four Taiwan nationals on charges of drug smuggling, but 
the Chinese Communists have not informed Taiwan's police of the 
arrests, investigations, trials, or executions of the four 
persons. The National Police Administration currently has no 
way of knowing how many, if any, Taiwan nationals are still 
being detained by the Chinese Communists for involvement in drug 
cases. Lu Yu-chun added: Because talks concerning criminals 
between the two sides have not yielded practical results, and 
because of the lack of established procedures, the two sides 
currently still follow precedents in repatriating criminals. 
Because no felony criminals from the mainland are currently in 
Taiwan or are being detained by Taiwan's police, the Chinese 
Communists are not likely to inform us of the number of Taiwan 
nationals currently detained by them. The Chinese Communists 
did not inform us before executing the four Taiwan nationals on 
drug smuggling charges, and we do not know if there are any 
Taiwan nationals currently being detained by them on drug 
smuggling charges. 
  Responding to a report by Chinese Communist official media 
about the execution of four Taiwan nationals yesterday in Xiamen 
for drug trafficking, Lin Kui-mei, head of the legal service 
department of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF], said: There 
has been more than one case in which Taiwan residents were 
executed on the mainland for committing crimes but we have never 
been officially informed. We learned of those cases through 
media reports or after people asked us for assistance. The 
Chinese Communists have judicial rights to punish Taiwan 
residents committing offenses on the mainland. The SEF has been 
told that some Taiwan residents were executed on the mainland 
for drug trafficking or for counterfeiting renminbi. An 
official of the Mainland Affairs Committee said the Chinese 
Communists should inform us through the SEF of any Taiwan 
residents executed on the mainland, for courtesy and respect 
purposes. He said this matter can be discussed at future 
general affairs consultations between the two sides.

  [Text] Taipei, June 24 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs on Friday [24 June] said that the government has no

  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Rock Leng made the statement in 
response to press queries on the possibility of a breakthrough

no formal contacts since India recognized Beijing in 1949. 
  Commenting on remarks by visiting former Indian Ambassador 
to 
Beijing A.P. Venkateswara that India will establish an office in 
Taipei by the end of August, Leng said that his ministry needs 
to verify that Venkateswara's remarks reflect the policy of the 
Indian Government. He said that the government hopes to develop 
relations with India, but that developing a relationship would 
take time. 
  Venkateswara, a member of an Indian delegation that arrived 
here last Friday, met with Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen 
on earlier this week, Other members of the Indian delegation 
include former Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral and the former

  [Text] Taipei, June 24 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Economic 
Affairs on Friday [24 June] urged Taiwan business people to cut 
imports of Japanese consumer goods to help trim Taiwan's huge 
trade deficit with that country. Taiwan's trade deficit with 
Japan hit a record U.S.$14.42 billion in 1993, and the deficit 
is expected to top U.S.$15 billion this year. 
  A ministry official urged Taiwan importers to diversify 
their 
sources of imports and to help promote domestic-made goods they 
would normally buy from Japan. Ministry statistics show that 
increasing salaries here combined with fewer import restrictions 
and the popularity of Japanese goods have worked to boost 
Japanese imports year after year. Last year, 34 types of 
Japanese goods were imported to the tune of U.S.$10 million each 
-- mostly electrical appliances, food additives, hygiene and 
beauty products, film, and video games. 
  The ministry official said a field study of Japanese imports 
found that products that are no longer popular in Japan may 
still sell in Taiwan for more than two or three times the cost 
of similar Taiwan products. He said some domestic importers 
even import Japanese foodstuffs whose "use-by" dates have 
expired, banking on their popularity here to turn a brisk profit.

  [Text] Lanzhou, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Gansu Province, one of 
the underdeveloped inland provinces in northwest China, has in 
recent years made considerable progress in introducing foreign 
funds. 
  An official of Gansu Foreign Funds Management Commission 
said 
that the province has introduced 1.25 billion U.S. dollars from 
international organizations and foreign countries and regions in 
the world, including the World Bank, World Food Program, the 
United Nations Development Program, Asian Development Bank, 
Canada, the United States, Japan and Germany, as well as Hong 
Kong and Japan. 
  Gansu has rich resources in its vast area. Due to natural 
conditions, until the mid-1980s about 75 percent of its people 
were living in poverty-stricken areas. 
  In the 1980s, Gansu introduced foreign funds into its 
agricultural development projects to improve the harnessing of 
water resources and irrigation. 
  The World Bank, Asian Development Bank and Japanese and 
German Governments also offered loans to Gansu for the 
development of its rural industry and technological 
transformation of state enterprises. 
  With the deepening of the reforms and expansion of 
opening-up, the province began to introduce foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  Before 1992, the province had only 39 foreign-funded 
enterprises, with total investment of about 30 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  In 1992 and 1993, the province approved 823 foreign-funded 
enterprises, with total investment of 480 million U.S. dollars. 
  The province also used 580 million U.S. dollars worth of 
foreign loans. 
  Last year, more than 320 foreign-funded enterprises went 
into 
operation, and their export value reached more than 30 million 
U.S. dollars.

"Ningxia Succeeds in Harnessing Huang He, Realizes Grain 
Self-Sufficiency"] 
  [Text] Yinchuan, 15 Jun (WEN WEI PO)--When being 
interviewed by WEN WEI PO, Huang Huang, member of the CPC 
Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Committee of Ningxia 
Autonomous Region, said: The interior region has been pursuing 
the strategy of "Ningxia -- coastal areas--overseas areas" in 
the process of expanding its opening and economic development 
since the beginning of this year. The autonomous region, which 
is neither a coastal area nor a border area, is actively 
improving its investment environment, and has established 
economic and trade relations with more than 60 countries and 
regions. Two years ago, there were no foreign-funded 
enterprises in Ningxia; at present, however, there are more than 
310, and they have brought over $1 billion of external 
investment to Ningxia from 23 countries and regions. Huang 
Huang, who was transferred from Jiangxi to the top post of 
Ningxia, said that during his tenure of office in Ningxia, his 
objective is to enhance the Ningxia people's living standards 
and bring the whole region to the level of being comparatively 
well-off by the year 2000. 
  Ningxia is located in the central valley of the Huang He in 
Northwest China. Secretary Huang Huang said: The river flows 
397 kilometers inside Ningxia, and the area of the river valley 
accounts for over 90 percent of the whole region's area. Since 
the beginning of reform and opening, cadres and masses in 
Ningxia have made great efforts to utilize the Huang He. The 
river has been basically harnessed, and the natural environment 
of the river valley has been improved. The irrigated area has 
been enlarged, and the economies of the mountainous areas 
developed. The state and the autonomous region invested 500 
million yuan in water pumping projects from Guyuan to Haiyuan 
and from Yanchi to Huanxian and Dingbian. The water of the 
Huang He is now being channeled up to the mountainous areas, and 
the two projects increased the irrigated area by nearly 800,000 
mu. In addition, a hydropower project is being launched in 
Daliushu; after completion, its power generation capacity will 
reach 7.8 billion kilowatt-hours. The reservoir will also 
irrigate 20 million mu of farmland in Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, 
Shaanxi, and Gansu. 
  Huang Huang said: The situation of agricultural production 
in Ningxia this year is very good, and the whole region will be 
self-sufficient in food grain. Although the mountainous area in 
the southern part of the region faces serious drought, the total 
grain output of Ningxia may still reach or even exceed last 
year's level. He said that the whole region is making efforts to 
fight the drought. Bai Lichen, chairman of the regional 
government, is guiding the work of fighting drought and sowing 
autumn crops in the southern area of the region. 
  Secretary Huang Huang also told reporters that the eight 
counties in the southern part of Ningxia are inhabited by people 
of the Hui nationality. That area is called the poorest of the 
poor areas in China. In the early 1980's, some 70 percent of 
the peasant households there could not get enough food and 
clothing. In the last 10 years, with the state's support, 
Ningxia allocated 30 million yuan every year to help the poor 
area, and allocated over 70 million yuan to develop 
manufacturing industries there in order to increase the local 
people's wealth. Financial resources were concentrated to 
improve production conditions and the ecological environment and 
to build terraced fields at an average of two or three mu per 
person and raise the per mu grain output to 500 jin. Thus, the 
peasants will have sufficient food. 
  At the same time, through resettlement arrangements, 150,000 
people have been moved from the poor mountainous areas to the 
plain areas, and they became rich two or three years after being 
resettled. So far, 85 percent of the peasants in southern 
Ningxia have sufficient food and clothing; and 10 percent of 
them have become comparatively well-off. 
  When talking about the investment environment, Secretary 
Huang Huang said: Ningxia has started a number of major 
transportation projects. The 280-km electrified railway line 
between Baoji and Zhongwei was completed and put to operation on 
9 June. A new airport 19 kilometers east of Yinchuan is under 
construction. Adding to the two old airports around Yinchuan, 
the capital city of the autonomous region will have air links to 
all major cities of the country and also to the Middle East, 
Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. In the field of 
telecommunications, 18 cities and counties of Ningxia have 
realized telephone dialing automation. This year, Yinchuan 
added 70,000 program-controlled telephone lines to its 
communications network, and direct diald to all major cities in 
the world is available. 
  Secretary Huang Huang also said that harmonious relations 
were being maintained among all religious groups in Ningxia.

  [Text] At a provincial meeting on party schools and 
education for party members held yesterday, provincial party 
Secretary Yin Kesheng pointed out: CPC committees at all levels 
must attach importance to the overall ideological work, and 
truly strengthen their leadership over party schools. They must 
actively explore new ways for education of party members to 
further give play to the role of fighting bastions of party 
organizations at all levels, and the vanguard role of the broad 
masses of party members. 
  Yin Kesheng added: At present, our reforms have entered a 
stage of taking strong fortifications characterized by the 
integration of overall advance with major breakthroughs. New 
situations and tasks have set new and more demands on the level 
of our theories, policies, knowledge, and work. Using Marxism, 
and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics in particular, to arm all party members 
and cadres is now more urgent than at any time in the past. 
  Yin Kesheng continued: In recent years, party schools and 
organization departments of CPC committees at all levels in our 
province and relevant departments have conscientiously 
implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress. They 
have made marked achievements in using the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm all party members. 
The fighting bastions role of party organizations at all 
levels, and the vanguard role of the broad masses of party 
members have been further brought into play. In the meantime, 
however, we must soberly realize that under the new situation, 
some new problems have occurred. The broad masses of our party 
members and cadres are facing a new and severe test. The more 
we do to promote reform and opening up and develop the economy, 
the more we must do to consciously strengthen party building, 
stick to the correct political orientation, and increase our 
sense of responsibility and urgency to arm the entire party with 
the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Yin Kesheng stressed: Party schools are schools for 
educating and training party members and cadres under the 
leadership of the CPC committees. The work for party schools 
must conform with the demands of the new situations and tasks. 
The key in this regard lies in deepening reform. At present 
and for a period to come, while carrying out reform in party 
schools, we must devote our efforts to enhance the 
applicability, aims, and efficiency of the teaching content. 
Solving difficult and key problems arising in reform, opening 
up, economic construction and teaching should be treated as a 
focal point in the scientific research work of party schools. 
We must make efforts to establish a teachers' contingent noted 
for its fine quality, strong party character, correct study 
style, and worthiness of the name of teachers. 
  While talking about the issue of education for party 
members, 
Yin Kesheng pointed out: With regard to education for party 
members, we must persist in combining theory with practice, and 
strengthen the applicability of the education. We must persist 
in mainly educating by positive measures, and giving full play 
to the exemplary role of outstanding party members. We must 
persist in differentiating one kinds of student from another, 
and providing education at different levels. We must persist in 
organically combining education for party members with control 
and supervision over them. In the meantime, we must persist in 
laying our stress on constructive work, and treating the work of 
benefiting party members as a foundation of our education to 
establish and improve the system and mechanisms for party 
members' education to push our province's education for party 
members to a new level. 
  Yin Kesheng called on CPC committees, party work organs, and 
leading cadres at all levels to approach the issue of party 
schools and education for party members from the high plane of 
the strategy for building socialist modernization and a lengthy 
and peaceful era in our country to truly put these issues on 
their important work agenda. They must clearly understand the 
situation and their tasks, and work in a down-to-earth manner to 
create a new situation in the development of party schools and 
education for party members in our province.

  [Text] Xian, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Song Jian, state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, inspected some nature reserves in 
northwest China's Shaanxi Province from June 22 to 24. 
  He visited the Foping Nature Reserve of wild plants in 
Hanzhong Prefecture, the panda living area at Changqing Forest 
Bureau and the Shaanxi Provincial Observation Station for 
crested ibis. 
  After listening to reports about work in the nature 
reserves, 
State Councillor Song said that while concentrating their 
efforts on protecting the wild animals and plants, nature 
reserves should try to make full use of their ecological 
environment to develop the local economy so as to raise funds to 
enable the protection work to continue. 
  He said that in some areas with the right conditions, a 
certain scale of animal husbandry and tourism is allowed and to 
breed endangered wildlife is encouraged. 
  State Councillor Song noted that satisfactory achievements 
have been made in protecting the crested ibis and the panda, 
which were both on the edge of extinction, adding that this 
showed that as long as everybody paid attention to protection of 
wild animals and plants, big progress would be made in the 
building of a good ecological environment.

  [Text] Of the 15 pairs of ports linking up Heilongjiang 
Province with the Russian Federation, 13 have been accessible by 
vehicles. Their annual import and export volume reaches 830,000 
tonnes, up 117 times from the figure of 1988 when the vehicle 
transportation between the two sides opened. The port vehicle 
transportation has become a key transportation force with which 
the province delivers its goods to foreign countries. 
  In 1988 when the province started to open its vehicle 
transportation to the Russian Federation, only 7,000 tonnes of 
goods were transported. Along with the ceaseless expansion of 
the border trade between the two countries, the transportation 
volume has increased by a big margin. Over the past six years, 
more than 1.8 million tonnes of goods were transported through 
these ports by vehicles. Of this, more than 1.33 million tonnes 
of goods were transported through Heihe and Suifenhe ports. So, 
these two ports become the province's two largest ports with 
vehicle transportation with the Russian Federation. There are 
international regular passenger bus services linking up Heihe 
and Dongning ports with the Russian ports opposite to them. 
Some of the ports have also temporarily opened passenger bus 
services. So far, 23 international vehicle transportation 
enterprises with more than 850 vehicles have been established in 
the province through examinations and approvals. When examining 
and approving the foreign transportation enterprises and the 
vehicles used for foreign transportation, the provincial 
communications department has broken down the barriers between 
different trades and made efforts to develop big container 
vehicles, refrigeration vans, tank trucks, and [words 
indistinct] goods transportation vehicles so as to gradually 
rationalize the vehicle transportation structure. 
  The infrastructural facilities of the province's border 
county towns and border ports are extremely weak. With the 
strain on construction funds, over the past years, the 
provincial communications department has built the 
infrastructural facilities in these towns and ports in a 
well-planned manner and in the order of priorities. The 
Ministry of Communications, the province, and the localities 
jointly invested more than 10 million yuan to build goods 
transportation storehouses in Heihe, Suifenhe, and Tongjiang. 
So, these three ports have basically obtained 30,000-tonne 
storage capacity and semi-mechanized loading and unloading 
capability. The port transportation conditions have ceaselessly 
improved. 
  Dongning-Sanchakou, Luobei-Mingshan, and Mishan-Shangzhi 
highways and [words indistinct] project have been made available 
to the users.

  [Text] Shenyang, June 25 (XINHUA) -- The water of a major 
reservoir in northeast China's Liaoning Province is becoming 
cleaner thanks to the local government's continuous efforts for 
water resources protection over the past few years. 
  According to a water resources management official, the 
latest survey shows that the reservoir meets the national 
standards for drinking water and its transparency is increasing. 
  The Dahuofang Reservoir, covering an area of 5,437 sq km and 
with a water storage capacity of 2.187 billion cu m, is one of 
the country's biggest and provides drinking water for millions 
of urban dwellers in Fushun and Shenyang cities, as well as 
water for industrial use. 
  To protect the water resources in the reservoir, the 
provincial government formulated a special regulation as early 
as in 1990 to shut down all industrial enterprises that could 
cause pollution in the area of the reservoir. 
  Other steps taken to keep the water from pollution were a 
ban 
on swimming and sports in and around the reservoir and the 
removal of several poultry and pig farms.

  [Text] Five workers were killed and another two seriously 
injured by an explosion at a joint venture in eastern Beijing's 
Tongxian County last Tuesday morning. 
  The blast wrecked the Hong Kong-invested Huaxin Chemical 
Company Ltd factory at 7:45 am while the seven people were 
mixing a solvent adhesive in the workshop, according to Yang 
Wanlu, an official from Beijing's Municipal Labour Bureau. 
  "One of the reasons for the accident was the joint venture's 
poor management and improper operation," said Yang. 
  Since June last year, a number of major industrial accidents 
with fatalities have hit the headlines, particularly from the 
southern coastal areas. Many of the disasters have been 
attributed to slack management and lax safety procedures.

  [Excerpts] At 0456 on 23 June, a serious explosion took 
place at an (?aluminum material) plant, located in the 
municipality's Hebei District. The plant's workshop collapsed 
and some people were killed or injured. This explosion also 
brought about damages to some residential houses and [words 
indistinct] units. This explosion killed 10 people and injured 
five. It shook some residential houses near the plant and 
damaged them in various degrees. 
  The municipal party committee and the municipal government 
have paid full attention to this explosion. Zhang Lichang, 
deputy secretary of the municipal party committee and mayor of 
the municipality; Li Huifen and Song Pingshun, standing 
committee members of the provincial party committee and vice 
mayors; Wang Dehui, vice mayor; and Zhang Guanwen [title as 
received], secretary general of the municipal government, 
successively went to the scene to direct the emergency and 
disaster-relief work, made rescue arrangements on the spot, and 
adopted a series of measures for rapidly making living 
arrangements for the masses living close to the plant. Song 
Pingshun and Zhang Guanwen called on the injured at the hospital. 
  Security personnel, fire fighters, traffic policemen, and 
armed policemen arrived at the scene just a few minutes after 
the accident occurred. They first put out the big fire caused by 
the explosion, rushed to rescue the injured persons, and 
directed traffic. Thus, the work of keeping public order was 
immediately carried out. 
  According to municipal leaders, a department in charge of 
rushing to deal with the emergency with (Shi Xiaopeng), 
secretary of the Hebei District party committee; and (Zhang 
Huacun), head of the district, as general directors was 
established. Over 100 cadres in Hebei District engaged 
themselves in this work. [passage omitted] 
  On the evening of 23 June as soon as Gao Dezhan, secretary 
of 
the municipal party committee, returned to his residence, he 
personally called the emergency department, asking about the 
progress of the emergency work and the arrangements for the 
livelihood of the masses, hearing the report by the responsible 
comrades of Hebei District, and also setting specific 
requirements for making living arrangements for the masses on 
the same night and for well dealing with the aftermath of the 
explosion. 
  With the concerted efforts by various departments and the 
arduous struggle by the commanders and fighters of the public 
security and armed police forces, the cleanup of the scene was 
basically completed before 2000 on the same day. 
Simultaneously, the supply of coal gas, water, and electricity 
for nearly 1,000 households was completely restored; the masses' 
livelihood was properly arranged; and the social order was good. 
The broad masses of the people highly praised the work done by 
various departments of the municipality and the district. 
[passage omitted] 
  The cause of the accident is under further investigation.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 4 June, the standing 
committee's study center group of the Tianjin Municipal Party 
Committee, chaired by Gao Dezhan, municipal party committee 
secretary, conscientiously studied and discussed Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's important speech made in the concluding meeting of the 
fourth study and discussion session of principal leading cadres 
at provincial and ministerial levels. Gao Dezhan emphasized: 
We should conscientiously carry out the important spirit of 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech, take studying Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as a long-term basic task, make efforts to 
master the scientific system of Comrade Xiaoping's theory, keep 
closely in view the overall work situation of the whole party 
and contemporary China's overall developing situation, pay 
attention to studying and resolving the practical and important 
problems in Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization 
drive, and promote the study of the Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and Tianjin Municipal 
Party's ideological and theoretical level to a new height. 
  At the study and discussion meeting, focusing on Comrade 
Jiang Zemin's important speech, everybody discussed about their 
study experiences and understanding on how to further deepening 
the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Everybody held that the 
speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin expounded profoundly the boundless 
significance of studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory by the 
whole party, especially by the party's leading cadres, under the 
new situation, analyzed the study situation comprehensively by 
seeking truth from facts, and set forth new and higher demands 
on deepening the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. To 
conscientiously study and carry out the speech's spirit is very 
important for us when we further put into effect the strategic 
task of arming the party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, conscientiously 
strengthen the building of the party, and ensure the smooth 
operation of reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 
  Everybody held: Since last year, especially after the 
publication of the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, Tianjin's party committees at all levels, in line 
with the plan of the central authority and municipal party 
committee, have conscientiously organized the broad party cadres 
to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and unfolded a study 
upsurge. Tianjin has successively held 12 district, county, and 
bureau leading cadres' theoretical study and discussion sessions 
and training classes, and 598 leading cadres attended. With a 
good start, leading cadres' theoretical study attained the real 
results of arming the mind, unifying thoughts, and carrying 
forward tasks. The current Tianjin broad party cadres' 
theoretical study has shifted from a thorough reading of the 
original work to conducting the study on special topics, and the 
study situation is good. But we should perceive that Tianjin's 
study is still preliminary. The current municipal situation is 
very good; and the task to deepen reform, open up wider, promote 
development, and remain stable is strenuous. Shouldering the 
heavy burden, leading cadres need to further deepen theoretical 
study and make more efforts to guide practice by applying 
theory. We should build a strong atmosphere in the entire party 
of Tianjin for the theoretical study and for resolving practical 
problems by investigation and study and thereby promote to a new 
height both the study of comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and the 
ideological and theoretical levels of the entire party. 
  At the study and discussion meeting, Gao Dezhan talked about 
his study experiences in attending the fourth theoretical study 
session held by the central authority for provincial- and 
ministerial-level principal leading cadres and expressed his 
significant opinions on how to conscientiously carry forward the 
crucial spirit of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech and persistently 
deepen Tianjin's theoretical study. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: To deepen study, we should resolve 
problems in two aspects. First, we should further upgrade 
understanding and strengthen the awareness in studying Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory. We should fully understand both the 
party's situation in the new period and the party's historical 
task on shoulder and thereby request cadres at all levels, 
especially the leading cadres, to attach more importance to 
theoretical study than ever before and to upgrade theoretical 
accomplishment. Leading cadres' theoretical levels influence 
the awareness of carrying out the party's basic line and also 
influence the level and ability of leadership. Only by being 
clear-headed and firm in theory can we remain clear-headed and 
firm in politics; and only by comprehensively, with awareness in 
mind, carrying forward the party's basic line can we achieve the 
success of socialist modernization. To arm the minds of the 
broad party cadres with comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is a 
long-term basic task; and leading cadres at all levels should 
keep the overall situation in view and, with a high sense of 
historical responsibility and mission, persistently pay 
attention to and achieve success in the study and conduct it to 
a profound level step by step. Second, we should master the 
scientific system of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, keep 
closely in view the actual conditions and the general task of 
the whole party, and study and eliminate the important problems 
in reality. Having a rich and profound content, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a scientific theoretical system. When we 
deepen the study of the theory, we should concentrate our 
efforts on mastering the scientific system. We should 
conscientiously and attentively study the original work and 
firmly grasp the theme of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; focusing on the party's basic line, which is 
the principal line, profoundly understand the quintessence of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from fact; and master 
the generality and inner link of the scientific system of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory. To keep reality in view is to 
study theory based on reality; and the purpose of studying 
theory is to resolve practical problems and concentrate our 
efforts on using what we have studied. 
  Using Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory as a guideline, we should conscientiously 
measure our thoughts, sum up tasks, upgrade understanding, 
master the overall situation, persist in the correct, overcome 
the erroneous, and check what is lopsided. We should go deep 
into the realities, investigate and study, and make efforts 
seeking the proper measure to counter the new situation and new 
problems in reform and construction, especially in developing a 
socialist market economic system. At present, we should 
correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability by keeping the overall work situation of the whole 
party in mind and taking Comrade Xiaoping's theory as guideline, 
educate and lead cadres and the masses in and outside the party 
to safeguard the general task with more initiative, promote the 
realization of the general task, and maintain and develop the 
good trend of Tianjin's various work. 
  Gao Dezhan also made concrete requirements on ding a good 
job 
in theoretical study. First, we should concentrate efforts on 
understanding and analyzing the theoretical study situation in 
Tianjin, do research on some problems, conscientiously sum up 
the proceeding stage of study experiences, strengthen the 
guidance to Tianjin's theoretical study in a timely manner, and 
deepen the study persistently. Second, leading cadres at the 
municipal level should set good example on deepening study and 
take the lead in learning to master the scientific system of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and in analyzing and resolving 
the new things and problems occurred in practice by applying 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theoretical analysis. Third, the study 
of the study center group of the municipal party's standing 
committee should be further improved and upgraded. We should 
closely integrate the practice of Tianjin's reform, opening up, 
and modernization drive; focus on the study on special topics; 
have the practical problems in mind while studying theory; and 
resolve practical problems by the guidance of theory. According 
to their own division of tasks, leaders at the municipal level 
should, in grasping the division of tasks with individual 
responsibility, be aware of taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory as guidance, truly integrate the study and the practice, 
and make efforts to upgrade work level. By studying, we should 
not only upgrade the theoretical level but also promote the 
ability to do research and resolve problems. We should 
integrate theoretical study with investigation and study and 
with the effort to resolve practical problems; have practical 
problems in mind while studying theory; and resolve practical 
problems by the guidance of theory. Fourth, By using Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory to guide practical tasks, we should give 
prominence to key points. Judging from Tianjin's situation, 
currently we should work hard for new progress and breakthrough 
in the four aspects of paying particular attention to deepening 
reform, opening up wider, invigorating the spiritual 
civilization, and strengthening the party building, with the 
focus on the general task of the entire party.

  [By reporters Debin (1795 2430) and Wang Rantong (3769 3544 
1749): "Inner Mongolia Central Economic Zone Should Become an 
Important Piece in the National Layout of Productive Forces"] 
  [Text] Superior developmental conditions and an important 
strategic position determine that the Inner Mongolia central 
economic zone should become an important factor in the national 
layout of productive forces. This was a common understanding 
reached at the "symposium of the development strategy for the 
Inner Mongolia central economic zone" held in Beijing on 13 June. 
  The symposium was cosponsored by the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee and Government and the China 
Comprehensive Development Research Institute. Attending were 
Wang Qun, Wu Liji, Yun Bulong, Zhou Weide, and Tu Ke, regional 
leaders; and Ma Hong, Liu Yunshan, Chen Tonghai, Xu Penghang, Wu 
Jie, An Zhiwen, Pei Yingwu, Wang Wenze, Bi Qun, Fan Weitang, Lu 
Yanchang, Wang Min, Lin Ling, Liu Shulan, and Zhou Daozhi, 
leaders of relevant ministries, committees, and units of the 
state. 
  In his speech, Wang Qun expounded the important strategic 
significance in building the Inner Mongolia central economic 
zone. He said: Developing the Inner Mongolia central economic 
zone is a strategy to make the country prosper and the border 
area strong, which has taken shape after earnest investigation 
and study based on the state overall economic development plan 
and Inner Mongolia's reality. It is an issue not only for Inner 
Mongolia but also for the entire country; and it is not only an 
economic issue but also a political issue. In the overall 
strategy for the state's economic development, the Inner 
Mongolia central economic zone will become an important pillar. 
Building this economic zone conforms to the state's industrial 
policy and the requirements of the state's overall development 
strategy and is also conducive to the development and stability 
of the border minority nationality areas. Exploitation of the 
abundant resources of this zone is all the more conducive to the 
state's construction of the energy resources base in the 21st 
century and will also effectively promote the endeavors to 
strengthen the border area and consolidate national defense and 
to achieve the common prosperity of the various nationalities. 
  The Inner Mongolia central economic zone is a triangle area 
along Huang He, which borders on northern Shanxi and Shaanxi and 
takes Hohhot, the capital city of the autonomous region, Baotou, 
the steel city in the grassland, and Ih Ju League, the sea of 
coal, as its mainstay. It holds not only 80 percent of the 
world's rare earth, one-sixth of China's coal, abundant iron, 
nonferrous metal, and oil and gas, but it also holds one-third 
of Inner Mongolia's industrial fixed assets and a half of its 
scientific and technical forces. With a substantial industrial 
foundation, convenient transport systems, and favorable 
conditions for the alignment of industries, it has good 
exploitation prospects and a tremendous development potential. 
  Focusing on the "outlines of the development strategy for 
the 
Inner Mongolia central economic zone," the participating 
leaders, experts, and scholars conducted sincere study and 
exploration. They held: A locality should look for new ways of 
development if it is to narrow its gap from advanced localities. 
Domestic and foreign experiences proved that the most effective 
strategy to narrow the gap is giving preferential policies to 
key localities and key industries, investing the limited 
economic resources in a relatively concentrated manner in the 
localities with better conditions for comprehensive development 
and a relatively superior economic and social environment to 
facilitate their extraordinary development and to turn them into 
regional polar nucleus of increase or development center, and 
then, through their spreading and transmission role, promoting 
the economic growth and social progress of other localities. 
The Inner Mongolia central economic zone is one of the 
localities with the best conditions to become such a polar 
nucleus of increase. In addition, accelerating the development 
of the Inner Mongolia central economic zone will help the 
shaping of the polar nucleus of increase that effectively 
facilitates the continuous escalation of the industrial and 
technological structure of the entire Inner Mongolia and will 
lead to the economic development and social progress of Inner 
Mongolia. It also can be regarded as the best combination 
between the state's key industries and the superior localities 
suitable for developing these industries and the organic 
combination between the emphasis given to industries and that 
given to localities and between the preferential policies given 
to industries and those given to localities to develop the 
priorities of development. In the process of moving the 
strategic priorities of state development to the west, this zone 
will become the first base for making progress that links the 
east to the west. Besides, the Inner Mongolia central economic 
zone is an important hinterland of the economic zone around 
Bohai Sea and also an important area linking Northeast Asia with 
the Eurasian continental bridge. Accelerating the development 
and construction of the Inner Mongolia central economic zone 
conforms to the state's overall layout of economic development 
because it helps link the economy and the market of north, 
northeast, and northwest China and the Bohai rim and link 
China's economy with the economy of the world. 
  Some participants familiar with Inner Mongolia's conditions 
also pointed out optimistically: Despite the fact that the 
"outlines of the development strategy for the Inner Mongolia 
central economic zone" have yet to be appraised and improved, 
construction of the zone has begun long ago, and many state and 
regional key projects built in this zone have made eye-catching 
headway. Some comrades pointed out in their speeches: The 
world has developed to a new historical stage, and the new world 
pattern calls for speeding up the exploitation and construction 
of border minority nationality areas and for enabling their 
abundant natural resources to play a proper role in economically 
consolidating and strengthening the border areas. 
  The participants also earnestly discussed a series of issues 
in building the Inner Mongolia central economic zone and offered 
many valuable and constructive opinions. Wu Liji, chairman of 
the regional government, and Ma Hong, honorary director of the 
State Council Development Research Center and president of the 
China Comprehensive Development Research Institute, gave 
speeches to summarize the symposium.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--There 
have been 17 cholera cases in western Guangdong flood-stricken 
areas since these areas were hit by this year's third strong 
tropical storm. But this disease is under control because 
health departments have promptly taken measures. 
  As learned, after floods broke out in western Guangdong, 
drinking water and the aquatic environment in many parts of 
these areas were polluted; some flood victims drank unboiled 
water and ate unclean food, which led to the outbreak of cholera 
rarely seen in years in these localities. Intestinal infection 
and diarrhea began to increase. 
  On the day flooding occurred, the Guangdong Provincial 
Health 
Department sent medical and epidemic prevention personnel to 
western Guangdong to guide medical and epidemic prevention work 
there; it also transported a large amount of disinfectants to 
these localities to sterilize drinking water and the aquatic 
environment. As a result, the epidemic was stopped from 
spreading.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 24 (XINHUA) -- About 30,000 
passengers have been held up in this provincial capital of 
Guangdong because of serious flooding which hit six southern 
Chinese provinces from the middle of this month. 
  According to officials with the Guangzhou Railway 
Administration, by this morning, the station had cancelled 44 
passenger trains to other cities across the country since June 
15, when it first stopped operating the No. 142 passenger train 
to Chongqing city, Sichuan Province. 
  Some 100,000 passengers' trips in all were affected by the 
cancellations. 
  The officials said they had to cancel more passenger trains 
to Tianjin, Hangzhou and Kunming today and tomorrow. Almost all 
the passenger trains now starting from Guangzhou going 
southwards have arrived later than scheduled. 
  They predicted that train services at the station would not 
be fully back to normal for several days. 
  For the past week the station has been staffing three extra 
counters round the clock to deal with returned train tickets. 
  The number of passengers using the local civil air service 
also plunged sharply compared with normal times. Many groups 
who had planned to travel here for sightseeing or business 
returned their air tickets and cancelled their plans. 
  But officials with the Guangzhou Baiyun Airport of China 
South Airlines said that, in the past several days, the number 
of air passengers seemed to be climbing again, as more and more 
people switched to air travel from rail. 
  Water transport from Guangzhou to other areas was also 
forced 
to stop, until the water route from Guangzhou to Huizhou resumed 
the day before yesterday. 
  The flooding on the Beijiang and Xijiang rivers has driven 
the water level in the Pearl (Zhujiang) River up swiftly, 
causing some areas of Guangzhou to be flooded and affecting 
local transport.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province has taken the lead in China in setting up a 
land market network. 
  Over the past eight years the area of land leased in 
Guangdong has amounted to 31,000 ha, bringing the province a 
total income of 28 billion yuan. 
  The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress and provincial 
government have issued more than 30 regulations concerning land 
and real estate business. 
  In addition, a number of land evaluation services and 
consultancy services have been set up. 
  The Provincial Land Management Bureau last year set up a 
provincial land evaluation service center which has now trained 
more than 150 land evaluators. 
  Also last year Guangdong curbed the expansion of the land 
market. The province curbed the expansion of some development 
zones and real estate projects. 
  In the first five months of this year the total area for 
construction in Guangdong amounted to about 6,700 ha, a decrease 
of 43 percent compared to the same period of last year. 
  The land involved in real estate business totalled about 140 
ha, a decline of 60 percent compared to the same period of last 
year. 
  By the end of May some 21 cities and prefectures, and 75 
counties had begun to allocate land resources through the market. 
  Meanwhile, Guangdong has started to experiment in 
market-oriented land services in the allocation of non-farm land 
in rural areas, so as to expand the market mechanism from the 
state land sector to the collective land sector in the rural 
areas.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong, a south 
China coastal province, has expanded economic co-operation with 
other provinces while forging closer ties with the outside world. 
  In 1993 alone the province signed 3,209 economic 
co-operation 
contracts with other provinces. Those which have been carried 
out involve a total investment of 23.3 billion yuan and have 
produced 13.3 billion yuan in output value, a provincial 
official said. 
  According to the official, over 10,000 enterprises solely 
funded by other provinces or jointly invested in by Guangdong 
and other provinces have been licensed in Guangdong. Such 
ventures make up more than one third of the total in Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai and Huizhou, all of which are major industrial cities in 
the province. 
  So far, Guangdong has established a co-operation network 
with 
five provinces and three cities in central and south China. 
Zhaoqing and Zhuhai have developed close co-operation ties with 
three cities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  As a province which has a shortage of natural resources, 
Guangdong has also co-operated with three provinces in the 
southwest, which have rich power resources, to build power 
stations and railway lines. 
  The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone has already invested over 
five billion yuan in inland provinces to build 500 co-operative 
projects. A large number of township enterprises have also 
invested in inland provinces to start factories. Guangdong has 
invested 2.5 billion yuan in southwest China's Sichuan Province, 
the official said.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Xingbo: "Milestone For Foreign Firms Hit by SEZ"] </F>
  [Text] Shenzhen--The number of foreign-funded enterprises 
in South China's Shenzhen Economic Zone topped 10,000 by the end 
of May this year. 
  Latest statistics from the city's Industrial and Commercial 
Administration showed that the figure reached 10,015 by the end 
of the month. Of the total, Sino-foreign joint ventures 
numbered 5,761, co-operative firms 1,412 and solely 
foreign-funded enterprises 2,842. 
  Total investment in these enterprises amounted to $26.9 
billion; foreign investment reached more than $11.2 billion. 
The numbers come from Gong Peilian, director of the 
administration. 
  Gong said that from January to May this year, 
newly-registered foreign-funded enterprises numbered 710. Of 
these, 49 enterprises had investment exceeding $5 million. 
  The rapid development of foreign-funded enterprises in the 
special economic zone has accelerated the city's economic 
development. 
  In 1993, the total value of the city's industrial was more 
than 48 billion yuan ($5.7 billion) or 575 times that in 1979. 
Sixty per cent of industrial products from the zone are 
exported. 
  In the past 12 years, the scope of foreign investment has 
expanded. Besides investing in such fields as industry, real 
estate and public utilities, overseas businessmen are also 
pouring funds into commerce, service trades, food and 
warehousing. 
  This year's newly-registered enterprises are putting their 
money in real estate, highway construction and cultural 
facilities. 
  Local government officials attributed the rapid overseas 
investment to the city's good investment environment. 
  In the past 14 years, local government has attached great 
importance to Shenzhen's infrastructure construction. 
  The city is the only one in the country with marine, land 
and 
air trading ports. It has seven marine ports, four land ports 
and one airport. 
  In 1993, these ports saw 13,300 people, 18,900 vehicles and 
60 ships arriving and departing every day. 
  Transportation within the city is also very convenient. 
  Shenzhen Railway Station connects Hong Kong with the 
mainland; it has 180 train arrivals each day. 
  With nearly 100 trunk lines and some flyover crossings, the 
city has highways with a total length exceeding 1,000 kilometres. 
  There are eight harbours, 12 goods docks and 84 berths, with 
an annual handling capacity of 58.7 million tons. 
  The city also has good water and electricity supplies and 
convenient telecommunications facilities. 
  The local government has done a lot to safeguard the legal 
interests of foreign investors and to create a fair competitive 
environment. 
  For the convenience of overseas investors, the Industry and 
Commerce Administration has simplified the procedures for 
registering foreign-funded enterprises.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Pointing to their 
factory which will soon start operating, two Japanese investors 
said they were confident that they would reap an annual output 
worth 40 million yuan -- and pride as pioneer investors. 
  "We chose to invest in this place because of its advantages 
in regional location and its improving investment environment," 
said Miyajima Yuko, chairman of the board of the Doumen Meifu 
Textile Co. Ltd. in southern China's Zhuhai Special Economic 
Zone (Zhuhai SEZ) near Macao. 
  Yuko and Arai Koji, vice-chairman of the company, from the 
Mee Loong Trading Co. in Hong Kong, have spent 28 million yuan 
on 18,000-square-meter workshops. The company, in Wushan town 
of Doumen county, will produce woolen and cashmere products, 
camel hair and rabbit hair products to be exported to Japan, the 
United States, Britain and Canada. 
  The small county of Doumen, under the administration of the 
Zhuhai SEZ, has become an area popular with overseas investors. 
  In Wushan town alone, six projects based on overseas 
investments have been started this year, involving a total 
investment of 520 million yuan. 
  The town is about 2 km off the expressway linking Zhuhai 
airport and Zhuhai port, both under construction. 
  "It is not very convenient now, but that will change after 
the airport and sea port are put into operation the coming 
October," said Yuko, adding: "We are sure that our investment 
will have good economic returns." 
  Officials from the county government said that they have 
signed contracts involving 505 overseas-owned or cooperative 
projects. The overseas investment contractual volume topped 369 
million U.S. dollars and actual investment reached 153 million 
U.S. dollars. 
  The hometown of 152,000 overseas Chinese living around the 
world, the county accounts for more than 50 percent of the 
Zhuhai SEZ in terms of area and population. It has become one 
of the most important areas open to the outside world in 
Guangdong Province. 
  Infrastructure facilities have been improved to a large 
degree. 
  In the past, major means of transport were small boats and 
ferries, as the county is composed of 22 islands. The 
completion of the Zhuhai bridge and five other minor bridges 
made the county more accessible from the SEZ and helped bring an 
economic boom to the county. 
  Annual total output value in the past 14 years grew at an 
average of 25 percent, reaching 3.084 billion yuan last year. 
  Besides the Zhuhai airport and the Zhuhai sea port, the 
planned quasi-express railway from Guangzhou to Macao via Zhuhai 
will run across the county. 
  Several other projects, including an electric power plant 
and 
a water-works, are under construction.

  [Text] Guangzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Police from south 
China's Guangdong Province seized 1,408 kg of marijuana and 
arrested 15 alleged drug smugglers after a sea chase this week. 
  This drugs haul from a ship in the South China Sea was the 
largest since the founding of New China in 1949. 
  Seven alleged drug smugglers, with Thailand and Hong Kong 
passports, were arrested on board a ship of unidentified 
nationality. Also arrested were eight people from the mainland 
of China who were at the scene in boats, allegedly to receive 
the smuggled drugs. The drugs seized were in 51 boxes. 
  Details of the haul and the arrests were given here today by 
a spokesman of the Department of Public Security of the 
Guangdong Provincial Government.

hand over drugs to smugglers in boats from the mainland of China 
the following day. They pursued the ship and boats for more 
than one hour and captured all the drugs and the drug smugglers. 
  Investigations showed that the drugs came from a country in 
Southeast Asia. Further investigations are going on.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- China's major coal 
producer, Henan Province, plans to invest 1.84 billion yuan 
(about 220 million U.S. dollars) in the construction of a large 
gasification network. 
  The project, approved by the State Council, is scheduled to 
start late next year and be completed in three years. 
  The network will be centered in Yima city, a key coal 
production base in the province. It will consist of a 
gasification plant and a pipeline network. 
  Pithead coal gasification plants will be built at the Yima 
coal mines. 
  The first phase of the construction will be aimed at 
producing 1.2 million cu m of coal gas a day, 290,000 cu m of 
which will be used to make petrochemical products and the rest 
supplied to Luoyang and Zhengzhou cities for household use. 
  The second phase aims at a daily output of 2.4 million cu m 
of gas to ensure supplies to the other key cities of Kaifeng, 
Sanmenxia, Xuchang and Xinxiang. 
  Local officials predict that the construction of the network 
will also help improve pollution control and spur local economic 
development. 
  The province plans to use foreign funds and import advanced 
technologies and equipment from other countries for the project.

  [Excerpts] An anticorruption report meeting of the nine 
cities and prefectures of the whole province was held in 
Pingdingshan city on 16-19 June. Secretaries of the Discipline 
Inspection Commissions and Political Science and Law Commissions 
and responsible comrades in charge of public security work from 
the above-mentioned nine cities and prefectures attended the 
meeting. 
  Li Changchun, provincial party secretary; Song Zhaosu, 
provincial party deputy secretary; Song Guochen, member of the 
provincial CPC Committee Standing Committee and secretary of the 
provincial Discipline Inspection Commission; Li Xuebin, chief 
procurator of the provincial People's Procuratorate; and others 
attended and spoke at the meeting. [passage omitted] 
  At the meeting, various cities and prefectures briefed 
attendees on the three kinds of anticorruption work and existing 
problems. Li Xuebin, chief procurator of the provincial 
People's Procuratorate, made a report on the situation of 
investigating and handling big and important economic cases in 
the whole province. On the basis of summing up experiences, 
arrangements were made at the meeting for the anticorruption 
struggle in the future. 
  In his speech, Song Zhaosu said: At present, the 
anticorruption struggle in our province is progressing 
healthily. However, there is still a gap between what we have 
done and the demand of the masses and the CPC Central Committee. 
We must increase the number of cases handled, and focus our 
main efforts on investigating and handling cases like 
corruption, bribery, financial defrauding, smuggling, severe 
violations of financial and economic disciplines, and others. 
We must continue to direct the spearhead of the attack at 
judicial, law enforcement, and economic administration 
departments. Investigating and handling cases involving 
economic crimes of leading cadres at and above the county level 
must be treated as our top priority task to create a good 
environment for economic construction in our province. 
  Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun made an important 
speech. He said: In the new historical period, we must consider 
the anticorruption struggle from the high plane of the life and 
death of the ruling party. We must hold high the two banners of 
reform, enriching the people and opposing corruption, advocating 
cleanness and honesty. We must be firm and unshakable in taking 
economic construction as our center, so that our country will 
become strong and powerful and the masses rich as soon as 
possible. We must be firm and unshakable in strengthening the 
practice of cleanness and honesty and carrying out the 
anticorruption struggle. 
  Li stressed: It is necessary to make an overall plan to 
completely fulfill the following three anticorruption tasks. 1) 
We must concentrate our efforts on and give prominence to major 
cases. We must increase investigation and handling of big and 
important cases to boost the confidence of the masses in our 
anticorruption struggle. 2) We must do well the work of 
dealing with special cases to severely punish cadres those who 
violate the regulations to buy private cars, are in arrears with 
public funds thus harming our finances, and so on. 3) Cadres 
must be clean and honest and exercise self-discipline. In this 
connection, CPC Committees at all levels must conscientiously 
convene well democratic life meetings for the first half of the 
year and formulate and improve rules and regulations to further 
standardize leading cadres' behavior. 
  Li Changchun also urged making more efforts to educate 
cadres 
and strengthen leadership over anticorruption work, so that our 
anticorruption struggle can be carried out in a sustained and 
deep manner. He said: Making more efforts to educate cadres is 
a fundamental and important measures for forging closer 
party-masses and cadres-masses relations and preventing the 
occurrence of corrupt phenomenon. Education must be profoundly 
conducted among the broad masses of cadres to learn from the 
spirit of the people in Linxian County to work hard to do 
pioneering work, carry forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu by 
serving the people wholeheartedly, and make selfless devotion 
[words indistinct]. It is necessary to improve ideological and 
work styles of leading bodies at all levels. It is necessary to 
implement a responsibility system regarding party style and 
clean and honest government administration. Work at each level 
must be administered and supervised by its immediate higher 
authorities. Under the unified leadership of CPC Committees at 
all levels, the anticorruption struggle must be carried out in 
an organized and guided way. CPC Committees at all levels must 
put the anticorruption struggle in an important place on the 
work agenda. They must listen to the recent anticorruption work 
report and take new measure for promoting the struggle. The 
anticorruption struggle must be conducted closely around the 
central task of seizing the favorable opportunity, deepening 
reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and 
stabilizing the general situation. As far as specific links are 
concerned, the anticorruption struggle must be subjected to 
economic construction aimed at benefiting reform, opening up, 
and economic development. [passage indistinct] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The provincial party committee general office and 
people's government general office recently issued a circular 
urging all areas across the province to take forceful measures 
to crack down on crimes relating to cultural relics and 
energetically protect the province's cultural relics in light of 
actual local conditions. 
  The circular stated: This year has seen a growing number of 
crimes relating to cultural relics in various cities and 
counties across the province. The situation has even become 
very serious in a few areas where organized criminals dig up and 
steal valuables from a large number of ancient tombs in a 
planned way. 
  The circular urged the province's public security, 
procuratorial, and judicial organs as well as cultural, cultural 
relics protection, industrial, commercial, and customs 
departments to strengthen cooperation with one another in the 
on-going struggle against crimes relating to cultural relics and 
further improve the province's cultural relics protection work. 
The public security organs should, the circular stated, 
immediately organize competent personnel to investigate and 
crack cases of stealing or smuggling cultural relics; severely 
punish criminals involved in such cases; tighten control over 
the cultural relics market; and ban the black market on which 
cultural relics are sold against the law. 
  The circular emphatically noted: The party committees, 
people's governments, and departments and units concerned across 
the province should further understand the importance of 
cultural relics protection work and be fully aware of the 
harmfulness of crimes relating to cultural relics so as to place 
state cultural relics protection high on the agenda; earnestly 
organize people to severely and frequently crack down on crimes 
relating to cultural relics; resolutely put an end to and crack 
down on crimes relating to cultural relics; and strive to bring 
about a fundamental turn for the better in the province's 
cultural relics protection work.

  [Text] The province's state-owned budgetary industrial 
enterprises have gradually reduced losses this year. 
  The province's state-owned enterprises witnessed another 7 
percent drop in losses in May this year after seeing a 
significant drop in March and April. 
  In the first quarter of this year, some state-owned 
enterprises in the province either suspended operation or 
operated below capacity, resulting in a growing amount of 
losses. Given such a severe situation, party committees and 
government departments at all levels in the province immediately 
sent cadres to the grass-roots level and into enterprises to 
conduct investigations and study, with the result that they 
mapped out a series of countermeasures and turned challenges 
into opportunities. In accordance with the state policy of 
providing different state-owned enterprises with different 
amounts of circulation funds, the provincial departments 
concerned made a conscientious analysis of and divided the 
province's enterprises into several groups, providing 
enterprises capable of generating better economic results and 
producing readily marketable products with more circulation 
funds with an eye to helping them expand production and upgrade 
operation. Furthermore, the provincial departments concerned 
stopped supplying circulation funds to enterprises producing 
unsalable products; ordered enterprises incapable of turning 
losses into profits to suspend operation; and made proper 
arrangements for guaranteeing the basic livelihood of staff and 
workers of closed enterprises. 
  The aforementioned measures have succeeded in improving the 
province's product mix; raising the output of the province's 
large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, including Wuhan 
Iron and Steel Company, Zhongqi Company, and so on; and laying a 
sound basis for the province's normal industrial operation. 
  In the January-May period, the province's state-owned 
budgetary enterprises registered a 42.59 percent increase in 
profits and taxes in comparison with the same period last year, 
of which profits rose by 73.1 percent, with the result that 
their capital profit rate, sales profit rate, and 
production-marketing rate rose by 0.62 percent, 2.86 percent, 
and 93 percent respectively over the same period last year and 
were also higher than the country's average in the same period 
this year.

  [Text] A Central China Development Symposium was held in 
Wuhan from 18 to 19 June. 
  The symposium was attended by representatives from several 
Central China provinces; Chen Yaobang, State Planning Commission 
vice minister; and Wang Shengtie, provincial party committee 
standing committee member and provincial vice governor. 
  Chen Yaobang and Wang Shengtie delivered speeches at the 
symposium. 
  The symposium concluded: Central China possesses boundless 
economic development potential. 
  At the symposium, representatives from Hunan Province, Hubei 
Province, Henan Province, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province, and 
Wuhan City joined economic experts from the State Council 
Development Research Center, the Chang Jiang Water Conservancy 
Commission, the State Planning Commission, and other state 
departments concerned in exploring and discussing a new Central 
China development strategy. 
  The symposium participants held: The five Central China 
provinces have always been China's key agricultural commodities 
production bases and have been rich in energy resources, raw and 
processed goods and materials, labor resources, and advanced and 
convenient communications systems as well, thus being of 
strategic importance to the country's economic development. 
Exploitation and opening up of Central China will be an 
inevitable result of China's coastal opening up. The 
exploitation and opening up of Central China will not only 
provide the country's industrialization with an important 
guarantee but also promote rejuvenation and development of the 
country's hinterland, thereby enhancing the country's national 
economic reserve strength. 
  The symposium participants maintained: Located in the middle 
and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang and along the Chang Jiang, 
Hubei should strive to firmly seize the excellent opportunity at 
the moment to learn from Shanghai's Pudong by simultaneously 
opening up to the outside world and domestic regions and 
simultaneously making full use of foreign and domestic 
resources; open up more overseas and domestic markets; 
expeditiously carry out multilevel, multichannel, and 
omnidirectional opening up; encourage areas where conditions 
allow to develop faster and relatively prosperous areas to 
assist relatively backward areas; bring into full play the 
radiation role of each and every key city and key development 
zone; energetically develop a regional economy; speed up 
regional industrial structural readjustment; and further improve 
regional economic quality with an eye to pressing ahead with the 
economic development of the entire Chang Jiang Valley. 
  The symposium also disclosed: The state will this year draw 
up a regional economic development plan aimed at boosting the 
economic development of Hubei Province, Henan Province, Hunan 
Province, Jiangxi Province, and Anhui Province.

<F P=106> ["Roundup: Suzhou Industrial Park Expected To Blaze Trail in </F>
China's Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Nanjing, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Suzhou -- known as the 
"Oriental Venice" -- in east China's Jiangsu Province, is bound 
to blaze a trail in China's switch to a market economy if it 
makes a success of setting up a Sino-Singapore industrial park. 
  The project, scheduled for completion early next century, is 
the country's current biggest foreign cooperative item. 
  "This is a new mode of cooperation between two governments, 
which has never been seen before," said Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing during a recent tour of the city. 
  "It is a strategic step, rather than a commercial measure," 
he said. 
  The establishment of special economic zones, open coastal 
cities, economic and technology development zones in the coastal 
areas and the opening up of border trade have greatly 
facilitated China's economic development and opening further to 
the outside world. 
  But China is not resting on its laurels. 
  In November last year, when Jiang Zemin, Chinese president 
and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, met with 
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at Seattle, in the 
United States, Jiang said that the Chinese Government regarded 
Singapore's experience in developing its country as important, 
and valued Sino-Singapore cooperation. 
  He highly commended the joint efforts to build and develop 
the Suzhou industrial park, which "will create a new mode in 
Sino- Singapore cooperation." 
  Zhang Xinsheng, mayor of Suzhou, said the project is 
characterized by drawing a great deal of international capital 
and Singapore's experience in combining economic operation with 
public administration. 
  "Construction of the Suzhou industrial park will be in line 
with Singapore's experience in urban planning, management and 
social insurance," Zhang said. 
  So far, the two countries have set up a joint development 
company to take charge of the development of the project, open 
bidding and to raise funds. 
  The two governments have set up the Suzhou Industrial Park 
Joint Coordinating Council, chaired by Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. 
  The council, which has two working committees, is 
responsible 
for major issues regarding the park. 
  According to the agreement concluded by the two governments, 
the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee will play an 
independent operational role in line with Chinese law and 
regulations and the requirements of the socialist market economy. 
  These organizations are now operating smoothly.

  [Text] The forum on anticorruption work of some organs 
under the provincial government held in Jinan on the morning of 
23 June pointed out: We should correctly understand the 
situation of this year's anticorruption campaign and concentrate 
efforts on major points to ensure the even greater results of 
the campaign. 
  After listening to the report of the anticorruption 
situation 
of departments concerned, Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of the 
province, said: Since the beginning of this year, party 
committees and governments at various levels in the province 
have achieved outstanding results in opposing corruption. 
According to the survey of 131 units directly under the 
provincial authorities, 24 cars bought in violation of state 
regulations were ferreted out; 22 imported 3,000-cc sedans were 
secured; 2,592 unreasonable financial levies were canceled, 
which would reduce financial levies by 250 million yuan; 228 
economic entities run by party and government organs were 
abolished; 6,378 economic entitles run by party and government 
organs were forced to separate themselves from party and 
government organs; and 125 overseas tourist teams were canceled, 
which would save some 8.12 million yuan in expenses. 
  For the next step of anticorruption work, Zhang Ruifeng set 
three demands: First, leading cadres should effect new progress 
in maintaining high standards of ethical integrity. They should 
talk and behave in strict accordance with the new five-point 
regulations set forth by the central authorities this year, 
should correct mistakes as quickly as possible, and should exert 
great efforts in yielding practical results. Second, new 
progress should be made in the work of correcting unhealthy 
trends. This year, the priorities of this work are to clear up 
unwarranted pooling of funds and arbitrary requisition of 
donations and exaction of fees from enterprises, to screen the 
overseas tours with public funds, to prevent party and 
government organs from sharing the interests of enterprises 
without compensation, and to vigorously check the evil trends 
prominently existing among departments and trades. Third, a new 
breakthrough should be made in investigating and handling major 
and appalling cases.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has pledged 
to develop a new type of "vegetable basket" within the coming 
three years. 
  The Shanghai Municipal Government has formed a special 
committee for the project headed by Mayor Huang Ju and leaders 
of departments such as the agriculture commission, finance and 
trade office and financial bureau. 
  With the development of the urban economy the land in the 
suburbs is sure to be developed. To ensure sufficient land for 
planting vegetables Shanghai has allocated 200 million yuan for 
the development of 5,000 ha of vegetable land on the city 
outskirts. Some bases for breeding of pigs, chickens and ducks 
have also been removed. 
  At present, annually 10,000 tons of high-quality vegetables 
are supplied to the markets of Shanghai. The scale of livestock 
raising is growing. 
  The continuous raising of prices through market circulation 
used to be the main problem for vegetable projects. The city is 
now taking measures to develop direct sales. Many large 
enterprises and higher learning institutions are provided with 
vegetables directly by the vegetable bases. This year the 
municipal government has invested in the construction of 13 
secondary agricultural product wholesale markets. 
  The Shanghai Municipal Government has made a rule that in 
every district and street, within 300 m to 500 m, there must be 
at least one vegetable market. 
  The mayor said that the new "vegetable basket project" must 
be completed within three years.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is to make a 
TV series recalling the city's humanitarianism towards European 
Jews trying to escape from Hitler's holocaust in the years 
before and during the second world war. 
  The history series is to be called "Shanghai Ark." It will 
show how Shanghai people helped the Jews and sheltered them 
while many other countries and ports refused to accept the 
Jewish refugees. 
  About 10,000 Jewish refugees from European countries came to 
Shanghai from 1933 to 1941. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin said in a visit to Shanghai in 1993 that when the Jews 
were being killed by the Nazi regime and forced to leave home 
and wander about, the Shanghai people gave refuge to them. 
Rabin expressed gratitude to the people of Shanghai. 
  The TV series is expected to be shown at the end of the 
year. 
It will be dedicated to the commemoration of the 50th 
anniversary of the end of World War II.

  [Text] Inefficient state enterprises will be closed down or 
declared bankrupt despite a 250 billion yuan (HK$223 billion) 
fund earmarked for technological developments by the Chinese 
Government, according to a senior government official. State 
Economic and Trade Commission vice-director Xu Penghang recently 
revealed that the Government had allocated 250 billion yuan this 
year to help enterprises upgrade their production technology. 
  However, priority would be given to existing market leaders, 
which would receive up to 70 per cent of the allocation. The 
standard of the firms' present management and production would 
be the prime indicators in selecting the enterprises, Mr Xu 
said. Unlike previously, Mr Xu said some of the cash would be 
made available to joint-venture and township enterprises. 
  Reviewing the developments between 1990 and 1993 -- the 
first 
three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan -- Mr Xu said the state 
had spent 467.9 billion yuan on technological improvements. 
About 60 per cent of this was used to increase variety and 
improve product quality. But Mr Xu said much of the cash had 
been wasted on fixed-asset investments, and the portion actually 
used for technology improvements had declined over the years. 
  Some enterprises were preoccupied with expanding their 
business and neglected the importance of product quality, the 
vice-director said. He worried that if such a trend was not 
reversed, the demand for Chinese products would decrease. 
  Mr Xu said the actual growth in productivity in China was 
very slow, despite rapid industrial expansion. Although China 
had overtaken both Japan and the United States in the production 
of many industrial products, China lagged far behind in terms of 
sales volumes when compared with Japan and the U.S. because of 
the low value-addition of Chinese products, he said. 
  Beijing sources said the senior echelon hoped the allocation 
of more money for technological improvements would help the 
state industry narrow the gap with its Western counterparts.

<F P=106> ["Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties" -- </F>
approved at the 16th Executive Meeting of the State Council on 
25 March 1994] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- Formulating an 
industrial policy is an important means of the state to 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
effectively adjust and optimize industrial structure, raise the 
qualities of industries, and promote sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy. To implement the 
guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the decision 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
and based on the current conditions and trend of our country's 
economic development, the "Outline of State Industrial Policy in 
the Nineties" is herein formulated as a guide and basis for 
making various industrial policies in the future. 
  The following principles must be observed in formulating the 
state industrial policy. 1) The industrial policy must conform 
to objective laws of the industrialization and modernization 
process and must be in close touch with China's national 
conditions and the characteristics of the changes of its 
industrial structure; 2) It must accord with the requirement of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure and bring 
into full play the fundamental role of the market in resource 
allocation under the state's macroeconomic regulation and 
control; 3) It must give prominence to what is important and 
concentrate efforts on resolving major issues affecting the 
entire national economy; 4) It must be operable and must 
primarily use economic, legal, and necessary administrative 
measures to guarantee its implementation, and it must support 
the development of industries and products in short supply and 
restrain the development of industries and products in excessive 
supply. 
  The major tasks to be tackled by the state's industrial 
policy in the nineties are: to continue strengthening the role 
of agriculture as the foundation and develop the rural economy 
in an all-around way; vigorously strengthen basic industries and 
strive to ameliorate the situation in which infrastructures and 
basic industries lag behind to a serious degree; step up the 
development of pillar industries to promote all-around 
revitalization of the national economy; rationally adjust 
foreign economic and trade structures to enhance the 
international competitiveness of our industries; accelerate the 
pace of developing high- and new-technology industries and 
support the development of new industries and products; and 
continue the vigorous efforts to develop tertiary industries. 
At the same time, it should optimize the industrial 
organization and structure, raise industries' technological 
level, and make the industrial distribution more rational. 
<H5>  I. Vigorously Develop Agriculture and the Rural Economy and </H5>
Increase Peasants' Income 
  Vigorously developing agriculture and the rural economy and 
increasing peasants' income are the primary task of our 
country's economic development in the nineties. We must firmly 
cultivate an awareness of farming as understood in the broader 
sense to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, 
sideline production, and fishery in an all-around way; 
vigorously develop the type of farming that provides high yields 
of fine quality with maximum efficiency capable of earning 
foreign exchanges; and bring the volume, variety, and quality of 
farm produce to a level that will meet the demands of a nation 
with a relatively comfortable standard of living and the demands 
of the international market. We must rationally adjust the 
rural industrial structure, actively develop secondary and 
tertiary industries in the countryside, gradually shift the 
surplus labor force in rural areas, and raise the overall rural 
production capacity and economic efficiency to a new level. 
  In developing agriculture and the rural economy, it is 
essential to seriously implement the policies and measures which 
have already been laid down by the party Central Committee and 
the State Council, and to carry out the "agricultural 
development program of China for the nineties." It is necessary 
to extend the term for contracting cultivated land; and to 
stabilize and further improve the household contract 
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output as the 
main form, as well as the dual management system which combines 
household with collective operations. It is necessary to 
rationally restructure agricultural production organizations and 
to promote new forms of production organization, such as 
integration of crop cultivation, aquaculture and processing, and 
integrated management of agriculture, trade and industry. It is 
necessary to cultivate the rural market and to establish sound 
systems of protective grain prices, of grain risk funds, and of 
grain reserves. It is necessary to establish and keep improving 
a socialized service system for agriculture and to form a 
three-tier service network of the state, the collective, and the 
local people. It is necessary to seriously protect cultivated 
land, gradually establish basic farmland reservations, and 
formulate relevant procedures for their management. Both the 
central and the local governments should increase agricultural 
investment year by year and support the industry for 
agricultural production. At the same time, the peasants should 
be guided to increase investment in production and encouraged to 
use foreign capital in agricultural development. It is 
necessary to actively use and popularize new, suitable 
agricultural techniques and to advance agriculture through the 
application of science and promotion of education. It is 
necessary to reduce peasants' burdens and protect their 
interests and legitimate rights. 
  While agricultural productivity is being raised, making a 
rational relocation of the rural surplus labor force is an 
important measure for promoting agriculture and rural economic 
development and increasing peasants' income. A further step 
should be taken to accelerate the development of village and 
town enterprises, particularly those in the central and western 
regions. It is necessary to improve planning and provide policy 
guidance to bring about proper concentration of village and town 
enterprises. It is necessary to make full use of and transform 
existing small towns, and to build new small towns. 
  It is necessary to implement seriously the plan set by the 
party Central Committee and the State Council for aiding the 
poor, and to basically solve the problem of food and clothing 
for 80 million people in poor regions within seven years. 
<H5>  II. Conscientiously Strengthen Infrastructure and Basic </H5>
Industries 
  While our infrastructure and basic industries are lagging 
far 
behind our economic development as a whole, efforts should be 
made to resolve such a contradiction and to gradually make the 
former catch up and keep pace with the latter. It is necessary 
to adhere to the principle of "making overall plans and a 
rational geographic distribution, giving prominence to what is 
important, doing our best according to our capability, and 
stressing economic efficiency" to accelerate infrastructural 
construction and the development of basic industries. 
  In the transport industry, a higher priority should be given 
to enhancing the transport capability of railroads and efforts 
should be focused on the development of large transport 
passages. It is necessary to take full advantage of various 
conveyances, including highways, water transport, air transport, 
and pipes, and to accelerate the construction of a comprehensive 
transport system. The telecommunications industry should aim for 
high speed, good quality, and a large scale; actively introduce 
advanced world-class technology and equipment; strive to 
increase the proportion of equipment produced by our own country 
as soon as possible; and vigorously promote the phased-in 
construction of high-speed information networks covering 
selected regions. Energy industries should pursue the policy of 
stressing both exploitation and conservation and ensure a 
coordinated development of energy sources, the economy, and the 
environment. Of them, the coal industry should accelerate the 
construction of key state-owned coal mines and promote the 
transformation and improvement of local mines, including 
township and town mines. The petroleum industry should 
stabilize the eastern region, develop the western region, find 
more petroleum deposits, and make rational use of foreign 
resources. The electric power industry should adhere to the 
principle of considering local conditions, developing both 
hydro-electric and thermo-electric power generation, and 
properly developing nuclear power generation. It is necessary 
to strengthen and improve existing water conservancy facilities, 
make comprehensive efforts to harness selected major rivers and 
lakes, prevent soil erosion, protect and rationally allocate 
water resources, enhance the ability to combat floods and 
droughts, and gradually solve the water supply problem of 
regions and urban areas with water shortages. It is necessary 
to accelerate the development of urban public utilities in 
accordance with the principle of "unified planning, rational 
distribution, comprehensive development, and coordinated 
construction." 
  To accelerate the infrastructural construction and the 
development of basic industries, the state will mainly adopt the 
following policies: to give full play to both central 
initiative and local initiative and establish a system under 
which the duties of the governments at various levels are 
clearly defined; to formulate specific plans for infrastructure 
and basic industries and promote their healthy development; to 
institute and keep improving a policy-oriented long-term 
investment system and a long-term policy-lending system and 
provide policy-oriented financial support to 
government-encouraged construction projects; to encourage and 
guide the use of private funds in the construction of 
infrastructure and basic industries, and consider first the need 
of infrastructural construction and the development of basic 
industries when issuing shares and bonds; to expand the scale 
and area of using foreign capital and encourage foreign 
businessmen to make direct investment in infrastructure and 
basic industries; to further harmonize the relations of prices, 
give play to the important regulatory role of the pricing 
mechanism, and continue and strengthen government control of the 
prices of monopolized goods and services; to continue the policy 
of low-priced land requisition for infrastructure and basic 
industries; to spend government income from the sale of land 
resources on the construction of infrastructure; and with 
approval, to let investors of transport facilities enjoy higher 
priority in obtaining the right to engage in real estate 
development and business along communications lines and in the 
vicinity of harbors and airports, as a comprehensive economic 
compensation. 
  III. Take Active Efforts To Invigorate Pillar 
Industries 
  We should strive to accelerate the development of the 
electronic, machinery, petrochemical, automobile, and 
construction industries and turn them into pillar industries for 
the national economy. 
  The development of the machinery industry should focus on 
the 
manufacturing of basic machine-tools, basic spare parts, and 
whole-set equipment which requires key technologies in an effort 
to optimize product mix, improve its technical standard, and 
enhance its market competition. The electronic industry should 
speed up its modernization on the basis of manufacturing 
microelectronic components and telecommunications equipment, 
computers, and other newly emerging information products as the 
mainstay. The petrochemical industry should make active efforts 
to expand its production and enhance its technical level and 
processing ability. The automobile industry should act as 
quickly as possible to form a production system with fewer 
plants but high production, and to establish a market where 
competition is orderly, and it should increase its share of the 
domestic market and competitiveness on the international market. 
The construction industry should focus on housing projects in 
urban and rural areas, the state's key projects, and urban 
construction. It should actively build a unified, open, 
competitive, and orderly market and improve the quality of 
construction products. 
  To accelerate the development of pillar industries, the 
state 
will adopt the following measures: The state will formulate and 
promulgate a unified industrial policy and guarantee its 
implementation by legal means. The state will gradually 
establish an investment and lending system which is beneficial 
to the development of pillar industries. The state will also 
set up a standardized mechanism enabling enterprises to have 
direct access to loans. In its annual plan for issuing stocks 
and bonds, the state will make priority arrangements for pillar 
industries. The government will support pillar industries in 
developing technologies in some important fields by providing 
financial and material assistance. With the approval of the 
State Council, a small number of large-scale enterprising groups 
will be endorsed with a right to directly borrow and underwrite 
overseas loans commensurate with their capital and income. In 
accordance with international practices and articles of relevant 
agreements, some products of pillar industries will be treated 
as products of infant industry and given suitable protection for 
a set period of time. Meanwhile, part of the domestic market 
will be conditionally opened to foreign products in exchange for 
key technologies and equipment. 
<H5>  IV. Active Efforts Should Be Taken To Develop Foreign </H5>
Economic Ties and Trade 
  We should continue to expand our foreign trade, actively 
readjust the trade structure, bring our advantages into play, 
and greatly enhance the economic performance of our exports to 
facilitate and optimize the industrial structure, strengthen 
international competition, and maintain the international 
balance of payments. 
  The state encourages increasing exports of the following 
products: farm and sideline products with fairly good advantages 
for competition in foreign markets, products of light industry 
and the textile industry, household electronic and electrical 
appliances manufactured with almost matured technologies, 
products with high added value and with the ability to compete 
on the international markets, and high-tech products. The state 
does not encourage exports in bulk of resource-type products 
which are in short supply domestically. The state will 
gradually reduce exports of primary products and products which 
require a large amount of energy to produce. Exports of some 
products will be limited or prohibited. 
  The state encourages importing new technologies as well as 
relevant key equipments and key spare parts. It will suitably 
increase imports of some primary products which are in short 
supply domestically. It will assist infant industries to 
accelerate the pace of importing, assimilating, and absorbing 
new technologies as well as producing new equipments and key 
spare parts. The state does not encourage imports of high-price 
consumption products. 
  As far as readjusting the structure of foreign economic ties 
and trade is concerned, the state will adopt the following 
measures: It will bring into play the important role of the 
Import and Export Bank of China and assist enterprises to 
increase their export of whole-set equipment as well as 
machine-tools and electrical equipment. For some products under 
quantitative import or export controls, a system of bidding, 
auction, and regulated distribution will be used in accordance 
with the principle of economic effectiveness, fairness, and 
openness. It will improve the policy which aims to promote 
export of intensively processed products and high value-added 
products. The state will endorse various qualified enterprises 
with a right to engage in foreign trade and encourage 
large-scale enterprises (groups) to set up direct sale channels 
in foreign countries. The state will rationally readjust tariff 
rates in accordance with its industrial policy. 
  V. Industrial Organization, Industrial Technology, 
and Industrial Distribution 
  1. The policy governing industrial organizations aims at 
promoting rational competition among enterprises and establising 
economies of scale and cooperation between specialized 
departments so that an industrial organizational structure in 
line with the technological and economic characteristics of 
industry and China's economic development stages can be formed. 
A market structure with a small number of large enterprises 
(groups) acting as the main competitors shall be formed in 
industries which have pronounced effects on the development of 
economies of scale; a market structure of an appropriate size 
characterized by rational division of work and cooperation among 
large, medium-sized, and small enterprises shall be formed in 
industries which produce large quantities of spare parts and 
components; and in industries where results of the development 
of economies of scale are not pronounced, the development of 
small enterprises should be encouraged so that a 
competition-based market structure can be formed where a rather 
large number of large, medium-sized, and small enterprises 
coexist. 
  To attain the above objective, it is necessary to take the 
following readjustment measures: To progressively introduce 
market mechanisms and encourage rational competition among 
naturally monopolistic regional industries; and to continuously 
draw up standards governing the minimum production scale for 
industrial enterprises and products which have pronounced 
effects on the development of economies of scale. At the same 
time, it is essential to break the barriers between different 
regions or departments and restrict or even prohibit the 
development of projects falling short of the standards set for 
economies of scale so as to promote the establishment of 
economies of scale. To encourage enterprises to act 
independently in reorganizing themselves or forming themselves 
into public- and private-owned transregional, transdepartmental, 
and even transnational business conglomerates, doing so through 
fair competition, merger, takeover, and holding each other's 
stocks. We should accelerate the formulation of laws and 
regulations governing market competition to create an external 
environment favorable to fair competition among enterprises and 
readjustment of enterprise organizational structure. 
  2. The industrial technology policy should give priority to 
promoting development of applied technology, encouraging the 
integration of scientific research and production, accelerating 
the popularization of scientific and technological achievements, 
promoting the introduction and assimilation of advanced foreign 
technology, markedly improving our products' quality and 
technical functions, significantly reducing energy and material 
consumption as well as production cost, and striving to upgrade 
the technology of Chinese industry. 
  The state will take the following measures to promote 
technological advancement in industry: To increase all kinds of 
investment in scientific and technological research and 
development through various channels and gradually increase the 
proportion of investment in the gross national product; to draw 
up and implement technological research and development programs 
significant for the development of different industries so as to 
support and encourage them to assimilate and absorb advanced 
imported technology and to make innovations; to strengthen 
planning for high- and new-technology industries and do a good 
job in building high- and new-technology development zones 
approved by the state; to push forward the process of 
standardization and serialization and promote the use of 
international standards, advanced foreign standards, and even 
stricter in-house standards for enterprises; to enhance 
enterprises' ability to independently develop new products, 
encourage enterprises to strengthen ties with institutes of 
higher learning and scientific research, and speed up the 
commercialization of scientific and technological achievements; 
and to regularly publish, in the form of laws and regulations, 
backward production technology and equipment that must be phased 
out. 
  3. The main principle for the policy governing industrial 
distribution is: While continuing to give play to the economic 
strengths of relatively developed regions and accelerate their 
development, it is necessary to aid economic development in less 
developed regions and gradually narrow the gap between 
economically developed regions and less developed regions. The 
state supports the development of industrial belts which give 
play to their natural resources and economic strengths and in 
which specialized departments in various regions divide their 
work and cooperate. 
  To gradually set up a rational pattern of industrial 
distribution along the coasts, rivers, railroads, and frontiers, 
large cities located along main lines of communications should 
act as centers to bring along the development of major economic 
regions. To achieve sustained, rapid, economic growth and better 
efficiency, the eastern coastal region should utilize more 
foreign capital and resources in vigorously developing an 
export-oriented economy, especially technology-intensive 
industries and products which have high added-value and foreign 
exchange earning capability and which can economize on the 
consumption of energy and raw and semifinished materials. The 
central and western regions should harness their resources and 
utilize the border regions' geographic proximity of opening to 
the outside world in striving to develop industries and products 
capitalizing on such advantages. The state will gradually shift 
preferential economic policies in investments, loans, project 
distribution, and foreign capital use from regions to 
industries, and will give necessary assistance to major projects 
for development and construction of the central and western 
regions. The state will support the central and western regions 
in developing village and township enterprises, and will 
encourage economically developed regions to engage in joint 
development, technological cooperation, regular cooperation in 
related departments, and personnel exchange with the central and 
western regions. 
  We should make the best use of circumstances to guide the 
healthy development of urbanization, setting up an urban 
construction system with harmoniously structured and rationally 
distributed large, medium, and small cities. 
<H5>  VI. The Procedures for Formulating Industrial Policies and </H5>
Their Implementation 
  Industrial policy is made up of policies on industrial 
structure, policies on industrial organization, policies on 
industrial technology, policies on industrial distribution, and 
other policies and regulations having an important bearing on 
industrial development. To ensure the industrial policy's 
scientific nature and authority as well as its effectiveness, 
the following provisions on the formulation and implementation 
of industrial policies are especially made: 
  1. State industrial policy must be decided by the State 
Council. The State Planning Commission is the comprehensive 
department specifically in charge of studying, formulating, and 
coordinating state industrial policy. The State Planning 
Commission will take the lead and coordinate with the relevant 
departments in formulating various industrial policies. 
Industrial policy will be implemented mainly by relevant 
leading departments of their trades at the central level, with 
the State Planning Commission making overall coordination. 
  2. A system for deliberating state industrial policy must be 
established. Industrial policy and policies having an important 
bearing on industrial development, which are drafted by the 
relevant departments, must be examined and coordinated by the 
State Planning Commission. They must go through scientific 
assessment and democratic deliberation organized by the State 
Planning Commission and participated in by the State Council's 
relevant departments, industrial and academic circles, and 
consumer organizations before they are submitted by the State 
Planning Commission together with the relevant departments to 
the State Council for approval, promulgation, and implementation. 
  3. A system for guaranteeing the implementation of the state 
industrial policy must be established. Planning, finance, 
banking, tax, domestic and foreign trade, tariff, security 
market supervision, industry and commerce administration, state 
asset management, and other economic management departments must 
earnestly implement state industrial policy and must coordinate 
with the State Planning Commission before formulating a major 
policy concerning industrial development. 
  4. A system for supervising, inspecting, and evaluating 
state industrial policy must be established. The State Planning 
Commission together with the relevant departments are 
responsible for supervising, inspecting, and analyzing the 
implementation of industrial policy; for making periodical 
reports to the State Council on the progress and results in the 
implementation; and for making suggestions for improvement based 
on changes in the economic situation and industrial structure. 
  5. Local people's governments at the provincial level must, 
on the basis of this outline's requirements and in the light of 
the realities in each locality, study and formulate specific 
rules for implementation and report them to the State Planning 
Commission for the record. 
  6. Based on this outline's requirements, the state will in 
the near future formulate a draft industrial policy governing 
the transportation, communication, construction, electronics, 
machinery, and petrochemical industries, as well as on foreign 
capital, foreign trade, technology, and restructuring of 
industrial organizations. The State Planning Commission will be 
in charge of organizing and coordinating the formulation of 
policies. 
  7. The State Planning Commission is responsible for 
interpreting this outline. 
  This outline will be implemented on the day of promulgation. 
  Appendix: 
<H5>  Several Provisions Concerning the Enforcement of the </H5>
Standard of Economic Scale on Fixed Asset Investment Projects 
(the First Batch) 
  To help readjust the industrial structure and enterprise 
organizational setup, to bring into full play the advantage of 
economies of scale, to increase the investment returns of 
construction projects, and to make Chinese products more 
competitive on international markets, the following provisions 
are made concerning the enforcement of the standard of economic 
scale on fixed asset investment projects for a few fast-selling 
products in short market supply and having relatively 
conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale production: 
  1. The standard of economic scale for fixed asset investment 
projects is referred to the reasonable construction scale for 
projects that have been recently built or expanded, and have 
their technology upgraded in the 1990s. The standard of 
economic scale is a major component of the state industrial 
policy and an important basis for reviewing and approving fixed 
asset investment projects. People's governments at various 
levels and all relevant departments, as well as enterprises of 
all types (including foreign-funded enterprises), should comply 
with the standard. 
  2. Construction projects meeting the standard of economic 
scale still need to be submitted for examination and approval 
according to the existing procedures; projects below the 
standard of economic scale are, in principle, not approved. 
However, special consideration will be given to construction 
projects below the standard of economic scale in remote regions 
with poor transport facilities and economic backwardness. In 
such cases, units preparing for construction must first explain 
the reasons for the construction and report them to the relevant 
departments for examination and approval; and then, based on the 
division of work between capital construction and technical 
transformation, submit a construction project proposal and a 
feasibility report, respectively, to the State Planning 
Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission for 
examination and approval. 
  3. The state encourages industrial departments, local 
governments, and enterprises to cooperate in setting up limited 
liability companies or limited liability stock companies to meet 
the standard of economic scale for construction projects. For 
projects meeting the standard of economic scale, banks should 
give preferential support in terms of loans and use of foreign 
exchange. With the approval of the State Council or its 
authorized agency, units in charge of such projects may issue 
stocks or shares to raise construction funds in accordance with 
the procedures stipulated by the state. 
  4. The State Council shall authorize the State Planning 
Commission to work together with the relevant departments in 
publishing successively the standard of economic scale of 
products with conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale 
production, and in making timely revisions of the scale 
according to the development of national economy.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ni Guohe (0242 0948 0735)] </F>
  [Text] The Fourth Shanghai Lawyers Congress opened 
yesterday morning at the Education Hall in a bid to raise the 
quality of lawyers in Shanghai and to accelerate the pace of 
reforming the lawyer work. Justice Minister Xiao Yang attended 
the opening ceremony and set demands on the Shanghai lawyers' 
work. 
  Shanghai now boasts 108 law firms and the number of people 
involved in the law profession stands at 3,647. Lawyers are now 
serving as legal consultants for some 20,000 units and 
individuals in the municipality. At the opening ceremony, 
Minister Xiao Yang expressed the hope that Shanghai lawyers 
would seize the opportunity, understand thoroughly their 
historical mission, and play an active role in promoting and 
developing a market economy. At the same time, he called on the 
broad mass of law workers to provide quality legal services to 
help maintain a normal market economic order, the government 
carry out macroeconomic regulation and control in developing a 
market economy, and bring about a virtuous economic cycle in 
society and a steady increase of economic and social benefits. 
He added that lawyers should provide quality legal consultation 
and legal services to help develop production, distribution, and 
consumption, form a social security system, and further ensure 
social stability and protect the citizens' democratic and 
legitimate rights and benefits. He called on them to constantly 
raise their professional level and promote the constant 
development of reform and opening up. 
  The current meeting will discuss the issues on law firm 
operation and on developing mechanisms for voluntary law-firm 
mergers, for law-firm autonomy, and for self-development and 
self-restraint. The "Shanghai Lawyers' Association 
Constitution" will be examined and revised at the congress. 
Congress participants will also elect the fourth board of 
directors for the Shanghai Lawyers' Association.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "First Arbitration Law Drafted"] </F>
  [Text] China's first commercial arbitration law based on a 
United Nations model is being drafted. 
  A senior Chinese arbitrator said the Model Law, which was 
adopted by the UN Commission on International Trade Law 
(Uncitral) in 1985, would help bring the Chinese law closer to 
international practices. 
  The draft version of the law is being discussed by China's 
highest legislative body, the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress. 
  But some sensitive issues are yet to be resolved before the 
law is approved. 
  First, there is the question whether ad hoc arbitration will 
be allowed in China, where disputes have up until now been 
settled by institutional arbitration. 
  Ad hoc arbitration costs less money and time for feuding 
parties than institutional solutions. 
  Second is whether China should adopt a uniform arbitration 
law for both international and domestic commercial disputes. 
  Despite these issues, there seems to be a general consensus 
that arbitration should be independent from administrative 
organizations to ensure fairer judgments. 
  At the moment, the country's arbitration regulations are 
part 
of the Law of Civil Procedure. But the first national 
arbitration law will be separate from the civil procedure law. 
  Tang Houzhi, vice-chairman of the China International 
Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac), said China 
can learn from advanced international experiences. 
  Cietac and the International Council for Commercial 
Arbitration (Icca) organized the International Commercial 
Arbitration Conference in Beijing last week. 
  It was the first time an Icca meeting was held in a 
developing country. 
  But developing countries are playing a more important role 
in 
international commercial arbitration, said Tang. 
  Last year China topped the world's 80 arbitration centres in 
terms of numbers of cases handled. 
  Arbitration awards made by Cietac must be enforced by 
countries that adhere to the 1958 New York Convention. 
  China joined the Convention in 1958 but did not implement it 
until 1987. 
  Xu Dayou, another Cietac vice-chairman, revealed that the 
biggest dispute handled by his organization so far involved $30 
million. 
  Cietac, China's sole international commercial arbitration 
body, has dealt with disputes arising from a growing number of 
sectors, including real estate, leasing and joint venture 
contracts. 
  Unlike most Western centres, Cietac combines arbitration 
with 
conciliation. 
  The disadvantage of arbitration is that an award can leave a 
lasting bitterness between the disputing parties. But 
successful combination of arbitration and conciliation can 
satisfy both sides. 
  Tang said China's model can be spread throughout the 
Asia-Pacific region.

  [Text] Hohhot, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Cao Tiandian, director of 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said today 
at the National Work Conference on the Management of Enterprise 
Registration that the system of company registration would be 
drastically adjusted in conjunction with the formal 
implementation of the "Company Law of the People's Republic of 
China" on 1 July. 
  With the enforcement of the "Company Law," the direction of 
China's enterprise reform will shift from a mere granting of 
more power to enterprises to that of a systematic change, or to 
establishing a modern enterprise system. Straightening out 
property rights relationships and defining the corporate 
property rights of enterprises are at the center of this system. 
The corporate system will be adopted as the major form of 
promoting the system. 
  To achieve that end, the company registration system will 
make a break with the former ownership registration system; 
instead it will emphasize enterprise property. For instance, 
registered capital (fund provider uses this to undertake 
company's limited liability) will replace registered funds (no 
stipulation on undertaking what kind of responsibility toward 
the company) to reflect in a timely manner corporate property 
rights. The new system will merge operational methods and 
scopes into one and term them operational scope to realize the 
granting of autonomous operation rights to enterprises. 
Starting from the day of the implementation of the "Company 
Law," and excluding stipulations provided for separately in the 
state laws and administrative regulations, the fund provider 
shall directly apply for registration with the administrative 
organs for industry and commerce; thus scrapping the examination 
and approval by competent administrative departments. Local 
laws and provisions, administrative rules, and other documents 
relating to trade and commerce management departments' special 
examination and approval will cease to be the prerequisite 
conditions for registration. 
  Cao Tiandian said the State Council will soon promulgate 
"Regulations on Management of Enterprise Registration of the 
People's Republic of China." The "regulations," he said, will 
provide specific stipulations to the principles set down in the 
"Company Law." He added that the pace of drafting a number of 
documents to complement the "Company Law" has been accelerated.

<F P=106> ["Views on Economic Life" column article by staff reporter </F>
Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030): "How To View the Joint Ventures 
Launched by State-Owned Enterprises and Overseas Firms"] 
  [Text] There are two forms of joint ventures launched by 
state-owned enterprises and overseas companies. First, the 
state-owned enterprise provides part of its assets to establish 
a new enterprise with the overseas investor, and the state-owned 
enterprise -- being one partner of the joint venture -- 
continues to exist. Most joint ventures launched by state-owned 
enterprises and overseas investors have adopted this form. 
Second, the state-owned enterprise contributes the whole of its 
assets to form a joint venture with overseas investment, and the 
original state-owned enterprise does not exist independently 
after being merged into the joint venture. Not many 
Chinese-foreign joint ventures have adopted this second form yet. 
  Using external capital is a major measure for accelerating 
the process of modernization in our country, and further 
increasing the use of external capital is also an invariable 
policy laid down by our government. The joint ventures launched 
by state-owned enterprises and overseas investors will promote 
the reform and development of our state-owned enterprises. In 
general, joint ventures are set up according to the modern 
enterprise system, and they will provide useful experience for 
the reform of the state-owned enterprises. Some state-owned 
enterprises are facing "two systems," and directly feel the 
competition pressure from the joint ventures so that they have 
accelerated the transformation of the management mechanism. The 
use of foreign capital also will play a role in prompting 
state-owned enterprises to make technological progress, enhance 
the management level, and upgrade products. Therefore, it is 
necessary to continue to support the joint ventures launched by 
state-owned enterprises and overseas investors. 
  At present, using external capital to accelerate development 
has become the consensus of all the people, and state-owned 
enterprises in all localities have great enthusiasm for 
launching joint ventures. Some localities even proposed that 
foreign investment be grafted onto all state-owned enterprises, 
thus turning them into joint ventures, and some localities 
offered excessive favors to the joint ventures in order to 
achieve quick results, and the loose management over the joint 
ventures led to the loss of state assets. In the course of using 
external capital, should all state-owned enterprises be turned 
into joint ventures? How should we prevent the loss of state 
assets? We need to understand these questions correctly and 
approach them seriously. 
  Continuing to expand the use of external capital and to 
support the joint ventures launched by state-owned enterprises 
and overseas investors does not mean that everything has to be 
based on a joint venture. Still less does this mean that all 
state-owned enterprises have to be turned into joint ventures. 
The market economy we are pursuing is a socialist market 
economy, which will continue to maintain the predominant 
position of socialist public ownership. Of course, this does 
not mean that state-owned enterprises will monopolize all trades 
in all localities without discrimination. Rather, this means 
primarily that the public assets will account for a predominant 
proportion in gross social assets and that the state-owned 
economy will control the lifeline of the national economy and 
play a leading role in economic development. This is explicitly 
expounded by the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should try to use as much 
foreign capital as possible, but it is unnecessary and also 
impossible for us to turn all state-owned enterprises into joint 
ventures. We should continue to expand the scope of foreign 
investment, but this does not mean that we will completely open 
all sectors of the economy -- especially the lifeline of the 
national economy -- to foreign investment. Some industries may 
be completely opened to foreign investment, some industries may 
be opened with certain limits, and some industries may not be 
opened at all. Some localities and enterprises are anxious to 
seek external investment and set up joint ventures because they 
think that they may spend money to "buy a good mechanism." In 
fact, launching joint ventures is not the only way to invigorate 
state-owned enterprises. As long as we quicken the reform of 
the state-owned enterprises, establish a modern enterprise 
system, and further transform their operational mechanisms, 
state-owned enterprises certainly will increase their vigor and 
dynamism, and will play a great role in economic development, 
especially in the lifeline scope of the national economy. 
  The joint investment made by state-owned enterprises and 
overseas companies should be made positively and also prudently. 
Attention should be paid to preventing the loss of state 
assets. It should be made clear that the joint investment 
itself does not mean the loss of state assets. No matter 
whether the state-owned enterprises provide part or all of their 
assets for the joint ventures, being shareholders, they will 
continue to earn dividends. The development of the joint 
venture also will increase state assets. Even if the original 
state-owned enterprises are merged into the joint ventures in 
the form of auctions, the state assets involved will simply 
change from materials into monetary value and the quantity of 
state assets will not decrease. The Chinese side may have 
monetary income through the auctions and may make reinvestment 
in other enterprises. We must pay attention to preventing any 
loss of state assets in the process of launching joint ventures. 
Some localities gave excessive favors to external investors in 
violation of the state policies, as they were anxious to set up 
more joint ventures. They sold land at low prices, offered 
repeated tax exemptions and reductions, and failed to evaluate 
or underestimated the value of the Chinese side's assets. On 
the other hand, some external investors overestimated the value 
of the equipment they invested or took equipment of poor quality 
as advanced equipment, thus encroaching on the Chinese side's 
assets. Such things must not be allowed to happen. It is 
necessary to more effectively manage the work of inviting 
external investment, to establish perfect regulations, and to 
enhance the quality of investment invitation work. Equality and 
mutual benefit is a basic principle in our use of foreign 
capital. The legitimate rights and interests of external 
businessmen should be protected; the legitimate rights and 
interests of the Chinese side must not be harmed either.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353): "Industrial </F>
Policy -- Directional Indicator for Economic Take-Off"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Industrial policy is 
still a brand new term for the majority of Chinese people. When 
the State Council recently promulgated the "Outline of State 
Industrial Policy in the Nineties," people might not have 
anticipated that in the next decade, a comprehensive rural 
economic system integrated with agriculture, trade, industry, 
communications, construction, and service trades will gradually 
take shape to facilitate an all-around development of the rural 
economy; that the strains on infrastructure and basic industries 
will be greatly alleviated to help the national economy develop 
at a more solid and substantive pace; that along with the rapid 
rise of a number of pillar industries, many people will move 
into new living quarters and drive privately owned vehicles, 
telephones and family computers will no longer be in exclusive 
use by a small number of people, and foreign trade mix and 
conditions will be improved markedly and China will play a 
bigger role in the global economic and trade arena; that 
thriving high- and new-tech industries will bring about a 
noticeable improvement in the organizational structure and 
pattern of industries; and that there will be a big leap in the 
level of industrial technology. All of these will become 
materialized under the guidance of industrial policy, the target 
that the macroeconomic regulation and control is aimed at. 
  China has launched an important program of applying 
industrial policy to guide the national economy to embark on the 
optimal course while bringing into full play the role of markets. 
<H5>  I. </H5>
  To use simple language, industrial policy is aimed mainly at 
readjusting industrial structure. 
  In any country, industrial structure always takes shape in a 
given stage of economic development. Take, for example, China's 
pace-setting industries: In the 1960s and 1970s, light 
industrial products consisting of dozens of components, such as 
bicycles, watches, and sewing machines, became the dominant 
groups of consumer goods. In the 1980s, machinery and 
electrical products consisting of several hundred components, 
such as color television sets, refrigerators, and video 
cassettes, were the vogues of the times. Since the beginning of 
the 1990s, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his talks 
during his southern tour, the Chinese economy has developed 
rapidly. What Chinese people on the street feel right now is 
that the traditional consumer goods are saturated and urgently 
need to be replaced by groups of higher quality capital- and 
technology-intensive consumer goods; and that electronic 
products, automobiles, residential houses, and other new 
products will become leading consumer goods. 
  With the scale of the Chinese economy being multiplied 
several hundredfold as compared with the beginning of the PRC, 
the previous simple management system of a planned economy has 
become outdated, while the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure is not yet complete. As a result, aimless 
development, redundant construction, and low efficiency have 
occurred from time to time. On the one hand, much new capital 
continues to be invested in traditional industries whose 
products have already saturated the markets; on the other, new 
industries which have not reached the threshold of large-scale 
production cannot turn out highly competitive products. Take 
the automobile industry, for example. China has over 120 
automobile plants, more than the total number of plants in the 
world; however, its total output is less than that of a single 
model manufactured by a foreign automobile company. If such a 
situation characterized by laxness, chaos, and poor quality 
remains for a long time to come, taking part in international 
competition can only be an empty slogan. 
  Under the circumstances of developing a socialist market 
economy, the government policymakers and economists are 
anxiously trying to seek a new, effective control and regulatory 
means. 
  They are attracted by the experiences of other countries: A 
few newly developed nations, with foresight in the process of 
developing a market-oriented economy, have their central 
government draw up an industrial policy to standardize and 
encourage industries which can serve as the foundations and 
pacesetters for the national economy, thereby creating a healthy 
situation characterized by both competition and a clear-cut 
direction of development and making optimal and rational 
allocation of resources. For example, Japan and Korea have 
successively developed their automobile and electronics 
industries from weak foundations. However, both countries 
relied on the assistance and interference prescribed in the 
state industrial policy to concentrate national resources and 
prioritize the development of their industries. Through 
assiduous efforts, the Japanese and Korean automobile and 
electronics industries have come to dominate international 
markets while bringing along the rapid growth of the national 
economy and creating world-acclaimed economic miracles. 
  II. 
  Some people once suggested that since China wanted to 
introduce a market economy, it was not necessary to formulate an 
industrial policy as everything would be regulated by market 
mechanisms. However, more experts held that simple market 
regulation would inevitably lead to loss of resources and 
opportunities, which were precisely the things China should 
treasure. Besides, simple market regulation could not guarantee 
the long-term development of agriculture and infrastructure. 
Needless to say, the Asian countries with the same oriental 
cultural background as China's had their central government draw 
up a guiding industrial policy. Even the United States, which 
is known for its free market economy, drew up an industrial 
policy for developing space aviation and other high-technology 
several decades ahead of time. These two views finally 
converged on one point, that is, industrial policy and market 
mechanisms are complementary to each other. On the one hand, 
industrial policy aims to apply economic means to guide the 
direction of industrial development, to change relations between 
different relations so as to remedy defects and shortcomings of 
market mechanisms, to coordinate and accumulate necessary 
capital within a short period of time for carrying out some 
major projects having a bearing on the overall situation, and to 
promote the optimal allocation of resources. On the other hand, 
maintaining the normal operation of market mechanisms and 
promoting fair, equal, and open competition constitute the 
important functions of industrial policy. 
  China first tried to formulate its industrial policy in the 
late 1980s. In March 1989, the State Council, in the light of 
needs at that time, promulgated the "Decision Concerning the 
Main Points of the Current Industrial Policy." The "decision" 
outlined specific names of projects which the government would 
support or restrict in the four areas of production, capital 
construction, technical transformation, and foreign trade; as 
well as a guarantee system. Strictly speaking, it was a policy 
aimed at achieving short-term targets at that time, but it still 
attracted extensive attention from many international 
organizations and economic sectors abroad. 
  Since the early 1990s, the center of global economic 
development has shifted to the Asian-Pacific region. Along with 
China's further opening up and absorption of huge foreign 
capital, the country has become a new economic growth point of 
the Asian-Pacific region. Moreover, in the transition from a 
planned to a market economy, the central government has been 
required to conform with international economic trends in both 
macro and micro economic operational mechanisms to provide 
farsighted guidance for changes in industrial structure and to 
accelerate the pace of China's modernization toward the 21st 
century. Thus, the formulation of an industrial policy for 
long-term allocation of resources was placed on the State 
Council's agenda. 
  In line with the State Council's decision, the State 
Planning 
Commission took the lead in studying and coordinating the 
formulation of an industrial policy. As the commission has been 
changing its functions from drawing up annual plans and 
allocating financial and material resources to drawing up medium 
and long-term plans, the study and formulation of industrial 
policy in the 1990s has become a major task of the commission. 
  Since 1992, the State Planning Commission, in a bid to pool 
collective wisdom, invited economists and representatives from 
departments, localities, and enterprises to various forums; and 
convened a national industrial policy work conference. The 
State Council's leaders personally participated in discussions 
and listened to opinions at the conference. 
  Using as reference foreign countries' successful experiences 
in formulating and implementing industrial policy and in the 
light of the actual conditions in China, the basic principles 
for the state industrial policy in the 1990s have been drawn up: 
1) They conform with the objective law governing the process of 
industrialization and modernization; 2) they conform with the 
demand for establishing a socialist market economic structure; 
3) they underscore the key areas and focus on solving major 
issues having a vital bearing on the overall situation of the 
national economy; and 4) they are feasible and can guarantee the 
implementation of industrial policy through economic, legal, and 
necessary administrative means. 
  In the process of formulating industrial policy, experts 
conducted a host of research on verification of proof, data 
analyses, and prediction of trends. After revisions to 14 
drafts, the current "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the 
Nineties" took shape. After discussion and approval by the 
State Council's 16th executive meeting, it was promulgated for 
implementation. 
  III. 
  The promulgated "Outline of State Industrial Policy in the 
Nineties" contains a group of documents, mainly consisting of 
two parts: 1) A framework of programmatic documents of a 
guidance nature, which involve only agriculture, basic 
industries, infrastructural facilities, and pillar industries, 
and which allow enterprises and the market to play their optimum 
role in the development of a number of key industries such as 
foreign trade; 2) a series of practical special industrial 
policies drawn up on the basis of the "outline." For example, 
the "Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry" and other 
special industrial policies on transportation, communications, 
construction, electronics, machine-building, petrochemical 
industries, and foreign trade, which will be drawn up 
successively. 
  The entrepreneurs of several automobile groups from all 
parts 
of the country said: The "Industrial Policy for the Automobile 
Industry" has enabled China's automobile industry to have a 
direction and basis for healthy development since its 
establishment over four decades ago. The annual production of 
whole sedan manufacturing plants shall not be below 150,000 
units; encouragement of the policy of investment and financing 
through various channels; encouragement of the policy that 
individuals should buy automobiles; discouragement of the policy 
of depending on the state to buy automobiles; encouragement of 
the consumption policy of using small automobiles; overall 
planning for related industries; and other safety policies on 
roads, car parking facilities, and inclusion of teaching of 
traffic knowledge in elementary schools, which are stipulated in 
the industrial policy, will have a decisive impact on the 
reorganization and rapid development of China's automobile 
industry. 
  Whether the state industrial policy drawn up by the central 
government in consideration of overall and long-term interests 
can be successfully turned into a giant motive force for the 
development of the economy in the nineties depends on a secure 
implementation system. According to the arrangements of the 
state, the implementation of the industrial policy will depend 
mainly on the departments in charge of various trades; however, 
it will be implemented under the overall coordination of the 
State Planning Commission. Meanwhile, the establishment of a 
secure system for the implementation of the industrial policy 
and a supervision, checking, and evaluation system should be 
speedily completed. Economic administrative departments dealing 
with planning, finance, banking, taxation, customs, foreign 
trade, securities, industrial and commercial administration, and 
management of state-owned assets will coordinate with one 
another to form a force to push forward the smoother 
implementation of the state industrial policy. 
  According to a disclosure by an authoritative source, in the 
future when the state is drawing up economic policies, it will 
give preferential treatment to industries just as it gave such 
treatment to regions in the past. Morever, the state will 
render necessary support to important industrial projects being 
built in central and western China. 
  The scientific guidance provided by the industrial policy 
will play a sacred role in stimulating the development of 
China's economy.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 24 (CNS) -- The safety problem 
facing foreign-funded enterprises in the Mainland has become an 
immediate concern in the wake of the collapse of a fire-stricken 
textile factory in Zhuhai, which claimed dozens of lives in the 
disaster. The incident indicated that early precaution was 
desperately needed in order to prevent such a tragedy from 
happening again. 
  Serious incidents concerning safety problems that occurred 
in 
foreign-funded enterprises since the beginning of last year 
highlighted the urgent need for precautionary measures. Two 
separate fire cases occurred in a Hong Kong-funded factory in 
Kuiyong Township of Shenzhen and in a Taiwan-funded enterprise 
in Mawei in Fuzhou last November. A sudden collapse happened in 
a toy factory in Shaoguan of Shenzhen early this month. All 
these incidents were very shocking. 
  Worries are aroused because there are so far over 100,000 
foreign-funded enterprises in operation across China, and the 
safety problem is highlighted following these incidents. 
  Surveys carried out by the Shenzhen authorities showed that 
several of these incidents were attributed to man-made factors 
which were in violation of regulations and law, while a survey 
conducted by the Fujian authorities went further to indicate 
that the safety problem facing foreign-funded enterprises was 
very serious, including the locking of fire exit, illegal 
occupation of staircase area, combination of warehouse and 
workshop and no separate storage of inflammable articles, which 
were often kept together with other items. 
  The potentially dangerous situation, which had existed for a 
long time, mainly lay in several reasons. First, a rush of 
introduction of foreign capital led to a simplification of the 
procedures required, which in turn caused neglect of industrial 
safety. Second, it is difficult for supervision and law 
enforcement to be carried out because Chinese management 
personnel employed by a particular foreign-funded enterprise 
were not legitimately empowered to take care of safety affairs. 
Third, foreign-funded enterprises generally tended to 
re-construct their buildings in an unauthorized way, mainly out 
of consideration for profit making. Some foreign businessmen 
went further, ignoring safety of employees because they had 
their factories insured overseas.

<F P=106> [By Yun He: "New Sectors Opened to Lure Foreign Investment"] </F>
  [Text] China announced new policies last week to lure 
foreign investment into such sectors as foreign trade, retail 
sales transportation, financial services civil aviation, real 
estate and information services. 
  Some of the sectors, such as civil aviation, are becoming 
open for the first time, said a government official who asked 
not to be identified. 
  Also under the new policies, foreign trade will be partially 
opened to foreign investors, the official said. 
  Overseas companies can launch joint ventures with local 
partners in bonded areas in China, he said. He declined to give 
further details. 
  The official disclosed that the government is considering 
setting up a Sino-foreign civil aviation joint venture company 
as a trial programme to enhance competitiveness of the domestic 
civil aviation industry on the world market. 
  The new policies will also open different parts of China's 
transportation network to foreign investors. Such things as 
expressways, railways, motor vehicle transportation centres and 
wharfs will be opened. 
  The country will drum up foreign investment to set up plants 
to manufacture passenger railway coaches and launch restaurants 
and motor vehicle maintenance shops along highways. 
  The official also disclosed that one to two supermarkets can 
be set up with foreign investment in each of the major cities 
and special economic zones, including Shanghai, Beijing, 
Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, 
Xiamen and Hainan. 
  The retail stores, however, must be joint ventures including 
Chinese partners. No wholly foreign-owned supermarkets will be 
allowed, he said. 
  The government will limit these joint ventures to retail 
sales only and they are not allowed to carry out whole sale 
business, he added. 
  To develop the financial and tourism sectors, foreign 
companies are now allowed to set up banking institutions in some 
coastal cities and build some tourism facilities in 
State-approved tourist spots across the country; the official 
did not specify which coastal cities would be opened in this way. 
  In the real estate sector, he said, foreign investment will 
be encouraged to help develop large parcels of land. 
  Overseas capital will not only be allowed in residential 
construction but also in the building of key facilities 
involving transportation, telecommunications and water supply 
systems. 
  Foreign-funded real estate projects, however, will be 
required to undergo a thorough examination by the government. 
  Other fields opened under the new policies for foreign 
investment include leasing, accounting, advertising, information 
consultancy, engineering, industrial designing, and schools and 
training centres. 
  The government has managed to guarantee sufficient funds to 
domestic enterprises for setting up key joint ventures projects 
-- mainly industrial, infrastructural and agricultural ones -- 
with foreign partners. 
  In the first five months of this year, China approved 20,230 
foreign-invested projects. The pledged foreign input was $32.7 
billion. 
  By the end of last year, the country cumulatively had 
approved more than 180,000 foreign-funded ventures with $224 
billion worth of pledged foreign capital, making China the top 
haven for international capital investment. 
  A senior government official said China will remain a major 
magnet for international investment due to its high-powered 
technical and industrial bases. 
  In addition, he said, China's vast territory, natural 
resources and cheap labour force are also attractive.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Two-tier Ad Scale To End?"] </F>
  [Text] China is considering unifying advertising charges 
for Chinese and foreigners so both pay the same amount. 
  "We will unify the dual-track advertising-price system as 
soon as China attains its Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade) membership," said an official with the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce. 
  Foreign companies, including overseas-invested firms, have 
to 
pay 30 per cent more than their Chinese counterparts to place 
ads on TV and other media. 
  To prepare for the advertising price reform, the central 
government already is encouraging step-by-step price increases 
for Chinese advertisers, Zheng Heping, deputy director of the 
administration's Advertising Department, told Business Weekly in 
an exclusive interview. Some media outlets have consequently 
increased prices. 
  Zheng stressed that increasing the advertising prices for 
Chinese firms must be accomplished gradually, because the 
central government has to consider affordability for State-owned 
firms in particular. 
  The government also is sensitive to the need to make efforts 
to avoid domination of China's advertising by foreign companies 
when prices are levelled. 
  China Central Television (CCTV) will, on July 1, take the 
lead in raising its average advertising rate to 41,000 yuan 
($4,713) from the current 39,000 yuan ($4,483) for every three 
seconds during prime time. 
  This further increase comes on the heels of a 30 per cent 
price hike by much of the country's media at the beginning of 
this year. 
  Zheng believes other media units and China's 1,605 local 
television stations will soon follow CCTV's move. 
  The increasingly wide coverage of television programmes 
encourages the TV stations to charge much higher advertising 
rates than other media. Television stations account for at 
least 22 per cent of the country's total advertising business 
volume. 
  The administration's latest available figures show the 
country's advertising sales were 13.4 billion yuan ($1.54 
billion) last year, which was up at least 50 per cent from the 
previous year. 
  Zheng predicted nationwide advertising business growth of 
between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in 1994. 
  Estimates of growth this year probably would be even higher 
had there not been substantial advertising price increases at 
the beginning of this year, he added. 
  The government has launched a trial programme in Guangdong 
Province to prohibit the province's media units from seeking or 
meeting clients for advertising business without going through 
designated advertising companies. 
  He expects similar moves will be carried out nationwide by 
the turn of this century, he said. 
  Official figures show that, by the end of last year, the 
country had already set up some 10,000 advertising agencies, up 
149 per cent from the previous year. 
  At the same time, the government has come to realize the 
need 
to rein force the management of the advertising market. 
  It is still in its infancy, and while the State oversees 
specific, designated advertising agencies, anyone could still 
set themselves up to sell space or air time around the country.

<F P=106> [By Zheng Caixiong: "Guangdong Needs Investment Worth $190b </F>
in Next 20 Years"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou--Guangdong estimates that it needs to 
attract more than $190 billion in foreign investment to help 
realize its ambitious modernization plan within 20 years. 
  To achieve this goal, the South China province will open all 
sectors to foreign investment, apart from special industries 
which still fall under central control, said Lu Ruihua, managing 
vice-governor in an interview with Business Weekly last week. 
  In addition to improving the infrastructure, Guangdong 
expects to set up a concrete market framework and introduce an 
economic development system in line with international practice. 
Lu said he hopes this will create a better investment climate. 
  "We are offering the markets, the stocks, the interest and 
the efficiency to overseas investors to let them earn big money 
in the province," Lu said. 
  Foreign investment will be used to develop infrastructure 
industries like energy, transport and telecommunications, 
ethylene, automobiles, electronics, textiles and medicine. 
  Meanwhile, Guangdong is steering foreign investment toward 
new and high-tech industries as well as high-value-added sectors 
and export-oriented agriculture. 
  But rural areas still hope foreign investment will arrive to 
develop labour-intensive processing industries. 
  Guangdong also hopes to receive more loans from foreign 
financial groups to invest in the province. 
  The province also needs to set up more service centers to 
better support investors. 
  To woo foreign businessmen, Guangdong is organizing a 
foreign 
trade and investment fair in Hong Kong from June 28 to July 2 
and a similar fair in the United States in mid-November. 
  Foreign capital is expected to play an important role in 
future economic growth, Lu said. 
  In the first five months this year Guangdong attracted $4.09 
billion in foreign investment up 37.6 per cent over the same 
period last year. Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, Huizhou Zhanjiang, 
Shantou and Jieyang reported foreign investment increases of 
more than 50 per cent. 
  Despite a 10 per cent drop of investment from Hong Kong, 
funds from the United States, Britain France, Thailand and 
Australia soared by more than 50 per cent during the January-May 
period. 
  In the period from 1979 to 1993, Guangdong attracted foreign 
investment commitments of $84.9 billion and actual overseas 
investment of $29.45 billion. Both numbers account for over 30 
per cent of the national total in those categories. And by 
1993, Guangdong had registered over 41,000 foreign-funded firms.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Inequality </F>
Behind the Slogan of `Equality'"] 
  [Text] The affairs in the world today can be characterized 
by "the tree desiring stillness but the wind not ceasing." When 
the clamor of "linking trade with human rights" has just 
subsided, certain Western nations are again trying to peddle 
their "linkage between trade and laborers' rights and interests" 
in a bid to force it into the GATT document. This will 
naturally meet objection from the vast number of developing 
nations. 
  In light of this fallacy, trade expanded by the developing 
nations with their cheap labor prices is "immoral," "unfair," 
and "unequal" to the laborers of the developed or developing 
nations; international trade organs should set up a standard for 
labor prices and consider it a condition for developing nations 
to enter the international market. In other words, Western 
nations can erect trade obstacles under the excuse of the poor 
remuneration of the laborers in some countries. 
  People may feel it strange that the gentlemen of the rich 
nations have suddenly shown concern for the interests of the 
laborers in the poor nations. People with good sense know that 
this is another trick played by some Western nations to make up 
for the decline in their economic competitiveness. In the name 
of showing concern for the interests of laborers of the 
developing nations, they are actually practicing trade 
protectionism. 
  As everyone knows, for various reasons, the wages of 
laborers 
of the developing nations have always been lower than those of 
the developed nations. It will be impossible to compare the per 
capita wage of several hundred dollars of a poor nation with 
that of $20,000 of a rich nation. This is common sense. It is 
the right of the developing nations to take advantage of their 
cheap labor to increase exports and take part in international 
competition, which brooks no outside interference. To increase 
remuneration of their laborers, the developing nations must 
expand trade, develop their economies, and increase incomes of 
their people. It would be unrealistic to raise the wages of the 
developing nations to a level forced by the Western nations, 
irrespective of their own national conditions. Moreover, it 
will also weaken one of the limited advantages of the developing 
nations, benefit the rich nations, let the poor nations suffer, 
and eventually harm the interests of the laborers of the 
developing nations. 
  Thus it can be seen that those who have proposed "linking 
trade with the rights and interests of laborers" are not really 
concerned about the well-being of the laborers. Instead, they 
want to take this as an excuse to deprive the poor nations of 
the opportunity to strive for development with their advantage 
of cheap labor. Such a practice of ignoring the national 
conditions of the developing nations and forcing the poor 
nations to compete with the rich ones on the same level is 
tantamount to a fight between a light weight boxer and a heavy 
one, which is even more "immoral," "unfair," and "unequal." 
  Trade protectionism is a behavior which lacks foresight. 
This is particularly true in the trade protectionism practiced 
by the developed nations to the developing ones. It should be 
noted that trade and economic growth of the developing nations 
has precisely offered an extensive market and investment place 
for the developed nations. The situation in East Asia today 
serves as a practical example. The problem is, on the one hand, 
some Western nations want to make the most of the opportunity to 
strengthen economic cooperation with the developing nations; on 
the other hand, they are also afraid that the developing nations 
will become powerful, which in turn will menace their own 
interests. Hence, they adopt all kinds of measures to restrict 
the growth of the developing nations. Such a self-contradictory 
move will only intensify the confrontation between the north and 
south, harm the interests of developing nations, and eventually 
ruin their own interests. 
  Although the situation after the end of the Cold War has 
proved that naked military intervention will not work, economic 
intervention is now on the rise. "The linkage between trade and 
laborers' rights and interests" is a reproduction by the 
hegemonists in the economic field. This merits vigilance.

  [Text] Wuhan, China, June 24 (AFP)--PSA Peugeot Citroen 
hopes to produce 350,000 cars per year in China by 2000, about 
one-fourth of local production, after signing joint-venture 
pacts with Chinese state enterprises. The group could 
potentially increase the production level to 500,000 within a 
few years if China's market for private cars is developed. 
Currently, China only makes cars for taxi and government use. 
  PSA Peugeot Citroen joint ventures signed or under 
negotiation could represent more than a third of the current 
long-term production potential in China in association with all 
foreign makers. 
  VAG (Volkswagen-Audi) is second behind PSA Peugeot Citroen 
in 
terms of expected production capacity with 450,000 units, 
followed by U.S. company Chrysler with 200,000, Korea's Daewoo 
with 150,000, and Japan's Daihatsu at 100,000. 
  Peugeot, the second European auto maker to come to China, 
arrived in 1985 just after Volkswagen and is today expanding its 
base in Guangzhou, with the help of the city council. Guangzhou 
owns 46 percent of the joint venture Guangzhou Peugeot 
Automobile. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which owns a 22 percent stake 
in Guangzhou Peugeot, is in the process of completing phase two 
of its industrial set up, intended to bring production capacity 
of its 505 series to 50,000 a year. It has also negotiated the 
construction of a new factory with an annual capacity of 150,000 
model 405 cars. 
  Construction of the 120 hectare factory requires an 
investment of 600 million dollars and completion of the project 
before the century's end in order for Peugeot to expand along 
with the expected growth in the car market here. In several 
years, the domestic car market is forecast to triple from the 
current level of 550,000 cars, of which 225,000 are made locally. 
  In Wuhan, 800 kilometers north of Guangzhou, Citroen is 
building two ultra-modern European-size factories which will 
employ 11,000 people. The factories are scheduled to go into 
operation in 1996 and are expected to produce 150,000 ZX cars 
for a total investment of five billion French francs ($910 
million). 
  The first factory in Wuhan will be devoted to assembling 
vehicles. The second, built in Xiangfan, 350 kilometers (217 
miles) to the west, will make motors, gearboxes amd suspension 
systems. 
  Citroen's double chevron logo will be associated with 
Dongfeng Motor Corporation, a former truck maker, which owns 70 
percent of the joint venture. Citroen holds 25 percent of the 
company, Societe General possesses four percent, and Banque 
Nationale de Paris has one percent. 
  The annual capacity of the two sites is expected to be 
300,000 vehicles. The joint venture is expected to introduce the 
smaller AX car, intended for private customers, a market which 
barely exists at the moment. Despite a population of 1.2 
billion, China in 1993 estimated that only 50,000 cars belonged 
to private individuals. 
  Citroen and Peugeot differ from Japanese makers, who are 
barely present in the Chinese automobile industry, in that they 
agreed to major transfers of technology in order to get the 
contracts. The pair also expect a major local integration rate 
of about 60 percent, which will be closer to 100 percent near 
2003 or 2004. The two companies say they would like to have 
separate distribution networks, which are only now beginning to 
develop.

<F P=106> [By reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- The protection of 
intellectual property rights in China, a country rapidly 
advancing with its endeavors toward reform and opening up, is an 
issue of close attention not only at home but also in the rest 
of world. During an interview with this reporter, Shen Rengan 
[3088 0088 1626], deputy director of the State Copyright Bureau, 
said that while everyone can see the remarkable successes the 
Chinese Government and relevant departments have achieved in 
protecting copyrights, certain people abroad have disregarded 
these facts and accused the Chinese Government of being not 
earnest in protecting intellectual property rights. They have 
also tried to use this as an excuse for exercising economic 
pressure on China. Their accusation is neither objective nor 
just. 
  Shen Rengan said: China was indeed quite late in introducing 
copyright protection, but the development has been 
extraordinarily fast. After the "PRC Copyright Law" went into 
effect in 1991, China has also promulgated many other supporting 
regulations, such as the administrative regulations governing 
copyright management. With the enactment of these laws and 
regulations, China's copyright protection has been codified into 
law. Meanwhile, China also joined, in October 1992 and April 
1993 respectively, the "Berne Convention," and the "World 
Copyright Convention" and the "Convention for Recorded 
Products." It also established ties with more than 100 
countries on protecting each other's copyrights. Since then, 
copyright protection at home has been associated with 
international copyright protection. These developments, 
achieved in just a few years, are unprecedented in the world. 
  Shen Rengan continued: According to law, all Chinese 
citizens, legal entities, and organizations can request that the 
people's court protect their copyrights when they have been 
violated, and their copyrights will be effectively protected by 
law. Meanwhile, to conform to China's situation, we also have 
established channels for administrative protection, which, in 
addition to serving authors and copyright owners, can alleviate 
the pressure on courts and make copyright protection and 
punishment of copyright infringements more efficient. On the 
other hand, the establishment and development of copyright agent 
services and organs to manage copyrights collectively also have 
positive effects in protecting the legitimate rights and 
interests of copyright owners and disseminators of creative 
works and in promoting copyright trade between China and other 
countries. These achievements show that China not only has 
drawn up a universally acknowledged advanced law for protecting 
copyrights, but has also established a relatively sound system 
for enforcing the law. 
  Of course, China, being a sprawling and populous country, 
must continue to make great efforts over a long period of time 
before the Chinese people are fully aware of copyright 
protection and before the vast number of consumers obey the 
copyright law voluntarily. Shen Rengan frankly admitted that 
China still faces serious problems regarding implementing the 
"Copyright Law" and protecting authors' rights and interests. 
He said: Copyright piracy is now our biggest challenge. He 
said: In their quest of economic interests, certain lawless 
elements have pirated and sold great quantities of books, audio 
and video tapes, laser discs, and computer sofeware. Not only 
have these people infringed upon the economic and spiritual 
[jing shen 4737 4377] rights and interests of creators of 
intellectual property, the interests of cultural and 
scientific-technological industries, and the interests of the 
states, as well as upset the normal market order, but they have 
also affected the development of cultural, scientific, and 
technical exchange and economic relations and trade between 
China and foreign countries and produced effects harmful to 
China's reform and opening up as well as the nation's material 
and spiritual construction. 
  Shen Rengan said: China has been fighting and sanctioning 
against copyright piracy. Incomplete statistics show that, in 
1993, the State Press and Publications Administration 
confiscated three million copies of pirated publications, and 
480,000 boxes of pirated videocassette tapes. This year, to 
deal with rampant problems involving pirated compact discs, the 
administration has conducted inspections in over ten provinces 
and municipalities -- including Guangdong, Shanghai, Fujian and 
Beijing -- and the widespread drive has achieved remarkable 
results in screening and consolidating the markets, 
manufacturers, and vendors of audio and video products. 
  Shen Rengan said: Copyright piracy is not a problem in 
China only, but is also a problem troubling the governments of 
many countries. Such governments have taken all kinds of 
measures to combat this phenomena. The Chinese Government and 
relevant departments are not exceptional in this regard. People 
can see from the great deal of work we have accomplished that 
the Chinese Government is extremely serious in establishing a 
system for protecting intellectual property rights and enforcing 
the copyright law. Unfortunately, certain people abroad have 
disregarded these facts and have complained about certain 
problems which are inevitable during the process of establishing 
and improving the system of protecting intellectual property 
rights. These people have even threatened to conduct so-called 
investigations and exercise pressure through imposing 
"sanctions." Shen Rengan solemnly pointed out that this is not 
a constructive attitude in seeking a solution. 
  Shen Rengan indicated that improving the system of 
protecting 
intellectual property rights has become a basic national policy. 
To make the operations in this area more effective, he said, 
China will amend the "Copyright Law" and the "Regulations for 
Implementing the Copyright Law" and supplement the copyright law 
with provisions on criminal sanctions. The State Council and 
other relevant departments are also taking measures to solve the 
many problems in managing and producing audio and video products 
in an effort to support the fight against piracy. Meanwhile, we 
will direct even more personnel to handle cases of copyright 
piracy and strictly punish the violators so as to safeguard 
copyright owners' rights and interests and the dignity of the 
law. Shen Rengan stressed, in particular, that what they have 
done is primarily for the sake of China's cultural and 
scientific-technological development, because the biggest 
victims of copyright piracy are our own authors, and the 
publishing, audio and video, movie, and software industries. He 
expressed the belief that, following the improvement of China's 
legal system and the development of the economy, China will 
continue to improve in its endeavors toward protecting 
intellectual property rights.

<F P=106> [By Gao Jin'an: "Copyright Gets More Protection"] </F>
  [Text] In a fresh move to further protect the rights and 
interests of overseas copyright owners, China is to implement a 
copyright certification system for audio and video products. 
  Under the system, foreign agencies will be asked to provide 
copyright certificates for audio and video products which are to 
be distributed and shown in China. 
  Wang Huapeng, director of the Copyright Department under the 
National Copyright Administration (NCA), said that the new 
system will help to protect overseas copyright owners while 
checking piracy. 
  The Motion Picture Industiy Association (MPIA) of Hong Kong 
became the first agency to be entrusted to provide copyright 
certificates for Hong Kong videos and laser discs which are to 
be introduced into the mainland market. 
  A memorandum on copyright certification between the NCA and 
MPIA of Hong Kong was signed yesterday in Beijing, marking the 
first step for the implementation of the certification system. 
  Gao Linghan, a senior official from the NCA, disclosed that 
the administration is now contacting and negotiating with the 
London-based International Federation of the Phonograph Industry 
and two American associations for copyright certification. 
  After the signing ceremony, Crucindo Hung, chairman of the 
MPIA, said that member companies of his association produce over 
90 per cent of home videos in Hong Kong each year, and a large 
number of them are likely to be popular on the mainland. 
  Hung hopes that his association's co-operation with the NCA 
will be further expanded. 
  The MPLA was founded in 1986 and it now has 150 member 
companies in the territory. 
  In the past years, Chinese audio and video companies have 
found it difficult to identify the copyright owners of overseas 
products. Some foreign crooks took the opportunity to cheat 
Chinese companies, thus putting them at risk of copyright 
infringement. 
  China implemented its Copyright Law in 1991, placing all 
copyrights under legal protection. 
  The country joined the World Intellectual Property 
Organization in 1980 and became a signatory of three more 
conventions in 1993, namely the Berne Convention for the 
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Universal 
Copyright Convention and the Convention for the Protection of 
Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized Duplication of 
Their Phonograms in 1993.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Xiaoling (1203 1420 3781)] </F>
  [Text] Since the promulgation of the "Copyright Law" three 
years ago, Shanghai has achieved gratifying results in 
foreign-related copyright business and cooperative publication. 
According to incomplete statistics, Shanghai's 25 publishing 
houses have established business relations with nearly 100 
publishing organizations in 13 foreign countries including 
Japan, the United States, and Britain as well as in the Hong 
Kong and Taiwan regions in the 1991-1993 period. During these 
three years, nearly 300 agreements for copyright business and 
cooperative publication were signed, involving 375 books. 
Starting from 1993, a new trend appeared in foreign-related 
copyright business -- the number of purchased foreign copyrights 
increased. Last year alone, some publishing houses in Shanghai 
signed 67 agreements for purchasing foreign copyrights involving 
67 books. Most of the foreign companies owning these copyrights 
are located in the United States. 
  While carrying out the "Copyright Law," these publishing 
houses have encountered many difficulties. The most outstanding 
problem was that, after spending a lot of money for the rights 
to reproduce books or audio-video products in China, they found 
out local publishing houses had already pirated a large amount 
of these books or audio-video products, even before the 
copyrighted ones were printed or put on the market. This 
practice not only infringed on the economic benefits of the 
copyright owners but also severely dampened their enthusiasm to 
be involved in copyrights from other countries or regions. 
  Besides, some books published in Shanghai or other places in 
China were often found pirated. For example, "Biography of 
Jiang Qing" authored by Ye Yonglie, "Chinese Historical Stories" 
published by the Shanghai Cultural Publishing House, "Modern 
American Spoken Language" and "Contemporary American Colloquial 
Language" published by the Shanghai Foreign Language Education 
Publishing House, and "Intelligence Training for 365 Nights" 
published by the Children's Publishing House were pirated. 
  Three years have passed since the promulgation of the 
"Copyright Law." Why is piracy still on the rise? First, 
publicity regarding the "Copyright Law" has not been widespread. 
Some publishers who infringed others' copyrights did not know 
that their act was illegal. Second, the punishment for 
copyright violations is too lenient. According to present 
regulations, any person who is convicted of piracy or plagiarism 
shall be fined 10,000-100,000 yuan. This amount is very small 
compared to the high profits available. No wonder there are 
still some lawbreakers willing to take a chance. As a result, 
the act of rights infringement cannot be completely checked. 
Third, some publishing houses disregarded the law and sold 
their authorized books to individual publishers who in turn 
published some hot-selling books under new titles for huge 
profits. 
  In view of this situation, relevant personages of Shanghai's 
publishing circles and copyright department urged society to pay 
attention to the work of giving publicity to and popularizing 
the "Copyright Law," saying it is necessary to adopt more 
effective legal measures to conscientiously protect the legal 
rights and benefits of copyright owners and copyright users. In 
this way, China's copyright work can soon reach international 
standards.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Securities Traders Get Information Yardstick"] </F>
  [Text] Current and prospective players on the securities 
market received a boost yesterday when the China Securities 
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued regulations concerning the 
required formats of interim reports published by listed 
companies. 
  The stipulations aim to present information concerning the 
structure, management and performance of the listed companies in 
a more standardized format. This should allow investors to 
compare listed companies, in terms of an investment risk, more 
readily. 
  Analysts said that the move will also revitalize 
international investors' enthusiasm for buying Chinese shares. 
  Sufficient information will help them better understand 
Chinese firms and make right investment decision. 
  According to the format, the interim report should include a 
financial report, review and forecast of business operation, 
company's major events, changes of the company's stock 
structure, brief introduction of provisional general meeting and 
documents for future reference. 
  The CSRC requires that the board directors of each company 
should guarantee the accuracy, truth and fairness of the reports. 
  The documents should be completed within 60 days after the 
end of the first six months of the fiscal year. 
  The listed companies should submit 10 copies of their 
reports 
to the CSRC and stock exchanges for record purposes. 
  These reports will be issued in at least one of the eight 
domestic newspapers and magazines which are authorized by CSRC 
to issue securities information. 
  They include, China Daily, Financial News, Economic Daily, 
China Securities, Securities Market Weekly, Shanghai Securities 
News, Securities Times and China Reform Newspaper. 
  Chinese companies, which list their shares on both domestic 
and overseas exchanges, should issue their interim reports at 
the same time to domestic and overseas investors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the </F>
People's Bank of China, by staff reporters Li Zhengping (2621 
3630 1627) and Wang Zhi (3769 2535); place and date not given: 
"The Financial Situation Is Developing in a Stable and Healthy 
Manner; the Reform of the Financial Structure Is Progressing 
Smoothly"] 
  [Text] In June last year, the CPC Central committee and the 
State Council put forward in good time a series of measures to 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, 
which rapidly changed the situation and maintained the good 
momentum of the healthy economic development. Since the 
beginning of this year, the financial system has resolutely 
implemented the principle for the financial work of "continuing 
the consolidation of the financial order, steadily pushing 
forward the financial reform, strictly controlling the total 
volume of credit, and earnestly strengthening supervision over 
finances" put forward by the State Council. How has the 
financial situation been over the past few months? What 
progress has been made in financial structure reform? A few 
days ago, our staff reporters interviewed Zhou Zhengqing, vice 
president of the People's Bank of China, on these issues. 
  [Reporter] People from all circles of society are very 
concerned about financial operations. Will you please give us 
an account of the current financial situation? 
  [Zhou] On the whole, the current economic and financial 
situation is continuing to develop in a favorable direction, and 
the financial situation is stable and healthy. This is 
manifested in the following aspects: First, currency continues 
to be withdrawn from circulation. From January to April, a net 
total of 5.07 billion yuan of cash was withdrawn, while a net 
total of over 30 billion yuan was put into circulation in the 
same period last year. The withdrawal of currency from 
circulation was mainly attributed to the increase in bank 
savings and the good situation in the sale of state treasury 
bonds. Second, bank deposits have increased by a relatively 
large margin. In the first four months, various kinds of bank 
deposits at state banks increased by more than 260 billion yuan, 
over 110 billion yuan more than the same period last year, of 
which deposits of enterprises increased by 100 billion yuan. 
The payment ability of enterprises has further increased, and 
their funding difficulties have been eased further. Third, 
loans granted by state banks have greatly increased. This has 
effectively met the funding needs for industrial production 
enterprises and key state construction projects. From January 
to April, the amount of loans granted by state banks increased 
by more than 75 billion yuan, 20 billion yuan over the same 
period last year, of which loans to provide working funds for 
industry increased by nearly 10 billion yuan. According to 
statistics from the People's Construction Bank of China, by the 
end of April, loans for key state construction projects 
accounted for 63.4 percent of the total in plans for loans 
already issued. Funds for key construction projects were 
delivered in good time. Fourth, the payment ability of state 
banks has increased. Fifth, the sales of state treasury bonds 
have progressed smoothly. By 28 May, 64.8 billion yuan of state 
treasury bonds had been sold (of which three-year bonds 
accounted for 41.8 billion yuan and two-year bonds accounted for 
23 billion yuan). Some provinces have fulfilled the sales plans 
assigned them. Sixth, the reform of the foreign exchange 
structure has been carried out smoothly. The exchange rate of 
the renminbi has basically been stable at a ratio of about $1 to 
8.6 yuan. The operation of foreign exchange business among 
banks is normal, and the state's foreign exchange reserve has 
increased considerably. 
  [Reporter] In the beginning of this year, the reform of the 
economic structure in our country had already gotten started in 
the areas of finance, banking, foreign exchange, foreign trade, 
investment, and the enterprise system. Please tell us about the 
progress of financial structure reform. 
  [Zhou] As is known to all, in accordance with the resolution 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
the implementation of the plans for reforming the financial 
structure and for reforming the foreign exchange management 
structure officially began at the beginning of the year. 
Various quarters have reacted favorably to the new measures for 
reforming the financial structure since their implementation. 
To ensure the smooth implementation of measures to reform the 
financial structure, the People's Bank of China has, with the 
approval of the State Council, formulated and promulgated a 
series of new management methods and rules, such as the "Interim 
Methods for the Management of Credit funds," "Interim Monitoring 
and Control Indexes for the Management of Assets and Liabilities 
of Commercial Banks," "Interim Rules on the Capital and Assets 
Insurance Weight of Commercial Bank," "Interim Rules on 
Settlement, Sales, and Payment of Foreign Exchange," and so on. 
The State Development Bank and the China Import and Export Bank 
have officially been organized and established, and preparations 
for the establishment of the China Agricultural Development Bank 
are in full swing. This is one step toward separating financial 
business of a policy nature from that of a commercial nature and 
is of great importance to guiding the orientation of the input 
of society's funds, to implementing the state industrial policy, 
and to the rational distribution of economic resources. 
Besides, to improve macroeconomic financial regulation and 
control, we have set up a central bank open market trading 
office in Shanghai, and, in order to coordinate with the reform 
of the foreign exchange structure, we have set up the China 
foreign exchange trading center. At present, various branches 
of the People's Bank of China are, in accordance with the 
arrangements of the headquarters of the bank, further 
strengthening their functions and roles in "financial 
supervision and management, investigation, statistics, and 
analysis, horizontal money supply regulation, management of 
state treasury, procurement and allocation of funds, foreign 
exchange management, and settlement among banks," and are 
shifting their emphasis from the division of funds and the 
division of scale to doing a good job in macroeconomic 
regulation and control, strengthening financial supervision and 
management, and conducting investigation and study. On the 
whole, various financial reform measures are being energetically 
and steadily implemented. 
  In the course of steadily pushing forward financial 
reform, we have attached great importance to drawing from the 
experience and lessons of similar efforts in the past. While 
making clear and adhering to the orientation of market reform, 
we have put special emphasis on always proceeding from reality, 
paying attention to coordinating financial reform with the 
progress of reform in other aspects, and adopting steady 
progress as the reform strategy. Practice over the past few 
months has proved that we are on the right track. The smooth 
progress of reform in various aspects has also confirmed this. 
  [Reporter] The summer harvest has begun. What policies and 
measures have the banks adopted to ensure sufficient funds for 
the procurement of agricultural and sideline products this 
summer? 
  [Zhou] In recent years, the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council have repeatedly stressed that banks should ensure 
the supply of funds for the procurement of grain, cotton, edible 
oils, and other agricultural and sideline products and that 
"IOU" notes should never be given to peasants. To ensure that 
sufficient funds for procurement will be available at the right 
time this year, the People's Bank of China, along with various 
special banks, has energetically organized investigation and 
study in April and has made concrete arrangements for the supply 
and management of funds for the procurement of agricultural and 
sideline products this summer. We have primarily adopted the 
following measures: 1) Continue to implement the responsibility 
system of raising funds for the procurement of agricultural and 
sideline products through various channels under the unified 
leadership of governments at various levels. Various banks are 
being asked to cooperate closely with local financial 
departments, procurement enterprises, and other departments 
concerned to seriously ensure that various kinds of funds are 
available. 2) Continue to implement methods for the management 
of special accounts of funds for the procurement and sale of 
major agricultural and sideline products. Loans earmarked for 
procurement can only be used for procurement, and 
misappropriation of such loans is prohibited. In view of the 
establishment of the branches of the Agricultural Development 
Bank this year and in order to avoid affecting the summer 
harvest, we have made concrete arrangements in the division of 
work and responsibility. The general principle is that 
institutional reform should never be allowed to affect the 
supply of funds for the procurement of agricultural and sideline 
products. 3) Energetically give play to the supervisory role of 
banks. The departments concerned should be urged to have funds 
for procurement available at the right time. Regarding 
procurement enterprises which have misappropriated procurement 
loans, banks should withdraw the loans and should ask them to 
pay, as a fine, interest for the loans misappropriated. 4) 
Demand that all banks at various levels adopt effective measures 
to strengthen the procurement, allocation, and regulation of 
funds to ensure the supply of funds for procurement and try 
every possible means to overcome difficulty of funds in the 
course of procuring agricultural and sideline products. 
  [Reporter] At present, some state enterprises have 
encountered some difficulties. How do you look at this issue? 
What policies and measures will the banks adopt toward it? 
  [Zhou] We have organized various banks to coordinate with 
the departments concerned to conduct an investigation into the 
current difficulties of state enterprises. Viewed from the 
situation reflected in the investigation, the number of state 
enterprises that have stopped production or are running at 
half-capacity is still small, and they are mainly small and 
medium enterprises. However, from January to April, the profits 
of state enterprises increased instead of decreasing, and their 
losses decreased instead of increasing. The growth rate of 
production in state industrial enterprises rose from 2.2 percent 
in the first quarter to 5 percent in April. The causes of 
difficulties encountered by some state enterprises are many. 
For example: the excessive growth of investment in fixed 
assets, the failure to raise funds, and the misappropriation of 
working funds; the serious phenomenon of delay in the payment of 
debts among enterprises; and the excessive production capacity 
of some trades, the improper internal management of enterprises, 
the products that could not be sold, and the increase in idle 
funds used to stockpile products. These problems cannot be 
solved merely by increasing the money supply or increasing loans 
from the banks. To fundamentally solve the problems, 
enterprises can only take the road of "deepening reform, 
transforming mechanisms, making efforts to improve internal 
management, and increasing economic results." 
  On the whole, the national economy is still growing at a 
relatively high speed, and the economy and finances are 
developing in a favorable direction. However, the pressure of 
inflation has not yet been fundamentally eliminated. Therefore, 
the financial departments should continue to implement the 
principle of exercising strict control over the total credit 
volume formulated by the State Council, and in particular, over 
loans for fixed assets. They should never increase the scale of 
loans fixed by the state. They should continue to consolidate 
the financial order, should resolutely stop arbitrary 
fund-raising activities, borrowing money, increasing interest, 
or setting up financial organs, and should put a halt to 
operations that go beyond their business scope. They should 
earnestly strengthen financial supervision and management. In 
the second half of this year, they also should make special 
arrangements for consolidating the settlement order, strictly 
enforce discipline in settlement, and solve problems of putting 
bills and notes aside and misappropriating or retaining 
customers' funds. 
  Regarding the current difficulties of some state 
enterprises, 
banks have adopted some policies and measures in accordance with 
the arrangements made by the State Council: Loans should be 
granted in good time to all state enterprises whose products can 
actually be sold and which can produce good economic results, 
and banks should energetically support and help money-losing 
enterprises which have reduced their losses or have started 
making profits. For those state enterprises that have stopped 
production and are having difficulty paying wages to their 
workers and staff members, banks should coordinate with the 
local governments and grant some loans to solve their actual 
difficulty on the condition of giving play to the role of the 
social security system. Besides, local governments or 
departments in charge of these enterprises should pay the 
appropriate interest and help such enterprises resume production 
and overcome their difficulties. Regrading enterprises which 
have no hope to stop losing money and whose assets cannot be 
used for a mortgage, preparation should be earnestly carried out 
for declaring them bankrupt according to law by stages and in 
groups. Experiments should first be carried out before this 
practice is made widespread. 
  The tasks of macroeconomic financial regulation and control 
are still heavy. To do a good job in financial work, we have 
demanded that leaders at all levels of the financial system go 
deep into the grass-roots units, pay close attention to changes 
in the local economy and finance, report on the situation in 
good time, and put forward methods and suggestions for 
strengthening and improving macroeconomic financial regulation 
and control. I believe that, under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council and with the concerted 
efforts of the entire financial system, the tasks in the 
financial work for the whole year will certainly be successfully 
fulfilled.

<F P=106> [Special article by reporter Hung Wen (3126 2429)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
detailed regulation for China's land gain tax, which has 
attracted the attention of foreign investors, is expected to be 
officially promulgated this summer. To adapt themselves to this 
new change, all localities have taken positive measures, based 
on ensuring the implementation of the new regulations, and tried 
to mitigate the impact on developers through screening the 
imposition of irrational real estate taxes and applying to the 
central authorities for exemption of certain special projects. 
They have continued to step up measures to attract foreign 
investment in real estate. 
  According to analyses by economic experts, as the central 
government is determined to levy land gain taxes and the 
provisional regulations promulgated earlier in the year will be 
considered new regulations, there should be no doubt as to the 
seriousness of this basic principle. For this reason, it is 
imperative that the regulations be put into effect this year. 
As for detailed issues that do not involve the principle, 
consideration will be given -- to the extent possible -- to the 
views and proposals of foreign investors so that the problem can 
be handled flexibly. 
  As for local governments, on the one hand, they gradually 
have come to realize the authority of the new regulations. They 
know that legislation and explanation of the land gain tax lies 
with the central government. Hence, it is unlikely there will 
be any change without authorization. On the other hand, all 
localities had to face squarely the problem of the slow-down in 
real estate investment by foreign firms, which were taking a 
look-and-see attitude toward the new regulations, and make 
limited adaptions in taxation. 
  Indications over the past few months show that while getting 
ready to implement the detailed regulations for land gain taxes, 
all localities have planned countermeasures and adopted rational 
moves to ensure the enthusiasm of foreign investors. The 
general practice is: Abolishing or merging the irrational 
portion of the local taxes previously levied on real estate 
developers in a bid to alleviate their burden. In addition, the 
domestic housing projects built on land obtained through 
auction, as well as projects encouraged by the central 
government, should be exempted from taxes if the return is under 
20 percent. 
  Take Fujian, for example: Real estate developers had to pay 
more than 50 kinds of taxes, which now have been reduced to some 
30 after screening. Fuzhou abolished six kinds of taxes in 
April and lowered the rates of eight kinds of taxes, which 
relevantly lowered the investment cost of real estate developers 
by around 5 percent. Other cities like Jinan, Zhuhai, and 
Shanghai recently promulgated new measures to attract foreign 
capital and encourage foreign investors to increase their 
investment. 
  As for the real estate developers, experts say that 
readjustment is necessary to adapt to the changes, but 
over-nervousness is unnecessary, as it may result in loss of new 
investment opportunities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Liu Chengguo, vice minister of agriculture, </F>
by staff reporter Liu Xianghong (0491 0686 4767); place and date 
not given: "Rural Economic Development Is Encouraging, Greater 
Efforts Have Yet To Be Made To Ensure Increase in Output and 
Revenue--Interview With Liu Chengguo, Vice Minister of 
Agriculture"] 
  [Text] [Liu Xianghong] Better harvests have been reaped in 
China for several years in succession, and the total grain 
output last year hit an all-time high once again. Judging from 
the present circumstances, what is the situation of grain, 
edible oil, and cotton production and the "shopping basket" 
project in China this year? 
  [Liu Chengguo] The party Central Committee and State Council 
successively convened two rural work meetings in October last 
year and March this year. These meetings repeatedly stressed 
the predominant position of agriculture and rural work in 
economic development and social stability and promulgated a 
series of policies. As a functional department under the State 
Council in charge of the rural economy and the comprehensive 
management of such industries as crop cultivation, animal 
husbandry, fishing, agriculture, township and town enterprises, 
farm machinery, feed-processing, the Ministry of Agriculture has 
made positive efforts to implement the guidelines of the above 
central rural work meetings. As viewed from the conditions in 
various sectors, the current operation of agriculture and the 
rural economy is basically normal. Serious attention has been 
paid to grain production, quantities of "shopping basket" 
products and township and town enterprises grew relatively 
rapidly, and the peasants' cash income increased more rapidly 
than last year. The grain acreage this summer will be 465 
million mu, decreasing by 7 million mu as compared with last 
year. It is anticipated that total grain output will exceed 210 
billion jin and the sown area of grain in the whole year will be 
approximately 1.646 billion mu, decreasing slightly in terms of 
output and by approximately 12 million mu in terms of area as 
compared with last year. Summing up pertinent analyses and 
predictions, we expect that, barring abnormal weather in the 
latter half of this year, the total grain output will be close 
to that of 1993, a year of an extraordinary bumper harvest. The 
sown area of oil-bearing crops has increased so that output for 
the entire year will hopefully be larger than last year. Since 
the procurement price of cotton was raised, the enthusiasm for 
growing cotton has been rekindled to some extent in the cotton 
growing areas, and the sown area will reach approximately 80 
million mu, higher than last year. The production situation is 
still grim, however, as there is a considerable gap with the 
state's plans and arrangements. The "shopping basket" project 
has enabled the production of non-staple food to maintain a 
rising momentum. Except for some areas where pork is in short 
supply, there will be a relatively adequate supply of other 
products in the markets. Township and town enterprises 
continued to maintain comparatively rapid growth, and the per 
capita cash income of peasants across the country increased more 
rapidly in the first quarter than in the same period this year. 
  [Liu Xianghong] In light of the inadequate acreage of spring 
sowing and other problems, what measures has the Ministry of 
Agriculture taken to strive for bumper harvests in grain and 
cotton? 
  [Liu] In order to stabilize grain production and change the 
situation of reduced cotton output for two consecutive years, we 
have paid special attention to the following issues. 
  First, we gave guidance and encouragement to the localities, 
where conditions exist, to increase the acreage of the "two 
improved varieties through hybridization," put an emphasis on 
disseminating high-yield and fine-quality hybrid rice 
combination in the Chang Jiang basin and southern China, and 
popularized the method of crossbreeding maize on a tight 
schedule in the Huang He, Huai He, and Hai He basins as well as 
in northeastern China. We also guided the peasants in cotton 
producing regions in northern China, the provinces of Hebei, 
Shandong, and Henan in particular, in giving priority to growing 
cotton on fallow land and reserved ridges in the fields. In the 
localities where conditions exist, the acreage of summer cotton 
should be increased appropriately, and in the cotton producing 
regions in the south, the acreage for transplanting young cotton 
plants in the fields, where wheat or oil-bearing crops have just 
been gathered in, should also be increased wherever conditions 
exist. The autumn grain should be grown sufficiently, and the 
multiple crop index should be heightened. 
  Second, we positively carried out plans for summer harvests 
and paid attention to applying practical key techniques for 
increasing output such as cultivation by using plastic covers, 
deep spread of chemical fertilizers, application of mixed 
manure, and modelled cultivation technique; vigorously enlisted 
people to store farmyard manure and popularized the practices of 
composting the fields with straw and farm manure; pushed forward 
the combination of agriculture with science and education, and 
put in time and energy to enhance the per unit yield of 
agricultural and sideline products. 
  Third, we coordinated with relevant departments in effecting 
proper supply of agricultural production means to ensure the 
demands of agricultural production, intensified supervision and 
control over the markets of means of agricultural production, 
and resolutely cracked down on the production and marketing of 
forged and inferior products. 
  Fourth, we positively led various localities in enhancing 
field management, paid serious attention to preventing and 
curing plant diseases and preventing and eliminating insect 
pests, took firm control of the production of summer grain and 
edible oil, and did a good job of preventing and eradicating 
bollworms. 
  [Liu Xianghong] How will you effectively increase the 
peasants' income while ensuring the market supply of 
agricultural products? 
  [Liu Chengguo] Peasants' cash income in the first quarter 
grew faster than it did last year. Taken as whole, however, the 
task of achieving the objective of increasing the peasants' 
income is still rather difficult. The fundamental way out for 
increasing the peasants' income lies in deepening reform and 
accelerating development. First, on the basis of stabilizing 
grain and cotton acreage, we should make efforts to enhance the 
yield per unit area and reduce production costs. Second, we 
should properly readjust the industrial structure and the 
product mix and energetically develop agriculture characterized 
by high yields, good quality, and high efficiency to enhance 
agricultural economic results. Third, based on the entire land 
resources, we should step up comprehensive agricultural 
development, elevate the production level of medium- and 
low-yield land, and exploit reserve resources. Fourth, we 
should vigorously develop township and town enterprises, combine 
their development with that of small towns, and expedite the 
transfer of surplus laborers in rural areas. In the meantime, 
we should provide guidance to township and town enterprises 
according to different circumstances: Township and town 
enterprises in eastern China should be transformed to the type 
that produces economic results through exports; their work 
should be focused on readjusting the industrial structure and 
the product mix; and efforts should be concentrated on raising 
their operational level and increasing economic results. 
Particular assistance should be given to the development of 
township and town enterprises in central and western China. The 
"demonstration project of cooperation among township and town 
enterprises in eastern and western China" should be well 
organized and put into practice, and special loans to foster 
these enterprises should be made available and regulated 
appropriately. In addition, we should also hold fast to the 
work of reducing the peasants' burdens and coordinate with the 
relevant departments in implementing the "state plan of 
assisting the poor and assaulting fortified positions to resolve 
the food and clothing problems of 80 million rural residents in 
seven years" in order to effectively perform the work of 
assisting the poor through development. 
  [Liu Xianghong] In fact, rural economic development as a 
whole depends on in-depth rural reform. What are the focal 
points of rural reform this year? 
  [Liu Chengguo] Rural reform will be deepened in line with 
the objective of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. This year, we will pay particular attention to the 
following aspects: 
  1. Further efforts should be made to improve the policy of 
grain purchases and sales. In light of the present condition of 
grain demand and supply, reform will focus on intensifying state 
macroeconomic regulation and control of grain. First, on the 
basis of increasing the procurement price of grain, we will 
further improve the procurement method so as to ensure that the 
state controls the necessary sources of grain supply. Second, 
we will set up a venture fund for grain, perfect the system of 
grain reserves, and form a flexible regulatory mechanism to 
stabilize markets and keep down grain prices. Moreover, we will 
tighten the management of grain markets, control wholesale 
exchanges and free retail sales in a proper way, and, at the 
same time, thoroughly separate the commercial operation of grain 
from operation out of policy considerations in business as well 
as in organization. 
  2. On the issue of perfecting the basic rural operating 
system, attention will be focused on implementing policies such 
as extending the time limit for contracted land, compensatory 
transfer of land use rights, and so on. At present, special 
attention should be paid to the following two problems: One is 
making excuses to tear up or change contracts that have not 
expired yet, and the other is raising charges on contracts at 
will. 
  3. We will conscientiously experiment with the joint-stock 
system in rural areas. The joint-stock system cannot be taken 
purely as a means of raising funds, and attention should be paid 
to clarifying the relations between ownership and management, 
transforming operational mechanisms, and forming an effective 
system of asset accumulation. 
  4. We will repeatedly augment the collective economic 
strength, increase the service functions of unified operations, 
and resolve the problem of serving the production and operation 
of peasant households. 
  5. We will construct wholesale "shopping basket" markets, 
positively cultivate the rural market system, define a number of 
projects integrating trade with industry and agriculture, and 
give impetus to developing integrated trade, industrial, and 
agricultural operations.

  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
has decided to arrange record-breaking preferential loans -- 6.5 
billion yuan in all -- to 523 big grain producing and 150 big 
cotton producing counties annually for five years, starting this 
year. 
  Liang Tiangeng, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
said that the counties, selected by the central government from 
among over 2,000 counties across the country, are in 29 
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. 
  "Such an amount of loans for agriculture is really 
unprecedented," Liang said in an interview with XINHUA. 
  The move was designed as part of the efforts to boost the 
country's grain and cotton production. The selection was made 
mainly according to the total annual output of their grain and 
cotton, the official said. 
  The annual loan for the 523 counties totals five billion 
yuan 
(574 million U.S. dollars), while the 150 cotton producing 
counties will be given 1.5 billion yuan (nearly 200 million U.S. 
dollars) of loans each year. 
  The annual interest rate for the loans will be eight 
percent, 
a discount of about two percent, he said. 
  The actual loans for each of the 673 counties will be linked 
to the amount of grain and cotton they produce and sell to the 
state. 
  The provinces, cities and counties involved are themselves 
required to finance 20-30 percent of the total investment needed 
for the programs. 
  The official said that the 673 counties are also required to 
ensure a stable increase in grain and cotton output and sell the 
amount of grain and cotton set by the governments. 
  The 673 counties are encouraged by the central government to 
develop a diversified rural economy, including production of 
high-yielding and profitable farm produce, livestock and aquatic 
products, after they have produced the set amount of grain and 
cotton. 
  East China's Jiangsu Province holds 60 of the 673 counties, 
followed by the country's other leading grain and cotton 
producers -- the Provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, 
Heilongjiang, Sichuan and Hebei. 
  One hundred and twelve of the 150 cotton-producing counties 
are in Shandong, Henan, Hubei or Jiangsu Provinces and Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  In another development, the central government has also 
earmarked one billion yuan (114 million U.S. dollars) for loans 
each year for five years to support the development of 
high-yielding and better farm produce across the country. 
  The central government's aim with those loans is to make 
efficient use of resources and increase farmers' incomes, as 
China is in the process of adopting a socialist market economy 
and the demand for better farm produce is on the increase. 
  The plan is for about 30 demonstration areas for such farm 
produce to be chosen, about one for each of the 30 provinces, 
municipalities or autonomous regions, and several big cities 
such as Chongqing in Sichuan Province and Qingdao in Shandong 
Province. 
  The demonstration areas will be of different types, such as 
export-oriented agriculture areas, hi-tech or ecological ones, 
and will serve as examples for farmers elsewhere. 
  Experts say that the move, together with a package of other 
agriculture-related steps this year by the government, such as 
the raising of grain and cotton prices, will make grain and 
cotton production much more profitable for farmers, particularly 
in the leading grain and cotton producing areas. 
  Analysts believe that all these moves will boost grain and 
cotton production and increase farmers' incomes.

  [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- The harvest of summer 
grain crops is expected to be pretty good this year even though 
the area under cultivation of summer grain crops across the 
country has been reduced to 465 million mu this year, a drop of 
7 million mu when compared with the previous year, according to 
the Ministry of Agriculture. It is, however, difficult to 
realize an overall bumper harvest of crops for the entire year. 
Agricultural production across the country should not be 
treated lightly. 
  There are so many difficulties for the autumn grain 
cultivation judging from the current situation. First, the land 
under cultivation of grains continues to decline which makes it 
difficult a gain of crop harvest. Second, natural disasters are 
rather serious with grave drought in northern part and in some 
areas of southwestern China. Serious impacts are seen on 
cultivation of dry crop of maize and on the planting of summer 
paddy in these areas. South China and the southern part of the 
Yangtze River were hit by rainstorms which have already resulted 
in heavy damage to agricultural production. Third, the planting 
of cotton suffered natural disasters in spite of the fact that 
the area under cultivation of cotton increased to some extent. 
It is rather difficult to realize the planned yield of cotton 
planting. Meanwhile, rising prices for chemical fertilizer and 
pesticide due to short supply this year added more difficulties 
to agricultural production. 
  The ministry appealed to various places to pay much more 
attention to agricultural production for the entire year. The 
sowing for summer grain crops is now underway in southern and 
northern parts and efforts should be painstakingly made in order 
to ensure a yield of crops. Time should not be lost in planting 
summer crops. Cultivated acreage should be expanded and 
multiple cropping should be tried in a bid to increase the crop 
yield. Drought condition as well as floods and waterlogging 
have to be promptly dealt with in order to make crop cultivation 
possible with an eventual aim of having a good harvest of grains 
for the whole year.

  [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- Rain has been scarce in 
most parts of northern China since early June, and drought is 
now growing more serious. The average rainfall in the northern 
area of the Huaihe River is less than 10 millimetres. 
Shangdong, Henan and Inner Mongolia have seen not a single drop 
of rain since then. 
  According to the office of the Flood Prevention and Drought 
Combat Headquarters, due to scarcity of rain and high 
temperature, water contained in soil has evaporated fast. At 
present, drought in Shangdong, the northern part of Huaibei, 
most part of Huabei and Northeast spreads quickly. The size of 
drought-hit area in northern China is estimated to be 230 
million mu of land. Many rivers have dried up, water storage in 
reservoirs has dwindled. This has seriously affected crops and 
summer sowing. More than 12 million people and 12 million 
domestic animals are short of drinking water. [paragraph as 
published] 
  According to the Central Weather Broadcasting Centre, since 
early June there has been consecutive days of high temperature 
in most parts of Huabei, Northeast and Shangdong, the 
temperature is two to three degrees centigrade higher on average 
than in normal years. Temperatures in these areas are usually 
around 30 degrees centigrade, and in certain areas the highest 
reaching 37 degrees. This further worsens the situation of 
drought. However, adequate heat is most helpful to the growth 
of crops in areas where water is plenty. The hot weather is 
also beneficial to the harvest of winter wheat.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- The People's Air 
Force held a gathering today to commemorate the 30th naming 
anniversary of the "heroic battalion" by the National Defense 
Ministry. 
  Inscriptions from Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen 
for the "heroic battalion" were read at the gathering. 
  On behalf of the Central Military Commission and the General 
Staff Department, the General Political Department, and the 
General Logistics Department, Chief of General Staff Zhang 
Wannian warmly congratulated the meeting's opening. Zhou Ziyu, 
deputy director of the General Political Department, presented 
the "heroic battalion" with gifts and a bronze board inscribed 
with "The Powerful Guardians of the Nation's Airspace" on it. 
  The "heroic battalion" is a heroic military unit with a high 
fighting will, tough fighting skills, and a tenacious fighting 
style. [passage omitted] The battalion, after rendering 
meritorious services for the motherland and the people by 
shooting down four enemy U-2 strategic and pilotless 
high-altitude reconnaissance planes, was given the honorary 
title of "heroic battalion" in June 1964 by the National Defense 
Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, Zhang Wannian called on officers and men to 
learn from the "heroic battalion"; from their resoluteness in 
listening to the party, their high sense of political awareness 
and strict organizational discipline in following the command of 
the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission 
for all their actions; from their spirit of a high degree of 
responsibility toward state security; from their fearlessness 
before difficulties; from their indomitable spirit; from their 
efforts to master modern scientific knowledge; from their 
hard-trained military skills; and from their raising the unit's 
fighting strength through rigorous and scientific training. 
Zhang Wannian added that if we want to fulfill the important 
mission entrusted by the party and the people, we need to build 
hundreds and thousands of fighting collectives in the style of 
the "heroic battalion." In particular, we need to give play to 
the heroic battalion's revolutionary and heroic spirit of "dare 
to struggle, dare to win, and dare to crush all enemies" and to 
constantly advance our army's modernization cause. He stressed 
the need for army commanders and fighters to rally closely round 
the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; to be guided by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and by the party's basic line; to greatly 
develop the old Red Army's excellent tradition and the spirit of 
revolutionary heroism; to be tenacious; to be enterprising; and 
to strive to build our army into a strong, modernized, and 
regularized revolutionary army. 
  Air Force Political Commissar Ding Wenchang also spoke at 
the 
meeting.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] An unprecedented number of senior generals have 
gone abroad on diplomatic missions. 
  Western diplomats said this reflected the growing power of 
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in foreign affairs, normally 
the preserve of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Communist Party's International Liaison Department. The 
diplomats said they were particularly surprised by the 
involvement of the regional commanders in "military-style 
diplomacy". 
  Until recently, it was usually senior officers from PLA 
headquarters who went on overseas trips. But on Wednesday, a 
"friendship delegation" led by the Commander of the Chengdu 
Military Region, General Li Jiulong, left Kunming for a tour of 
Burma and Laos. A day earlier, General Wang Ke, Commander of 
the Shenyang Military Region, departed for North Korea. 
  The heads of the various branches of the PLA also have been 
unusually active in diplomacy. Air Force Commander General Cao 
Shuangming and the Vice-Chief of the Navy, General Chen 
Mingshan, are touring Egypt and Tanzania respectively. 
  In the past month, senior generals including the Vice 
Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Zhen, and 
Defence Minister General Chi Haotian have also made aggressive 
statements about Taiwan. For example, while meeting a Zambian 
delegation earlier this week, General Chi said it was absolutely 
not permissible to propagate the scenario of "one China one 
Taiwan". 
  Political sources said the "PLA lobby" had played a role in 
the unusually strong language used by the Chinese media over the 
past month to attack the "pro-independence" stance of Taiwan 
President Lee Tenghui. 
  Apart from Taiwan, advice offered by the top brass has 
affected the leadership's handling of issues such as North 
Korea, sovereignty disputes over the Spratly Islands, and 
Sino-American relations. 
  Western diplomats said the PLA, which had a long tradition 
of 
friendship with North Korea, wanted to use China's influence 
with Pyongyang to exert pressure on Washington. The sources 
said, however, the fact that so many generals were out of China 
was a sign that the leadership was confident of political 
stability in the near term. 
  Meanwhile, several members of the Politburo, including 
President Jiang Zemin, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen, 
have gone on provincial tours in the past fortnight. The 
sources said the leadership was "reasonably assured" that 
patriarch Deng Xiaoping's health would hold up until the Fourth 
Plenum of the Central Committee set for autumn. 
  A major mission of the trips by the politburo members is to 
canvass the support of regional leaders for the economic 
programme which will be tabled at the plenum.

  [Text] At the forefront of flood resistance and disaster 
relief in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong; the central party, 
government, and Army joint task force members spoke highly of 
the People's Liberation Army [PLA] which has "played a key role 
at a crucial time of flood resistance and disaster relief." 
  Zou Jiahua, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political 
Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, led members of the 
central party, government, and Army joint task force to inspect 
some disaster areas in Guangxi and specially conveyed regards to 
officers and men of the PLA, who were fighting floods and 
providing disaster relief. He told them: You, soldiers 
stationed in Guangxi, are doing your best to actively 
participate in flood resistance and disaster relief without 
fearing sacrifice. The local government and people appreciate 
your efforts very much. Without you soldiers, we would not 
possibly make such great achievements in the anti-flood struggle. 
  Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee's 
Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, led members of 
the central party, government, and Army joint task force to 
Changsha. After hearing the Hunan Provincial party committee and 
government's reports on provincial flood resistance and disaster 
relief efforts, Wen Jiabao said: Officers and men of the PLA 
and armed police officers and men carry forward the fine 
tradition of devoting themselves to the people and appear at 
flood-stricken places as soon as possible. The PLA are worthy 
of being called the people's own Army. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng led members of the central 
party, government, and Army joint task force to visit officers 
and men of a certain unit, who have assisted emergencies for 
more than 10 days at the Bei Jiang Dike. He said: The PLA 
played a key role at a crucial time. The hidden hole on the Bei 
Jiang Dike presented an imminent danger. If the PLA had not 
come in time to fix it, the consequences would be very serious. 
  Since serious flooding hit Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan on 
8 
June, soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in 
flood areas have been called out immediately to spare no effort 
in fighting floods and offering disaster relief. Leaders at all 
levels led their men from the front, made careful arrangements, 
and were in command at the forefront of flood resistance and 
disaster relief. As a huge flood peak hit the Bei Jiang Dike, 
General Li Xilin, commander of the Guanzhou Military Region led 
thousands of officers and soldiers in rushing into the danger 
zone. They plugged holes in the dike in time and secured the 
Bei Jiang Dike that is so vital to the safety of the entire Zhu 
Jiang Delta. After Jinman village in Guangxi's Duan county was 
submerged by floodwater, engineering corps of the Guangxi 
Military District got the order to rescue victims there. They 
made a rapid 120 km march to hurry to Jinman village in time and 
evacuated more than 3,000 Jinman residents. The 100-meter 
Xiangjiang Dike in Changsha's Longwang Lane collapsed on the 
morning of 18 June and floodwater seriously threatened the lives 
of more than 40,000 residents. Deng Hanmin, political commissar 
of the Hunan Military District, led more than 260 soldiers in 
quickly fixing the dike by reinforcing it with more than 40,000 
sandbags. They finally headed off disaster. With the weather 
poor and communication difficult, an Air Force unit took 
emergency measures to speedily deliver food to Wuzhou by plane. 
Flood victims hailed them excitedly: Long live the PLA! 
  Carrying forward our Army's spirit in being brave and tough, 
fearing no sacrifice, and fighting tenaciously, officers and men 
participating in flood resistance and disaster relief have been 
fighting floods for 15 days and nights. Their high morale did 
not sink a bit. To rescue 460 people besieged by floodwater, 
officers and men of a engineering regiment jumped into the water 
to safely evacuate them. After having rescued people in several 
flooded areas, more than 600 officers and men of a tank brigade 
received an order to assist in an emergency in Qingyuan city. 
They hurried to the collapsed Huilangzhen Dam and worked 
all-out to achieve a heroic deed -- fighting all day to plug the 
hole on the third dike and rescuing more than 40,000 people and 
their property. 
  As the masses of cadres and soldiers have been highly 
disciplined in their rescue missions, and not encroached on the 
interests of the people in the slightest, they have won praise 
and support from the people. People of Shijiao town, where the 
Bei Jiang Dike is located, hurriedly left their homes when huge 
floods approached. As the rescuing troops entered the town, 
they found that the doors of many shops and houses were still 
open. Cadres and soldiers did not take anything from the open 
houses. Quite the opposite, they organized patrol teams to 
guard property in the shops and houses day and night. When the 
floods receded, people returned and found their homes the same 
as before they left and nothing was missing. They were touched 
and said: The PLA is the people's good troop!

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Guard Against Formalism and Showy </F>
Style of Work--More on Putting Things Into Practice"] 
  [Text] When expounding the question of putting things into 
practice, Chairman Jiang Zemin emphatically stressed guarding 
against formalism and a showy style of work. This important 
instruction is of very great, immediate significance. 
  Approaching things realistically and guarding against 
formalism and a showy style of work is a Marxist principle and 
also a fine tradition of our party and Army. In recent years, 
the Military Commission as well as the General Staff 
Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the General 
Logistics Department have repeatedly stressed this issue. Party 
committees and leading organs at all levels have implemented 
relevant instructions of the Military Commission and the General 
Departments. Various tasks have been implemented satisfactorily 
on the whole. Nevertheless, in the leadership work of a small 
number of units there are still the problems of formalism and a 
showy style of work. Consequently, some tasks failed to be 
fully implemented in grass-roots units. 
  So-called formalism refers to a metaphysical viewpoint, 
method, or style of work which onesidedly concentrates on form 
to the neglect of substance. It is characterized by separation 
of form and substance, preference for form over substance, and 
hankering for superficial spectaculars to the neglect of 
practical results. A so- called showy style of work refers to 
cutting oneself off from the masses, losing contact with 
reality, doing work superficially, and having an unsound style 
of work. Not only will formalism and a showy style of work 
corrupt social values, tarnish the image of cadres, and dampen 
the enthusiasm of the masses, but they will also make the 
party's principles and policies stay at meetings, on papers or 
in mouths, and prevent them from being genuinely implemented to 
the letter. In an essay, "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing" in 
those years, Comrade Mao Zedong incisively analyzed and sharply 
criticized formalism of various forms and regarded them as the 
archenemy of the working class and the Communist Party and as a 
sign of impurity in party spirit. As far as formalism and a 
showy style of work in the Army are concerned, we should all the 
more have a profound understanding of their harmfulness. In 
peacetime, they can seriously hamper the enhancement of our 
combat capability, and in wartime, they can exact a price in 
blood from us. At present, we should meet the needs of the 
macro-climate of developing a socialist market economy and of 
the military strategic principles of the new period. The task 
of accomplishing the general objective of building a modern, 
regular, and revolutionary army is very arduous. As new 
developments and problems are emerging one after another, we 
should work steadily and make solid progress. On no account 
should we indulge in a showy style of work in this regard. We 
should approach elimination of formalism and a showy style of 
work from a political height and eliminate them as an 
"archenemy." 
  When its comes to the harmfulness of formalism and a showy 
style of work, many people bitterly hate them, but in practice, 
never will they be bored with them. The main reason for this 
state of affairs is the way their thinking does mischief, 
namely, hankering after fame and gain, fearing hardship, and 
trying to please the public by claptrap rather than by solid 
work. To eliminate formalism and a showy style of work, we 
should correct our guiding thinking on work. The purpose of our 
work is to promote army building and reform and enhance the 
combat capability of the troops. Proceeding from this purpose, 
we should hold ourselves responsible for both the higher and 
lower levels and on no account should we seek fame and gain and 
do anything that is pleasant to the eye but is of no use. We 
should have a strong sense of revolutionary cause and do solid 
work. We should have an ideological level of being willing to 
be lonely and not being burdened with fame and gain and a drive 
of not stopping until the true state of affairs is clear and 
practical results are achieved. Not only should leading organs 
at all levels be the first to set a good example but they should 
also dare to express, with a clear-cut stand and in clear and 
unequivocal terms, their views to their subordinates on what to 
encourage and what to oppose so that those who do solid work 
will genuinely be looked up to and those who indulge in 
formalism and a showy style of work will draw no benefit 
therefrom. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Formalism is also 
bureaucratism." Facts have proven that formalism and 
bureaucratism are linked together. The latter encourages the 
former, and the former conceals the latter. In studying the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
leaders at all levels should change their leadership style, make 
a priority of linking theory with practical work to do a good 
job of carrying our work in a down- to-earth manner, and exert 
efforts to solve this problem. We should energetically conduct 
investigations and study, try our best to conduct fewer 
upper-level activities, frequently go down to the troops and the 
grass-roots units, take measures to carry out work in light of 
the actual needs of the troops, and attach special importance to 
carrying out regular and basic work in a down-to-earth manner. 
Approaching things realistically and guarding against formalism 
and a showy style of work is a rudimentary requirement and also 
a very high standard. Whether this goal can be achieved or not 
is a test for the comprehensive quality of leading organs and 
cadres. We should have a good mental state and a sense of 
mission and high responsibility for army building, rouse 
ourselves for vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous, 
do solid work with perseverance, and make persistent efforts to 
strive to implement the party's principles and policies and the 
Military Commission's decisions under the guidance of the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence, which have shown strong vitality in the past 40 
years, have become an important part of the norms of 
international relations and played a tremendous role in 
promoting world peace and international friendly cooperation. 
  Addressing a meeting here today to commemorate the 40th 
anniversary of their formulation, Li said these principles 
provide the basis for the establishment and development of 
state-to-state relations. 
  The principles, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference 
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, 
and peaceful co-existence, were jointly advocated by China, 
India and Burma (now Myanmar) in June 1954. 
  Li said that the five principles were born in response to 
the 
call of the times. The spirit of the five principles was 
embodied in the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference 
in 1955 and reaffirmed by the Declaration on Principles of 
International Law Concerning Friendly Relations Among States 
adopted by the 25th session of the UN General Assembly in 1970 
and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International 
Economic Order adopted by the sixth special session of the UN 
General Assembly in 1974. 
  Many documents of international organizations and 
conferences 
also quoted the five principles, he added. 
  Li said that by observing the five principles, countries 
with 
different ideologies, social systems and levels of economic 
development can very well establish mutual trust and friendly 
and cooperative relations; by violating these principles, even 
countries with identical ideologies and social systems may run 
into confrontation and even armed conflict. 
  As a co-initiator of the five principles, he said, China has 
always upheld and observed these principles. 
  China has established diplomatic relations with 158 
countries, carried out exchanges and cooperation with over 200 
countries and regions in the economic, trade, scientific and 
technological and cultural fields, established amicable 
relations with all its neighbors and surrounding countries, and 
has resolved boundary issues left over from the past with most 
of its neighbors, Li added. 
  The Chinese premier added that China has contributed its 
share to peaceful settlement of international disputes, 
promotion of international cooeration and maintenance of 
regional and world peace. 
  Li Peng noted that the past 40 years have witnessed enormous 
changes in the world, the bi-polar structure has come to an end 
while the trend towards multi-polarity is accelerating. 
  International relations are undergoing profound changes. By 
and large, the international situation is moving towards greater 
relaxation of tension, and for an extended period of time, a new 
world war could be averted, Li said, adding that however, the 
end of the Cold War does not mean a trouble-free world. 
  He emphasized that non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs is at the core of the five principles and the new 
international order. 
  The world is a colorful and diversified place as witnessed 
not only by different social systems, values and ideologies, but 
also by different histories, traditions, religious beliefs and 
cultural backgrounds among nations, he said. "Only when we 
recognize these differences and respect one another will it be 
possible to expand cooperation, increase exchanges and live in 
harmony," Li said. 
  To impose one's own values and model of society on others is 
bound to lead to tension and confrontation between states, Li 
said. 
  Li said mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial 
integrity 
and mutual non-aggression and peaceful co-existence between 
states is the basis of the five principles and a new 
international order, Li said. 
  Such actions as undermining or divesting another country of 
its sovereignty, violating or annexing another country's 
territory or resorting to the threat of use of force to advance 
one's own policy under whatever pretext should not be allowed, 
Li said. 
  He pointed out that Deng Xiaoping has made penetrating 
comments on the five principles. Deng had put forth the great 
concept of "one country, two systems" to settle the questions of 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  Deng said: "We have initiated the concept of 'one country, 
two systems' for the settlement of issues concerning China's 
reunification. It will also be a kind of peaceful co-existence." 
  Li said Deng also pointed out that as for some territorial 
disputes between nations, the question of sovereignty may be put 
aside for the time being and joint development may go ahead 
first. 
  "We are actively discussing with the countries concerned 
ways 
of joint development in the disputed areas with a view to 
maintaining peace and stability in the region and averting 
tension," Li said. 
  Equality and mutual benefit of the five principles is a 
principle guiding economic relations, Li said. "Countries 
should learn from each other in economic development and help 
supply each other's needs through mutually-beneficial 
cooperation on an equal footing, whereas trade protectionism of 
any form and exchanges of unequal values are undesirable." 
  Li emphasized that the Chinese people are devoting 
themselves 
heart and soul to the modernization of their country. "We need 
a peaceful international environment and want to develop 
friendly relations and cooperation with all other countries." 
  In conclusion, Li said that holding high the banner of the 
five principles of peaceful co-existence, the Chinese Government 
and people will join other countries in working for the 
establishment of a new international political and economic 
order and for a better future for all mankind.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, 27 Jun (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier 
Li Peng said here today the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence, jointly laid down by China, India, and Burma four 
decades ago, have withstood the tests of a changeable 
international situation, demonstrated strong vitality, and 
played a tremendous role in promoting world peace and 
international friendship and cooperation. 
  Speaking at a meeting marking the 40th anniversary of the 
publication of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, Li 
Peng emphasized: The history of the past four decades has 
testified that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are 
universally applicable norms for international relations, as 
well as the cornerstone for establishing and developing 
relations between countries. He said: If countries with 
different ideologies, social systems, and economic development 
levels can observe the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 
it is entirely possible for them to establish relations of 
mutual trust and friendly cooperation; if these principles are 
violated, confrontation and armed conflicts may take place even 
between countries with an identical ideologies and social 
systems. 
  The meeting was officiated by Qian Qichen, State Council 
vice 
premier and concurrently minister of foreign affairs. Ding 
Guangen, Political Bureau and Secretariat member of the CPC

"Zhongnanhai Shows Concern About Floods] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- Many areas in 
Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi in southern China have 
been deluged by floods since early June. The water levels of 
the Xi Jiang and the Bei Jiang have risen rapidly, areas in the 
Zhujiang Delta are threatened by the biggest floods since the 
founding of the republic, Changsha has been besieged by floods, 
and areas outside Nanchang have been submerged. [passage omitted] 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee 
and chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Premier Li 
Peng have many times telephoned the leaders of the 
flood-stricken provinces and regions and the State Flood Control 
and Drought Relief Headquarters to ask about the floods, the 
damage they have done, the fight against floods, and relief 
efforts. They have also expressed their cordial regards to the 
cadres, masses, officers and men of the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] and the armed police forces, and public security personnel 
engaged in the fight; and instructed party and government 
departments in the flood-stricken areas to make sure that 
people's lives and property are safe, that proper arrangements 
are made for their living necessities, and that the masses are 
organized to combat the disaster. 
  On 15 June, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to Guangdong 
to inspect the flood situation. He has time and again inquired 
about the flood situation there and the arrangements made for 
the flood victims and efforts to combat the floods. When 
informed that Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang were 
all stricken by floods, he immediately gave important 
instructions, urging all principal leaders to organize and lead 
the masses in the stricken areas to fight the floods. He also 
exhorted everybody to demonstrate the socialist system's 
superiority and carry forward the fine tradition that "whenever 
people in one area have problems, people in all other areas will 
come to their support." He said party members, government 
personnel, soldiers, and people should work with concerted 
efforts to battle the floods. 
  On 20 June, the flood situation in southern China became 
more 
critical. In the morning of that day, Premier Li Peng chaired a 
special meeting in Zhongnanhai to further plan the fight against 
south China's floods. When the meeting began, he first conveyed 
Jiang Zemin's important instructions on fighting the floods. 
One day earlier, on the afternoon of 19 June, Premier Li Peng 
had called the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters to inquire about the flood situation. He stressed 
at the meeting that current flood control should give priority 
to ensuring the security of the Bei Jiang embankment and the 
Zhujiang Delta, rescuing those people who have been marooned by 
floodwater, and making sure that people in stricken areas have 
enough food and other necessities, are not stricken by 
epidemics, and have the assistance they need for reconstruction. 
The meeting decided to send central working groups, headed by 
Zou Jiahua, Wen Jiabao, and Chen Junsheng and other leading 
comrades, to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi to combat 
the floods and provide relief services along with local party 
members, government cadres, soldiers, and people. 
  Speaking on behalf of the party Central Committee and the 
State Council, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who was on an inspection 
tour in Liaoning, telephoned Hunan on the morning of 20 June to 
express his regards for the five million soldiers and people 
fighting the floods there. [passage describing the busy work in 
the State Meteorological Center and the State Flood Control and 
Drought Relief Headquarters omitted] 
  At the meeting held on the morning of 20 June, Premier Li 
Peng urged roadway departments to make sure that supplies for 
battling the floods are promptly delivered. On the morning of 
22 June, the first document signed by Guo Lin, vice minister of 
railways, was an emergency circular drafted the night before 
instructing all railway bureaus to ship relief supplies to 
flood-stricken areas ahead of shipments of other goods. The 
circular instructed that "urgent missions must be carried out as 
soon as they are handed down." Since 21 June, persons in charge 
of railways have been working around the clock to take charge of 
the delivery of supplies needed to combat flooding and drought. 
As soon as it received Fujian's telegrams requesting assistance 
on 23 June, the Ministry of Railways immediately dispatched 
eight trains loaded with relief supplies to the flood-stricken 
areas. Relevant departments of the State Council, including the 
ministries of water resources, agriculture, and public health, 
have already done a great deal of work to combat the floods and 
provide relief services. [passage omitted] 
  In accordance with instructions issued by the CPC Central 
Committee and the Central Military Commission, the PLA General 
Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the 
General Logistics Departments issued a joint circular on 20 June 
urging all local units to take an active part in the fight 
against floods and rush to the most dangerous flood-stricken 
areas. [passage omitted]

reporter Wu Huaguo (0702 5478 0948)] 
  [Text] Nanchang, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- A central work team led 
Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat, arrived in Jiangxi from Hunan this morning to 
provide on-the-spot guideance for Jiangxi to conduct 
flood-fighting and relief work and to resume industrial and 
agricultural production. 
  Immediately after disembarking from the plane, Wen Jiabao 
and 
his party -- accompanied by Mao Zhiyong, secretary of the 
Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Governor Wu Guanzheng -- 
successively rushed to the Nanchang Bridge, the Leigongao 
construction work site along the Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway which 
is reserved for vehicles, Weidong Village under Changling Town 
in Xinjian County, and Houtian Township's Sanzhou Village. They 
inspected the flood situation along the Ganjiang River, visited 
the masses of flood victims, and extended greetings and 
appreciation to the servicemembers and civilians who have been 
performing rescue and emergency tasks. The same evening, Wen 
Jiabao and his party earnestly listened to reports by the 
Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and government on Jiangxi's 
flood situation and its flood-fighting and relief work. 
  Wen Jiabao highly commended Jiangxi's servicemembers and 
people for their spirit that stresses fostering unity and 
coordinated efforts, striving to help and rescue themselves, and 
continually fighting when encountering extraordinarily 
disastrous floods. He also fully affirmed Jiangxi's preliminary 
victories in its flood-fighting and relief work. Wen Jiabao 
pointed out: At present, the Ganjiang River's water-level is 
declining, but the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and 
government are still facing very arduous tasks. While 
continually and properly conducting flood-fighting and relief 
work along the Ganjiang River valleys, we should stress 
flood-prevention in the Poyang Lake area and should promptly 
organize the masses in the disaster-stricken areas to resume 
production so as to be self-reliant and to rebuild their homes. 
Jiangxi is a major agricultural province. We should take 
measures to promptly salvage the early-ripening rice, and should 
expand the planting of late-ripening rice and autumn grain as 
much as possible so as to attain a bumper harvest of grain for 
the whole year. While carrying out flood-fighting and relief 
work, we should also continually and properly handle various 
tasks concerning reform, stability, and development in Jiangxi. 
  It has been learned that on 25 June Wen Jiabao and his party 
will visit other localities including Xingan, Fengcheng, and 
Jian where the flooding has been the most serious. They will 
further inspect the flood situation and extend sympathy and 
solicitude to flood victims there.

  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all 
receded along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except 
at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a 
spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters announced today. 
  The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the 
major 
water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses. 
Meanwhile, he said, tension has been eased in the Pearl River 
delta as the latest tropical storm has been weakened after 
landing in Yangjiang city, Guangdong Province. 
  Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and 
Zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods 
which typically hit China from the south to the north from June 
to August. 
  Earlier reports said that successive torrential rainstorms 
in 
the Xijiang and Beijiang river valleys in early and mid-June 
resulted in a big flood, one of the most serious in 100 years, 
in Guangdong Province and caused heavy losses. Major flood 
monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded their highest 
water levels, all four meters above the warning level. 
  In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong 
provincial government urged localities to help flood victims 
with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one 
would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in 
the flooded areas. 
  The province has allocated 300 million kg of grain and 110 
million yuan in cash along with over 10 million tons of such 
farm production supplies as chemical fertilizer and diesel oil 
to the flood-stricken areas. 
  Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million 
yuan in donations have also been sent to flooded areas in 
Guangdong Province. 
  While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi 
Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, 
alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas 
should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts 
and with support from various departments. 
  While inspecting Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and 
Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen said the 
key to mitigating economic losses is to resume production as 
soon as possible. 
  The localities should waste no time in implementing various 
measures to resume production and rehabilitate their homeland, 
he said. 
  As one of China's major bread baskets, Jiangxi is of key 
importance to China in agricultural production, Wen said. It 
has a direct bearing on the grain supply in south China. He 
urged the local governments to farmers resume agricultural 
production.

  [Text] Changsha, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- Speaking in Hunan where 
he was directing the work of combating flood and doing disaster 
relief, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, 
pointed out: To successfully carry out the work of combating 
flood and disaster relief, we must rely on the masses, rely on 
ourselves, work hard, rely on unity between the military and 
civilians, and rely on strong leadership of the party and 
government. Party committees and governments at all levels in 
the disaster area should regard the work of fighting disaster 
and carrying out disaster relief their central task of paramount 
importance at the present stage and should meticulously organize 
the efforts, make overall consideration and all-round 
arrangement, and make an all-out effort to carry out flood 
prevention and disaster relief and to engage in production to 
provide for and help ourselves. 
  From 21 to 23 June, Wen Jiabao led a work group of 
responsible comrades of central party, Army, and government 
departments concerned to the great dike along the Xiangshui and 
to several major disaster areas in Hunan's Changsha, Zhuzhou, 
Xiangtan, and Hengyang, where they inspected the disaster 
situation. On behalf of the party Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the Central Military Commission, they extended 
cordial regards to flood victims as well as to cadres, the 
masses, People's Liberation Army [PLA] commanders and fighters, 
armed police, and public security cadres and officers. Together 
with the local party and government leaders, they studied and 
arranged for flood prevention and disaster relief work. 
  Heavy rainstorm hit areas along the Xiangshui from 12 to 18 
June, creating great flood unseen in 100 years and causing heavy 
losses to industrial and agricultural production and to people's 
lives and property in urban and rural areas along the river. 
After the outbreak of the disaster, under the leadership of the 
Hunan provincial party committee and government and with the 
support of the PLA and armed police units in Hunan, the military 
and civilians in the province spared no efforts in fighting the 
disaster. Their efforts have ensured the safety of Changsha, 
Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Hengyang Cities, as well as the 
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, State Highway 107, and other major 
transportation facilities; reduced losses caused by the 
disaster; and scored initial success in combating flood and 
carrying out disaster relief. At present, the masses in the 
disaster area are calm in their sentiments, society is stable, 
and life is normal. 
  Wen Jiabao fully affirmed Hunan's fight against flood and 
its 
disaster relief work. He urged the military and civilians 
throughout the province to display the dauntless spirit of 
fighting successive battles to win all-around victories in 
fighting the disaster and carrying out relief. 
  After hearing a report on the disaster and observing the 
disaster situation, Wen Jiabao also expressed his views on the 
work of fighting the disaster and carrying out relief. He said: 
The Xiangshui's water level is subsiding. However, its flood 
season has not arrived yet. We must not lower our guard and 
become careless; we must continue to do a good job of preparing 
against big flood and disaster. First, we must step up 
repairing various works damaged by water and reinforcing the 
dike. This is the key to preventing flood. Second, we must 
make adequate arrangement for the victims' daily life, properly 
resolve their food and clothing problems, and carry out public 
health and epidemic prevention work. Third, we must organize 
efforts to provide for and help ourselves and to rebuild our 
homes by engaging in production, and we must restore industrial 
and agricultural production. Fourth, we must strengthen 
ideological-political work to further mobilize the initiatives 
of the vast number of cadres and masses in fighting the disaster 
and carrying out disaster relief. Fifth, we must strengthen 
leadership. Party committees and governments in disaster areas 
must lead the broad masses to rely on themselves and rebuild 
their homeland through thrift and diligence. All departments 
should work closely and provide big support to overcome various 
difficulties. We must unite as one to fight the disaster and 
carry out disaster relief.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- After inspecting areas 
seriously affected by flood in Guangdong, Chen Junsheng, state 
councillor and head of the State Flood Control and Drought 
Relief Headquarters, pointed out: While performing relief work 
at present, we should stress on properly providing food, 
shelter, and medical care to flood victims and on assisting them 
to resume production and to rebuild their homes as soon as 
possible. 
  From 21 to 23 June, after inspecting flood-prevention 
projects at dikes along the Beijiang River in Guangdong, Chen 
Junsheng immediately led a central joint work team, and 
hurriedly travelled over 1,000 kilometers to other 
disaster-stricken areas. He successively inspected four 
counties and districts in Qingyuan, Zhanjinag, and Maoming 
cities that have been seriously affected by flooding. Chen 
Junsheng and his party went into disaster-stricken areas, 
visited households of flood victims, studied the flood 
situation, and extended greetings and appreciation to cadres, 
the masses, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation 
Army [PLA], officers and men of the armed police corps, and 
public security cadres and police who have been performing 
relief work at the forefront in disaster-stricken areas. After 
studying the damage inflicted in the flooded areas and the 
ongoing relief work being carried out, Chen Junsheng said: The 
ongoing relief work has been very well organized and systematic. 
Social order has been good; commodity prices have remained 
stable; the society has been relatively calm; and the feelings 
and spirit of cadres and the masses have been good, too. 
  While holding discussion meetings with leaders at 
provincial, 
city, and county levels in Guangdong, Chen Junsheng laid down 
instructions on relief work at the next stage. He pointed out: 
To resume production and to rebuild flood victims' homes are 
top priorities of our relief work in the next stage. First, we 
should stress on properly providing food, shelter, and medical 
care to flood victims. We must ensure the supply of grain 
rations to flood victims and absolutely no one is allowed to 
starve to death. We should promptly renovate and rebuild houses 
for flood victims so they can regain a stable living environment 
as soon as possible. It is necessary to promote hygiene and 
stress prevention epidemics in an effort to prevent epidemic 
diseases that normally appear after a calamity. Second, we 
should organize personnel to resume production as soon as 
possible. In particular, we should properly handle grain 
production. We should promptly fix up farmland that has been 
destroyed by flooding and replant late-autumn crops. We should 
strive to plant more late-autumn crops so as to harvest more 
later, and cannot afford to miss the right timing. Relevant 
departments should provide support and supply seeds, fertilizer, 
pesticide, and diesel to disaster-stricken areas. When 
renovating facilities that have been destroyed by flooding, we 
should specifically and promptly restore roads, bridges, and 
water conservancy projects. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: Guangdong's recent rescue and 
relief work during the flood has fully demonstrated the rallying 
forces of our party, that of reform and opening up, and that of 
economic progress, and has also fully shown the fighting 
capability of the PLA, that of officers and men of the armed 
police corps, and that of public security cadres and police. 
These rallying forces and their fighting capability were the 
factors that enabled us to secure preliminary victories over our 
first battles fighting a major disaster. He fully affirmed the 
Guangdong format whereby members of its leading bodies, in 
separate groups, respectively went to the forefront of 
disaster-stricken areas to direct rescue and relief work. He 
said: It has been a very good experience. We should 
persistently promote the experience for a long time in the 
future to attain a total victory in the rescue and relief work 
during the flood.

  [Text] In Nanning on the morning of 23 June, a 
Guangxi-bound central work team headed by Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua, a State Council joint work team headed by Fan Baojun and 
Zhang Chunyuan, as well as persons in charge of the central 
departments concerned listened to a flood-resistance work report 
by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin presided over 
the report meeting, at which regional people's government 
Chairman Cheng Kejie reported on the region's torrential rain, 
typhoon, flood, and waterlogging situation over the past few 
months, especially the situation since mid-June this year, 
saying: This year, Guangxi has been hit frequently by a series 
of natural calamities, including such serious natural calamities 
as flooding, waterlogging, and so on, and has suffered enormous 
losses. For instance, the region's 30 poor counties, several 
industrial bases, and two major grain-production bases have been 
hit by flooding and waterlogging. By 21 June, 13 out of 14 
prefectures and cities and 67 out of 86 counties and 
county-level cities in the region had been hit by flooding and 
waterlogging, accounting for 77.9 percent of the region's total. 
In consequence, some 13.93 million people had suffered from 
flooding and waterlogging, accounting for 31 percent of the 
region's total. Preliminary statistics show that the region's 
flooding and waterlogging calamities have left some 224 people 
dead and have caused economic losses worth some 7.274 billion 
yuan. 
  Cheng Kejie noted: Since being hit by flooding and 
waterlogging, the region's troops and people have actively 
thrown themselves into the flood-resistance and disaster-relief 
struggle. The CPC Central Committee, State Council, and Central 
Military Commission have shown great concern for the region's 
afflicted areas. General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li 
Peng have made personal phone calls to the region to ask about 
the situation. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua has led a central work 
team to inspect the region's afflicted areas. In additiohn, the 
principal regional party and and government leaders have led 
cadres to the region's flood-resistance forefront, where they 
have dealt with a large number of emergencies. The cadres at 
all levels, as well as people in the afflicted areas in the 
region have been working hard, day and night, waging a tenacious 
struggle against the floods and braving all sorts of 
difficulties. Some 24,000 locally stationed People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] officers and soldiers have taken part in the region's 
flood-resistance struggle, with the result that many heroes and 
heroic deeds have emerged in the course of dealing with 
emergencies and providing disaster relief. 
  Cheng Kejie noted: Thanks to the week-long flood-resistance 
and disaster-relief work, the situation in the afflicted areas 
has stabilized and returned to normal. 
  After listening to the region's flood-resistance work 
report, 
Vice Premier Zou Jiahua made an important speech in which he 
discussed Guangxi's flood-resistance work. 
  First and foremost, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, 
State Council, and Central Military Commission, Zou Jiahua 
extended cordial greetings to the region's party, government, 
and military leaders at all levels; the locally stationed PLA 
officers and soldiers taking part in the region's 
flood-resistance and disaster-relief work; and the broad masses 
of people in the afflicted areas. He said: Guangxi has 
successfully waged a struggle against flooding and has scored 
excellent results in this regard. While carrying on the 
flood-resistance struggle in the future, Guangxi should continue 
to carry forward the spirit of working hard and fearing no 
hardships; strengthen confidence; brace up; enhance solidarity; 
and rely on the party, government, people's troops, and broad 
masses of the people in tiding over difficulties and building 
the urban and rural areas into better places than before the 
flood disaster. 
  Speaking of specific antiflood measures, Zou Jiahua pointed 
out: At most, we should strive, first of all, to protect 
people's lives and property, rescue people besieged by the 
flood, take precautions against future floods, heighten 
vigilance, and never slacken our efforts against natural 
calamities. As this year's flood season has just begun, Guangxi 
probably will witness more floods over the next two months. In 
view of this situation, we should make proper arrangements for 
people's livelihood; organize people to resume production by 
relying on themselves; mobilize people, households, and villages 
to help each other, urban areas to help rural areas, and 
unaffected areas to help afflicted areas; and carry out 
meticulous and down-to-earth work to this end. 
  Comrade Zou Jiahua stated: The central work teams are formed 
by comrades in charge of various central ministries and 
commissions. The central organs concerned should make unreserved 
efforts to assist and contribute to Guangxi's flood-resistance 
and disaster-relief work. He urged the relevant central organs 
to take the initiative to actively and unreservedly support 
Guangxi's flood-resistance struggle by enhancing coordination 
among themselves. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua concluded his speech by saying: I am 
fully confident that with the concern of the CPC Central 
Committee and State Council and the assistance of the locally 
stationed PLA troops, and under the direct leadership of the 
regional party and government leaders, the Guangxi people of all 
nationalities will be able to tide over all sorts of 
difficulties and bring their flood-resistance struggle to a 
successful end. 
  Comrades in charge of the relevant State Council departments 
also delivered speeches at the report meeting. 
  It has been learned that on the afternoon of 23 June, Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua and his entourage left Nanning on board a 
special plane.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Chuanzhen (3769 0278 4176)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
fact-finding trip to flood-stricken areas in Guangdong, Xie Fei, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, rallied and 
called on all cadres and people to provide for themselves and 
help each other by engaging in production with the assistance of 
all quarters, and to do all they can to make up for losses 
caused by the disaster, in a spirit of motivation, collectivism, 
and self-reliance. 
  From 23 to 25 June, Xie Fei led officials in charge of the 
provincial party committee, government, and military district to 
assess disaster damage in Qingyuan, Yingde, and Shaoguan, as 
well as on the the Bei Jiang dike. They also studied specific 
disaster control and relief measures and procedures. 
  Since mid-June, Guangdong has been stricken by this year's 
No. 3 strong tropical storm and by the largest flood since New 
China's founding. The storm and flood have affected more than 
11 million people in nine cities and 60 counties and districts, 
and caused heavy economic losses. 
  The Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and government have 
taken decisive and effective measures to protect the Bei Jiang 
dike, which plays an important role in ensuring the safety of 
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and the Zhujiang delta region. Party, 
government, and military leaders at all levels have taken the 
lead by directing the evacuation of people on the frontline of 
flood control and relief operations and by saving state property 
and stranded disaster victims. Many moving deeds have come to 
the fore. 
  Xie Fei commended primary party organizations in 
disaster-stricken areas for displaying fighting power at the 
crucial moment. He said: Faced with the flood, grass-roots 
cadres and CPC members in the countryside have played a vanguard 
and exemplary role by rescuing disaster victims and protecting 
people's interests without regard for their personal safety. 
The People's Liberation Army [PLA] has played a crucial role at 
the critical moment. Facts confirm the presence of PLA troops 
in every disaster-stricken area. 
  During the trip, Xie Fei showed deep concern for clothing, 
food, housing, and health care for disaster victims. He often 
had conversations with senior citizens, women, village cadres, 
party branch secretaries, town administrative heads, and 
peasants working in the fields. He was very pleased to see that 
cadres and people in disaster-stricken areas were in high 
spirits, had great trust in the party and government, and were 
confident of overcoming the disaster. He was particularly glad 
to learn that, thanks to rescue operations launched by all 
quarters, not a single person had died of starvation or disease 
or had been forced by famine to flee their hometown. 
  Xie Fei said emphatically: Party and government departments 
at all levels should continue working to ensure that people in 
disaster-stricken areas will lead a stable life, to keep the 
markets there stable, and to ensure social stability. He noted: 
The primary task of the moment in disaster-stricken areas is to 
resume production quickly by all means, to ensure high yields 
and bumper harvests of late crops, and to tend winter-planted 
crops as if they were single crops to make up for losses 
inflicted on early crops. Authoritative command posts for 
disaster relief operations should be set up at the provincial, 
city, and county levels so that relief operations will be 
carried out in earnest under unified leadership, in 
coordination, and through common efforts and shared 
responsiblity. Banking, insurance, civil affairs, industrial, 
communications, agricultural, public health, commercial, and 
public security departments at all levels should show strong 
motivation and enthusiasm, and go all-out to assist 
disaster-stricken areas. Leaders at all levels should mobilize, 
rely on, organize, and help the masses to overcome difficulties. 
  Xie Fei told party and government leaders in 
disaster-stricken areas: The floods have taught us a good 
lesson. From now on, we should pay attention to harnessing big 
rivers and to building water conservancy projects, and give 
priority to disaster prevention in modernization. 
  Accompanying Xie Fei on his fact-finding trip were Wen 
Yuzhu, 
commander of the Guangdong Provincial Military District, and 
officials in charge of relevant departments.

  [Text] Hong Kong, June 26 (XINHUA) -- A political party 
entitled the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong 
(DABHK) is to solicit donations from local residents for the 
flood-stricken Chinese provinces today. 
  It will install relief fund boxes at 34 sections in major 
streets on the Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon and the New 
Territories, calling passers-by to offer help to flood-affected 
population. 
  It is reported that the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY has received 126 million HK [Hong Kong] dollars (16.1 
million U.S. dollars) of relief funds provided by people in all 
walks of life in Hong Kong so far. 
  Meanwhile, the Red Cross Society of Hong Kong has collected 
a 
donation of 7.58 million HK dollars (971,700 U.S. dollars) by 
yesterday. It has used 4 million dollars to purchase goods 
badly needed in the flood-hit areas and delivered the goods to 
China. 
  The Asia Television Station of Hong Kong raised 7.98 million 
HK dollars (one million U.S. dollars) by staging a charity 
performance on July 24. 
  The Chinese newspaper "WEN WEI PO" got 610,000 HK dollars 
(78,200 U.S. dollars) of relief funds yesterday, making the 
total sum of donation it has received so far to 7.1 million HK 
dollars (910,200 U.S. dollars). 
  Heavy rains from tropical storm Sharon hit some southern 
Chinese provinces last night worsening the disaster which has 
already claimed nearly 800 lives. 
  Flood has washed away 1.7 million homes, damaged 
embankments, 
wiped out large tracts of rice and vegetable fields in much of 
the six southern Provinces.

  [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The standing committee 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held its seventh meeting here 
today, focusing on agriculture. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, 
presided over the meeting. 
  He said that, as agriculture is the foundation of the 
national economy, its development has a direct impact on the 
economy, people's life and social stability. 
  The agricultural issue is very much a matter of concern for 
the people, he said. The central committee of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC) and the State Council attach great 
importance to agriculture, having worked out a series of 
important policies. 
  Li pointed out that, as an institution participating in and 
discussing state and government affairs, the CPPCC is bound to 
be concerned about China's agriculture and give its suggestions 
and opinions on the issue. 
  Chinese State Councillor Chen Junsheng attended the meeting 
and delivered a report on agriculture. 
  Chen said that, in general, the current situation of 
agriculture and the rural economy is good. The country has 
achieved good harvests for many years successively, the rural 
economy has achieved consistent and all-round development, and 
farmers'income and living standards have improved. 
  But, he noted, some problems still exist in China's 
agriculture and rural economy, which can not be ignored, in the 
process of the rapid development of the national economy and 
readjustment of the economic system. 
  Chen said that the problems are mainly an imbalance in 
general grain supply and demand, disequilibrium of agricultural 
production structure between areas, gap between cotton supply 
and demand, uneven production of vegetables, slow increase of 
farmers' income, lack of funds, unemployment of rural laborers, 
constant growth of rural population and shrinking of cultivated 
land. 
  The development of agriculture also faces a shortage of 
scientists and technicians, a withering of agriculture 
production in the coastal areas and hiking of the prices of farm 
production materials. Also there are 80 million 
poverty-stricken people in the rural areas, Chen added. 
  Chen spoke highly of the CPPCC's concern about and 
contributions to China's agriculture and rural economy. The 
members have put forward many opinions and suggestions for 
building up a new and prosperous countryside in China, he noted. 
  He expressed the hope that the CPPCC would continue making 
contributions to the development of agriculture and the rural 
economy. 
  The five-day meeting will also discuss reports on CPPCC 
members' tours of Anhui, Henan and Shanxi Provinces, on Li 
Ruihuan's visit to five western and northern European countries, 
the visit of Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee, to the Republic of Korea, and a report on a CPPCC 
delegation's visit to Jordan and Djibouti. 
  The meeting will also discuss and adopt a list of 
appointments and removals concerning the Eighth National 
Committee of the CPPCC.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Hongwei (2621 1347 0251) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Chen Weiping (7115 5398 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- A literary and artistic 
performance was held to mark the 1994 university graduates' 
evening in Beijing this evening. Before the show began, Li 
Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and vice premier of the State Council, cordially met with 
representatives of the graduates from Beijing's colleges and 
universities. 
  After listening to speeches by representatives of the 
college 
graduates, Li Lanqing said: In 1994, 650,000 college graduates 
will leave their campuses, and will report to their work posts 
where they will make contributions to the motherland. On behalf 
of the party Central Committee and the State Council, I extend 
our warm congratulations to all China's college graduates, while 
expressing our good wishes to all the students present and 
indicating our heartfelt respects to those students who are 
departing shortly to work in impoverished areas, including 
Tibet. Your future is as great as the sky where you can soar 
like a bird, and is as vast as the ocean where you can dive like 
a fish. I hope that after you have reported to your work posts, 
you will use your intelligence and talents in your various 
fields and contribute to enhancing China's socialist 
modernization drive. 
  He said: Reform and opening up have brought enormous changes 
in China and have enabled China to accomplish achievements in 
economic construction and social development that have attracted 
global attention. However, we should also notice: China has a 
vast territory and its regional development has been very 
uneven. Some localities, particularly remote border areas, are 
still quite backward. The construction of these places will all 
the more require a large number of specially-trained 
professionals. Their development will depend on meritorious 
service and prospective undertakings to be made by inspired, 
ambitious youths. 
  Li Lanqing said: In a new era when the socialist market 
economy is developing, some people's value systems have changed: 
They fear the test of enduring hardships in life. 
Nevertheless, students present here requested, of their own 
accord, to go to places, where you are most needed by the 
motherland, to do pioneering work and to make use of your 
talents there. It has fully demonstrated the exalted loftiness 
of our contemporary youths. I feel that this is precisely where 
China's hope lies and the broad masses of youths should learn 
from these pioneers. 
  While addressing the attendees, Li Lanqing mentioned two 
things expected of them: 
  First, you should continue to study. To understand the 
modernization drive so as to keep pace with the times, you 
should study scientific and cultural knowledge. Furthermore, 
you should also learn from society, from the masses of local 
people, and from comrades around you. Whatever you have learned 
from campuses can only be regarded as a foundation-laying stage. 
After you report to your work posts, it is most important that 
you continually learn from actual practice. 
  Second, you should seize opportunities and face challenges. 
After you begin working, you will probably encounter various, 
sometimes even unexpected, problems and setbacks. All of you 
should be fully prepared mentally. When you fail, you should 
not feel dejected or discouraged; on the contrary, you should 
seek support and help from various organizations. Relying on 
the unique graceful bearing and talents of the young 
intellectuals in the nineties, you should successively overcome 
a series of problems so as to justify the party's great trust 
and the people's high expectations of you. 
  At this evening's show, teachers and students from the 
Beijing Aerospace University, the Beijing University, the 
Qinghua University, the Fudan University, and the Suzhou Silk 
Industry College performed their own programs. Watching the 
show were responsible people from relevant departments including 
Zhu Kaixuan, Zhang Tianbao, Shen Rongjun, Yang Weiguang, Chen 
Changben, and Ma Shukuan, and more than 1,000 current graduates 
of various Beijing colleges. The show was held under the 
auspices of the State Education Commission and the China Central 
Television Station, and was assisted by Shenzhen Junan 
Securities Company Limited.

0081 0081): "Sidelights of Zhu Rongji's Inspection in Jilin"] 
  [Text] Changchun, 25 June (WEN WEI PO)--Between 14 and 18 
June, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji inspected work in Jilin Province, 
helped the province solve problems arising in economic 
development, and discussed major economic issues with principal 
party and government leaders of the province. 
  Zhu Rongji's entourage included more than 60 senior 
officials 
from various ministries and commissions of the State Council. 
They were divided into six separate groups for investment 
projects, state-owned enterprises, rural fair markets, financial 
and taxation affairs, foreign trade, and banking affairs. They 
joined the departments and enterprises concerned in Jilin in 
considering and resolving various problems. 
  Zhu Rongji himself focused attention on the grain issue and 
problems with the large state-owned enterprises. Jilin is 
China's largest commodity grain production base. On 10 June, 
the prices of various foodstuffs in all parts of China were 
raised. Zhu Rongji inquired in detail about the prices, 
storage, and circulation of grain in Jilin. In Gongzhuling 
City, which is located south of Changchun, Zhu Rongji inspected 
the state's grain reserve warehouses and visited local peasants 
and a rural fair market. When Zhu was told by local grain 
officials that they did not issue even one single IOU to 
peasants last year, Zhu Rongji said seriously: "IOUs have 
become a thing of the past and will never appear any more." When 
Zhu Rongji called on peasant Zhou Shuwen, the host said that he 
regretted having sold grain too early and not waiting until 
grain prices were raised. Zhu Rongji smiled and said: "This 
year, you can still sell grain at the good price. As long as 
you make efforts to produce more grain and also develop 
sidelines, you will certainly build up a family fortune." Zhou 
Shuwen's daughter gave the guests strawberries the family grew 
themselves. Zhu Rongji said wittily: "The girls here are 
prettier than those in Changchun." 
  At the fair market, Zhu Rongji inquired about grain prices. 
When being told that grain prices had not increase but slightly 
decreased, Zhu Rongji was pleased. At a meeting, he said that 
without substantial agricultural development, there would be no 
substantial development in the economy as a whole, and the state 
must adopt macroeconomic measures to effectively stabilize the 
price of chemical fertilizer when raising the grain prices. 
  On the afternoon of 17 June, Zhu Rongji met with officials 
of 
the relevant departments of Jilin Province, and expressed his 
opinion on various economic issues. When talking about the 
national economic situation, Zhu Rongji said: The situation is 
good, not just ordinarily good but very good, much better than 
that in the same period of last year. As for the situation in 
Jilin, Zhu said: The situation is good; there remains great 
potential; the momentum of develop will last; difficulties still 
exist; and there are also solutions. On the spot, the officials 
of the relevant ministries and commissions of the State Council 
solved 21 of the 22 issues the Jilin provincial authorities 
requested assistance with from the central authorities. The 
central authorities also decided to give a certain amount of 
financial subsidies to Jilin in order to help the province boost 
its economy. 
  Zhu Rongji's team worked with high efficiency, and they 
often 
worked late into the night. They often did not eat at the same 
time, and those who finished the meal might leave first in order 
to continue their work. The time for social courtesy was 
reduced. 
  At an evening show held in Changchun City, Zhu Rongji 
listened to famous Peking opera singer Zhang Chunqiu's recital, 
and applauded while listening to a local official's explanation 
of the story. The opera singer recognized Zhu Rongji and asked 
him to play the erhu. Zhu gladly and skillfully played the erhu 
to accompany the singing. The audience applauded, and the 
atmosphere was animate. 
  Some senior provincial officials told this reporter that Zhu 
Rongji's inspection tour gave substantial assistance to the 
province in solving some major issues, and the concerted efforts 
made by the central and local authorities were inspiring. They 
said that Vice Premier Zhu's highly efficient style of work was 
impressive and also set a good example for us.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Zheng Wei (6774 5588) and </F>
correspondent Zheng Jianping (6774 1696 1627): "Healthy 
Practices and Quality Services Reign in Shanghai Post and 
Telecommunications Administration -- Wei Jianxing Affirms These 
Achievements During Inspection Tour of Shanghai; Post and 
Telecommunications Ministry Decides To Promote the 
Administration's Experience in Relevant Departments Throughout 
the Country"] 
  [Text] During his recent inspection tour of Shanghai, Wei 
Jianxing, secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, noted: The Shanghai Post and Telecommunications 
Administration's experience deserves to be summed up and can be 
used as a reference for remedying sector-wide unhealthy 
practices across the nation. The Post and Telecommunications 
Ministry's leading party group recently decided to promote the 
administration's experience and practices in providing quality 
services to the public and its customers in post and 
telecommunications departments throughout the country with a 
view to further promoting bureau-specific healthy practices in 
the nation's post and telecommunications sector. This was 
disclosed by Chang Yan, head of the discipline inspection group 
sent by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission to work at 
the Post and Telecommunications Ministry, at a news briefing 
held by the ministry's leading party group in Shanghai yesterday. 
  In recent years, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications 
Administration has provided quality services as part of its 
intensive efforts to remedy unhealthy practices. It has taken 
the initiative in serving the telecommunications market, tried 
its best to satisfy the public's needs, and pulled ahead of its 
counterparts in other parts of the country in redressing 
sector-wide unhealthy practices, in improving bureau-specific 
practices, and in providing quality services. 
  While energetically developing postal and telecommunications 
services, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications 
Administration has earnestly provided quality services and 
promoted industrious and honest practices. Since 1992, the 
administration has carried out activities to promote quality 
services "aimed at satisfying market demand and guaranteeing 
satisfaction to customers." It has provided services to solve 
problems of concern to the general public. To improve telephone 
services, for example, it has increased the number of public 
telephones, set up nighttime emergency and public telephone 
offices, made private telephones available for public use, and 
extended service hours, thus effectively relieving inadequate 
telephone services for local residents. It has provided special 
services for the old, weak, sick, and disabled; 355,000 people 
falling under this category are now enjoying these special 
services. Moreover, the administration has provided newspapers 
and mail home delivery services for more than 2,500 childless 
and widowed senior citizens in Shanghai. It has also provided 
"integrated" services, handled telephone and telecommunications 
services on behalf of other departments, and instituted measures 
such as those "creating a single window for receiving documents 
and introducing a single official seal for use in dealings with 
its customers." 
  The Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Administration has 
set up a sound and effective administrative system, thereby 
institutionally suppressing the sources of unhealthy practices. 
For instance, the municipal telephone office has placed 
telephone numbers and telephone lines under centralized and 
unified management. It has also stepped up management, 
supervision, and control over work units, thereby effectively 
halting the unhealthy practice of abusing telephone numbers and 
telephone lines. Additionally, the administration has recruited 
2,768 superintendents from among the public, carried out 
year-round education on occupational ethics, and selected 
advanced models on a timely basis. It has also incorporated 
service indicators, such as "user complaint and satisfaction 
rates," in unit- and job-based responsibility systems, and 
strictly meted out rewards and punishments. In the municipal 
telephone office alone, six people have been dismissed for 
violations of disciplinary rules.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Ren Jianxin, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the 
Central Committee on Politics and Law, said here today that it 
is necessary to treat the campaign for publicizing and educating 
people on the legal system's importance as a long-term task and 
be persistent in carrying it out. He also said that further 
efforts should be made to strengthen the publicity campaign to 
enhance people's common knowledge about various legal aspects 
and continuously achieve more solid effects so as to keep step 
with the development of legal system construction in China. 
  Ren Jianxin's comments came in a speech at a forum marking 
the first anniversary of the "Educational Corps for Assisting 
the State's Middle- and High-Ranking Cadres To Study Law." Ren 
Jianxin said: The effort to publicize and educate people on the 
legal system's importance is a basic task in China's legal 
system construction. It is also a major characteristic of our 
legal system construction. The corps was formed at a time when 
China is accelerating its pace to establish a socialist market 
economy. The corps is a good way to promote the campaign for 
publicizing and educating people on the legal system's 
importance, help the broad masses of cadres, and particularly 
middle- and high-ranking cadres, enhance their legal sense of 
the market economy's importance. The work, which is organized 
by the Propaganda Department, the Justice Ministry, and the 
China Law Society, is of great significance. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out: During the course of establishing 
and perfecting a socialist economic system, we should popularize 
legal knowledge about the market economy, enhance people's legal 
sense of importance about the market economy, maintain social 
stability, and guarantee proper order of the market economy. It 
is an important task to publicize and educate people on the 
legal system's importance. The task will remain so for a long 
time to come. Extensive efforts should be made to instill the 
idea of the legal system into the minds of citizens, and 
particularly leading cadres, so that leading cadres at all 
levels will foster the legal system idea for a socialist market 
economy. Practice proves that whether or not leading cadres at 
all levels have a sense of importance about the legal system and 
their ability to make decisions and carry out their duties in 
accordance with the law play an important role in promoting 
socialist modernization. It is impossible for a leader who does 
not understand the law or who has never used legal means to 
manage economic and social affairs to become a good and 
conscientious leader. He expressed his hopes that, through 
conducting classes on the legal system, the teachers of the 
corps will not only help leaders of the organs of the CPC 
Central Committee and the state as well as leaders at 
provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional levels master 
legal knowledge but also further foster an idea of the market 
economy. It is imperative to let leading cadres at all levels 
have a better understanding of the fact that a sound legal 
system is needed to guarantee the establishment and perfection 
of a socialist market system. In an attempt to establish and 
develop a socialist market economy, all leading cadres must take 
a lead in studying law, using law, and carrying out duties in 
accordance with the law. 
  It was learned that, since the corps' establishment, 13 
senior lecturers have given more than 10 lectures on the legal 
system to leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and state 
organs, including the Geology and Mineral Resources Ministry and 
the State Meteorological Bureau, as well as to major responsible 
comrades of Jiangsu, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and other localities. 
These lectures include corporate law, regulations on the change 
of operating mechanisms in state-owned industrial enterprises, 
amendments to the Constitution, and stocks and bonds. On top of 
that, another 11 senior lecturers have recorded 13 video 
lectures on the legal system regarding the market economy. The 
videotaped lectures have been released to 27 provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country. 
  The forum was jointly sponsored by the Propaganda 
Department, 
the Justice Ministry, and the China Law Society. China Law 
Society Chairman Zou Yu presided over the meeting. Justice 
Minister Xiao Yang also spoke at the meeting. Some members of 
the corps also expressed their opinions and suggestions about 
improving the campaign.

  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Li 
Guiren has been released from prison after serving a sentence 
for his role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, friends said 
Sunday. Li, 51, was released Saturday from his prison in the 
central city of Xian. The sources said he was weak and in poor 
health. 
  The former journalist was arrested June 26, 1989. He was 
sentenced to five years jail for "anti-revolutionary propaganda" 
in February 1991. The dissident had organised a strike at the 
Xian publishing house where he was chief editor and openly 
supported deposed Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang during the 
pro-democracy demonstrations that were brutally suppressed in 
1989. He was freed on parole in February 1993 for medical 
treatment after suffering severe heart problems but continued 
his pro-democracy activities and was imprisoned again in 
February of this year. 
  Li's family said he was refused proper treatment while in 
hospital.

  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Newly-started phone-in 
programs have given Beijing residents easy access to TV and 
radio to voice opinions and vent feelings. 
  A group of passengers called in to tell the Beijing-based 
CCTV, China's only national TV station, that they intended to 
sue a domestic airline over a delayed flight. 
  Three days after CCTV covered the issue in a peak-hour 
program called "Focus Moment," the Civil Aviation Administration 
of China (CAAC) put out new rules for airline companies to 
compensate delayed travelers. 
  "Focus Moment," whose hot-line paging number is publicized 
nation-wide, received hundreds of telephone calls from all over 
the country. 
  Zhang Haichao, producer of the program, said that it is one 
of the most popular programs in the capital because ordinary 
people want to have their own voices on the air. 
  Like CCTV, all TV and radio stations in Beijing are 
government sponsored. Most of them have broadcast phone-in 
programs in the past two years, which enjoyed wide popularity 
that promises good returns. 
  Wang Liang, director of the Beijing Communications Radio 
Station, said that these programs are encouraged by the 
government because they are "close to the people and to life." 
The government has stipulated that in a market economy, the 
media must operate both with good social efficacy and good 
economic returns. 
  Wang, former director of the Beijing Economic Radio Station, 
opened the first live phone-in broadcast program in Beijing a 
few years ago. 
  He said that in such a program, the studio speakers are open 
to questions from all kinds of people, regardless of the 
callers' age, literacy or background. 
  People found a vent for their anger at some problems in 
daily 
life through such phone-ins. 
  Recently, many people called in to the traffic radio station 
to complain about chronical traffic jams at a busy fly-over in 
west Beijing. 
  The radio station reported: "the bridge design is 
inefficient," and it suggested drivers should go by other 
routes. Many people took the advice and the jam at the bridge 
improved. The complaints have dropped off. 
  Most of the radio and TV stations learn in what topic the 
audience are most interested through letters and phone calls. 
They also do regular or occasional surveys to see what is their 
share of the potential audience. 
  Some hot-line programs are done from the site of an 
incident, 
so people can get information from the background sounds and 
pictures. Sometimes, candid cameras are used to record illicit 
activities. 
  Beijing residents like these programs better than the 
others. 
A CCTV survey showed that its hot-line program "Oriental Time 
and Space" has the second slot in audience rating among all its 
programs, beaten only by the news.

<F P=106> [From the "Night News" program] </F>
  [Text] On the eve of the International Anti-Drug Day on 26 
June, various localities have taken actions to severely punish 
numerous drug traffickers and have openly destroyed large 
quantities of drugs, fully demonstrating their resolve to crack 
down on drug trafficking. The following are reports from some 
localities: 
  News from Sichuan today says, from January to May this year, 
the Sichuan provincial police cracked more than 500 drug 
trafficking cases, captured more than 700 drug traffickers, and 
seized nearly 50 kg of heroin, 13 kg of opium, and some other 
drugs. The province recently openly burned the seized drugs and 
severely punished a number of drug traffickers, of whom 14 
criminals have been executed. 
  It has been learned that, over the last few years, because 
the anti-drug efforts have been stepped up in Yunnan, Guangzhou, 
and other localities, blocking the original drug trafficking 
channels, some drug traffickers have turned to Sichuan, making 
Sichuan a new transfer point and distribution center for transit 
drugs. [video shows a police officer setting fire to drugs while 
a large group of people watch] 
  The Fujian Provincial Higher People's Court recently tried 
nine drug smuggling and trafficking cases in Xiamen, Quanzhou, 
and Zhangzhou. Sentences were handed down on 29 criminals, of 
whom 10 -- whose death sentences had been approved by the 
Supreme People's Court -- were executed after their death 
sentences were announced. Four of the 10 criminals executed were 
from Taiwan. [video shows several people escorted by police 
officers listening to court rulings, then being escorted out of 
the court] 
  In another report, the Fujian provincial and Fuzhou city 
anti-drug committees recently burned in Changle County more than 
780 kg of drugs seized by the Fujian provincial police in the 
last two years. [video shows police officers burning drugs in a 
field] 
  It has been learned that, from January to May this year, 
Fujian uncovered 38 drug trafficking cases, destroyed 
underground drug processing installations set up by lawless 
elements from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and clamped down on a number 
of drug processing and trafficking rings. 
  In another development, Shaanxi Province recently held 
rallies in Xian, Yulin, Weinan, and Xianyang, to announce the 
court rulings on 11 drug processing and trafficking cases. 
Among the 51 sentenced drug traffickers, 13 were sentenced to 
death and subsequently executed, eight were sentenced to death 
with temporary suspension of execution, and 11 were sentenced to 
life imprisonment. It has been learned that this action was the 
most extensive Shaanxi has taken since the liberation of the 
country in cracking down on drug trafficking. [video shows 
soldiers escorting people to an open-air court where they listen 
to court rulings while hundreds of people watch] 
  In Shanghai, 26 people were recently sentenced to life 
imprisonment or given jail terms for transporting, selling, or 
possessing drugs. News from Shenzhen says Shenzhen and other 
localities will hold open trials tomorrow -- the International 
Anti-Drug Day -- to try some drug traffickers. [video shows a 
dozen or so people sitting in a Shanghai courtroom, and some

  [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Jun (XINHUA) -- At the glorious 
starting point of China's antinarcotics campaign -- the Humen 
Town Opium War Memorial Hall in Dongguan City, Guangdong 
Province -- over 1,430 kg of heroin, opium, and marijuana were 
reduced to ashes by four pyres of raging flames this morning. A 
large-scale antinarcotics campaign was launched by Guangdong 
this year to mark the International Antinarcotics Day had 
unfolded. 
  The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court recently 
circulated a notice on efforts made by people's courts at all 
levels in the province to focus on pronouncing judgments and 
carrying out sentences on narcotics-related criminal cases. On 
25 June, 12 cities in the province, including Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Zhongshan, simultaneously pronounced 
judgements on and carried out sentences given to 180 criminal 
elements involved in narcotics cases -- including death 
sentences given to 46 of these criminal elements, death 
penalties with a suspension of execution given to 13 of them, 
life imprisonment given to 12 of them, and fixed-term 
imprisonment of more than five years given to 83 of them. 
  According to relevant responsible person of the Guangdong 
Provincial Public Security Bureau, right now Guangdong Province 
still faces a very grim situation in narcotics crimes. In view 
of that, the Guangdong Provincial Narcotics Control Commission 
urged vigorous efforts to intensify propaganda and efforts to 
wage an antinarcotics people's war. The Guangdong Provincial 
party committee and government made arrangements to launch 
provincewide, a mammoth, unified antinarcotics campaign in the 
latter half of this year so as to effectively check the rising 
trend in the province's narcotics crimes.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Thirteen people from 
northwest China's Shaanxi Province were sentenced to death today 
by the provincial supreme people's court for making narcotics or 
trading in them, and the sentence was immediately carried out. 
  Criminal Ma Zhanyu was sentenced to death by Qinghai 
Provincial Supreme People's Court for trading in heroine and was 
executed today. 
  Eight other people in Shaanxi Province were also sentenced 
to 
death, but carrying out of the sentence was suspended. Another 
11 people were given life imprisonment. 
  Nineteen more people were sentenced to set terms of 
imprisonment, all for making and trading in narcotics. 
  Ma Shuanzhi, vice-president of the Shaanxi Provincial 
Supreme 
People's Court, said at today's news briefing that narcotics 
dealer Zhang Fuqiang, a farmer from the province's Mizhi County 
and the principal culprit, together with several other 
criminals, had purchased 39,000 g of heroine between July 1988 
and July 1989 and transported and sold them in Guangzhou. 
  According to the vice-president, Zhang alone had purchased 
and resold at high profits narcotics weighing 33,850 g. 
  The 13 criminals were executed separately this morning in 
four places: Xian, Yulin, Weinan and Xianyang in the province, 
in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme People's Court in 
Beijing. 
  Meanwhile, the Intermediate People's Court of Yulin 
Prefecture today publicly burned 3,670 g of seized narcotics. 
  Moreover, local departments of public security and 
procuratorates of Qinghai Province, also in northwest China, 
dealt with 18 cases of drug-dealing crimes and arrested 27 
criminals in the first five months of this year. 
  In east China, the Fujian Provincial Narcotics Control 
Committee and Fuzhou City Narcotics Control Committee set fire 
to 784 kg of narcotics this morning in a village of the 
province's Changle County. 
  The narcotics were seized by local departments of public 
security in anti-drug operations in the past two years. 
  In the first five months of this year, the province dealt 
with 38 cases involving making or speculating in narcotic drugs, 
arrested 117 criminals and seized 86 kg of narcotics. 
  The province also destroyed secret dens set up by

<F P=106> [By station reporter Meng Huchun (1322 0729 2504); from the </F>
"Xinjiang News" program] 
  [Text] Yesterday morning, the Urumqi City Intermediate 
People's Court held an open trial and pronounced first-instance 
judgments on (Ma Yan), (Huang Zhong), and 21 other major 
criminals involved in 12 drug-related cases. A total of 11 
people engaged in large-volume drug trafficking -- (Ma Yan), (Ma 
Zhigang), (Huang Zhong), (Genghis Moli), (Feng Zhenghe), (Su 
Musha), (Rebiya Maimaiti), (Shadaiti Adili), (Wang Zhengbang), 
(Tohai Lino), and (Yang Xujie) -- were in the first instance 
sentenced to death and stripped of political rights for the rest 
of their lives. The other 12 drug traffickers received either 
life imprisonment or term imprisonments ranging from three to 15 
years. [video opens with long shots of an assembly hall with a 
capacity audience, and police escorting handcuffed criminals 
into the hall; some of those sentenced are shown in closeups] 
  With its solemn and just punishment of these drug 
traffickers, the people's court has punctured the arrogance of 
drug criminals, fully shown the people's government's consistent 
stance of strictly prohibiting drugs, and determination to 
thoroughly wipe out all illicit drugs.

<F P=106> [CHINA DAILY Commentary: "Anti-Drug War"] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow will be the International Day Against Drug 
Abuse, an occasion designed to raise people's awareness of the 
danger of narcotics. 
  China, the biggest victim of opium in the 19th century, 
knows 
best the deadly effect of drugs on a nation as well as a person. 
  It was not until the establishment of New China in 1949 that 
the world's most populous country achieved total elimination of 
drug abuse and trafficking as a result of a series of successful 
campaigns. 
  However, international drug rings using China as a transit 
route have led the resurgence of drug-related problems in the 
country in the past few years. Tons of heroin have been 
intercepted and thousands of traffickers of different 
nationalities arrested. 
  In the first quarter of this year alone, China cracked more 
than 4,900 narcotics-related cases, seizing 1,000 kilograms of 
heroin and 476 kilograms of opium. 
  The nation's horrendous experience with opium has made it 
the 
deadliest foe of narcotics, be it heroin, opium or marijuana. 
And the government's relentless stance on this score enjoys 
wide support of the people at large. 
  In the face of increasing drug trafficking and abuse, both 
central and provincial governments have stepped up the fight 
against such illegal activities. 
  The National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC), the top 
anti-drug agency, has vowed more than once to deal with the 
drug-related crimes most sternly. 
  Established in 1990, NNCC was reorganized recently. Headed 
by Tao Siju, Minister of Public Security, the high-powered 
commission is composed of 15 senior officials from ministries of 
Public Security, Civil Affairs, Justice, Finance, Foreign 
Affairs and the Customs as well as the military. The commission 
is in charge of stopping drug trafficking, curbing drug abuses 
and launching anti-narcotics publicity drives. 
  Local authorities, especially those in border areas, have 
also published drug-control regulations suited to local 
conditions to combat the crimes. Various campaigns have been 
launched to mobilize the public to join in the fight. 
  While imposing heavy punishments on narcotics criminals, 
including the death sentence, central and local governments have 
also carried out rehabilitation plans, which have weaned 
thousands of people off drug addiction. 
  To stop any loopholes, the central government has tightened 
control over chemicals that might be used to process drugs by 
decreeing that 32 substances cannot be exported without licence. 
  Drug abuse is becoming more and more an international issue 
which cannot be effectively curbed unless all nations join hands. 
  China has been active all along in the fight against 
narcotics. Its successful interceptions of cross-border drug 
trafficking have prevented tons of heroin and opium from being 
smuggled via China. 
  To wipe out the scourge of narcotics, however, calls for 
comprehensive international co-operation. The nations should 
exchange experiences and share information. 
  With concerted and unremitting efforts we will be sure to 
win 
this new Opium War.

1819 2448): "The Chinese Ambassador to Britain Says the Chinese 
Side Is Willing To Talk and Cooperate With the British Side on 
Issues Other Than Hong Kong's Constitutional Reform"] 
  [Text] London, 23 Jun -- When talking about recent 
Sino-British relations, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen 
said that the Chinese Government is willing to talk and 
cooperate with the British Government on issues other than Hong 
Kong's constitutional reform. This is a pragmatic approach. 
  Ma Yuzhen told reporters yesterday that the Chinese 
Government has taken account of Hong Kong's interests in 
adopting this pragmatic attitude on current Sino-British 
relations. 
  Both the Chinese and British sides clearly understand that 
it 
is impossible to hold talks again on Hong Kong's constitutional 
reform, Ma Yuzhen pointed out; but both sides are aware that 
there is still a need to cooperate on issues other than Hong 
Kong's constitutional reform, he added. 
  He cited as an example that Hong Kong's economy and its 
people's lives must not be ignored because the talks on Hong 
Kong's constitutional reform have failed. In addition, China 
and Britain must cooperate in international affairs and in their 
economic and trade relations. British Foreign Office Minister 
Alastair Goodlad will visit Beijing in July. This indicates 
both sides' wish for cooperation. 
  On the prospects for Sino-British trade, which has received 
attention in all circles, Ma Yuzhen said that the Chinese 
Government welcomes British businessmen's investments in China 
and hopes that British businessmen will have opportunities.

  [Text] Believe it or not, Sir Robin Mclaren is actually 
going to miss the hordes of young Hong Kong reporters gathered 
around the gates of his Beijing residence demanding a response 
to China's latest attack on British Government policy. The 
British Ambassador never looked particularly comfortable 
surrounded by young women brandishing microphones just 
centimetres from his nose but Sir Robin says he eventually 
became "very fond" of his interrogators. 
  "I have a lot of admiration for them, it is not an easy job, 
spending all that time outside the embassy trying to get me to 
say something," Sir Robin said, in the relatively tranquil 
surroundings of the palatial home he will vacate at the end of 
next month after three turbulent years as Her Majesty's 
ambassador to the People's Republic of China. 
  The sight of Sir Robin besieged by reporters will be perhaps 
one of the most lasting images of his tenure in Beijing, a time 
which saw Sino-British relations fall to their lowest point in 
decades and Sir Robin's health suffer noticeably as a result. 
After six months of fruitless negotiations on the political 
future of Hong Kong, he was forced to return to London for an 
operation on his back, which left him out of action for much of 
the winter. But despite all the tensions and frustrations of 
the last three years, Sir Robin says he has no regrets about 
taking up one of the most difficult jobs in the British Foreign 
Service. 
  "I was aware that the last few years of British rule in Hong 
Kong were likely to be difficult but even if I knew the precise 
nature of the problem that would not have affected my decision 
to come here," he said. "It is a job I have always wanted to 
do. My first posting after learning Chinese was in Beijing [in 
1960] and so it has been a natural aspiration for me to do the 
top job here." 
  Sir Robin said that he hoped to return to China as a private 
citizen after his retirement from the Foreign Office, and was 
looking for employment in a business which could keep him 
"engaged" with the mainland and Hong Kong, where he served as 
political adviser to the Governor from 1981 to 1985. "I have a 
personal interest in the culture and the way of life," he said. 
"I also have a great interest and affection for Hong Kong." 
  However, Sir Robin will not be offering his services to the 
British Government as an "elder statesman" or adviser on China 
policy. "We do not have the same system as in China and Japan, 
once you retire, you retire," he said. "I do not expect to 
offer advice or to be asked for advice. Yesterday's ambassador 
is the least qualified to give advice." 
  Asked if this meant he thinks his outspoken predecessor, Sir 
Percy Cradock, should refrain from his very public criticism of 
the government's current policy on Hong Kong and China, Sir 
Robin said: "I am not going to make any public comment on Sir 
Percy, who is a good friend and respected colleague." The only 
advice Sir Robin said he would give his successor, Len 
Appleyard, would be to stress the need for "patience and 
persistence" and "to respect but not to be cowed by the 
Chinese". Advice, he says he has "tried" to live up to himself, 
although he declined to say if he thought he had actually 
succeeded. 
  Sir Robin was rather more forthright in his comments on the 
Chinese Government and, in particular, the failure to reach an 
agreement on the arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 elections in 
Hong Kong. "There was insufficient willingness to compromise, 
especially on the Chinese side," he said. "They had determined 
that Governor (Chris) Patten's proposals violated the three 
principles (adherence to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings 
reached between the two sides) and they got caught up in their 
own rhetoric. 
  "It would not have been possible to reach an agreement 
unless 
we had done what the Chinese wanted and abandoned our position, 
but we would have then had to measure the Chinese proposals 
against the need for open and fair elections in Hong Kong. Even 
if we had done that, the proposals would still have to have been 
passed by Legco [the Legislative Council], something the Chinese 
did not understand." 
  Sir Robin said his biggest disappointment in the talks was 
his failure to convince the Chinese that Britain did not have 
any ulterior motive in pushing for greater democracy in Hong 
Kong and engaging in massive infrastructure projects, such as 
the new airport. "There was this suspicion and mistrust on the 
Chinese side that we wanted to run away with the money," he 
said. "That is not remotely true. Britain just wants the best 
for the people of Hong Kong." 
  The ambassador was quick to point out however that he did 
not 
consider his chief interlocutor in the Sino-British talks, Vice- 
Foreign Minister Jian Enzhu, to be naturally hostile or 
suspicious towards Britain. Mr Jiang, he said, was a "skilled 
and highly sophisticated diplomat," as was the director of the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, but the older 
leaders, who determine Hong Kong policy, had their "thoughts 
conditioned by the civil war, the anti-Japanese war, and the 
Korean War and that obviously affected their view of Britain in 
Hong Kong". 
  Nevertheless, Sir Robin expressed confidence that China 
would 
not attempt to mould Hong Kong in its own image after the 
handover in 1997; if anything, he said, the reverse would be 
true. 
  While Hong Kong has dominated his three years as ambassador, 
Sir Robin was also required to implement that famous quote from 
Prime Minister John Major in Beijing three years ago that the 
British Government would apply "unrelenting and unremitting" 
pressure on China's human rights. Unrelenting and unremitting 
pressure has never really been Sir Robin's style and while he 
claims Britain has a "close and strong interest" in China's 
human rights, nobody could say the ambassador has been ramming 
the subject down the throats of Chinese Government officials. 
  Imprisoned Ming Pao journalist, Xi Yang, was a case in point 
where Sir Robin raised the issue with the Chinese authorities 
but did not pursue the matter with quite the vigor that perhaps 
Mr Major's statement required of him. Sir Robin's hands were 
tied to a certain extent by the row over Hong Kong but, even in 
the best of circumstances, it is doubtful he would have taken a 
higher profile on human rights. 
  Instead, Sir Robin emphasises the achievements of British 
trade and industry in moving into the China market over the last 
three years, pointing out that Britain's exports to China 
increased by 72 percent last year over 1992 but ignoring the 
fact that Britain still had a 587 million Pound (about HK$6.9 
billion) trade deficit with the mainland at the end of 1993. 
  In all, Sir Robin may not have a lot to shout about as he 
leaves Beijing but at least the storm over Hong Kong's political 
future has subsided for a while, giving the outgoing ambassador 
hope that when Britain finally relinquishes control of the 
territory on June 30, 1997, the handover will be done in "an 
atmosphere of cooperation and not recrimination".

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Zeneca Group of 
Britain recently signed an agreement with China's Pharmaceutical 
Import and Export Corporation (Sino-Pharm) to launch a 
pharmaceutical consulting company in Beijing. 
  The group also reached another accord with the Chinese firm 
to set up an agro-chemicals plant, with a total investment of 60 
million U.S. dollars. 
  David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, which was listed in 
1993, said in an interview with XINHUA that the establishment of 
the pharmaceutical consulting company was Zeneca's first step to 
expand its China business. 
  Zeneca expected to invest more than 100 million U.S. dollars 
in various projects in China in the next five years, he said. 
  "Through the company, Zeneca will introduce its advanced 
technology and products to China, and help the pharmaceutical 
circles of China to increase exchanges and contacts with the 
outside world," Barnes added. 
  Zeneca's turnover in China in 1993 reached 44 million 
dollars, of which medicines and specially-made chemicals each 
supplied a quarter, and agro-chemicals products 50 percent. 
  Barnes also said that the agrochemicals joint-venture, which 
would go into operation in 1996, was the third largest 
investment in China by an external agrochemicals producer for 
the manufacture of an active ingredient of herbicide. 
  "The progress being made on these two projects demonstrates 
our commitment to developing our business in China," Barnes 
said. "We are confident that our business here can grow and 
make an increasing contribution to the burgeoning economic 
prosperity of the country."

<F P=106> [By Xie Songxin: "Germans Set Sights On Growth"] </F>
  [Text] German construction giant Philipp Holzmann is 
targeting Chinese infrastructural and real estate projects after 
solidifying its development in the former East Germany. 
  "As we've consolidated ourselves in the united German 
market, 
we are expanding quickly to foreign countries, with the primary 
focus on China where demand for infrastructure is large," said 
Lothar Mayer chairman of the board of Holzmann. 
  The company has invested heavily in highrises, industrial 
construction, hotels, highways, railways and environmental 
protection projects in Berlin and other areas of the former East 
Germany since the unification of Germany in 1989. 
  "Infrastructure and highrises are our priorities in China," 
said Gerhard Logters, member of the board. 
  Mayer, Logters and other senior executives were in Beijing 
last week to boost Holzmann's image and consolidate its business 
in China. 
  China accounts for half of the firm's business in the Asia- 
Pacific region. 
  With millions of dollars of contracts in hand, Holzmann is 
targeting several urban construction and infrastructure projects 
in China including highways and harbours. 
  It is one of the foreign companies competing for tunnelling 
work in the proposed 18.1-kilometre Guangzhou subway. The 
subway is expected to cost 6 billion yuan ($689 million). 
Foreign firms will be allowed to dig two tunnels for the subway. 
  Bidding on the tunnelling portion of the contract are 
companies from Japan, South Korea and Europe. 
  Jurgen Lindemann, director of Holzmann's Overseas 
Department, 
claims that his company has a good chance of winning the 
contract because of the company's technology, its experience in 
other parts of the world, its 15 years experience in working 
with Chinese partners and its overall knowledge of the market. 
  In another development, it is announced that Holzmann will 
develop an office and apartment centre in Beijing. It has 
already signed a letter of intent with the Beijing government. 
  Located in the eastern suburb of the city, the site will 
occupy 53,000 square metres. Logters estimates that the project 
could cost 300 million German marks ($187.5 million) and take 
three years to build. 
  The project, which is being undertaken with the Beijing 
Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Corporation, will be the 
second development Holzmann has been awarded in the capital 
city. The first one was the Beijing Lufthansa Centre, which is 
a complex including a hotel, office building, apartments and 
major shopping centre. 
  At present, Holzmann is building two power plants: One is in 
Ertan, Sichuan Province; the other in Xiaolangdi, Henan 
Province. Both projects are funded by World Bank loans. It is 
also constructing an elevated highway in downtown Shanghai. 
  Apart from infrastructure, Holzmann and its subsidiaries are 
seeking investment in China in building materials, environmental 
protection and industrial sectors.

  [Text] Lisbon, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Foreign 
Affairs Minister Durao Barroso pointed out in Lisbon on 21 June: 
Portugal and China are comprehensively developing friendly and 
cooperative relations in the political, economic, and cultural 
fields. 
  While meeting and feting outgoing Chinese Ambassador to 
Portugal Wu Tao, Foreign Minister Barroso said: After 
establishing diplomatic relations in 1979, particularly after 
the Portuguese and Chinese Governments signed a joint communique 
on the Macao issue in 1987, the two countries have been 
enhancing bilateral relations in an all-around manner. 
  Barroso said: Portugal and China have different national 
conditions and systems. However, their ways of resolving 
problems left over by history and of handling relations between 
the two countries can be termed exemplary. He expressed the 
hope that Portugal and China will further enhance bilateral 
relations and will continually make contributions to advancing 
the common interests of the Portuguese and Chinese people and to 
facilitating global peace and prosperity. 
  The Portuguese foreign minister also pointed out: At 
present, the Portuguese and Chinese Governments are making joint 
efforts to facilitate a smooth transfer of Macao. Macao has 
become a link for the two countries to enhance bilateral 
relations. Portugal and China will still continue to maintain 
friendly relations for generations after 1999.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by Rong Song: "Only Those Without Human Nature </F>
Plant Bombs"] 
  [Text] Tehran, June 24 (XINHUA) -- "Only those people who 
have no human nature planted bombs in holy places like the 
shrine of Imam Reza" in the time of Ashura when people were 
commemorating the fourth Shi'ite Imam Hussein, a pilgrim told 
XINHUA Thursday [23 June] in Mashhad. 
  A group of foreign correspondents visited Mashhad Thursday 
and Friday at the invitation of the Iranian Ministry of Culture 
and Islamic Guidance, however, non-Moslem correspondents were 
rejected entry to the shrine to see the bombing spot. 
  A bomb exploded Monday inside the shrine of Imam Reza, 
killing 24 people and injuring more than 100 others. 
  In Qha'em hospital, Ahmad Amir Dervari, a worker of the 
hospital, said that no one could imagine that a bomb exploded in 
the holiest place of the shrine of Imam Reza. 
  Telling correspondents that his legs were wounded by broken 
glasses and the bomb fire and his right ear deafened by the bomb 
sound, Dervari said he did not believe that it was a bomb at 
first but thought it was something dropping from the ceiling of 
the shrine. 
  "When other people told me a bomb exploded I found I could 
not breathe," Dervari said. "I crawled to the door and was 
rescued by the people outside." 
  Mohammad Reza Mahdavian told correspondents tearfully that 
when he heard the explosion he felt that his back was burned and 
after touching his back he found his backing was bleeding. 
  He said he was lucky because the bomb was planted some 
distance away from him and urged the foreign correspondents to 
tell the world that the Iranian people are not afraid of dying. 
  "Only the MKO (Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization) and the 
enemies of Islam can do such things," he said. "They want to 
root out Islam." 
  Davud Ariyannejad, 20-years-old middle school student, was 
burned totally from head to toe and his right eye was blinded by 
the bomb. 
  He was only one meter away from the bomb, he said, adding 
that he went the shrine to pray with one of his classmates and 
his classmate was also injured and hospitalized in another 
hospital. 
  In Imam Reza Hospital, a 14-year-old boy showed foreign 
correspondents the wound in his stomach, saying that he and his 
cousin were praying in the shrine when the bomb exploded and 
after three hours his parents got the news that he was wounded 
in the explosion. 
  Ghasemian, a 54-year-old worker from Iran's northwestern 
city 
of Tabriz, said that he came to the shrine with his family, his 
7-year- old daughter was killed and his left leg was cut off in 
the explosion. 
  Doctors in the hospital told correspondents that his another 
son was also killed in the explosion and four members of his 
family were injured in the bomb blast. 
  A doctor said that 25 people were hospitalized in his 
section 
after the explosion and many others left the hospital after the 
treatment of their minor injures. 
  In a press conference Thursday night, Ayatollah Abbas Vaez 
Tabassi, the custodian of the shrine of Imam Reza, said that 24 
people were killed and 120-130 others wounded in the explosion, 
adding that the figure of the wounded may be even higher. 
  It is difficult to count because some people left after 
treatment of minor injuries at hospital, the representative of 
Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i said. 
  He denied any involvement of Sunni people in the bomb blast, 
saying that it was the MKO members that engineered and carried 
out the preplanned explosion. 
  The Iranian authorities have undeniable evidence that the 
explosion was carried by the MKO members, he said, the evidence 
will be announced to the public.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 26 (XINHUA) -- Myanmar 
[Burma] Home Minister Mya Thin said here today that his country 
is making efforts to put an end to the danger of narcotic drugs 
abuse as soon as possible. 
  The remark was made by Lieutenant-General Mya Thin, Myanmar 
minister for home affairs and chairman of the Central Committee 
for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), in his speech at a ceremony of 
the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit 
Trafficking, which was held here today. 
  Mya Thin stressed in his speech that illicit poppy 
cultivation is related to the existence of armed groups, and an 
end to the armed groups will pave the way for eliminating the 
poppy cultivation and production of opium. 
  Since the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(SLORC) took the power of state in 1988, 11 anti-government 
ethnic armed groups have returned to the legal fold in Myanmar 
and the government is making efforts to hold peace talks with 
the remaining anti-government armed groups. 
  However, the government will never make peace negotiations 
with Khun Sa, who is a drug warlord in the notorious Golden 
Triangle region where Laos, Myanmar and Thailand meet, local 
sources said. 
  It is learnt that Yangon has been amassing government troops 
to fight Khun Sa and has decided to eliminate the Khun Sa's 
armed forces in the near future. 
  The government has not disclosed yet the details of the 
battles against Khun Sa's armed forces. 
  The "Golden Triangle" is the region from where a huge amount 
of opium and heroin is produced in the world. 
  According to official figures today, over 1,470 kilos of 
heroin and over 11,800 kilos of opium were seized from 1988 to 
May 31, 1994 in Myanmar and over 3,300 hectares of poppy fields 
and 28 opium refineries were destroyed from 1990 to 1994 in the 
country. 
  The narcotic drugs law was promulgated in 1974 and the 
Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) was formed in 
1975 in Myanmar. 
  After Myanmar became a signatory to the United Nations 
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psycho 
Tropic Substances in 1991, the new law on drug control was 
enacted in Myanmar in 1993. 
  In order to eliminate the drug abuse and illicit 
trafficking, 
Myanmar has made a program for development of border areas and 
national races and nearly two billion kyats (about 300 million 
U.S. dollars) has been spent since 1989. 
  Myanmar paid attention to international cooperations on drug 
control and Myanmar, China, Laos, Thailand and the United 
Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) signed a memorandum of 
understanding to control illicit drug trafficking and abuse in 
New York in 1993. 
  Similarly, the first ministerial level meeting among Laos, 
Myanmar and Thailand was held in Bangkok in February, 1992, and 
the second meeting in Yangon in February, 1994.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] According to our correspondent in Moscow, on 8-17 
June, the Vietnamese prime minister visited Ukraine, Kazakhstan, 
and Russia. This is the first time the head of the Vietnamese 
Government has paid an official visit to the CIS states since 
the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. 
  For historical reasons, Vietnam economy had close relations 
with the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries. 
Annual import value of Vietnam from the former Soviet Union 
reached over $1 billion. After the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, Hanoi quickly established relations with the CIS 
community to maintain the traditional economic cooperation. 
Since then some important changes have taken place, and the 
reality has forced Vietnamese leaders to adjust their external 
relations. In addition to actively seeking cooperation from its 
neighbor countries in the region to invest in Vietnam, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet also visited a number of Western European 
countries last year, thus obtaining significant economic benefit 
to Vietnam, leading to the cooperation between Vietnam and the 
European community. 
  In the meantime, the situation of relations between Vietnam 
and Russia and other CIS countries was not as good as expected. 
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 
Vietnamese-Russian relations experienced a cold period. In 
1993, the two sides began to resume bilateral economic and trade 
relations but only to an insignificant extent. The total trade 
turnover in the year was only $300 million. In addition to over 
10 major projects that originated in the Soviet era, there were 
no new projects set up in the last two or three years. The 
joint venture enterprises between Vietnam and Russia and other 
CIS states are basically small factories. 
  Development of cooperative relations with Russia, Ukraine, 
and Kazakhstan, the three developed industrialized states in the 
CIS community, is not only important to the development of 
Vietnam, but it is also the starting point for the development 
of cooperative relations with other states in the CIS community. 
Both Vietnamese leaders and the public, therefore, highly 
regarded the recent visit to the CIS states by Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet. 
  Because of a number of concrete difficulties, both Hanoi and 
Kiev this time expressed wishes to step up cooperative 
relations. If flowers blossom in the spring, then the fruit will 
come in the autumn. It is just natural that the people put 
their hope in the visit this time of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  In Kazakhstan, both sides hoped for beneficial cooperation 
in 
agriculture, oil and gas, mining, and light industry. The visit 
to Russia was certainly the most important leg of the visit to 
the three states by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Summing up the 
visit, Russian public opinion maintains that the visit and the 
meetings of the leaders brought the Vietnamese-Russian relations 
to an important period. But the Russian-Vietnamese friendship 
treaty has also left a profound impression. We could say that 
the purpose of the Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit is to 
reaffirm the basic conceptions of bilateral relations or to 
adjust the regrettable cold relations in the last several years. 
The Russian-Vietnamese basic friendship treaty replaces the 
Soviet-Vietnamese treaty signed in 1978, which announced the 
termination of the association between the two countries formed 
in special historical conditions. The new treaty stipulates 
that the two countries carry out negotiations only in cases of 
crisis, and this is likely to be the foundation for relations in 
the future. It is only natural that when the circumstances 
change the foundation should change, too. However, with a new 
foundation, many issues in the relations must also be reviewed. 
For example, the discrepancies between the two sides in 
bilateral and international issues include repayment of debts 
that Vietnam had with the former Soviet Union, the lease of Cam 
Ranh Bay of Vietnam to Russia, and so forth. If these issues 
are openly discussed, people may be anxious about whether a 
basic treaty could be signed. 
  Due to many urgent public engagements, President Yeltsin 
could not hold a meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as 
previously planned, and the two sides agreed to cancel it, but 
the visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet was not wasted. Besides 
the Russian-Vietnamese friendship treaty, the two sides also 
signed bilateral cooperation agreements, such as the agreement 
on encouragement and protection of investment. Both Moscow and 
Hanoi believe that they have the necessary potential to carry 
out favorable cooperation in the fields of politics, foreign 
trade, science and technology, and so forth. Vietnam, Russia, 
Ukraine, and Kazakhstan are all seeking new roads for economic 
development. The development of mutually beneficial cooperation 
should be their common demand and aspiration. Though they still 
face some difficulties, good results will eventually come.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition 
and the opposition agreed tonight to convene a plenary session 
of the House of Representatives early tommorrow morning to vote 
on a no-confidence motion against the minority government of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported. 
  According to party officials, they reached the agreement at 
a 
meeting of directors of the lower house's steering committee. 
  If Hata fails to survive the no-confidence motion introduced 
by the leading opposition liberal party, he must either resign 
with his entire cabinet or dissolve the lower house for a snap 
election. 
  Talks between leaders of the ruling coalition and the second 
largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] are now under way, but 
prospects seem to be dim for an agreement on a future 
re-alliance. 
  If the coalition's efforts fail to entice the SDP back into 
the governing camp, the SDP may support the no-confidence 
motion, which means it would be readily approved in the lower 
chamber. 
  The SDP and the ruling coalition remain at odds over the 
resignation of Hata and the formation of a new government. 
  The ruling coalition has rejected demands from the SDP that 
Hata and his cabinet resign en masse, the principle condition 
set by the SDP for returning to the fold.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 (XINHUA) -- The two-month-old 
minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata resigned en 
masse today in a bid to break the current impasse in the 
volatile, unpredicatable Japanese politics. 
  At a hastily-called press conference, the 58-year-old prime 
minister said that he would quit together with his ministers. 
  Hata announced the cabinet resignation just hours before the 
House of Representatives was to convene a plenary session to 
vote on a no-confidence motion tabled by the leading opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The Hata administration was 
believed almost certain to lose the vote. 
  He said the decision aims to avoid a "political vacuum" at a 
time when Japan faces a host of domestic and international 
challenges. 
  "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will 
entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the 
Diet (parliament)," Hata told the press conference. 
  "If the House of Representatives is dissolved, there will be 
a political vacuum in the nation and therefore dealing with the 
yen's rise and other issues will become impossible," he said. 
"I want to avoid a political vacuum by every means." 
  Ruling coalition leaders, in making the decision to disband 
the cabinet at a meeting earlier in the day, agreed to allow the 
two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), to create a new coalition government. 
  Coalition and SDP leaders failed to iron out their 
differences in the past two days of on-and-off talks on the 
socialists' rejoining the governing bloc. 
  Coalition leaders rejected the SDP's demand that the Hata 
cabinet voluntarily resign, and instead opted to face the 
no-confidence motion. 
  Last night, sentiment emerged within the ruling camp that 
Hata should dissolve the lower house if the motion was passed, 
and Hata himself reportedly hinted at his readiness to do so. 
  Under Japan's constitutional rules, the prime minister 
should 
either disband his cabinet or dissolve the lower house for a 
snap election within 10 days after a no-confidence motion 
against him clears the Diet. 
  But the situation changed overnight when the ruling 
coalition 
decided to meet the SDP's demand. The development left Japan 
watchers here with feelings that Japanese politics is really a 
changeable, unpredictable, and sometimes mysterious world. 
  The Hata government was formed on April 28 after its 
predecessor, headed by Japan New Party leader Morihiro Hosokawa, 
collapsed in a protracted row over Hosokawa's alleged financial 
improprieties. 
  The SDP was the largest contingent in the Hosokawa coalition 
which was formed after last July's general election that toppled 
the LDP after its 38 years of uninterrupted rule. 
  But the socialists walked out of the ruling bloc after the 
formation within the coalition of the parliamentary group, 
Kaishin, which excluded the SDP.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- The Japanese 
Government is giving a million U.S. dollars worth of urgent aid 
to help south China's six provinces suffering from the effects 
of flood disasters. 
  Koichi Matsumoto, charge d'affaires ad interim of the 
Japanese Embassy in Beijing, announced his government's decision 
to give the emergency aid when he met here today with Long 
Yongtu, Chinese assistant minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  The aid will include 800,000 U.S. dollars, and 100 small 
generators worth 200,000 U.S. dollars. 
  Matsumoto said that the Japanese Government made the 
decision 
out of humanitarian considerations, since the scale of the 
disaster was very large, and Japan-China ties are very good. 
  In the past two weeks, rainstorms and floods have hit 
southern China's provinces of Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, 
Zhejiang and Fujian as well as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region.

  [Text] Shanghai, June 25 (XINHUA) -- A direct shipping line 
between Shanghai and Nagasaki in Japan was fully restored today 
after a suspension of 52 years. 
  The return here today of the vessel "Haihua" from a six-day 
round trip to Nagasaki completed the first direct sea link 
between the two cities since 1942. 
  Nagasaki, only 462 miles away, is the nearest Japanese sea 
port for Shanghai. There used to be a shipping line between the 
two cities. It was suspended in 1942. 
  In order to promote exchanges between the two port cities, 
Nagasaki County government proposed in 1988 to resume the 
shipping line. Through efforts by both of governmental and 
non-governmental organizations of the two cities, the shipping 
line was finally opened. 
  Yang Zhengding, general manager of the Shanghai-Nagasaki 
INternational Ferry Co. Ltd., said that the reopening of the 
route reflects the common will of the people in the two cities 
and the needs of economic development of the two cities.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 26 (XINHUA) -- A loudspeaker truck 
driven by a member of an illegal ultra-rightist group hit the 
front door of the office building of the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper 
in Osaka on Saturday [25 June], causing no casualty, local media 
reported today. 
  The truck smashed the windows of the front door of the 
building after hitting it twice. The driver, a member of a 
local illegal ultra-rightist group, was arrested by police for 
"object destruction offenses." 
  A lot of Japanese ultra-rightist groups, including the one 
involved this time, are connected with organized criminal groups 
and other violence groups. 
  This is the fourth time for ASAHI SHIMBUN to be attacked by 
ultra-rightist groups since April 1, when two of its staff 
members were taken hostage by members of a Tokyo ultra-rightist 
group in the newspaper's headquarters in Tokyo. 
  On April 21, the newspaper's Osaka office building was 
attacked by an ultra-rightist loudspeaker truck smashing its way 
into the building. 
  On April 25, the building was attacked with firebombs by 
ultra-rights.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 (XINHUA) -- A Japanese Government 
commission today approved a long-term program on plutonium use 
which prevents its manufacturing and possession in a greater 
amount than needed for its nuclear power generation. 
  The Atomic Energy Commission, headed by State Minister for 
Science and Technology Mikio Omi, said Japan will cut back the 
schedule of its fast-breeder reactor program by as much as 10 
years. 
  Fast-breeder reactors, which other countries have abandoned 
as unfeasible and impractical, run on plutonium and generate 
more plutonium in the process. Conventional nuclear reactors 
are fueled by U-235 or U-238 rods. 
  In the seventh revision to Japan's long-term nuclear 
development plan since 1956, the commission said the 
rescheduling was to prevent over-accumulation of plutonium. 
  The revised plan, outlining Japan's nuclear development 
targets up to 2010, also put a halt to the country's efforts at 
reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. 
  The report said uranium, once assumed to be in short supply, 
is readily available internationally. It also noted growing 
concern over nuclear proliferation. 
  The report called for the need to build two demonstration 
fast- breeder reactors -- the first of which would be built in 
the early 21st century, rather than the late 1990s with 
demonstration reactors operational by around 2030, instead of 
the original goal of 2020 to 2030. 
  The government report said that apart from its compliance in 
observing safeguards obligations which involves accepting 
regular, unimpeded, checks by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency monitors, Japan will never exchange nuclear technologies 
with countries other than Britain, France, Germany and the 
United States to prevent nuclear arms proliferation. 
  It also called for steps to prevent diverting refined 
plutonium for military use. 
  However, Japan will not scrap its basic nuclear policy of 
relying on a nuclear fuel cycle for its future-electricity 
needs, the report said. 
  The nuclear fuel cycle refers to the use of plutonium for 
electricity-generation extracted from spent fuel rods downloaded 
from a nuclear reactor that is energized by enriched uranium.

  [Text] Athens, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said here today that the Russian-EU partnership 
agreement is of "historic importance" and represents the first 
step of Russia's economic comeback to Europe. 
  Speaking after signing the pact at the European Union 
summit, 
Yeltsin said the agreement marks the end of ideological and 
economic conflicts that prevailed during the Cold War era. 
  "We all felt the symptoms of an economic Cold War, but this 
threat is being abolished with this agreement," said Yeltsin. 
"Today, Russia becomes a significant partner of the Europeans, 
and we will do everything possible to support European 
integration." 
  He added that Moscow would back efforts aimed at enlarging 
the 12-nation bloc, which will extend formal membership to four 
countries later today.

  [Text] Moscow, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin returned to Moscow Saturday [25 June] night from Greece, 
where he signed a "historic" agreement on partnership and 
cooperation with the European Union (EU). 
  The Russian president left Moscow for Greece on Thursday 
morning to take part in the meeting of the heads of state and 
government of the member countries of the EU held on the island 
of Corfu. 
  He signed the agreement on Friday and described it as a 
"historic document." 
  The 80-page document is expected to boost trade and 
investment between Russia and EU countries. 
  "The document of great historic importance clearly defines 
the conditions and stages of Russia's return to the economic 
Europe as an equal partner," said Yeltsin. 
  He stressed that the agreement is yet another step towards 
building a united Europe. 
  On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed 
a Partnership for Peace program in Brussels with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Tiegang: "Russia Speeds Up Drive To Join </F>
West"] 
  [Text] Moscow, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Russia, the major 
successor and heir to the old Soviet Union bloc has, after 18 
months of bargaining, accomplished part of its plan towards 
uniting with the West. 
  On Friday [24 June], on the Greek Island of Corfu, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin signed an historic agreement with the 
European Union (EU), two days after his Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev signed the Partnership for Peace Program with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels. 
  The dual moves give renewed impetus to Moscow's drive to end 
years of isolation from the West which it had experienced during 
the Soviet-era, marking delicate changes in the Kremlin's 
foreign policy. 
  Failing to gain expected benefits in efforts to improve ties 
with the West in 1992 and 1993, Moscow had been focusing on the 
relations with its neighboring countries especially the former 
Soviet republics at the beginning of the year. 
  But in recent months it again turned its attention to 
relations with the West after thinking over its long-term 
political, military and economic strategies. 
  Before leaving Moscow on Thursday, Yeltsin told reporters 
that the new accord, which strengthened political, economic and 
trade ties with the European Union, was a first tactical step. 
"When Russia really enters Europe, becomes a European country 
then it can only gain from this," he pointed out. 
  The 10-year partnership and cooperation agreement that 
Yeltsin signed with the EU sets the seal on economic cooperation 
after more than 18 months of negotiations. 
  Moscow has frequently protested against what it calls 
discriminatory trade barriers erected by Western nations, saying 
Russia needs to be allowed to sell its products more than it 
needs Western aid. 
  Now, the accord lifts trade barriers, offers greater 
certainty to traders and investors, and opens the prospect of a 
free-trade zone after 1998. It confirms the removal of all 
quotas on Russian exports to the EU apart from certain textile 
and steel products. But it also allows Russia to impose 
temporary quotas on limited amounts of EU imports. 
  The agreement established regular political contacts at all 
levels, from heads of government to officials. It also supports 
Russia's future access to the GATT (the General Agreement on 
Tariffs And Trade) and the World Trade Organization, scheduled 
to replace GATT next year. 
  The accord will take effect after it has been ratified by 
the 
parliaments of Russia and EU member states and the European 
Parliament. 
  A cooperation protocol, put forward by Moscow as a 
precondition for joining the Partnership for Peace Program and 
signed together with the accord, acknowledges Russia's major 
power status and its influence in Europe, declaring that Russia 
and NATO will have extensive dialogue and cooperation and 
conduct political consultations on European global security and 
peacekeeping missions. 
  The revitalized drive toward improved relations with the 
West 
was also on display across the Atlantic with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin scheduled to meet with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  On Wednesday, the Russian premier signed a 
multibillion-dollar energy agreement with international oil 
companies and secured another 820 million U.s dollars in World 
Bank loans. 
  Moreover, Yeltsin is scheduled to attend the Group of Seven 
summit of leaders of the leading industrialized nations in 
Naples, Italy, next month. Russia has been gaining support in 
its efforts to become a formal member of the group. 
  The Russian president is also scheduled to have a second 
summit meeting with Clinton within nine months in Washington in 
September. 
  Outlining Russia's purpose in its drive to join the West, 
Yeltsin stressed on arrival in Corfu: "We move forward as equal 
partners toward our mutual interests."

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhang Tiegang] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, June 24 (XINHUA) -- For ten days there has 
been heated debate in the kremlin over whether President Boris 
Yeltsin's decree to fight organized crime is timely or legal. 
  On June 14, the president decreed urgent measures to fight 
organized crime, triggering the debates which are ongoing. 
  According to official statistics, about 5,600 organized 
criminal groups, or mafia, exist in Russia, while the crime rate 
has doubled over the past five years. 
  During the first five months of this year, a total of 
1,094,000 crimes were reported, including 30,000 murders, 67,000 
severe physical injuries, and more than 200,000 robberies and 
thefts. 
  "Crime has already penetrated the centers of power and is 
taking them over, extending its control over property, the 
economy, the market and politics," warned Sergei Stepashin, 
director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
  The presidential decree gives law enforcement agencies 
sweeping powers to detain suspects for up to 30 days and examine 
the financial affairs of anyone suspected of engaging in 
organized crime. 
  Under the decree, police and federal troops have the right 
to 
search offices and homes without a court order. However, the 
human rights group 'Memorial' criticized the policy for 
"sacrificing the principles of law and democracy." 
  The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, called on 
Yeltsin Wednesday to halt his decree while accusing him of 
violating the constitution. 
  On the same day, the lower chamber passed a resolution by a 
vote of 279 to 10 with five abstentions, charging Yeltsin with 
"restricting the constitutional rights and citizens' freedom 
without sufficient basis." But Yeltsin stood firm by his 
order, although he is well aware there may be some questions 
about human rights violations contained in the decree, according 
to his press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  However, First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov, a 
supporter of the decree, made a gesture of compromise by 
announcing "we will not detain anyone without the sanction of 
the prosecutor's office." 
  Defending the police's right to detain suspects for up to 30 
days without charge, Yegorov stressed that it was very hard to 
pin charges on sophisticated gangsters within 48 hours as 
required by the law. 
  This issue has also divided the upper chamber, which met 
Thursday but failed to work out formal stand on the issue. Some 
deputies criticized the presidential decree for ignoring civil 
rights, while others called on the upper house to support 
Yeltsin. 
  As the debate continued, police attempted to carry out a 
massive raid against organized crime in Moscow earlier this week 
with little success, it turned out, when a radio report revealed 
the secret operation.

  [Text] Minsk, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Belarusian Foreign 
Minister Petr Kuzmich Kravchanka, said today that his country 
hopes to open direct trade with China following the success of 
diplomatic ties. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Kravchanka said that it was 
very 
important for Belarus to further promote its relations with 
China. 
  He said his government was grateful for China's support 
particularly over its backing of the question of Minsk's joining 
the UN Security Council. 
  "We hope our bilateral relations will always be filled with 
constructiveness and the spirit of mutual understanding and 
benefit," said the Belarusian foreign minister. 
  Speaking of Belarusian-Chinese economic and trade 
cooperation, Kravchanka noted that Belarus' trucks and tractors 
sold well on the Chinese market, and its military and space 
technology are very advanced, on a par with the rest of the 
world. 
  Meanwhile, Chinese garments and other commodities were 
welcomed by Belarusian consumers and the minister said that the 
two countries should raise their existing barter trade to the 
level of trading by foreign currency. 
  On Belarus' relations with Russia and western countries, 
Kravchanka said about 70 percent of Belarus' industrial products 
are sold to Russia, while the latter provided Minsk with 96 
percent of its energy. 
  It's necessary for Belarus to establish an economic alliance 
with Russia, "and we are going to restore economic ties with the 
east," said the minister. 
  "However, such links are built on the basis of market 
relations, instead of on the old mandatory orders and state 
planning model" he stressed. 
  He said conditions will become ripe for Belarus to develop 
ties with Western countries as the market relations between 
Belarus and Eastern states progress steadily and grow better. 
  The foreign minister added that Belarus pursues a neutral 
position in international affairs and maintains itself as a 
nuclear-free state.

  [Text] United Nations, June 24 (XINHUA) -- The Group of 77, 
the largest organization of developing countries, marked the 
30th anniversary of its establishment at a special ministerial 
meeting here today. 
  The group enlarged its membership to 130 today by admitting 
South Africa as a new member. 
  Created on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries, the 
group has played a cardinal role in international economic 
relations, calling for the establishment of a new international 
economic order, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests 
of developing countries, and working as a major actor in 
promoting development and international economic cooperation. 
  Presiding over the meeting, Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed 
Salah Dembri, who is chairman of the Group of 77, said the group 
faced the challenge of further strengthening its role, so that, 
30 years after its founding, its common ideals might live on and 
the complementary interests of all the members might be 
effectively promoted. 
  The group should maintain its cohesion, broaden its horizon 
and reaffirm its originality, specificity and independence, he 
said. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali praised the group's 
efforts for developing countries to gain independence and 
promote development. 
  "Long indeed has been the road traveled by this group toward 
what is today the underpinning of United Nations action for 
development," he said. 
  UN General Assembly President S.R. Insanally congratulated 
the group on its "splendid record of achievement" and said he 
believed the group, through their collective efforts, would 
"continue to make progress toward the goal of full development 
for all peoples." 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng sent a telegram to the special 
meeting, extending China's warm congratulations to the group and 
pledging that China stands "ready to work with the Group of 77 
for a gradual reform of the international economic order and for 
the common development and prosperity of developing countries." 
  China's permanent representative to the UN Li Zhaoxing told 
the meeting that China has decided to contribute 10,000 U.S. 
dollars to the group. 
  At today's meeting, representatives from the group's member 
states reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening south-south 
cooperation, called for renewing the dialogue between the north 
and the south, and urged developed countries to implement their 
commitments to international economic cooperation, providing 
developing countries with financial and technological support. 
  The meeting adopted a ministerial declaration which put 
forward a new strategy of action of developing countries for the 
year 2000 and beyond in light of the current world situation, 
and a ministerial statement on "an agenda for development." 
  It also adopted terms of reference of the joint coordinating 
committee between the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, 
another grouping of developing countries.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China is hoping for a 
"package plan" to resume its signatory status in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in the forthcoming 17th 
working group conference and the talks to be held within this 
year. 
  This was stated by Long Yongtu, assistant minister of 
foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, in an exclusive interview with 
XINHUA today. 
  Long is leaving for Geneva tomorrow together with the 
Chinese 
mission to the 17th working group conference of GATT, headed by 
Gu Yongjiang, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  China attaches great importance to the 17th conference, 
hoping to conduct wide-ranging consultations with other parties 
on the "comprehensive file" governing China's resumption of its 
signatory status in GATT. The file, prepared by the chairman of 
the China group of GATT, has been distributed to other parties 
for consideration. 
  "It is the first time in China's talks with GATT on its 
status over the past eight years that a file on China has been 
submitted to the conference by the chairman which contains the 
contents of multilateral protocols," Long said. "This 
represents an important step forward towards the resumption of 
China's signatory status," he added. 
  Included in the comprehensive file is the gist of the 
separate protocols submitted by the United States, Japan, the 
European Community and other signatory parties. China had 
separate bilateral consultations with the United States, Japan 
and the European Community before they submitted these protocols. 
  However, Long noted, China should by no means 
"underestimate" 
the difficulties it might face in the coming talks. 
  China is still a developing country, Long said. Thus, in 
balancing China's "rights and obligations" in realizing its 
resumption of status in GATT, the relevant parties should take 
into full account its practical conditions of economic 
development, its ongoing domestic economic reform process and 
the capability of the country as a whole to cope with the 
required conditions, Long stressed. 
  China's efforts to resume its signatory status reflect 
"mutual needs," Long said. "China needs the world trade 
organization, but the organization without China would be 
incomplete and less universal," he added. 
  To exclude China, one of the world's biggest countries, from 
the organization "would itself be unfair," Long concluded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Situation on the Korean Peninsula Is </F>
Easing"] 
  [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula is easing 
after former U.S. President Carter's mediation in Pyongyang. 
The heads of state of North and South Korea are ready to hold a 
historic summit meeting. A preparatory meeting for this summit 
will be held in the cease-fire village, Panmunjom, on 28 June. 
  The United States has relaxed its tone, saying that if the 
DPRK is willing to freeze its nuclear program and accept the 
relevant conditions on nuclear transparency, sanctions will be 
suspended. 
  Why could Clinton not make the situation develop toward 
relaxation in the previous period? But when Carter proceeded 
with mediatory work, the situation began to "brighten." Some 
people said that Clinton was pretending to be harsh, whereas 
Carter was pretending to be honest; they were cooperating with 
each other and using both hard and soft tactics; as a result, 
the situation changed for the better. 
  But other people said that this exactly portrays a decline 
in 
U.S. strength. Unaware of the actual strength of the U.S., 
Clinton sent out a high-pitched action signal, but he could not 
implement it. Therefore, Carter went to Pyongyang for an 
informal visit, during which results were achieved. Clinton 
immediately said that "there are indications of hope" and 
acknowledged that a summit meeting between North and South Korea 
will be a constructive breakthrough. 
  Clinton's miscalculation resulted from his prolonged idea 
that the United States was powerful; he thought that if the 
United States meted out "sanctions," a small country would 
knuckle under, obey orders, and be willing to be dominated by 
hegemonism. But even small countries like Somalia and Haiti 
have rendered the United States at its wit's end and put it in 
an awkward situation. The U.S. hard-line attitude on the Korean 
peninsula has pushed it into a blind alley. Imposing pressure 
cannot necessarily resolve problems, whereas talks are the way 
to improve understanding and dispel misunderstanding. 
  A U.S. internal analysis of Clinton's sanctions program 
against the DPRK indicates that the United States is at a 
disadvantage and that there is too much risk involved. 1) The 
United States is making all-out efforts to pursue a foreign 
policy of participating in Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, 
but sanctions will cause confrontation and a tense situation in 
the Asia-Pacific region. This is unfavorable to Asia-Pacific 
economic development and will be resisted by Asia-Pacific 
countries; sanctions cannot last long and could ruin U.S. 
strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region if implemented by 
force. 2) U.S. sanctions may force the DPRK to adopt a stronger 
attitude or withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty; 
in such a case, it will be difficult for the United States to 
carry out nuclear inspection in the DPRK. A confrontation 
between the United States and the DPRK could finally lead to 
U.S. involvement in a war. 3) If force is used, the United 
States will suffer casualties. Waging a war abroad will trigger 
internal controversy; the United States, which is experiencing 
an economic depression, does not need to take such a great risk. 
4) Clinton does not have a detailed plan for using force as a 
backup. How many troops will he dispatch? How long will the 
United States fight? How big will the scale of the war be? If 
Congress does not support it, he will back off from the plan. 
  The United States always assumes a harsh posture before 
talks 
are held, in an attempt to silence its opponent and make it 
yield, so that it can gain the upper hand at the negotiating 
table. But after assuming a magnanimous posture, its character 
usually comes to light--ability falling short of ambition. If 
its opponent insists, it will back off. This "Solomon-type" [as 
published] trick has become outdated. 
  Is the DPRK developing nuclear weapons? Russia is the 
country which designed the nuclear reactor for the DPRK. A 
senior person in charge of Russian nuclear energy said that the 
assertion that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons is a 
vilification; the DPRK is not manufacturing nuclear weapons. 
  Clinton's "sanctions" have, on the contrary, provided the 
DPRK with an opportunity to bargain--it can conduct diplomatic 
contacts with the United States through "freezing its production 
of nuclear weapons." The upcoming dramatic development will be: 
The United States and the DPRK will hold talks in Geneva. The 
noise of "sanctions" has temporarily subsided.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Kang Changxing: "King Husayn's Visit To </F>
Washington Yield Constructive Results"] 
  [Text] Amman, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Wounding up [as received] 
his official visit to the U.S., King Husayn of Jordan left 
Washington Thursday [23 June] heading for London on his way back 
home. 
  Public opinion here considered King Husayn's visit as being 
successful and yield [words indistinct] economic, political and 
military fields. 
  During his visit, King Husayn held separate talks with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and other high-ranking officials on the bilateral relations, the 
situation in the Middle East region, the latest developments in 
the peace process, especially on the Jordanian-Israeli track, 
and the economic and military cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  The talks aimed at bolstering the bilateral relations and 
boosting trust and understanding between Jordan and America. 
  Political observers here stressed that this visit 
contributed 
to identifying the viewpoints of Jordan and the U.S. on the 
peace process. 
  The visit came in the light of remarkable progress on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track of peace talks on the demarkation of the 
border lines, water quotas and security along with other issues. 
  King Husayn highlighted his commitment to his positive 
attitude toward the Jordanian-Israeli peace talks, voicing his 
readiness to meet Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at a 
suitable time. 
  Jordan's positive attitude, which came at a time when the 
peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track has been deadlocked 
since the Hebron massacre in February, is highly-appreciated by 
the American side which deems it as a courageous step. 
  This indicates that Jordan is trying to assure the U.S. that 
it is still playing an important and indispensable role in the 
peace process. 
  On the other hand, the American side needs a new progress on 
the Jordanian-Israeli track to reactivate the stalemated talks 
on the Syrian-Israeli track, and then to put the 
Lebanese-Israeli talks on the right track. 
  King Husayn made it clear that his country still endeavors 
to 
reach a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli 
dispute and will not sign any peace deal with Israel without 
securing progress on the other Arab-Israeli tracks. 
  He pointed out that Jordan seeks to safeguard its national 
interests as well as the pan-Arab common interests. 
  The American side voiced its support for the Jordanian 
tendency and its commitment to reaching a just and comprehensive 
settlement in the Mideast region, thus enabling Jordan to 
coordinate its stance with the other Arab sides. 
  King reviewed with the U.S. officials the economic problems 
Jordan faces now due to the Gulf war, pointing out that this 
situation is incompatible with the role played by Jordan now. 
  He called on the American side to extend economic and 
military aid to Jordan to enable it to get out of the economic 
crisis and play more positive role in the Mideast peace process. 
  The American side voiced its understanding and sympathy 
toward this call. 
  Bill Clinton pledged his support for Jordan to alleviate the 
burdens of its due debts to the U.S. amounting to about 1 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  The U.S. Administration will support the Jordanian economic 
development and meet the Jordanian security prerequisites in 
view of the progress achieved in the peace process, Clinton 
pledged. 
  He also pledged to help convince the Western creditors to 
reschedule Jordan's some 6 billion dollars debts due to them. 
  The positive results secured by the visit of King Husayn to 
the U.S. will necessarily activate the Middle East peace process 
and help Jordan play greater role in this process. 
  Political observers anticipate a new progress to be secured 
on the Jordanian-Israeli track of peace talks relating to 
border-line demarkation and water quotas.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Dacheng] </F>
  [Text] Baghdad, June 24 (XINHUA) -- A team of UN arms 
experts have sealed Iraq's medium-range missiles in an effort to 
prevent them from being modified into long-range missiles that 
are banned by the UN resolution ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  Mark Silver, an American ballistic missile expert and head 
of 
the 30-member team, told reporters today that they have 
accomplished all the task to put tags on the operational 
missiles for the non-modification purpose. 
  "These missiles are very dangerous because they are in a 
capability that are ready to launch," silver said upon his 
departure for New York. 
  Along with the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, 
Iraq's long-range missiles had been destroyed by the end of 
March 1992 in accordance with UN resolutions, but Iraq is 
allowed to possess and produce medium- and short-range missiles 
(less than 150 kilometers) for self-defense. 
  A missile reportedly exploded last year while under test at 
an Iraqi site, damaging the surrounding UN monitoring video 
cameras which are remotely controlled by UN experts in downtown 
Baghdad. 
  The missiles experts also paid a total of seven inspections 
to Iraqi missile sites and facilities during their 15-day 
mission, but they found no violation of the cease-fire terms, 
Silver said. 
  He praised his Iraqi counterparts' cooperation during his 
mission, saying, "The Iraqis did what we were asking them to do." 
  Silver and his men are expected to come back to Iraq 
periodically to inspect and verify the tags on the missiles as 
part of the UN plan for long-term monitoring of Iraq's 
weapons-related industries which was accepted by Iraq last 
November. 
  "Among taggings, cameras and other surveillance means, the 
best way is human eye," Silver said. "They cannot beat the 
human eye." 
  Iraqi compliance with destruction of its nuclear, biological 
and chemical weapons and long-range missiles and monitoring of 
its weapons programs is a prerequisite to lifting the UN oil 
embargo though the United States has been seeking to add other 
conditions.

<F P=106> ["International Jottings" by Yang Huasheng (2799 5478 0581): </F>
"Russia and NATO Do a Tango"] 
  [Text] On 21 June, NATO and Russia signed a joint 
statement on their future bilateral relations. In Brussels on 
22 June, Russia's Foreign Minister officially signed the 
"Partnership for Peace" accord with NATO. Did this indicate 
that the previous twists and turns in the relationship between 
Russia and NATO finally had come to an end? 
  In the last few months, Russia shilly-shallied over the 
issue 
of joining NATO's "Partnership for Peace" scheme, and things in 
this regard underwent many twists and turns. The Russian 
military, government, and foreign affairs leaders continued to 
chop and change in their relevant statements, and often made 
things very confusing. The fundamental reason for Russia's 
chopping and changing lay in the fact that its strategic 
relationship with NATO would directly concern its status as a 
big power and the future strategic pattern of Europe. In 
addition, this was also because Russia and NATO had their own 
calculations and understandings on the issue of forming the 
"Partnership for Peace." 
  The "Partnership for Peace" scheme was adopted by the NATO 
summit meeting last January, and its central point was to adapt 
NATO to the new, post-Cold War situation by replacing the 
previous "containment strategy" with the "expansion strategy." 
NATO will be expanded, from the current 16 members in Europe 
and America, to the east; it will include former Warsaw Pact 
members and other members of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. At present, 20 non-NATO countries have 
joined the partnership, and they include some Central Asian 
countries in the former Soviet Union. In fact, NATO's force and 
influence have stretched to the fence of Russia. 
  Undoubtedly, being a big power, Russia's mentality was 
complicated when deciding to joint the West's peace partnership. 
It had a lot of doubts and misgivings. Russia was worried that 
there were "overtones" in the scheme designed by NATO. While 
safeguarding its dignity and status as a big power, Russia did 
not want to bring its relations with the West to a deadlock, nor 
could it touch the sensitive nerve of the former Soviet Union 
and the East European countries on safeguarding their national 
sovereignty and independence. Some veteran diplomats said that 
if Russia did not promptly adjust its relations with NATO on the 
issue of the "Partnership for Peace," it would face a dangerous 
situation of siege and isolation. It was against this 
background that Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who used to 
maintain a tough attitude, announced to NATO on 24 June that 
Russia would unconditionally join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
scheme. In early June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev made a 
statement in Paris, particularly stressing that Russia and NATO 
should set up a cooperative relationship that would make the two 
sides "not antagonistic toward each other, nor launching sudden 
attacks on each other." He said that Russia would "not subject 
its political and military actions to NATO's orders, nor plan to 
oppose NATO's actions." 
  So far, NATO has not made any substantial concessions to 
Russia's special demands; at least, NATO has not done this 
verbally and openly. However, through repeated consultations 
over more than one month, while adhering to its established 
principles, NATO has expressed a certain degree of understanding 
and compromise toward Russia's wishes. For example, NATO Deputy 
Secretary General Balansino said at the opening session of the 
foreign ministers' meeting on 9 June: "Russia is not only at 
present, but will continue to be in the future, the sole most 
powerful country in Europe"; therefore, "without Russia's 
participation, it is impossible to build a new security system 
in Europe." 
  A German newspaper said: The present relationship between 
NATO and Russia is something like that between two strange 
partners doing a tango. They may not coordinate each other's 
pace by tacit agreement, and sometimes one may step on the 
other's foot or hit the other's leg. Some experts predicted 
that because of the differences in conceptions, positions, 
policies, and interests between the two sides, frictions and 
conflicts may still be unavoidable between NATO and Russia in 
the future.

<F P=106> ["Roundup"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- A fanfare resounds this 
afternoon once again in the front of the Great Hall of the 
People. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin is hosting a ceremony to 
welcome Mauritian President Cassam Uteem and accompanying him in 
a review of a guard of honor of the three services of the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army. 
  This is the sixth time this month that foreign heads of 
state 
and government have reviewed the Chinese honor guard, which, in 
the past six months, has received foreign dignitaries from 26 
countries, including the French prime minister and Egyptian 
president. 
  The frequent appearance of the honor guard of the three 
services in front of the Great Hall of the People reveals one 
aspect the busy scenario of this year's Beijing diplomatic 
activities. 
  In the meantime, Chinese leaders have toured the five 
continents. The forthcoming official visit to Austria, Germany 
and Romania by Premier Li Peng starting June 29 will be the 
sixth major trip abroad by a senior Chinese leader. 
  For China, a country busily engaged in a modernization 
drive, 
a peaceful international environment constitutes a major 
external condition, and the absorption of foreign capital, 
technologies and advanced expertise is a crucial part of opening 
up to the outside world. 
  Developing ties with other countries in the diplomatic, 
economy and trade, scientific and technological, and cultural 
fields is in line with China's present and future interests. 
  Consolidation and expansion of good-neighborly ties of 
friendship with other countries remains atop China's diplomatic 
agenda. Now, a stable and good-neighborly environment has come 
into being and China's ties with its neighbors have entered the 
best period in history. 
  In the past few months China has received the Azerbaijani 
president and the Russian prime minister. During Premier Li 
Peng's tour of four central Asian countries and Mongolia, China 
signed a historic border agreement with Kazakhstan and a 
friendship and co- operation treaty with Mongolia. 
  Frequent high-level exchanges are featured in this year's 
Sino- Europe relations. In the first half of the year, China 
played host to Romanian and Estonian presidents as well as prime 
ministers from Slovakia, Finland, France and Portugal. 
  Meanwhile, chairman Qiao Shi of the Standing Committee of 
the 
National People's Congress and Chairman Li Ruihuan of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference called on eight European nations. 
  The good political links have lent an impetus to the 
mutually 
beneficial co-operation in economy and trade, and science and 
technology. As a result, the economic and trade co-operation 
between China and western Europe has maintained strong growth, 
while that between China and eastern Europe has been 
reinvigorated following a period of stagnation. 
  The past six months have also witnessed new growth in ties 
between China and the American countries. A Chinese Communist 
Party (CPC) group headed by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing 
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, 
travelled to Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, and the presidents 
of Ecuador, Surinam and Peru have been to China. 
  The trip to Beijing by Canadian Governor General Hnatyshyn 
marked the normalization of all-round ties between the two 
countries. The Canadian prime minister is also expected to be 
here later this year. 
  Sino-U.S. ties have maintained the trend toward improvement 
and development. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher have visited Beijing this 
year, while Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, State Councillor 
Song Jian and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation Wu Yi have been invited to visit the U.S. In 
addition, the three joint commissions on economy, commerce and 
trade, and science and technology have been reopened. 
  At the end of last May U.S. President Bill Clinton decided 
to 
extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status and to delink 
future annual MFN reviews from human rights issues. The 
decision creates favorable conditions for the further 
strengthening and expansion of trade and economic co-operation 
between the two sides and for the improvement and growth of the 
overall relations between the two countries. 
  Meanwhile, during the past six months China has continued to 
consolidate its unity and co-operation with African countries. 
Earlier this year, it resumed diplomatic ties with Lesotho. And 
the defunct apartheid system and the birth of a new South Africa 
has created favorable conditions for the establishment and 
development of friendly ties of co-operation between China and 
South Africa. 
  Apart from all this, China has been actively involved in 
multilateral diplomacy and has strengthened its co-operation 
with other countries within the United Nations and other 
international organizations. 
  At the 50th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights 
last 
March China frustrated, with the support of other 
justice-upholding countries, an attempt to interfere in China's 
internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. This once 
again demonstrated the degree of unity and co-operation between 
China and other developing countries. 
  At present, Beijing is vigorously making preparations for 
the 
Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held here next year. 
  In addition, after signing the Uruguay Round accords, China 
is girding itself to become a founding member of the World Trade 
Organization.

  [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The five principles of 
peaceful co-existence, after 40 years of tests in practice, have 
shown their strong vitality and become universally accepted 
basic norms governing relations between nations. 
  This June 28 will be the 40th anniversary of the 
introduction 
of the five principles -- mutual respect for each other's 
territorial integrity and sovereignty; non-aggression; 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equal and 
mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. 
  With the end of the Second World War, movements of national 
independence and liberation flourished in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America. Newly independent nations demanded the establishment 
of new patterns of international relations based on equality to 
maintain their national sovereignty and develop their economies. 
  The five principles of peaceful co-existence were produced 
precisely in response to this strong and common demand of newly 
independent nations. 
  After their rebirths, China and India, two giants in Asia, 
established diplomatic relations on April 1, 1950. 
  On April 29, 1954, the two countries signed an agreement on 
trade and communications between the Chinese region of Tibet and 
India, introducing for the first time the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence into the preface of the agreement. 
  In June 1954, former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited 
india 
and Burma at the invitation of the two countries and held talks 
with his then Indian and Burmese counterparts, Jawaharlal Nehru 
and U Nu. 
  Consequently, in the "joint declaration of Chinese and 
Indian 
premiers" issued on June 28 and the "joint declaration of 
Chinese and Burmese premiers" issued on the following day, the 
five principles of peaceful co-existence were officially 
announced as the basic norms guiding the Sino-Indian and 
Sino-Burmese relations. 
  The Sino-Indian Joint Declaration proposed that "these 
principles not only be applicable to relations between nations, 
but also to the general international relationship," while the 
Sino-Burmese Joint Declaration expressed the hope that "these 
principles will be observed by all nations." 
  In April 1955 -- one year after China, India and Burma 
initiated the five principles of peaceful co-existence, a total 
of 29 newly independent nations from Asia and Africa held the 
historic "Asian- African conference" in Bandung, Indonesia. 
  As a result of the common efforts of the participants, the 
conference adopted the "declaration on promotion of world peace 
and cooperation" and formulated the 10 principles of Bandung 
Conference. These 10 principles, which contained all points in 
the five principles of peaceful co-existence, represented an 
extension and development of the latter. 
  Since then, the five principles of peaceful co-existence 
have 
been recognized and accepted by more and more nations, 
international organizations and international meetings; and have 
been incorporated into a series of major international 
documents, including declarations adopted by the United Nations 
General Assembly. 
  The five principles were also reaffirmed in the documents on 
China's establishment of diplomatic relations with more than 100 
nations, including Western countries like the United States, and 
in treaties as well as communiques China has signed with other 
countries. 
  The world today is characterized by diversities. There are 
about 1,000 ethnic nationalities and more than 200 countries, 
including more than 180 independent, sovereign nations. 
  They differ not only in social system and development level, 
but also in ideology, cultural heritage, national character and 
religious belief. 
  The past decades have proved that whenever a few countries 
in 
disregard of the said differences, tried stubbornly to impose 
their concepts of value on "democracy" and "human rights" as 
well as their social systems on other countries, there would 
invariably be unrest and chaos, making such practice utterly 
futile. 
  Similarly, contradictions would be exacerbated and 
international tensions heightened if the modes of "big family," 
"bloc politics," "sphere of influence" and "world leadership" 
were applied in handling international relations. 
  With the end of the Cold War, there is no more bloc 
confrontation characterized by the contention for hegemony 
between the two superpowers. 
  However, manifestations of power politics still exist in 
international relations, marked by the big suppressing the 
small, the strong bullying the weak, interference in others' 
internal affairs under various excuses, and frequent threats to 
apply sanctions and even to use force. 
  Therefore, it is still a matter of paramount and realistic 
significance to firmly uphold and apply the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence in international relations. 
  These five principles have generalized the most basic norms 
that govern international relations transcending the limits of 
social system and ideology. 
  Only when international relations are completely based on 
the 
five principles of peaceful co-existence; the differences 
between nations are duly recognized and respected; all nations, 
big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are recognized as 
equals in the international community with the right to choose 
their own ideology, social system and the mode of development 
suitable for them; and mutual exchange, seeking of common 
grounds and keeping of differences as well as mutual 
complementation are encouraged, can the nations co-exist 
peacefully and enjoy genuine international peace, stability and 
development. 
  In order to promote peace and development, a peaceful, 
stable, just and equitable new international political and 
economic order should be established on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful co-existence and on the premise of 
recognizing the diversity of the world and differences between 
nations. 
  Under such a new order, mutual respect, equality and 
cooperation between nations will take the place of hegemonism 
and power politics; negotiations and dialogues will replace the 
use and the threat of the use of force; and mutual benefit and 
mutual supplementation will substitute for trade protectionism 
and unequal exchanges. 
  To realize the goals of the five principles of peaceful 
co-existence, the international community needs to cooperate 
extensively and make long-term and unremitting efforts.

  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- The five principles of 
peaceful coexistence provide a sound basis for building a new 
international order, according to China-based Indian and Myanmar 
[Burma] ambassadors in recent interviews with XINHUA. 
  The five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual 
respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs, [equality and mutual benefit] and peaceful 
coexistence, were jointly promoted by China, India and Myanmar 
in June 1954. 
  Indian Ambassador to China Das Gupta told XINHUA that India 
and Myanmar were the first two countries outside the socialist 
camp to establish diplomatic relations with China, following the 
birth of the People's Republic of China in 1949. 
  In April 1954, India and China signed an agreement on trade 
and intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India. 
The five principles came to be formulated by the two sides 
during discussions on this agreement and they were incorporated 
in the preamble of the agreement as guiding principles in 
India-China relations, he said. 
  The leaders of the two countries believed that the 
principles 
also had a wider application. They were relevant not only to 
bilateral ties but as guiding principles for international 
relations generally. This was the message of the joint 
statement of the prime ministers of India and China in New Delhi 
on June 28, 1954, he said. 
  "We are deeply convinced that these principles remain as 
relevant today as they were in 1954," said the Indian ambassador. 
  They provide a peaceful, just and cooperative international 
order in which countries may cooperate with others but not 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, he 
stressed. 
  Recalling the five principles enshrined in the Myanmar-China 
joint statement on June 29, 1954, Myanmar ambassador to China U 
Set said that the early 1950s was a time when the whole world 
faced insecurity and instability with the threat of nuclear war. 
  Having gone through a period of foreign domination, Myanmar 
and China shared similar perceptions on the desire for peace, 
for preservation of newly-won independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, and for the right to choose and shape our 
own destiny, U Set said. 
  Both countries believed that if these principles were 
observed by all nations in the world, peace, security and mutual 
trust and confidence would be restored and the fears of 
aggression and interference in internal affairs could be 
avoided, he noted. 
  In the past 40 years since the annunciation of the 
principles, U Set continued, Myanmar and China have stuck to 
them and developed a brotherly friendship based on these 
principles. 
  These principles remain as valid as they were 40 years ago, 
he stressed. 
  Though the Cold War has ended, the Myanmar ambassador 
pointed 
out, the current world remains marked with disputes and armed 
conflicts, with religious and ethnic conflicts, with 
inequalities and injustice. And political, economic, and social 
problems still abound in the world today. 
  The world still faces many instances of resorting to force 
rather than trying to seek peaceful solutions. Direct or 
indirect attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other 
countries still exist, he added. 
  On the other hand, in this increasingly interdependent 
world, 
there is a growing need for nations to unite and cooperate with 
each other to achieved progress and development, he said. 
  It therefore becomes imperative that all nations should try 
to strictly adhere to the five principles that are essential for 
the creation of a peaceful, just and equitable international 
order, the ambassador concluded.

<F P=106> ["Random talk on Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao" column by He </F>
Biao (0149 2871): "View of 'Division of Sovereignty' Should 
End"] 
  [Text] Recently, when speaking on relations between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's Li Teng-hui has 
repeatedly promoted the view of a division of sovereignty, 
claiming that "sovereignty belongs to the whole people" and 
"Taiwan is a sovereign state," opposing the PRC's "possession of 
sovereignty over Taiwan," and stressing that the two sides of 
the strait are "split, separately ruled, and separated." These 
remarks run counter to historical facts, disregard the 
principles of international law, and completely conflict with 
the aspirations of compatriots on the two sides of the strait 
for the reunification of the motherland. 
  As everyone knows, state sovereignty can be neither divided 
nor shared. Therefore, the PRC is the sole legitimate 
government representing the entire Chinese people and Taiwan is 
a province of China. This is a fact generally recognized by the 
international community. 
  Li Teng-hui's attempt to use the view of a "division of 
sovereignty" to mislead the public and to create "two Chinas" or 
"one China, one Taiwan" can only be a vain one. 
  Last year, the Taiwan authorities conducted activities 
around 
the world aimed at "dual recognition" in an attempt to force the 
question of discussing Taiwan's UN representative onto the 
agenda of the UN General Assembly, and openly declared that they 
had to pursue the "two Chinas as a phase" policy, but they only 
came to grief in the end. Since the beginning of the year, 
Taiwan leaders have been all the more unscrupulous in 
successively using "vacation diplomacy," "in-transit diplomacy," 
and "dollar diplomacy." All these activities only ended up with 
fruitless trips to and fro. Therefore, they lamented that 
"sovereignty is a dangerous word" and then changed to promoting 
"sovereignty rests with the people" instead, in an attempt to 
avoid the "legitimate central government," which is crucial to 
determining where sovereignty rests. They use the separation of 
the people between the two sides of the strait as an excuse to 
split state sovereignty in order to achieve the goal of 
splitting Taiwan from the mainland. 
  Following the advocacy of such views as "one country, two 
governments," "political entities on an equal footing," and "two 
Chinas as a phase" by a small number of people in Taiwan, 
including Li Teng-hui, they have now put forward the "view of a 
division of sovereignty," repeating the old trick in a new way. 
Their real intention is to obstruct the process of the 
motherland's peaceful reunification so as to build a "small 
royal palace" in a peaceful corner. 
  Safeguarding the unity and integrity of national sovereignty 
and promoting the realization of the reunification of the 
motherland are in the fundamental interests of the entire 
Chinese people as well as the common aspirations of compatriots 
on the two sides of the strait. Will one not bring disgrace and 
ruin on oneself if one acts against this great trend?! 
  Taiwan leaders should have a clear understanding of the 
situation and should not continue to slide down the path of 
splitting the country and splitting the nation.

<F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320), FAZHI </F>
RIBAO reporter Zhang Ya (1728 0068), and XINHUA reporters Fan 
Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Zhu Guoxian (2612 0948 6343): "The 
Ins and Outs of the Qiandao Lake Incident -- Both Sides of the 
Taiwan Strait Are Torn by Sorrow and Anger, and the Souls of the 
Deceased Are Comforted Through Strict Law Enforcement"] 
  [Excerpts] Hangzhou, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- Upon reviewing the 
facts, the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People's Court rendered a 
verdict on 19 June, in which it sentenced robbery and murder 
convicts Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun to death and 
deprived them of political rights for life. The three convicts 
were subsequently taken to the execution grounds where they were 
shot to death. 
  The Qiandao Lake incident was brought to an end. This major 
criminal case stirred the emotions of countless compatriots on 
both sides of the Taiwan strait, from the time of its occurrence 
on 1 April until the end of the legal proceedings. 
<H8>  I. </H8>
  At 0805 [2405 GMT] on 1 April 1994, the Chunan County Public 
Security Bureau in Zhejiang Province received a report that a 
tour boat had caught fire on Qiandao Lake. The county party 
committee, government, and public security bureau immediately 
sent fire brigade and medical personnel to the scene to 
extinguish the fire and carry out rescue operations. 
  An investigation carried out at the time showed that the 
boat, the "Hairui," with a Taiwan tour group on board, had left 
Shendu, Anhui Province, for Qiandao Lake on 31 March and was 
scheduled to reach Maozhuyuan pier in Chayuan Town, Chunan 
County on the evening of the same day. There were 24 Taiwan 
tourists, two tour guides, and six crew members on board. 
  Harbor inspection personnel from the Chunan County Shipping 
Administration were the first to arrive on the scene at 0830 
[2430 GMT]. Thick smoke was billowing from the boat's lower 
cabin. The harbor inspection personnel, disregarding their own 
safety, boarded the burning boat and used the fire extinguishers 
on board to put out the fire. Shortly thereafter, two fire 
trucks arrived on a ferryboat. The firefighters contained the 
fire 10 minutes later. Accumulated water, however, caused the 
boat to list. The rescue personnel had to bail "Hairui" out 
while towing her to a nearby ferry dock where they continued to 
extinguish the fire. 
  Because no people were found dead on deck or in the 
passenger 
cabin during rescue operations, the provincial party committee 
and government ordered a quick search for missing persons from 
the boat. To conduct the search, Chunan County sent more than 20 
boats carrying over 1,000 people to comb the waters in bays and 
around islets within 40 km of the scene of the incident. Using 
wire broadcasts, they also asked residents in the lake area to 
provide clues. Air Force troops stationed in Zhejiang mobilized 
airplanes, and the East China Sea Fleet also sent people to 
assist in the search-and-rescue mission. 
  After the fire on the "Hairui" had been extinguished, Liu 
Yongjian, head of the criminal investigation detachment under 
the county public security bureau, was the first to enter the 
lower cabin to survey the area in the hopes of finding out what 
had happened there. Covering his mouth and nose with a towel, 
he braved the thick pungent smoke billowing out from the cabin. 
There he found some dead bodies. After bailing out the cabin 
and counting the bodies, he found the bodies of all 32 people 
board the boat were in the lower cabin. 
  CPC Central Committee and State Council leaders were very 
concerned about the incident and issued an important directive 
on dealing with it. They instructed that matters arising in the 
aftermath of the incident be handled earnestly, and that the 
cause of the incident be determined swiftly. The Taiwan Affairs 
Office under the State Council, Public Security Ministry, and 
Communications Ministry also immediately sent personnel to the 
scene. Based on reports filed from Zhejiang, the Association 
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] promptly took 
the initiative in briefing the Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] on the relevant facts. [passage omitted on how 
local leaders organized efforts to deal with matters arising in 
the wake of the incident] 
  On 4 April, more than 50 family members of the deceased 
Taiwan compatriots arrived in Chunan County to discuss matters 
arising in the aftermath of the incident with civil affairs, 
tourism, and other departments in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou 
city. Vice Governor Liu Xirong and ARATS Deputy Secretary 
General Liu Gangqi visited the Taiwan compatriots at their 
hotels to offer condolences for the deceased and to express 
sympathy to the bereaved families. 
  The bodies of the Taiwan compatriots killed in the 
incident were identified after careful examination and 
identification by their families. The Zhejiang authorities 
invited Master Jiyun, the abbot of the Hangzhou Lingyin Temple, 
to perform Buddhist rites and memorial services for the 
deceased. Following patient and careful communication between 
the two sides, the remains of the Taiwan compatriots killed in 
the incident were escorted by their families to the Tonglu 
County Funeral Parlor for cremation on the afternoon of 6 April 
and their ashes were taken back to Taiwan by their families. 
Mr. Lin Weiyang, general manager of Taiwan's Soaring Travel 
Service who was involved in dealing with the remains of the 
deceased throughout the period, said: "Mainland departments in 
charge of the incident have made all possible arrangements. 
After having done what is humanly possible, we have to defer to 
God's will. May the deceased rest in peace soon." 
  Some high-ranking officials and politicians on Taiwan Island 
began issuing strong statements of condemnation on 2 April 
following the incident. Using such phrases as "utter disregard 
for human life" and "bandits," they launched vicious attacks and 
turned the incident into a political affair. On 12 April, 
Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Council" made the following 
announcement: "As of today, cross-strait cultural and 
educational exchanges will be suspended temporarily" and "As of 
1 May, mainland-bound tours by local people will be 
discontinued." Forces for Taiwan independence also seized on 
the opportunity to raise a hue and cry, and to provoke the call 
for "Taiwan independence." 
  The Taiwan authorities' actions cast a shadow over 
cross-strait relations and exchanges, and attracted attention at 
home and abroad. 
  On 12 April, ARATS Executive Vice President Tang Shubei met 
with SEF Deputy Secretary General Shi Qiping [Shih Chi-ping] in 
Beijing, during which the former briefed the latter on how 
mainland central and local authorities took the incident 
seriously and how they managed it as best they could. He 
reiterated: The mainland guarantees Taiwan compatriots' safety, 
both in terms of their lives and property. State laws offer 
equal protection to both Taiwan and mainland compatriots. The 
Qiandao Lake incident cannot and should not affect the 
development of cross-strait relations. More important, we 
should not "politicize" the incident and allow it to worsen 
cross-strait relations which have been built up with great 
difficulty. 
<H8>  II. </H8>
  The investigation was greatly hampered by the fact that all 
passengers and crew members aboard the "Hairui" tour boat had 
been killed and that there were no eyewitnesses at the time of 
the incident. Faced with this complicated and major case, 
public security officers and experts showed a strong sense of 
responsibility toward the people, and commenced a methodical and 
intensive investigation. 
  Yu Zhangchun, a 30-year-old deputy director of the Chunan 
County Public Security Bureau, was the first public security 
officer to arrive on the scene. Prevented from approaching the 
tour boat by the firefighting operation, he led four public 
security motorboats to search the surrounding waters and 
obtained several leads with which they could judge the 
approximate time and place of the incident. The sketch showing 
the "Hairui's" route before and after the incident, compiled by 
the county public security bureau on 2 April, was confirmed by 
the testimony provided by the criminals after the incident. 
  Ding Hong, head of the Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau 
forensic office, rushed to the scene at 2300 [1500 GMT] on 1 
April. The lower cabin was submerged in 50 centimeters of 
water; bodies were floating or submerged in the water. To find 
out whether all 32 people on the boat were dead, Ding Hong and 
three other officers entered the lower cabin, which covered an 
area of just 17.1 square meters and was 1.5 meters high, to 
survey the area with flashlights. They worked until 0400 [2000 
GMT] the next morning. When the bodies were removed the next 
day, they squatted down in the cabin and assigned numbers to, 
photographed, and videotaped the bodies. The smell in the cabin 
was suffocating. The four men, who sweated profusely, removed 
the bodies with their bare hands after their rubber gloves were 
damaged. From 1200 [0400 GMT] to 1700 [0900 GMT], they removed 
all 32 bodies from the lower cabin. 
  On the evening of 2 April, 14 forensic experts sent by the 
Hangzhou City Public Security Bureau carefully examined the 
bodies. 
  Trace analysts collected 36 bags of "charred ashes" from the 
cabin, washed them, and conducted a careful technical appraisal 
of the screened substances. 
  Before long, the forensic experts prepared a report on the 
general status of the bodies. The autopsy report concluded that 
the victims were still alive before they entered the lower 
cabin, and that their deaths were caused by suffocation and 
burning. 
  Firefighting experts confirmed that the fire was started at 
the entrance to the lower cabin, and that gasoline was added to 
the flames. Shipping experts excluded the possibility of the 
fire being caused by latent defects on the boat and its 
equipment. 
  During the survey, trace analysts found that the iron 
ladder at the entrance to the lower cabin was defective. They 
also found a gasoline canister in the center of the spot where 
the fire was started. Round dents caused by shots from hunting 
rifles were also found on the steel plate above the entrance to 
the lower cabin. There were traces of an explosion on the oil 
tank in the cabin. 
  Criminologists analyzed that people on the boat were most 
likely forced into the cabin under the threat of violence and 
were burned to death afterward. 
  Public security organs confirmed that the incident was a 
premeditated, well-prepared robbery and murder case of 
exceptional proportions, and they formally put the case on file 
for investigation. [passage omitted on how police officers 
devoted themselves to solving the case] 
  The leads in the investigation gradually pointed to Wu 
Lihong, who operated a motorboat service without a license. 
  On the day of the incident, Wu Lihong bought three gasoline 
canisters, one of which was never returned. The specifications 
of the missing canister were the same as those of the one found 
on the "Hairui." Prior to the incident, Wu Lihong had bought 
civilian-use explosives and hunting rifle bullets and had lent 
hunting rifles to other people. An eyewitness saw Wu Lihong 
driving two other men to the lake on a motorboat on the 
afternoon of 31 March. Last year, Wu Lihong borrowed 60,000 
yuan to buy a high-horsepower motorboat, and the debt will 
become due this month. According to an informant, Wu Lihong had 
his hair cut on the morning of 1 April, and burn mark traces 
were found on his eyebrows and on the hair covering his 
forehead. After the incident, he said he would mortgage his 
motorboat for just 30,000 yuan....[ellipses as received] 
  Public security officers immediately launched an 
investigation into Wu Lihong's family life, lifestyle, his 
friends and activities, learning quickly about some suspicious 
activities of two of Wu's close friends, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun. 
Afterward, public security organs resolutely decided to summon 
the suspects immediately. 
  Yu Aijun and Wu Lihong were summoned on the afternoon and 
evening of 15 April. Hu Zhihan was called in the next day. 
  The three criminals bowed their heads in the face of 
conclusive evidence. During the small hours of 17 April, the 
three gave an account of the entire incident and explained their 
motives. The details of their story completely matched the 
information collected during the on-site survey. 
  According to information provided by the three criminals, 
the 
police went to the place where they had stashed their stolen 
goods to recover the booty, which included camcorders, cameras, 
U.S. dollars, new Taiwan dollars, renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, 
wristwatches, rings, jade bracelets, and necklaces. They also 
seized the motorboat, hunting rifles, bullets, and leftover 
explosives which the criminals had used to commit the crime. 
  On 20 April, Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan, and Yu Aijun were 
apprehended in accordance with the law. On 3 June, the Hangzhou 
City People's Procuratorate filed a public indictment in the 
Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court regarding the robbery 
and murder case on Qiandao Lake. 
  After public security organs proclaimed the case solved, 
ARATS promptly notified the SEF and briefed the latter on the 
case on several occasions. Speaking on 18 April, Li Peng, 
premier of the State Council, said: The exceptional robbery and 
murder case on Qiandao Lake has been solved, and the criminals 
have been arrested. They will be dealt with strictly according 
to legal procedures. 
  Most Taiwan compatriots were relieved to hear his words. 
Some people in the Taiwan government, however, continued to 
spread rumors and falsely accused the mainland of "covering up 
the truth," as they attempted to mislead public opinion at home 
and abroad. 
  To safeguard cross-strait relations, and to inform more 
people concerned about the case, especially Taiwan compatriots, 
ARATS sent three letters to the SEF in which it invited SEF 
officials and experts to come to Hangzhou for briefings by 
experts in charge of the case on condition that the judicial 
proceedings not be affected. On 8 May, SEF Deputy Secretary 
General Xu Huiyou [Hsu Hui-yu] led six analysts, criminologists, 
and forensic experts, some lawyers, and seven bereaved family 
members on a visit to Hangzhou. [passage omitted on briefings 
by ARATS officials to the delegation] 
<H8>  III. </H8>
  On 10 June, the Hangzhou City Intermediate People's Court 
held an open trial of the robbery and murder case on Qiandao 
Lake. [passage omitted on details of the crime provided by the 
defendants in court] 
  Justice has a long arm. The three criminals were sentenced 
to death and executed in accordance with the law. The 
compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan strait who were killed 
in the incident can now close their eyes in death. The relevant 
insurance company has made preparations for compensation for the 
Taiwan compatriots killed in the incident, and it is handling 
the case in accordance with relevant provisions. The handling 
of matters arising in the aftermath of the incident, the swift 
solution of this largest criminal case involving Taiwan 
compatriots since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait initiated 
exchanges, and the punishment of the criminals in accordance 
with the law, demonstrate that the state sets great store by 
people's legitimate rights and interests, and has made every 
effort to improve its legal system and safeguard people's lives 
and property. 
  Judging by the rumors flying around the Qiandao Lake 
incident, however, people on the two sides of the Taiwan strait 
perceive and deal with certain issues differently because of 
their long-term separation and different social systems. 
Different perceptions and methods of dealing with matters have 
inevitably given rise to misunderstandings. Farsighted people 
on both sides of the Taiwan strait maintain that the two sides 
should expand exchanges and improve communication to achieve a 
better understanding of each other in an even shorter period of 
time. In dealing with concrete matters involving both sides of 
the Taiwan strait, we must consider the general interest of 
cross-strait relations, and confront and solve problems by 
adopting the attitude of safeguarding the fundamental interests 
of people on both sides of the Taiwan strait, being realistic 
and objective, and seeking truth from facts. We should prevent 
people from making a fuss over something in an attempt to 
undermine cross-strait relations. After learning of the truth, 
some Taiwan newspapers noted: "The Qiandao Lake incident, 
however complicated, is after all a criminal case. It would be 
a serious mistake to dismiss Mainland China's current social 
values or even the blood ties binding all of China together." 
  It should be noted that some people in the Taiwan government 
and a handful of Taiwan independence elements are still 
nonsensically characterizing the incident as an "unsolved case," 
although the truth of the Qiandao Lake incident has been brought 
to light and the criminals have been executed. It seems a few 
people are still trying to exploit this unfortunate incident to 
obstruct and undermine cross-strait relations. Such an attempt 
will eventually prove fruitless. The Qiandao Lake incident was 
an accident and its adverse effects will be temporary. Closer 
cross-strait relations are an inevitable and general trend. 
History will corroborate this point.

  [Text] Beijing, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] today sent a letter 
to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], proposing that 
the SEF organizes a group of news media leaders in Taiwan to 
visit the mainland at a time convenient to both sides in the

of visits between leaders and senior reporters of news media 
between the two sides. The letter also gave the views and 
suggestions of ARATS, after consultations with relevant 
departments, on matters stated in SEF's letters, dated 21

  [Text] China and Britain are now drafting an agreement on 
the Chek Lap Kok airport financial arrangements -- to be signed 
within the next few days, according to the chief negotiators. 
The Sino-British Airport Committee team leaders Guo Fengmin and 
Hugh Davies emerged from a three-hour meeting yesterday to say 
that further progress had been made and that experts will 
prepare a draft deal. 
  Governor Chris Patten said "we are quite close to an 
agreement." 
  "Obviously, this week has seen several strides forward but 
we 
are not quite home yet," he said. "I prefer not to use words 
like agreement until everything is cut and dry.... It is 
important for both sides to have a piece of paper which embodies 
precisely what's been agreed that they can use, for example, 
that we can use when we are talking to bankers and to others. 
We want to get everything sorted out as cleanly and clearly as 
possible." 
  Financial Secretary Sir Hamish MacLeod said he was 
encouraged. "We are in a positive mood. I think both sides are 
working hard to try and reach an agreement and resolve any 
outstanding points," he said. 
  Sources close to the negotiations said the Chinese side 
"seemed to be OK with the figures" contained in the latest 
government financial package, removing the major obstacle over 
the dispute which has dragged on for nearly two years. But they 
were concerned that substantial differences and "new problems" 
might crop up in the process of "putting the figures into a 
document". 
  British team leader, Mr Davies, said: "We agreed that the 
next step should be for experts on both sides to meet as soon as 
possible to draw up documents which will form the basis of 
agreement between us. That is extremely important because 
without such a document it will be difficult to persuade the 
finance houses to provide the finance for the airport and Mass 
Transit Railway Corporation," he said. 
  He hinted there were still some issues in contention. "If it 
had been totally resolved I think I would have come out and told 
you. If it were only wording without substantive issues we could 
have signed it yesterday or this morning. There are some issues 
which need to be sorted out. I hope we will reach an agreement 
before the end of this month. If possible within the next few 
days but everything depends on the drafting group." 
  Mr Guo said the two sides "still need to study some of the 
details and wording in the document". 
  The fourth financial package provides for an equity 
injection 
of $60.3 billion to contain borrowings by the railway 
corporation and the Provisional Airport Authority at about $23 
billion. Mainland sources confirmed there was no new demand on 
the level of equity although China continued to hope that the 
government would be able to reduce the debts to run beyond 1997. 
  The negotiators had disputed whether the borrowings by the 
two corporations should be considered as government borrowings, 
which were limited to $5 billion under the Memorandum of 
Understanding. 
  It is understood that the issue was no longer contentious, 
with neither side insisting that a clear definition of the 
borrowings be written into the draft agreement. 
  "But the details and figures used by the two sides at the 
talks have to be spelled out very precisely and in a sustainable 
form so that the agreement can be implemented," a source said. 
  It is understood an agreement was reached on the disposal of 
land along the rail link and the issue of cost-monitoring. The 
two sides will leave further discussion on the Airport 
Corporation Bill to experts after finalising the financial 
package, sources said.

  [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang on Friday [24 June] issued a stern warning on the 
impact Taiwan's GATT membership may have on the local 
automakers, calling for them to merge to cope with the 
anticipated hard times. 
  "Only by merger can local automakers reach the economies of 
scale, and there is no other alternative," Chiang said in a 
meeting with the senior executives of local car companies. 
There are 11 carmakers in Taiwan vying for a slice of the tiny 
market, but sales of foreign imports have continued to make 
steady gains as tariffs have decreased. Imported cars took 33 
percent of the local market share in 1993, up from 24 percent in 
1991 and 30 percent from 1992, while overall car sales decreased 
3.2 percent to 401,270 in 1993. 
  Chiang said sooner or later, Taiwan must fully open its car 
market in line with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
"That would make the present difficult times even harder," he 
warned. 
  Yet the response to Chiang's proposal from automakers was 
cool despite the fact that some of them have been operating in 
the red. One executive who participated in the meeting simply 
replied that "the time is not yet ripe" when he was asked to 
comment on Chiang's merger suggestion.

  [Text] The provincial work conference on halting deficits 
and increasing profits was held in Shuangcheng city on 24 June. 
  The conference set forth: This year, the province should 
attain the target of reducing 456 million yuan in deficits based 
on the deficit figure of last year. The decrease rate is 11.7 
percent. 
  The conference also urged all localities across the province 
to conscientiously implement the central policy on grasping 
favorable opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding the scale 
of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability; 
to make positive efforts to halt deficits; and to realize the 
1994 targets for halting deficits and increasing profits. 
  The conference urged that all localities should emancipate 
the mind, find breakthroughs from enterprises' bankruptcy and, 
by extensive exploration of ways, rely on reform to change 
mechanisms and enhance vitality, rely on science and technology 
to speed up the pace of transformation and enhance strength, 
rely on management to enhance internal strength and tap 
potentials, rely on policies to optimize the environment and 
expand external strength, and carry out the overall improvement 
policy to make real headway in halting deficits. 
  The conference maintained: Last year, the province made 
noticeable achievements in halting deficits. The budgetary 
industrial, grain, forest industrial, commercial, foreign trade, 
and agricultural production enterprises suffered 2.06 billion 
yuan of deficits during the year, a drop of 839 million yuan or 
33.9 percent from the figure of 1992. Viewing the economic 
operation situation in the first five months of this year, we 
know that there are great difficulties in realizing the 1994 
target for reducing deficits. 
  The conference set forth: All localities should expand the 
dynamics of the property right reform, balance the relations of 
property rights, and solve the problems cropping up due to 
unclear property rights and indefinite rights and 
responsibilities. Enterprises should optimize their existing 
assets and increase economic results. 
  The conference especially stressed: We should have the 
daring to make a breakthrough and make bankruptcy become a kind 
of mechanism for halting deficits. The enterprises that are 
hopeless in halting deficits and those whose assets cannot 
compensate for their debts should declare bankruptcy according 
to the law governing bankruptcy and on the premise that the work 
in all domains has been well handled. 
  The conference also discussed the province's manuscript on 
relevant policy regulations on helping enterprises halt 
deficits. Preferential policy regulations on creating both 
internal and external conditions for helping money-losing 
enterprises halt deficits have been stipulated in this 
manuscript.

  [Text] Hefei, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Hefei, capital of east 
China's Anhui Province, had approved the establishment of 727 
new foreign-funded enterprises by the end of May this year. 
  According to local officials, these enterprises have 
promised 
to invest a total of 520 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 
one third of the province's total foreign investment. 
  The officials said the distribution of foreign investment in 
the city has changed from solely industry oriented and become 
relatively harmonized, with its proportion in agriculture 
standing for two percent, in industry 68 percent and in the 
service trades 30 percent. 
  They added that the city is making experimental efforts to 
establish its own investment funds overseas.

  [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing had a meeting here today with the full board of 
directors of the recently-created Import and Export Bank of 
China (CEIB). 
  He stressed the need to give the utmost help to promote 
China's exports, particularly of machinery, electronics and 
other equipment. 
  CEIB is China's second policy bank after the People's Bank 
of 
China, the central bank. Established in Beijing on April 27 
this year, the bank is responsible for providing import and 
export credits for capital goods, including large machinery and 
electronic equipment. 
  It also handles credits as well as government and commercial 
loans provided by foreign countries for their import of Chinese 
capital goods. 
  Vice-Premier Li recalled that the bank was set up to meet 
the 
needs of establishing a socialist market economic system, speed 
up the reform of the financial system, separate the policy 
banking business from commercial banking business, enable the 
country's foreign trade to develop in a sustained, steady and 
healthy way, improve the structure, grade and quality of export 
commodities, and increase exports. 
  Vice-Premier Li urged the CEIB to formulate strict rules and 
regulations and establish a strict internal management system.

  [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- Inflation rate generally 
tends to move downwards this year but it may still stand at a 
relatively high level, according to "Outlook of China Finance" 
issued by the People's Bank of China which will cover prediction 
of price trend for this year. [sentence as received] 
  The report by the central bank revealed that there were 
several reasons to affect the price level for this year. 
[sentence as received] First, the exchange rate for the 
renminbi was unified effective on January 1 in the restructuring 
of the foreign exchange system. As the gap between the market 
exchange rate and the official exchange rate was rather great in 
the course of the financial reform, prices for imported 
commodities rose to some extent resulting from a rising 
comprehensive exchange price on average following the 
unification of the exchange rate for the renminbi. 
  Second, during the taxation reform, the general tax revenue 
increased to a certain extent following the curbing of an 
unauthorized practice in which localities made their own 
decision to carry out tax reduction and exemption. As the 
taxation restructuring was not fully understood by basic units 
which resulted in inevitable mistakes, some price setting 
entities capitalized the value added tax to raise commodity 
price which directly led to a price hike. [paragraph as received] 
  Third, measures including a proposed price rise in crude oil 
will be adopted within the year. A large-scale price 
fluctuation for some corresponding commodities will appear 
around the time when such measures are about to be implemented. 
  Fourth, rising prices for grains resulted in a climb of 
prices for non-staple food, processed food products and poultry 
eggs. 
  The central government has recently made clear that it was 
determined to stabilize the economy and to lower the inflation 
rate. The report said that such practice by the central 
authorities was very important because it had influence on views 
held by enterprises, local governments and individuals on the 
economic development as well as on the inflation rate for this 
year. [sentence as received] 
  The report also elaborated on the upholding of high interest 
rate, strict restrictions on issuance of currency and the supply 
of credit by the central bank for the first half of this year. 
[sentence as received] Effects from such macro-economic 
regulation will appear gradually which will in turn make the 
inflation rate go downwards during the year. 
  The report, which will be issued late this month, therefore 
expected that the inflation rate tended to go lower generally 
during the year but there would be apparent fluctuation to some 
extent which might see a comprehensive relatively high inflation 
rate on average for the entire year.

  [Text] Beijing, June 27 KYODO -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
repeated his opposition Monday [27 June] to international 
pressure to improve human rights, calling such activities an 
interference in China's internal affairs. 
  During a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the first 
implementation of the "five principles of peaceful coexistence" 
in foreign affairs, the Chinese premier said China would 
continue to oppose interference in its internal affairs "under 
the pretext of human rights." 
  "The affairs of a country should be managed by its own 
people 
who have every right to choose their own social system and 
course of development suited to their national conditions," Li 
told a gathering of foreign emissaries at the Great Hall of the 
People. 
  But the premier added "developed countries have the 
responsibility to help the underdeveloped ones shake off 
poverty" and blamed an "irrational international economic order 
and exchange of unequal values" for the difficulties developing 
countries face. 
  Li said more funds, technology transfers and favorable 
economic policies from developed countries would lead to 
economic growth and social stability in the developing world. 
  The five principles are "mutual respect for sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in 
each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and 
peaceful coexistence," Li said. 
  The principles were first implemented in 1944 in joint 
statements issued by India, Myanmar [Burma] and China. 
  They have been China's unilateral guiding principle in 
foreign affairs ever since.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Speech by Premier Li Peng at a </F>
Meeting Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Promulgation 
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jun (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li 
Peng today delivered a speech at a meeting commemorating the 
40th anniversary of the promulgation of the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence. Full text of the speech follows: 
  Distinguished guests, foreign envoys, ladies and gentlemen: 
  Four decades ago the Chinese Government, along with the 
Indian and Burmese Governments, issued joint statements, 
deciding to make mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's 
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful 
coexistence the basic principles for guiding mutual relations, 
thereby proclaiming the creation of the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence. It is of great significance today that we 
hold the meeting to commemorate this major historical event, to 
evaluate the role played by the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence in the past and in the present, and to look into the 
future development of the world. 
  The five principles of peaceful coexistence were a product 
created by the demand of the times. Following the end of World 
War II, newly independent and liberated nations anxiously wanted 
to establish a new type of international relations based on an 
equal footing, and they yearned for a peaceful international 
environment for developing their national economies. Meanwhile, 
a few countries in the world adopted an attitude of rejecting 
and opposing these newly independent national states, and even 
implemented a policy of aggression and war against them. These 
norms for international relations, which were aimed at 
consolidating national independence, safeguarding national 
sovereignty, and seeking justice and equality, reflected the 
common aspirations of the large number of independent national 
states at that time. It is precisely because of this that the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence received broad 
endorsement from the international community. The 10 principles 
adopted by the Bandung Conference in 1955 specifically 
epitomized the spirit of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. The "Declaration Concerning the Establishment by 
Countries of the Principles for International Law Characterized 
by Friendly Relations and Cooperation in Accordance with the UN 
Charter," adopted by the 25th UN General Assembly in 1970, and 
the "Declaration Concerning the Establishment of a New 
International Economic Order," adopted by the Sixth Special UN 
General Assembly in 1974, both affirmed the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, which have also been cited by many 
international organizations and in the documents of 
international conferences. In fact, the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence have become an important component of the 
norms for international relations. 
  Over the past four decades, the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence have withstood the tests of a changeable 
international situation, demonstrated a powerful vitality, and 
played a tremendous role in promoting world peace and 
international friendship and cooperation. History has born 
witness that the five principles of peaceful coexistence are 
universally applicable norms for international relations. If 
countries with different ideologies, social systems, and 
economic development levels can observe the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, it is entirely possible for them to 
establish relations of mutual trust and friendly cooperation; if 
the five principles of peaceful coexistence are violated, 
confrontation and armed conflicts may take place even between 
countries with identical ideologies and social systems. 
Therefore, it is an irrefutable truth that the five principles 
of peaceful coexistence are the cornerstone for establishing and 
developing relations between countries. 
  As one of the initiating countries of the five principles 
of peaceful coexistence, China has always adhered to and 
practised those principles. Guided by the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, China has established diplomatic relations 
with 158 countries; engaged in economic, trading, scientific, 
technological, cultural exchanges and cooperation with more than 
200 countries and regions; established good-neighborly and 
friendly relations with all neighboring countries; and settled 
border issues left by history with a great majority of 
neighboring countries. In international affairs, China abides 
by the five principles of peaceful coexistence, stands for 
fairness, does not seek selfish gain, and makes proper 
contributions to the peaceful solution of international 
disputes, promoting international cooperation, and maintaining 
regional and world peace. China has contributed its share of 
efforts to help maintain the independence and sovereignty of 
Afghanistan and has also played a constructive role to bring 
about a political solution to the Cambodian issue. China has 
always supported the Korean people in a peaceful settlement of 
reunification problem through dialogue. China always stands for 
a fair and rational solution to the Middle East issue, 
restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, 
and calls on the Arab and Jewish people to live in harmony. 
During the Gulf crisis, China supported the restoration of 
Kuwait's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. 
Since the outbreak of the conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina, China 
has repeatedly called on the parties concerned to cease conflict 
and hostile actions and to seek a political solution to the 
conflict through peace talks. At the United Nations and other 
international organizations, and at a number of important 
international conferences, China has adhered to a just position 
and played a major role in bringing about the solution of major 
international issues. 
  The world has undergone major changes over the past 40 
years. 
The bipolar world structure has ceased to exist. The world is 
rapidly moving toward a multi-polar structure. International 
relations are now undergoing far-reaching changes. Seen from an 
overall perspective, the international situation is relaxing. 
Over the long term, the outbreak of a new world war may be 
avoided. However, the end of the Cold War does not mean that the 
world is in great peace. Ethnic contradictions have intensified 
in some countries and regions, resulting in frequent armed 
conflicts, in unending wars, in turning hundreds and thousands 
of people into refugees, and in a great loss of life and 
property. Some developing countries have sunk deeper into 
poverty. The North-South contradictions have become more acute. 
Hegemonism and power politics still thrive in the world. Cases 
of interference in other countries' internal affairs have been 
frequently reported. Peace and development that are much sought 
after by the people of the world are far from being realized. 
  How, then, to build a new world with stability, security, 
and 
prosperity? For many years, the international community, 
including the United Nations and regional organizations, have 
indeed done a lot and achieved certain results in maintaining 
world peace and promoting common development. However, people 
have more and more come to realize that only by establishing a 
set of basic principles for international relations and for 
international political and economic life which everyone sticks 
to can we expect to generally and effectively guide and 
standardize the international community's activities. We 
believe that the five principles of peaceful coexistence embody 
the most fundamental rules for international relations. They 
are in line with the purpose and principles set down in the 
United Nations Charter. They reflect the essence of 
international relations. They can serve countries of different 
social systems, countries with different levels of economic 
development, and neighboring countries. Therefore, we stand for 
the establishment of a new order in international politics and 
economics based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence 
and by adapting to the changing international situation. 
  Mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs is 
the core of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and of 
the new international order. The world is diversified and 
colorful. Not only the social systems, values, and ideologies 
differ between countries, but also large differences exist 
between their historical traditions, religious beliefs, and 
cultural backgrounds. Only by recognizing these differences and 
showing respect to each other can we broaden the scope of 
cooperation, promote exchange, and get along amicably. It is 
necessary for all countries to learn from each other and to make 
use of each other's experience; however, this is possible only 
if it is based on each country's independence. Imposing one's 
values and social models on other countries inevitably 
encourages tension and confrontation between countries. Each 
country's affairs should be taken care of by its own people. The 
people of each country absolutely have the right to choose a 
social system and development path suitable for their national 
conditions, and other countries should not interfere in the 
country's affairs under any pretext in any way. We hold that 
all countries, big or small, poor or rich, strong or weak, are 
equal members of the international community, and, while seeking 
their own development, can make due contributions to world peace 
and development. 
  Having some differences between countries is inevitable. 
China has always advocated promoting mutual understanding and 
reducing differences through conducting dialogue, and has 
opposed exerting pressure on other countries and interfering in 
other countries' internal affairs. On the human rights issue, 
all countries should conduct dialogue on the basis of equality 
and mutual respect to seek common ground while reserving 
differences, so as to make contributions to protecting human 
rights and to improving the world's human rights conditions. 
Imposing one kind of standard of human rights on others and 
interfering in other countries' internal affairs under certain 
pretexts and ignoring other countries' national conditions and 
law, as a matter of course, will be opposed by a large number of 
developing countries, including China. 
  Mutual respect of each other's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, mutual nonaggression, and peaceful coexistence among 
all countries -- these are the basis of the five principles and 
the new international order. It is unacceptable to use any 
pretext to infringe on other countries' sovereignty, to deprive 
them of their sovereignty, or to encroach on or devour other 
countries' territory, or to use force or to threaten to use 
force as a means to implement one's policy. We should not 
resort to using force to settle disputes between countries; 
achieving a fair and reasonable solution through peaceful talks 
is the only correct way. 
  Here I like to point out in particular that Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, by summing up domestic and international practice, has 
offered many penetrating expositions on the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence. He put forward the great idea of "one 
country, two systems" for solving the Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan issues. He said: "Our putting forward the 'one country, 
two systems' idea to solve China's reunification problem also is 
a kind of peaceful coexistence." He also pointed out: "On some 
international territorial disputes, we may set sovereignty aside 
for the time being and make joint efforts to develop the 
territory in question first." It is just under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's advocating "shelving disputes and making 
common efforts to develop" that China and concerned countries 
have actively sought ways to join efforts to develop regions 
under dispute, in order to preserve peace and stability in this 
region and to prevent tensions from emerging. 
  Equality and mutual benefit are the embodiment of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence in the handling of economic 
relations. In economics, all countries should benefit each 
other by learning from each other's strong points to offset 
their own weaknesses, helping supply each other's needs, and 
cooperating with one another on an equal footing. Protectionism 
of various forms and exchanges of unequal values are 
undesirable. The world economy is an inter-related and 
mutually-dependent whole. Various regions and countries promote 
and supplement each other in economics. At present, some 
developing countries are having economic difficulties of which 
many are caused by an irrational international economic order 
and by exchanges of unequal values. Developed countries have 
the responsibility to help developing nations shake off poverty. 
The worsening of the absolute poverty in some underdeveloped 
countries is an important cause for turmoils, civil wars, and 
even regional conflicts. This is a fact to which the 
international community should attach sufficient importance. 
South-North dialogue and cooperation should be promoted. 
Developed countries should open their markets to developing 
nations, provide development funds, transfer technologies, and 
increase aid to the latter, help the latter reduce its debt 
burden, and thus contribute to the latter's economic development 
and social stability and to narrowing the South-North gap. 
Their doing so will be conducive to their own economic 
development. 
  Distinguished guests; 
  China is going all-out with its modernization program. It 
needs a peaceful international environment and needs to develop 
friendly cooperation with other countries. Comrade Jiang Zemin 
pointed out in his report to the 14th CPC National Congress: 
China has consistently pursued an independent foreign policy of 
peace. The basic objectives of that policy are to safeguard our 
independence and sovereignty and to promote world peace and 
development. China will always stand firm as a strong defender 
of world peace. China will never seek hegemony and expansion; 
it is opposed to hegemonism, power politics, aggression and 
expansion in any form. Under the new international situation, 
we will abide by the five principles of peaceful coexistence and 
continue to actively develop our relations with other countries. 
China will always be a good neighbor to surrounding countries, 
as well as an equal, cooperative partner to other countries. 
  To open up on every side and actively develop economic 
relations with other countries is an important component part of 
China's foreign policy. China will constantly expand and 
strengthen exchanges and cooperation with other countries in the 
economic, scientific, technological, and cultural fields in 
accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit; 
and will actively assimilate the achievements of civilization of 
all mankind, including the advanced business operations and 
management expertise of developed western countries. Over the 
last 15 years, China has opened itself wider and wider to the 
outside world and has now created a pattern of being open on 
every side, with both coastal and interior regions open to the 
outside. The policy of opening up has promoted economic 
development and the improvement of the people's living 
standards, and won wholehearted support from people across the 
country. China's policy of opening up will not change, no 
matter how the international situation changes. 
  Distinguished guests: 
  The 50th anniversary of the United Nations will be ushered 
in 
next year, and mankind will enter the 21st century several years 
later. To sum up the historical experience of human society 
over the last half of the century and make the 21st century one 
of peace, stability, development and prosperity has more and 
more become a common aspiration of the peoples of all countries; 
and it is also a rigorous challenge of history to the 
governments and peoples of all countries. The Chinese 
Government and people will hold aloft the banner of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence and join other countries in 
the world in working hard to build a new international political 
and economic order and create a glorious future of the mankind. 
  Thank you!

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Kim Yong-sun was 
named today as the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea's (DPRK) delegation to the forthcoming pre-Korean summit 
talks at the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  Kim, chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the 
Supreme People's Assembly, will be accompanied at the June 28 
meeting by An Pyong-su, vice-chairman of the committee for the 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun, 
chief councillor of the DPRK Administration Council (cabinet). 
  Details of the delegation membership were given to South 
Korean Premier Yi Yong-tok by the DPRK Prime Minister Kang 
Song-san today. 
  The meeting was proposed by Kang on June 20 as a means of 
organizing detailed arrangements for a North-South summit. The 
DPRK accepted the proposal two days later. 
  Meanwhile, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said the 
outstanding questions between the DPRK and the U.S., including 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and other issues, 
could be resolved in a package deal at the third-round DPRK-U.S. 
talks. 
  Officials from the two countries will meet in Geneva in the 
first week of July for talks over a wide range of political and 
economic issues. 
  However, the spokesman also criticized Japan and South Korea 
following their public outcry calling for a "special inspection" 
of the DPRK's military facilities.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, June 26 (AFP) -- Prime Minister Li Peng 
will be looking to reinforce China's economic miracle and win 
back control of the country's foreign policy when he goes to 
Europe this week. Li starts the two-week tour when he heads for 
Austria on Tuesday. From there he will go on to Germany for a 
week and then on to China's former main European ally, Romania. 
Because of his serious heart problems, this will only be the 
65-year-old prime minister's second trip abroad in two and a 
half years. 
  President Jiang Zemin has instead taken the lead in foreign 
affairs. In the past year, Jiang has been building up air miles 
on foreign travel. The president, a rival to Li in any battle 
for power in the post-Deng Xiaoping era, has earned political 
prestige from appearences with world leaders, such as his 
meeting with President Bill Clinton at last year's Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation forum. 
  "Li Peng is determined to retake control of foreign policy 
that he lost in 1993 and match the good image Jiang Zemin has in 
the West," said one European diplomat in Beijing. 
  Li will be concentrating diplomatic efforts on Germany, 
China's main trading partner in Europe, where he will arrive on 
Sunday. Zhao Ziyang, the man replaced as premier, was the last 
head of government to visit Germany, back in 1985. Relations 
between the two countries are good, even though Beijing 
protested the visit last month to Germany by Tibetan spritual 
leader the Dalai Lama. It was also unhappy at German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel's meeting with Chinese dissident Wang 
Juntao. According to German figures, two-way trade is growing. 
Chinese exports grew 18.25 percent and German exports 67 percent 
over the previous year. German firms are very active in China 
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl harvested an impressive array of new 
contracts on a visit to Beijing last November. Talks will 
concentrate on economic issues, according to German sources in 
Beijing. To help him, Li will be accompanied by 150 trade 
experts and senior Chinese business leaders. Several contracts 
are to be signed, some first discussed when Kohl was in Beijing. 
  The first stage of the tour in Austria will also concentrate 
on trade. But in Romania, where Li will be from July 9 to July 
12, he will renew an old friendship. When Nicolae Ceausescu was 
president of Romania he made his country China's number one ally 
in communist eastern Europe. 
  Li would have liked to visit France on the tour, following 
the normalisation of ties between the two countries when Edouard 
Balladur, the French premier, was in Beijing in April, analysts 
said. But he was not invited. President Jiang Zemin, however, 
was asked by President Francois Mitterrand and should go to 
France in September. "Li Peng considers that to be an affront," 
a Chinese diplomat said. "Each time the problem is discussed it 
makes him angry." 
  Britain is also not on the list. But a visit there is 
unlikely while the dispute continues on how Hong Kong should be 
run after the return to Chinese rule in 1997.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Negotiators from the

<F P=106> [By special reporter Tien Ni (3944 1200) from Jilin: "Due </F>
to International Sanctions on DPRK and Economic Difficulties in 
Russia, Border Trade Between China, DPRK, and Russia Drops By a 
Large Margin"] 
  [Text] According to an internal CPC document, North Korea 
is facing possible sanctions from the international community 
due to the nuclear inspection issue and the country is now short 
of resources. As a result, Sino-Korean border trade in the 
first five months of this year decreased sharply. Informed 
people have said that the decline is unprecedented and the 
margin of the decline was as big as 72.4 percent. This meant 
that the volume of border trade between China and North Korea 
dropped to almost one-quarter of the previous level. 
  The CPC authorities are afraid that North Korea's failure to 
endure the economic pressure will eventually lead to instability 
in the Sino-Korean border area. Thus, they are trying to 
maintain the stability in the border area and have promised to 
give limited material assistance. 
  According to information from the Jilin border area, the 
Chinese side was not happy with North Korea's behavior but China 
also feared that North Korea, which is adjacent to China, would 
behave unscrupulously when the situation becomes critical and 
this would in turn affect China's stability. So, China only 
gave political support to North Korea. 
  Jin Zongzhu, former mayor of Tumen City, an open border town 
in Jilin and current director of the Economic and Trade 
Commission of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, said 
that being affected and constrained by various internal and 
external factors, North Korea sharply decreased its border trade 
with Yanbian Prefecture in the first five months of this year. 
The volume of two-way trade amounted to only $80.44 million, a 
mere 15.5 percent of the yearly target and down by 46.1 percent 
from that in the same period of last year. In particular, the 
exports from the Chinese side amounted to only $22.59 million, 
only 8.7 percent of the yearly target and down by 72.4 percent 
from that in the same period of last year. This marked the 
largest margin of decline in the history of Sino-Korean border 
trade. 
  The possible sanctions imposed by the international 
community 
on North Korea constitute one of the major reasons for the 
decline in Sino-Korean border trade. At present, North Korea, 
being the main trade partner for Yanbian Prefecture, is 
seriously short of energy resources and is undergoing a serious 
economic landslide while facing the possibility of sanctions 
imposed by the Western countries and crop failures. As a 
result, its export commodities continued to decrease and it 
could take fewer and fewer materials in conducting border trade 
with China. At the same time, the rate of trade contract 
fulfillment also dropped to an ever lower level. On the other 
hand, Sino-Russian border trade is also undergoing a sharp 
decline. This is because the Russian economy has been bogged 
down in a predicament for the last few years, plus such problems 
as the unstable political situation, changeable policies, poor 
trade credit, and rising protectionism in the field of foreign 
trade. 
  The dull situation in the Sino-Russian border trade in the 
recent period is reflected in the following figures: In the 
first quarter of this year, the volume of imports made by 
Heilongjiang Province amounted to only $210 million, down by 
52.4 percent from that in the same period of last year, and the 
proportion of imports in the gross volume of imports and exports 
was down by 27 percentage points. At the same time, the volume 
of imports and exports in border trade in the first five months 
of this year decreased by 6 percent. 
  Businessmen engaged in Sino-Russian border trade said that a 
major reason for the decline in Sino-Russian border trade was 
the fact that the Russian side tightened up the visa control 
over people entering its territory and this constrained the 
travel of the people engaged in border trade. In addition, the 
Russian side also restricted the exportation of raw materials, 
increased prices and tariff controls, and tightened up 
supervision over imported goods. After China merged the two 
foreign exchange rates systems and began to levy value-added 
taxes, some Chinese enterprises engaged in border trade recorded 
poorer profits in their business and this lowered the import 
demand on the Chinese side and also affected the export business. 
  Moreover, some market factors also constrained the further 
development of Sino-Russian border trade. As Japan and the DPRK 
increased their competitive power on the Russian market, the 
share of the Chinese products in Russia's Far East market began 
to shrink and the market for Chinese goods became saturated.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Yang Yuanhua (2799 0337 5478): "The New </F>
Development of Relations Between NATO and Russia"] 
  [Text] NATO and Russia announced on 17 June that Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev would hold talks at NATO headquarters 
in Brussels with the U.S. secretary of state and the foreign 
ministers of some other NATO countries on the issue of security 
in the modern world, would sign the framework document on 
Russia's participation in the "partnership for peace" plan, and 
would then make public the documents about the consultations 
between the two sides. This shows that relations between the 
two sides have eased further, reflects Russia's strategic 
conception of fully participating in world affairs, and also 
indicates that bilateral relations will enter a new stage of 
development. 
  Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the 
Soviet Union, NATO and Russia readjusted their respective 
strategies and foreign policies and have reestablished their 
basic principles. In January this year, NATO put forth the 
"partnership for peace" plan to ensure its continuing existence 
and development in an attempt to play a central role in Europe's 
future security pattern so that it could build up closer 
political and military cooperative relations with all European 
countries, including the former USSR republics and neutral 
countries. Russia's participation in the "partnership" is an 
important element of its general plan for fully participating in 
European affairs. 
  The Russian president will attend the European Union summit 
meeting on Greece's Corfu Island on 24 June and will initial a 
partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union. 
Between 8 and 10 July, he will attend the G-7 summit meeting in 
Naples of Italy and will play a full role in political 
consultations for the first time at the "seven plus one" meeting. 
  In order to satisfy Russia's demands, the NATO foreign 
ministers meeting in Istanbul, Turkey on 9 June agreed with 
Russia's proposal for expanding the scope of cooperation 
consultations beyond the "partnership for peace" scheme to cover 
issues such as the settlement of the local conflicts in former 
Yugoslavia and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. NATO 
also accepted the principle of "no veto and no surprise attack" 
and agreed to make public the documents related to the bilateral 
consultations on comprehensive security relations. However, 
NATO only admitted that such consultations were informal and not 
automatic and required that the relevant issues be discussed 
individually. It also insisted that Russia cannot veto NATO's 
decisions but can be notified beforehand of NATO's major 
decisions. 
  On 17 June, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin arrived 
in Brussels and held talks on the details of Russia's full 
security cooperation relationship with NATO. Reportedly, the 
Russian side put forth a draft version of the cooperation 
agreement, including the point that the main objective of the 
"partnership for peace" is to cooperate to solve crises, calm 
down conflicts, arrange peace-keeping actions, and establish an 
effective mechanism for maintaining European security and 
stability, with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe playing a major role. Russia also proposed that 
cooperation be carried out in the fields of preventing nuclear 
proliferation, preventing possible new nuclear threats, shifting 
the war industry to civilian production, coordinating the 
production of new weapons, fighting terrorism, and advancing 
disarmament and arms control. This showed that the new 
developments in NATO-Russian relations would have a far-reaching 
influence on the security pattern in Europe -- and in the world 
as a whole -- as well as on relations between various countries.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wan Chengcai] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, June 27 (XINHUA) -- Compared with the 
upheavals Russia has seen in the past two years, the political 
situation of the country can be said stable, which could help 
propel Russia's economic reconstruction and reforms it vitally 
needs. 
  The stability is shown in the following fields: 
  -- The relations between the republics-regions and the 
federal authorities have improved. 
  -- The inflation rate has been lowered and contained, and 
market's role has increased, although the economic situation 
remains bleak. 
  -- The former relationship of confrontation between the 
parliament and the government has been turned into one of 
dialogue. The parliament and President Boris Yeltsin are 
settling their differences by cooperation and coordination. 
  -- The Civic Accord signed in late April has restricted any 
political party from resorting to actions that might violate the 
constitution and other laws concerned. 
  In February, tension between the lower house of parliament, 
or State Duma, and Yeltsin was defused after the leaders of the 
1991 "August 19 incident" and former lawmakers involved in the 
October uprising were freed. Yeltsin first opposed the amnesty 
resolution of the State Duma. 
  Yeltsin now has regular meetings with parliament speakers 
and 
the prime minister. He also has frequent meetings with leaders 
of the major political parties of the country. 
  After the State Duma and Yeltsin called for national 
reconciliation and concentration on economic recovery and 
development, the Civic Accord was signed last April. 
  The accord calls for dialogue, consultation, negotiation to 
seek a common ground and a reasonable compromise in the 
settlement of the country's problems. 
  The accord also voices strong opposition to political 
confrontation and violence. 
  Thanks to the accord, there are no more large-scale street 
protest rallies and demonstrations that could trigger violence, 
and Yeltsin said earlier this month that the opposition is now 
resorting to peaceful political activities. 
  Meanwhile, the federal authorities signed a treaty with the 
once secessionist Republic of Tatarstan in February. Last month 
Yeltsin visited the republic and worked out a mechanism to 
implement the treaty with local leaders. 
  Yeltsin is going to sign similar treaties with other 
republics and regions. 
  Recently Yeltsin made a sharp departure from his refusal to 
have direct dialogue with Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
whose republic has declared independence. 
  Except Chechen all the republics and regions have been 
represented in the Federation Council (the upper house), making 
the chances of division of Russia remote. 
  In the economic sphere, the Russian Government has managed 
to 
contain the monthly inflation rate to below 10 percent from a 
level of 20 to 25 percent of two years ago. 
  Yeltsin recently signed 20 decrees to encourage investments 
and promote production, much to the welcome of the population. 
  At the end of last year Russia adopted a new constitution 
under which a presidential government was formed and a new 
broad-based parliament elected. 
  The new government and parliament reshaped the home and 
foreign policies to some extent. 
  Gradual reforms, appropriate state control and social 
security have replaced radical "shock therapies" in reforms. 
  In its foreign policy, the government attaches importance to 
protecting national interests and restoring Russia's status as a 
big power. 
  Analysts also said that although Russia now enjoys a 
relative 
stability, uncertainties are still around. 
  Industrial production in the first six months of this year 
has dropped by 28 percent compared with the same period of last 
year, a lot of factories are out of operation, unemployment and 
crime are increasing, and one half of the population are living 
near or below the poverty line.

  [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton said here today that the United States needs a new 
policy in dealing with Africa's problems. 
  "With all the problems and all the terrible things that are 
happening and all the economic backsliding which has occurred, 
there is a lot of hope in Africa," Clinton said in a speech to a 
White House conference on Africa. 
  The two-day white house conference on Africa, which began on 
Sunday [26 June], brought together 150 experts from government 
agencies, think tanks and universities to seek new approaches to 
dealing with Africa's problems. 
  Clinton asked all participants "to help us to develop an 
American constituency for Africa that creates lasting links 
between our people and their people." 
  The President said Americans' knowledge of Africa "is pretty 
low, except when something horrible happens and then it just 
cuts through our hearts and it seems so overwhelming that we 
can't do anything about it." 
  "But I do know we need a new policy," Clinton said. "I do 
believe Africa matters to America." 
  Clinton told the participants that the most important thing 
he could do in the aftermath of this conference is "to do 
whatever the president can do to develop that constituency, to 
explain to American people, of whatever race, region or 
background, why Africa matters to all of us and to our common 
future." 
  "Let's build a constituency. Let's remind people there are 
things to hope about, as well as things to fear," he said.

  [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
has moved some of the staff at its liaison office in Mogadishu 
to Nairobi, Kenya, because of the security consideration, the 
State Department said here today. 
  "In Nairobi they will continue to work on Somali issues," 
department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters at a news 
briefing. 
  "There is a small number of essential personnel who remain 
behind in Mogadishu to carry out a lot of the necessary work we 
do in liaison with the U.N. mission," McCurry said. 
  Since Thursday, there have been some serious inter-clan 
fightings in Mogadishu between the Aidid faction on one side and 
a coalition of clans on the other side, according to the 
spokesman. 
  Over the weekend, some of the gun battles occurred in areas 
directly adjacent to the U.N. mission compound in Mogadishu. 
  "The compound was not the target of any of the fighting that 
occurred over the weekend," McCurry said, "but stray rounds have 
hit the compound, resulting in some injuries," that included a 
U.S. civilian working for a U.N. contractor in Somalia. 
  There are some reports that there have been some resumption 
of shelling in Mogadishu today. 
  The United States has also issued a very strong travel 
warning, urging American citizens not to travel to Somalia.

  [Text] Washington, June 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
Administration today expressed its regrets over Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to resign. 
  White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that 
"President Clinton and Prime Minister Hata enjoyed a good 
working relationship." 
  "We regret the decision" by Hata to offer his resignation, 
Myers said in a statement. 
  Hata announced this morning on June 25 that he and his 
cabinet will resign to avoid defeat in a parliamentary vote of 
no confidence. 
  His announcement came less than an hour before the 
parliament 
was scheduled to open debate on a no-confidence motion that 
appeared likely to carry. 
  Myers said that "the United States will continue to work 
closely with the Government of Japan as only allies and friends 
can at a moment of political change."

  [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton announced top level shakeups of the White House this 
afternoon, appointing White House management and budget director 
Leon Panetta to replace Mack McLarty as the White House chief of 
staff. 
  Announcing the shakeups in his Oval Office at the White 
House, Clinton named Ms. Alice Rivlin, deputy director of the 
White House Office of Management and Budget, to succeed Panetta, 
becoming the first woman to head the White House Office of 
Management and Budget. 
  David Gergen, a White House senior adviser, would move to 
the 
U.S. State Department as a special adviser to both President 
Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  McLarty, Clinton's lifelong friend, has been widely 
criticized as "too nice" to be effective. 
  Speaking from his Oval Office, Clinton said the shakeups 
were 
first suggested by McLarty who would remain a senior counselor 
to the President. 
  Clinton said McLarty "has been and will continue to be most 
closest and most trusted personal adviser," taking greater 
responsibility in promoting the administration's agenda on 
capital hill. 
  No one in Washington has a better understanding of both ends 
of Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House and Congress) than Leon 
Panetta, Clinton said of his new chief of staff. 
  In his brief remarks at the announcement, Panetta known as a 
deficit hawk signaled a wider shakeups, saying that "changes 
will be made in consultation with the President." 
  David Gergen, a former Republican adviser who joined the 
White House staff a year ago to help deal with a spate of 
negative publicity, made clear, however, that he doesn't intend 
to remain long in the administration. 
  Clinton made the changes as debate heated up on his health 
care proposal and as the dollar came under intense pressure on 
world currency markets, observers here said. 
  The changes also come at a time when Clinton's approval 
ratings are declining. A recent poll said only 42 percent of 
Americans gave the President a positive rating, they noted.

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column article by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 </F>
3768): "U.S., Russian Navies' Joint Exercise at Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] The U.S. and Russian navies held joint military 
maneuvers in the Slavyanskiy Bay [si la bi yang si ji wan 2448 
2139 3024 2254 2448 1015 3494] near Vladivostok, in the Russian 
Far Eastern region, from 20 to 21 June. Participating in this 
operation were, on the Russian side, 180 officers and soldiers 
from the Russian Pacific fleet, and a large-to-medium sized 
landing fleet; and on the U.S. side, 250 Marines and a number of 
warships, including helicopter carriers and landing ships. The 
U.S. and Russian navies' joining forces with each other no doubt 
has drawn the world's attention. 
  The U.S.-Russian joint military exercises were a simulated 
joint operation conducted by the two navies in order to carry 
out joint disaster relief missions in cases of natural disaster, 
such as an earthquake or flood, that might take place somewhere 
in the world. For this reason, both sides deployed landing 
ships, helicopters, and amphibious tanks to conduct the military 
exercises. The landing site was the Keleierke [0344 7191 1422 
0344] Peninsula, 50 km to the south of Vladivostok. Both U.S. 
and Russian Marines carried out antidisaster and 
personnel-rescue exercises. 
  This joint military maneuver was carried out according to 
some provisions of the U.S.-Russian memorandum on military 
cooperation which was signed last September. Although the 
central task of this military maneuver was confined to 
disaster-fighting missions, it was, after all, a joint military 
operation run by the two military superpowers, an event that 
would have been absolutely unimaginable in the past. 
<H5>  The Two Superpowers Each Have Their Own Purposes in Military </H5>
Cooperation 
  Russia has been facing numerous economic difficulties 
following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, but it remains 
a world-class military superpower. To be sure, this military 
maneuver was focused on joint disaster-fighting operations, but 
it still created an impression to the world that the two 
military superpowers are intending to join forces to dominate 
the world or to intervene in regional affairs when necessary. 
Russia itself does hope to work together with the United States 
and have a say in world affairs, as the United States does. 
Referring to the Korean nuclear issue, the United States 
recently pledged to press the Security Council to impose 
economic sanctions. In response to this, Russia reproached the 
United States for failure to consult it beforehand, and 
therefore it expressed discontent with the United States and 
voiced objection to the U.S. action. Russia's purpose is to 
fight for a say in world affairs which is equal to that enjoyed 
by the United States. 
  Following the end of the Cold War, the world situation has 
been developing in a diversified manner. As far as diplomacy is 
concerned, Clinton has frequently flaunted his "strength," but 
the U.S. strength is not equal to its ambition. Either its 
hard-line diplomacy or tactic of using military force is 
ineffective in many cases -- in the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil 
war, the Somali rebellion, the Rwanda civil war, the Haiti coups 
d'etat, and the Korean nuclear issue, for instance. The United 
States has been facing criticism, both at home and abroad, 
throughout the process of military intervention in Somali, from 
the deployment of U.S. troops to the pullout from the country. 
  Being busy dealing with the economic crisis, today's Russia 
is much less influential than the Soviet Union of the past. As 
civil war burst out in the former Yugoslavia, the West 
repeatedly urged Russia to play a leading part in pressuring the 
militarily aggressive Serbs, but so far the West's appeals have 
been to no avail. 
<H5>  The United States and Russia Are To Jointly Explore Space </H5>
Technology 
  Both military superpowers are experiencing a decline in 
their 
control over and influence in the world. Both sides wish to 
cooperate and support each other to seek a greater say in world 
affairs. 
  On 21 June, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev announced that 
Russia and the United States would jointly propose to the 
Security Council a bill on easing the nuclear crisis on the 
Korea Peninsula. This bill consists of a proposal to call an 
international conference and a scheme of stage-by-stage 
sanctions against Korea. The only new point in this bill lies 
in that it is a "U.S.-Russian cooperation project." 
  The United States and Russia also have decided to step up 
scientific and technological cooperation in the areas of space 
exploration and environmental protection. As scheduled, Russian 
Premier Chernomyrdin, who will be on a visit to the United 
States, will attend an accord-signing ceremony on 23 June, by 
which the United States will join the space development plan to 
be run on Russia's Mir space station. 
  "U.S.-Russian cooperation" may be extended to other fields 
in 
the future. It can be beneficial to both sides, and it also can 
be used, when necessary, to demonstrate to the world the 
intention of the United States and Russia to dominate the world, 
both militarily and politically.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 27 (XINHUA) -- A top trade union 
leader today urged all overseas-funded enterprises in China to 
set up trade unions to protect the legal rights of their workers 
and better solve problems between labor and management. 
  "Such organizations will not only help protect the legal 
rights of workers, but also promote cooperation between 
employees and employers, and be conducive to the prosperity of 
the enterprises," Zhang Dinghua said. 
  Zhang, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions, was speaking at an on-going national work conference on 
trade unions in foreign enterprises held in the capital city of 
north China's Hebei Province. 
  Trade unions in overseas-funded enterprises numbered 8,200 
by 
the end of 1993, taking in more than 1.32 million members, 
according to Zhang. 
  He said that most overseas enterprises with trade unions 
abide by Chinese laws and regulations in protecting the rights 
of their employees and achieve good economic results due to 
harmonious labor relations. 
  "However, some serious problems still remain," Zhang said, 
noting that some small manufacturers neglect safety in 
production, and some overseas investors force workers into 
unreasonable overwork and then underpay them. 
  "Some even treat employees in a disrespectful and illegal 
manner," he said. 
  In November last year, 84 woman workers were burned to death 
in a fire in a Shenzhen toy-making factory run by a Hong Kong 
businessman, because all the exits were closed for fear the 
workers might steal his toys. 
  One month later, 62 workers were killed in a 
Taiwanese-invested factory in Fujian Province for the same 
reason. 
  Zhang stressed that trade unions play an indispensable role 
in protecting laborers' rights and adjusting laborer-employer 
relations in ways that other organizations can not. 
  But only 12 percent of the overseas-funded enterprises in 
China have trade union organizations, Zhang said. 
  "Overseas-funded enterprises, especially those in 
development 
zones and coastal cities, must establish trade unions in their 
enterprises by the end of this year," Zhang pronounced, reading 
from a recent decree by the State Council. 
  "From now on, such enterprises must establish trade unions 
in 
order to open for business, and the deadline is one year from 
the start of business," the decree said. 
  Zhang called for the legislature to issue laws and 
regulations on the protections of laborers' rights and set up 
relevant supervisory bodies to ensure that they are observed. 
  Zhang said his federation will also help township 
enterprises 
in the countryside to establish trade unions. 
  Some 400,000 township enterprises have already met the 
requirements for setting up trade unions for their 25 million 
workers. But not more than 5 percent of the enterprises have 
trade unions and less than 8 percent of workers have 
memberships, Zhang said.

  [Text] Taiyuan, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Loans from 
international financial organizations and governments are used 
in control of water and atmospheric pollution in Shanxi 
Province, one of the most important energy and chemical industry 
centers in China. 
  With the approval of the State Council, the province plans 
to 
construct five intensive heating and coal gas projects to reduce 
air pollution. It has asked for loans from the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB). At present, the 120 million U.S. dollar 
loan has been listed among the ADB's reserve projects for 1996. 
  The five projects involve three big industrial cities in the 
province -- Taiyuan, Datong and Yangquan. They will provide 
residents with heating and coal gas and will greatly improve the 
atmospheric environment of the three cities. 
  The scheme will cut out the release of 21,800 tons of 
sulphur 
dioxide and 50,900 tons of dust and smoke every year. It will 
also save the consumption of 1.19 million tons of coal annually. 
  The main industries in Shanxi are coal mining, electricity, 
metallurgy and chemical industry, which are all pollution 
intensive industries. 
  Shanxi is rich in coal but severely short of water. Much of 
the water the province does have is heavily polluted. The 
control of water pollution is the key aim in using foreign 
investment. 
  A loan from the French Government amounting to 4.95 million 
U.S. dollars is expected to be used in control of polluted water 
in Yangquan city. Another joint project in disposal of waste 
water containing nitrogen is under negotiation between Shanxi 
Fertilizer Factory and Germany. 
  The head of the Environment Protection Bureau of Shanxi said 
that the use of foreign funds in environmental protection would 
not only solve the problem of money, but also introduce advanced 
technical equipment and scientific management methods.

<F P=106> ["Round-up" by Wang Nan: "World Airline and Aircraft </F>
Industry Turns Upbeat"] 
  [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- After four years of 
losses, the prospects for the world airlines and aircraft making 
industry are turning upbeat. 
  Optimism was at first seen in increased plane orders, such 
as 
the five billion dollars order from Saudi Arabia, 10 billion 
dollars order from Singapore Airlines, and possible purchases 
from China. 
  The world's 224 airlines are expected to garner a profit of 
one billion dollars this year, representing one percent of total 
sales, after losing 15.6 billion dollars since 1990, according 
to the latest forecast. 
  The International Air Transport Association (IATA), based in 
Geneva, reported that in the first quarter of this year, world 
passenger traffic grew nine percent, and freight traffic grew 12 
percent. 
  IATA saw a 7.4 percent growth in scheduled passenger and 
freight traffic service in 1993, and expected 8.9 percent growth 
this year. 
  Every one billion profit of the world airlines, as is the 
case this year, observers said, translates into a cash flow of 
three billion dollars, the down payment for 30 billion dollars 
of plane orders. 
  Worldwide deliveries of commercial passenger jets of 100 
seats or more, which plummeted to less than 600 in 1993, is 
expected to reach more than 700 in the late 1990s, boeing said 
in its latest forecast. 
  The European Airbus Industrie, with worldwide market share 
at 
25 percent, predicted that the world's new orders of passenger 
planes, which were less than 100 in 1993, will reach 200 this 
year. 
  The reasons for the cautious optimism, according to 
observers, included the recent restructuring drive by many 
airlines, which have significantly reduced their unit costs and 
improved productivity. 
  The spate of alliances among major carriers, meanwhile, have 
enabled them to knock down old-time government barriers and 
expand routes into foreign territories. 
  Other reasons, observers said, range from more privatization 
of government-owned airlines across the world, to moderate 
economic growth in the industrial world, and declining fuel 
prices and interest rates.

"Practical Significance of Upholding the Five Principles of 
Peaceful Coexistence"] 
  [Text] This year is the 40th anniversary of the 
proclamation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence 
jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma. Practice over the 
past 40 years proves that the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence conform to the needs of the times and to the reality 
of world development, and therefore they are winning support and 
approval from more and more countries and they have become 
universally accepted basic principles for handling international 
relations. 
  Advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence 
was a great beginning in the history of international relations 
and was a new development of the basic principles of 
international law in the post-war situation. The basic 
principles of modern international law came into existence in 
the bourgeois revolutionary period and were the embodiment of 
the will of the bourgeoisie. The principle of sovereignty and 
the spirit of equality they reflected did not take into account 
the vast numbers of colonies and semi-colonial countries. They 
served the old international order, which was based on power 
politics, and had fundamental limitations. Since the Second 
World War, there have been profound changes in international 
relations. Following the upsurge of national liberation 
movements, the vast numbers of Third World countries that had 
newly won independence went onto the international arena, thus 
having a great impact on the international order dominated by 
major powers. In order to safeguard their national independence 
and develop their national economies, Third World countries 
opposed all forms of hegemonism and power politics in 
international relations, called for the establishment of a new 
form of international relations on the foundation of 
independence and equality, and hoped for some basic principles 
to standardize this type of new international relations. 
Advocacy of the five principles of peaceful coexistence was 
precisely the reflection of the demand and aspiration. 
The five principles of peaceful coexistence have 
developed the spirit of the UN Charter in light of the post-war 
reality and have concisely and clearly summed up the basic 
principles that must be observed in modern international 
relations. They provide that all rights and obligations are 
premised by the principle of reciprocity and have an equal 
binding force on countries with different social systems and at 
different stages of development. Moreover, their content 
embraces political and economic aspects and form a complete 
whole. Therefore, we can say that the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence are a manifesto of Third World countries 
that call for the establishment of a fair and rational new 
international order. Their advocacy marked the beginning of a 
new period in the history of international relations. In 
past decades, in order to promote the establishment of a new 
international order, Third World countries have made unremitting 
efforts, struggles, and great progress, changing the face of 
post-war international relations to an exceedingly large degree. 
  Since the end of the Second World War, a number of socialist 
and nationalist countries have appeared, ushering in the 
coexistence of the two social systems of socialism and 
capitalism and of socialist, capitalist, and nationalist 
countries. The advocacy of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence and development of the international situation show 
that peaceful coexistence is not only needed for countries with 
different social systems, but likewise needed between socialist 
countries. Only when all countries, despite their power, 
strength, wealth, ideologies, and social systems respect each 
other's sovereignty, treat each other equally, and coexist 
peacefully can the world have lasting peace and prosperity. In 
light of the new characteristics in the post-war international 
situation and the new practice in international relations, the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence have developed into 
general principles fit for use by all countries, thus greatly 
enriching and developing the idea of peaceful coexistence. 
  Since the end of the Cold War, the world has had 
profound changes and is faced with many problems, so upholding 
the five principles of peaceful coexistence in international 
relations has greater significance. Mutual respect for 
sovereignty is the core and foundation of the five 
principles. The equality of all countries, big and small, 
the inviolability of territorial integrity, and 
non-interference in the internal affairs of another country all 
derive from the principle of sovereignty. The principle of 
sovereignty is also the cornerstone of the UN Charter. 
Safeguarding sovereignty and infringing on sovereignty 
have always been a focal point in international relations. 
Since the end of the Cold War, international struggles 
centering on the question of sovereignty have become 
increasingly conspicuous. Major Western countries, taking 
advantage of changes in international political and economic 
relations, pursue "neo-interventionism," advocate that the 
concept of sovereignty is "outmoded," and that "human rights are 
superior to sovereignty" in an attempt to achieve the goal of 
harming the sovereignty of medium and small countries and 
interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries 
through playing down the principle of sovereignty. This 
practice has seriously endangered the normal development of 
international relations. There is no denying the fact that 
there have been profound changes in the world's political and 
economic situations today. Due to the exceedingly speedy 
development of science and technology, the world has already 
greatly "shrunk," economic interdependence is increasingly 
deepening, activities across national borders are getting 
increasingly brisk, and the common problems faced by humans are 
increasing. Under the circumstances, it is completely necessary 
for more extensive cooperation between nations and for the 
international community to take more common action. For this 
reason, in safeguarding their own interests, sovereign countries 
must at the same time consider the interests of other countries 
and the common interests of humanity. But this does not mean 
the principle of sovereignty has changed. Under the unfair 
international order, strong countries always impose their will 
on weak ones, harming their sovereignty. While advocating such 
views as sovereignty being "outmoded," major Western powers in 
fact do not limit their own sovereignty, but only call for 
limiting the sovereignty of other countries. Today as the 
economies of the world are getting increasingly integrated, 
developed countries are not really keen on solving the problem 
of poverty which has a bearing on the whole world. On the 
contrary, they are strengthening protection of their own 
economies and limitations on immigrants. On the other hand, 
major Western countries often use as an excuse the universal 
principle of human rights to flagrantly interfere in some 
developing countries and demand that they accept Western values, 
social systems, and economic patterns. This practice is in fact 
a manifestation of power politics under the new post-Cold-War 
situation. International reality proves that although the 
international situation is greatly different from in the past, 
the independence of countries and the equality with which all 
countries handle international relations still remain unchanged. 
Sticking to the five principles, safeguarding national 
sovereignty, and opposing interference in the internal affairs 
of another country in any form are still very important in 
guaranteeing the normal development of international relations, 
in promoting international peace and cooperation, and 
particularly in protecting the just rights and interests of vast 
numbers of developing countries. 
  The five principles of peaceful coexistence came into 
existence at the high tide of the national independence movement 
in the 1950's. At that time, they mainly stressed independence 
and sovereignty in national relations, but also applied to the 
economic field calling for equality and mutual benefits in 
international economic relations. The economic imbalance 
between South and North has long been serious, and many 
developing countries are faced with social turbulence and 
economic stagnation. There are of course internal reasons for 
this, but a more important one is the seriously unequal 
relations in the international economy. The worsening of trade 
terms, the low prices of primary products, the heavy debt 
burden, and the prevalence of protectionism and supraeconomic 
pressure have seriously hampered the economic development of 
developing countries. Developing countries strongly call for 
the establishment of a fair and rational new international 
order. Since the end of the Cold War, the influence of the 
economic factor on international relations has obviously 
increased, and therefore upholding mutual respect for 
sovereignty and the principle of equality and mutual benefit has 
more conspicuous significance. Today as countries around 
the world are getting increasingly interdependent and as the 
global problems they face are increasing, developed countries 
and developing countries should make concerted efforts and 
strengthen cooperation and exchanges on the basis of mutual 
respect for sovereignty and equality and reciprocity. Only this 
is beneficial to world peace and development. Due to historical 
and practical reasons, developed countries have an unshirkable 
responsibility for narrowing the gap between South and North and 
improving the unfavorable position of developing countries in 
the world economy and trade. Developed countries should offer 
necessary preferential conditions to developing countries in 
respect to economic aid, technology transfer, and trade, and 
should completely abandon the incorrect practice of attaching 
political conditions to trade and economic aid. 
  Since the end of the Cold War, the world has been 
developing into a multipolar one at an accelerated rate. The 
five principles will play a bigger role in safeguarding world 
peace and promoting development. Multipolarization means 
superpowers can no longer dominate the world. Since the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, the strength of the United 
States as a superpower has relatively weakened and it finds it 
impossible to maintain "one-power domination." The imbalanced 
development of the world's politics and economy makes the 
strength of major powers tend to be balanced. The economic 
strength and political status of West Europe and Japan are 
rising. Russia's status in the world's strategic pattern and 
its influence on world affairs must not be neglected. Some 
developing countries, especially some large countries and 
regional groups, have been developing comparatively quickly by 
seizing the favorable opportunity of the world's economic 
readjustment and have become an important new force in the 
multipolar world. The multipolar development of the 
world's politics and economy offers an historical opportunity 
and extensive objective foundation for implementing the spirit 
of the five principles in international relations. The policy 
of hegemonism and power politics pursued by superpowers will be 
more strongly opposed. Any practice of disregarding the 
sovereignty of another country and imposing one's ideology on 
another is impractical. 
  The current transition of the world's old pattern to a new 
one has afforded an opportunity for world peace and development. 
Sticking to the five principles can help resolve problems faced 
by the world today and establish a fair and rational new 
international order people have long been looking forward to. 
Times are progressing and theories have to be developed. 
Compared with the Cold War period, the present transition 
period from the old pattern to a new one has many new 
characteristics and still needs to be understood through 
practice. However, as basic principles guiding international 
relations, the five principles of peaceful coexistence still 
indisputably possess strong vitality.

"The Light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence Will 
Shine Forever"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Jun (XINHUA) -- The 40th anniversary of 
the promulgation of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 
which was jointly initiated by China, India and Myanmar [Burma], 
falls in June this year. The five principles are: mutual 
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual 
nonaggression, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. 
After 40 years of tests in practice, the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence have shown strong vitality and become a 
universally-acknowledged basic norm governing relations among 
nations. 
  After World War II, national independence and liberation 
movements flourished vigorously in Asia, Africa, and Latin 
America. Newly independent countries were in urgent need of a 
new international relationship based on equality to defend 
national sovereignty and develop their national economies. The 
five principles of peaceful coexistence had emerged precisely to 
meet such a strong common aspiration of the newly independent 
countries. 
  China and India, two giants in Asia, established diplomatic 
relations on 1 April 1950 after their rebirths. On 29 April 
1954, China and India signed an "agreement between the People's 
Republic of China and the Republic of India on trade and 
communications between China's Tibet region and India," and the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence were introduced for the 
first time into the preface of the agreement. In June 1954, 
Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and Burma at the invitation of 
the two countries and successively held talks with Indian Prime 
Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. The five 
principles of peaceful coexistence were officially announced as 
the basic norms for guiding bilateral relations in both the 
"joint statement of Chinese and Indian prime ministers" issued 
on 28 June 1954 and the "joint statement of Chinese and Burmese 
prime ministers" issued on 29 June 1954. The Sino-Indian joint 
statement proposed that "these principles not only be applicable 
to relations between nations, but also to international 
relations in general." The Sino-Burmese joint statement hoped 
that "these principles will be observed by all countries." 
  In April 1955, the year after China, India, and Burma 
initiated the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 29 newly 
independent countries from Asia and Africa held the historic 
Asian-African Conference in Bangdung, Indonesia. With concerted 
efforts made by the representatives of various countries, the 
conference adopted the "declaration on promotion of world peace 
and cooperation" and formulated the ten principles of the 
Bangdung Conference. These 10 principles, which contained all 
five of the principles of peaceful coexistence, represented an 
extension and development of the latter. Since then, the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence have been recognized and 
accepted by more and more nations, international organizations, 
and international meetings; and have been incorporated into a 
series of major international documents, including declarations 
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The five 
principles were also reaffirmed in the documents on China's 
establishment of diplomatic relations with more than 100 
nations, including Western countries like the United States, and 
in treaties as well as communiques China has signed with other 
countries. 
  The world today is characterized by diversity. There are 
about 1,000 ethnic nationalities and more than 200 countries, 
including more than 180 independent, sovereign nations. They 
differ not only in social systems and development levels, but 
also in ideology, cultural heritage, national character, and 
religious belief. The practice of many years has proved that 
whenever a few countries in disregard of the said differences 
tried stubbornly to impose their values on "democracy" and 
"human rights" as well as their social systems on other 
countries, there would invariably be unrest and chaos, making 
such practice utterly futile. Similarly, contradictions would 
be intensified and international tensions heightened if the 
modes of "big family," "bloc politics," "sphere of influence" 
and "world leadership" were applied in handling international 
relations. With the end of the Cold War, there is no more bloc 
confrontation characterized by the contention for hegemony 
between the two superpowers. However, manifestations of power 
politics still exist in international relations, marked by the 
big suppressing the small, the strong bullying the weak, 
interference in others' internal affairs under various excuses, 
and frequent threats to apply sanctions and even to use force. 
Therefore, it is still of paramount and realistic significance 
to actively advocate and apply the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence in handling international relations. 
  The five principles of peaceful coexistence, transcending 
the limits of social system and ideology, have generalized the 
most basic norms that govern international relations. Only when 
international relations are completely based on the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence; the differences between 
nations are duly recognized and respected; all nations, big or 
small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are recognized as equals in 
the international community with the right to choose their own 
ideology, social system, and the mode of development suitable 
for them; and mutual exchange, seeking of common grounds and 
keeping of differences, as well as complementary exchange are 
encouraged, can the nations co-exist peacefully and enjoy 
genuine peace, stability and development. 
  In order to promote peace and development, a peaceful, 
stable, just, and equitable new international political and 
economic order should be established on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence and on the premise of 
recognizing the diversity of the world and differences between 
nations. Under such a new order, mutual respect, equality, and 
cooperation between nations will take the place of hegemonism 
and power politics; negotiations and dialogue will replace the 
use and the threat of the use of force; and equality, mutual 
benefit, and complementary exchange will substitute for trade 
protectionism and unequal exchange. To achieve these ends, the 
international community needs to cooperate extensively and make 
long-term and unremitting efforts.
