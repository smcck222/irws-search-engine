  [Text] According to a report from Kompong Cham Province, 
hundreds of Vietnamese families are grabbing land belonging to 
Cambodians on the upper and lower parts of the Kompong Cham port. 
  The Cambodian landowners there said they first saw 10 to 20 
Vietnamese boats anchoring along the river banks near the port. 
A few days later, they saw many more Vietnamese boats anchoring 
along the river banks. Some small huts were also being built on 
the river banks. 
  When the landowners told them to get out off their land, 
these Vietnamese said they were not settling on these lands and 
that they would be leaving after staying there for a few days. 
Our people then returned home. 
  Two weeks later, the Vietnamese boat people went ashore and 
built hundreds of huts on the river banks. They do everything, 
including selling goods, fishing, and prostitution. 
  Seeing this, the landowners went to drive the Vietnamese off 
their land. This time, the Vietnamese replied that the 
Cambodian authorities had given them permission to settle there. 
The Cambodian people complained to the ward authorities, but no 
measures were taken to settle this problem. The people then 
went to complain to the provincial authorities. But Hun Neng, 
elder brother of one-eyed Hun Sen, who has been installed by the 
Vietnamese as Kompong Cham provincial governor, threatened the 
people against doing anything to harm the fraternal Vietnamese 
and Vietnamese-Cambodian solidarity. 
  The people were very angry with this statement by Hun Neng. 
They said he and all his colleagues are Vietnamese lackeys who 
only defend the Vietnamese while oppressing the Cambodians. The 
people said that they must not rely on the Vietnamese lackeys 
any longer; they must solve the problem of Vietnamese 
land-grabbing by themselves; they must not allow the Vietnamese 
to grab their land; and that they will take action against Hun 
Neng later.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment" column: "Respect Thy Neighbor"] </F>
  [Text] International standards of neighboring behavior 
require sovereign nations to respect one another and not to 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, near or 
far. Of course, with Thailand this is always different, unless 
they themselves are the `victim' of neighborly meddling in their 
own internal affairs. 
  So armed with the usual double standards, the Thais continue 
to meddle and flex their muscles in the internal affairs of 
Cambodia, their favorite `weak' neighbor. 
  A recent glaring example of this affair is when General 
Charan Kunlawanit, head of Thai National Security Council, 
embroiled himself in Cambodia's internal affairs when he 
dispatched a diplomatic note warning Australian foreign Minister 
Gareth Evans to reject His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's plea 
for military aid for the Kingdom of Cambodia. General Charan 
apparently argued that aid would expose Cambodia as a puppet of 
the West. 
  The question about what General Charan's role is in this 
matter has turned out to be an interesting one. Never mine that 
the Khmer Rouge has all this time received support from certain 
segments of the Thai military, which makes them to be puppets of 
Thailand. This turn of events is highly suprising for a man who 
personally vetoed a U.S. request last year for permission to put 
up aerial reconnaisance to monitor Khmer Rouge movements along 
the Thai border, as reported in the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW. 
General Charan's neutrality is of course a foregone conclusion, 
especially in light of his comments to the BANGKOK POST a year 
earlier, when he said Thailand would "be crazy" to sever ties 
with the Khmer Rouge. 
  The rebels "share the same fence as ours. Boycott them and 
we endanger our own being" the good general said. 
  Naturally, General Charan is not representative of the whole 
of Thailand, but what is clear is that Thailand is not in too 
much of a hurry to see Indochina, especially Cambodia's 
in-fighting stamped out -- not if Thailand stands to gain from 
another long, drawn out war. 
  And so the Thai comedy plays on.

    [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in 
Cambodian on 4 June carries the following reports in its 
business section: 
  Concerning the domestic transportation of timber, the paper 
says that 30 barges carrying processed wood to Phnom Penh have 
been stranded at the Kratie provincial port for nearly a month 
because the province's Department of Forestry and Wildlife has 
refused to issue a permit. No reason has been given. The paper 
calls on the department to explain its action, saying that the 
government has not banned the transportation of processed wood 
for local use and that the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
Wildlife, and Fisheries has even taken bids for the exploitation 
of 29 forest lots across the country. Citing the extra fees 
that the timber merchants are forced to pay because of the ban, 
the paper calls on the department to announce future 
transportation bans in advance. 
  In a report on the privatization of state-owned factories, 
the paper says that of the 59 factories put into operation since 
1979, 42 have been rented, 10 have been sold to the local 
private sector and foreign investors, and seven remain under 
government control. The paper cites the director of the Industry 
Ministry's Planning Department as saying that many businessmen 
are interested in renting the remaining seven factories, but are 
hesitant because of the many preconditions and problems. For 
example, they must hire all of the current workers in each 
factory and do not have the right to fire any of them, even if 
they break the rules or refuse to work. Also, they need to 
renovate and modify the factories and the machines -- which are 
not in good condition -- but the import of spare parts is time 
consuming and involves many procedures. 
  On the destruction of Cambodia's forests, the paper blames 
the government for granting logging concessions to foreign 
companies. It says that although a log export ban has been in 
effect since 30 March 1994, many foreign companies are still 
cutting Cambodian trees and transporting logs out of the 
forests. As an example, it cites a joint venture between 
Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore located at Prek Prasap Leu 
village in Prek Prasap District of Kratie Province. The paper 
says the government and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
Wildlife, and Fisheries might not know about the activities of 
this company because even the Kratie provincial governor and 
Prek Prasap District governor have pretended not to hear about 
it. About 40,000 cubic meters of logs already cut by this 
company are being transported out of the province. Forestry 
officials have revealed that after the government imposed the 
log export ban, the company stored logs temporarily at Prek 
Phnoeu and is looking for other ways to get the logs out of 
Cambodia. The company plans to export a total of 90,000 cubic 
meters of logs in the 1993-94 period.

  [Text] At a news conference after the cabinet meeting on 7 
June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa commented on the possible 
ban on North Koreans in Japan making remittances to their home 
country, a move which is being considered as part of economic 
sanctions against the DRPK over the issue of its suspected 
development of nuclear arms. 
  He said: "Similar cases in the past have provided for some 
exceptions on humanitarian grounds." He indicated that if 
sanctions were be imposed, some exceptions would be provided on 
humanitarian grounds.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 8 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 7 June, the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] issued a statement by Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
criticizing the government's position paper submitted to the 
International Court of Justice which expresses the view that 
"the use of nuclear weapons does not violate international law." 
The statement claims the use of nuclear arms "is a violation of 
international law, and runs counter to humanism." 
  Sakigake [Harbinger Party], Group Seiun, and Minshu no Kaze 
[Wind of Democracy] also issued an emergency statement, saying: 
"From the standpoint of the only atomic-bombed country in the 
world, Japan should actively argue the use of nuclear arms is 
highly illegal." All parties strongly demand that the 
government revise the position paper. 
  Murayama's statement, quoting the 1961 UN General Assembly 
Resolution banning the use of nuclear weapons, emphasizes: 
"Nuclear arms are weapons of indiscriminate, mass destruction 
which affect even noncombatants. The illegality of using such 
weapons is evident under existing international treaties." 
  The statement further points out: 1) Such a position is an 
affront to the sentiments of atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki, and to the Japanese people who demand the 
extinction of nuclear weapons; and 2) a negative attitude on the 
nuclear issue will seriously jeopardize the legitimacy of 
Japanese diplomacy at a time when the DPRK's (North Korea) 
suspected development of nuclear devices is a burning issue. It 
asks the government to reconsider its position. 
  The statement issued by Sakigake and the other groups says: 
"To claim this is not illegal merely because there are no 
actual provisions on it in international law is inappropriate in 
view of ongoing efforts to gradually institutionalize 
international law to adapt to the needs of the times." 
  The "Goken Liberal no Kai [Liberals' Association for 
Safeguarding the Constitution]" in the House of Councillors also 
criticized the government's position paper for "having no 
international sense at all." It has issued a statement asking 
that the document be rescinded.

  [Text] Regarding the operation of Japanese fishing boats 
in the waters around the Kuril Islands, the Japanese Government 
has started considering working out a bilateral treaty with 
Russia that would allow Japanese fishing boats to operate in the 
area by paying fishing fees to the Russian Government. Local 
authorities of Russia's Southern Kurils regional administration 
originally proposed the idea of the "fishing fees system" to the 
authorities of Nemuro city in Hokkaido, but the Japanese 
Government has so far opposed it, saying that it would lead to 
Japan's acknowledging Russia's illegal seizure of the northern 
territories. However, Russian authorities, among other 
measures, have strengthened a crackdown on violations in the 
region. This has seriously affected the livelihood of Japanese 
fishermen. For example, the Russian action has decreased their 
catch. For this reason, the Japanese Government has changed its 
traditional stance, hoping to settle the matter in a practical 
way. It intends to conclude an agreement with Russia on the 
matter this year by finalizing basic plans hopefully by August 
in time for next year's fishing season. 
  On 3 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a Diet 
foreign 
affairs committee that the government "wants to encourage 
studying the matter," although it must still be "in line with 
the government's basic stance on the territorial issue." He 
thus indicated for the first time that the government is taking 
a positive attitude regarding the matter. He was answering a 
question from Muneo Suzuki of the Liberal Democratic Party. In 
response to Suzuki's pressing the government to "finalize the 
plans by August," Kakizawa said: "We will do our best." 
  There currently exists a commercial agreement to pay fishing 
fees to Russia that is limited exclusively to gathering kelp off 
Kaigara Island. Last March, the local head of Russia's Southern 
Kurils regional administration, which has jurisdiction over 
Kunashir and other islands of the Kurils chain, proposed to 
Nemuro Mayor Kaiji Oya to expand the fishing fees agreement to 
allow Japanese fishing boats to operate in all of the waters 
around the northern territories. Local fishermen of Nemuro and 
other cities, who seek safer fishing operations, heartily 
welcomed the proposal. At the time, however, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs rejected the idea, asserting that "since the 
agreement on gathering kelp off Kaigara Island is an extremely 
special case, expanding the agreement to allow fishing in all of 
the waters around the northern territories would have a bearing 
on the very roots of our stance regarding the territorial issue." 
  The government has now changed its stance because 
immediately 
after the Russian proposal was submitted, Russian authorities 
stepped up cracking down on violations by initiating a policy 
called "Putina (Fishing Season) `94." This posed a threat to 
the livelihood of many Japanese fishermen. For example, it led 
to a decreased catch as recorded by the Rausu Fishing 
Cooperative in comparison to the previous year. In turn, this 
led to mounting complaints against the government among local 
fishermen, calling for a change in its policy. The Russian 
Government claims there were nearly 8,000 cases of violations by 
Japanese fishing boats last year, and Japanese fishing boats 
continue to be seized. 
  However, should Japan agree to adopt the proposed fishing 
fees system, it could be taken by the international community 
that Japan has made concessions regarding claims of its 
sovereignty over the northern territories. On top of that, it 
may give rise to the possibility of other forms of illegal 
fishing operations. Thus, there still are many hurdles to be 
cleared beforehand.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of </F>
Komeito, by TOKYO SHIMBUN reporters Shigeo Ishii and Ryoji Tateo 
at the Diet building; date not given; first two paragraphs are 
TOKYO SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The ruling coalition party has become a minority 
government due to the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] 
pullout from the government, and is in the largest crisis ever. 
The "Ichi-Ichi line," the duo of Komeito Secretary General 
Yuichi Ichikawa and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, 
has played a "control tower" role of the coalition government. 
How will the Ichi-Ichi line react to this difficult situation? 
Also, was the formation of [parliamentary group] "Kaishin," 
which triggered the SDPJ's pullout, a miscalculation? We asked 
Mr. Ichikawa, who has just become the acting chairman of 
Komeito, to talk frankly about the future course of the chaotic 
political situation. 
  The interview was held in Komeito's waiting room in the Diet 
building. Mr. Ichikawa said, while laughing: "At the meeting 
of presidents of the mass media, I said that one who becomes a 
president from a reporter is not good at conducting business 
because he has not gone through the hardships of sales and 
getting advertisements. I said this while especially looking at 
the face of Nabetsune (the nickname of YOMIURI SHIMBUN President 
Tsuneo Watanabe)." Mr. Ichikawa, who used to be managing editor 
of KOMEI SHIMBUN and had a very hard time not being able to sell 
advertisement, gave an impression that he takes pride in being 
familiar with both sides of the mass media. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Following your appointment as the party's 
acting chairman, is the next step the chairman's post? 
  [Ichikawa] Oh no. It [my appointment] was not carried out as 
part of preparations for the next personnel changes at the 
November party convention. We just sincerely followed Prime 
Minister Hata's policy that, "if a party leader joins the 
cabinet, I want him to concentrate on his job as a member of the 
cabinet." I do not feel that I will be the next chairman, nor 
is there such an atmosphere within the party. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is strengthening the party's organization 
important for the present? 
  [Ichikawa] Since the SDPJ left the Hata Cabinet, party 
leaders' entering the cabinet has become more significant. Then 
it is only natural that the secretary general stay within the 
party. Komeito has been promoting the reorganization of the 
political world early on, and is the first party to say that it 
does not matter if its name disappears. In addition, I was at 
the center of the electoral system reform. 
  It is very irresponsible of me to join the cabinet while the 
[political realignment] plan is not completed. To say that 
there is no one other than myself [to do the job of political 
reorganization] may sound arrogant, but I think it is my duty to 
take responsibility for carrying it out. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] You did not know about the forming of 
"Kaishin?" 
  [Ichikawa] Basically, I did not know about it because we 
were 
not asked to join the group. Since I have been saying the Diet 
dissolution and general election under the new electoral system 
should be fought by organizing a new new-party, I think the 
formation of a parliamentary group is necessary to that end. 
But, (immediately before Kaishin's establishment) there was a 
call from then Prime Minister Hosokawa regarding the group's 
formation, and when I made sure that "You have informed the SDPJ 
about the plan thoroughly," he answered, "the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] is responsible for obtaining agreement 
from the SDPJ, and labor unions and Rengo [Japanese Trade Union 
Confederation]." 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What you were worrying about came true? 
  [Ichikawa] Although those excluded (from "Kaishin") may feel 
unpleasant, the parliamentary group issue is trivial compared to 
destabilizing the political situation. I understand that there 
were various problems with the way the group was formed. 
However, it cannot be a reason (for the SDPJ) to leave the 
government. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you think the forming of the 
parliamentary 
group without informing the SDPJ was wrong? 
  [Ichikawa] Both the SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger] say they 
are determined to oppose the idea of making a new new-party, and 
they will fight separately in an election under the new system. 
Because they say they want to form a coalition again if the 
parties win the election, it is not reasonable to discuss the 
issue of maintaining the coalition in relation to the issue of 
the parliamentary group before an election. Their judgment to 
agree with the LDP's no-confidence motion depending on the 
situation, is too much swayed by party interests. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is talk about canceling "Kaishin" 
among the DSP and the Japan New Party [JNP]. 
  [Ichikawa] If the DSP is going to propose disbanding 
"Kaishin," it has to make clear its leadership's responsibility. 
Political responsibility is to be severely questioned. At 
least, the leadership of the DSP and the JNP will be held 
responsible. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] While process and time are important in 
politics, is not the Ichi-Ichi line rushing too fast? 
  [Ichikawa] The LDP uses words like "high-handed" or 
"hardline" to try to split the ruling coalition party. The mass 
media is reporting that as something funny, which is totally 
different from reality. SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo 
said, "the Ichi-Ichi line does not exist in the meeting of 
coalition representatives. Everybody is involved in the 
decisionmaking." [The Ichi-Ichi line] is a false image made up 
by the mass media. 
  The relationship between chairman and secretary general 
varies from party to party. When things go wrong, the Ichi-Ichi 
line is held responsible for everything while this difference is 
being neglected. For example, there is a party that is divided 
between the left and the right, while there is a party in which 
mutual understanding between its chairman and secretary general 
is lacking. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is also criticism of the Ichi-Ichi 
line's high-handed methods. 
  [Ichikawa] The fact that both Mr. Ozawa and I were 
constantly 
on the sidelines making decisions as the ruling party gave the 
impression that we were taking the leadership. I think the 
criticism is the reaction against it. The mass media is to 
blame too. To make up for the insufficiency in its coverage, 
the press holds the Ichi-Ichi line responsible for anything it 
does not know. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What do you think of Mr. Ozawa's criticism 
of 
the mass media? 
  [Ichikawa] Mr. Ozawa has a streak of shyness. That is why he 
tends not to talk about himself, and the mass media 
misunderstands him. Diet members do not talk the same way with 
reporters as they do with their colleagues. However, Mr. Ozawa 
speaks frankly. So if there is a bad reporter around him he 
could be caught (laughs). (Referring to the ASAHI SHIMBUN report 
that Ozawa said: "It does not matter with which woman you 
sleep," at the time of forming the lower house parliamentary 
group "Kaishin"). 
  Nobody will think good of the content of Mr. Ozawa's remark 
itself. But, men in general say things like that a lot when 
they drink. Well, Mr. Ozawa murmured that as he was walking. 
Usually, it is a rule not to report that, and moreover, a 
reporter of the news agency that covered the news was not 
actually there. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] If the person who is moving the political 
world will not disclose his real intention easily, it is only 
natural to report what is as close as possible to his intention. 
  [Ichikawa] I think it is a question of the press ethics of 
editors that a report based on secondhand information gets a 
four-column heading. I am saying that the news agencies lack a 
sense of ethics considering their public responsibility, and 
this is not meant to be a criticism of TOKYO SHIMBUN. I do not 
intend to defend the content of Mr. Ozawa's remark, but, I am 
saying there is a problem with the press' attitude. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does not Komeito's pacifism stand and Mr. 
Ozawa's military expansion policy conflict? Also, there seems 
to be criticism from Soka Gakkai. 
  [Ichikawa] That is your story. Saying that "Mr. Ozawa is for 
the expansion of the military" is wrong. To argue that Mr. 
Ozawa and Komeito are different by assuming Mr. Ozawa is an 
expansionist, without the grounds for saying so, is very 
prejudiced. I think Japan should advocate world security 
centering on the United Nations. However, there are differences 
between Mr. Ozawa and myself on the procedure for gaining public 
consensus. 
  Mr. Takemura (leader of Sakigake) deliberately says that Mr. 
Ozawa's "normal country" vision is scary. Does Mr. Takemura 
have any plans for international contributions? Nonmilitary 
contribution is deceptive. Calling oneself by a neat name, such 
as SDPJ-DSP liberals or pro-Constitution liberals, while 
labeling others with a name that makes a bad impression is a 
really dangerous method. To talk seriously and firmly is 
regarded as "rigid," and someone who says things with an 
irresponsible vision is regarded as "soft." This is ridiculous. 
Politicians must compete using their brains. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] We heard that you gave an uncommon name to 
your dog. 
  [Ichikawa] I tell my wife and kids that you cannot keep an 
animal unless you think of it as your child. Our dog is a 
female Japanese midget Shiba. Since she looks obedient, I named 
her "Naoko" [a name for girls that shares the morpheme "nao" 
with the word "sunao" meaning "obedient"]. She has a good 
personality, or shall I say "dog"-ality (laughter). Everything 
should be treated with great affection.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Japan, by Shigeo Ishii and Ryoji Tateo, 
TOKYO SHIMBUN editorial staff; date and place not given; first 
paragraph is TOKYO SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] At the start of the Hata regime, the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] left the coalition government 
ranks because of the controversy over the formation of the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin." Now the SDPJ has made public its 
immediate action policy for its return to the government on 
condition that the Hata cabinet resign en bloc following the 
passing of the budget. It is hard for the people to comprehend 
what the SDPJ is aiming at. Among the ruling parties are heard 
voices supporting the SDPJ's policy, making the future political 
development completely unpredictable. What is the aim of the 
SDPJ policy? How is it going to carry out the political 
realignment? SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo, 65 years old, 
was interviewed as to what the party's real intention is. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What does the SDPJ really intend in 
proposing the cabinet resignation en bloc after the passing of 
the budget and the SDPJ's return to the third coalition 
government? 
  [Kubo] What are the immediate things to do to stabilize the 
coalition government? If a no-confidence vote is passed in the 
cabinet, the only way left is a general election. But the 
coalition is "against conducting elections under the plural 
member constituency system." Although the way to dissolving the 
Diet and then conducting elections is blocked, we can play the 
best card in the end. In my opinion, the plural-member 
constituency system may have to be used as the last resort. 
  When the cabinet has to resign en bloc as the result of a 
no-confidence vote, there is no other way left than turning over 
the government to the leading opposition party (the LDP). I am 
opposed to that, so there is only one way left. That is to 
reconstruct the Hata coalition cabinet consisting of weak 
minority ruling parties. To make the third coalition government 
a stabilized one, the present regime has to resign en bloc 
following the budget's passage. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] In that case, is Mr. Hata eligible to run 
for premiership? 
  [Kubo] Since the present coalition ruling parties are 
involved in the discussion, every head of a political party is 
eligible for nomination to premiership. Mr. Hata will not be 
eliminated. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is too much party interests and 
tactics for him to resign and assume the premiership again. 
  [Kubo] Therefore, it is necessary for him to clarify the 
reason for the block resignation when he decides to resign. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Then, why did the SDPJ withdraw from the 
coalition government in the first place? 
<H5>  Hata Cabinet's Mission Completed With Budget Formation </H5>
  [Kubo] The foremost reason the SDPJ withdrew was that faith, 
the most important element in the coalition, was betrayed. From 
the outset, the Hata regime had problems that compelled it to be 
vulnerable. Therefore, its mission will be finished with the 
budget's passage. At that point, it can liquidate the problems 
created when the second coalition government was formed. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will not such a problem as the formation of 
the parliamentary group "Kaishin" occur again? 
  [Kubo] It probably will. But it is irresponsible for 
politicians and political parties not to do anything for fear of 
it. A passive attitude must not be taken. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is it all right not to liquidate the double 
power structure represented by Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro 
Ozawa? 
  [Kubo] It is a big mistake to have the illusion that nothing 
can be done without Mr. Ozawa. He is surely an amazing 
politician in his reckless attempt to push through his strategy. 
In his handling of matters, I have noticed dangerous factors of 
trespassing on democratic principles. 
  For that reason, a coalition must be formed. There could be 
battles as well as cooperation. He would think seriously and 
act accordingly when he faces a counterpart to fight against. I 
have the idea that a coalition is impossible unless Mr. Ozawa is 
excluded. I admit he has many excellent points. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Why is it not possible for the SDPJ to form 
a coalition with the LDP, when a coalition is possible with Mr. 
Ozawa, who has a different theoretical view of the state, to 
form a coalition with the LDP? 
<H5>  No Policy Agreement Exists With the LDP </H5>
  [Kubo] There exists a complete agreement of opinions with 
Shinseito in our policy and basic agreements. No such 
agreements exist with the LDP. Mr. Ozawa's theoretical view of 
the state has been clearly made public in the Ozawa 
investigation committee's report and in his book, "A Blueprint 
for a New Japan." Even if we went to hell, there could be no 
agreement in these matters. But at present, Shinseito and the 
SDPJ have compromised to reach an agreement. It is possible for 
representatives of the political parties that share the regime 
to cooperate in government beyond the difference in theoretical 
views of the state. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The chairman's and secretary general's 
positions on returning to the fold of the government sound 
different. 
<H5>  Both Men in Agreement for United Efforts of the SDPJ </H5>
  [Kubo] We are in complete agreement in that the SDPJ will do 
its best to form a new coalition government. Mr. Murayama and 
his followers insist on opening a new phase by positively 
pushing for a general election, if there are no other means. I 
am insisting on the block resignation, to form a more democratic 
and more powerful coalition government by making the most of 
experience in the first coalition. We are looking at the same 
moon over the mountain from different sides of the mountain. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you not think the LDP is acting the same 
way the old SDPJ did? 
  [Kubo] Well, it is a hell of a lot more unskillful an 
opposition party than the SDPJ used to be. (laughter) In their 
interpellation at the Budget Committee, they hit at mistakes at 
random but we did not attack that way. The LDP has not become a 
real opposition party yet. (laughter) On the contrary, they 
might be thinking that the SDPJ cannot become a ruling party as 
they expected. (laughter) 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How do you expect the political realignment 
will go? 
<H5>  Worrying About Comeback of Big Conservative Alliance </H5>
  [Kubo] The reason I am insisting on the formation of a third 
coalition government originates from worries that a big 
conservative alliance will be restored if the present situation 
is left untouched. Prime Minister Hata does not think he can 
survive until the next Diet session. Some sort of strengthening 
measure is necessary. If we continue to refuse cooperation in 
that situation, we will be committing a grave mistake. As for 
the SDPJ, a partial alliance with the LDP that changes as the 
case may be is a possibility. With a wide list of choices, the 
SDPJ will secure and maintain its leadership in forming the next 
regime. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What will its combination be? 
  [Kubo] The government will be a coalition and the political 
forces will be tripolar for the time being. They are an "old 
conservative party," a "new conservative party," and a "new 
kakushin [reformist]," that is a congregation of liberal forces 
based on complete democracy. These tripolar forces will form a 
varied coalition government as they find possible bases for 
cooperation in policies. In the future, they will be contracted 
into the "new conservatives" and the "new kakushin," bringing in 
time two great forces, alternately taking control of the 
government. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is not the single-member constituency system 
disadvantageous for the tripolar forces? 
  [Kubo] I doubt that the LDP will really be in a predominant 
position. At present, the LDP holds a popularity rate of 20 
percent, compared to the old days when it commanded 40-50 
percent popularity. The new conservatives, all added up, have a 
nearly 20 percent popularity rate. If it tries hard, the SDPJ 
can come up with nearly 20 percent support. Thus the time has 
come for the tripolar forces to compete for one Diet seat in 
each constituency. If we have the thought that the LDP candidate 
cannot be defeated unless we stage a united campaign, it will 
lead us to a loss of confidence. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi a candidate 
for premiership? 
  [Kubo] I want him to come back with vigor to the central 
political field. He must come back at the opportune time. He 
is unmistakably one of the leaders of a new time. But he is not 
the only one. He is a lot younger than I.

  [Text] A nationwide public opinion poll taken by YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN from 21 to 22 May on the "central government 
bureaucracy" showed that nearly 80 percent of the respondents 
favored reforming the central government bureaucracy and a 
majority of the respondents supported a plan for abolishment of 
the so-called "government committee system" to let many 
politicians take key posts in government ministries and 
agencies, and bear the responsibility for politics. In this 
way, the poll revealed that the people take a critical view of 
the central government bureaucracy. Asked why the government 
has come under the bureaucracy's control, many respondents cited 
the "lack of able politicians" as a major reason, while others 
cited the "unreliability of politicians" as the major reason. 
  Asked about their impression of bureaucrats in the central 
government, 43 percent of the polled said, "They get jobs in 
enterprises and government-invested corporations that they have 
formerly overseen"; 34 percent said, "They have collusive ties 
with politicians and businesses"; and 28 percent said, "They 
have a kind of privileged mentality." Thus, many of the polled 
had a bad impression of the bureaucrats working for the central 
government. Only less than 20 percent of the surveyed had a good 
impression of them. Twenty percent of the surveyed said, "They 
are excellent"; 11 percent said, "They are diligent"; and 3 
percent said, "They are fair and clean." 
  Asked who is taking the lead in the government's 
decisionmaking process, 46 percent of the respondents answered, 
"The bureaucrats take the lead"; 17 percent answered, 
"Politicians take the lead"; and 30 percent answered, "We have 
no position." In this way, nearly 50 percent of the people 
thought that the government is under the "thumb of bureaucracy." 
Asked to point out things for which the bureaucrats deserve to 
be praised highly, 27 percent of the polled said, "They have 
nothing to be praised highly for." Asked about things for which 
the bureaucrats deserve to be criticized, 34 percent pointed to 
"their collusive ties with politicians and businesses." 
  Asked why the bureaucrats have come to wield so great an 
influence in running the government, 39 percent of the polled 
indicated the "lack of politicians powerful enough to manage the 
bureaucrats"; 34 percent pointed to "the lack of a mechanism 
under which the people keep the bureaucrats in check"; and 33 
percent of them said, "The budget compilation is impossible 
without the bureaucrats." Thus, many of the respondents 
indicated the politicians' incompetence. 
  Asked to comment on the plan for abolishing the so-called 
"government committee system" proposed by Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa ), 54 percent of 
the surveyed said, "We support the plan" and 20 percent of them 
said, "We oppose the plan." As reasons for supporting the plan, 
the respondents said: 1) The plan will make parliamentary 
deliberations substantial and 2) the plan will make it possible 
to keep the bureaucrats in check. As reasons for opposing the 
plan, the respondents said: 1) The plan will further serve to 
solidify the collusive ties between politicians and bureaucrats 
and 2) the plan will lead politicians to intervene in 
administrative authority. 
  Asked to comment on a desirable bureaucracy, nearly 80 
percent of the respondents expressed hopes for reforming the 
bureaucracy one way or another, claiming, "Measures must be 
taken to reduce their power" or "measures must be taken to 
lessen their jurisdiction mentality." Meanwhile, 10 percent of 
the respondents said, "They are good and no measures need to be 
taken" and 13 percent said, "We have no position." Asked 
whether the Hata government will be able to reform the 
bureaucracy, 11 percent of them said, "The Hata government will 
be able to reform them" and 77 percent of them said, "it will be 
unable to do that." In this way, the people's expectations of 
the minority government were found to be slim. 
  Of the respondents, 53 percent said, "The bureaucracy should 
not be allowed to take jobs in enterprises or 
government-invested corporations that they have formerly 
overseen."

  [Text] Rengo [the Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
headed by Akira Yamagishi] held a Central Committee session in 
Fukuoka city on 2 June. In the session, the Central Committee 
discussed ways to reform the current tax system and adopted a 
platform supporting the future raise of the indirect tax rate to 
secure financial resources for social welfare security in a 
society of senior citizens. With regard to Rengo's response to 
the future realignment of political parties, the Central 
Committee decided to create "a Rengo politics and policy forum" 
in July that will become a key body to rally liberal political 
forces, including the opposition Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] and the ruling Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. 
The Central Committee also approved a package of plans for the 
spring labor offensive and the study of the possibility of Rengo 
discontinuing the traditional demand for uniform wage increases. 
  With regard to reforming the current tax system, the Central 
Committee adopted a "basic guideline for reforming the current 
tax system" and set the ceiling of the people's tax burden rate 
at 50 percent. During the session, the Central Committee called 
on the government to increase public spending for basic pensions 
and medical treatment of the aged and emphasized that "Rengo 
would pay attention to how the indirect tax will be handled." 
Several attendees argued against raising the indirect tax, 
saying: "Our support for raising the indirect tax rate may be 
interpreted as our approval of consumption tax hikes," but their 
argument was overridden by the Rengo leadership. Explaining how 
Rengo plans to promote the reform of the current tax system, the 
Rengo leadership said Rengo would propose that: 1) unfair 
taxation be addressed; 2) a comprehensive taxation and a 
taxpayer numbering system be introduced; 3) the consumption tax 
be revamped so as to abolish profit tax [ekizei] and shift to 
invoices [shiokurijo]; and 4) the retrogressive tax be eased. 
The Rengo leadership was not specific about how it will promote 
the reform of the current tax system. 
  The platform did not clearly indicate the shift of the 
consumption tax to an earmarked tax that the SDPJ has advocated, 
but only said: "The priority shall be given to spending the 
budget for the social welfare." The platform accepted a 
proposal from the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' 
Union for the "creation of a local consumption tax." 
  Rengo Central Committee decisions made during the session 
will centrally affect debates of ruling parties and the SDPJ on 
reforming the current tax system. The Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] is moving closer to what Rengo is advocating in connection 
with the reform of the current tax system and how the LDP 
responds to those decisions will draw attention. 
  The forum will be organized by politicians of political 
parties that have supported, cooperated with, and maintained 
friendly relations with Rengo, and opinion leaders and 
representatives of organizations that can cooperate with Rengo. 
Rengo will call on "politicians who participated in forming the 
Hosokawa government to join the forum," (according to a senior 
Rengo official). The forum is likely to be formed in tune with 
the tripolar theory expounded by President Yamagishi, who has 
described the LDP as a conservative A, and Komeito and Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] as a conservative B.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article in five installments: "A Close Look </F>
at the Trust Fund Bureau"; the last installment is based on an 
interview with Atsushi Miyawaki, senior economist of the Japan 
Research Institute; place and date not given] 
<H5>  [5 Apr 94 p 7] </H5>
  [Text] The fiscal investment and loan program has been, and 
is being, used not only for successive countercyclical measures 
but also to subrogate government budget in the funding of 
certain activities normally covered under the budget's general 
account. The Trust Fund Bureau of the Ministry of Finance 
[MOF], which provides the funds for the fiscal investment 
program, is a gigantic "government purse" with an asset capacity 
in excess of 320 trillion yen. Recently, this very Trust Fund 
Bureau began causing a variety of unsettling problems: the 
disturbance of the bond market caused by the Trust Fund Bureau's 
sale of its government bond holdings was a case in point. The 
rising cost of collecting postal savings, a source of funds for 
the Trust Fund Bureau, and the swollen flow of funds from the 
Trust Fund Bureau through government-affiliated financial 
institutions are further exacerbating economic strains. What 
follows is an investigation of the problems surrounding the 
Trust Fund Bureau. 
<H5>  The Price of Abusing an "Aladdin's Lamp": Hypertrophy </H5>
Causing Grating Pains Everywhere 
  "No doubt the MOF is waiting for bond prices to rise 
(pushing 
the yield down). As soon as the price goes up, for sure the MOF 
will move to sell its bond holdings. It is too scary to buy 
bonds." These are the words being whispered around of late 
among those dealing with the bond market. 
<H5>  Clearance Sales of Government Bonds Rocked the Market </H5>
  What the market is wary of is the Trust Fund Bureau's 
disposal (selling out) of government bonds with no repurchase 
provisions. The Trust Fund Bureau gathers funds from postal 
savings and welfare pension premiums and lends them to such 
institutions as the Housing Loan Corporation and the Japan 
Highway Public Corporation. The MOF, which manages the Trust 
Fund Bureau's fund position, on 14 January decided to sell its 
bond holdings worth some 900 billion yen in successive 
increments. The reason for the decision was that, as a result 
of more than 13 trillion yen the Trust Fund Bureau had poured 
into institutions such as the Housing Loan Corporation and the 
Small Business Finance Corporation in conjunction with the four 
rounds of countercyclical measures put into effect since August 
1991, the Trust Fund Bureau's fund position became so critical 
that the ministry decided the only way to get the Trust Fund 
Bureau out of the fix was to raise additional funds by selling 
off its government-bond holdings on the market. 
  The disposal by the Trust Fund Bureau of its government bond 
holdings began on 21 January. The sale on that day was worth 
102.8 billion yen; it was followed by another sale on 4 February 
which was worth 115.3 billion yen, and by yet another sale worth 
86.8 billion yen on 21 February. These sales of government 
bonds by the Trust Fund Bureau rocked the market severely. The 
yield on long-term government bonds, which was at the 2.9 
percent range early in January, rose sharply to reach above 4 
percent at the beginning of March. 
  In the interest of supporting the bond market, the current 
situation would normally call for a buying-up operation either 
by the Trust Fund Bureau or by using the National Debt 
Consolidation Fund; however, sources within the MOF 
categorically state that "no such action is being considered at 
all" (words of an official of the Financial Bureau, MOF). The 
Trust Fund Bureau of course is in no shape to take such an 
action, but another factor is that even the National Debt 
Consolidation Fund, too, cannot be of much help because there is 
a two-year suspension of fixed-rate transfers of funds into the 
reserves for government bond redemption; "even if they wanted to 
run a buying operation, they lack the resources for it." 
<H5>  The Bank of Japan Frowns at the Trust Fund Bureau Action </H5>
  Not only is the MOF planning no action to support the bond 
market, it is rather poised to sell at the next appropriate time 
the remainder of its government bond holdings originally planned 
for disposal--the remainder worth some 600 billion yen. 
  The sales of government bonds by the Trust Fund Bureau have 
triggered a sharp rise in long-term interest rates. As a 
result, the bank's lending rates have begun to rise as well, 
spawning a fear that all this could once again prove to be a 
drag on the economy which at last is beginning to show some 
signs of brightness. It is said that "even the Bank of Japan is 
frowning at the Trust Fund Bureau's recent moves" (according to 
a ranking city bank). 
  A dispute arose within the MOF in the fall of 1993. Fumio 
Inui, chief of the First Fund Planning and Operation Division, 
Financial Bureau, MOF, who controls the Trust Fund Bureau's 
affairs, complaining bitterly about the dire fund position of 
the Trust Fund Bureau, took firm stand against the ministry's 
Budget Bureau responsible for the preparation of the 
general-account budget: he told the Budget Bureau that the 
Trust Fund Bureau "could no longer cooperate with them as 
actively as it had done before." 
  Over the past years, the Trust Fund Bureau has turned into a 
handy reservoir of funds which can be tapped into to circumvent 
shortfalls in the general-account budget whose fiscal condition 
has become increasingly tight. To be specific, it is the Trust 
Fund Bureau that has provided funds to the National Railway 
Settlement Corporation that inherited the old liabilities of the 
former National Railways; also, it is the Trust Fund Bureau that 
pitches in with funds to meet any shortfall in local allocation 
tax revenue which the central government must distribute to 
local governments. In the final analysis, what enabled the 
government to somehow muddle through with its countercyclical 
measures was the availability of a "trump card" at its 
disposal--i.e., a bold expansion of the fiscal investment plans 
financed by the Trust Fund Bureau's funds. 
  Public properties and facilities, the benefit of which is 
widely shared by the people, shall be paid for with the 
general-account funds, while semi-public facilities such as 
expressways shall be funded by the Trust Fund Bureau--this 
guiding principle broke down long ago; it cannot be denied that 
there has been a tendency by the government to readily make use 
of the Trust Fund Bureau as the source of "invisible loans" for 
national and local self-governing entities. 
  The Trust Fund Bureau has been abused like an "Aladdin's 
lamp." In the background responsible for the abuse is the handy 
availability of Trust Fund Bureau funds, the utilization of 
which for a period of less than five years does not even require 
consent of the Diet. Neither a temporary transfer of Trust Fund 
Bureau funds into the Special Account for Local Allocation Tax 
nor a disposal of the Trust Fund Bureau's government-bond 
holdings is ever reflected in the fiscal investment and loan 
plan submitted to the Diet. The assets in the Trust Fund 
Bureau's custody, which totaled less than 100 trillion yen in 
the 1980's, have ballooned to 321 trillion yen, some of which 
have been coming in and out of the Trust Fund Bureau without 
being checked by anybody. But the Trust Fund Bureau's surplus 
funds have reached the bottom; furthermore, the Trust Fund 
Bureau is now being hit by a "market backlash" in the form of a 
sharp drop in bond prices. 
<H5>  Information Disclosure Should Be the First Step </H5>
  "The time has come to review the question of the Trust Fund 
Bureau's `posture as it ought to be,' including the ideal way of 
fiscal operations." These words advocating reform of the Trust 
Fund Bureau were spoken by none other than Seiji Kanematsu, 
chairman of the Fund Operation Council (an advisory body for 
ministers of finance and of posts and telecommunications). It 
would not be easy to apply a surgical knife to the Trust Fund 
Bureau, which is even likened to a house of demons. Would it be 
wrong to suggest that the first step toward reform should be to 
promote disclosure of information regarding the Trust Fund 
Bureau in such terms that can be understood even by ordinary 
people? 
<H5>  [6 Apr 94 p 7] </H5>
  [Text] Disparity Between "Fund Procurement" and "Fund 
Operation": Contradiction Widens Due to Deregulation of 
Interest Rates 
  "What you are saying is absolutely no different from the 
very 
logic being pursued by the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [MOPT]." This has been the caustic criticism 
leveled at (Hiroshi) Nagano, councilor to the MOF's Banking 
Bureau, every time he made a round of city banks and reginal 
banks since the middle of February to lay a certain groundwork. 
<H5>  Concern of the Private Sector Failed To Be Dispelled </H5>
  The aim of the groundwork has been to gain acceptance by the 
banks of the MOF's proposal concerning the question of 
deregulating the interest rates on liquid deposits and savings 
which can readily be deposited and withdrawn; one of the key 
points of the proposal reads, "The interest-rate differential 
between regular postal savings (current rate 1.32 percent) and 
the ordinary bank deposit (current rate 0.22 percent) shall be 
maintained at 1.1 percent for the present time." The reason for 
the MOF's drive to get its proposal through is twofold: First, 
it would mean a culmination of the deposit rate deregulation 
effort of 15 years standing; second, the MOF feels obliged to 
get this matter settled somehow or other because, for one thing, 
Japan officially promised the United States to put interest-rate 
deregulation into effect before the end of 1994. 
  Councilor Nagano has sought the banking industry's 
understanding of the MOF's position as to why the bank deposit 
cannot be given unduly favorable consideration in the proposed 
deregulation of interest rates. But the debate between him and 
the industry has failed to reach a point of agreement. Behind 
the industry's objection to the MOF's position is a fear that 
"the rate differential between the ordinary bank deposit and 
postal savings might further widen and thereby cause a shift of 
even more funds from one to the other" (words of the planning 
officer at a leading city bank). As a matter of fact, in fiscal 
1993 regular postal savings, contemptuously outdistancing the 
stagnant ordinary deposit in commercial banks, recorded the 
highest growth ever. 
  Early in February, an economic research institute affiliated 
with another major bank completed an "internal use only" report. 
The report contains a coolheaded analysis of the relationship, 
prone to be emotionally antagonistic, between the bank and the 
postal savings; not only does the report give equal airing to 
the positions of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan 
and the MOPT on each point at issue, it also attempts to assess 
the present situation from an objective standpoint. 
<H5>  The State's Credit Standing Not Reflected </H5>
  Deserving of particular attention is the portion of the 
report dealing with the rivalry between the postal savings 
program and the bank. In reference to postal savings, while the 
bankers federation calls it "a privileged entity" and even those 
managing it take a subjective view that "being a government 
enterprise, it is subject to many restrictions," the report in 
question coolly points out that "(the level of interest rate on 
postal savings) does not reflect the state's credit standing." 
The report takes this position because determination of 
interest rates on the basis of credit standings is a major 
principle of the free financial market. 
  Article 3 of the Postal Savings Law stipulates: "The state 
guarantees the repayment of the money deposited into the postal 
savings account and the payment of interest on such savings." 
In a sense, postal savings are a deposit with the highest 
credit standing within the country. If sound market mechanisms 
were at work, the common-sense view is that it should suffice to 
pay low interest to the users of the postal savings system. 
Historically, however, it has been the other way around. For 
more than 40 years since April 1952, the rate differential 
between regular postal savings and ordinary bank deposits has 
never gone below the 1.0 percent level. This means that "a 
strange situation from the standpoint of financial common sense" 
(words of an "old boy" of the MOF Banking Bureau) has been kept 
in place. 
  Because of the tight fiscal situation of the general account 
section of the budget, the Trust Fund Bureau is being subjected 
to ever-increasing demands for funds. As of the end of February 
1994, the postal savings system had deposited 181 trillion yen 
in the Trust Fund Bureau, the sum equivalent to 56 percent of 
Trust Fund Bureau's total liabilities. The more the role of 
fiscal investment and loan programs expands, the more necessary 
it would become to maintain the fund collection power of the 
postal savings system. For this reason, the interest rate on 
postal savings cannot be held down too low. The aformentioned 
MOF's proposal was seen by those of the private-sector financial 
world as a move "to subjugate the setting of interest rates to 
the logic of fiscal operations." 
  A big problem the Trust Fund Bureau has is the existence of 
a 
disparity between the real interest paid on funds procured 
(i.e., interest paid on postal savings) and the interest earned 
from fund operations (i.e., interest earned on fiscal 
investments). For example, for a period of two years and three 
months from January 1990, the interest rates on regular postal 
savings stayed at high levels between 2.16 percent and 3.48 
percent, while the fiscal investment interest rate (the same as 
the deposit rate) remained at 2.0 percent (for a period of more 
than one month but less than three months). This negative 
spread surfaces as a deficit in the Postal Savings Special 
Account. 
<H5>  Application of Market Forces Needed </H5>
  The principle of allowing the rates on deposits of 
accounting 
officers to change in tandem with the movement of interest rates 
on the market has been introduced, but this applies only to 
long-term deposits of seven years or more. The rates on short- 
and medium-term deposits of less than seven years are still 
hardly reflective of market interest rates. Some people are 
saying: "No matter how deregulated the rates on postal savings 
may be, as long as the interest rates on fiscal investments and 
on the deposits of accounting officers are kept detached from 
the movement of market interest rates, the problem will not be 
resolved. 
  As the deregulation of interest rates progresses, it is 
possible that the postal savings system will have to bear a 
higher cost than before in order to collect funds. Furthermore, 
lending at low rates under the slogan of "policy-guided finance" 
will further exacerbate the Trust Fund Bureau's contradiction 
known as a "negative spread." The secretariat of the Committee 
on Andit in the upper house of the Diet analyzes the situation 
this way: "The postal savings system is prone to red ink. Its 
structure is such that it will not be able to raise funds unless 
the rates on deposits are either set higher or increased on a 
continuing basis." 
  The postal savings issue, as a point of "entry" into the 
question of the Trust Fund Bureau fund, is not merely a problem 
of rivalry with the private-sector financial institutions. 
Simply discussing the rate differential between postal savings 
and bank deposits and the marketability of "fixed-amount 
savings" as a new product will not lead to a fundamental 
solution. The following is a fair statement: "The situation has 
reached a point where a new kind of fiscal investment system 
must be introduced--a system that makes full use of market 
forces, including the deregulation of interest rates relevant to 
the Trust Fund Bureau's procurement and investment of funds" 
(words of a leading official of a long-term credit bank). To 
the Trust Fund Bureau system, the fiscal investment system, and 
the postal savings system as a whole, financial deregulation is 
the biggest Achilles' heel right now.

  [Text] Ballooning Lending by "Government Banks": 
Outdoing the Private Sector Qualitatively and Quantitatively 
  "If given (from the government) as much interest subsidy as 
400 billion yen (the amount given to the Housing Loan 
Corporation), we in the private sector, too, can offer 
competitive interest rates." With private-sector financial 
institutions unable to increase their lending activity even if 
they wanted to, the vice president of a certain city bank, who 
made the above remarks, looked bitter about the growing volume 
of housing loans being issued by the Housing Loan Corporation. 
<H5>  The Public Sector's Share Exceeds 50 Percent </H5>
  For fiscal 1993, government subsidies given to 
government-affiliated financial institutions out of the general 
account funds are estimated to have reached some 560 billion 
yen. Of the total, the largest portion--400 billion yen--went 
to the Housing Loan Corporation, followed by more than 100 
billion yen to the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance 
Corporation. In the case of the Housing Loan Corporation, the 
subsidy it received, if calculated in terms of interest, was 
equivalent to 0.7 percent. Which means that they were able to 
reduce their lending interest rate by that much. Similarly, in 
the case of the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Finance 
Corporation, the subsidy was equivalent to 1.9 percent of its 
lending rate. 
  From 11 April on, city banks' housing loans will carry a 
fixed interest rate of 5.82 percent. Between this and the 
standard rate (4.05 percent annual) charged by the Housing Loan 
Corporation, there is a differential of nearly 2 percent. What 
has happened is that "market forces are not working in the field 
of housing financing" (a leading official of a ranking city 
bank). 
  On the strength of their overwhelming advantageous lending 
terms, government-affiliated financial institutions are doing a 
ballooning business in making loans. According to Bank of Japan 
statistics, the government-affiliated financial institutions, 
comprised of two banks, one of which is Japan Development Bank, 
and nine finance corporations, including the Housing Loan 
Corporation, had as of the end of January 1994 outstanding loan 
balances totaling slightly less than 118 trillion yen, which 
represented 11-percent growth from a year earlier. During the 
same period, total lending by all banks nationwide grew only by 
0.1 percent. 
  The share of public lending, too, has gradually increased. 
According to the Bank of Japan's "flow of funds accounts," of 
the fiscal 1992 growth in combined lending by the private sector 
and public finance institutions, the share of public lending was 
more than one half--53 percent to be specific. The share 
apparently increased even more in fiscal 1993. The share of 
government-affiliated financial institutions alone was 22 
percent, but it has been growing for these past few years. It 
appears that "public financing, originally meant to play a 
supporting role only, has assumed the leading role." This is 
due in part to the increased lending by government-affiliated 
financial institutions in order to stimulate the economy. 
  Those of the private sector are rebellious--they are 
complaining: "government-affiliated institutions, whose 
intrinsic role should be to complement the private sector, have 
come barging into the field of lending which the private sector 
is capable of handling." According to a survey by a major bank, 
more than half of the loans issued by the Japan Development Bank 
are concentrated on 30 business firms that are among the top 
loan customers of private-sector financial institutions. 
Although in form these government-affiliated institutions are 
still sticking with project financing which is supposed to be 
handled on a case-by-case basis, they are said to be 
disproportionately concentrating their lending to "just those 
big companies whose borrowing needs can be fully accommodated by 
the private sector as well." 
<H5>  Target Criteria for Lending Broadened </H5>
  In order to give preferential treatment to those projects 
that meet policy objectives, government-affiliated financial 
institutions have in place a system of "special interest rates" 
that are lower than the standard rates. This explains why 
private-sector financing officers are saying that they are 
"unable to compete with government-affiliated financial 
institutions when it comes to lending terms." Although it is 
not disclosed as to what percentage of the lending by 
government-affiliated financial institutions is at such special 
rates, the realistic sense of the private sector is that the 
percentage "is increasing quite a bit." 
  The Japan Development Bank Law was revised in 1972, 1985, 
and 
1991. Each revision led to a broadening of the scope of lending 
criteria. Lending for alternative energy projects began in 1980 
and for improvement of key railways and augmentation of 
industrial structure in 1987. More recently, a loan program has 
been initiated for the purpose of promoting energy-saving 
equipment investment. All this means that government-affiliated 
financial institutions have become hypertrophied not only 
quantitatively but also qualitatively. 
  But there are recent indications that some among the 
government-affiliated financial institutions, whose lending has 
been rapidly increasing, are leaving some of the fiscal 
investment funds allocated to them unspent. As a result of the 
repeated countercyclical measures that significantly expanded 
the lending limits of government-affiliated financial 
institutions, some of these institutions are saying: "However 
much we lend, we seem perpetually unable to fully digest our 
lending limits" (a leading official of a certain 
government-affiliated financial institution). 
  According to a survey conducted by financial quarters on the 
basis of government-affiliated financial institutions' own 
statements of accounts and audit reports on their statements, 
the delinquency ratio of the loans issued by these institutions 
was 0.5 percent as of fiscal 1991. That ratio, though healthy 
in comparison with the private-sector ratio which had risen to 
about 3 percent on an average, has been on an uptrend. 
<H5>  Specialization in Augmentation of Infrastructure </H5>
  "Given the need to increase public investment so as to 
digest 
excess savings, there should be a role to fulfill for fiscal 
investment agencies," says Hirohiko Okumura, research director 
of the Nomura Research Institute. According to him, even though 
Japan's capital flow is bulging with funds from such sources as 
life insurance and pension programs--the kind of money which 
ought to be utilized for long-term investment, such funds are 
being utilized only for short-term investment simply because 
short-term real interest rates are higher. He also says that 
the failure to channel the funds, which should be used for 
repleting infrastructure, to long-term investment is hampering 
growth of the Japanese economy. 
  Intrinsically, government-affiliated financial institutions 
are charged with the task of providing funds to such projects 
which are difficult for private-sector financial institutions to 
handle. Thus, it seems even reasonable to say that for 
government-affiliated financial institutions to take the road of 
specialization in the financing of large-scale infrastructure 
augmentation projects that preclude competition with the private 
sector would, in the final analysis, lead to the redressing of 
the distortians now occurring in the flow of funds.

  [Text] Absence of Fund Manager Leads Safety, 
Effectiveness of Fiscal Investment To Go Askew 
  In his domestic speech delivered on 23 March, Under 
Secretary 
of Treasury Summers of the U.S. Government raised the subject of 
opening up the "assets management" market as an item to be 
demanded of Japan. Clearly, by "assets management" he was 
referring to the investment management of public pension funds; 
it is also clear that he was demanding the lifting of Japan's 
ban on entrusting its public pension funds to investment 
advisory firms for management. Mr. Summers' position on this 
subject is substantially the same as a standing demand of the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare [MHW] to the MOF; therefore, it 
is bound to prove to be a powerful reinforcement to the MHW 
whose negotiations with the MOF are having tough going. 
<H5>  An Annual Profit Margin of 3 Percent </H5>
  The welfare pension and national pension reserve funds are 
placed in trust with the Trust Fund Bureau, from whom the 
Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation [PWSPC, which is 
supervised by the MHW] borrows some of the funds for investment 
purposes. In other words, the PWSPC is engaged in independent 
investment activities using the Trust Fund Bureau fund; the 
amount of money so invested was roughly 19.5 trillion yen as of 
the end of fiscal 1993. At present, the PWSPC is allowed to 
consign such investment activities to life insurance companies 
and trust companies only; however, it is the contention of the 
MHW and the U.S. Government that the consigness should be 
expanded to include investment advisory firms. 
  But this independent investment program using public pension 
funds has been a losing proposition on a continuing basis. Due, 
among other things, to the falling stock prices, the investment 
yield has been less than the interest paid on the money borrowed 
from the Trust Fund Bureau; the program apparently ended fiscal 
1993 in the red for the third time in as many years. These 
investment losses cut into the reserve funds; however, despite 
such poor performances, the MHW shows no signs of weakening its 
demand for an expansion of the independent investment program. 
  There is a trial calculation made by the PWSPC. It shows 
that during the 20-year period from fiscal 1973 to fiscal 1992 
the combined value of the prices of and dividends accrued from 
all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased at an 
average annual rate of 9.65 percent, while the borrowing 
interest rate from the Trust Fund Bureau averaged at 6.65 
percent. Granted, stock prices fell in some of those years; 
still, over the long haul, investments in that period should 
have enjoyed a 3-percent profit margin, mathematically. 
  The PWSPC is confident that "the efficiency of the 
independent investment program would improve if funds were 
invested for longer terms and through diversified consigness who 
would have to compete harder." According to the MHW, due to 
sharply rising annuity payments there is a probability that by 
fiscal 2025 the welfare pension insurance premium could balloon 
to 29.6 percent (to be split 50-50 between the employer and the 
employee; currently 14.5 percent) of the worker's monthly pay. 
The MHW is adamant about the merit of the independent 
investment program, saying that the program's success would add 
to pension reserve funds and thereby "lessen the burdens on the 
people." 
<H5>  Expansion Conceals Debts </H5>
  But the MOF's position is that "investment in stocks could 
very well hurt the stability of the pension funds" (the 
ministry's Financial Bureau). The position reflects the MOF's 
desire to maintain its influence over the pension funds, but 
there is more to it than that: the same line of thinking governs 
the MOF's posture vis-a-vis the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, which is also seeking an expansion of its 
independent investment authority over the postal savings fund. 
Because postal savings and pension funds must sooner or later 
be refunded or paid out as benefits, it is only natural to 
demand that their investment management be safe and secure. But 
this logic, preached by the Trust Fund Bureau, is being violated 
by the Trust Fund Bureau itself. 
  A typical example of the Trust Fund Bureau's fund 
management, 
which is anything but safe and secure, is the lending to the 
National Railway Settlement Corporation which inherited the 
liabilities of the former National Railways. This settlement 
corporation is saddled with liabilities exceeding 20 trillion 
yen; yet, because of the difficulty in selling land assets, also 
inherited from the old National Railways, the corporation must 
borrow huge sums of money just to make interest payments on 
debts. For fiscal 1994, the Trust Fund Bureau plans to provide 
the corporation more than 1.2 trillion yen out of the fiscal 
investment fund; some are calling this planned funding 
"additional lending pure and simple, designed to preserve the 
old debt" (a major city bank). 
  The Trust Fund Bureau is also planning 280 billion yen of 
fiscal investment fund into the National Forest Service Special 
Account, which is perpetually in the red, to help repay loans. 
Meanwhile, nonperforming loans on the books of 
government-affiliated financial institutions are increasing 
sharply. If the money tied up in all these fiscal investments 
by the Trust Fund Bureau cannot be recovered, the resulting 
losses will have to be covered with the general-account funds. 
In other words, ultimately it is the people's tax money that 
must come to the rescue of such losses; in this sense, the Trust 
Fund Bureau's fiscal investment program is even riskier than the 
aforementioned independent investment of pension funds. 
  As the fiscal investment program grows to take over more of 
the funding activities normally covered under the general 
acccount, the number of agencies receiving such fiscal 
investments has also increased. At present there are 61 
institutions on the receiving end of the fiscal investment 
program--more than a fourfold increase during these past 40 
years; it is not incorrect to say that hidden behind such an 
easy expansion of this program are national debts. 
<H5>  Reorganization of Investment Outlets Essential </H5>
  Looking at it as a whole, the fiscal investment program is 
structured to operate on a "negative interest margin": On the 
procurement side, its funds are raised at high interest rates; 
on the investment side, its funds so raised are lent out through 
government-affiliated financial institutions at lower interest 
rates for policy reasons. It is only natural, therefore, that 
there be a demand for higher investment efficiency to make up 
for the negative spread; however, as long as the program is 
devoid of "fund managers" capable of investing the funds safely 
and profitably, chances are the program will grow even more awry. 
  The Japan Research Institute points out: "To reform the 
fiscal investment program, investment agencies must be 
reorganized as the first step." Given the outlook for a 
declining inflow of money into pension funds, for example, a 
review of the investment outlets is a must in the interest of 
curtailing easy-going investments and loans; also, such a review 
has a bearing on the question of clearly differentiating the 
role of financial administration and that of fiscal investment. 
Reorganization and consolidation of the investment outlets is 
an integral part of the administrative reform itself which is 
hardly making progress; nevertheless, that is where a surgical 
knife must be applied if the ailing fiscal investment system is 
to be saved. 
<H5>  [9 Apr 94 p 6] </H5>
  [Text] How should the Trust Fund Bureau, which has 
grown markedly creaky, be reformed in order to bring it in line 
with the new era? In search of the answer to this question, we 
at the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN sought the views of senior economist 
[Atsushi] Miyawaki of the Japan Research Institute, who is 
conversant with this subject area. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think are the biggest 
problems relative to the Trust Fund Bureau and its fiscal 
investment and loan program? 
  [Miyawaki] The Trust Fund Bureau has forgotten the basic 
fact that its financial resources made up of postal savings and 
pension insurance premiums are assets of the people. When 
individuals place their money in trust with an investment agent, 
they naturally expect the agent to invest the money profitably; 
also, they are kept informed by the agent as to where and how 
their money is being invested. This does not obtain in the case 
of the Trust Fund Bureau, however. 
  The amounts of money allocated to public corporations, some 
called "Kosha" and others called "Kodan," are made public; 
however, the details are obscure as to where exactly the postal 
savings money and pension funds placed in the Trust Fund 
Bureau's care have ended up. Especially when it comes to 
short-term use of the Trust Fund Bureau fund, the picture is 
like a "black box": not clear are even such details as the 
purpose of outlay and the balance between outlay and revenue. 
  Moreover, the Trust Fund Bureau fund is being used 
increasingly of late to cover budget deficits and for financial 
juggling between the central government and local jurisdictions 
or between the treasury and special accounts. For instance, the 
Trust Fund Bureau fund is being used by government-affiliated 
financial institutines to make loans which from the beginning 
can be expected to be irrecoverable to some extent as in the 
case of the loans issued by the Export-Import Bank of Japan that 
have taken on more and more of the foreign aid character. Such 
use of the Trust Fund Bureau fund can hardly be termed as 
profitable and safe investments. 
<H5>  Interest Subsidies to the Private Sector </H5>
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But the fiscal investment program has 
the role of providing funds for those purposes which the private 
sector cannot accommodate. Isn't there some aspect of the 
program which cannot be helped even if it violates the principle 
of profitable investment? 
  [Miyawaki] Indeed there is. But even then, should there be 
so many fiscal investment agencies as there are at present? One 
cannot ignore the costs required to operate these agencies and 
to pay their personnel expenses. 
  For example, the policy objective of providing low-interest 
loans to home buyers can be fulfilled without the presence of 
the Housing Loan Corporation. Home buyers seeking loans from 
the Housing Loan Corporation usually go through the windows of 
private-sector financial institutions. This being the case, all 
it takes is to give private-sector financial institutions 
interest subsidies and let them make low-interest loans using 
their own funds to individual home buyers. Application of the 
same interest-subsidy program would make it possible to 
accommodate the functions of such other government-affiliated 
financial institutions as the Small Business Finance 
Corporation, whose rivalry with private-sector institutions has 
been on the rise. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the Trust Fund 
Bureau's financial resources will continue to increase 
satisfactorily in the days ahead? 
  [Miyawaki] That outlook is quite opaque. In the case of 
pension funds, clearly it will be diminishing. It is the 
balance between the pension insurance premiums paid in and 
annuities paid out that is placed in trust with the Trust Fund 
Bureau; as a result of society's progressive aging, the yearly 
inflow of premiums to pension funds currently amounting to 5-6 
trilion yen is expected to shrink to a mere 1 trillion yen or so 
by 2010. Thus, the Trust Fund Bureau will necessarily be 
obliged to rely on postal savings as its only source of funds; 
however, given the ongoing trend toward financial diregulation, 
it remains to be seen whether or not the postal savings system 
will continue to be able to absorb funds in terms more favorable 
than the private sector's. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How best do you suggest a surgical 
knife be applied to the Trust Fund Bureau? 
<H5>  Introduction of Fiscal-Investment Bonds Would Be Effective </H5>
  [Miyawaki] First of all, the Trust Fund Bureau should stop 
using its funds for those objectives which can more 
appropriately be covered by tax money or government bond. Any 
money used to make up for the deficits incurred by the National 
Railway Settlement Corporation, the National Forest Service 
Special Account, etc. is money that will never come back. 
  For medium- and long-term purposes, the Trust Fund Bureau 
should classify its funding activities into "class-A fiscal 
investments," which are to be funded with funds recovered from 
previous investments, and "class-B fiscal investments," which 
are to be funded with new revenues expected in the future. 
Regarding the "class-A fiscal investments," funding levels 
should be reduced to those agencies engaged in such projects 
which can be handled competitively by the private sector, and 
should limit all new investment targets to the development of 
high-risk technologies and the augmentation of life-related 
infrastructure. As for the "class-B fiscal investments," the 
Trust Fund Bureau should aim for profitable investments just 
like life insurance companies and other private-sector 
institutional investors are doing. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How should the effort proceed to 
rationalize public corporations and other fiscal investment 
agencies? 
  [Miyawaki] One idea would be to introduce a scheme whereby 
all such agencies are to issue fiscal investment bonds as a 
means to raise their own funds. Under such a scheme, 
ineffective agencies will only be able to raise funds at a high 
cost and therefore their very existence will be threatened. In 
this sense, the principle of competition will be put to work as 
well under such a scheme. Of course, to those agencies that 
must perform a social role, the idea of giving them interest 
subsidies out of the general account funds may be entertained.

  [Text] Vienna/Seoul/Pyongyang -- In the future, North 
Korea wants to discuss its nuclear program only with the United 
States and no longer with the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency]. This was confirmed on the sidelines of the meeting of 
the Board of Governors of the IAEA in Vienna today by the head 
of the North Korean delegation, Embassy Counselor Yun Ho-chin. 
The communist-ruled country is being accused of building atomic 
bombs. However, Pyongyang has not permitted the IAEA to carry 
out comprehensive inspections in its nuclear center at Yongbyon. 
Thus, the United States, South Korea, and Japan are considering 
supporting UN sanctions against North Korea. Pyongyang has 
reacted with the announcement that sanctions would be considered 
a declaration of war. 
  South Korea's head of state, Kim Yong-sam, who sees a threat 
to world peace, called a meeting of the country's National 
Security Council, which will convene in Seoul on Wednesday [8 
June]. In view of possible sanctions, the body wants to explain 
the attitude of the United States, of Russia, China, and the UN 
Security Council on the nuclear issue. It has so far become 
clear that Moscow and Beijing would reject sanctions. As the 
South Korean state news agency YONHAP reported today, Kim 
described North Korea's nuclear program as a threat to world 
peace. He called on the neighboring communist state to give up 
its "ruthless development program for nuclear weapons." 
  Prior to the meeting of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, 
the director general of the North Korean Atomic Agency, Pak 
Yong-nam, stressed in a letter to IAEA head Hans Blix that his 
country no longer feels bound by the conditions stipulated by 
the IAEA if the IAEA should continue to exert pressure on North 
Korea. "We really doubt whether the nuclear issue can be solved 
through further talks with the IAEA," the letter reads. "We no 
longer want to settle the problems within the framework of the 
nonproliferation treaty, but in the third bilateral round of 
talks with the United States," Pak Yong-nam added. The diplomat 
stated that it would be better to resolve the technical problems 
first and then the political problems. 
  In the letter that is available to DPA, Pak Yong-nam wrote 
that, contrary to earlier statements by Blix, it is naturally 
possible to find out whether North Korea has removed the 
plutonium required for the production of nuclear weapons when it 
exchanged the fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor at 
Yongbyon. He also reaffirmed North Korea's view that it wants 
to maintain a special position within the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, after it announced its resignation 
about one year ago and later suspended this move. 
  If the IAEA should refer the North Korean nuclear issue to 
the UN Security Council, "we no longer feel bound by the IAEA 
and cannot but initiate the next step of our peaceful nuclear 
activities," Pak concluded his letter. The crisis that broke 
out one year ago exacerbated recently as a result of North 
Korea's unauthorized disposal of fuel rods from its reactor. 
Thus, the IAEA cannot ascertain whether plutonium was removed 
for the construction of atomic bombs during the disposal.

  [Text] Jakarta, REPUBLIKA -- Taiwanese investors, who are 
said to be leaving Indonesia due to various problems, are in 
fact increasing their investment here. As of mid-May 1994, 
Taiwan even surprisingly replaced Hong Kong, which had long been 
ranked second in the list of foreign investors in Indonesia 
since 1967. 
  As of mid-May 1994, Taiwanese investment in Indonesia 
totaled 
U.S. $8.68 billion, while Hong Kong's amounted to U.S. $7.17 
billion. Up to last April, Taiwan ranked third with U.S. $5.25 
billion worth of investment in 277 projects, while Hong Kong 
ranked second with U.S. $5.98 billion worth of investment in 270 
projects. Taiwan was ranked ninth five years ago. 
  Haji Ir. [academic title] Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of 
state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment 
Coordinating Board, told reporters following a coordinating 
meeting on industrial and trade affairs on Saturday that the 
situation proved that the rumors about Taiwanese investors 
leaving the country were not true. 
  According to him, Japan remained in the top slot with U.S. 
$17.37 billion worth of investment, representing about 23.2 
percent of the total foreign investment from 1967 to 15 May 
1994. Taiwan and Hong Kong ranked second and third 
respectively. The United States ranked fourth with U.S. $6.99 
billion worth of investment, Great Britain fifth with U.S. $6.95 
billion, the Netherlands sixth with U.S. $6.06 billion, 
Singapore seventh with U.S. $5.92 billion, South Korea eighth 
with U.S. $3.76 billion, Australia ninth with U.S. $1.99 
billion, and Germany tenth with U.S. $1.96 billion. 
  The Investment Coordinating Board approved 314 projects with 
domestic investment totaling 22.75 trillion rupiah from January 
to mid-May 1994, while only 156 projects with domestic 
investment totaling 8.8 trillion rupiah were approved during the 
same period in 1993. There was a 257.3-percent increase in 
terms of the value. 
  The Investment Coordinating Board approved 131 foreign 
investment projects worth U.S. $5.02 billion from January to 
mid-May 1994, while only 85 foreign investment projects worth 
U.S. $3.33 billion were approved during the same period in 1993. 
There was a 150.6- percent increase in terms of the value. 
Sanyoto was optimistic that the investment target during the 
Sixth Five-year Development Plan will be met in view of the huge 
increase in the amount of investment. 
  Although a new investment policy is yet to be issued to 
replace Government Regulation No. 50/1993, there has been a 
tendency toward more investment. 
  He hoped that the new policy will spur further investment. 
Sanyoto pledged that a new regulation to replace Government 
Regulation No. 50/1993 will be issued soon. 
  He said that the government will approve several large 
projects in the next two months. "The interested investors have 
already put forward the large projects, and we are considering 
our approval," he said. 
  The large projects are power plants and oil refineries to be 
built by Hong Kong and Arab investors respectively. "I am 
optimistic that there will be more foreign investment projects 
in 1994 than in 1993," he said. 
  Sanyoto admitted that the realization rates of foreign and 
domestic investment projects remain low. The realization rate 
of foreign investment projects is just 50.8 percent, while that 
of domestic investment projects even is much lower. 
  During the coordinating meeting on industrial and trade 
affairs that took place in Jakarta on Saturday, the coordinating 
minister for industrial and trade affairs asked the minister of 
state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment 
Coordinating Board to monitor more accurately obstacles facing 
investors that led to the very low realization rates. "This 
should be studied to raise the realization rates," Sanyoto 
quoted Hartarto as saying.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 2 (ANTARA) -- The Indonesian Government 
Thursday announced a new investment policy granting greater 
liberties to foreign capital in company share ownership, 
geographical spread and sectoral business lines. 
  Capital Investment Promotiom Minister Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo 
said under the new policy there would be two forms of foreign 
investment: joint ventures and companies 100 percent owned by 
foreigners or foreign corporate bodies. 
  Explaining the main provisions of Government Regulation 
Number 20/94 on share ownership in companies set up under the 
foreign investment scheme, he said Indonesian ownership of 
shares in joint ventures had now been fixed at a minimum of five 
percent. 
  Previously the ratio of share ownership in such ventures 
after 20 years of operation had to be 51 percent Indonesian and 
49 percent foreign. 
  Under the new regulation foreign share-holders are still 
expected to transfer part of their shares to Indonesians after 
15 years of operation but no specific percentage figure has been 
stipulated. 
  "If the Indonesian and foreign partners agree to a 50-50 
shares division, that would be all right. If the foreign 
share-holders decide to transfer only one percent, that would be 
ok too," Sastrowardoyo said. 
  The new regulation further does away with the old 
requirement 
that to set up a 100 percent foreign-owned company, investors 
have to sink a minimum of one million US dollars in it. 
  Now the foreign investors only need to provide initial 
equity 
in an amount as required by the needs of their business. 
  The minister said 100 percent foreign investment projects 
may 
now set up in any part of the country, while previously they had 
been restricted to Batam Island or bonded industrial zones. 
  Joint ventures under the new policy are now permitted to 
operate in the production of goods or services deemed vital to 
the state and affecting the needs of the majority of the 
Indonesian people , Sastrowardoyo said. 
  They included ports, electricity production and 
distribution, 
telecommunications, shipping, aviation, drinking water, railways 
and mass media. 
  However, these areas remain closed to 100 percent 
foreign-owned companies. 
  Based on the new government regulation, companies set up 
under the foreign investment scheme will be given business 
licences valid for 30 years reckoned from the date they begin 
commercial production. 
  On the same occasion Industry Minister T. Ariwibowo said 
that 
after Indonesia allowed the entry of foreign capital, many 
neighbouring countries that used to be closed to foreign 
investors had followed suit. 
  "Therefore, we should review all our economic policies so 
that we can maintain the pace of our development effort," he 
said. 
  He pointed out the country's population growth should be 
anticipated by the creation of new job opportunities and to this 
end Indonesia should achieve an economic growth rate of six 
percent a year. 
  "Government Regulation Number 20/94 is aimed at setting a 
condition for the creation of new jobs that will in turn 
increase the national income through taxes," he said. 
  The government was also hoping that the new policy would 
accelerate the transfer of technology and management skill to 
Indonesians, Ariwibowo said. 
  Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told the same press 
conference, under its sixth five year development plan Indonesia 
plans to induce investments totalling rp [Rupiah] 660 trillion, 
73 percent of which is expected to come from the private sector. 
  This was why the government was giving more opportunities to 
national as well as foreign businessmen, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Renato Constantino, organizer of conference </F>
on East Timor in Manila, by TEMPO correspondent Yuli Ismartono 
-- date not given] 
  [Text] [Ismartono] How did the idea to hold the conference 
on East Timor first begin? 
  [Constantino] The idea to hold the conference was first 
hatched in Bangkok two years ago, namely during a conference 
called the People's Plan for the 21st Century [six preceding 
words in English], which was attended by hundreds of 
nongovernmental organizations from several countries. I must 
admit that it was [East Timor leader opposed to Indonesia] Ramos 
Horta's idea to hold the conference, but we are the organizers 
who prepared the agenda. 
  [Ismartono] Why do most of the participants belong to the 
Fretilin [Revolutionary Front of an Independent East Timor] 
group, who are against East Timor integration into Indonesia? 
  [Constantino] We have invited delegates from all political 
groups and made efforts to ensure that the conference will be 
attended by all sides, including the East Timorese who hold 
different political views. Among these people, there are two 
persons who were recently allowed by the Indonesian Government 
to return to Dili to visit their families. These people are 
certainly not Horta's friends. 
  Indeed, we have been accused of trying to discredit the 
Indonesian Government, but the allegation is not true. I made 
the preparations for the conference in an open manner. Last 
April, I held three-hour talks on the matter with officials of 
the Indonesian Embassy in Manila. We also invited them to send 
their representatives to the conference so they can also voice 
their views. 
  [Ismartono] What are the objectives of the conference? 
  [Constantino] The conference is aimed at turning attention 
to the East Timor issue from a government forum to a people's 
forum. We especially want to look at the human rights issue in 
East Timor. That is why we have invited various nongovernmental 
organizations. We also want to give a chance to all parties 
involved in the East Timor issue to voice their views in an 
academic atmosphere devoid of government threat or influence. 
Among the ASEAN countries, I believe only the Philippines can 
provide such an atmosphere. 
  [Ismartono] Has the Philippine Government ever tried to 
force 
you to cancel the conference? 
  [Constantino] Government officials have contacted us since 
last November, but they never tried to scuttle the conference 
and they only urged us to watch our step. As you know, 
preventing us from holding the meeting and voicing our views is 
against the Philippine Constitution. The Manila government is 
not stupid. They are only anxious to see that the conference 
should not be a one- sided affair with one party being put on 
the defensive. To counter this, I told them that we would 
invite officials from the Indonesian Embassy in Manila as well 
as government officials from Jakarta to ensure that the 
conference would be fully represented. 
  [Ismartono] Have you done this? 
  [Constantino] Not yet. When I made this proposal, Philippine 
officials became increasingly worried because they thought it 
would make things more complicated. Therefore, I decided not to 
extend the invitation to the Indonesian officials. 
  [Ismartono] Did you ever consider the impact of the 
conference on Indonesia-Philippines ties? 
  [Constantino] You mean bilateral relations will be strained? 
Well, it cannot be helped, but I hope that will not happen.

  [Text] Dili, East Timor (JP) -- Government troops have 
foiled a terror campaign launched by separatists that was 
intended to coincide with a seminar on East Timor in Manila, the 
military says. 
  Colonel Johny Lumintang, military commandant overseeing 
security in East Timor, told journalists that the rebels 
attacked citizens' houses and "ambushed people in the streets". 
  He put the number of those involved at "no less than 300" 
but 
declined to explain how the troops had dealt with them. 
  He said the separatists meant to use the planned Manila 
seminar on East Timor to make the world aware of their existence. 
  "The clandestine movement's activities are confined to 
distributing anti-government and pro-Fretilin [Revolutionary 
Front for an Independent East Timor] (secession movement) 
brochures," Lumintang said. 
  Recently, a number of separatists held an anti-integration 
demonstration at Hotel Mahkota in Dili where a group of visiting 
foreign journalists stayed, he said. 
  He said some of the demonstrators were arrested.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali 
Alatas, who suffered a minor heart attack last week, is said to 
be recovering but will remain hospitalized for some time. 
  Alatas, 61, has been removed from Medistra Hospital's 
Intensive Cardiac Care Unit since Saturday to a private room, 
the hospital's public relations officer said yesterday. 
  Roos Jusuf Razak told THE JAKARTA POST that Alatas needed 
plenty of rest and was not in a condition to receive any 
visitors. 
  The minister was admitted to the hospital on May 22. Doctors 
then said he was suffering from fatigue and had to rest for the 
next two weeks. 
  "Mrs. Alatas has been trying to limit the number of 
visitors. 
Now, only the minister's family has been permitted to see him. 
The family apologizes for this," Roos said. 
  On Monday, however, President Suharto made a visit and 
became 
the only guest allowed in besides his family, she said. 
  Roos said that Mrs. Alatas, who has been accompanying her 
husband since he entered the hospital, has continually received 
guests and messages of sympathy from around the world. 
  A security guard at the hospital said Alatas' guests 
included 
officials from foreign embassies and government officials. He 
said Alatas also received "hundreds of bouquets" and more than a 
guests- book full of visitors. 
  Alatas' spokesman Irawan Abidin told THE JAKARTA POST there 
had not been any confirmation from the minister's doctors on 
when Alatas was permitted to leave the hospital. 
  "For now, we will keep to the doctor's initial prescription, 
in which he was ordered a two-week rest," he said. 
  Dr. Pattiasina of the Gatot Subroto Central Army Hospital 
who 
has the authority to give information on Alatas' health, refused 
to give details. 
  "He is doing fine," he said shortly, adding that he was 
given 
strict orders not to say more. 
  "I've been receiving reporters since last week, but I did 
not 
tell them anything," he said heroically. "In fact, I got tired 
of them and threw one out of my office."

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The powerful Armed Forces (ABRI) 
lost its best speakers, Major General Raja Kami Sembiring 
Meliala and Maj. Gen. Samsudin, when it withdrew 18 of its 100 
appointees at the House of Representatives yesterday. 
  The two men have played a major role in not only improving 
the image of the House, which has been besmirched as a rubber 
stamp institution, but also in proving that ABRI, too, can 
become a democratic force. 
  They were among a handful army officers in the House who 
championed a more open political climate. 
  Together with Brigadier General Rukmini Kusumostuti Sujono 
and Maj. Gen. Syaiful Sulun, both removed in 1992, ABRI had an 
outspoken quartet who pioneered the democratization process from 
their seats in the House. 
  From the first days of their service in 1987, they barraged 
government officials with embarrassing questions on subjects 
ranging from the eviction of the poor to make way for 
development projects and the lack of service given by the 
bureaucracy to tax payers. 
  The legislators will be remembered as army officers who 
dared 
to express opinions which were not always in line with ABRI's 
official views. 
  Sembiring, a former Cendrawasih Military commander 
overseeing 
security in Maluku and Irian Jaya, was a voice for the poor 
displaced from their homes to make way for development projects. 
  His dismissal from the legislative body comes six months 
after he made critical remarks about the appointment of the 
first civilian, Harmoko, to the top spot of the government's 
Golkar [Functional Group] political grouping. 
  Suharto's choice of Harmoko was widely interpreted as a sign 
that the guard is changing in Indonesian politics and that more 
civilians will follow the information minister into areas once 
considered the provenance of the military. 
  Sembiring's reaction was a swift defense of ABRI's central 
role, saying that no one could become president without a 
military background. 
  As for Samsudin, he was transferred from his post as 
chairman 
of House Commission II [Roman numeral number two] overseeing 
domestic political affairs to Commission VII on banking and 
industry, where his voice is rarely heard. 
  Rukmini, who retired from active service in ABRI is more 
popular among seminar attendants, where she is almost always a 
star speaker. And she has remained ABRI's faithful salesperson, 
defending the military's dual function. 
  She is also a member of the National Commission on Human 
Rights, which came to life last year. 
  Syaiful Sulun has practically stepped out of the political 
arena, making no public appearances since losing his legislative 
seat in 1992. 
  He stung the bureaucracy and stunned the public when during 
a 
nationally televised interview he complained that press 
criticism should be directed more at the executive than the 
legislative body. 
  Observers believe his unforgivable sin was his daring move 
to 
talk with the Petisi 50 [Petition of 50], a loose organization 
of former government and military officials that is harshly 
critical of the government. 
  The past two years have been difficult for the military, 
with 
their "dual function" in both security and politics coming under 
intense scrutiny. 
  As critics have increasingly questioned its relevance, 
governmnt and military officials as well as political party 
leaders have been just as busy defending it. 
  They question the privilege because it is unclear who they 
represent. 
  "People criticize (the dual function) because they don't 
care 
to study the nation's struggle, especially the history of ABRI," 
President Suharto said last August two weeks before the 
incumbent House members were sworn in. 
  One hundred of the 500 seats in the House are reserved for 
the military in recognition of its role as the "stabilizing and 
dynamizing" force in the Indonesian politics forged by political 
leaders in the 1960s. 
  The remaining 400 seats are contested by the three 
sanctioned 
political organizations the government-backed Golkar, the 
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the United Development 
Party (PPP) through the general election. 
  The number of seats granted to the military has been at the 
center of debate. Outspoken politician Sri Bintang Pamungkas of 
the PPP has argued that while he agrees that ABRI deserves a 
place in the House, the number of seats should be reduced.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Somsavat Lengsavat </F>
by unidentified station correspondent on the outcome of the 
four-day official visit to Laos by Kang Song-san, premier of the 
Administrative Committee of the DPRK; place and date not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] This is the first visit to our country by the 
premier of the DPRK. In the past, it was the DPRK president who 
paid a visit to our country. Though the visit was short, it 
brought about good results. Premier Kang Song-san himself said 
before his departure that he was very satisfied with the outcome 
of his visit on this occasion. He also expressed thanks to our 
party and government leaders as well as our people for the warm 
welcome accorded him and his delegation in an honorable manner 
throughout the visit. 
  Following the visit, our two sides have further understood 
each other's situation. We also exchanged views on 
international and regional issues of common interest. Our Lao 
side also has come to understand further the DPRK's views on the 
problem of building the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free 
zone of peace and stability. Noteworthy is that following the 
visit, the two sides have unanimously agreed to cooperate in the 
economic, scientific, and technical fields in the immediate 
future. Regarding economic cooperation, Comrade Premier Kang 
Song-san himself expressed the determination of the Korean side 
to do its utmost to cooperate with the Lao side to bring about 
fruitful achievements. At present, the DPRK has sent a number 
of experts to Laos to collect information on climatic and other 
fields in order to facilitate fruitful achievements in the 
economic cooperation between the two countries. We are convinced 
that the cooperation will be favorably developed in the future. 
Specifically stipulated in the signed agreement is the 
cooperation in agricultural, the integrated wood processing, and 
the mining exploitation fields.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the 7 June PASASON: "Hail Success of the </F>
Visit to Our Country by Premier of the DPRK Administrative 
Council"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of Comrade Khamtai Siphandon, 
prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR], 
Comrade Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administrative 
Council, led a high-level delegation from the DPRK to pay an 
official, friendship visit to the LPDR from 3 to 6 June. 
Comrade Kang Song-san and his delegation were accorded a warm 
welcome of comradeship and fraternity by Comrade Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon and Lao people in all places the delegation 
visited. 
  During the visit, Comrade Kang Song-san and his delegation 
paid a courtesy call on Comrade Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of 
the LPDR. The call proceeded in an atmosphere of profound 
cordiality and friendship. The DPRK delegation also visited 
various places of economic and cultural significance in the 
capital and Vientiane Province. Official talks between a 
high-level LPDR delegation of led by Comrade Khamtai Siphandon 
and the high-level DPRK delegation led by Comrade Kang Song-san 
were held at the Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane. In the 
talks which proceeded in an atmosphere of close friendship and 
profound mutual understanding, the two sides informed each other 
of the outstanding situations in their respective countries. 
They also expressed their definite intention to further 
promote, expand, and strengthen, ever more fruitfully, the 
friendly relations and cooperation in the economic and other 
fields. Noteworthy is that during the visit, the two sides 
signed an agreement on the economic, scientific, and technical 
cooperation between the Lao and Korean Governments. The 
agreement was signed in furtherance of the implementation of the 
protocol on economic, scientific, and technical cooperation 
between the two countries. The protocol was signed in Pyongyang 
on 10 December 1993 on the occasion of the visit to the DPRK by 
our Lao high-level party and state delegation led by Comrade 
Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon. Stipulated in the said 
agreement are various DPRK cooperation projects of various 
fields in the LPDR, such as the cooperation projects in the 
areas of agriculture, mining industry, wood processing industry, 
and the construction of hydroelectric works which will begin in 
certain provinces in the northern region and in the plain of the 
central region in the subsequent years. 
  The success of this visit to the LPDR by the premier of the 
DPRK Administrative Council has brought about new steps of 
development in the long-standing, good relations and 
cooperation, in particular in the economic field and between the 
parties, states, and peoples of Laos and Korea. The Lao people 
would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of the 
high-level DPRK delegation in this visit to the LPDR. The Lao 
people pledge to do their utmost to, together with the fraternal 
Korean people, contribute to fruitfully promoting and expanding 
and increasingly developing the existing good, friendly 
relations and cooperation between the parties, states, and 
peoples of Laos and Korea as well as to translating into reality 
the agreement on the economic, scientific, and technical 
cooperation. This will bring about benefits to the two peoples 
of Laos and Korea and contribute to promoting and establishing 
peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation among various 
countries in the Asia- Pacific region and the rest of the world.

  [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] is keeping a 
hands-off policy on the issue of whether or not to release 
captured communist leader Felimon Lagman. President Ramos says 
he leaves it up to the court to decide whether or not to free 
Lagman. 
  He made his statement during an audience he gave to the 
family of slain Police Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal. Zarcal 
was killed on 7 May allegedly by the rebel hit squad Alex 
Boncayao Brigade [ABB], which Lagman is the alleged head. 
  Defense Secretary Renato De Villa said earlier the 
government 
was not inclined to unilaterally release Lagman as it did to 
another communist leader Wilma Tiamzon. Tiamzon had been freed 
on humanitarian and medical reasons. 
  Several sectors including Congress have asked for Lagman's 
temporary release but military, police, and justice authorities 
said they were still evaluating Lagman's case in terms of 
security.

<F P=106> [By Bernie C. Perez] </F>
  [Text] Davao City -- The Davao City Government, in 
coordination with the Private Investments and Trade 
Opportunities-Philippines (PITO-P), has identified the list of 
preferred investment areas (PIAs) to further lure local and 
foreign businessmen to the area. 
  BUSINESS WORLD learned PIAs included under the "Invest in 
Davao" project are classified into five major groupings, namely, 
agri-business, tourism and recreation, manufacturing and 
assembly, transshipment infrastructure, and property development. 
  The Invest in Davao project is a short-term (three years) 
development scheme for the city. It has a fund of P37 million 
[Philippine pesos] of which P20 million was pledged by the city 
government and P17 million from PITO-P. 
  The Service Group, a Washington-based consultancy group, was 
also used to conduct the study or assessment on the investment 
climate in Davao. 
  Being the biggest producer of agricultural products, a 
reason 
Davao was dubbed as the "Fruit Basket of the Philippines," the 
city plays an important role in enhancing the agri-based 
industry. 
  Agri-business development in the area focuses on fruit 
processing using dehydration, vacuum or spray technologies, and 
canned specialty vegetables. 
  The potential is large for the agriculture and agri-based 
industries in Davao and in the whole of Mindanao due to the 
relatively favorable climate throughout the year, available 
skilled and professional manpower supply, high literacy rate, 
and low cost of labor. 
  Davao City's role as the regional commercial center will be 
boosted anew with Mindanao gearing up to become one of Asia's 
tourist destinations. 
  Records show that within six years, tourist arrivals in 
Davao 
jumped to 193,000 last year from 150,000 in 1987, a reason to 
develop international standard hotels and beach resorts, sports 
complexes, recreational facilities such as golf courses, and 
marine/wildlife parks. 
  The manufacturing sector earmarks potential investment areas 
in garments, footwear, toys, bulky kitchen and house wares, 
among others. There is also a need to invest in common and 
bonded warehouses to support agricultural productivity. 
  Roberto Arquiza, Invest in Davao assistant project manager, 
told BUSINESS WORLD there is a need to develop the manufacturing 
industry in Davao. "In spite of the rapid progress of the area 
(Davao), most of the goods are still coming from Manila," he 
said. 
  Councilor Aristeo Albay, chairman of the city council urban 
planning and development committee, added, "It's about time that 
Davao develop its manufacturing industry so that it will be less 
dependent from Manila." 
  In terms of transshipment infrastructure, there are seven 
private piers operating in Davao. Four investors (two Filipino 
shippers, a Greek firm, and a British company) have also shown 
interest to set up shipping operations in Davao. 
  The Greek shipping company, Hellenic Shipyard of Perama 
S.A., 
is also planning to improve the maritime school by upgrading the 
teaching facilities. 
  With the rise in industries and business activities in Davao 
City, investments are needed to finance the construction of more 
commercial office buildings, residential villages, industrial 
estates, and convention/seminar centers. 
  As a come-on for prospective investors, the city government 
included in the investment priority plan provisions for fiscal 
and non-fiscal incentives. 
  These privileges are in addition to incentives granted by 
law 
and the Local Government Code. 
  The incentives provide that a new enterprise will be fully 
exempt from mayor's permit fees, building permit fees, and local 
business tax imposed by city ordinances. The incentives are 
good for two years from the start of commercial operation. 
  There will also be tax reductions in the gross sales or 
receipts taxable base for a given period after a tax holiday. 
<H5>  Deductions </H5>
  The following deductions for business sales taxes will be 
allowed as deductions from gross receipts during the preceding 
calendar year for three years starting from the date of 
registration: 
  -- a non-cumulative operating loss equivalent to 25 percent 
of losses of the preceding year as indicated in the financial 
statement submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue; 
  -- 20 percent of expenditures from annual wages paid to 
newly 
hired employees who are residents of Davao City; 
  -- 25 percent of expenditures on infrastructure and/or 
facilities built by investors which are accessible to and used 
by the public; and, 
  -- 25 percent of expenditures on human resource/skills 
training based on a training program. 
  There are also incentives on real property tax (RPT) such as 
tax exemption for two years from the start of commercial 
operation, reduced RPT rates for new investors for two years, 
and two-year exemption on machinery and equipment used for 
pollution control.

  [Text] Policemen maintained their ranking as the top 
suspects in human rights violations nationwide although a 
decline in the number of cases has been noted. 
  Policemen were named as the alleged perpetrators in 118, or 
51 percent, of 232 human rights cases filed before the 
Commission on Human Rights (CHR) from January to March 1994, a 
CHR report revealed yesterday. 
  The report approved for release by Human Rights Commission 
Chairman Sedfrey Ordonez, said local officials and employees 
placed a far second for being charged in 29 or 12.5 percent of 
the cases. They displaced the military who were charged in 19 or 
8.2 percent of the cases. 
  The CHR earlier ranked the police as the top suspects in 
human rights complaints last year, with the military placing a 
far second and local officials and employees a far third. 
  But Interior and Local Government Undersecretary Alexander 
Aguirre reacted to the report, saying the number of human rights 
cases against policemen merely reflected the nature of police 
work, which require the arrest, detention, maiming or killing of 
crime suspects in defense of public safety. 
  The latest CHR report also noted a decline in the incidents 
of human rights violations actually occurring this year, from 75 
in January to 50 in February and 33 in March. 
  Of these, 22 were murder, homicide and execution cases while 
the rest were illegal arrests and detention (17), rape (4), 
disappearances (3), torture (1) and other complains (115). 
Other suspects in human rights cases were civilians (11 cases), 
workers (6), professionals (4), paramilitary forces (3), New 
People's Army (2), other rebel groups (1) and other sectors (39). 
  Metro Manila topped the list of regions with the highest 
number of human rights cases with 48, followed by Central Luzon 
and Eastern Visayas (40 each), Southern Mindanao (38), Western 
Visayas (37), Central Visayas (32), Cagayan Valley and Western 
Mindanao (29 each), and Central Mindanao (nine). 
  Civilians topped the list of human rights victims, being 
named as such in 53 cases, followed by workers (41) and 
children, youth and women (29). 
  Meanwhile, the CHR announced it has released over P 
[Philippine pesos] 1 million in financial assistance to 137 
human rights victims in the first quarter of 1994. 
  Ordonez told reporters most of the money, or P970,000 went 
to 
97 beneficiaries as survivors' benefits, while P75,000 went to 
the medical needs of 15 beneficiaries, P4,340 went to the 
incidental and medical expenses of 23 others and the remaining 
P6,000 to two persons availing of the government witness 
protection program.

  [Text] Despite a projected P30.6 billion [Philippine pesos] 
deficit for 1994, the national government improved on its fiscal 
position in the first quarter of the year with a P13 billion 
surplus in actual revenues and disbursement. 
  This was made possible by a P1.3 billion increase in revenue 
collections and a savings of P11.7 billion from actual expenses 
during the period. 
  Statistics from the Bureau of Treasury showed that as of 30 
April 1994, actual collections reached P113.8 billion or P1.3 
billion more than the P112.5 billion in programmed revenues for 
the first quarter. 
  Collections by the Bureau of Customs were P1.8 billion 
higher 
than the P25.2 billion it expected to generate. 
  Other revenue agencies also increased their take by P1.8 
billion to P13.5 billion from the programmed P11.7 billion. 
  But the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) failed to realize 
its target revenues of P68.2 billion for the first quarter of 
the year, generating only P66.5 billion, or a P1.7 billion 
shortfall. 
  The Bureau of Treasury also fell last 16 May following the 
approval of the expanded VAT [value-added tax]. 
  The national government deficit according to the new budget 
proposal will be P16.4 billion, compared to the P49.2 billion 
estimate made last December. 
  Under the new program, the national government is even 
expected to have a P15.5 billion surplus but would have to 
resort to borrowings to absorb the P31.9 billion liabilities of 
the old Central Bank. 
  The December estimates had the national government in the 
red 
by P22.7 billion to finance operations and would have to raise 
P26.5 billion more for the rehabilitation of the Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP). 
  The government deficit is expected to reach P30.6 billion by 
year's end, with P4.7 billion from daily operations and P25.9 
billion to save the BSP. 
  Three adjustments in the fiscal program were made in 
reducing 
the proposed budget. 
  -- Reduction of the debt amortization estimates to consider 
the rollover of P36.3 billion in FRTNs [floating rate treasury 
notes] and Treasury bills which were previously assumed to be 
redeemed in 1995. 
  -- Scaling down of the budgetary support to government 
corporations in consonance with the policy of reducing 
assistance of GOCCs [government owned or controlled 
corporations] by 10 percent in 1995. 
  -- Absorption into the Internal Revenue Allotment of the 
provisions for the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers devolved 
to local government units. 
  The biggest cut was for debt appropriation, followed by the 
special purpose funds, subsidy to government corporations, funds 
for flagship projects, department/agencies budget and support 
for local government units. 
  In the December estimate, the government was to appropriate 
P155.1 billion for debt servicing but this was reduced to P109.4 
billion. This year's budget for servicing is P117.8 billion. 
  The compensation adjustment fund, initially earmarked at P25 
billion so government could dramatically increase wages of civil 
servants, was slashed by P3 billion in the new proposal. 
  Despite the cut, appropriations for salary increases were 
still at least 300 percent higher than the P9.3 billion allotted 
for 1994. 
  Enriquez said only five departments -- Science and 
Technology, Tourism, Energy, Budget and Management, and HUDCC 
(Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council) -- 
submitted budget proposals within the ceilings approved by the 
president and the Cabinet. 
  Of the total budget proposals, P30.6 billion were in excess 
of the prescribed ceiling. 
  Preliminary results of the technical budget hearings showed 
that the education department would still be given the biggest 
slice of the budget with an appropriation of P41.7 billion, P5.1 
billion less than the agency's proposal of P46.8 billion. 
  Public works and highways was allotted P23.7 billion (P5.8 
billion less; national defense P23.1 billion (P2.4 billion 
less); and, interior and local governments P14.7 billion (P1.8 
billion less). 
  Enriquez told the president that proposals in excess of 
ceilings which were already approved by the Cabinet had made the 
preparation of the budget more difficult. 
  "Unless the departments voluntarily reduce their proposals, 
DBM [Department of Budget and Management], in consultation with 
the president, will have to assert its authority to maintain the 
approved budget program," he said. 
  "Agencies who submitted proposals grossly in excess of the 
ceilings cannot expect favorable action on their requests," he 
added.

  [Text] According to a correspondent's report, on 2 June 
Surin Deputy Governor Phanat Sakuntanat signed an announcement 
opening the border trading point at Chom Pass, Kap Choeng 
District on 4 June. This trading point has been closed and 
reopened several times due to fighting in nearby parts of 
Cambodia. 
  Meanwhile, a source familiar with the Cambodian border in 
Surin Province noted that kidnapping of Thai citizens for ransom 
was mostly the result of business blackmail, not hunger. The 
problem of Cambodian bandits robbing Thais existed long before 
border points were opened for trading.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has 
reaffirmed to France the government's policy that supplying 
weapons to Cambodian government troops is not the solution to 
ending Phnom Penh's conflict with the Khmer Rouge. 
  Surin met French Ambassador Jacques Rummelhardt on Thursday. 
  Three Western countries -- France, the United States and 
Australia -- are considering a Cambodian request to provide 
military aid, including weapons, to help fight the Khmer Rouge. 
  "During the discussion, I inform the French envoy that the 
Thai position towards the request is that the supply of weapons 
will not end the Cambodian conflict and it is not a suitable 
solution," said Surin. 
  Members of the Cambodian government have reiterated calls 
for 
weaponry to attack the guerrillas after roundtable talks in 
North Korea, called by King Norodom Sihanouk, failed to reach a 
settlement. 
  The participants agreed to set up a joint committee which is 
scheduled to meet for the first time on June 15 in Phnom Penh. 
  First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh declared at 
Pochentong airport upon arrival from Pyongyang that war between 
the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge is unavoidable. 
Cambodia's foreign minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut, has toured 
England and France, reportedly to request weapons. 
  Meanwhile, a high-ranking government source yesterday 
confirmed reports that Malaysia has supplied munitions to 
Cambodian troops. 
  "It is widely known in Phnom Penh that Kuala Lumpur has 
supplied munitions to Cambodia in recent months," he said. 
  However, the source said, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed had told Prime Minister Chuan Likphai recently that 
supplying weapons was not the way to end Cambodia's civil war. 
  The source noted that Western countries which have been 
approached for aid are having second thoughts. 
  "Military aid does not mean only weapons, but also a 
military 
training programme for the ill-disciplined Cambodian troops in 
various fields," he said. 
  The same source said that the West had no assurance that 
weapons they supply would not be sold by the underpaid Cambodian 
troops, even to the Khmer Rouge. Thailand has also expressed 
deep concern that the weapons would be brought across the border 
onto its soil. 
  The United States sent representatives to Phnom Penh last 
month to observe the situation there before making any decision 
on the aid request. The Phnom Penh Post reported the U.S. has, 
however, already decided to send about 90 mine removal experts 
and engineers to Cambodia, and that an advanced team had already 
arrived.

Thailand of supporting the Khmer Rouge [KR] based on old 
information and records. 
  Adm. Prachet says that Thai Armed Forces have abided by the 
Government policy. He says: While the Thai Government 
maintains strict noninterference policy in armed conflicts in 
Cambodia, the Armed Forces have observed the policy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "ASEAN Must Not Water Down ILO Safeguards for </F>
Workers"] 
  [Text] As the International Labour Organization opened its 
81st annual conference in Geneva yesterday, ASEAN officials were 
preparing to table a resolution that would condemn Western 
attempts to link trade with labour standards. 
  The resolution will also call on the UN agency to review 
some 
of its labour standards which ASEAN delegates claim are not 
based on norms and values of developing countries. 
  But ASEAN's most urgent concern is to win an assurance from 
the ILO that it will strongly resist the introduction of new 
conditions binding social clauses and ILO labour standards with 
market accessibility. 
  The issue of workers' rights has become particularly 
sensitive for ASEAN countries, most of which are on a US 
watchlist for alleged labour violations. 
<H5>  `Social dumping' </H5>
  At March's final meeting of the General Agreement of Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) in Marrakesh the issue almost scuttled the 
signing of the new World Trade Organization as developing 
nations fought off a US and French bid to include labour rights 
in the new global trade treaty. 
  The basis of the West's complaint is "social dumping" -- a 
belief that the lower wages paid to poorer people in developing 
countries means that firms are able to compete unfairly against 
employers in more advanced lands, who must provide more benefits 
for their workers. ASEAN leaders, whose countries have 
prospered as sources of cheap labour, claim this as a disguised 
form of protectionism. 
  ASEAN officials were correct to resist the insertion of 
social clauses in a world trade pact because they are protecting 
the right of their workers to sell their labour on the 
international market, much in the same way as the West seeks 
open markets in the East to sell its goods and services. 
  But what is alarming about the ASEAN push is that the 
regional bloc also seems intent on watering down international 
safeguards for the protection of workers' rights including 
unionization, safety requirements and basic wages. 
  Thailand, which has traditionally been more deferential in 
dealing with Western pressure over worker's rights than 
neighbours like Malaysia and Singapore, is becoming more and 
more vocal on the issue. 
  While it is encouraging to see Thailand become more 
assertive 
in the international arena it is unfortunate it has chosen an 
area where it has such a bleak record. After coming off a year 
in which it posted a record for the number industrial accidents 
including the world's worst ever factory fire, it would have 
been hoped Thailand would be more circumspect about lending its 
support to an attempt to lower safeguards for the rest of the 
world's workers. 
  Only last Tuesday, the ILO denounced forced child labour and 
prostitution in Thailand, and urged the government to take steps 
to end it. 
  The report, based on an ILO mission here last September, 
said 
children in Thailand continued to be forcibly recruited for work 
in factories, sweatshops or brothels in Bangkok and in the 
provinces, adding: "...illegal shops exist by the thousands". 
  "The situation is often linked to forced or false 
recruitment, deception and trafficking," it said. "Children are 
exploited because they are young and helpless, they are deprived 
of the right to lead a normal childhood, deprived of education, 
deprived of a future." 
  The same day as the report came out, police raided a 
Thonburi 
sweat shop where 30 girls, some of whom had been there four 
years, were being forced to work 16 hours a day without pay. On 
being freed, the girls told tales of being beaten regularly and 
fed rotten food. 
<H5>  Venal and brutal employers </H5>
  Clearly there is much that needs to be done to curb the 
excesses of venal and brutal Thai employers. 
  Last week, the United Nations singled out Thailand, along 
with a dozen other countries, for the tremendous development it 
had achieved over the last three decades. Much of that success 
has been due to the fact that Thai workers were willing to toil 
harder and longer for less pay and in worse conditions than 
their counterparts in other part of the world. Thai employers 
have grown rich beyond all expectations and the lives of workers 
have also improved but there is still much more than can be done 
before Thailand can be proud of its labour record. 
  The government is right to take action to protect the Thai 
economy from dubiously-intentioned foreign efforts to constrain 
it. But it should not use this position as a pretext to deny 
Thai workers the rewards and conditions they have labored hard 
to earn or to weaken the little protection ILO standards offer 
the rest of the world's workers.

  [Text] Permanent Secretary of the Interior Ministry Ari 
Wong-araya granted an interview to newsmen at Government House 
this afternoon. Asked about the Iranian Government's protest, 
through the Thai ambassador to Iran, about Thailand's arrest of 
Iranians suspected of preparing and transporting C-4 explosive 
for sabotage at the Israeli Embassy, the permanent secretary 
said it was difficult for him to comment since this might affect 
relations. Besides, the permanent secretary said he still knew 
nothing about the protest. 
  Asked whether it would be possible for Iranian diplomats to 
meet the suspects, he said this would be up to the police. He 
said the diplomats can call on the suspects to provide them with 
a lawyer should he be arrested. However, he said, he was not 
sure if there really had been a protest as he had seen nothing 
to that effect. 
  Ari said legal proceedings against the suspects will be 
based 
on Thai law because the incident took place in Thailand. He 
said the suspects might not be granted bail if there is no 
guarantee of security. He said that under Thai law, Iran cannot 
seek extradition for trial in Iran. He is confident the police 
will adhere to Thai law, particularly as the case is considered 
an important one involving national security. He noted that the 
police have followed quite proper and thorough procedures. The 
police are speeding up the investigation for the result of the 
case.

  [Excerpt] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan 
yesterday denied reports Tehran had protested the arrest of 
three Iranians suspected of involvement in the recent attempt to 
blow up the Israeli Embassy. 
  Iran's Foreign Ministry "invited" the Thai ambassador to 
Tehran for a meeting "to let him know" it wanted Iranian 
diplomats stationed in Bangkok granted access to visit the 
suspects, said Mr. Surin. 
  "There was no accusing, no anger or protest," he said. The 
Thai Foreign Ministry has conveyed Iran's message to the 
Interior Ministry, said the deputy minister. 
  The three suspects -- Hossein Shahriari Far, Babak Taheri, 
and Basr Kazemi are being held at the police training school in 
Bang Khen District, northern Bangkok. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The suppression drive launched by the Burmese 
government in an area opposite Chiang Rai Province is directed 
against opium warlord Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) forces, not 
democratic groups in Shan State, Office of the Narcotic Control 
Board secretary-general Chawalit Yotmani said yesterday. 
  Pol Gen Chawalit said Khun Sa's struggle was not a 
democratic 
cause. 
  He said narcotics traffickers who were recently arrested in 
Chiang Mai Province and had ammunition seized were Khun Sa's 
subordinates and should not be called "fighters for democracy". 
  The ammunition was intended for exchange with drugs, he 
said, 
adding he had no idea where they came from. 
  Academics have proposed that measures be put in place to 
control the ethics of politicians, but Pol Gen Chawalit thought 
the moral standards of MPs could improve gradually. 
  He said it was beyond his responsibilities to comment on 
what 
should be done to prevent politicians from becoming involved in 
the narcotics trade. 
  He also said the committee responsible for drafting the 
anti-money laundering bill had already met once and would meet 
again this Monday. 
  It was agreed at the first meeting that the legislation 
should deal initially with "dirty money" acquired through the 
narcotics trade, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Weak Diplomacy"] </F>
  [Text] Thailand's image in the eyes of foreign countries 
appears to have suffered a great deal. There is the internal 
pressure created by the hunger strike and associated protests. 
Regarding external pressure, the International Labor 
Organization [ILO] condemns child labor and child prostitution, 
and the United States views Thailand suspiciously concerning 
support for the Khmer Rouge in its fight against the Cambodian 
Government. 
  We devoted our attention to the United States for 40 years 
during the cold war by standing alongside it during three wars 
in Korea, Indochina, and the Persian Gulf. The U.S. suspicion 
could strongly impact on Thailand and indicates its inclination 
to support the Cambodian Government to suppress the Khmer Rouge. 
This situation will result in prolonged fighting and make 
Thailand suffer. 
  The U.S. Department of State's position, as expressed 
through 
its spokeswoman Christine Shelley, clearly shows the victory 
scored by Cambodia's diplomacy -- its ability to persuade the 
superpower, which is an ally of Thailand, to believe that 
Thailand was giving support to the Khmer Rouge fighting machine. 
On another angle, the fact that the U.S. Department of State 
did not believe that Thailand did not support the Khmer Rouge 
and the fact that the ILO blatantly criticized Thailand at the 
Geneva conference demonstrated that Thai diplomacy has failed 
completely in international circles. 
  We urge the government to give higher priority to foreign 
policy as well as to all forms of foreign contacts and efforts 
to improve our national image. The prime minister himself must 
visit major countries more frequently. It is clear that it is 
not enough to let the foreign minister go it alone. We must 
accept that our diplomacy is weak. 
  It is worth noting that the United States currently views 
Thailand with little satisfaction. This is clearly reflected in 
the attitude of U.S. envoy Lambertson and by former envoy 
Abramowitz whose article in THE WASHINGTON POST was directly 
critical of Thailand. In addition, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher may criticize Thailand while he is here to 
attend the upcoming ASEAN meeting. 
  We must try our utmost to convince the world that Thailand 
does not support the Khmer Rouge. We, however, should not 
prevent the United States from helping the Cambodian Government 
if that is what it wants to do. As a junior friend, we should 
only remind it of the consequences of falling into a quagmire as 
it once did in the Vietnam war.

  [Text] Deputy Permanent Secretary for Public Health 
Chamrun Mikhanon says he accepts that Thailand has made mistakes 
in handling AIDS projects in the past. 
  He was speaking at the closing ceremony of the four-day 
Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC) 
International Symposium for Capacity Enhancement in Primary 
Health Care and HIV/AIDS Management, attended by 24 countries. 
  "We are confident we will not repeat those mistakes," Dr 
Chamrun said. 
  Dr Chamrun was referring to a lack of know-how and proper 
methods for handling the spread of the deadly disease. 
  He agreed that developing countries must share technical 
know-how and resources. 
  "We are looking forward to convincing government and 
non-government organisations to take necessary action to 
strengthen management, technical cooperation internally and 
internationally and mobilise experts," he said. 
  The meeting focused on four main issues, distribution of 
condoms, integration of HIV/AIDS care with primary health care, 
monitoring and evaluation and behavioural change. 
  The participants also noted that funding from overseas for 
HIV/AIDS programmes is usually short-term and it was difficult 
for a country to sustain after the end of outside assistance. 
  For evaluation and implementation purposes, additional 
funding is necessary.

  [Text] THE political scene grew more volatile yesterday 
after prominent figures formed a task force to back hunger 
striker Chalat Worachat, with strong support from hardliners in 
the Phalang Tham Party. 
  An unlikely alliance also appeared to be taking shape 
between 
the newly formed "Thai Political Reform Organization" and 
opposition parties, which the pro-democracy movement toppled 
from power in the 1992 uprising. 
  The second biggest opposition party, Chat Phatthana, sent a 
representative to attend the inauguration at Thammasat 
University of the Thai Political Reform Organization (TPRO), 
which brought together leading pro-democracy activists who 
called themselves "Friends of Chalat". 
  A Phalang Tham hardliner, who did not want to be named, 
claimed the pro-Chalat movement was lobbying for the 
opposition's support. He said yesterday's development was part 
of a collaboration to isolate the ruling Democrat Party, which 
has rejected as impractical Chalat's demand for a totally new 
Constitution drafted by the House of Representatives. 
  A key member of the New Aspiration Party, the Democrats' 
most 
powerful ally, also joined the expanding campaign for a new 
charter. Deputy NAP [New Aspiration Party] leader Wira 
Musikaphong, who has been rumoured to be planning to defect to 
Phalang Tham, became one of 21 core members of the TPRO. 
  Yesterday was the ninth day of Chalat's hunger strike. 
Doctors who examined him said his condition had stabilized 
after the activist collapsed earlier this week. But they 
expressed concern that constant intravenous feeding of a glucose 
and saline solution could lead to a state of shock. 
  Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang made his strongest 
show 
of support yet for Chalat yesterday and criticized the 
government for claiming that the only way to comply with 
Chalat's demand was to stage a coup against itself and abolish 
the present Constitution. 
  "Chalat has floated an intriguing idea for us, but people 
said a coup is the only way to implement it. How can we achieve 
full democracy with this kind of attitude?" Chamlong said. 
  He echoed Chalat's statements that present charter, no 
matter 
how much it is altered, will always remain a legacy of the 
military junta. 
  The government has insisted that the present charter 
prohibits the drafting of a new charter. The only way to 
promulgate a new Constitution is to amend the present charter to 
remove the obstacles, which is politically impossible unless the 
opposition co-operates. 
  Chat Phatthana leader Chatchai Chunhawan, who had earlier 
suggested that Chalat's demand was not feasible, seemed to 
soften his stand yesterday and insisted that the government "is 
responsible for Chalat's life". 
  "Opposition parties have not yet discussed how to help 
Chalat," he said. 
  The Phalang Tham hardliners' increasingly active role in the 
Chalat affair has strained the party's relations with the 
Democrats. Former deputy Bangkok governor Chaiwat Sinsuwong, who 
triggered a Democrat uproar on Thursday with a strong anti-Chuan 
remark, is now a TPRO member. 
  But Mana Mahasuwerachai, a Phalang Tham MP who had tried to 
broker a solution between Chalat and the government, yesterday 
distanced himself from the activist, whom he implied had 
breached an agreement made earlier with the Democrats and was 
being manipulated by anti-government elements. 
  Other key TPRO members include San Hathirat, chairman of the 
pro-Chamlong Confederation for Democracy; Dr Weng Tochirakan, 
secretary general of the Campaign for Popular Democracy [CPD]; 
ex-student leader Prinya Tewanaruamitkun, the deputy CPD 
secretary-general; and Chalat's daughter, Chitrawadi Worachat. 
  Anti-government activities by branch members of political 
action groups such as the Confederation for Democracy and 
student unions were held in the major provinces yesterday. 
  In Khon Kaen, a panel discussion was held at a hotel with 
New 
Aspiration deputy leader Wira, Phalang Tham MP Chaiwat and rock 
singer Yunyong Ophakun as guest speakers. 
  They discussed plans to stage a mass demonstration in Khon 
Kaen and other northeastern provinces to support Chalat's cause. 
Later yesterday, they were to appear at a rally at a teachers' 
training college in Maha Sarakham province. 
  In the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, activist 
groups issued a statement praising Chalat for his "courage and 
sacrifice" to pressure the government to achieve fuller 
democracy in the shortest possible time. 
  At Thammasat University, when the TPRO was unveiled, the 
most 
upbeat speaker was one of the staunchest anti-government 
critics, controversial Sulak Siwalak. 
  "If the government can't reform the charter, we the people 
will do it ourselves," he said.

  [Text] THE Supreme Command spokesman denied yesterday that 
the military was contemplating any move in the face of the 
current political tensions in the country. 
  Spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, however, confirmed 
that a group of Thai military officers met in Hong Kong recently 
to discuss the current political situation. 
  "They did talk about politics but it did not amount to 
anything concrete," Anuson said. 
  Anuson was commenting on a press report that a group of 
senior military officers met secretly in Hong Kong early this 
week as domestic political tensions grew over Chalat Worachat's 
hunger strike. 
  "It was a coincidence," Anuson said of the Hong Kong 
meeting. 
The spokesman insisted that the military was not making any move 
in response to the political situation. 
  "The military just monitors the political situation. But it 
has no intention of making any move." 
  Anuson said the military believed that despite the tensions 
the political situation "poses no concerns". "There is nothing 
of concern yet. We don't anticipate any violence," he said.

  [Text] Since early this year, SCCI [State Commission for 
Cooperation and Investment] has licensed a total of 109 
projects, including many involving American investors. At a 
recent seminar held in Washington, American businessmen 
described Vietnam as an interesting market and many large 
companies have expressed their wish to operate in Vietnam. 
  Both Vietnamese and American leaders in their contact, 
reiterated to each other they want a full relationship as soon 
as possible. The decision to open liaison offices in the 
respective capitals of Vietnam and the U.S. has been welcomed by 
foreign business circle working in Hanoi. Mr. (?David Drinkerd), 
an American businessman of the Digital Company, considered it a 
correct and initial step for the normalization of the bilateral 
relations. He said the establishment of representation offices 
or embassies enables businessmen to have more information and 
more convenient conditions to run a business. For his part, Mr. 
(?John Lindon), director of an electronic company of Sweden in 
Hanoi, held that the new development in Vietnamese-U.S. 
relations created more favorable conditions for his company. He 
also predicted that there would be more U.S. companies coming to 
Vietnam, creating more market for his company's products. 
  Since the lifting of the embargo, Vietnam and the U.S. have 
taken many concrete steps. According to the Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, bilateral talks so far have been 
fruitful. By March 1994, 31 American companies were licensed to 
set up representative offices in Vietnam, 21 in Hanoi and 10 in 
Ho Chi Minh City.

<F P=106> [Unattributed essay: "The Important Landmark of the </F>
Traditional Relations Among Vietnam, Russia, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan"] 
  [Summary] "The upcoming official visit to Russia, Ukraine, 
and Kazakhstan by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will be 
an important landmark in the traditional relations of friendship 
between Vietnam and these member countries of the former Soviet 
Union now known as the Commonwealth of Independence States [CIS] 
as this will usher in a new era for consolidating, developing, 
and broadening the existing cooperation in various domains." 
  Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan once had close relations 
with 
Vietnam. "They contributed greatly to helping the Vietnamese 
people fight invading imperialist forces" for national defense. 
  "Following great political upheavals, which climaxed with 
the 
crumbling of the Soviet Union, the relations of cooperation 
between Vietnam and CIS member countries have become stunted 
somewhat because of the great difficulties encountered by these 
friendly countries. But the status of the friendships and the 
progress of international relations of cooperation in conformity 
with the epochal trend have become an indispensable demand of 
the peoples of our country and these friendly countries. 
  "We are very pleased to note that inheriting the traditional 
relations between the former Soviet Union and Vietnam, the 
Russian Federation has officially reestablished it diplomatic 
relations with Vietnam since January 1992. It has continued to 
help us complete the construction of various projects left 
unfinished by the former Soviet Union. Its relations of 
cooperation under the new format and new situation have been 
expanded to many new areas. The Vietnam-Russia 
Intergovernmental Commission for Economic, Trade, Scientific, 
and Technological Cooperation has been established and it has 
held three annual meetings. The two sides have signed a number 
of important documents such as the agreement on cooperation in 
the areas of communications, transportation, civil aviation, and 
maritime; the agreement on investment cooperation between the 
two countries; the agreement on investment protection and 
avoidance of double taxation; and the protocol on cooperation 
between the two countries' state banks and trade ministries. 
  "Russia has carried on the work of the former Soviet Union 
at 
the Vietsopetro oil joint enterprise and the Hoa Binh 
Hydroelectric Power Plant. It has helped upgrade various power 
plants. Direct relations of trade exchanges and economic 
cooperation under various forms such as partnerships and joint 
ventures between various localities of the two countries have 
also enjoyed favorable conditions. Now in Vietnam there have 
been many partnership enterprises and joint ventures between the 
two countries, whose status of operations is very satisfactory 
as it meets the needs, aspirations, and new conditions of each 
country. 
  "His Excellency Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yarov said in 
his recent visit to Vietnam that through its economic 
cooperation with Vietnam, the role of the Russian Federation in 
Southeast Asia has been asserted. And it is this cooperation 
that has contributed to consolidating peace and spurring 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and other countries 
in the region." 
  Vietnam and Ukraine have official established diplomatic 
relations since 23 January 1992. Many delegations from various 
echelons and sectors of the two countries have since exchanged 
visits to share views on various possible areas of cooperation. 
"During these visits, many cooperative agreements have been 
signed such as the agreement on exemption of visas for travel by 
citizens of the two countries, the agreement on the 
establishment of the Vietnam-Ukraine Intergovernmental 
Commission for Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological 
Cooperation, and so forth." 
  During his visit to Vietnam last April, the Ukrainian 
foreign 
minister expressed the fine sentiments of the government and 
people of Ukraine to Vietnam. He said: "Ukraine is very keen 
to develop its relations of cooperation with Vietnam." 
  As for the Central Asian Republic of Kazakhstan, it shares 
some similar features with Vietnam. Vietnam and Kazakhstan have 
established their diplomatic relations since 29 June 1992. "The 
two sides have exerted efforts to promote relations of 
cooperation in areas from which they have advantages such as the 
production of light industry goods, the cultivation and 
processing of tropical farm products, and the manufacture of 
spare parts for some machine tools." 
  It can be said that the first visit by Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet to Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan has been long expected 
by the three peoples. All the people assert that the potential 
for the development of relations of friendship between Vietnam 
and these countries is very great. It is their desire to 
jointly exploit this potential for their common, 
mutually-beneficial goal of contributing to the consolidation of 
world peace. 
  "It is because of this that the friendly visit of Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet will be of great significance as it will 
open up a new page in the relations of friendship among Vietnam, 
Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan."

<F P=106> [Report on Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam's speech at the </F>
foreign ministerial conference of nonaligned countries; from the 
"Commentary on Current Events" program] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Nguyen said affirmatively in his 
speech: Vietnam completely approves of the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] chairman's appraisal made in his report -- namely, under 
the present situation, we must work according to the NAM's basic 
goals and principles of peace, independence, sovereignty, 
equality, and development to further enhance the NAM's role. 
  On how the Asia-Pacific and Southeast Asian regions can 
realize those goals and principles, Foreign Minister Nguyen 
emphasized: The region has recently entered a new era in which 
the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation is having the 
upper hand and the tendency of dynamic and sustained development 
is full of promise. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen also pointed out: Some hidden 
factors of worrisome turbulence, such as conflict of interests 
and territorial disputes and claims, exist in the Asia-Pacific 
region, particularly in the East Sea area, the Korea peninsula, 
and Cambodia. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen pointed out: Recently, the East Sea 
area has witnessed some events that caused great worries to 
public opinion in the region and the world, particularly to 
Vietnam because these events happened on Vietnam's continental 
shelf and exclusive economic zone. International laws demand 
all countries to respect the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of others including their continental shelf and 
exclusive economic zones. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam reiterated Vietnam's 
sovereignty as a coastal country, and the Vietnamese people's 
determination to protect sovereignty over their continental 
shelf and exclusive economic zone in accordance with 
international laws, especially the 1982 UN Convention on the Sea. 
  During the conference, Foreign Minister Nguyen reaffirmed 
Vietnam's goodwill stance to settle all differences in 
accordance with the aforesaid principles. He appealed to all 
parties concerned to exercise self-restraint, and not to take 
any action to further complicate the situation. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen pointed out: The security and 
stability of the East Sea area is the common security and 
stability of the entire Asia-Pacific region, as well as one of 
the decisive factors for the safety of sea lanes and for the 
trade and development of one of the most active regions of the 
world. Vietnam urges all parties concerned to adhere to the 
aforesaid international laws to settle differences over the East 
Sea issue, which involves the interests of many countries. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen affirmed that Vietnam guarantees 
such 
an action. 
  On the human rights issue, Foreign Minister Nguyen pointed 
out: It is the people of each country who have the right to 
judge and push ahead the implementation of human rights in their 
own countries. No other government or organization will make 
decisions for them, even if the decision is made in the name of 
sincerity.

  [Text] Since March 1989, Haiphong municipality has helped 
to resettle more than 20,000 Vietnamese repatriated from abroad. 
Various international organizations have provided aid in kind 
and cash to help these people. Thus far, more than $7 million 
given by these organizations have been used to help them engage 
in some type of trade. 
  The province has also used more than $4.5 million to carry 
out more than 100 projects to help stabilize their daily life. 
These include projects in vocational training, improving public 
health, building schools, roads, bridges, and power stations; 
and promoting fishery and handicraft production and so forth. 
  During the past five years, Haiphong has launched programs 
to 
provide jobs for local workers, including 4,000 repatriated 
Vietnamese. The province's 25 vocational training centers have 
trained more than 7,800 repatriatees or 90 percent of those in 
the working age group. Many have been granted loans to set up 
their own businesses and they are doing well. 
  Haiphong has also closely coordinated with international 
organizations abroad and echelons and sectors at home to prevent 
and finally stop illegal departures by Vietnamese. It has made 
preparations to receive more repatriated Vietnamese and mapped 
out plans to help them quickly stabilize their daily life and to 
settle in with the local community.

  [Summary] "The Ninth National Assembly's fifth session 
entered its 11th day today. In the morning, the National 
Assembly held a plenary meeting at the conference hall under the 
direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan to 
continue debating the draft law on domestic investment promotion. 
  "The National Assembly heard Do Quoc Sam, minister and chief 
of the State Planning Commission, speaking on behalf of the Law 
Drafting Committee, present a report on ideas and viewpoints of 
National Assembly deputies on the draft law." 
  Many deputies suggested that only overseas Vietnamese who 
still hold Vietnamese citizenship are entitled to enjoying 
privileges specified by the law. Other deputies proposed that 
the government issue concrete regulations to prevent foreigners 
from making their investments under the name of local Vietnamese. 
  All deputies expressed their unanimous views on granting 
privileges and encouragement to investment projects in areas 
with numerous difficulties, in mountain regions, and offshore 
islands. They suggested that income tax exemption should be 
granted to these projects for two to four years, and business 
turnover tax for two years. 
  Many deputies expressed their concern over the granting of 
loans to promote domestic investment projects. They questioned 
whether the loans should be granted at the beginning of projects 
or later when they begin to bear fruit. 
  "Some deputies suggested that if the National Assembly 
passes 
the law on domestic investment promotion this year, the 
government should promptly issue regulations for its 
implementation." 
  Several deputies also suggested that for key investment 
projects proposed by overseas Vietnamese or by long-time foreign 
residents in Vietnam, the government should submit them to the 
National Assembly Standing Committee for consideration.

  [Text] A new ordinance issued by the National Assembly 
will lighten tax on those in the upper income bracket. The 
higher level of minimum taxable income should also provide 
relief. According to the new ordinance signed by the National 
Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh on 19 May and taking effect on 3 
June, a Vietnamese national is liable to pay tax on his income 
when it exceeds 1.2 million dong monthly. 
  The percentage of tax will then rise to 10 percent increment 
to a maximum of 60 percent. This represents a more liberal 
figure as compared to the decree of 1st April 1991, when tax 
started at 650,000 Vietnamese dong, and a top end bracket of 80 
percent. The liberalization also applies to foreigners who will 
be taxed 10 percent on monthly income of over 5 million dong as 
opposed to the previous 3 million.

  The National Assembly heard Do Quoc Sam, minister and chief 
of the State Planning Commission, on behalf of the law drafting 
committee, report on issues concerning the draft law as raised

  Fifteen of the 38 deputies registered to address the meeting

  [Text] The Mekong Delta, known as the "rice bowl" of 
Vietnam, may no longer be able to lay claim to that title if 
proposed hydropower plans affect the fertility of the region. 
  "Damming the Mekong River is like declaring a war with 
Vietnam," noted U.S. biologist Dr Tyson Roberts, who has 
observed the Mekong ecological system since the 1970s. 
  If Roberts is correct, then the first battle has already 
begun. Recently completed is the l,500-megawatt Manwan Dam, the 
first of its kind on the mainstream Lanchang Giang (Mekong 
River) in China's southem province of Yunnan. 
  The 4,200 kilometre Mekong River starts its journey from the 
Tibetan Himalayas passing through southwestern China, Burma, 
Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and then to Vietnam, where silt carried 
down the river and deposited in the area for thousands of years 
has formed a large expanse of over four million hectares of land 
at the delta. 
  River dwellers living in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia have 
noticed the unusually low water levels during the dry season 
since the dam was built. Vietnam, as the last country the 
Mekong passes before entering the sea, is no exception. 
  "We don't have any concrete or clear scientific conclusions 
about the unnatural reduction of water in the Mekong. But 
farmers at the delta have already noticed that water levels in 
the river and connecting canals are lower than they were in 
former years," said Dr Le Quang Minh, dean of the Water Resource 
and Land Improvement Faculty, Cantho University. 
  Cantho is the capital of Hau Giang Province, named after the 
largest "tail" of the "dragon". In Vietnam the Mekong River is 
known as the Nine-tailed Dragon, as the river formerly split 
into nine branches at the delta. 
  Two of the major branches are the Tien Giang and Hau Giang 
where webs of thousands of canals have been dug for navigation 
and irrigation. Giang comes from a Chinese letter meaning 
river. Today the "dragon" has only seven tails as two of them, 
Ba Ly and Co Chien, have been filled up with silt deposits. 
  Crop cultivation and sustainable ways of life in this part 
of 
the country are made possible by these tails. Over 50 per cent 
of rice harvested for local consumption and export are grown in 
the delta region. Shortly after economic liberalization in 
1986, Vietnam became the world's third largest rice exporter 
after the United States and Thailand. 
  "Engineers have quite a positive perspective about dams, but 
I do not. Even though people desire the proposed function of 
the dam, I wonder whether it will be operated as it was 
designed. The people who designed it are not the same ones as 
those who operate it," said Minh. 
  There are fears that the dam will be operated solely for the 
purpose of supplying energy without thought given to the effect 
dam operations will have on the delta region. 
  "If I were the director, and those dams were designed for 
generating electricity, I would keep this function as my 
priority when operating the dam. In the dry season, I would 
retain water to secure operation of the dam." 
  "It's the same story with the flood," the water management 
specialist continued. "If there is a big flood, I don't believe 
dam operators would retain the water because it could be risky 
for the safety of the dam." 
  Due to Vietnam's push for development and wealth, supported 
by multilateral business and financial agencies, the Vietnamese 
government strictly maintains its export-oriented policy. 
Agricultural products, especially rice, are produced for export. 
High-yield-varieties have been promoted in the delta area. 
Irrigation systems, as a result, need to be expanded and 
improved upon to catch up to the expansion of plantation areas. 
  The An Giang and Kien Giang provinces, west of the delta, as 
well as Dong Thap province in the East, are in the target areas 
of such agricultural development. However, the soil in O.55 
million hectares of the area is strongly acidic, 1.05 million 
hectares is medium and lightly acidic, 0.15 million hectares is 
permanently saline and 0.16 million has high salinity in the dry 
season. 
  The relationship between the soil, water and farming systems 
in the Mekong delta is so complicated and fragile that any 
changes in the condition of one component needs to be repeatedly 
tried and tested before the actual results of the change can be 
determined. 
  The Mekong Committee in 1992 hired the Netherlands 
Development Consultancy to plan irrigation improvement of the 
acidic areas in the Southwest of the delta. The consultant at 
that time planned to divert the water from the Hau Giang River 
to lower the acidity levels. 
  But the plan has not been implemented as detailed studies 
are 
needed to find out how much water should be wed. Too much water 
for irrigation means not enuough water at the mouth of the Hua 
Giang to maintain the natural conditions of salinity from the 
South China Sea. 
  While hydro engineers dream to tame the Mekong by 
controlling 
natural floods and drought, what never seems to be taken into 
account is the ecological implications when the natural flow is 
disrupted by huge concrete structures such as dams.

  [Text] Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating has pledged 
support for UN sanctions against North Korea. Linda Mottram 
reports: 
  Shortly after arriving in London at the beginning of his 
10-day visit to England and France, Mr. Keating released a 
statement on the North Korea tension. He has reiterated 
Australia's support for any action by the UN Security Council on 
the issue. He says it may still not be too late for 
negotiations, but Mr. Keating says increasingly it looks as if 
the UN Security Council will have to consider further action to 
indicate the depth of international concern.

  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating has encouraged his 
British counterpart, John Major, to use Australia as a trade and 
investment springboard into Asia. Mr. Keating has also raised 
Australia's ongoing trade concerns with Canada in a separate 
meeting with the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chretien. Linda 
Mottram reports that Mr. Keating met the British and Canadian 
leaders in London where they are gathering for the commemoration 
of the World War II D-day landing of Normandy 50 years ago. 
  [Begin Mottram recording] Ahead of the D-day ceremony, Mr. 
Keating met with Mr. Major in London with trade and investment 
are key agenda items in what the two leaders have described as a 
strong relationship. Officials say Mr. Keating assured Mr. 
Major that Australia's push for closer economic links with Asia 
did not exclude the Australia-Britain relationship. The 
Australian Government is keen for Britain to use its very high 
level of investment in Australia as a window into Asia. The two 
leaders also discussed the forthcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] leaders' summit in Jakarta and ways of 
advancing the Asia Pacific Economic Grouping. 
  Mr. Keating talked with Canada's Jean Chretien who described 
by officials as equally warm although Mr. Keating noted the 
bilateral relationship had languished somewhat in particular 
over trade tension. Officials described Mr. Keating as putting 
a strong argument for Canada to particularly review its decision 
to impose tariff quotas on the imports of Australian boneless 
beef. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia says it has been incorporating human 
rights issues into its direct and indirect defense contact with 
Indonesia. The approach is outlined in an Australian Government 
response to a parliamentary report on relations with Indonesia. 
  The document said Australia's Defense Force did not provide 
training to Indonesian troops for internal security or 
counter-insurgency. 
  The statement said cooperation with Indonesian Special 
Forces 
focussed on low-level military and welfare skills, as well as 
communications operation, small arms practice, and medical 
training. 
  Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the government shared the 
parliamentary committee's view that human rights was the most 
sensitive area of Australia's relations with Indonesia.

  [Text] China's biggest trade and investment delegation to 
ever visit Australia is continuing to generate multimillion 
dollar deals for local companies. About 500 business people, 
including 119 Chinese representatives, are today meeting at an 
investment forum in Sydney. Last week's first session of the 
forum in Melbourne resulted in 147 letters of intent worth a 
potential $1.2 billion [Australian]. Managing Director of the 
Australian Trade Commission Ralph Evans says the Chinese 
delegation has an extensive shopping list. 
  [Begin Evans recording] There were up to $10 billion worth 
of projects and that $1.2 billion on which there have been 
companies that have signed initial letters of intent represents 
12 percent of that. So, they have come with a very extensive 
shopping list and we would hope that more of it can be tapped 
into during the session here in Sydney today. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia's parliament has set out a proposed 
timetable for a cease-fire and a peace settlement to resolve the 
five-and-a-half-year conflict on Bougainville. The report of 
the Australian parliamentary delegation, which visited 
Bougainville in April, was welcomed by the Australian 
Government. The report calls for a cease-fire negotiated by 
Bougainville interim authority, local chiefs, the police and 
defense forces, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA], and 
the extra-legal resistant forces. 
  The peace timetable calls for several weeks of consultations 
and community meetings, agreement on a neutral chairman and 
agenda, and parallel talks with the Papua New Guinea Government 
and the BRA. Pacific island neighbors could provide natural 
observers and they should be a guarantee of safety for all 
participants. The report said Australia should offer to host 
and support talks either in Bougainville or in the north 
Queensland city of Cairns. The Australian parliamentarians 
strongly recommended that the Papua New Guinea Government 
authority should allow relief supplies to be delivered to the 
whole of Bougainville.

<F P=106> [By Jack Taylor] </F>
  [Text] Sydney, June 8 (AFP) -- Canberra was under mounting 
pressure Wednesday to answer charges its counter-intelligence 
service was in "a state of crisis" amid claims it had been 
forced to sack three more agents for alleged spying. 
  An opposition MP said the three, all Russian-language 
experts, had been dismissed by the Australian Security 
Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) on suspicion of having 
compromised national security. 
  Liberal backbencher Ken Aldred, responsible for a series of 
disclosures about Russian espionage activities here, claims ASIO 
decided not to charge the three with espionage fearing the 
embarrassment of another spy controversy. 
  ASIO, closely modelled on Britain's MI5 domestic 
intelligence 
agency, has been wracked in recent months by revelations it was 
penetrated and compromised by foreign intelligence agencies. 
  The Australian intelligence operations are now the subject 
of 
two major inquiries after a series of embarrassing episodes in 
the last year, including the arrest of ASIO officer George Sadil 
and the expulsion of six Russian diplomats for alleged spying. 
  Sadil been committed to stand trial on 24 espionage charges. 
  ASIO's telecommunications and computer networks are said to 
have been replaced because they had been bugged by foreign 
intelligence and were no longer reliable. 
  Aldred has also asked Canberra to explain why former Soviet 
spy Valeriy Zemskov was allowed to enter Australia after it was 
informed he had been exposed to British intelligence by Soviet 
defector Oleg Gordievsky as a member of the elite KGB "special 
reserve." 
  "Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade push so 
hard for his entry and who were members of the influence network 
he built of senior Australian public servants?" Aldred asked in 
a parliamentary question Tuesday night. 
  "What is the government hiding?" 
  Aldred told AFP Wednesday that about 30 senior Australian 
public servants, ministerial staff and others were currently 
under investigation by one inquiry, because of associations with 
Zemskov and for other matters. 
  The latest three Canberra-based agents to be accused were 
former colleagues of Sadil and all had been co-operating with 
him, Aldred said. 
  It is believed concerns about their conduct were raised by a 
long-running undercover investigation by the Australian Federal 
Police codenamed Operation Liver. 
  In his question Aldred claimed Australia's intelligence 
community was "in a state of crisis". 
  He asked if the three had been forcibly retired by ASIO and 
if it was true the government wanted them to go quietly rather 
than take action against them. 
  He told AFP Wednesday three separate sources had confirmed 
his information which suggested the three, who translated highly 
sensitive material including intercepts, had been a serious 
threat to national security. 
  "The government apparently preferred that they just go 
quietly rather than have the embarrassment of charging further 
people, which would have made the whole system look like it was 
falling apart, which it probably is," he said. 
  A spokesman for attorney general Michael Lavarch, who has 
responsibility for intelligence matters, said he had no 
information about the claims and in any case it was unlikely he 
would be able to either confirm or deny the story.

  [Text] There are further signs that Australia's economy is 
continuing to improve. National accounts figures just released 
show annual economic growth now stands at 5 percent -- up from 4 
percent previously. Belinda Trump reports that the figures are 
likely to increase fear the economy cannot keep up the pace. 
  [Begin Trump recording] Gross Domestic Products rose by 1.9 
percent in the March quarter -- double some market expectations. 
The main contributions to growth were strong household and 
government spending, while business investment remained weak. 
  The March quarter was the eleventh consecutive quarter of 
growth, but where the economy goes from here is a major issue. 
Financial markets see the fast growth as a pointer to rising 
inflation down the track and fear the government may have to 
bring forward an increase in interest rates to control economic 
growth. 
  For the moment, though, the government has the best of both 
world -- fast growth with further signs in today's figures that 
inflation during the March quarter remained low. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says the big 
jump in economic growth confirms the Australian economy is on 
track for a sustained recovery. Mr. Willis says the strong 
growth marginally reflects the influence of a number of one-off 
factors, such as a big increase in public spending. 
  Treasurer says however, the complementary jump in private 
consumption, combined with rising profits, provides a highly 
favorable environment for increases in business investment. 
  The prime minister, Paul Keating says it is 30 years since 
the country has the economic conditions as good as this.

  [Text] The creation of new jobs in Australia's small 
business sector is expected to continue underpinning the 
nation's employment recovery. Adrian Thirsk reports that a 
survey by Yellow Pages Small Business shows as many as half of 
all new jobs in the past six months have been in enterprises 
with fewer than 20 workers. 
  [Begin recording] [Thirsk] The survey of 1,000 small 
businesses -- Australia's biggest such study -- indicates job 
creation among small businesses surged in the three months to 
April -- up 2.1 percent after just a 1 percent rise in the 
previous period. 
  Economic adviser for the index, Dr. John Marsdon, said 
business plans for the three months to July suggests a leveling 
off, but at a healthy peak. 
  [Marsdon] The expected employment growth has eased back from 
the previous quarter, but again is still strong and we have seen 
that strength on all indicators, including on profitability.

  [Text] The United States Embassy in Fiji has come under 
fire for refusing to issue visas for 70 soccer fans who have 
already paid travel packages to attend the world cup in Los 
Angeles later this month. The Fiji Football Association, while 
expressing disgust at the Embassy's refusal, said it would take 
the matter up with the world soccer body, FIFA. The President 
of the Fiji Football Association (?Chadendra Majaraj) said the 
rejection was a bad reflection on the United States, which had 
sought Fiji's support to host the world cup. A spokesman for 
the American Embassy, Dennis (?Rowndes) said normal visitor 
rules were applied when applications were screened. He said some 
visas were approved while those which were not failed to show 
strong intentions of returning to Fiji once the world cup was 
over.

  [Text] The Fiji Parliament has passed the bill aimed at 
preventing possible terrorist attacks in Fiji aviation industry. 
The bill led by the tourism and aviation minister, Harold 
Powell, provides for life imprisonment as a maximum sentence for 
people convicted of hijacking, sabotaging, or endangering an 
aircraft. 
  Mr. Powell said the bill was important because it is in line 
with international aviation agreements and protocol. The laws 
would allow Fiji to be prepared to deal with crimes conducted in 
each aviation circuit and deter would-be fugitives wanted for 
aviation crime from taking refuge in Fiji. Mr. Powell said, 
under the new law, Fiji would have the legal grounds to force 
airlines using Fiji's airports to have a strict security system. 
Opposition leader Jairam Reddy said the bill was long overdue 
and he had no hesitation in supporting it.

<F P=106> [By Michele Cooper] </F>
  [Text] Rangoon, June 7 (AFP) -- Burma alleges that Western 
nations are deliberately distorting its drug production figures 
as part of their drive to put pressure on the government for 
political change. 
  Burmese officials said that the West, and particularly the 
United States, intentionally inflated the annual drug yield in 
Burma while refusing to recognize Rangoon's efforts at 
combatting the problem. 
  In a veiled reference to pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu 
Kyi, now in her fifth year of house arrest, Colonel Kyaw Win, 
deputy director of defense services intelligence, said: "As far 
as this factor exists, we will be over-assessed." 
  "Whatever we do, the West will downplay us," he said. 
  He and other officials interviewed over the past week never 
mentioned the country's leading dissident by name, but instead 
referred to Aung San Suu Kyi most frequently as "the factor," or 
occasionally as "the lady." 
  In conversations with AFP, officials also complained that 
warlord Khun Sa, who has been battling Rangoon government troops 
for autonomy in the Shan state, was being portrayed by some as a 
freedom fighter. 
  "He is a drug runner, and we take him as that," Kyaw Win 
said, adding there would be no peace talks with Khun Sa. 
  Officials pointed to crop substitution programs begun in 
border areas where Rangoon has signed peace agreements with a 
majority of the armed rebel groups who formerly fought the 
central government. 
  US Drug Enforcement Administration agents were given access 
to these areas for assessment, Kyaw Win said, but there was a 
high disparity" between their field reports and the figures 
eventually published in Washington. 
  US officials had no immediate comment. Western drug agency 
sources dismissed the charge, but one Western diplomat remarked 
that the allegation was "not impossible." 
  Western nations have assessed Burma's annual production of 
illicit opium, mainly in border areas forming part of the Golden 
Triangle, at around 2,500 tonnes -- a figure which Rangoon 
officials said was exaggerated. 
  Rangoon has, meanwhile, denied reports of major battles with 
Khun Sa's Maung Tai Army (MTA) in the Shan state, describing the 
fighting as only localized operations. 
  Asked about Khun Sa's claims of heavy losses by government 
troops, Kyaw Win acknowledged there were casualties, but "not as 
much as Khun Sa says." 
  A Rangoon-based diplomat concurred, saying casualties were 
running three-to-one, with Khun Sa's attacking forces suffering 
more than government troops operating from defensive positions. 
  Once the remaining Karen, Mon and Karenni rebel groups had 
signed peace agreements with Rangoon, Kyaw Win said, "we will go 
all out against Khun Sa." 
  He and other officials declined to say when such agreements 
might be concluded, but indicated that contacts were continuing. 
  Diplomats and other observers said they saw little prospect, 
however, for an early agreement with the Karen, who are believed 
to have the strongest rebel fighting force still in action 
against the government.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 3 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Cambodia has 
given an assurance that it will take appropriate action to 
ensure the safety of the Malaysian Embassy in Phnom Penh. 
  Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the assurance 
was 
given by Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut 
when they met in Cairo last Wednesday. 
  They are attending the 11th meeting of the Nonaligned 
Movement (NAM) in the Egyptian capital. 
  He told BERNAMA when contacted by telephone from here Friday 
that Prince Sirivut expressed regret over the bombing incident 
at the embassy and said that the incident would not recur. 
  On May 19, a hand grenade was thrown into the embassy 
compound by unidentified persons. 
  No casualties were reported in the incident, the first act 
of 
violence against the embassy since the United Nations-supervised 
general election there last May. 
  Abdullah thanked Sirivut, who is also Cambodia's foreign 
minister, and the police for the swift action taken following 
the bombing, the motive of which was unknown. 
  Cambodian authorities also gave security protection to the 
embassy staff. 
  Abdullah said foreign ministers of ASEAN countries attending 
the meeting held an informal meeting to discuss preparations for 
the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting and Post Ministerial 
Conference (PMC) in Bangkok next month. 
  The informal meeting was attended by all foreign ministers 
of 
ASEAN except Ali Alatas of Indonesia who was indisposed.

  [Text] On 6 June, the government decided on a package of 
measures to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons. Under the package of measures, 
1) Japan will strongly urge North Korea to cooperate fully with 
nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to clear up suspicions about its development of nuclear 
weapons; 2) Japan will study steps it must take in response to 
economic sanctions if the UN Security Council votes to impose 
them, while watching how the UN Security Council handles the 
DPRK nuclear issue; 3) If the UN Security Council decides to 
take appropriate measures including economic sanctions to force 
North Korea to change its behavior, Japan would support the 
measures and take the maximum steps possible within the 
framework of the Constitution; and 4) As a member of the 
international community, Japan will make maximum diplomatic 
efforts to urge China to exert influence on the DPRK while 
maintaining international cooperation. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will visit South Korea on 11 
June to affirm with his South Korean counterpart that both Japan 
and South Korea will work together cooperatively to settle the 
DPRK nuclear issue. His visit to China on 12 June is being 
coordinated by the two countries, and he intends to seek the 
Chinese Government's understanding for the four-point measures 
if his visit to that country is realized.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sandwiched Between United States and </F>
China, Japan Is Agonizing"] 
  [Text] Japan, sandwiched between the United States, which 
is poised to begin a full-fledged study of ways to impose 
sanctions against North Korea for its suspected development of 
nuclear weapons, and China, which is cautious about any 
sanctions against North Korea, is agonizing over how it should 
conduct its diplomacy. 
  The Foreign Ministry's view is that if the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] continues to hold discussions on imposing 
sanctions against North Korea, leaving the current deadlock over 
the issue unbroken, the UNSC would inevitably vote to adopt a 
resolution warning North Korea, the substance of which is 
harsher than that of two presidential statements, or to impose 
the first mild economic sanctions against North Korea. According 
to a high-ranking government official, the government plans to 
place priority on what the United States advocates if the United 
States and China split in their opinions on sanctions against 
North Korea, but the government intends to vigorously persuade 
China, which is negative about imposing sanctions against North 
Korea. The government believes that if China is isolated from 
the rest of the world because of the North Korean nuclear issue, 
it would lead to instability in the Asia-Pacific region. The 
government is concerned that Japan would have limited policy 
options if a situation were created wherein China vetoes a 
resolution slapping sanctions on North Korea and the United 
States responds to China's action by taking the lead in imposing 
multinational-type sanctions against North Korea outside the 
United Nations. The Hata government wants to promote a strategy 
under which Japan makes aggressive international contributions 
mainly through the United Nations. It seeks permanent 
membership in the UNSC, and it vigorously participates in the UN 
Peacekeeping Operations (PKO). For the Hata government, it is 
most desirable for all permanent members of the UNSC, including 
China, to take concerted actions to settle the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Unlike the Gulf war in which the United States took 
initiatives in the UNSC and led multinational forces in fighting 
against Iraq, the Clinton administration has continued to 
cautiously deal with the North Korean nuclear issue while 
watching the progress of negotiations between the IAEA and North 
Korea. The United Kingdom and France have taken a tough stand 
on the North Korean nuclear issue. It appears that their tough 
stand has not become a consensus in the UNSC because of the 
cautious U.S. stand. 
  A growing number of officials in the government think of the 
need to reaffirm Japan's cooperation with the United States, 
saying: "We must think of forging a Japan-U.S. alliance in light 
of the North Korean nuclear issue" (according to a top 
government official). Japan, however, cannot make light of 
relations with China which have a great impact on Japan's 
security. Prime Minister Hata is likely to be pressed to make a 
difficult diplomatic response to the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 7 (ANTARA) -- The ministerial meeting 
of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] in Cairo has suggested 
Indonesia, as NAM chairman, to hold a dialogue with the group of 
seven industrialized countries (G7) when they meet in Napoli, 
Italy, chief executive of the NAM chairman Nana Sutresno has 
said. 
  "The G7 summit will soon be held in Napoli, and the Cairo 
ministerial meeting has asked NAM to continue making an approach 
to the forum by having the chairman of G77 [developing 
countries] and the chairman of the Cairo ministerial meeting to 
take part," Nana Sutresna said upon arrival at the Sukarno-Hatta 
Airport in Jakarta Monday after attending the NAM ministerial 
meeting in the Egyptian capital. 
  This means, he added, NAM has taken concrete steps in facing 
further developments on the basis of the breakthrough made by 
President Suharto in the course of his meeting with the G7 
recently. 
  "This is obviously a commitment of whoever is to succeed 
Indonesia to meet the seven industrialized countries," he said. 
  President Suharto's meeting with the G7 member countries in 
Tokyo last year was considered a performance of high strategic 
significance in Indonesia's leadership of the 111-member 
Nonaligned Movement. 
  "The meeting has already been followed up by making the 
Tokyo 
resolutions a decision of the United Nations General Assembly. 
This is of strategic significance because it was the first time 
that the NAM's initiative has been supported by the entire 
international community, including the industrialized nations," 
Nana said. 
  One of the follow-up measures of the historical Tokyo 
meeting, he added, was the formation by the New York-based NAM 
coordinating bureau of a working group asking for the views of 
experts of the Geneva-based South Centre to see what has to be 
done by NAM in the implementation of the resolutions.

  [Text] Yesterday in Vientiane, a meeting took place 
between the Lao National Committee for Control and Suppression 
of Narcotic Drugs [LNCCSND] and a high-level delegation of the 
U.S. Government. The Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] 
was represented at the meeting by Souban Salitthilat, deputy 
foreign affairs minister and chairman of the LNCCSND, while the 
U.S. side was led by Richard Lee Brown, director of the U.S. 
National Drug Control Policy Office attached to the U.S. 
presidential office. 
  At the meeting, the two sides reviewed achievements made by 
the Lao and U.S. Governments in implementing a project designed 
under the memorandum of understanding on cooperation in narcotic 
drugs issues signed by the two countries on 30 September 1989. 
The spirit of the memorandum has so far been translated into a 
comprehensive rural development project launched in Meuang Son 
District, Sam Neua Province, aimed at reducing production and 
trafficking in narcotic drugs. Since 1990, the Lao side's task 
force has seized 905 kilos of opium, 155 metric tons of 
marijuana, and over 34 kilos of heroin. Also, the Lao side 
officially set up an office for the Committee for Control and 
Suppression of Narcotic Drugs on 20 May 1994. 
  The U.S. delegation arrived in Laos for at noon on 7 June.

  [Text] The Thai army yesterday publicly outlined a 10-point 
policy to back up its claim that it no longer supports the 
Maoist guerrilla group. 
  The army's do's and don'ts policy on Cambodia includes 
absolutely no contact at any level with the Khmer Rouge and 
absolutely no support to them, according to Lt Gen Chettha 
Thanacharo, the commander of the First Army Region. 
  He said it also strictly prohibits supplying of arms to all 
sides in Cambodia. 
  Lt Gen Chettha, who oversees security along Thai-Cambodian 
border, briefed reporters on the policy in response to a fresh 
charge from the U.S. State Department concerning Thailand's 
relations with the Khmer Rouge. 
  He said under the policy arms seized from the Khmer Rouge 
would not be returned to the rebel group. Arms belonging to the 
Cambodian army would be returned via the Thai Foreign Ministry, 
he said. 
  The regional army chief said Army Commander in Chief Gen 
Wimon Wongwanit had ordered that the policy be strictly observed 
in order to refute any accusations that Thailand still supports 
the Khmer Rouge or any other side in Cambodia. 
  Lt Gen Chettha spelled out the policy after the U.S. State 
Department questioned Thailand about reports that it was still 
backing the Khmer Rouge. The charge was repeated in an article 
in THE WASHINGTON POST written by former U.S. ambassador to 
Thailand Morton Abramowitz who said that Thailand's stubborn 
support for the Maoist group had helped prolong the war in 
Cambodia. 
  Lt Gen Chetha said Cen Wimon had issued firm instructions to 
all his subordinates demanding full adherence to the policy. "It 
is being adhered to one hundred per cent," Chettha said. 
  The policy has been circulated to government agencies 
concerned, he said. It was formulated in February after the 
accusation by Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut that Thai 
Army tanks had been spotted in the Khmer Rouge zone. 
  "We have a clear policy. We have come to the end of our 
efforts. There is nothing else to be afraid of. But doing more 
is impossible," Gen Chettha said. 
  The accusations began in mid-February after the Khmer Rouge 
recaptured Anlung Veng which had been briefly taken over by 
Phnom Penh troops. The accusations escalated into a war of words 
between Bangkok and Phnom Penh after the Khmer Rouge retook 
Pailin from Cambodian government troops in March. 
  The army's policy toward Cambodia as outlined by Lt Gen 
Chettha yesterday: 
-- Non-interference in Cambodia's internal affairs; 
  -- Absolutely no support for the Khmer Rouge; 
  -- Ban of arms supply to Cambodia; 
  -- Absolutely no contact with the Khmer Rouge but liaison 
with the Cambodian government is permitted; 
  -- Weapons seized from the Khmer Rouge are to be impounded; 
  -- Weapons belonging to the Cambodian government are to be 
returned through the Foreign Ministry; 
  -- The closing and opening of Thai-Cambodian border 
checkpoints is strictly under the control of the Interior 
Ministry; 
  -- The army will provide support for border security only 
on the instructions of the Interior Ministry; 
  -- All military units must strictly observe the 
above-mentioned policy; and 
  -- The policy must to be seriously enforced to counter any 
further accusations against Thailand. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday that 
all the accusations heaped against Thailand were part of an 
attempt to divert attention from the real cause of problems in 
Cambodia. 
  Surin said he had clarified Thailand's position during his 
meeting with the new French ambassador.

  The representative of the Vietnam MIA Office handed over the 
above-said remains and wreckage to the representative of the US 
Joint Task Force Full Accounting. This was the third handover 
in 1994. Since March 1974, Vietnam has on 48 occasions returned 
the remains of 619 American servicemen to the US side. 
  The US side highly appreciated the humanitarian policy and 
cooperation of the Vietnamese Government and people.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says 
the federal government will emphasize training in any package of 
military assistance given to Cambodia. 
  Australia is still deciding whether to provide the war 
ravaged Asian nation with arms. Senator Evans said Australia 
was still discussing Cambodia's request for military assistance 
with other potential donors -- the United States, France, 
Malaysia, and Indonesia. 
  He said there was a general view among the donors that 
Cambodia's primary need was for a training of an effective 
military force. The foreign minister said a competent 
noncorrupt government in Cambodia would be able to deal with the 
Khmer Rouge insurgency.

  [Text] Paris, June 7 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Tuesday [7 June] welcomed the latest accord to restart 
bilateral trade talks in financial services and intellectual 
property rights. 
  Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for 
external affairs, and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
confirmed the significance of the agreement during their 
20-minute meeting here, Japanese officials said. 
  Matsunaga, former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., and 
Kantor 
are in Paris to attend a two-day ministerial conference of 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
that opened Tuesday. 
  Financial services and intellectual property rights have 
been 
added recently to the three priority industrial sectors for the 
trade "framework" negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. 
  The original priority areas in the framework talks are 
government procurement, insurance, and trade in autos and auto 
parts. 
  Working-level talks on financial services began in Paris 
earlier in the day between Japan's Finance Ministry and the U.S. 
Treasury Department. This followed the resumption of insurance 
trade talks in Tokyo last week after a hiatus of three and a 
half months. 
  Financial services talks focus on ways to expand access by 
U.S. investment advisers to Japan's pension market, deregulation 
of securities business in Japan and steps to facilitate 
international deals on financial services. 
  On intellectual property rights, Japan and the U.S. will 
study how to protect patents involved in "reverse engineering" 
for computer software.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The "mood is good" in resumed 
"framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States on 
medical equipment, a Japanese official said Tuesday [7 June]. 
  But the Foreign Ministry official told reporters after the 
first session of a two-day working-level meeting that the two 
sides agreed not to comment on details, noting he would probably 
be able to offer better information Wednesday. 
  He added that time was limited on the first day, with 
discussion starting in the afternoon and most of the session 
devoted to questions and answers by the two sides confirming the 
progress made before the talks stalled in February. 
  Government procurement of medical and telecommunications 
equipment is one of three priority areas, along with automobiles 
and auto parts, and insurance business. 
  Medical equipment is the last item in working-level talks on 
the priority areas that got restarted last Wednesday with 
discussions on the insurance business. Telecommunications 
sector talks were held separately last Friday and Saturday. 
  Asked whether the talks on government procurement are near 
agreement compared with other areas, the official said, "we feel 
relaxed" because substantial progress had been made by February. 
But he refused to describe the talks as a "front-runner," 
stressing that anything could happen "midway." 
  Japan and the U.S. agreed to resume working-level talks 
again 
on already-ended topics after making further progress but 
failing to narrow the gap on the crucial issue of "objective 
criteria." 
  On the medical equipment issue, the Japanese official said 
the two sides are arranging to meet again in mid-June. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor reportedly indicated 
in Paris that the U.S. is not seeking agreements in all three 
sectors before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven leading 
industrialized nations in July. 
  However, the Japanese official also suggested the 
possibility 
of such sectoral agreements, saying that no deadline was set 
when Japan and the U.S. agreed two weeks ago to restart the 
bilateral trade talks. 
  But he noted, "We are not aiming for that."

  [Text] Naha, June 7 KYODO -- Okinawa Gov. [governor] 
Masahide ta will urge the U.S. Government and military to reduce 
its bases in Okinawa during a 13-day trip to the United States 
starting Thursday [9 June], prefectural officials said Tuesday. 
  Ota, who has visited the U.S. twice over the issue, is 
scheduled to meet commanding officers of the Hawaii-based U.S. 
Pacific Fleet. 
  In Washington he will have talks with representatives for 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary 
William Perry as well as with members of the Senate and House 
Armed Services Committees. 
  Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are 
located in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. Ota hopes 
to convince Washington that a partial withdrawal from Okinawa, 
which would make more land available for nonmilitary purposes, 
will help the prefecture's economic development. 
  On Ota's wish list are the return of the U.S. naval port in 
Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and 
live-ammunition exercises. 
  The governor also plans to meet former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger, who served as the late U.S. President Richard 
Nixon's adviser during the negotiations for the return of 
U.S.-held Okinawa to Japan. 
  Okinawa was reunited with Japan after a 27-year occupation 
on 
May 15, 1972, under the condition that U.S. forces would be 
allowed to continue to use Okinawan bases. 
  Ota plans to ask Kissinger for more details about a secret 
document guaranteeing the reentry of U.S. nuclear weapons and 
transit rights in Okinawa in case of emergency. The pact was 
signed in 1969 by then Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and 
Nixon as revealed in a recently published book, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The United States has called 
on Japan to stop bank remittances and cash gifts from Korean 
residents of Japan to North Korea because of Pyongyang's 
suspected nuclear development program, a top Japanese diplomat 
said Wednesday [8 Jun]. 
  Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's 
Foreign Policy Bureau, quoted U.S. Government officials as 
saying that there are strong demands in Congress and mass media 
for Japan to halt cash remittances. 
  Yanai made the statement at the day's session of the House 
of 
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. He represented Japan 
at weekend trilateral talks in Washington with Robert Gallucci, 
U.S. assistant secretary of state, and Kim Sam-hoon, South 
Korean special envoy for the nuclear issue. 
  The Cabinet Information Research Office reportedly estimated 
the aggregate annual amount of cash flow between Japan and North 
Korea, including two-way trade and investment, at 180 to 200 
billion yen. 
  Yanai also quoted Gallucci as saying the U.S. will urge 
China 
to stop exports of oil to North Korea, which reportedly depends 
on China for 60 percent of its oil imports and 75 percent of its 
food imports. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials told a team of the no. 
1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on 
Wednesday that Japan has expressed its willingness to comply 
with the U.S. call to stop cash remittances to North Korea, LDP 
officials said. 
  Yanai and other diplomats told the team headed by LDP Policy 
Affairs Research Council Chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto that it is 
possible to regulate cash gifts to relatives from Korean 
residents of Japan traveling to North Korea by sea and air, the 
officials said. 
  Japan need only take "legal measures" to put a ceiling on 
the 
sum of money Korean travelers are legally allowed to take out of 
Japan to North Korea, Yanai was quoted as saying. 
  A ministry official said, "some rationale is needed to hold 
down the maximum sum of money a traveler would be allowed to 
take to a specific country." 
  Ministry officials also said it is legally possible to ban 
the entry of North Korean diplomats to Japan as part of a 
package of sanctions. 
  However, they said the maximum curb Japan could impose on 
limiting the travel and reentry of Korean residents of Japan 
between Japan and North Korea is a nonbinding "recommendation 
for them not to travel to North Korea." 
  "It is impossible to ban the travel of ordinary citizens in 
view of international laws and the U.N. Convention on Human 
Rights," a ministry official was quoted as saying. 
  The official also told the LDP team that he believes the 
U.S. 
would not be able to slap multilateral sanctions with Japan and 
South Korea "without awaiting the issuance of a UN Security 
Council resolution." 
  In a related development, a government source expressed 
distrust in North Korea's handling of its people. 
  "North Korea spends most of its national income on military 
expenditure," he said, and added that the country's common sense 
is beyond comprehension for Japanese people. 
  "A dictatorship tends to create tension among foreign 
countries and tries to impose order domestically while keeping 
its people hungry," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan will urge China to 
persuade North Korea to accept international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Wednesday. 
  Hata made the remarks at the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee, answering questions about Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa's scheduled visit this weekend to China and South Korea. 
  "China has great influence over North Korea. It is making 
various kinds of dialogue efforts and I hope it continues them," 
Hata said. 
  Kakizawa's visit was arranged for emergency consultations on 
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program and potential 
punitive measures against Pyongyang, according to government 
sources. 
  Cabinet Legislation Bureau chief Takao Ode said at the same 
session that if Japan resorts to force following a possible U.N. 
Security Council resolution on sanctions, the action would 
violate the war-renouncing Constitution. 
  At a separate session of the lower house Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Kakizawa reiterated Japan's stance that it does not 
immediately urge economic sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  The foreign minister said he hopes the United States keeps 
Japan's reluctance in mind at a Security Council meeting now in 
session. 
  Kakizawa denied a possibility that Japan, South Korea and 
the 
U.S. will impose sanctions outside the framework of the Security 
Council if China, Pyongyang's last remaining ally, vetoes them. 
  The U.S. has called on other Council members to join in a 
proposal to slap sanctions on North Korea for downloading some 
8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods from a nuclear reactor, a move 
that the U.S. warns could lead to the production of several 
nuclear bombs.

  [Excerpt] The issue of North Korea's suspected development 
of nuclear weapons was addressed in the House of 
Representatives' Budget Committee session today. Speaking at 
the committee session, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reiterated 
his hope that China will use its power of influence over North 
Korea to resolve the problem. 
  [Begin Hata recording] China is a country with very close 
friendly relations with North Korea, and their economic ties are 
very strong too. That being the case, China holds a lot of 
influence over that country. In addition, China is a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council. And while we would like to 
learn more about China's views, we would certainly like it to 
use its power of influence. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Hata added that although Japan wanted a 
solution through dialogue, government offices were, of course, 
exchanging information among themselves about contingencies that 
might arise. He said the government would take appropriate 
action to fulfill its role in the international community. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also spoke at the session. He 
is due to visit South Korea and China on 11 and 12 June 
respectively. He said that in Seoul he wanted an exchange of 
views so that South Korea and Japan could cooperate in taking 
efficient action. 
  In China, he said, he wanted to ask that Beijing make 
efforts 
to persuade North Korea to accept inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The pro-Pyongyang General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on Monday 
[6 June] protested police raids earlier in the day on an 
educational foundation and 26 other locations affiliated with 
the organization in Kyoto. 
  The Chongnyon's Central Committee issued a statement 
demanding that Japanese authorities immediately halt their 
alleged "political suppression" of Korean residents of Japan. 
  Police raided Kyoto Chosen Gakuen, an educational foundation 
running schools for Korean students, on suspicion of illegally 
buying land without notifying Kyoto Municipal authorities of the 
intended use of the property. 
  Among other locations searched by investigators was the 
Kyoto 
Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon. 
  In April, police searched the Osaka headquarters of 
Chongnyon, on suspicion of disturbing a citizens' meeting that 
was held to urge North Korea to release political prisoners. 
  North Korea's official media has since published almost 
daily 
condemnations of the "hostile acts" of Japanese authorities, 
charging that the police action has been timed to coincide with 
the aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Kyoto, June 7 KYODO -- Kyoto city officials 
apologized Tuesday [7 June] for the oversight that led to a 
police raid Monday on the Kyoto chapter of a pro-Pyongyang group 
of Korean residents and its school, Kyoto Chosen Gakuen. 
  Haruyuki Nishi, head of financial affairs for the Kyoto 
municipal government, apologized for the city's oversight in 
thinking that the school had failed to submit a report required 
under the National Land Utilization Law. 
  Kyoto police raided 27 locations associated with the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), including 
the school, believing the school had failed to submit a report 
on the intended uses of the land. 
  The 43,000 square meters of land was purchased from Kyoto 
farmers between March 1990 and October 1991 for the relocation 
of the school building. 
  The land is located in an urbanization control area and the 
law requires that necessary information must be filed with the 
municipal government upon transaction of such land. 
  On Tuesday, Nishi said police had inquired in late March 
about the land transaction and an official in the city's land 
uses inspection section overlooked the proper entry in the 
city's ledger. 
  Nishi also explained that since 1987 the city has been 
computerizing its operations under the law, but the school's 
transaction had not yet been put in the computer. 
  As the computerization operations continue, city officials 
will double-check the data to avoid a recurrence of the 
incident, he added. 
  Earlier Tuesday, Chongnyon members in Kyoto protested the 
raid and demanded an apology and the return of confiscated 
articles. 
  Meanwhile in Tokyo, the head of Chongnyon's international 
division, Kim Tae-hui, demanded an apology and tighter control 
over "unjust raids and violations of human rights by police 
authorities." 
  Police raided Chongnyon's Osaka offices in April on 
suspicion 
that the association's members disrupted a rally by another 
group of Korean residents demanding North Korea release 
political prisoners. 
  Monday's mistaken raid also comes amid a growing number of 
attacks on students of Chongnyon-affiliated schools, believed to 
have been sparked by allegations that Chongnyon members send 
billions of yen annually to relatives in North Korea. 
  The U.S. Government believes that at least some of the money 
is funneled to the financially strapped North Korean Government 
and may be used to fund a suspected nuclear arms development 
program.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The Justice Ministry has 
started an investigation into discriminatory actions against 
Korean residents in Japan that have reportedly increased with 
the recent focus on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development, ministry officials said Wednesday [8 Jun]. 
  The actions include verbal abuse and physical harassment 
such 
as knifing of clothes against students of Korean schools. 
Female students of schools run by the pro-Pyongyang General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) wear 
traditional Korean clothing for uniforms, which could make them 
a target. 
  At a meeting Tuesday night of the House of Representatives 
Justice Committee, Yasuo Kakehi, head of the ministry's Civil 
Liberties Bureau, said the ministry thinks such acts violate 
human rights and is investigating them. 
  Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai told the meeting that Korean 
residents in Japan should have the same human rights as Japanese 
nationals.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- The majority of Japanese 
surveyed are aware and supportive of Japan's bid to become a 
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, according to a 
government survey released Saturday [4 June]. 
  The survey conducted by the Foreign Ministry showed 58.9 
percent of respondents knew that Japan's permanent membership is 
being discussed in connection with the reorganization of the 
Security Council. 
  The poll also found that 52.9 percent think Japan should 
hold 
a permanent seat on the council, while 14.8 percent think 
otherwise. 
  The survey, conducted between late January and February on a 
sample of 2,000 people aged 20 years or older, is the first of 
its kind conducted by the ministry. Of those polled, 1,420 
replied, ministry officials said. 
  The officials expressed relief over the results of the 
survey, saying that public interest has been high ever since the 
government began stepping up debate on the issue last July. 
  Among those supporting Japan's permanent membership, 41.2 
percent said that as an economic superpower Japan should 
actively participate in building world peace, according to the 
survey. 
  Another 27.5 percent replied that permanent membership by 
Japan, a nonnuclear state which professes pacifism, would 
contribute to world peace, while 25 percent said it is strange 
that Japan cannot contribute its opinions on important 
decision-making in the U.N. when it is making great financial 
contributions. 
  Also among the supporters, 41.2 percent said Japan should 
make contributions as much as possible, including participation 
in U.N. peacekeeping activities, within the limits of its 
war-renouncing Constitution. 
  But 38.8 percent said that although Japan should make the 
utmost in contributions within constitutional limits, it should 
not make any military contributions, including joining 
peacekeeping activities. 
  Of those opposed to Japan's permanent membership, 60.7 
percent replied that Japan should not take part in making 
decisions on international peacekeeping which involves military 
might, while 36.9 percent expressed concern over the greater 
responsibilities of becoming a permanent member, according to 
the poll. 
  Also, 20.2 percent said Japan is not great enough as a 
nation 
to become a permanent member.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
instructed his aides Tuesday to consider having the Hiroshima 
atomic bomb dome placed on a UN list of world heritage sites. 
  Hata told an informal cabinet meeting he supports 
registration of the building and directed Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and other officials to look into the 
matter, officials said. 
  "Nuclear weapons are a tragic thing and Japan ought to be 
telling the people of the world that it is the only country to 
have suffered an atomic bombing," Hata told reporters after the 
meeting. 
  The move followed a proposal at the meeting by Koshiro 
Ishida, director general of the Management and Coordination 
Agency, that the dome should become a heritage site to mark next 
year's 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. 
  Ishida told a news conference the listing of the dome 
deserves consideration because the Nazi-built World War II 
Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland is also on the UN list. 
Poland placed it on the list in 1979. 
  Several million people, many of them Jews, were killed in 
the 
concentration camps. 
  Supporters of the bid to have the dome registered have 
argued 
that it is comparable in significance to the Auschwitz camp 
since it is a symbol of the suffering caused by the war and a 
reminder of the dangers of nuclear warfare. 
  "Japan is the only country to have suffered an atomic 
bombing 
and has an obligation to signal peace to the world," Ishida said. 
  Japan joined the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) convention concerning the protection of 
the world cultural and natural heritage in June 1992, 20 years 
after its creation. 
  The dome, a symbol of the nuclear attack on the city in the 
closing days of World War II, is part of the former Hiroshima 
Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall designed by Czechoslovak 
architect Jan Letzel. 
  The ferroconcrete building was some 160 meters below the 
point at which the atomic bomb exploded on Aug. 6, 1945. 
  The World Heritage Program, begun in 1978, aims to protect 
sites and landmarks of outstanding universal significance. 
  The UNESCO list of more than 360 sites throughout the world 
includes the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Taj Mahal in 
India, Chartres Cathedral in France, and Serengeti National Park 
in Tanzania. 
  The four sites Japan has listed include Yakushima, an island 
dotted with Japanese cedars off the southernmost main island of 
Kyushu, the Shirakami mountain region with its beech trees 
straddling Aomori and Akita Prefectures in northern Japan, the 
seventh-century Horyuji temple in Nara Prefecture and the 17th 
century Himeji Castle in Hyogo Prefecture, both western Japan. 
  The Hiroshima city assembly and Rengo Hiroshima, an 
organization comprising a number of local groups, have backed a 
campaign to persuade Diet members to register the dome. 
  But to qualify for placing by the government on the UNESCO 
list, sites in Japan must be designated under the Cultural 
Properties Law. 
  The Agency for Cultural Affairs, which administers the law, 
normally only registers sites from before the postfeudal Meiji 
era, which began in 1868. 
  Any decision to register the dome would have to be made in 
time for a UNESCO-sponsored international meeting in December at 
which site nominations are assessed.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said Wednesday [8 Jun] he thinks the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was 
not making specific demands on Japan in its statement released 
the previous day. 
  The OECD, which on Tuesday began a two-day ministerial 
conference in Paris, suggested in the statement that countries 
whose economies are not recovering from recession should adopt 
further financial easing and fiscal measures. 
  "There certainly are such phrases (urging the measures) here 
and there. However, I don't think the wording means that they 
want Japan to specifically make additional efforts in its 
policies," Kumagai said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori reiterated Peru's wish to join the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Foreign Ministry officials 
said Monday [6 June]. 
  Fujimori voiced the bid in a dinner meeting with Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, the officials said. 
  Hata told Fujimori that APEC agreed last November to freeze 
new membership to the forum for three years. 
  Although Japan has urged other APEC member nations to allow 
Peru's participation in the forum's working group meetings, no 
consensus was achieved, Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Fujimori is in Japan on a four-day unofficial visit that 
began Sunday. He is to leave for China Wednesday for an 
official state trip. 
  The visit is Fujimori's fifth to Japan, including one before 
he became president. 
  Also during the two-hour dinner meeting, Hata called for 
Peru's cooperation so Japan could provide yen loans to Peru. 
  The loans are to cover three projects to rehabilitate water 
and sewage facilities in Lima, improve harbor facilities in 
Peru's main seaport of Callo Bay, and to complete irrigation 
facilities, the officials said. 
  Hata also told Fujimori Japan plans to send a mission to 
Peru 
as soon as possible to study Tokyo's future economic and 
technical cooperation, they said. 
  Japan suspended sending experts to Peru after the July 1991 
murder of three aid workers but partially resumed technical 
cooperation to Peru this January. 
  Hata also gave high marks to Fujimori's tackling of 
terrorism 
and economic reforms, the officials said. 
  Fujimori told Hata he has achieved most of his initial goals 
to tackle terrorism, economic and administrative reforms, and 
accumulated debt.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- Japan will hold the first 
working-level defense meeting with Germany on Monday and Tuesday 
in Bonn as part of its program for promoting security dialogue 
with other nations, government officials said Saturday [4 June]. 
  At the meeting, the Defense Agency's senior staffs, headed 
by 
Defense Councilor Ken Sato, will discuss with their German 
counterparts various security issues, including U.N.-sponsored 
peacekeeping operations, the officials said. 
  The joint talks were first proposed by German Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe last November to then Defense Minister 
Keisuke Nakanishi while he was visiting Tokyo. 
  The agency plans to hold bilateral meetings regularly 
thereafter because the two nations share common interest in 
acquiring permanent U.N. Security Council membership, defense 
sources said. 
  The Japanese defense officials are also scheduled to stop 
over in France to exchange views with the country's defense 
officers before heading for Germany, the government officials 
said. 
  Japan's Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, enacted in May 1992, 
restricts overseas operation of Self-Defense Forces troops to 
noncombat duties, as shown in the peacekeeping operation in 
Cambodia from 1992 to 1993. 
  Germany's Constitution also prohibits troops from 
participating in U.N. combat missions outside the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) territory. 
  But in attempting to occupy permanent Security Council 
seats, 
the two nations are likely to be more pressured to expand their 
role in U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
  World War II victors Britain, China, France, Russia and the 
United States are the only permanent members at present.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan will delete a phrase in 
an official statement that it does not regard the use of nuclear 
weapons as a violation of international law, Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Kakizawa, taking back an earlier position, said the 
government will revise the statement to "the use of nuclear arms 
is not consistent with the spirit of humanitarianism existing at 
the basis of international law because of its power of 
destruction, killing and wounding." 
  Kakizawa made the comment at a session of the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee. 
  The ruling coalition on Monday endorsed the previous 
phrasing 
which was complied by the Foreign Ministry and was scheduled to 
be submitted to the International Court of Justice. 
  The government had maintained there were treaties banning 
the 
use of gas and chemical weapons but no treaty in existence 
banning the use of nuclear arms. 
  However, after the government's view was publicized on 
Monday, opposition parties and some cabinet ministers criticized 
the statement. 
  Management and Coordination Agency chief Koshiro Ishida said 
Tuesday, "It is regrettable to say the use of nuclear weapons 
does not violate international law." Environment Agency chief 
Toshiko Hamayotsu said the use of nuclear arms violates spirit 
of international law. Both Ishida and Hamayotsu belong to the 
Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  A-bomb victims in Nagasaki and Hiroshima also raised 
objection to the government's standing on the issue. 
  At Wednesday's session of the committee, legislators from 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party 
and Japanese Communist Party criticized the statement saying it 
is not proper for Japan, the sole country to have experienced 
the wrath of atomic bombs, to recognize the use of nuclear arms. 
  Japan maintains three antinuclear principles -- not to make, 
possess or harbor nuclear weapons on its territory. 
  The Hague-based international court called on nations 
concerned to submit a document on the issue after the World 
Health Organization (WHO) asked it in May to decide whether or 
not staging nuclear warfare violates international law.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- A private defense advisory 
panel to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will likely present a new 
concept for defense buildup, replacing the current concept of 
the Cold War period, panel sources said Sunday [5 June]. 
  The nine-member panel, established by Hata's predecessor 
Morihiro Hosokawa earlier this year, is scheduled to offer 
recommendations to Hata by summer for a revision of the national 
defense program outline, which has served as Japan's basic 
defense policy since 1976. 
  A panel member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said 
that the current concept should be changed following the end of 
the Cold War era because the concept still assumes large-scale 
disputes between the United States and the former Soviet Union. 
  The group so far has discussed post-Cold War developments 
around the world and the military situation surrounding Japan. 
  The panel is going to present an assessment of international 
situations that the world has changed from the U.S.-Soviet 
confrontation to a new international order where complex threats 
spread. 
  The sources said that the planned new concept will pledge to 
maintain defense capability improvements based on the U.S.-Japan 
security pact. 
  They said the new concept will not aim at specific threats 
to 
Japan. The new concept will also urge readiness for regional 
conflicts, terrorist attacks and cooperation for U.N. 
peacekeeping operation, the sources said. 
  Observers said a new concept will demand a thorough review 
of 
the current level of Self-Defense Forces strength and formation. 
  Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies, 
including Japan's future role in U.N.-led peacekeeping 
operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the 
Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- A Chinese environmental 
delegation began meetings Monday [6 Jun] to seek funding from 
Japanese aid agencies and businesses for a 4 billion dollar 
sustainable development plan for China. 
  China's Agenda 21, developed with the UN Development Program 
(UNDP), contains 64 priority projects and over 500 total 
projects for sustainable and environmentally sound development 
in the next century, said Shi Han, a delegation member. 
  The delegation, led by Shi Jianmin, vice minister of China's 
State Planning Commission, arrived in Japan on Sunday. 
  It is scheduled to meet with several governmental and 
business organizations including the Foreign Ministry, the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. 
  China hopes to use part of the Agenda 21 funds to help make 
its industry more energy-efficient. It also wants to launch a 
clean-coal technology exchange with Japan, Shi said.

  [Text] Sapporo, June 4 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian 
maritime industries have agreed to jointly operate about 20 
ferry services between Hokkaido and Sakhalin, Russia, for six 
months beginning in May 1995, Transport Ministry officials said 
Saturday [4 June]. 
  The officials said the agreement was made in a shipping 
meeting in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in Russia. 
  The ferry service will link Korsakov in Sakhalin with the 
cities of Wakkanai and Otaru in Hokkaido, the northernmost part 
of Japan. 
  Under the agreement, reached by Japan's six shipping 
companies and a Sakhalin company, a 5,025-ton vessel owned by 
the Russian company will be used for the regular ferry service. 
  The shipping industries of the two nations have had talks 
since 1991, based on the Japan-Russia Maritime Agreement.

  [Text] Okayama, June 4 KYODO -- Officials from a small 
Japanese town will leave Tuesday [7 June] on a 10-day visit to 
former Yugoslavia in search of ways to provide assistance to the 
war-torn country. 
  The Kamogawa Town office in Okayama Prefecture, western 
Japan, enacted a unique local regulation in April calling on its 
people to conduct their own rescue operations in countries 
stricken by disasters and war. 
  This will be the first overseas dispatch of its officials 
under the regulation. It is very unusual for Japanese local 
governments to have such a rule, town officials said. 
  The two officials, Noboru Nishida, 45, and Kiyoshi Okada, 
41, 
will fly first from Tokyo to Geneva where they will visit such 
U.N. bodies as the World Health Organization (WHO). 
  After entering the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the two will 
have a first-hand look at situations there and study how 
Japanese nongovernmental organizations and U.N. bodies are 
helping local people. 
  After their return, the town plans to draw up a concrete 
program for its own international assistance that will be 
applied to other countries in the future, the town officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan will extend emergency 
aid of 4 million dollars to the World Food Program (WFP) to help 
people in Sudan facing serious starvation from civil war and 
drought, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday [7 June]. 
  The money will be used to cover the WFP's shortage of funds 
to transport food to the southern region of Sudan, where some 
2.2 million people are said to be confronted with imminent 
starvation, according to the ministry. 
  The region's agricultural production has greatly 
deteriorated 
as a result of changeable weather, insects and the country's 
civil war which broke out in 1983. 
  The main mode of transportation for food is by air because 
the region lacks law and order and has poor infrastructure such 
as roads. But a shortage of funds has forced the suspension of 
two of the three possible air routes. 
  According to a survey conducted by the WFP, the death rate 
per day in southern Sudan stands at 11.2 people per 1,000, a 
"major catastrophe" by the standards of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the ministry said. 
  Japan suspended extending official development assistance to 
Sudan in October 1992 due to the African nation's violation of 
human rights.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Wednesday [8 Jun] rejected a call from the primary opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for an extra 1.9 trillion yen to 
be added to the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  "The government-proposed budget program is insufficient as a 
means of boosting the nation's economy," LDP President Yohei 
Kono said at a news conference after meeting with the premier in 
the Diet building. 
  Citing the shortage of time for Diet deliberations, Hata 
refused to comply with the LDP's request for the extra money, 
Kono said. 
  "The government should take more active economy-spurring 
steps," the LDP chief said, adding, "I am a little concerned as 
to whether (Hata) really understands the importance of 
pump-priming measures." 
  The LDP, toppled from government last summer for the first 
time in 38 years, will submit to the Diet a motion calling for 
the additional 1.9 trillion yen in the government's 73.1 
trillion yen draft budget for the current fiscal year, which 
started on April 1. 
  The long-overdue budget is scheduled to clear the decisive 
House of Representatives on Wednesday evening. 
  The LDP's modification plan will demand additional spending 
on public works projects, subsidies to private schools and 
financial assistance to small and medium-sized companies, among 
other things, LDP officials said. 
  It will also call for 800 billion yen in additional outlays 
for public works and 900 billion yen to support small 
enterprises, the officials said. 
  Under the proposal, the extra money should be financed 
through dipping into reserves, the issuance of public bonds and 
by cutting administrative costs, they said. 
  Kono has repeatedly warned the LDP will file a no-confidence 
motion against the Hata cabinet once the budget wins Diet 
approval.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The House of Representatives 
on Wednesday [8 June] approved a 73.08 trillion yen budget for 
fiscal 1994, 70 days overdue and three months after it was 
tabled in the Diet. 
  The passage of the bill at the lower house plenary session 
followed approval of the fiscal budget for the year that started 
in April by the Budget Committee of the lower house. 
  The ruling coalition, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and 
new party Sakigake [Harbinger] voted for the bill, which was 
immediately sent to the House of Councillors. 
  Since the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest 
opposition bloc, plans no filibuster in the upper house, the 
budget is expected to become law in late June. 
  Diet debate on the budget, which was submitted to parliament 
on March 4, has been delayed due to a political squabble over 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's dubious financial 
deals in the past. Hosokawa stepped down in April amid the 
turmoil. 
  The budget bill remained shelved for 80 days in the lower 
house Budget Committee before it was approved after 13 days of 
discussion. 
  The nation's full spending plan includes 5.47 trillion yen 
in 
cuts in income and residential taxes to stimulate the economy. 
  Despite tight fiscal conditions, expenditures for public 
works projects were also increased by a brisk 4.0 percent. 
  Public works spending accounts for nearly 9 trillion yen of 
the 40.85 trillion yen general operating expenditures, the core 
part of the budget including most outlays other than debt 
serving costs and tax allocations to local governments. 
  Defense spending, in contrast, was raised by a scant 0.9 
percent to 4.68 trillion yen. 
  Government operations in the current fiscal year has been 
financed by an 11.05 trillion yen stopgap budget that became law 
on April 1. 
  The temporary budget will be incorporated into the full 
budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japanese direct investment 
overseas rose for the first time in four years in fiscal 1993 
ended in March, climbing 5.5 percent to 36,025 million dollars, 
the Finance Ministry said Friday [3 June]. 
  Such investment was encouraged by the appreciation of the 
yen 
against foreign currencies, higher costs of manpower in Japan 
and the growth potential of other countries, a ministry official 
said. 
  The figure was the fifth largest annual total on record. 
Direct overseas investment hit a record in fiscal 1989 but has 
since been declining, totaling 34,138 million dollars in fiscal 
1992. 
  Japanese manufacturers invested strongly in the Asian 
region, 
with investment rising 17.9 percent to 3,659 million dollars. 
  Machinery makers stepped up investment in Asia by 103.8 
percent to 434 million dollars, while food manufacturers raised 
theirs by 95.8 percent to 139 million dollars. 
  Other manufacturing sectors also boosted investment, with 
63.7 percent growth reported by the electric machinery industry 
and a 55.6 percent increase by the transportation industry. 
  China and Hong Kong were the most popular regions for direct 
investment, with growth of 58.0 percent in total investment in 
China and a 68.4 percent increase in Hong Kong. 
  In contrast, direct investment in North America by Japanese 
manufacturers fell by 0.7 percent while Europe saw a 2.9 percent 
decline. 
  Investment by Japanese nonmanufacturers, however, grew by 
20.4 percent in Europe and by 6.3 percent in North America. 
  Although large investments were seen by electric appliance 
companies in North America, and by chemical firms in Europe, the 
ministry official said that "large-scale investment in these 
areas has basically peaked out." 
  Foreign direct investment in Japan fell 24.6 percent to 
3,078 
million dollars. 
  Investment in the manufacturing sector dropped 2.8 percent, 
while falling a sharp 38.8 percent in the nonmanufacturing 
sector. 
  In the nonmanufacturing sector, investment in service 
businesses declined by 74.8 percent, and by 77.2 percent in the 
financial and insurance industries. 
  Japan's economic slump and high investment costs discouraged 
foreign investors, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- A panel of advisers urged 
the government Monday [6 Jun] to halve the gap between domestic 
and overseas prices of some Japanese products over the next five 
years by promoting deregulation. 
  To accomplish the proposal, a working group of Prime 
Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's task force on administrative reform will draw up 
a specific timetable this month for reducing price differences, 
according to a report submitted by the panel to cabinet 
ministers. 
  "It is a problem that Japan's basic prices are 36 to 50 
percent higher than in the United States and European 
countries," Hata told a meeting of the working group discussing 
measures to promote imports and to improve market access and 
distribution. 
  "Reducing the gap in prices will not lead to deflation," he 
said. "Deregulation will help create domestic employment and 
allow foreign companies to enter the Japanese market." 
  After the meeting, Hata told reporters that he thought such 
a 
gap could be reduced by about 20 percent. 
  In a related development, business leaders chairing three 
government-commissioned economic advisory groups met separately 
to discuss problems associated with administrative reform. 
  But they failed to endorse a proposal by one of them, Tax 
Commission Chairman Kan Kato, to set targets for reducing price 
gaps, commission sources said. 
  The other participants were Gaishi Hiraiwa, who heads the 
Economic Council, and Eiji Suzuki, chairman of the Fiscal System 
Council. 
  Kato made the proposal to Hata recently along with other 
reform measures, including a review of the method for fixing 
public service charges. 
  The task force panel report, written by private-sector 
specialists of the working group, urged deregulation of the 
licensing system for retailers of liquor products, tobacco and 
rice by allowing other able and highly-motivated retailers to 
sell such products. 
  It proposed imposing mandatory upper-limit pricing for 
public 
services and other charges such as railway fares, and gas and 
electric fees. 
  The paper asked for authorization to establish self-service 
gas stations, while making it easier for trucking companies to 
get permission to increase the number of districts to which they 
are allowed to deliver cargo and parcels. 
  It urged the lifting of a ban on setting up holding 
companies, and called for a review of regulations on the amount 
of shares that can be owned in certain firms. 
  The report asked the government to phase out the current 
restrictions on establishing large-scale retailers and 
liberalizing imports and marketing of gasoline and other oil 
imports. 
  It also called for the abolition of exceptions to the 
formation of price and other competition-limiting cartels within 
five years. 
  U.S. trade negotiators have blasted the price gaps as the 
result of Japanese export industries' policy of subsidizing 
export prices by transferring the cost to Japanese consumers in 
the form of higher domestic prices.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan should give wider 
foreign access to its technologies and a new 
"technology-oriented society" with a freer outflow of 
technology, a government panel report said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  According to the report by an advisory body to the minister 
of international trade and industry, the leader in the world of 
technology should boost access to its technological innovation 
for foreigners. 
  The report, released by a subcommittee of the Industrial 
Technology Council, also called for promoting international 
collaboration in developing new industrial technologies, while 
playing a key role in solving environmental problems and AIDS. 
  Unlike the conventional concept of a techno-society focused 
on technological development at home, the proposed new 
technology-based society would be primarily characterized by 
free inflows and outflows of industrial technologies. 
  Currently, Japan's technological exchange is overwhelmingly 
lop-sided, with the number of Japanese researchers studying in 
the United States five to six times higher than that of foreign 
researchers here. 
  Access to Japanese technologies for foreigners is one of the 
key themes of the stalled "framework" trade talks with the U.S. 
  The proposal comes with the emergence of the need to pursue 
global collaboration in technological areas due to slumping 
investments in research and development and a declining number 
of local engineers. 
  The same needs have emerged elsewhere, as the end of the 
Cold 
War has made technology a tool for economic growth, rather than 
for military expansion. 
  In addition, the ballooning costs and risks involved in 
technological development make global alliances meaningful. 
  In country-to-country technological transfers, Japan should 
pay more attention to assisting recipient nations, mostly 
developing countries, to upgrade their technological levels. 
  More globally, the country should take the initiative in 
fighting such global challenges as environmental protection with 
its advanced technological know-how, the report said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Representatives of four 
small-business organizations, in a petition delivered to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata Tuesday [7 Jun], expressed opposition to a 
further relaxation of the large-scale retail stores law as part 
of economic deregulation. 
  A group of small-business executives, led by Kosaku Inaba, 
chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called 
on Hata at the prime minister's official residence to deliver 
the petition concerning economic deregulation and tax reform. 
  The petition also said the proposed hike in the general 
consumption tax from the present 3 percent should be delayed 
until after national economic recovery. 
  It was signed by Inaba and top executives of three national 
small-business organizations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The Postal Ministry will 
consider removing the telecommunications market barrier between 
KDD [Kokusai Denshin Denwa -- International Telephone Company] 
and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) as part of 
economic deregulation, ministry officials said Tuesday [7 June]. 
  KDD controls Japan's international telecommunications market 
while NTT handles domestic telecommunications. 
  The NTT and KDD laws clearly define their business 
territories. 
  The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will consider 
removing the barrier when it conducts a complete review of NTT 
operations in fiscal 1995, the officials said. The review is 
expected to cover a possible split-up of NTT. 
  KDD was set up in 1978 as a result of the separation and 
privatization of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corp.'s 
international division. NTT was born in 1985 when the 
corporation itself was privatized. 
  If a division of NTT were allowed to enter the international 
telecommunications market, the effect on the structure of 
Japan's telecommunications market would be serious, the 
officials said. 
  An advisory group for Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata earlier 
called for removal of the barrier between the international and 
domestic markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry has 
revised qualification standards for general contractors taking 
part in biddings for public works projects in order to provide 
wider access to foreign firms, ministry officials said Tuesday 
[7 June]. 
  The step was taken as the ministry prepares to introduce an 
open bidding system for large-scale projects in the current 
fiscal year that started April 1, the officials said. 
  They said safety records and measures to promote the welfare 
of workers will be added to the existing 17-point screening 
process to calculate the quality of bidding firms. 
  At present, the value of works completed in the past was 
given heavy weight in evaluating contractors. 
  Under the new method, small-scale firms with high 
technological standards and management foundations will receive 
high marks, the officials said. 
  As for foreign bidders, the number of engineers they employ 
and the length of their service in their home countries will be 
taken into account, they said. 
  The qualifications of general contractors are reviewed every 
other year in order to select reliable contractors. 
  The new evaluation method will be introduced in the next 
fiscal year that begins April 1, 1995, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
government came under pressure at a forum Monday [6 June] to 
carry out administrative and fiscal reforms ahead of a 
consumption tax hike. 
  The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata held a tax 
reform forum Monday to hear views from representatives of 
business and consumer groups. 
  The representatives asked the government to continue income 
tax cuts in fiscal 1995 and beyond. 
  They were divided on a possible increase in consumption tax 
from the present 3 percent, but joined hands in calling on the 
government to carry out administrative and fiscal reforms over 
resistance from bureaucrats. 
  Business representatives told the session an increase in 
consumption tax will be unavoidable to generate funds to make up 
for revenue shortfalls resulting from income tax cuts and to 
cope with the aging society. 
  Masae Wada, representative of the Japan Housewives 
Association, expressed opposition to a consumption tax increase, 
calling for a correction in the unfair tax system. 
  A labor representative called for a revision of consumption 
tax to transfer part of the revenue to local governments.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
is set to propose full-fledged tax reform, featuring a tacit 
call for 6.2 trillion yen in permanent tax cuts and an 
offsetting sales tax hike from the current 3 percent to above 6 
percent. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a news 
conference that panel members "were convinced" of the need for 
tax reform in line with materials prepared at a meeting Friday 
[3 June] for regional hearings next week. 
  They included notes from discussions so far, social welfare 
measures prepared by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, fiscal 
2000 revenue estimates and problems of the current income and 
consumption tax systems by the Finance Ministry. 
  The materials call for tax reform that results in net tax 
revenue increases after cuts and adjustments, and Finance 
Ministry estimates that would satisfy this goal would require 
hiking the consumption tax to between 7 percent and 10 percent. 
  The ministry estimates are based on a three-year time lag 
between the 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts and the sales tax hike, 
and also on a 10-20 year maturity of stopgap bonds for financing 
the advance tax cuts. 
  As for cutting income and resident's taxes, the panel is 
expected to call for lessening tax burdens in the 7-10 million 
yen annual income bracket, according to the materials. 
  Uncertainty remains whether the advisory panel to the prime 
minister will include concrete figures in its report to be 
compiled soon after the regional hearings. 
  Indeed, forum sources said the panel is inclined to exclude 
figures to avoid unnecessary political disputes, especially for 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is sensitive about 
raising the consumption tax. 
  The SDP split off from the ruling coalition amid disputes 
over cabinet formation by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, thus 
leaving the coalition with a minority rule. 
  Kato has said the report will include various alternatives 
for the ruling parties to decide on tax reform led by permanent 
tax cuts by the end of June, as Japan promised in the March 
market-opening package. 
  But even if the panel leaves the report vague, its 
implications will be quite obvious since the ministry's revenue 
estimates are also submitted to the ruling parties. 
  Meanwhile, Kato indicated earlier that the panel may call 
for 
a phased consumption tax hike -- initially raising it only to 6 
percent. 
  Considering administrative and fiscal overhauls, the panel 
is 
expected to call for government leadership to win public support 
for the planned tax reform that will ask for heavier tax burdens. 
  The panel chairman said he trusts Hata, who indicated his 
"strong determination" to promote administrative reforms when 
Kato visited the prime minister on Wednesday. 
  On the regional consumption tax, the report is to call for 
further discussions, the sources said. 
  Kato said the consensus is that local governments should 
have 
their own tax revenue sources but the panel is still undecided 
on the method, with various "clerical and technical problems" 
seen in adopting a regional consumption tax. 
  But he suggested in his earlier press remarks that the panel 
may encourage the ruling parties to decide on a regional tax, 
saying, "there are some political ways (to go about it)."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The government's Tax 
Commission on Tuesday [7 Jun] opened a series of public hearings 
on proposed tax reforms in Osaka and five other cities 
nationwide. 
  Similar hearings will be held in Tokyo and four other cities 
Friday, commission officials said. 
  The hearings are expected to focus on income tax cuts and a 
raise in the general consumption tax from the present 3 percent. 
  Tuesday's hearings are being held in Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, 
Sendai, Fukuoka and Kumamoto. 
  A total of 44 persons, including company executives, 
housewives and welfare workers, have been selected to express 
their views at the hearings. 
  The commission will take into account views expressed at the 
hearings when working out tax reform recommendations to be 
announced later this month, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- A study group composed of 
representatives of the ruling coalition parties on Tuesday [7 
June] submitted a report to the umbrella committee on tax system 
reform calling for the boosting of indirect tax to realize a 
fair funding structure, group officials said. 
  The group, studying the pension, medical and other social 
welfare systems, said in the report that Japan should become a 
welfare- oriented society funded by the expansion of indirect 
tax. 
  The report said that, based on an impartial taxation system, 
the government should provide quality welfare, realizing 
long-term stable pensions, enhancing the efficiency of medical 
services and strengthening nursing care, they said. 
  It suggested that the government raise the consumption tax 
rate, currently at 3 percent, noting that taxpayers now bear too 
great an income tax burden and the rate of direct taxation is 
too high, creating unsteady tax revenues because of the close 
mirroring of economic fluctuations. 
  However, the report avoided referring to the margin by which 
the consumption tax rate should be raised. 
  The tax reform committee of the coalition parties will begin 
full-scale discussion of reform of the nation's tax system after 
Thursday when the results of two other study groups -- on 
administrative reform and the fundamentals of taxation -- are to 
be submitted.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Representatives attending 
public hearings held by the government's Tax Commission on 
Tuesday [7 June] were divided on a proposed consumption tax hike 
to cope with the rapid aging of the population. 
  The commission's chairman, Kan Kato, however, expressed 
optimism that public support would be obtained for the tax raise. 
  Representatives of business, consumer and other groups 
expressed their opinions on tax reforms at the hearings held in 
Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, Fukuoka and Kumamoto. 
  They generally called for income tax cuts on a continuous 
basis in and after fiscal 1995 but were split over a raise in 
the 3 percent consumption tax. 
  Even the proponents of the hike demanded administrative 
reforms and curbs on government expenditures as prerequisites 
for the raise. 
  They expressed hope that a hike would be held to the minimum 
level if it is unavoidable. 
  Kato, who attended a hearing in Osaka, told a news 
conference 
most representatives were "cooperative" on the proposed tax 
raise. 
  He said the commission would like to come up with a concrete 
plan, including the rate and timing of the tax hike, by the end 
of June. 
  The commission is planning similar hearings in Tokyo and 
four 
other cities Friday.

  [Text] Fukuoka, June 5 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of 
the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), renewed 
his party's determination Sunday [5 June] to submit a 
no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
minority government. 
  Kono hinted at a news conference in Fukuoka the LDP would 
take the step once the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget wins 
parliamentary approval. 
  He expressed cautious optimism that another major opposition 
party, the Social Democratic Party, would go along with the LDP 
on the motion. 
  Kono said it is up to Prime Minister Hata to challenge the 
no-confidence motion or elect to step down and call a snap 
election.

  [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese 
at 2332 GMT, in its "News 2001" program, carries a 15-minute 
live interview in Tokyo with Masaharu Gotoda, former deputy 
prime minister from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], by 
moderator Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University Professor Yoshiaki 
Kobayashi, and political commentator Kenichi Takemura. 
  At 2333 GMT, Kuroiwa asks Gotoda for his views on the Hata 
administration. 
  Gotoda says: "The Hata Cabinet lacks a power base as a 
cabinet under the system of parliamentary democracy. In the 
House of Representatives, for instance, little more than one 
third of the members belong to the ruling parties, and the 
figure drops to one quarter in the House of Councillors." 
  He adds that as the purpose of political reform is to 
introduce responsible political administration, the ruling 
coalition should hand over political power to the opposition LDP 
and take the blame for causing the recent political chaos. 
  Gotoda then says: "From the viewpoint of parliamentary 
democracy or the parliamentary cabinet system, the Hata Cabinet 
is an anomaly," adding that this alone is sufficient reason for 
the opposition parties to submit a motion of no-confidence 
against the present cabinet. 
  The topic of discussion moves on to the next general 
election, and Gotoda says that right now the next general 
election could not be held under the new electoral system 
because it is uncertain when the Diet will approve the electoral 
redistricting bill. 
  Gotoda says that although the present cabinet is incapable 
of 
handling the pending important issues, such as North Korea, tax 
reform, and the Naples summit, the possibility of it facing a 
no-confidence motion is uncertain because both the LDP and the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are divided over the 
matter. 
  He predicts, though, that even without a vote of 
no-confidence the cabinet may be forced to resign en masse, 
regardless of the SDPJ's standing demand that it quit. 
  Gotoda says he is in favor of completing the redistricting 
bill as soon as possible so that elections can be held under the 
new system. He admits, however, that the Hata cabinet may not 
survive until the bill is passed, and the election may have to 
be held under the existing system. 
  "If that happens, the political parties should first promise 
voters that efforts to accomplish electoral reform will not be 
aborted. Otherwise, the people will not be convinced," he says. 
  Kobayashi says political realignment, on the basis of policy 
on pending issues, is needed before the next general election. 
He then asks Gotoda if he would act as leader of a camp 
opposing forces led by Ichiro Ozawa. 
  Gotoda says: "It would be impossible to complete political 
realignment before the next general election. I think it will 
take several years." 
  He says political realignment will be completed by the 
process of forming successive new administrations over the 
course of several general elections. 
  He says: "There is also the possibility that when the no- 
confidence motion is submitted, the coalition may simply 
reshuffle its party make-up to provoke the LDP and the SDPJ 
rather than dissolving the lower house to conduct a general 
election." 
  He adds that it is most important that the LDP strengthens 
its unity to deal with such a situation. 
  Asked about the possibility of a conservative alliance 
between the ruling coalition parties and the LDP, Gotoda says: 
"Such an alliance may result in the revival of the 'Taisei 
Yokusankai' [an autocratic national political mobilization 
organization] seen before World War II." 
  Finally, at 2345 GMT, Gotoda says: "While both the LDP and 
the SDPJ have appeared to acknowledge the end of the '1955 
political regime' [post-1955 political order in which the LDP 
dominated over the SDPJ and other opposition parties], they 
still unconsciously cling to the way things appeared in 1955. 
  He calls on all parties to deal with pending issues, each 
from their own different standpoint.

indicated that as early as after the fiscal year 1994 budget 
bills have passed through the House of Representatives, ruling

  In his speech, Ozawa said: In the process of future 
political 
realignment, a new government must be one in which an agreement 
has been made in a calm and rational manner regarding not only 
personal relationships but also new policy issues so that it can 
respond to a new world order. 
  Making references to security matters, such as how to deal 
with the issue of DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons development 
and problems of administrative and financial reforms, Ozawa 
indicated that as early as after the fiscal year 1994 budget 
bills have passed through the lower house of the Diet, ruling 
and opposition parties will begin to move toward forming a new 
government to decide how the nation's basic policies ought to be.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), a party in the ruling coalition, on Wednesday [8 
June] named Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa as party head, 
succeeding Keigo Ouchi, who resigned over a political blunder 
that brought about the first minority government in four decades. 
  Yonezawa was selected on the second day of the party's 
convention without a vote since he was uncontested. 
  The No. 2 post of secretary general was assumed by Kansei 
Nakano, a veteran party member of the House of Representatives. 
  Ouchi, health and welfare minister in the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, stepped down from the party chairmanship 
under pressure from rank-and-file party members and supporters. 
  They have been disgruntled by his high-handed move to create 
a new parliamentary group, "Kaishin," without participation from 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), then the coalition's largest 
bloc. 
  The SDP consequently walked out of the grouping just after 
Hata was elected prime minister, depriving the coalition of 
majority support. 
  At the convention, Yonezawa acknowledged the party's growing 
distrust of its main coalition partners, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], as well as 
ire toward the SDP. 
  He made clear he wants to keep the DSP within the coalition 
to counter the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest 
opposition force, while suggesting alliance talks with SDP 
lawmakers. 
  "There are also people within the SDP who can be our 
friends," he said. 
  He took critics against Shinseito and Komeito to task, 
calling them "emotional."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The House of Representatives 
budget committee, overriding the ruling coalition's opposition, 
decided Tuesday [7 June] night that there should be a unanimous 
decision on Diet testimony by former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa for his questionable personal finances. 
  Parliamentary sources said the opposition camp, led by the 
Liberal Democratic Party, pushed for a Hosokawa testimony, 
encouraged by budget committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi. 
  Yamaguchi, a Social Democratic Party member, proposed that 
both the ruling coalition parties and opposition parties should 
decide unanimously on whether or not Hosokawa testifies before 
the Diet about his personal finances, an issue which drove him 
out of power in April. 
  Yamaguchi said the Hosokawa issue should be determined after 
testimony by Hosokawa's former secretary Masatoshi Miyama, who 
the opposition camp alleged has a good grasp of the former 
premier's monetary affairs.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- A former Fair Trade 
Commission (FTC) chairman Friday [3 June] denied the commission 
made a back-door deal with politicians in 1992 not to file a 
criminal complaint against a bid-rigging group in exchange for 
their help in revising the Antimonopoly Law. 
  Former FTC head Setsuo Umezawa told the House of Councillors 
Budget Committee that his contacts with then ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) members were necessary for consulting 
about the law. 
  But Umezawa, testifying as a witness, flatly denied any FTC 
deals with LDP members, saying, "it is absolutely untrue." 
  Criticized over the ineffectiveness of the law in stopping 
rampant bid-rigging by construction contractors, the FTC had 
considered raising penalties against firms breaking the 
Antimonopoly Law but met with strong opposition from some LDP 
members who had represented the profits of contractors. 
  In early 1992, the FTC made on-the-spot inspections of 
contractors allegedly involved in a bid-rigging case in Saitama 
Prefecture, north of Tokyo. 
  But by the time it was considered unavoidable for the FTC to 
file the complaint, the commission announced in May 1992 it 
would not file any accusation with prosecutors and only ordered 
the 66 companies involved to stop the antimonopoly practice. 
  Some LDP members are suspected of having pressured the FTC 
to 
drop the complaint on behalf of the group of 66 companies, 
including major contractor Kajima Corp. 
  The FTC is suspected of then having chosen not to file the 
complaint with prosecutors because it wanted the LDP members' 
cooperation in revising the Antimonopoly Law according to the 
way it had originally planned. 
  One of the LDP members, former Construction Minister Kishiro 
Nakamura, was arrested in March this year and later indicted on 
a charge of accepting a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima in 
January 1992 in exchange for helping to block the FTC's criminal 
allegation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- House of Representatives 
Speaker Takako Doi on Friday [3 June] proposed upgrading the 
lower house council on political ethics to a standing committee 
as part of a personal Diet reform plan. 
  Doi urged the lower house's Steering Committee Chairman 
Keiwa 
Okuda to draw up a concrete plan based on a personal plan that 
she has put together through study meetings she has held since 
she assumed the Diet post in August 1993. 
  It is very unusual for lower house speakers to refer to the 
steering committee their own ideas for reforming the Diet. 
  In her personal scheme, Doi advocates promoting the Ethics 
Council to become a new standing committee on "political ethics" 
by which the Diet can promptly deal with scandals involving 
politicians and clarify structural cause of corruption. 
  To effectively deal with scandals, the new committee should 
be entitled to summon people to a session to testify under oath, 
according to her plan. 
  In Doi's plan the press would be allowed to take pictures of 
witnesses testifying before the Diet. 
  At present, the Diet prohibits the press from taking any 
pictures while testimony is under way to protect the rights of 
witnesses. 
  Also, Doi recommends setting up a new Diet Information 
Center 
to provide easy public access to the minutes of both plenary and 
committee sessions. 
  In the future, Doi said, the Information Center should 
establish a data base that can provide people with past remarks 
by government officials in the Diet on various subjects.

    [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2230 GMT on 5 June 1994, in its "News 2001" program, 
carries a live 34-minute studio interview with Wataru Kubo, 
secretary general of the opposition Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ], by FNN announcer Yuji Kuroiwa, Keio University 
Professor Yoshiaki, and political commentator Kenichi Takemura 
in Tokyo. 
  At 2241 GMT, Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Kubo 
about the possibility of the SDPJ returning to the ruling 
coalition. 
  Kubo says: "I am always willing to meet Mr. Ozawa [secretary 
general of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party]) to discuss how to 
handle Japanese politics." 
  He is then asked by Kobayashi to comment on Ozawa. 
  Kubo says: "Mr. Ozawa has his own strategy and he pushes for 
his strategy in a high-handed manner," adding that he has often 
felt Ozawa has not listened to what others have said. 
  He also says: "The claim, though, that the Hosokawa 
government was under Mr. Ozawa's thumb, is incorrect." 
  Asked again about the possibility of the SDPJ returning to 
the ruling coalition, Kubo says: "Keeping a minority government 
in power is undesirable at a time when Japan is saddled with a 
lot of sticky domestic and foreign issues. The Hata government 
must be ousted from power." 
  He adds: "The ruling parties have called on the SDPJ to 
return to the ruling coalition, but it would be difficult for 
the SDPJ to join the Hata government. 
  "We want the Hata cabinet to resign en masse after the 
passage of the 1994 budget bill in the Diet. What we are saying 
is that the SDPJ is willing to discuss with other parties ways 
to form a new coalition government." 
  He is then asked by Kobayashi about the SDPJ's 
"uncompromising" conditions for joining the discussion on 
formation of a new coalition government. Kubo notes the 
three-point agreement reached among the coalition partners when 
they formed the Hosokawa government. 
  "The SDPJ cannot accept any change in the three-point 
agreement and will concede to other parties, if needed, on the 
basis of the three-point agreement." 
  [Editorial report] At this point an unidentified FNN 
correspondent reports from Seoul on South Korean reaction to 
North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Kuroiwa says the United States 
is highly likely to ask Japan to halt current remittances to 
DPRK by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan. He asks Kubo to 
comment. 
  Kubo says: "In reality, it is difficult to halt the 
remittances. It is difficult because they are made through third 
countries. I believe that there are various problems in trying 
to halt the remittances. I think there are things that need to 
be done before the United Nations imposes economic sanctions 
against North Korea. We should not put the emphasis on 
discussing how to impose the economic sanctionsKorean expert on 
North Korean affairs, discussing what the United States will ask 
Japan to do to support economic sanctions. 
  Kubo is asked to respond, and says: "I believe that given 
the U.S. strategy United ]? 
  Kubo says: "The SDPJ should first indicate to the people how 
it will deal with the situation when the Hata cabinet is voted 
out of power in the Diet." 
  Discussing the possibility of the SDPJ forging an alliance 
with the LDP, Kubo says: "The SDPJ will not forge any alliance 
with the LDP and the SDPJ will not return to the Hata 
government. We will seek to form a new coalition government." 
  Hinting at the big possibility of the Hata cabinet resigning 
en masse, Kubo says the SDPJ wants the Hata cabinet to seek the 
confidence of the people by dissolving the House of 
Representatives and holding general elections.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- A Labor Ministry panel 
proposed Monday [6 June] that Japan's traditional lifelong 
employment system be revised to meet the changing industrial 
structure and the fast growing aging population, officials said. 
  The officials said the proposal was made in a report worked 
out by the Labor Ministry's Employment Policy Research Group. 
  The officials said the report urged the government to map 
out 
a new employment policy that would include revising the 
seniority-based, lifetime employment system, long hailed as 
contributing to Japan's economic growth. 
  In view of the changing industrial structure and graying 
society, new labor problems are expected to arise that the 
traditional employment system will not be able to overcome, the 
report said. 
  To promote structural change through deregulation and 
maintain the labor supply-demand balance, it is necessary for 
the government to implement appropriate macroeconomic policies 
and investment expansion designed to achieve annual economic 
growth of about 3.0 percent, the report said. 
  While basically maintaining the long-term employment system, 
new steps must be taken by enterprises to develop human 
resources and secure part-time workers, the report said. 
  The officials said the report also stressed the need for the 
government to systematically foster workers engaged in public 
welfare-related fields to cope with the aging society. 
  It urged the government to consolidate the environment in 
which middle-aged and senior workers are allowed to work to the 
age of 65. 
  The report also called on the government to take positive 
steps to promote employment of female workers. 
  The officials said the report will be reflected in a new 
employment policy to be worked out by the ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- More than 80 percent of 
large and small Japanese firms have set a mandatory retirement 
age at 60, reflecting growing corporate willingness to retain 
employees for longer periods, according to a government survey 
released Sunday [5 June]. 
  The poll by the Management and Coordination Agency, however, 
also revealed many companies still resist government 
recommendations for post-retirement employment for those willing 
to work beyond 60 years of age. 
  The survey of 40,085 companies with more than 50 workers in 
Tokyo, Hokkaido and 15 other prefectures in 1992 shows that 83 
percent set the mandatory retirement age at 60, up sharply from 
65 percent in 1989, 73 percent in 1990 and 77 percent in 1991. 
  By size, 95 percent of firms with over 1,000 employees 
maintain the policy, compared with 88 percent having 300 to 499 
employees and 78 percent for those with 50 to 99 employees, the 
survey said. 
  Of the responding companies, 82 percent have established 
post-retirement employment policies, but only 30 percent hire 
those workers wishing to stay on past 60. 
  The survey shows 36 percent of companies with 50 to 99 
employees keep all workers wishing to stay on the payroll. The 
comparable figure for big firms is only 9 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- Over 50 percent of the major 
companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plan to cut the 
number of employees, particularly in clerical sections during 
the current fiscal year, a survey said Saturday [4 June]. 
  The poll, conducted by KYODO NEWS SERVICE on 100 companies 
which close the books for the business year ending March 31, 
says many corporations want to enhance corporate structure by 
adjusting employment amid the yen's surge and escalated price 
competition. 
  Of the companies polled, 21 firms said they will reduce the 
number of employees even though the economy will recover, while 
46 said they will maintain their current stance of scaling down 
the workforce for the time being, the poll said. 
  Ricoh Co., a major office automation equipment producer, 
said 
in the poll that they will cut back their workforce because a 
sharp sales rise will be unlikely amid the current tendency for 
stable economic growth. 
  All Nippon Airway Co. said they want to boost competition 
ability by streamlining management arms. 
  During the 1993 business year, 48 companies increased the 
number of employees by 9,993, while 49 companies decreased 
39,973 employees. 
  For the current fiscal year, however, only two firms said 
they will boost their workforce, while 52 companies plan to trim 
the number of workers, it said. 
  By sectors, such industries as steel, nonferrous metals, 
textiles, chemical, telecommunications and transportation will 
step up their workforce reduction plans, it said. 
  For the reasons of scaling down employment, a majority of 
companies want to strengthen competition in and outside Japan 
against falling product prices amid the yen's surge and the 
global economic slowdown. 
  They also said rising job operation efficiency needs less 
employees than ever before, the survey said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- Escalating land prices seen 
in Japan's "bubble economy" in the late 1980s and early 1990s 
will become a legend, according to a government survey released 
Sunday [5 June]. 
  The Prime Minister's Office sent questionnaires to 3,000 
people aged 20 or over in late February, of which 2,153 
responded. 
  Thirty-three percent of respondents believe land prices will 
continue to rise in the foreseeable future, compared with 75 
percent who thought so in the previous poll in June 1988. 
  Japan's land prices have taken a downward turn after peaking 
in fall 1990, after the speculative bubble economy with its 
inflated land and stock prices burst. 
  The percentage of those who said they believe prices will 
head up in the coming years fell to 31 percent, sharply down 
from 75 percent in 1988. 
  The poll showed 66 percent believe present land price levels 
are still high, with those who live in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya 
or those who do not own housing particularly saying so. 
  Nearly 60 percent said they favor current falling land 
prices 
and hope they decline further, according to the poll. 
  The percentage of those who want to have their own land and 
homes stood at 84 percent, a 14 point gain from 69 percent in 
the previous survey, it said. 
  " People are beginning to buy their own houses again as a 
result of lower land prices recently," an analyst at the Prime 
Minister's Office said. 
  The poll also found 62 percent think housing property is a 
more attractive asset in the investment portfolio than savings, 
deposits and shares.

<F P=106> [Embargoed by KYODO for release at 1700 GMT 6 June] </F>
  [Text] Paris, June 6 KYODO -- The Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has revised upward 
its 1994 economic growth forecasts for Japan, the United States, 
and Germany, OECD officials said Monday. 
  The OECD predicted Japan's economy will grow 0.8 percent for 
1994 from a year earlier, revised upward from a 0.5 percent 
growth forecast made last December. The figures, to be submitted 
to an OECD ministerial meeting to be held Tuesday and Wednesday 
in Paris, are in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), which 
measures the total value of goods and services produced within 
the country. 
  The OECD officials also said the U.S. economy will advance 
4.0 percent, compared with 3.1 percent estimated previously, and 
the German economy was forecast to grow 1.8 percent, up from the 
earlier prediction of 0.8 percent. 
  The average projected growth figure for the 25 OECD member 
countries for 1994 was given as 2.6 percent, compared with the 
previously estimated 2.1 percent. 
  The officials attributed the upward revision to the 
advancing 
U.S. economy, boosted by growing domestic demand and steady 
exports, and improved exports from Germany and other European 
nations as well as the ongoing effect of Japan's economic 
pump-priming measures launched in February. They said, however, 
that Japan's economic growth will remain sluggish, in contrast 
with the recovering world economy. The Japanese Government has 
forecast a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994 that started April 
1. 
  For 1995 projections, Japan's economy is forecast to show a 
2.7 percent year-on-year expansion, while the U.S. is projected 
to expand by 3.0 percent and germany by 2.6 percent, the 
officials said. 
  Following are the real economic growth rates in percentage 
for 1993 and their forecasts for 1994, with the December 1993 
projections in parentheses.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Some bright signs are 
visible in Japan's economy, although it is still generally 
sluggish, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in a monthly 
report Tuesday [7 Jun]. 
  An official at the agency said that the report put a "slight 
emphasis" on the bright aspects instead of on the negative 
factors. 
  "The main reason for this is that we've disregarded the view 
that industrial production is on a downtrend," he said, noting 
that the report now described industrial production as taking 
one step forward and one step back. 
  After rising 4.6 percent in March, industrial production 
posted a smaller-than-expected decline of 1.4 percent in April. 
It is expected to fall the same 1.4 percent in May and to turn 
positive in June by 1.3 percent. 
  The agency is still cautious about describing the economy as 
being on its way to recovery, however. 
  "I would not say the economy is getting better. In order to 
be able to say the economy is recovering, we need to see the 
support from capital investment," he said. 
  The report said that the employment situation is still 
harsh, 
particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, it termed 
the ratio of job openings to seekers as being flat, instead of 
on a downward trend as in its May report. 
  It also said that the unemployment rate is flat, instead of 
on the rise as it noted previously. The jobless rate improved 
from 2.9 percent in March to 2.8 percent in April. 
  Consumer spending was described as showing some signs of 
picking up -- the same wording as in the previous report. 
Household spending fell 4.3 percent in March, the biggest 
decline since February 1981, but the agency official brushed the 
fall aside, saying that the figure tends to fluctuate on the 
purchases of automobiles.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Japan's economy appears to 
have hit bottom, Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency (EPA), said Tuesday [7 Jun]. 
  "It is too early to technically declare the economy has 
reached bottom but my impression is that it has," Terasawa told 
a press conference. 
  In view of recent economic indicators, the economy has 
stopped deteriorating, the EPA chief said. 
  The comments came after the announcement earlier in the day 
of the EPA's monthly economic report, which depicted a rosier 
picture of Japan's economy by placing an emphasis on plus 
factors although the term "sluggishness" is still used. 
  Terasawa said he has been encouraged by various economic 
indicators recently showing a pickup in Japan's economy, 
including April's industrial production. 
  But he said further evidence is needed for the EPA to 
declare 
officially that the recession is over. 
  As one dismal factor still shadowing the Japanese economy, 
Terasawa cited the worsening employment situation, especially 
companies' unwillingness to recruit college graduates. 
  The pessimism surrounding the labor market apparently has 
served as a drag on the overall sentiment among corporate 
managers, Terasawa said, voicing concern over its possible 
effects on results of the Bank of Japan's quarterly business 
confidence survey conducted in May and set for release Friday. 
  Terasawa said he expects massive public works projects and 
6.2 trillion yen tax cuts to be implemented this year under the 
latest pump-priming package. 
  He said he is confident that the economy will be put on "a 
full-fledged recovery track" by the end of fiscal 1994. 
  The EPA's monthly economic report said, "the Japanese 
economy 
is showing bright signs in some sectors although it continues to 
be generally sluggish." 
  Terasawa said this is an upward revision from last month's 
description that "the economy continues to be generally sluggish 
although it is showing some bright signs."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Wholesale and retail sales in 
Japan dropped an overall 4 percent in 1993 to 673.5 trillion 
yen, registering the first consecutive yearly decline since 
statistics of the kind began in 1953, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Tuesday [7 June]. 
  Consumers have become more price-conscious amid uncertain 
prospects for employment and income under the recession, MITI 
said in a commerce survey. 
  Sales in the wholesale sector declined 4.1 percent and those 
in the retail sector 3.8 percent, both suffering a drop for the 
second year in a row, MITI said. 
  The annual survey report, called Japan's Commerce, is 
compiled on the basis of various commerce-related indicators.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The number of Japanese 
tourists going abroad in 1993 hit a record high of 11.93 million 
despite the recession-bound economy, the prime minister's office 
said Tuesday [7 Jun]. 
  The figure represented an increase of 1 percentage point 
over 
1992, the agency said in its annual white paper on tourism. 
  The agency attributed the overseas tourism boom to the 
spread 
of the five-day work week in Japan, and the yen's appreciation 
against other currencies that has bolstered the purchasing power 
of Japanese travelers. 
  Domestic tourism improved, too, with the number of those 
taking trips involving a stay of at least one night at hotels or 
inns rising 5 percent over the year before to 204 million, the 
agency said. 
  Japanese tourists at home and abroad, however, were more 
cost-conscious, with the average travel-related expenditures 
dropping by 5 percent to 148,000 yen per household, marking the 
first drop in four years. 
  By destination, travelers to the United States accounted for 
30 percent of those taking trips abroad, followed by visitors to 
South Korea at 13 percent and to Hong Kong at 11 percent. 
  Men accounted for 57 percent of overseas travelers but the 
percentage of women in the total has grown steadily in recent 
years. 
  Women in their 20s accounted for 40 percent or 2.06 million 
of the total number of female overseas travelers, the agency 
said. 
  Men in their 40s accounted for 24 percent or 1.64 million of 
the total of male overseas travelers. 
  In sharp contrast with the trend among the Japanese, the 
number of foreign visitors to Japan in 1993 fell by 5 percent 
from the previous year to 3.41 million, the agency said. 
  An agency official blamed the decline on the stronger yen, 
which squeezed the budgets of foreign tourists. 
  The growing contrast left Japan's balance of accounts in 
international tourism with a deficit of 30.93 billion dollars in 
1993. 
  Japanese travelers spent a total of 35.92 billion dollars 
for 
their overseas trips, including fares, while their foreign 
counterparts pared down their corresponding outlays to 4.99 
billion dollars, the agency said.

<F P=106> ["Past Crimes Cannot Be Hushed Up" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government 
recently "offered" to found a "fund" different from 
compensations and solve the criminal case of Japan in drafting 
"comfort women for the army" through it. 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  This shows that the Japanese Government is intending to 
avoid 
a full-scale inquiry into the case and adequate compensations 
for it and to hush up the heinous crimes of the past in a crafty 
manner. 
  The crimes committed in drafting "comfort women", a grave 
human rights abuse, are not a matter which can be solved merely 
by establishing a "fund". 
  When the former "comfort women" demanded compensations, they 
did not mean a few amount of money. Their demand is that the 
Japanese Government should make a full investigation into the 
Japanese imperialists' brutalities in the past and make a 
sincere apology for them and make adequate compensations as a 
material token of their will not to repeat such past. Whatever 
amount of money the Japanese Government may pay them, it can 
never wipe off the disgrace and heal the wounds of their past 
sufferings. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese Government authorities are going 
to put a show of solving the criminal case through the 
establishment of a "fund". This only reveals their brazen-faced 
nature, and it is an insult to the victimized "comfort women" 
and survivors. 
  The Japanese Government can never evade a judgement by 
history. The Japanese authorities must know this clearly and 
behave properly.

  "Just are Korea's proposals for the denuclearisation of the 
Korean peninsula and a peaceful solution to the Korean question. 
  "Especially, the stand maintained by Korea in the solution 
of 
the nuclear issue is a just stand which makes a great 
contribution to the efforts for peace and security in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The stand, therefore, enjoys full support 
from the world progressive people, not to speak of our people. 
  "We believe that the friendly relations between Laos and 
Korea, the relations of economic cooperation in particular, will 
be expanded and developed further."

Egyptian 
President Muhammad Husni Mubarak receiving, on 31 May, the DPRK 
delegation led by Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. At the talks, 
Kim Yong-nam conveyed greetings from DPRK President Kim Il-song 
and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to President Mubarak,

Kim Yong-nam conveyed greetings from Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il to Malaysian Prime Minister bin Mohamed Mahathir, and 
the Malaysian Foreign Minister, expressing "deep thanks" for 
this, in turn asked Kim Yong-nam to convey greetings from Prime 
Minister bin Mohamed Mahathir. Pointing out that Malaysia 
"treasures" relations with DPRK, the Malaysian Foreign Minister 
expressed "satisfaction with relations between the two countries 
that are developing in a good manner," and hoped for "further 
expansion and development of such relations." 
  PCB also mentions that Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam met and 
held talks that day with the foreign ministers of Vietnam,

  At 2200 GMT on 4 June, PCB carries a brief report on Kim 
Yong-nam meeting with foreign ministers of Syria, Libya, and 
Zimbabwe in Egypt on 1 June, during the meeting of nonaligned

Minister Kim Yong-nam conveyed greetings from Kim Il-song and 
Kim Chong-il to the Syrian president, to the leader of the Great 
1 September Revolution of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, and to the Zimbabwean president. Expressing "deep 
thanks" for this, the foreign ministers asked the DPRK Foreign 
Minister to convey greetings from the presidents of their 
countries and head of state to Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  The report adds that earlier on 31 May, Kim Yong-nam met 
with 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, and Francophone

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song's work "answers to questions raised by the 
general director of the Latin America News Agency 'PRENSA 
LATINA'" was carried by foreign newspapers. 
  It was carried by the Russian paper PATRIOT under the title 
"unanimous desire of the whole nation". 
  It was also reported by the Russian paper PRAVDA, the 
Laotian 
paper PASASON, the Indonesian paper INDONESIAN OBSERVER, the 
Lebanese paper AL SHARQ, the Tanzanian paper UHURU, the 
Senegalese paper LE TEMOIN, the Romanian paper RIPOSTA and 
magazine EUROPA, the Mexican paper LA AFICION, the Madagascan 
paper IMONGO VAOVAO, the Thai paper BAN MUANG, the Cambodian AKP 
News Agency, the State Radio of Guyana and the TV of Mongolia. 
  President Kim Il-song in the work declared that since the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been raised by the 
introduction of nuclear weapons by the United States into South 
Korea and it has emanated from the United States' hostile policy 
towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogues between 
the DPRK and the United States. 
  Noting that it is the consistent stand of the DPRK to 
resolve 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogues, 
President Kim Il-song said pressure can never be a solution to 
the problem and it is a miscalculation to think that the United 
States can bring the Korean people to their knees by means of 
pressure and force.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The fifth congress of 
the Korean Children's Union [KCU] opened with a large attendance 
at the 6,000-seat theatre of the February 8 House of Culture 
here today on the occasion of the 48th anniversary of the 
formation of KCU by the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The meeting is discussing tasks for firmly preparing the 
Children's Union members as true young guards of the Workers' 
Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  A portrait of President Kim Il-song is placed on the 
platform 
of the congress hall. 
  Participating in the congress as delegates are members of 
the 
Children's Union who have distinguished themselves in study and 
organizational life. 
  A delegation of the union of Korean children in Japan is 
also 
present at the congress. 
  Attending the congress today were Pak Song-chol, Politburo 
member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 
and vice-president, Kye Ung-tae, Politburo member and secretary 
of the C.C. [Central Committee], WPK, and other senior party and 
government cadres and officials concerned. 
  At the congress, letters and red neckerchiefs carrying the 
loyal determination of the three million KCU members to the 
great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il were conveyed to the platform by delegates from all 
provinces (municipalities). 
  A letter of congratulations sent by President Kim Il-song to 
the participants in the congress was read out by Kye Ung-tae 
there. 
  Items on the agenda "1. On tasks facing the Korean 
Children's Union in firmly preparing the KCU members as true 
young guards of the Workers' Party of Korea" and "2. On the 
amendment to the rules of the Korean Children's Union" were 
endorsed at the congress. 
  A report on the first agenda item was delivered by Choe 
Yong-hae, chairman of the Central Committee of the League of 
Socialist Working Youth of Korea. 
  The reporter said the letter of congratulations sent by the 
great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song to the participants in 
the congress is a bright torch more brightly illumining the road 
ahead of the Children's Union members advancing toward a hopeful 
future under the leadership of the party and a great programme 
of the chuche-inspired children's movement. 
  He reviewed the proud path of struggle covered by the Korean 
children's movement. 
  He said: 
  Generalissimo Kim Il-song who set out on the road of 
revolution in his early years formed the Saenal Juvenile Union, 
the first communistic children's revolutionary organization in 
Korea, thus giving glorious origin to the Korean children's 
movement. 
  The great leader closely rallied a great many children under 
the flag of the anti-Japanese children's corps and brought them 
up into child revolutionaries during the glorious period of the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, and in the post-liberation 
days formed the Korean Children's Union and set forth for the 
KCU the militant slogan "Let Us Always Study and Prepare 
Ourselves for a New Democratic Korea!" In the postwar period, he 
changed the slogan into "Let Us Always Prepare Ourselves To Be 
the Reserve Force for the Building of Communism!" to meet the 
new requirements of socialist construction. 
  Now, the Korean communist children's movement and the work 
of 
the KCU are further developing unremittingly under the correct 
guidance of respected General Kim Chong-il. 
  General Kim Chong-il expounded the idea of continuously 
carrying on the vigorous movement for learning from the glorious 
childhood and youth of the great leader as the keypoint of the 
work of the KCU. He has seen to it that all the work of the KCU 
is aimed at rearing all its members to be reliable heirs to the 
revolutionary cause of chuche, unfailingly loyal to the leader. 
  It is the greatest achievement in the work of the KCU that 
it 
has closely united its members in the same thought and purpose 
around Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il by 
rearing them to be true sons and daughters of the party who have 
a good knowledge of their leader and always follow him from 
their early years. 
  Dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: 
  "The organizations of the Korean children's union must set 
it 
as their most important task to rear all its members to be sons 
and daughters unfailingly loyal to the leader and unite them 
closely around the party." 
  The KCU organizations have vigorously carried on the 
movement 
for learning from the glorious childhood and youth of 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il among the 
union members and organized in various forms and ways education 
in the principles of the chuche idea and the revolutionary 
traditions, class education and education in socialist 
patriotism and communist morality. 
  The hearts of the members of the KCU are now filled with 
pure 
loyalty to trust and follow only Generalissimo Kim Il-song and 
General Kim Chong-il like sunflowers. 
  Strenuous efforts have been made to prepare the members of 
the KCU to be future builders of socialism with ample knowledge, 
high morality and strong body, with the result that there have 
appeared throughout the country more than 1,800 model classes 
that won "the July 15 honor prize," more than 2,400 winners of 
"the 'our classroom' literary prize," talented little artistes 
and promising sportsmen. 
  Through brisk socio-political activities and do-good-things 
movement, the members of the KCU have created over 1,127,000 
hectares of "the Children's Union forest in recent years." 
  Today the KCU has grown to be a powerful organization of 
children the 3 million members of which move as one, united 
closely around respected General Kim Chong-il, and fulfil the 
tasks set forth by the party in time with strong spirit of 
organization and discipline.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song today sent a congratulatory message to the 
participants in the fifth congress of the Korean Children's 
Union [KCU]. 
  In the message President Kim Il-song extended warm 
congratulations to those who are attending the congress and all 
the other members of the Children's Union throughout the 
country, and said the fifth congress of the Korean Children's 
Union will be a proud congress which is of great significance in 
widely demonstrating the reliable features of our schoolchildren 
growing up happily and sturdily in the embrace of the party and 
in preparing the Children's Union members firmly as successors 
to the revolution. 
  President Kim Il-song further said: 
  The Korean Children's Union, which has inherited the 
brilliant traditions of the anti-Japanese children's corps, has 
traversed a glorious path of struggle. 
  Today our Children's Union members are receiving excellent 
education and growing up as reliable reserves for the revolution 
under the care of the party. With great ambitions and hopes, 
they study hard, lead a sound life and are all well-disciplined 
and cheerful. This is a great pride and immeasurable pleasure 
of our party and our people. 
  The Children's Union members are successors to our 
revolution 
and the masters of the future. They have the honourable task of 
taking over and continuing the revolution under the 
revolutionary banner and accomplishing the revolutionary cause 
of chuche. 
  In order to succeed to the revolution, they must prepare 
themselves fully as young guards who are unfailingly loyal to 
our party. 
  Our party regards children as the most precious treasures of 
the country and spares nothing for them. The members of our 
Children's Union are happy children who were born in the era of 
the glorious Workers' Party, learn to their hearts' content, and 
grow up as happily as can be in the world. 
  They should always trust and follow only our party, taking 
an 
immense pride in that it is the best party and its embrace is 
the best embrace; they should study and live as the party 
teaches them. 
  They must inherit the revolutionary spirit of Paektu by 
studying the revolutionary traditions in good faith, and should 
follow the example of loyalty of the young revolutionaries who 
fought self-sacrificingly for the country and the revolution. 
  They must become young patriots who love the country and the 
people, hate imperialism and class enemies and devote their all 
to defending and bringing honour to our socialist country. 
  They must prepare themselves fully as well-qualified 
builders 
of socialism who are knowledgeable, morally impeccable and 
physically strong. 
  Study is the first and foremost revolutionary task of the 
members of the Children's Union. They should study hard with a 
high ambition and ideal to become able workers who will shoulder 
the future of the country. Under the motto "Let Us Study for 
Korea", they must study hard in their school days, read many 
good books, learn a useful, working knowledge and give full play 
to their talent and aptitude. 
  The Children's Union members must endeavour to build up a 
lofty moral character. They must always love their comrades, 
help and lead each other forward and devote themselves to the 
organisation and the collective. They must acquire a good 
manner of speech, behave themselves properly, respect their 
teachers and elders and be model in observing social order and 
public morality. 
  They must harden themselves physically. Only when they are 
strong, can they study hard and contribute to socialist 
construction and national defence. They must take an active 
part in various sports activities regularly to harden themselves 
and cultivate a strong fighting spirit, courage and boldness. 
  They must engage widely in socio-political activities and 
the 
good-conduct movement and they must develop the spirit of 
organisation and discipline through their organisational life 
and unfailingly live up to the oath they have made before the 
flag of the Children's Union. 
  President Kim Il-song in the message stressed: 
  You are the future and hope of our country. Only when you 
grow up healthy and strong can our country be prosperous and the 
future of the revolution be bright. 
  I firmly believe that all the Children's Union members will 
grow up into the sons and daughters boundlessly loyal to our 
party and fulfil the duties as successors to our revolution with 
credit.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on 5th Congress of Korean Children's Union" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates an editorial to the 5th Congress of the Korean 
Children's Union which opens here today on the occasion of the 
48th anniversary of the founding of the Korean Children's Union. 
  Under the wise guidance of the great leader Generalissimo 
Kim 
Il-song the flag of the Saenal Juvenile Union, the first 
communist juvenile revolutionary organisation of our country, 
was carried forward by the anti-Japanese Children's Corps and 
then by the Korean Children's Union after the liberation and the 
Korean children have vigorously traversed the road of victory 
and glory under this flag, the editorial says, and goes on: 
  The congress will be a congress of loyalty which will 
demonstrate the fervent and strong will of the 3 million members 
of the Korean Children's Union to walk with fortitude under the 
guidance of respected General Kim Chong-il the road of Paektu 
hewn by the anti-Japanese guerrillas and anti-Japanese 
children's corps members under the guidance of the great leader 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song. 
  In order to smash the anti-DPRK campaign of the imperialists 
and the reactionaries of the world and defend and exalt 
our-style socialism centering on the popular masses, it is 
imperative to direct efforts to preparing not only the party 
members and the youth but also the children. 
  There are no more important task and no greater honour to 
our 
Children's Union members today than to become true guards of the 
Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  The Children's Union members should become loyal and filial 
sons and daughters who follow General Kim Chong-il with pure 
heart and remain loyal and dutiful to him. 
  Strictly abiding by the study-first policy of the party, the 
Children's Union members should study hard, cultivate communist 
moral traits and build their physical strength. And they should 
actively participate in socio-political activities and the 
do-good-things movement and have the spirit of safeguarding the 
motherland against the aggression moves of the enemies and the 
readiness to be rifles and bombs as members of the League of 
Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] do. 
  All the members of the Children's Union should, in the 
future, too, as in the past, vigorously advance for the 
accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of chuche which 
started from Mt. Paektu, flying the red flag of the Children's 
Union as true young guards of the party, following the WPK and 
LSWYK members.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A remarkable increase 
has been registered in the output of electric power at the power 
stations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  According to data available at the State Commission of 
Electric Power Industry, the hydraulic power stations chalked up 
of late the peak in recent years in their output of electric 
power. 
  Many power stations including the March 17 united hydraulic 
power plant, the Changjagang Power Station and the Hochongang 
Power Station have lifted their daily output 20 percent above 
the same period of the preceding month. The March 17 united 
hydraulic power plant has boosted the daily electricity output 
30 percent in recent ten days. 
  The Hochongang Power Station which found reserves of 
production growth in technical innovation has rationally 
remolded the water turbines and established a more rational 
system of information transmission between the power station and 
the power distribution center, thus increasing efficiency and 
keeping production at a stable high level. 
  The Changjagang and Pujongang Power Stations are topping the 
daily quotas 9,000 to 10,000 kwh through an effective control of 
water and equipment and technical control. 
  Besides, the Changjingang Power Station, the Taechon United 
Hydraulic Power Plant and the Kanggye Youth Power Station and 
many other hydraulic power stations are overfulfilling their 
daily assignments by operating the generators at full capacity.

<F P=106> [Report by Mun Yong-nok] </F>
  [Excerpts] The functionaries, party members, and workers 
of Pyongsong City food administration highly upheld the militant 
task presented in this year's New Year Address by the great 
leader and the decisions made at the 21st plenary meeting of the 
Sixth Party Central Committee, and vigorously launched into the 
work to carry out the tasks of the first year of the adjusting 
period in unison. They were successful in producing new corn 
rice through an industrial method of which scientists in the 
related sectors had conducted research. [passage omitted] 
  Extending over several occasions, the great leader gave 
taught about improving the people's dietary life by solving the 
problem of processing corn which is produced on a large scale in 
our country. Also, the dear comrade leader personally looked 
over the corn rice newly developed at an institute in fall of 
last year and clearly elucidated the direction and method of 
producing corn rice through an industrial way. [passage omitted] 
  The new corn rice which is being produced on a large scale 
at 
this work site through an industrial method is considerably 
superior in its shape, color, and quality compared with the 
previous corn rice. 
  The new corn rice swells two times better than the previous 
corn rice and swells more than white rice. Therefore, when we 
cook the corn rice, it swells over three times. When eating, we 
can combine corn rice with the white rice or we can just eat the 
corn rice. 
  Also, since the new corn rice melts over 20 percent less 
than 
the previous corn rice, it doesn't melt well in water and its 
degree of white color and stickiness are high. Therefore, when 
this is cooked, it not only looks and tastes delicious, it is 
very digestive. 
  The new corn rice hardens over 40 percent less than the 
previous corn rice. 
  The functionaries, party members, workers, and technicians 
of 
the Pyongsong food administration work site who were successful 
in producing the new corn rice through an industrial method are 
all the more consolidating the results that have already been 
achieved, and are also achieving results in carrying out the 
work to supplement more nutritive elements for the new corn rice.

<F P=106> ["Korean People's Ideological Life Meeting Intrinsic Demand </F>
of Social Man"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article explaining that the Korean people's 
ideological life strictly meets the intrinsic demand of the 
social man. 
  Our people is leading a true ideological life in a socialist 
society centred on the popular masses, the article says, and 
goes on: 
  Our people's ideological life is suited to the nature of man 
first of all because it makes all the members of society live 
and develop as true human beings with independent ideology. 
  An ideological life assumes a class nature in all societies. 
  Socialism ensures the popular masses an ideological life 
suited to the nature of the social man. In the socialist 
society where the social and economic basis breeding outdated 
idea has been destroyed and a class confrontation removed, the 
ideological life of the people is based on the revolutionary 
idea of the working class. 
  The ideological basis of our socialism is the chuche idea, 
the greatest guiding idea of our era, and there is a 
revolutionary ideological education system established by the 
party in our country. So all the working people in our country 
are being firmly prepared to be true people with independent 
ideology and they fully enjoy a worthy life as master of their 
destiny and the master of the state and society. Today our 
people accept the chuche idea as their faith out of their vital 
demand and devote all their energy and wisdom to the 
consolidation and development of our style socialism, closely 
united around the party and the leader. And the whole society 
is overflowing with the noble communist trait of sharing the 
destiny and bitters and sweets helping and leading each other 
forward. 
  Our people's ideological life is suited to the nature of the 
social man also because it is a precious life which makes all 
the people truly glorify the noblest political integrity. 
  Man has socio-political life as well as physical life. 
Physical life is a life of man as the organism of living thing 
whereas the socio-political life is the life of man as a social 
being. Man, a social being, holds socio-political life dearer 
than physical life, and the true dignity and value of man lie in 
having and glorifying socio-political life. 
  A man can live a life worthy of humanity with 
socio-political 
life only when he shares destiny with the socio-political 
collective united organisationally and ideologically as its 
member. 
  Ours is a socialist society of singlehearted unity in which 
the leader, the party and the masses are linked together as a 
socio-political organism sharing life and death. It is the true 
look of the ideological life in our society that the entire 
people absorb the idea of the leader as the nutriments of 
political integrity and maintain blood ties with the 
socio-political organism centering around the leader, embraced 
in a political organisation. 
  Our socialism is vigorously advancing, flying high the 
banner 
victory in the grim ordeals of history, because the whole 
society is definitely swayed by the noble revolutionary 
consciousness and indomitable fighting spirit with which the 
people never give up their political faith ind principle under 
any circumstances and conditions but share the destiny with the 
party and the leader, which way the wind may blow.

<F P=106> [Article by Sin Un-chol: "Sharing Destiny With Party Is </F>
Noble Virtue of Our People"] 
  [Text] The dear comrade leader has led the party's work 
for 30 years. 
  During this period, our people were able to cherish a noble 
ideological and spiritual ethos to share their destiny with the 
party with their single-hearted unity in the course of carrying 
out the revolution, thus upholding the dear comrade leader's 
leadership. 
  We cannot talk about the might of our single-hearted unity, 
as well as the invincibility of socialism of our own style, 
without the noble ethos of our people, who share their destiny 
with the party by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Here 
lies the high valued life and honor of revolutionaries, who die 
at their post of duty by endlessly fighting on carrying out the 
revolution, thus sharing their destiny with the party. 
  Sharing destiny with the party means that one would entrust 
one's destiny to the party forever and devote one's whole life 
to achieving the party's cause. In other words, this indicates 
that one would entrust one's destiny and future to the leader 
[yongdoja], who leads the party and the revolution; willingly 
devote one's youth and life for the leader [yongdoja]; and 
contribute one's wisdom and energy on carrying out the leader's 
[yongdoja] idea and leadership. 
  Sharing destiny with the party is the most important 
ideological and spiritual ethos the people -- who carry out the 
revolution -- should cherish. 
  The destiny of the party is just the destiny of the people 
carrying out the revolution. The party provides a guideline for 
the people to pioneer their destiny and gives them a noble 
political life, as well as a power and wisdom to glorify it. 
How the people enjoy their political, material, ideological, 
and cultural life, or what their life and their next 
generation's destiny could be in the future depend on the 
leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. Only the 
people, who cherished such a truth deep in their hearts, will 
endlessly share their destiny with the party, thus firmly 
trusting in it in any difficult situation. 
  Today's circumstance in which our people carry out our 
revolution is as complicated as ever. The imperialists are 
eagerly plotting to isolate and crush [apsal] socialism of our 
own style, the life of our people. Under these circumstances, 
our people are even firmly resolved to absolutely trust in and 
defend the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and to vigorously 
carry out a struggle along the road elucidated by the party, 
thus entrusting their destiny to the party and the leader 
[suryong], no matter what they say. 
  Ranging from old anti-Japanese fighters, the first 
generation 
of our revolution, to the third or fourth generation of the 
revolution, everyone has tried to totally entrust his destiny 
and future to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and to share 
his life, joys, and sorrows with him forever. This is the firm 
faith and will of our people. Our people's ethos has been 
developed into the most noble popular-oriented ethos, with which 
our society is now overflowing, as well as becoming a powerful 
might to strengthen the party and to give impetus to socialism 
of our own style. 
  The purity of the ideological and spiritual world of our 
people, who are to share their destiny with the party, has been 
clearly shown in their firm trust in and following of the great 
leader [yongdoja] as defender of their destiny and pillar of 
their hearts. 
  In the course of the whole life of the people, who embarked 
upon the road to carry out the revolution, the leader [yongdoja] 
is the savior of their destiny, as well as the pillar of their 
hearts. The true life of the revolutionary fighters can be 
started by the great leader [yongdoja], and, also, their life 
can be glorified forever in his bosom. We cannot talk, even for 
a moment, about the destiny of revolutionaries apart from the 
leader [yongdoja]. Therefore, the people carrying out the 
revolution would be able to follow the leader [yongdoja], thus 
firmly trusting in him as the benefactor of their life and 
savior of their destiny. 
  Today, in our country all the people firmly trust and 
follow dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the guard of their 
destinies. Just like anti-Japanese fighters absolutely trusted 
and followed the great leader as the lodestar of the liberation 
and the sun of the nation in early days, our people unanimously 
and endlessly admire and follow the dear comrade leader -- who 
is warmly taking care of the people with the responsibility for 
their destinies while practicing politics of love, trust, and 
benevolence -- as a benefactor of their lives and as their 
father. 
  As has been known all over the world, Comrades Corporal Kim 
Chol- chin and Private First Class Kim Kyong-chol of the Korea 
People's Security Forces could fight being true to their 
revolutionary fidelity to the last, even under the difficult 
situation in an area occupied by the enemy, because they firmly 
trusted and followed our general from the bottom of their 
hearts. No matter how the enemy threatened and tried to win 
them over to its side, they fought with the faith that they 
could return to General Kim Chong-il's bosom without fail, 
foreseeing their bright future in the seasoned leadership of the 
great general who always turns an adverse situation into a 
favorable one and a misfortune into a fortune with his 
extraordinary wisdom, outstanding leadership, and peerless 
braveness. Their struggle clearly demonstrated to the world 
that the determination and will of our people and People's Army 
to share their destinies with the party to the last are not 
empty words. 
  Our people's absolute admiration for the dear comrade leader 
is such stout and invariable as shown above since they hold the 
greatness of the leader's [yongdoja] ideology, leadership, and 
personality through experience. No other people in the world 
but ours are firmly trusting and earnestly following their own 
leader [suryong] and leader [yongdoja] as the guard of their 
destiny and their spiritual pillar. Our people will firmly 
trust and follow the great leader and the dear comrade leader 
like heaven under any circumstance and will devote their lives 
on the road of trusting and following them. 
  The loftiness of our people's ideological and spiritual 
world 
represented by their will to share their lives with the party is 
clearly expressed by their death-defying struggle to defend and 
protect the great leader [yongdoja] politically and 
ideologically. 
  The purity of the people's ideological and spiritual world 
is 
greatly displayed in resolutely defending and protecting the 
leader [yongdoja] of the revolution. To defend and protect the 
leader [yongdoja] is the most honorable and sublime duty in the 
revolutionary struggle. A revolutionary should be an unbending 
fighter who defends and protects the party and the leader 
[suryong] under any circumstance. Only those who have resolute, 
revolutionary determination to share their destinies with the 
leader [yongdoja] and to live forever in his bosom even after 
they die can glorify their honor as genuine revolutionaries. 
  Today, our people are stoutly fighting, upholding a slogan 
of 
loyalty urging themselves to become rifles and bombs to 
death-defyingly protect the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
This slogan has a throb of the fervent loyalty of the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who, in early days, were 
willing to become human bombs to safeguard the great leader 
[suryongnim] and were willing to cast their valuable youth to 
keep secrets of the command. The slogan of resolute faith that 
expresses the will to become rifles and bombs has become an 
all-people slogan. This fact itself well shows the high level 
of the ideological and spiritual world of our people who are 
ready to share their destinies with the party. 
  Many revolutionary fighters -- who, as fortresses and 
shields, are resolutely defending and protecting the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il under any stormy circumstance and are 
willing to cast their youth and lives in the course of defending 
him -- have come forth out of our people. They are those 
revolutionary fighters who rushed into the violent fire to 
protect portraits of their leader [suryong] and leader 
[yongdoja] and those heroic fighters who sacrificed their 
valuable youth by shielding an exploring hand grenade. Even 
today, not in wartime with rain of guns and bombs, such heroes 
appear one after another. This is a proud reality that can be 
seen only in our society, a crystal of single-hearted loyalty 
and filial piety. 
  Today's reality clearly shows that there is no worthier or 
more brilliant life than that of a revolutionary fighter who is 
invincibly fighting with revolutionary resolution and 
determination to death-defyingly defend and protect the party 
and the leader. The loftiness of the ideological and spiritual 
world of our people, who share their destinies with the party, 
is also well demonstrated in the fact that they are making every 
effort to repay the grateful benevolence of the leader 
[yongdoja] who has advanced their destinies. 
  The leader's [yongdoja] boundless love and benevolence 
should 
be repaid with the fighters' trust and obedience. To repay his 
love and benevolence with trust and obedience is the 
revolutionary fighters' obligation and sense of duty. 
  All kinds of happiness, freedom, honor, and dignity that our 
people enjoy today have been prepared by the dear comrade 
leader. Without the great benevolence and love of the party and 
the leader [suryong], we can neither think of the fact that we 
have grown up to be resolute revolutionaries who contribute to 
implementing the socialist cause and to be honorable members of 
the Workers Party of Korea, nor talk about the fact that we have 
become the masters of our own destinies. This is why, whenever 
our people look up at the benevolent image of the dear comrade 
leader and think of the party's bosom, they cannot help being 
filled with strong emotion and hardening their determination to 
repay the benevolence of the party and the leader with their 
lives. This determination of our people has been hardened 
generation after generation and has become firmer as time goes 
by. 
  Today, our people are struggling with all their wisdom and 
energy to repay with loyalty the party and the leader, who gave 
them eternal political lives and advanced their genuine lives. 
Our people are burning with the sheer desire to well repay the 
great benevolence of the party and the leader. 
  Wherever the revolutionary struggle and construction are 
being carried out, we can see many loyal revolutionaries who are 
glorifying their lives by solving problems that the party is 
concerned about and intends to solve, regarding the solution of 
those problems as a worthy thing of a genuine life. If the 
party wants and intends, our people are willing to move to 
socialist construction sites, coal mines, and rural areas in 
groups and defend their revolutionary sentry posts until the end 
of their lives without wishing any honor or repayment. This 
exalted and beautiful trait is highly displayed today, and it 
well shows the lofty spiritual world of our people who try to 
devote their lives to the struggle to implement their leader's 
[yongdoja] ideology and policy, with single-hearted loyalty, 
keeping in mind the grateful benevolence of the party and the 
leader all the time. 
  Today, in our country the leader [yongdoja] and the people 
are united together and our revolution is advancing while 
overcoming hardships because all the people are faithfully 
upholding the party and the leader and sharing their destinies 
with the party. 
  All party members and working people should even more 
vigorously demonstrate the might of our party and the 
invincibility of socialism of our own style, by sharing our 
destinies with the party to the last, upholding the dear comrade 
leader and bearing the great dignity and pride in living and 
carrying out the revolution in the glorious age under his 
leadership.

  Noting that mankind is now facing a grave environmental 
problem, an article of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  One billion people live in very polluted air and about 10 
million people die annually from various diseases caused by 
polluted water worldwide. 
  In capitalist countries the monopolies operate polluting 
factories, without taking anti-pollution measure, seriously 
polluting the environment, while pursuing only profits. 
  Continuous nuclear tests and manufacture of nuclear weapons, 
nuclear war exercises let out a large amount of radioactive 
substances, gravely destroying environment. 
  Mankind demands a blue sky and clean water and air. 
  No small number of countries are increasing investments in 
the protection of environment and taking measures for preventing 
pollution. 
  Korea is called a beautiful land with thick forests and 
clean 
water, free from pollution, thanks to the correct policy of the 
Workers' Party of Korea on environmental protection. 
  A MINJU CHOSON article says: 
  The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
is making all efforts to fulfil its national duty for the 
protection of global environment. The Korean people will 
intensify the work for environmental protection together with 
all the world peaceloving people.

  [Text] New York, June 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu says that the situation over the North 
Korean nuclear dispute could change within a few days if 
Pyongyang cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] for its efforts to maintain nuclear safeguards in that 
country. "If not, North Korea could not avoid U.N. economic 
sanctions," Han told South Korean correspondents stationed in 
New York, shortly before his departure for Bejing Tuesday. 
  On President Kim Yong-sam's order, Han was heading for 
Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on 
the North Korean nuclear issue, it was announced by Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho in Seoul Tuesday night. Han had 
been scheduled to return home Tuesday from New York. He is 
expected to meet Qian Thursday to explain the results of his 
talks with U.S. Government officials and permanent members of 
the U.N. Security Council on possible sanctions against North 
Korea. 
  Han will ask China to go along with the Security Council 
after explaining to Qian that the reason South Korea, the United 
States and their allies are pursuing a resolution imposing 
sanctions on North Korea is simply because there is no other 
alternative. 
  Meeting with Korean reporters, Han said an overwhelming 
majority of the Security Council members had told him the world 
body must take strong action against North Korea. But a vote in 
the council will not come until after next week because some 
work must still be done on revising the language of a draft 
resolution by the permanent members, Han said. 
  Pressed for a comment on the possibility that China might 
oppose sanctions, Han said it appears Beijing will make up its 
mind after looking for any changes in the North Korean attitude. 
But when the Security Council adopts a resolution on sanctions, 
the situation naturally calls for such action and therefore, 
China would not be in a position to block the resolution or 
oppose it, Han said. 
  Asked about his visit to China, Han noted that every country 
in the Security Council believes that Beijing has an important 
role to play in the North Korean nuclear issue. He said he 
plans to brief Chinese leaders on the results of his 
negotiations with U.S. and Russian officials and members of the 
Security Council in New York. 
  Han said he will also ask the Chinese to continue their 
efforts to persuade North Korea to accept U.N. inspections of 
its nuclear facilities. With regard to a reported Russian 
proposal for an eight-party conference on the nuclear issue, Han 
said that is not the official Russian position. 
  Moscow was said to be pressing for such a conference, to be 
attended by representatives from the two Koreas, the United 
States, Japan, China, Russia, the IAEA and the United Nations. 
  On the possibility of multilateral sanctions being imposed 
by 
South Korea, the United States and Japan, Han said Seoul does 
not feel such sanctions are needed. Han acknowledged there would 
be some danger in the event that the United Nations slaps 
sanctions on North Korea. Nonetheless, the world body cannot 
afford to flinch because of Pyongyang's threats. Seoul will take 
realistic, effective and comprehensive measures to deal with all 
possible eventualities, Han added. In his talks with Qian, Han 
will also explain the outcome of President Kim's visits to 
Moscow and Tashkent before returning home Thursday. 
  Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Yi Sang-ok is visiting 
Beijing at the invitation of a Chinese association of diplomatic 
officials and will discuss the North Korean problem with Qian.

  [Text] It was revealed that North Korea is transferring 
[chonsu haejugo issomi] manufacturing technology for up-to-date 
biochemical weapons to the Middle East. 
  It is likely, therefore, that the German cabinet meeting 
today will work out appropriate measures against the threat of 
such mass lethal weapons imposed recently by North Korea. 
  Correspondent Yi Myong-ku reports from Berlin: 
  [Begin Yi recording] The German newspaper, DIE WELT, quoting 
an intelligence source in the West, reported that North Korea is 
selling nuclear-delivery rockets to radical states in the Middle 
East and handing over technology on biological weapons and 
chemical weapons to them. 
  This paper wrote that the nations to which North Korea is 
selling weapons are capable of paying North Korea in foreign 
currency at once, and Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Libya are included 
in these nations. 
  A German intelligence source pointed out that the arming of 
these countries with mass lethal weapons poses a direct threat 
to European countries. The source expressed worries about the 
possibility of Europe being taken hostage by these countries 
even from next year. 
  This source also revealed that some business firms in 
Europe, 
including Germany, are involved in the Middle East nations' 
manufacturing of weapons based on North Korean technology. 
  Another intelligence source pointed out, however, that 
Germany effectively blocked the weapons produced in Germany from 
being handed over to the Middle East nations, and transaction of 
such mass lethal weapons is being carried out in a more skillful 
and secret manner with each passing day. Therefore, tenacious 
efforts are necessary to prevent Arab states from arming 
themselves with such weapons. 
  Meanwhile, the German cabinet meeting to be held today will 
discuss measures to cope with the issue of uranium produced in 
the Former Soviet Union being brought into Germany and with the 
issue of the armament of Arab states with nuclear-delivery 
rockets and biochemical weapons. It was learned that a secret 
report on the proliferation of such lethal weapons will be 
submitted to today's cabinet meeting. In addition, the cabinet 
meeting will also work out effective countermeasures for the 
threat imposed by North Korea. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by ROK </F>
correspondents in New York on 7 June] 
  [Text] "China's role, too, is important in applying 
pressure on and persuading North Korea to accept the issue of 
nuclear transparency. China's cooperation is essential also in 
achieving a concerted action at the UN Security Council and in 
persuading North Korea." 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu gave New York-based ROK 
correspondents the background of his sudden visit to China by 
saying this before boarding an airplane bound for Beijing on 7 
June. After accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a visit to 
Russia, he flew to New York to have individual meetings with the 
ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security 
Council. 
  [Reporter] What is China's present position? 
  [Han] China does not readily agree to the allegation 
stressing the need to have the UN Security Council take strong 
countermeasures. But, it also is in a position not to offer 
active opposition, either. This is because China, too, cannot 
deny the fact that efforts to have dialogue with North Korea 
have reached a limit. If other permanent members of the UN 
Security Council come to a conclusion that sanctions against 
North Korea are inevitable, China will not presumably be able to 
offer opposition. 
  [Reporter] It is learned that China and Russia are objecting 
to adopting a resolution for the imposition of sanctions. 
  [Han] You can understand this by noting that a process of 
working out a resolution--not a debate of pros and cons--is now 
underway. 
  [Reporter] Russia is calling for holding eight-way talks 
before sanctions are imposed. 
  [Han] Well, Russia is not advocating such talks as a 
precondition to the UN Security Council's imposition of 
sanctions. It is certain that Russia is positive about the 
working out of measures for the imposition of sanctions. 
  [Reporter] If a resolution is adopted at the UN Security 
Council, when do you expect it will be? 
  [Han] It seems that it is difficult to see one adopted 
within 
this week. 
  [Reporter] In case the UN Security Council adopts a 
resolution, there seem to be two options, such as the adoption 
of a resolution of warning or the immediate imposition of 
sanctions. What is the official stance to this? 
  [Han] As one resolution has already been adopted and two 
Security Council presidential statements have been issued up 
until now, I think that now is not the opportune time to go out 
of the way to go through the process of adopting a resolution of 
warning. 
  [Reporter] North Korea is threatening that the present 
regime 
in South Korea will face an end if economic sanctions are 
imposed. 
  [Han] It is true that there is a risk in the imposition of 
sanctions. But, we cannot afford not to do what we should do 
because of North Korea's threatening remarks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Responsibility of Aggravating the North </F>
Korean Nuclear Situation and the Share of the United States] 
  [Text] The moves to implement sanctions on North Korea are 
an indication of the general trend in which there is no more 
room for theoretical discussion. The next step is to see when, 
what, and how sanctions will be imposed. While shouldering the 
national task for peaceful reunification, we are again heading 
toward taking a step which may propel confrontation and hatred 
instead of reconciliation, exchange, and cooperation, without 
presenting a self-reliant [chuchejok] resolution. 
  North Korea may be blamed for darkening the nuclear issue 
with its tenacious use of its nuclear card. However, the 
pushing of North Korea, which is already in a dilemma, into a 
tight corner by the United States, can not be overlooked. The 
United States once alleged that the radiochemical laboratory was 
the key to ascertaining the status of North Korea's nuclear 
development and strongly charged North Korea of blocking 
inspections. North Korea eventually allowed inspections at the 
laboratory, and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspectors reportedly extracted samples. Nothing has been 
reported about the result of the examination or analysis. 
Judging from recent developments in the situation, it is 
speculated that nothing substantial was discovered to prove that 
North Korea had secured enough plutonium to develop nuclear 
weapons. The United States and the IAEA's repeated demands for 
inspections on the two undeclared nuclear facilities strongly 
backs up this rumor. 
  The IAEA is refuting North Korea's assertion that sampling 
and examination is still possible because the removed fuel rods 
have been numbered. We do not have any scientific grounds to 
judge which side is right. Even if we accept the IAEA's 
assertion, we still doubt that this justifies the demand for 
inspections on undeclared facilities as the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty stipulates inspections on declared 
facilities only. Moreover, the United States and North Korea 
came to an agreement that inspections on the two undeclared 
facilities would be discussed at the third round of U.S.-North 
Korea talks. 
  North Korea seems to be preoccupied with the concern that 
the 
nuclear card has lost its effectiveness prior to a third-round 
of talks without guaranteeing the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with the United States. North Korea should realize, 
even at this late stage, that it was wrong from the start to 
think of using the issue of the development of nuclear weapons, 
which is invariably linked to national issues, as its bargaining 
card. 
  Reviewing developments in the North Korean nuclear issue 
during the past 15 months, it becomes apparent that the United 
States is partly responsible for the tense situation. Thus, it 
should not raise its voice for sanctions but do its best to seek 
a more effective measure to completely solve the problem. An 
unconditional third round of talks would be a desirable step 
toward this end, but if this is difficult, then at least 
conditions should be made more accessible to being accepted by 
North Korea. If, by saying "No concessions can be made," 
President Clinton meant that he does not care about any tragedy 
concerning the Korean peninsula, we who live on this land cannot 
accept this. A strong leader is more apt to have room for 
flexibility and should work toward goals flexibly.

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- National Unification 
Minister Yi Hong-ku said Wednesday that international sanctions 
against North Korea should be effective and quick but gradual. 
  Speaking to reporters over lunch, Yi predicted it would take 
two to four weeks for the UN Security Council to adopt a 
resolution calling for sanctions against North Korea. 
  By "gradual" sanctions, he meant that during each phase the 
door should remain open for negotiation depending on North 
Korea's response. 
  No uncertainty will cloud the government's policy toward the 
North Korean nuclear issue, he said. "The move to slap 
sanctions on the North this time is to honor the words that the 
North would hardly avoid sanctions if it continued refueling its 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon without the presence of 
international inspectors," he added. 
  Meanwhile, Ku Pon-tae, chief policy-maker at the National 
Unification Board, stressed the nuclear issue should not be left 
for neighboring countries and the international community to 
resolve. 
  Speaking at a policy discussion meeting of the ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party's central standing committee earlier in 
the day, Ku noted that external pressure will understandably be 
put on North Korea to pay the price if it yielded to the 
sanctions of the International Atomic energy agency or the world 
community. 
  He added that in parallel with international sanctions, 
inter-Korean efforts should be made to settle the nuclear 
question. 
  Asked about the possibility of the United States taking 
sanctions on its own, he replied that Washington has so far 
favored initial sanctions under a UN Security Council 
resolution. After these initial sanctions, the next step would 
be taken based on North Korea's response, he observed. 
  Ku predicted that escalating sanctions would have a 
tremendous impact on South Korea's economy. In order to make 
sanctions effective, the South must be prepared for all 
eventualities, including a counteraction by the North.

  [Excerpts] North Korea's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, who 
is on a visit to the Ukraine, expressed his intention on 6 June 
to positively examine Russia's proposal for holding eight-way 
talks which came up last March, thereby attracting our attention 
as we wonder if there has been any change in North Korea's 
attitude. 
  That day, Foreign Minister Kim said: "We are interested in, 
and are examining, Russia's proposal." Thus, he indirectly put 
forth a proposal for discussing North Korea's nuclear issue in 
the "eight-way talks." The proposal for eight-way talks was put 
forth by Russia on 24 March. The idea is to find a solution to 
North Korea's nuclear issue through eight-way talks involving 
South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, China, Russia, 
the United Nations, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Because the background for his remarks is unknown, it is not 
certain whether Foreign Minister Kim meant a revision of North 
Korea's "principle of solving the nuclear issue through the 
North-U.S. talks" or whether his remarks were ceremonial ones. 
But, at the present moment, the prevailing view is that those 
remarks hint of an obvious change in attitude in light of the 
fact that North Korea's nuclear issue is now in its final stages 
of discussion at the UN Security Council. [passage omitted] 
  First of all, we can interpret this as showing a change in 
its attitude because, realistically, the nuclear issue has 
already lost its value as a bargaining chip in its negotiations 
with the United States because the issue is now at a cul-de-sac 
stage when the UN Security Council is discussing the imposition 
of sanctions. As for North Korea, the only way to break through 
the present difficulty without suffering from sanctions is to 
accept the U.S. demand for ad hoc inspections and for a full 
confession. In this case, because this will be regarded as 
surrender to the United States, it will be difficult for North 
Korea to cope with the consequences. Rather, as far as North 
Korea is concerned, the eight-way talks may serve as an 
alternative because the talks can lessen North Korea's burden. 
  Of course, many people say that it is unreasonable to regard 
his remarks as showing a change in North Korea's attitude on the 
grounds that official media of North Korea are still advocating 
the solution of its nuclear issue through North-U.S. 
negotiations. 
  Those who have this kind of view see his remarks to be of a 
long-shot, public attention-arousing nature, or--in view of 
North Korea's diplomatic attitude which we have seen thus 
far--as merely a strategy to earn time to lessen the 
ever-seething international mood for the imposition of sanctions. 
  If North Korea has really changed its attitude, it is now 
clear that a new turning-point will be provided in the solution 
to North Korea's nuclear issue through dialogue--which is now at 
a deadlock--although the possibility of immediate realization of 
the eight-way talks is small because the UN Security Council has 
already begun discussing the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Han Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], strongly hinted today that there 
are still several undeclared nuclear facilities [in North Korea] 
by disclosing for the first time that it is essential to make 
approaches to more facilities, in addition to ad hoc inspections 
of two undeclared facilities, for the purpose of looking into 
the exact amount of North Korea's stockpile of plutonium. 
  In the second-day session of the IAEA Board of Governors 
held 
early this morning, Director General Han Blix made a separate 
report on North Korea's violations of the nuclear agreement in 
which he expressed with high intensity and certainty that there 
is undeclared plutonium in North Korea at the moment, while 
saying that he did not know whether it is in gram or kilogram. 
  Director General Han Blix pointed out that the two 
undeclared 
facilities, which North Korea has not opened to inspections 
claiming they are military facilities, exist within the Yongbyon 
nuclear complex. He stressed that North Korea's allegations 
they are military facilities are not sufficient to set aside 
inspection. 
  In particular, Director General Han Blix said for the first 
time that it is essential to make approaches to more facilities 
in addition to ad hoc inspections of the treatment site of 
nuclear waste materials for the purpose of looking into the 
exact amount of the plutonium produced, thereby strongly hinting 
that there are several new undeclared nuclear facilities. 
  In the meantime, the IAEA Board of Governors will adopt a 
resolution of warning against North Korea after discussing North 
Korea's nuclear issue either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Wednesday no sanction against North Korea is being 
mulled among South Korea and some of its allies outside the 
frame of the United Nations in connection with the nuclear 
question. 
  "It is not proper to discuss any sanction outside the United 
Nations at this time when international negotiations are going 
on over the issue of sanctions," the president said. 
  In an exclusive interview with the daily HANGUK ILBO on its 
40th anniversary, Kim said the most important thing under the 
circumstances is to adopt sanctions against North Korea through 
the UN Security Council. 
  The president said this is no time for South Korea and the 
United States to discuss ways to induce North Korea to come to a 
dialogue. 
  "If North Korea is interested in dialogue, Pyongyang itself 
should advance an acceptable offer," Kim said. 
  The president said he would have another telephone 
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss 
possible sanctions against North Korea. 
  He also said he does not feel the need to modify the 
government's unification policy that rules out any unification 
by means of absorbing North Korea. 
  "The government's firm policy is to promote unification step 
by step through consultations between the two Koreas," he said. 
  The president further reaffirmed that during his presidency, 
there would be no constitutional change to revise the existing 
single five-year term of presidency or in favor of a 
parliamentary cabinet system. 
  Asked if he plans to meet Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, President Kim said it would be 
unnatural for him to discuss political matters with a man who he 
said has retired from politics. 
  "But, I believe there will be some opportunity to meet him 
open-heartedly," the president said.

  [Text] The KBS Television Network conducted a poll over 
the phone with 600 male and female adults as respondents. 
  Reporter Kim Chin-suk reports on the details of the poll: 
  [Begin Kim recording] The reaction of our people to the 
possibility of North Korea's military provocation is, above all, 
negative. 
  As the result of the telephone poll of 600 male and female 
adults living in Seoul, 60 percent of the respondents said that 
even if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against 
North Korea, North Korea will not carry out a military 
provocation, and only 32 percent replied that it will commit 
military provocations. 
  Seventy-two percent of the respondents, namely three out of 
four citizens, denied the possibility of North Korea's 
triggering a full-scale war such as the 25 June Korean war on 
the Korean peninsula, and only 24 percent replied that there is 
such a possibility, thus reflecting our people's insensitivity 
to war. 
  However, more than half of the respondents pointed out 
diplomatic efforts through dialogue as effective means for 
blocking North Korea's nuclear development; 27 percent pointed 
out economic sanctions; and 15 percent pointed out South Korea's 
nuclear development. Meanwhile, 4 percent of the respondents 
stressed that a preemptive attack should be launched against 
North Korea. 
  Concerning international community sanctions against North 
Korea's nuclear development, 83 percent of the respondents 
replied that sanctions must be imposed by all means. This shows 
that most of the people are sympathetic with the necessity for 
sanctions by the international community in order to prevent 
North Korea's nuclear development. 
  In view of the results of the poll, we come to a conclusion 
that our people, based on their negative assessment of the 
possibility of North Korea's military provocation, think that 
the North Korean nuclear problem should be resolved through 
dialogue to the most possible extent, and, even if this 
resolution method is difficult, North Korea's nuclear 
development must be blocked by all means through economic 
sanctions against North Korea. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, facing 
imminent international sanctions for its suspected program to 
build nuclear arms, has intensified agitation and propaganda 
operations to stir up South Korean society, the National 
Unification Board [NUB] said Tuesday. 
  Radio Pyongyang reported Saturday that the South Korean 
government would carry out currency reform in June or July, 
citing a bulletin on "the civilian government's currency reform" 
from a ghost organization named "Hanminjon," [South Korean 
National Democratic Front] or the National Unification Front of 
Korea, NUB officials said. 
  The currency reform will devalue the won by a ratio of 100 
to 
1 and affect not only cash in circulation but also bank deposits 
and securities denominated in won, and informed Chongwadae 
[presidential offices] sources have already confirmed the 
bulletin, the report said. 
  Asserting that forged 10,000-won bills found in South Korea 
last month were the harbinger of a currency reform, North Korea 
is spreading the bulletin on currency reform in South Korea 
through its electronic media, the officials said. 
  The NODONG SINMUN, the official newspaper of the North 
Korean 
Workers' (Communist) Party, urged Southern workers, in a 
commentary carried in a recent issue, to launch a full-scale 
struggle for higher wages, reinstatement of dismissed workers 
and guaranteed labor participation in company management in 
June, while criticizing the Kim Yong-sam government's call for 
burden-sharing. 
  The North Korean propaganda machine's agitation pieces 
targeting South Korean students, workers and farmers increased 
from 32 in April to 73 in May, the officials said. 
  Pyongyang's increased anti-Seoul propaganda operations are 
aimed at disturbing South Korean society by fanning the flames 
of the "theory of June crisis" postulated by some political 
circles in the South. 
  An official from NUB said the North Korean radio report on 
currency reform in South Korea is totally groundless, calling it 
just part of the psychological warfare designed to disrupt the 
unity of the South Korean people and Government in dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  North Korea will make use of collective bargaining on wage 
hikes in June and July and a pan-national unification meeting it 
will hold at Panmunjom in August to create an anti-government 
climate and social confusion in South Korea, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam and 
members of the National Security Council [NSC], agreeing that 
international sanctions against North Korea are unavoidable, 
discussed measures Wednesday to ensure the country's security. 
  The Kim administration's first meeting of the National 
Security Council was convened by the president, as stipulated by 
the Article 91 of the Constitution, in order to handle the North 
Korean nuclear row "at the pan-national" level. 
  The council discussed steps to ensure national security and 
the survival of the entire Korean people, government officials 
said. 
  In addition, the government decided to firm up the 
cooperative arrangement with the United States, Japan, China and 
Russia to resolve the nuclear dispute, they said. 
  "North Korea has begun changing nuclear fuel rods 
one-sidedly, ignoring repeated warnings by the international 
community," Kim told the meeting. "The action seriously damaged 
the prospects for ascertaining the country's nuclear program." 
  As a result, sanctions by the U.N. Security Council against 
North Korea appear to be unavoidable, Kim said. 
  "The target of North Korea's nuclear weapons is us," Kim 
declared. "We have to stop North Korea from developing them at 
any cost." 
  Moreover, Pyongyang is heightening tension on the Korean 
peninsula by threatening to regard U.N. sanctions as a 
declaration of war, Kim charged. 
  "Tension on the Korean peninsula will continue for the time 
being," he said. 
  "Our firm belief is that North Korea should not have even 
one-half of a nuclear bomb," the president said. "This is our 
position and it cannot be revised." 
  Asserting that North Korea's unflagging determination to 
build nuclear weapons is abnormal, Kim instructed Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae to make sure that the nation's military is 
on alert against possible North Korean provocation every minute 
of the day. 
  "The transparency of North Korea's nuclear program has to be 
maintained at any cost," Kim said. 
  "We have to convey our message (to Pyongyang) that we would 
never tolerate North Korea's nuclear arms development plan," the 
president said. 
  North Korea, ignoring the new world order, is challenging 
the 
"conscience of the international community," he said. "But 
there is a limit to it (international tolerance)." 
  "Today's (NSC) meeting is attracting great interest among 
our 
people," Kim noted. "And the meeting should serve as an 
occasion to send a clear signal to North Korea as well." 
  Kim declared that today's NSC session is different from all 
previous security meetings. 
  One Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said the 
Seoul 
government has tried to resolve the issue through dialogue, but 
now "we have reached a point from where our basic policy toward 
North Korea has to change." 
  In the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku submitted a 
report in which he charged that North Korea is skillfully using 
the South's efforts to avoid war for the purposes of maintaining 
its establishment, fomenting unrest in the South and as a card 
in international negotiations. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u reported on the position of 
each of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council 
with regard to sanctions against North Korea. 
  "The cooperative system between South Korea and the United 
States against North Korean moves is firm," the vice minister 
said. 
  Defense Minister Yi analyzed all possible North Korean 
military provocations and explained the government's measures to 
counter each of them. 
  Kim Tok, director of the Agency for National Security 
Planning, told the meeting that North Korea's economy has 
registered "minus growth" in the past four years. It is now 
suffering acute food and energy shortages. 
  Although the Pyongyang government is whipping up war 
hysteria, there appear to be no unusual activities, Kim said. 
  The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, 
Deputy Prime Ministers Chong Chae-sok of the Economic Planning 
Board and Yi Hong-ku of the National Unification Board, Home 
Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong 
and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae. 
  Other officials attending were So Chong-won, first state 
minister for political affairs; Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u 
on behalf of the foreign minister; director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning Kim Tok; chief presidential secretary 
Pak Kwan-yong; Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff; Chon Yong-taek, chairman of the Emergency Planning 
Committee; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for 
foreign and national security affairs; and presidential 
spokesman Chu Ton-sik.

  [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has test-fired 
three silkworm missiles in the past one week and one of them hit 
the target, a military expert in North Korea [as received] said 
Tuesday. 
  "From their Sinsang-ri missile base near Wonsan, North Korea 
test-fired three silkworm missiles toward the East Sea [Sea of 
Japan] since May 31," he said. 
  Only one of the three hit the target about 160 kilometers 
away with two others having failed, the expert said. 
  The missiles with a range of 200 kilometers were an improved 
model of the Chinese-made 95km-range silkworm missile, he said. 
  North Korea had in the past test-fired missiles from their 
Hwajin-ri missile launching pad North of Pyongyang in the 
direction of Sinmi-do island in the West Sea, and this was the 
first time they test-fired missiles toward the East Sea, he 
added.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 (YONHAP) -- North Korea executed 
about 10 junior officers by burning late last February after 
they were caught conspiring against Kim Il-song and his 
son-heir, Kim Chong- il, it was learned here on Tuesday. 
  A source here who is well versed with North Korean affairs 
said he obtained the gruesome information from a former Chinese 
resident in Pyongyang who he said felt unsafe and fled to China. 
  The execution, according to the source, took place at the 
parade ground of Kang Kon General Military Officers School, more 
correctly a training institute for Kim Chong-il's body guards, 
located at Sinsong-tong, Sunan district, Pyongyang. 
  The condemned officers, mostly company-grade officers 
assigned to the officers school, were taken to the parade ground 
one by one, where executioners poured gasoline on them and set 
them afire in the presence of about 1,000 mobilized residents 
and party officials, the source said. 
  Among the witnessing residents were the families of the 
condemned officers, who were made to stand in front rows, he 
said. 
  The Chinese resident who witnessed the execution became so 
angered at the cruelty that he sent a letter to Beijing 
authorities to inform about the incident. 
  But, the message was detected in a postal inspection, and 
North Korean security officers had since tailed and checked him 
often. 
  "This made him feel unsafe in the North and flet to China 
recently," the source said. 
  He said that whenever an officer was excuted by burning, the 
mobilized people, acting on the initiative of party officers, 
shouted "pan-yokja" or traitor and threw rocks at them. 
  When the rumors spread among people later that the excution 
by burning was personally ordered by Kim Chong-il, the 
superintendent of the military school had disappeared, the 
source added.

  [Text] Share prices plunged across the board on the Korea 
Stock Exchange for the second consecutive day yesterday amidst 
escalating worries about the worsening crisis over the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  The composite stock price index, a yardstick of local stock 
prices, nose-dived more than 15 points in the morning session to 
914, breaking the psychological mark of 920 points at the outset 
of the session, but the early losses were partially recouped in 
the afternoon session, thanks to bargain-hunting strength. The 
index fell 8.54 points to close at 921.72 yesterday. The stock 
market closed at 930.26 last week. 
  During last week, the price index lost 15.02 points, which 
was equal to about 1.02 points, which was equal to about 1.02 
percent drop in going market value of stocks listed on the 
exchange. 
  Market analysts said the plunge in share prices for two 
consecutive days -- Saturday and yesterday -- was caused by 
investors' concern about the North Korean nuclear issue, which 
took a sharp turn for the worse when the United States, in 
coordination with Korea and Japan, moved to place sanctions 
against North Korea as Pyongyang has failed to abide by the 
IAEA's inspection procedures. The allies also weighed possible 
military options. 
  Most investors, both institutional and individuals, remained 
on the sidelines with some investors resorting to panic selling. 
  Such volume leaders as trading, banking and 
construction-related issues, which remained steady until Friday, 
lost ground as did other blue chip issues. Some 
telecommunications and oil-related issues, however, were 
actively traded in the morning session, thanks to enthusiasm in 
selective buying. 
  Stock brokers said that share prices will likely remain 
depressed for the time being with possible technical 
fluctuations as long as tension on the Korean Peninsula remains 
unchanged.

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul District 
Prosecution Wednesday summoned Yi Hak-pong, former chief 
investigator of the defunct joint investigation division of the 
Martial Law Command, as part of its probe into the Dec. 12, 
1979, "coup d'etat-like incident." 
  The prosecutors probed into how and why Yi apprehended on 
Dec. 12 Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, former Army Chief of Staff and 
martial law commander, on suspicion of abetting a rebellion 
despite an earlier announcement by the joint investigation 
division that Gen. Chong had no link with the assassination of 
former President Pak Chong-hui on Oct. 26, 1979. Yi was then 
serving as director of the division's investigation bureau. 
  Proceeding to the prosecution, Yi told reporters he took 
Chong to the investigation office at that time "to question him 
in connection with the Oct. 26 incident," adding that he had 
brought with him documents proving the suspicions about Chong. 
  Yi replied "groundless" when asked to comment on Gen. 
Chong's 
assertion that he had undergone water torture by investigators 
of the Defense Security Command's Sobingo Branch in Seoul. 
  The prosecution, meanwhile, will summon former Defense 
Minister Choe Se-chang on Friday for similar reasons.

Councilor Yun Ho-chin gave a press conference on the 
international negotiations concerning the controversy over North 
Korea's nuclear program. Alfred Schwarz attended the press 
conference for us. 
  [Schwarz] North Korea keeps insisting on its position: It 
has fulfilled all its duties toward the IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency]. What the IAEA wants from North Korea 
exceeds the IAEA's powers. North Korea will not permit this. 
This represents interference in North Korea's internal affairs, 
it was said. 
  North Korea refers to a special status, which it allegedly 
has because of the latest agreements with the IAEA. The IAEA 
categorically rejects such a special status by North Korea. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the afternoon the IAEA General Council will meet in 
Vienna. It is not expected that the IAEA will resign itself to 
North Korea's attitude. [passage omitted]

  [Text] For the first time since the establishment of a 
hotline between Chongwadae [presidential residence] and the 
Kremlin, ROK President Kim Yong-sam had conversations with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone today. They 
agreed to jointly make efforts to pass a resolution on UN 
sanctions regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  In a telephone conversation with President Boris Yeltsin, 
which lasted for 20 minutes beginning at 0635 GMT, President Kim 
Yong-sam stressed: North Korea's nuclear development should be 
practically checked by the two countries' close cooperation and 
by UN sanctions. Based on the good spirit and friendship formed 
during the past summit talks, the two leaders should make 
efforts to successfully pass the resolution at the United 
Nations. 
  By expressing his full support for it, President Boris 
Yeltsin said that he would actively cooperate on adopting the 
resolution at the United Nations and, at the same time, 
stressed: He agrees that the North Korean nuclear development 
should be practically checked in order to denuclearize the 
Korean peninsula. 
  President Kim said that we should make efforts to properly 
carry out the joint declaration agreed upon by the leaders of 
the two countries, while President Yeltsin said that the details 
of the agreement reached between the two leaders will be 
perfectly carried out, because he already approved them to be 
carried out under the supervision of responsible officials 
concerned. 
  The presidents of the two countries have reaffirmed their 
partnership relations based on their friendship and mutual trust 
formed during their talks. 
  In particular, President Yeltsin said that the two leaders 
should make efforts to develop partnership relations between the 
two countries based on their mutual trust. He also said that 
the two leaders should frequently call each other and should 
continue making efforts to maintain the friendly partnership 
relations through working-level officials. 
  President Kim expressed the hope that President Yeltsin 
could 
visit the ROK as soon as possible. Regarding this, President 
Yeltsin said that he will visit the ROK as soon as possible when 
the foreign minister makes a schedule. 
  The telephone conversation between the presidents of the two 
countries over the hotline was made as a result of President 
Yeltsin's first call to President Kim.

  [Text] Vienna, June 7 KYODO -- North Korea will "never" 
allow special international inspections of its two undeclared 
nuclear facilities suspected to be part of a secret nuclear arms 
development program, a North Korean diplomat said Tuesday [7 
June]. 
  Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, criticized a recent IAEA 
report which said Pyongyang has made it impossible to determine 
whether plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons. 
  Yun, meeting reporters at the IAEA headquarters, said the 
nuclear watchdog can carry out satisfactory inspections by 
checking fuel rods removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  His remarks came at a time when an IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting was in session and likely to demand that North Korea 
accept inspections of the two sites as a possible alternative 
means of finding out if it has been developing nuclear arms. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea sent a letter to the IAEA on Monday, 
suggesting it may withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty if the U.N. agency continues putting pressure on 
Pyongyang over the issue. 
  North Korea had rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing 
fuel rods from the reactor, which the nuclear watchdog said 
would spoil chances to determine if plutonium had been secretly 
taken from the rods to manufacture nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["We Will Determinedly Counter U.S. `Special Inspection' and </F>
`Sanctions', DPRK FM Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today answered a question put by KCNA as regards the recent 
statement of the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Gallucci, 
alleging that the DPRK has unilaterally forced core refueling, 
deliberately destroying the possibility of later measurement of 
fuel rods. 
  He said: 
  His statement is inconsistent with the fact. 
  There has been a series of contacts between us and the 
United 
States over the question of core refueling operation. 
  At the contact on May 28, we transferred to the U.S. side a 
document explaining our method of preserving the technical 
possibility of later measurement of fuel rods. 
  Expressing interest in our method, the U.S. side promised us 
to give an answer after sincerely studying it by mobilizing its 
home nuclear experts. 
  It even said that the third-stage talks would be possible, 
if 
the technical possibility were preserved, whether the pace of 
core refueling operation was fast, or not. 
  We have awaited an affirmative answer from the United 
States, 
encouraged by such attitude of it. 
  And we had the willingness to thrash out a compromise by 
coordinating the opinion that might be raised by them in the 
answer. 
  The U.S. side, however, far from giving an answer to us, 
unilaterally declared that the technical possibility for the 
measurement of fuel rods had been destroyed, timing to coincide 
with the submission of an unreasonable report by the secretariat 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  We are simply surprised by this. 
  After all, we have had no consultation with the United 
States 
on the question of the method of preserving the possibility for 
the measurement of fuel rods and have lost the last chance of 
meeting it halfway. 
  As can be seen in the above, it is not the DPRK but the 
United States that refused a compromise over the measurement of 
fuel rods and broke the foundation of the third-stage talks. 
  The United States is now coming out with the ill-boding 
assertion that since the possibility of the measurement of fuel 
rods was gone, "a special inspection" of the two military sites 
should be made. 
  Keeping pace with it, the agency is bringing forth the issue 
of "a special inspection" again. 
  So, it is obvious that the United States, ignoring our 
method, unilaterally declared that the possibility of the 
measurement of fuel rods was gone, motivated by the intention to 
invent a pretext of "a special inspection." 
  The present situation reminds us of march last year when we 
declared the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, rejecting "a special inspection." 
  The demand for "a special inspection" is a gross 
infringement 
upon our sovereignty and a graphic expression of the policy for 
stifling the DPRK. 
  The inspection of our military sites is out of question. 
  Our position for resolving the issue through dialogue and 
negotiation remains unchanged. But we will resolutely counter 
without the slightest compromise any attempt to encroach upon 
our sovereignty, crying for "a special inspection" and 
"sanctions." This is the unswerving will of all our people and 
Army.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
staged a joint air strike exercise in the skies above Oeyon and 
Tokjok Islets and Wonju of South Korea on June 4 by massively 
mobilizing some 20 fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes and 
VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes based in 
Japan proper and Kadena, Okinawa, and flying groups of the U.S. 
Air Force present in South Korea, according to military sources. 
  In separate action on the same day, formations of 
overseas-based pursuit-assault planes and fighter jets of the 
U.S. Air Force present in South Korea flew in a ground-attack 
support of puppet army units in a war exercise staged with 
Pochon, Chunchon and Kapyong areas as operational theatres. 
  Their ceaseless war rackets clearly show that the U.S. 
imperialists are rushing headlong along the road of military 
adventure against the northern half of Korea.

<F P=106> ["Premeditated Act of Military Threat" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets decided to stage a large-scale 
"Ulchi Focus Lens" joint military exercise across South Korea in 
coming August. A MINJU CHOSON analyst today brands this as part 
of their deliberate moves to push the situation of the Korean 
peninsula to a more grave phase. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets said the 
"Ulchi Focus Lens" exercise is intended to fill up the "blank" 
up to the "Team Spirit" joint military exercise which was put 
off till November. But it is a baloney meant to justify their 
military actions. 
  The last few months alone witnessed "Hwarang" war exercise 
in 
which some 1.3 million troops were mobilized, a "joint tactical 
training for the first half of this year" involving the puppet 
ground, naval and air forces, and a "large-scale combined 
landing exercise". Now, "Rimpac" war exercises are being staged 
in the Pacific by the United States, Japan, South Korean puppets 
and others. 
  These facts show that the decision to stage the "Ulchi Focus 
Lens" joint military exercise is based on a war strategy 
designed to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to a 
phase of war, not a "countermeasure". 
  If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets 
defiantly ignite a war on the Korean peninsula, they will have 
to pay dearly for it.

<F P=106> ["South Korea, a U.S. Colony"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The United States 
presents South Korea as an "independent state", but it is a 
typical colony under the U.S. political domination, military 
control and economic and cultural yoke, declares NODONG SINMUN 
in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says: 
  South Korea is subordinate to the United States politically. 
The U.S. Embassy in Seoul indicates the orientation of internal 
and external policies to the puppet government, watches and 
controls their execution, holding the right of political 
domination over South Korea. 
  The flunkeyist nature of the South Korean puppet regime 
without independence today is well illustrated by the fact that 
it is running headlong along the road of confrontation and war 
as a shock brigade in the nuclear row of its master to destroy 
the fellow countrymen. 
  After the North-South agreement and the joint declaration on 
denuclearisation were adopted and effectuated, the United States 
forced the puppets to "shelve" their implementation, crying over 
the "nuclear issue" of the North. Yielding to the pressure, the 
puppets broke up all the dialogues and exchanges which had been 
held from the period of the preceding "regimes", raising the 
"nuclear issue" of the North as a precondition for dialogue, and 
are now leaving the destiny of the nation to outside forces, 
entreating the master for "sanctions" against fellow countrymen. 
  The United States does all thing as it pleases from working 
out scinarios for framing up a "regime" and replacing it to 
choosing the "president" and changing him in South Korea. 
  It was the United States that made Kim Yong-sam, a political 
charlatan, "civilian president". 
  South Korea is totally dependent on the United States 
militarily, too. 
  The U.S. Forces commander in South Korea, holding the 
prerogative of supreme and operational command of the puppet 
army and the U.S. Forces, uses them for a military lever against 
the DPRK and other countries in Asia. 
  South Korea is thoroughly subjugated to the U.S. 
imperialists 
economically. The U.S. imperialists hold a full ideological and 
cultural "control" on South Korea. 
  The U.S. economic domination over South Korea is maintained 
by "economic aid", various "treaties" and "agreements", 
predatory machines and investments of U.S. monopoly capital. 
  By the early 1980s the United States had robbed South Korea 
of 120 billion dollars, or ten times the total "aid" granted to 
it. Through the "agreement on the transfer of finance and 
properties", the "agreement on economic and technical aid" and 
other "economic agreements" signed with the South Korean 
puppets, the United States took over the right to freely possess 
properties interested and appendages including movables and 
immovables in South Korea and seized unlimitted rights to 
infiltraoe U.S. monopoly capital into South Korea and engage in 
commerce, industry, banking and other profit-making activities. 
It takes a hand in the shaping of economic policy and drafting 
of the bugdet of the puppet government and supervises and 
controls their execution through the "U.S. International 
Development Agency" in South Korea. 
  Through the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. International 
Communication Agency, the U.S. "cultural centres" and 
"information centres" in South Korea and "agreements" on 
ideological and cultural relations concluded with the puppets, 
the United States controls education, the press, culture and art 
and religion of South Korea for ideological and cultural backing 
to the colonial enslavement policy toward South Korea. 
  It is a shame to the century and an intolerable stain on the 
era that there still remains a colony like South Korea on the 
earth when the 20th century is coming to an end.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in its 
information published on May 31 branded the Kim Yong-sam group's 
planned "monetary reform" as an out-and-out anti-popular one, 
according to Radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. 
  The information says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is compelled to force the "monetary 
reform" because it has been driven to a blind alley by the 
failure of its economic policy and political crisis. One of the 
chief aims sought by it in this "reform" is to bind working 
people to low wages and help raise the "international 
competitiveness" of big businesses at their sacrifices. 
  Most of the money to be redeemed through the "monetary 
reform" is not money of comprador businesses but of middle class 
and other people, and the money will find its way into the hands 
of comprador businesses, bringing benefits, not any losses, to 
them. 
  A buyer will suffer a bigger loss when he buys a thing with 
the newly issued money than with the former currency lower in 
value, and wages will automatically be frozen on a low scale 
and commodity prices again rise variably. It is only working 
people, after all, who will suffer from it. 
  The anti-popular "monetary reform" will drive the "civilian" 
regime now in the grip of a crisis into a hopeless pitfall of 
destruction.

affiliated with the subway trade union council held a rally in 
the Chongmyo Park in Seoul on June 2 and vowed to win in the 
wage-hike struggle for 1994, a Seoul-based radio reported. 
  Pointing to the instability of working conditions, the 
workers at the rally called for the enforcement of an 8-hour 
workday. 
  They rejected the wage hike draft agreed upon between the 
subsidized South Korean General Federation of Trade Unions 
(Nochong) and the general federation of managers councils and 
demanded a wage hike up to a level sufficient to ensure living.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets 
have committed military provocations in an unbroken chain in the 
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the Military Demarcation Line 
(MDL) in June, getting on our nerves, according to military 
sources. 
  On June 3, they openly brought recoilless guns in the DMZ in 
front of Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, in the central sector of the 
front, and two mortars in the DMZ in front of Maebong Peak in 
Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, in the Eastern sector of the front and 
installed them toward the North side and conducted fire service 
drills. 
  More than 300 fully armed bandits of the puppet army who 
scrawled into the DMZ of the central sector of the front on June 
1 and 2 maliciously got on the nerves of our People's Army 
soldiers, taking a sighting posture against the North side all 
at once. 
  The South Korean puppets illegally brought over 2,500 armed 
bandits and 1,400 odd vehicles of different types in the DMZ 
from June 1 to 4 for war exercises, search operations and 
excavation of positions. 
  Such military provocations and criminal acts were 
premeditated acts to incite the North-South confrontation and 
deliberately aggravate the situation in the DMZ. 
  We cannot overlook such hostile acts of the South Korean 
puppets, still less because they timed to coincide with the 
bellicose outbursts of the U.S. military brasshats and traitors 
against the northern half of Korea. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop acting rashly, deeply 
mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their 
military provocations and violations in the DMZ of the MDL along 
which the armed forces of the two sides stand in acute 
confrontation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Choe Yong-hae, chairman 
of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the League of Socialist 
Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK], released a statement Monday 
expressing the hope that the C.C., the LSWYK and patriotic youth

or Seoul or Panmunjom at an early date in whatever form and seek 
a way of a common struggle for the convocation of a national 
conference. 
  Stressing that the young people must take the van in 
arranging a national conference which would promote national 
reconciliation and unity, he said: "It is time we courageous 
young people took the van in paving the way for the national 
conference through a joint solidarity struggle, transcending 
differences in ideology, idea, place of residence and 
affiliation." 
  "If a contact between youth and student organizations in the 
North and the South were made, it would be possible to discuss 
wide-range issues of common concern including the convocation of 
a national conference and a August 15 Grand Reunification 
Festival of students proposed by the South Korean federation of 
general student councils at its second-term inaugural ceremony 
some time ago," he added.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Dangerous Nuclear Activities Must Be Called in </F>
Question" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] in a recent communique issued over the 
discovery of 70 kg of unaccounted-for plutonium at the Tokaimura 
nuclear fuel-making plant reportedly said it did not call it in 
question, claiming that the nuclear facilities of Japan "are 
under a complete inspection." 
  This is an extremely unreasonable act of conniving at 
Japan's 
moves to become a nuclear power and encouraging them, which 
fully reveals the double-standard policy and partiality of the 
IAEA in the solution of the nuclear issue. 
  Who believes the claim of the agency that the nuclear 
facilities of Japan "are under complete inspection"? 
  As much as 70 kg of plutonium has been accumulated and 
concealed unreported in five years at a Japan's plant where the 
agency's inspectors teams are said to be permanently stationed. 
This fact itself clearly proves that there is a problem in the 
inspection by the agency. 
  Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan 
have been in operation for scores of years, it is crystal clear 
that the recently discovered plutonium is a tiny part of the 
whole amount of hidden plutonium. 
  World opinion is demanding a probe into the truth behind the 
case out of the apprehension that a huge amount of plutonium 
might be concealed in Japan and it probably has been diverted 
to the production of nuclear weapons. 
  Nevertheless, the agency stated that it did not call the 
case 
of concealment in question. It is hardly understandable and it 
gives rise to greater doubt about the inspection by the agency. 
  The unjustifiable attitude cannot be regarded otherwise than 
a criminal act of defending the nuclear criminal who has been 
caught red-handed while wantonly violating the publicly accepted 
international law and, moreover, encouraging the nuclear 
armament of Japan which is posing a grave threat to peace and 
security on the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia. 
  The double-standard policy and partiality of the agency 
which 
calls in question the declared minimum amount of plutonium of 
the DPRK extracted for the experimental purpose, magnifying it, 
while conniving at the huge amount of unaccounted-for plutonium 
of Japan the diversion of which is highly probable, only 
undermine confidence of the international community in the

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The Japanese police 
committed another fascist brutality through a wholesale 
crackdown on the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in broad 
daylight on Monday morning amidst the ever more intensifying 
hostile acts of the Japanese authorities against Chongnyon, 
Tokyo-based Korean News Service was quoted as saying. 
  They mobilised in an attack on the headquarters more than 
250 
police on the false charge of the violation of the "land law", 
who also searched 27 places including houses of Chongnyon 
officials under the headquarters. 
  This is another unpardonable fascist suppression by the 
Japanese police following its crackdown upon the Osaka 
Prefectural organisation of Chongnyon. 
  The Japanese authorities are these days becoming all the 
more 
malicious in their attempt to stifle the DPRK through their 
conspiracy and tieup with the U.S. imperialists over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, while intensifying 
suppression of Chongnyon. 
  The Japanese authorities' acts of incriminating and 
suppressing the righteous activities of Chongnyon, a dignified 
organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, are an expression 
of their undisguised hostile policy towards the DPRK and 
Chongnyon and a grave challenge to them. 
  The Chongnyon organisation and Koreans in Japan are turning 
out in a massive protest against the outrageous suppression by 
the Japanese police.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
Organisations of Japan denounced the authorities' anti-DPRK and 
anti-Chongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan] campaign. 
  The 16th general meeting of the Miyazaki prefectural 
committee for supporting the independent and peaceful 
reunification of Korea adopted a letter of request to the prime 
minister of Japan. The request said that to make a fuss over 
the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK while covering up the nuclear 
suspicion against Japan is obviously part of the hostile policy 
toward Korea. It strongly demanded that the Japanese Government 
pursue a policy of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of 
the Korean peninsula and improvement of relations between Japan 
and the DPRK and immediately stop controlling and suppressing 
Chongnyon and Korean residents in Japan. 
  The Ibaraki prefectural headquarters of the all-Japan 
prefectural and municipal workers' union in a statement adopted 
at the 11th meeting of its executive committee on May 20 
denounced the search of the Osaka organisation of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by Japanese 
police under the pretext of "interference in the execution of 
duties" as an unreasonable political repression and demanded 
that the authorities immediately stop suppressing Chongnyon and 
rectify their hostile policy toward Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by Soe Win Nyo: "The 21-Member Orchestra"] </F>
  [Text] Many people believe that the most powerful person 
in Burma is Secretary-1 Khin Nyunt. However, Khin Nyunt is not 
the most powerful person in control of the political path of the 
country. In reality, Khin Nyunt himself, along with all the 
other members of the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration 
Council], are mere puppets being manipulated from behind the 
scenes. The body behind them is called the state's steering 
committee, led by Bo Ne Win or the 21-Member Committee. This 
body was not formed in a hurry. The 21-member Committee is a 
new name of Our (?Red Army) Group, which was formed during the 
four eights [August 1988] democratic uprising to stage 
counterstrikes and to quash the demonstrations. 
  Members of this body were hardcore BSPP [Burma Socialist 
Program Party] members, who supported the BSPP until its last 
days. They did not even join the NUP [National Unity Party] 
which is the BSPP under a new name formed without much ceremony 
to prolong its life. Among them were Sein Lwin -- known as the 
butcher of Rangoon -- Dr. Maung Maung, Aye Ko, Kyaw Htin, and 
Thura Tun Tin, and last executives of the BSPP. The purpose of 
this body is to continue holding on to national sovereignty to 
protect their lives and property. That is why they advocate the 
participation of Defense Services in the leading role in the 
future politics and making the Defense Services a government 
within the government while they try to remain as a government 
outside the government. However, unfortunately for them, there 
are two factions within the body. 
  One faction is led by the butcher Sein Lwin with Khin Nyunt 
and Myo Nyunt as members. This faction does not carry out 
political reforms at all and upholds the total (?obliteration 
policy). Another faction is led by Thura Tun Tin with Kyaw Htin 
and Dr. Maung Maung as members. This group is willing to have 
political reforms that do not affect their standing. (?Like 
killing two birds with one stone), they want to gently change 
the situation in Burma while trying to create their exit. 
  The antagonism between the two factions was evident in the 
matter over the appointment of the deputy commander in chief of 
the Defense Services. It took one year to appoint the deputy 
commander in chief of the Defense Services while the two 
factions argued over who should be selected. In the end, Maung 
Aye, who is neutral, does not belong to either faction, and gets 
along with both factions, was appointed as the deputy commander 
in chief with the consent of both factions. 
  There is antagonism between the two factions and internal 
strife within each faction. 
  Although the like-minded Sein Lwin and Khin Nyunt belong to 
the same faction, they once had differences over the so-called 
SLORC Ruby, which was smuggled out of the country by Sein Lwin 
and Naypyidaw Than Htut. Sein Lwin will never be able to 
forgive Khin Nyunt for exposing the smuggling of the SLORC Ruby. 
Sein Lwin took this incident as an extreme insult to him by 
Khin Nyunt, who is very much junior to him. Meanwhile, Khin 
Nyunt is holding this criminal act of gem smuggling as Sein 
Lwin's weak point. Both of them are selfish, arrogant, cruel, 
and cowardly. That is why it is impossible for two lions to 
share the same cave. It is the nature of cowards to strike 
first if they think they will be attacked. That is why their 
cooperation will be temporary and based on their interests. 
  Moreover, Khin Nyunt's display of influence is an annoying 
sight to others. The worst is that Khin Nyunt is acting like an 
officious person everywhere because he is being favored by Bo Ne 
Win. He is also copying Bo Ne Win's style by frequently 
presenting his wife at state functions. Nowadays, Khin Nyunt's 
wife, Dr. Khin Win Swe, appears quite often in the newspapers. 
Now Khin Nyunt is presenting his wife the way Bo Ne Win used to 
present Daw Khin May Than [Madame Ne Win]. This shows Khin 
Nyunt is aiming for Bo Ne Win's dictator post. 
  Because Bo Ne Win is still around, the antagonism between 
the 
two factions and internal strife within each faction are kept 
quiet. If Bo Ne Win dies then there will be no way to control 
the antagonism between the factions, and there will be a big 
explosion. It is certain that Ne Win is the most powerful 
person in this body. Ne Win's visit to Singapore for medical 
treatment in the last week of January clearly shows his 
influence is still maintained in this committee and in the 
Defense Services like before. 
  While meeting with Japanese journalists on 17 January, 
before 
Ne Win's visit to Singapore, Khin Nyunt said Bo Ne Win's health 
is good good with the exception of general complaints and that 
he has been staying peacefully with his family since his 
retirement from politics. Soon after Khin Nyunt's remarks, Bo 
Ne Win left for Singapore for eye and dental treatments. It 
shows Bo Ne Win still has an influence on Burma. Another point 
is a growing internal conflict in the Defense Services due to 
dissatisfaction in the Defense Services concerning Khun Nyunt's 
behavior. Nowadays there are many cases of insubordination, 
desertion, and conflicts among the regimental commanders in the 
SLORC's Defense Services. Bo Ne Win, who still has an influence 
on the Defense Services, controlled the situation without saying 
a word by presenting himself in such a way as to show that he is 
still alive and in good health, and to demonstrate that these 
things should not happen in the Defense Services. 
  Bo Ne Win did the same thing in 1989 when he attended the 
Resistance Day dinner party in his capacity as a patron of war 
veterans to control the Defense Services, which were then marked 
by a power struggle and jockeying of positions between the 
democratic-leaning commanders and commanders like Khin Nyunt, 
who are reckless and self-seeking. 
  It is certain that there are cracks appearing in their 
steering committee, and the situation of the Defense Services is 
also not so good. Moreover, their steering committee now looks 
like a damaged boat rolling from side to side and tossing on the 
waves without any control. It seems their broken boat will not 
be able to continue the journey. In accordance with its name, 
the steering committee, the committee members will have to show 
the noose to the public that will be placed around their necks 
for unjustly killing thousands of people and for the crimes they 
have committed.

<F P=106> [By Michele Cooper] </F>
  [Text] Rangoon, June 9 (AFP) -- Burma's military 
government, fearful of possible social unrest, has taken a 
conservative approach to the economy that will limit the 
potential for growth, foreign analysts here say. 
  Realising it is short on economic and financial expertise, 
the military leadership has wisely sought professional advice 
abroad. But it has proved reluctant to implement that advice in 
full, the analysts say. 
  The fear, they say, is that the drastic steps that would 
benefit Burma in the long run would have serious short-term 
repercussions on an already low standard of living among the 
populace. 
  "The military leaders are moving along at a snail's pace, 
adjusting here and twiddling there, when they should be taking 
some hard decisions for the country's future," a Western 
diplomat commented. 
  "No one wants to be another Mikhail Gorbachev," another 
diplomat said, referring to the former Soviet leader whose 
attempts at economic reform helped bring about his downfall. 
  A key issue is the devaluation of the kyat, which outside 
experts have said is essential to promote business and 
investment. One Rangoon-based businessman described the inflated 
kyat as a "tremendous barrier" to trade. 
  (The official exchange rate is about six kyats to the US 
dollar, but the widely-used black market rate is 100-120 kyats 
to the dollar.) 
  Lieutenant General Tun Kyi, minister for trade and a member 
of the ruling junta, known as the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council (SLORC), is among those who rule out a 
devaluation. 
  In a recent interview with AFP, Tun Kyi denied the inflated 
exchange rate had much of an effect on external trade, and he 
pointed to the "side effects" such as sky-rocketing domestic 
prices that devaluation would bring. 
  The real problem today, he said, is that production, which 
should be "the engine of our economic development," is 
insufficient. His priority, he said, is to boost production. 
  Tun Kyi said the government was working to eliminate 
technical barriers to trade and open the country's doors to 
business. "We want to trade and have trade relations with any 
country, big or small," he stressed. 
  Burma would also like to get credit facilities from major 
international financial institutions, but they are controlled by 
Western states which are withholding approval to underscore 
their disapproval of Rangoon's human rights record. 
  Referring obliquely to the West's policy of isolation, Tun 
Kyi stressed Burma's independent mentality. "We have some 
pride," he said. "We would rather die than beg." 
  A local businessman was more direct, asking why Burma's 42 
million people should suffer "for just one person," a reference 
to leading dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, now in her fifth year of 
house arrest. 
  A leading economist at the foreign ministry also stressed 
Burma's independent tradition, saying that the suspension of aid 
from donor countries did not worry the Burmese, who "want the 
economy back in their own hands." 
  Most analysts agreed that Rangoon would not release Aung San 
Suu Kyi in the near future, but was banking on the hoped-for 
emergence of a more pragmatic approach by the West to boost the 
economy. 
  A Western diplomat argued that the government should not 
wait 
too long to make the financial and economic adjustments 
required. After decades of isolation, "expectations are zero" 
among the populace, he said. 
  But the military government, betraying its inexperience in 
international finance, is "paranoid about creating debt," he 
said.

  [Text] Singapore says U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor's statement that the republic has not contacted the 
United States about hosting the first ministerial conference of 
the World Trade Organization [WTO] is incorrect. A Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said Singapore's permanent representative to 
the UN [in Geneva], Mr. Kesavapany, had informed all GATT 
contracting parties, including the U.S. The Singapore Embassy 
in Washington had also taken up the matter with a senior 
American trade official. 
  According to REUTERS news agency, Mr. Kantor has again 
objected to Singapore's hosting the WTO meeting. Mr. Kantor 
first raised his objection last month although U.S. officials 
said he was expressing his personal views. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman also said REUTERS' assertion 
that Singapore [words indistinct] the entire bill which is a 
departure from conference protocols was also incorrect. It is a 
normal practice for the host country to meet all the 
organizational expenses plus additional costs incurred by the 
GATT Secretariat for meetings outside its premises in Geneva. 
The recent GATT ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, the Uruguay 
Round conference in Uruguay, and other GATT meetings in 
Brussels, Belgium and Canada have all followed this practice.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Can NAM Stay Relevant?"] </F>
  [Text] At least the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has been 
spared the jibe of being "a bureaucracy in search of a pension" 
that was bevelled at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
the Commonwealth. Not that this guarantees a meaningful future. 
Lacking a self-perpetuating administrative structure, NAM 
appears to face an even more uncertain destiny, its fate being 
in the hands of its members, now numbering 109 after South 
Africa's admission at the ministerial meeting in Cairo recently. 
But, in the ultimate analysis, its ability to survive may owe 
more to the political perceptions of the leaders of these mainly 
developing nations of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Oceania 
than any rational factor. Nor may the end of the Cold War 
present NAM with its defining moment. Though global 
polarisation provided the movement's raison d'etre, its heyday 
came with the decolonisation process of the '60s. 
  Non-alignment has tried to justify its existence since then 
by claiming to be more than just neutrality between the 
superpowers. It represented, so ran the thesis, a positive 
option for peace that permitted developing countries to pursue 
their own aim of economic reconstruction without becoming bogged 
down in global rivalry. It can be argued that one set of 
challenges has now replaced another. The objective of growth 
without forfeiting political sovereignty retains its validity at 
a time when many nations of what used to be called the Third 
World are being pressured by the West, with human rights or the 
environment as the fig-leaf, to make internal changes that will 
have the effect of negating the comparative economic advantage 
they might now enjoy. Recognising that the economic agenda is 
the most important to confront its members, NAM is preparing to 
set up a coordinating committee in conjunction with the Group of 
77 to negotiate with the developed nations on trade issues. 
  But whether NAM provides the best platform for fighting what 
Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar calls "political 
conditionalities", and whether the exercise is even relevant, is 
another matter. In practice, NAM has always been noted for its 
political posturing and a tendency to pronounce on virtually 
every subject under the sun. Often, this seems to be an end in 
itself, more satisfying than trying to put an end to wars and 
violence, which was, in any case, beyond the mandate of a 
movement that had only an "exhorting effect", according to 
Professor Jayakumar, and not an "enforcing mechanism". However, 
the need for consensus decisions often meant bargains to sweep 
bilateral disputes under the carpet while pandering to the 
national susceptibilities of members. And this has not always 
added to NAM's credibility. For instance, while it is 
understandable that the outrageous conduct of the Serbs should 
arouse repugnance, the Cairo meeting's decision to allow Bosnia 
to attend as a guest of the host government, while ignoring 
Serbia's request to be represented, looked like prejudging the 
succession to the vacant Yugoslav seat. 
  More than ever now, because it is at the crossroads, NAM 
cannot afford to be seen as lacking in objectivity. The global 
situation has altered vastly since Nehru, Tito and Nasser laid 
the foundations of the non-alignment in Belgrade. Perhaps more 
to the point, as NAM looks around for an additional 
supplementary role, a number of economic organisations and 
regional groupings have sprung up. Being smaller and honed to a 
specific task, associations like ASEAN and APEC are likely to be 
far more effective than a large umbrella organisation that still 
tries, judging by the Cairo declaration, to be all things to all 
men. But their greater effectiveness may not necessarily make 
NAM redundant in the eyes of most members: many Third World 
politicians find the non-aligned forum, more intimate than the 
United Nations, both necessary and deeply fulfilling.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 8 KYODO -- Khmer Rouge leader Pol 
Pot has a serious brain illness, a Cambodian Government 
spokesman said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The spokesman did not identify his source of information. 
  Another senior government official told Kyodo News Service 
that he has not confirmed the report. 
  Pol Pot, held responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 
1970s, disappeared from public in the early 1980s. 
  He is reportedly hiding in the Thai-Cambodian border area 
and 
escaped from the Khmer Rouge's capital town of Pailin during a 
Cambodian Government offensive on the rebels' headquarters in 
March.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 8 (AFP) -- A Khmer Rouge [KR] 
official on Wednesday dismissed reports that his group's 
notorious leader Pol Pot was gravely ill in a Beijing hospital. 
  "This is not true. Pol Pot is healthy," an official at the 
radical faction's compound in the capital said. 
  Japanese newspaper Sankei quoted a diplomatic source as 
saying Pol Pot had first been hospitalised in Thailand but was 
transferred to Beijing when his condition became more serious. 
  In Phnom Penh, a Thai diplomat said he was not aware of Pol 
Pot being ill. "This is the first time I have heard this. I am 
not aware of this news." 
  A Japanese diplomat said he had seen the article but did not 
know "whether it was true." 
  Cambodian government officials said they had heard nothing 
about Pol Pot's well-being or whereabouts. 
  Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge during the 1975-1979 reign of 
terror when an estimated one million Cambodians perished. 
  The Japanese newspaper quoted military sources in Bangkok as 
saying Pol Pot had heart problems and was also believed to 
suffer from liver ailments associated with malaria and other

  Pol Pot has not been seen in public since he supposedly 
"retired" in 1981. Khieu Samphan is now the official leader of 
the radical faction but his rank is said to be nominal. 
  Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh has accused Khieu 
Samphan 
of being "Pol Pot's puppet."

  [Text] Phnom Penh 8 Jun (AKP) -- According to a report from 
Puok District, during a clash with government forces on the 
morning of 8 June, the Khmer Rouge [KR] cut the Toek Thlang 
bridge on National Route 6 on the border of Puok and Kralanh 
Districts in Siem Reap Province. 
  The report adds: "The bridge was mined by Khmer Rouge troops 
from Division 912 following an attack lasting nearly one hour." 
The report, however, does not mention any casualties. 
  Three bridges already were damaged recently: "Stoeng Preah 
(?Sre)," a stone bridge built in 1937; a bridge on National 
Route 6; and a bridge on National Route 5 in Pursat Province. 
  According to two reports from Srei Snam District and [words 
indistinct], Siem Reap Province, Khmer Rouge forces have again 
made preparations to destroy two bridges, one at "O Chik" 
between Srei Snam and Chongkal, and another along the road. The 
reports say that the same Khmer Rouge troops will launch an 
attack against the districts located near National Route 6, road 
18, before 15 June 1994.

<F P=106> [Station editorial: "What is Democratic Kampuchea? Is It a </F>
Group of a Dozen Persons or 10,000-20,000 Persons as Claimed by 
the Enemies of the Nation?"] 
  [Text] The enemies of the nation have always cursed 
Democratic Kampuchea, a force that has been fighting the 
aggressor Vietnamese to defend the Cambodian nation, race, 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity for the 
past 15 years. Some of them have claimed that there were just a 
dozen Khmer Rouge; others said there were 10,000-20,000 Khmer 
Rouge without any popular support, and so on. The Americans, 
the French, the Australians, the communist Vietnamese, the 
puppets of the communist Vietnamese, and the puppets of the 
Americans have also made the same claim. They have never ceased 
to praise themselves and their own associates. Although they 
have failed in their repeated attempts at gratifying themselves, 
they have not stopped trying to do so. 
  What is Democratic Kampuchea? How is Democratic Kampuchea? 
To understand what Democratic Kampuchea really is, let us take 
a look at the successive wars. 
  1. Just in the Vietnamese war of aggression from 1978 to 
1991, how many aggressor Vietnamese were killed on the Cambodian 
battlefield? The command of the aggressor communist Vietnamese 
admitted that 30,000 aggressor Vietnamese troops were killed and 
150,000 others were wounded. These are the figures officially 
and overtly admitted by the communist Vietnamese themselves. In 
reallity, no fewer than 100,000 aggressor Vietnamese were 
killed, no fewer than 100,000 were wounded, and no fewer than 
100,000 others deserted. In the original war when the communist 
Vietnamese first attacked Cambodia at the end of 1978, the 
aggressor communist Vietnamese used 250,000 troops. After that, 
beginning from 1980, every year the aggressor communist 
Vietnamese brought in three to four additional 10,000 to 
12,000-strong divisions. Therefore, there were no fewer than 
600,000 communist Vietnamese troops involved in Cambodia's 
invasion. Besides the soldiers, there were 50,000 civilian 
experts who were controlling their administrative apparatuses. 
Consequently, there should be no fewer than 100,000 killed, no 
fewer than 100,000 wounded, and no fewer than 100,000 deserters. 
  2. Wonder is expressed at how a few 10,000 Democratic 
Kampuchea troops were capable of defeating the communist 
Vietnamese. Analysts in general have clearly observed that 
Democratic Kampuchea has always been close to the nation and 
people throughout the country like flesh and blood or fish in 
the water. They have received all kinds of support from the 
people, especially from the peasants. The Cambodian nation and 
people have also made the same observation. 
  Therefore, if the enemies of the nation attacked Democratic 
Kampuchea it was the same thing as if they attacked the entire 
Cambodian nation and people, especially the nearly 7 million 
peasants. If they wished to carry on the war, they would surely 
meet the same fate as the other aggressors before them. 
  National opinion in all circles, be it in Phnom Penh or in 
the provinces, as well as international opinion and particularly 
the countries in the region clearly see that the attempt to 
continue kindling the war by the communist Vietnamese, the 
alliance, and their two categories of puppets cannot crush the 
Cambodian national resistance; it can only make their difference 
with the nation and people more acute and make solving the 
Cambodia problem impossible. 
  Therefore, the way to bring genuine peace back to Cambodia 
is 
to achieve national reconciliation, which is like using water to 
put off the flames of war and not adding fuel to them.

<F P=106> [Article by Ouk Kimseng: "Media Crisis Leads to </F>
Instability"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Freedom of journalism does not mean 
exclusive right or privilege to distort and slander as this 
usually causes chaos. 
  "The nation needs political stability for national 
development and rehabilitation through non-violence and national 
reconciliation" said Ieng Muly, minister of Information, at his 
audience with the common people last week. "As such, the Royal 
Government requires support and assistance from the entire 
people including the journalists," he added. 
  Since the advent of real democracy after the formation of 
the 
Royal Government, the nation has more than 30 print and 
electronic media, most of which are newspapers. 
  The Khmer language newspapers especially, have been strongly 
attacking the corrupted government officials and in the meantime 
they have denounced each other on charges of supporting the 
corrupted or being one-sided. 
  The battle of criticism against the so-called corrupted 
appears in most columns of their traditional four-page 
newspapers. 
  Stories of corruption usually look several years back when 
the country was in the middle of the nightmare of war. 
  Ieng Muli demanded the media carefully consider all sources 
and angles taken of a comment or story to be analysed. 
  Criticising the King is very sensitive to a minister who 
said: "Only with King Norodom Sihanouk can peace and national 
reconciliation be achieved." 
  Most politicians have begged journalists to be patient for 
sometime until the fragile ship of this nation successfully 
reaches the shore of real peace. 
  Dr. Barnett Baron, deputy director of Asia Foundation on his 
recent visit here, said: "Journalistic professionalism must be 
linked to responsibility in order to ensure accuracy, truth of 
news reports." 
  He was surprised with the growing number of print and 
electronic media which are on similar missions to build up and 
promote free democracy here. 
  "San Francisco, where I am from, counts only three newspaper 
organizations, while in New York there are five including the 
New York Times, the national newspaper," Barnett said. 
  So far, two newspapers have been attacked by certain circles 
in the government. 
  Editor of Damnoeng Pelproek or Morning News was detained for 
48 hours on charges of ignoring court warrants with regard to a 
clarification about a news report denouncing an official accused 
of being corrupted. 
  Circulation of the 15th issue of Sakol or "Universal" was 
interrupted and stopped for its news reports attacking King 
Norodom Sihanouk. 
  The two newspapers are now operating their businesses as 
usual.

<F P=106> [From the "A Corner of Society" column by Sergeant Tuy Kdam: </F>
"The Khmer Rouge Are Like Mosquitoes"] 
  [Text] The Khmer can be compared to mosquitoes. Should we 
let them bite us, or should we protect ourselves with mosquito 
nets or with chemical sprays potent enough to kill them? This 
remark was made by Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the 
Royal Government, when he returned home from the roundtable. 
  It is true that there are not many mosquitoes born out of 
the 
foamy mud or filthy water. To eliminate the mosquitoes from our 
houses, one of the most effective means is first for us to 
gradually fill up and do away with all the potholes and pits. 
If the mosquitoes that bite us are few in number, we just have 
to use our hands to slap them, and few of them will survive such 
a simple treatment. However, if they are too many and they keep 
harassing us, we will have to use not only nets but also 
chemical sprays to protect ourselves. The mere use of smoke 
coils or sticks will not be effective enough against them. 
  The Royal Government has made all kinds of sacrifices to 
bring peace for the people. However, the Khmer Rouge have 
refused to accept peace through cease-fire. They have resorted 
to tricks just to rekindle the dying international interest in 
their existence. 
  Right in the heart of the country, the Khmer Rouge have set 
up a newspaper [reference to PRUM BAYON NEWS, a twice weekly 
publication in Cambodian first appearing on the newstand in 
April 1994] to cause confusion in the people's mind as it has 
been working to prod its readers against the Royal Government. 
This newspaper has vociferously charged that the Royal 
Government is a warmonger. It is a kind of a stillborn 
journal... 
  This newspaper is trying to undermine peace in society and 
to 
sabotage the trust between the people and the Royal Government. 
It loftily extolls the genocidal Khmer Rouge, making them appear 
already like an overlord in Cambodia. 
  Many local situation analysts have stressed that the Royal 
Government's controlling apparatus is too lenient. We have 
tumbled to such a low state, and still we have allowed such a 
subversive Khmer Rouge newspaper to remain active! Shutting 
down the Khmer Rouge newspaper and driving the Khmer Rouge 
office out of Phnom Penh -- something we must do most urgently 
-- is already tantamount to eliminating most of the "breeding 
grounds" of these mosquitoes. 
  Before anything else, the Royal Government should take this 
measure for the sake of peace in society. If it hesitates to 
conduct such a "surgical" action, the impact of the bad 
propaganda will surely cause rapid erosion in communal peace and 
will certainly bear very serious consequences.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 7 Jun (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal Government of 
Cambodia, declared he was worried about Cambodia's environment, 
which had been seriously threatened during the past decades. 
  In his speech made on World Environment Day, the head of the 
royal government said he wanted a law on environmental 
protection to be promulgated. 
  "The war, which has lasted for over two decades, has 
destroyed the environment in the country," said Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh. "This," he said, "would plunge Cambodia into the 
abyss of disaster if we (the new generation) did not coordinate 
efforts to fight this crisis." 
  The Cambodian leader recalled that the flood of 1991, 
exceptional for Cambodia, was one of the consequences of 
environmental destruction. 
  The prince wanted severe measures to be taken to protect the 
environment, and he invited Cambodians to follow him in that 
direction. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh pledged to implement the 
UN environmental program. He thanked international 
organizations for helping to save Cambodia's environment.

    [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh KAMLANG SETTHAKECH THMEI in 
Cambodian in its 1-15 June issue carries the following reports 
concerning economic and financial issues: 
  Concerning the bill on taxes that Minister of Economy and 
Finance Sam Rangsi recently proposed to the cabinet for approval 
before presenting it to the parliament, the paper lists five 
kinds of taxes to be levied by the state. 
  The lowest personal income tax is 10 percent and the highest 
is 30 percent. 
  The rate of the construction permit duties to be applied 
preliminarily on three big cities -- Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and 
Sihanoukville -- is 30 percent. 
  The rate of corporate benefit tax is 20 percent. 
  Land taxes are divided into: 
  1. Tax on land -- 2 percent for the first year, 4 percent 
for second year, and 10 percent for the fifth year; 
  2. Tax on the gains in land values -- 10 to 30 percent for 
individuals and 20 percent for corporations; 
  3. Capital tax -- at the rate of 2 to 3 percent of the 
market prices imposed on the third extra house and up of 
city-dwelling individuals. 
  Every contract on land lease and monthly house rent needs to 
be approved by the Customs Department. The registration fee is 
1 percent of the cost of the land lease or monthly house rent. 
  In another report on cargo loading and unloading at Phnom 
Penh port, the paper cites a port official as saying that after 
the government implemented its policy of a market-oriented 
economy, the work in the 1993-94 period has improved. He added 
that due to a protracted war and since security has not yet been 
thoroughly ensured, the present volume of goods passing through 
the port is only 2 to 3 percent of the total 6,184,000 tons in 
the 1960-70 period. The amount of goods loaded and unloaded at 
the port between 1979 and 1993 is 1,870,503 tons.

  [Text] Forest area in the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic 
Republic] remains at just 11 million hectares or about 47 per 
cent of the country's total area, while the bare area has 
increased by 43 per cent or 10.2 million hectares, a report said 
at the nationwide meeting on forestation, tree nursery and land 
allocation held in Vientiane early last week. 
  The report indicated that in 1940, the country had a total 
forest area of 17 million hectares or 70 per cent of its total 
area. This forest area shrank to 12.7 million hectares by 1973 
and 11.2 million by 1981 and is 11 million at present. The 
reduction in the forest cover was the consequence of various 
practices, such as slash and burn cultivation, forest fire, and 
wanton tree-felling. 
  To restore and preserve the forest, the government has 
issued 
regulations facilitating and ensuring the plantation of trees on 
a family and business basis. Timber traders are now compelled 
to undertake tree planting. To families engaged in slash and 
burn cultivation, the government will allocate cultivation and 
production land. Those living in watershed areas will be 
allocated new settlements or assigned to rehabilitate the forest 
in their particular areas. 
  The government agencies concerned have in the past years 
made 
several efforts to protect and develop the forestry resources of 
the country with the participation of both the private and 
public sectors. This involves reforestation and restricting 
slash and burn farming, especially in mountainous areas. At the 
same time, measures have been taken against those who illegally 
fell trees and who start forest fires. 
  Sweden has assisted Laos in preserving forestry resources 
through the Lao-Swedish cooperation project for the restriction 
of slash and burn farming.

  [Text] Zamboanga, Philippines, June 8 (AFP) -- Moslem 
gunmen massacred 15 hostages, including a Catholic priest, in a 
southern island Wednesday apparently to avenge an army assault 
against Islamic fundamentalists, the military said. 
  Major General Orlando Soriano, chief of southern military 
forces, said the victims included Father Cirilo Nacorda, his 
driver, and 13 male schoolteachers, who were part of a group 
kidnapped earlier Wednesday in Basilan island. 
  Their bullet-riddled bodies were fetched by a military truck 
from where they were slain and brought to funeral parlors in 
Basilan's capital Isabela, 850 kilometres (531 miles) south of 
Manila as night fell. 
  "This is a very inhuman act. They killed them like pigs," 
Soriano told AFP, saying the victims were hogtied before they 
were lined up and gunned down. 
  He said he had asked Basilan provincial governor Gerry 
Salapuddin "to do something about this" and help "get the 
perpetrators in a few days." 
  In Manila, President Fidel Ramos issued an order to military 
commanders to "launch an all-out offensive" against the killers. 
  But he also emphasized that the safe recovery of the 
remaining teachers still being held, was to "be considered 
paramount," a palace statement said. 
  The palace also said that "the civilian population should be 
safeguarded." 
  Soriano last week ordered an offensive against the Abu 
Sayyaf, an Islamic fundamentalist group blamed for a spate of 
anti-Christian bombings and ransom kidnappings, and originally 
based in Basilan. 
  At least 30 Abu Sayyaf men were killed in the assault on 
their stronghold in Jolo island southeast of Basilan. Their main 
camp fell to the military Monday in one of the military's 
biggest offensives this year. 
  Soriano said said the kidnapping and execution of the 
captives could be in retaliation for the Jolo attack since the 
abductors are believed to be allies of the Abu Sayyaf group. 
  It could also have been aimed to divert the army's attention 
from the Jolo offensive, he added. 
  Soriano said the Moslem gunmen flagged down a convoy of 
vehicles en route to Maluso town near Isabela early Wednesday 
and seized 59 persons. Thirty-seven were released and one 
escaped, leaving 21 in their hands. 
  The gunmen separated 15 male hostages, tied their hands, 
lined them up and opened fire. The fate of the six female 
hostages was not yet known. 
  Nacorda is parish priest of Matarling town in Basilan and a 
member of the Claretian religious order. 
  His predecessor, Spanish priest Father Bernardo Blanco, 
kidnapped for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf last year but escaped. 
  Soriano said two battalions of marines have been deployed to 
cordon off the massacre site, but said there will be no 
full-scale operation immediately because this might endanger the 
lives of the remaining hostages. 
  Meanwhile, a woman was killed and 28 people were injured in 
a 
bomb explosion Wednesday night in General Santos city west of 
Basilan and Jolo in the latest wave of violence in the region. 
  Police told AFP by telephone the bomb, believed to be a 
home-made device, exploded outside a department store, 
destroying the facade, killing one woman and injuring at least 
28 people although more may have been hurt. 
  There were no immediate suspects in the bombing. 
  The Abu Sayyaf is an extremist offshoot of the Moro National 
Liberation Front, which waged a bloody war for Moslem 
independence in the 1970s but is now negotiating for political 
autonomy with the Ramos government.

  [Text] Another bombing incident took place in Mindanao, 
killing three people and injuring 35 others. According to the 
report, a homemade bomb exploded in front of the gate of 
(Kimball) Plaza in General Santos City. The explosion took 
place at around 1145 GMT. Those killed were identified as 
Catalina de la Pena, Adamalanta and Adelaida Natividad. 
Provincial Commander Romeo Pagalilawan said that there were 
three bombs planted on the site, but only one exploded. The 
other two were immediately defused by bomb disposal experts. It 
is suspected that the bombing is the work of the Abu Sayyaf 
group.

  [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) 
breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC), the Visayas 
Commission, "and other rejectionist groups" have expressed 
willingness to engage government in exploratory talks. 
  In launching the Free Lagman Movement (FILEMON) yesterday at 
the University of the Philippines PCED [expansion unknown] 
Hostel, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman disclosed his detained brother, 
acknowledged MRRC Chairman Filemon Lagman, had expressed 
willingness to represent the MRRC, the Visayas Commission, "and 
other rejectionist groups" in exploratory talks with government 
once he is released from jail. 
  It will be recalled former National Unification Commission 
Chairman Haydee Yorac had lamented government could not begin 
talks with the CPP opposition forces so long as they were not 
united and did not declare their willingness to participate in 
the peace process as a separate entity from the mainstream CPP 
forces under Netherlands-based Jose Maria [Joma] Sison. 
  "The problem government is facing right now is (how) to make 
a policy decision to release my brother, because when I last 
talked to my brother, he said his group is now willing to engage 
government in exploratory talks, with the possibility of 
developing into formal talks," the Albay congressman said. 
  "Of course, initiation of these talks will be premised on 
two 
circumstances: first is his release, because you cannot talk 
peace from a detention cell, and the second is that government 
is itself willing to talk peace," he added. 
  Visayas Commission Chairman Arturo Tabara concurred with Mr. 
Lagman's views, saying "Ine-express namin ang aming openness at 
willingness na makipag-usap sa gobyerno, pero dapat muna nilang 
palitan ang kanilang patakaran na makipag-usap lamang sa puwersa 
ni Joma (Sison) [We are expressing our openness and willingness 
to talk with the government, but their policy of talking only 
with the forces of Joma (Sison) should be replaced]." 
  "Interesado kami sa isang negotiated political settlement, 
ngunit dapat munang patunayan ng gobyerno na iaaddress nila ang 
mga root causes ng conflict [We are interested in a negotiated 
political settlement, but the government has to prove first that 
they will address the root causes of the conflict]." 
  Mr. Tabara lamented government continued to deal exclusively 
with the mainstream forces even if "the opposition represents a 
sizable force with both party members and seven (New People's 
Army) companies." 
  Mr. Lagman agreed, saying: "Government has been talking with 
Sison for how many years now, and still has nothing to show in 
the way of substantial progress." 
  "Why is this government so concerned against hurting the 
sentiments of the reaffirmist (Mr. Sison's) group by (not) 
talking with the rejectionists, if this group is not afraid of 
hurting government's sentiments?" 
  The MRRC circulated an official statement, signed by MRRC 
Chief Carlos Forte (reputed to be Filemon Lagman's pseudonym), 
which said, "We condemn government's position of excluding 
so-called CPP factions in entering into peace talks with them." 
  "The Ramos regime knows for sure that the Sison and 
(National 
Democratic Front vice-chairman for international affairs Luis) 
Jalandoni-led CPP panel does not represent the entire 
revolutionary forces in the country," the statement said. 
  "It has long been disowned by the autonomous Visayas 
Commission of the CPP and now by the equally autonomous MRRC of 
the CPP," the MRRC continued, adding, "Our openness to enter 
into peace dialogue with government is not in exchange for 
Lagman's release." 
  "First, it is our way of recognizing that revolution does 
not 
automatically mean war, and that a negotiated political 
settlement could also be effective in realizing a substantial 
part of our revolutionary program," they continued. "Second, it 
is also our way of recognizing the people's clamor to pursue far 
less bloody and violent means to attain their demands." 
  Mr. Tabara implied a negotiated political settlement with 
the 
MRRC would automatically include the Alex Boncayao Brigade 
(ABB), referring to the urban partisan unit as "the ABB of the 
Manila-Rizal region." 
  Earlier, the Lagman brothers and the MRRC had disavowed any 
link to the ABB, which has engaged in assassination campaigns 
against government counterinsurgency officials and suspected 
criminals.

  [Text] Gen. Arturo T. Enrile, chief of staff of the Armed 
Forces of the Philippines (AFP), cited yesterday the improved 
internal peace and order situation in the country as he stressed 
that "no group is capable of destabilizing the government in 
this period." 
  "I can claim with confidence that today, no domestic threat 
group is capable to mount any destabilization moves against our 
government," Enrile said. 
  Enrile, who had been promoted to a full general by President 
Ramos, AFP commander-in-chief, said the improving local peace 
and order can be attributed to the weakening forces of the 
secessionist Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the communist New People's Army 
(NPA), and the rightist Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa 
[Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] (RAM). 
  Leaders of the MNLF, led by its chairman Nur Misuari, and 
the 
RAM, headed by former Army Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio "Gringo" 
Honasan, have forged a cease-fire agreement with the government 
in view of the peace talks with the rebel groups. 
  Enrile said the combined strength of the MNLF-MILF decreased 
from 26,200 in 1988 to 19,000 this year. 
  "This figure seems immaterial as we do not anymore talk with 
them of war but of peace," the AFP chief said during a regular 
breakfast forum of the United Nations Walkers Club at the Manila 
Pavilion Hotel in Ermita. 
  The government remains optimistic on the success of the 
peace 
process with the rebel groups, he said. 
  On the communist insurgency problem, Enrile said the decline 
in the strength of the NPA, worsened by the factionalism in the 
communist movement, has already caused demoralization among the 
communists.

  [Text] The Police Department will make arrangements for 
Iranian diplomats to visit three Iranians arrested in Hat Yai 
last week in connection with an attempt to car-bomb the Israeli 
Embassy in Bangkok in March. 
  The Police Department will also ensure that the three 
suspects, now being detained at a police private training school 
in Bang Khen, are in good condition. 
  The department's pledges followed reports by an 
international 
news agency that Teheran had staged a protest early this week 
against the arrest of the suspects identified as Hossein 
Shahriari Far, Babak Taheri and Basr Kazemi. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, however, denied the 
reports, saying Iran's Foreign Ministry had only asked the Thai 
ambassador there to inform the Thai Government that it wanted 
Iranian diplomats in Bangkok to have access to the suspects. 
  Deputy police chief Phong-ammat Amattayakun yesterday 
insisted police had done their duty according to the law in 
arresting the three Iranians. 
  He guaranteed fairness for the Iranians. 
  According to Pol Gen Phong-ammat, the US Embassy in Bangkok 
has asked the Police Department for information about the 
suspects. 
  Somchai Nilaphaichit, a representative of the Muslim Lawyer 
Group, quoted the suspects as saying that they had no 
involvement with the plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and that 
they came to Thailand to do business. 
  Mr Somchai and Charan Malulin, a researcher at Chulalongkon 
University, yesterday visited the three Iranians during which he 
briefed them on Thai laws and the punishment they face if 
convicted. 
  Mr Somchai said Babak had allegedly told him he was innocent 
and that the police had no evidence against him. 
  He quoted Babak as saying that he would not have come back 
to 
Thailand if he really was involved in the foiled car-bomb plot. 
  Hossein, meanwhile, also denied involvement, reportedly 
telling Mr Somchai that he entered Thailand to extend his visa 
since he had a business concerning the trade of radio and 
television sets here. 
  Hossein also denied reports that he had relations with a 
Thai 
woman, Mr Somchai said. 
  Hossein and the other suspects were arrested at a Hat Yai 
hotel last week after immigration officers at Songkhla's Sadao 
District informed local police that his photo looked similar to 
a sketch produced by Lumphini police. 
  Hossein is wanted under an arrest warrant for allegedly 
attempting to bomb the Israeli Embassy with C-4 plastic 
explosives last March. The plan, however, failed after the 
bomb-laden six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein hit a 
motorcycle-taxi a short distance from the embassy. 
  He later allegedly abandoned the truck and fled the scene. 
The bomb hidden in a water tank in the bed of the truck, and the 
body of a Thai man were accidentally found by the truck owner 
about a week later.

  [Text] The foreign minister denies that there has been any 
protest from the Iranian Government concerning Thailand's arrest 
of Iranian nationals charged with preparing to sabotage the 
Israeli Embassy. Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri said that the Thai ambassador to Iran was invited to a 
meeting at which Iran asked Thailand to facilitate a visit with 
the arrested suspects by Iranian Embassy officials. Iran also 
asked that inquiries into the case be accelerated. The foreign 
minister thinks there should be no affect on bilateral relations: 
  [Begin Prasong recording] There is no problem; they can 
visit 
the suspects if they want to see them. Those people were 
arrested by our authorities because they committed offenses in 
Thailand. They have to undergo the process of investigation by 
our authorities. If they have relatives or lawyers, they can 
visit them. The suspects are not protected by diplomatic 
immunity and must be prosecuted. [end recording] 
  Police General Phong-amat Amatayakun, acting police director 
general, said that officials from the Iranian Embassy are 
entitled to seek information on the arrests. They can visit the 
suspects on the condition that such a move would not distort the 
case. It is the privilege of diplomats to take care of their 
own people.

    [Editorial Report] Bangkok KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT in Thai and 
Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on 8 June carry editorials on the 
arrest by Thai police of three Iranian suspects in the foiled 
attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy in March. 
  Police have finally arrested three suspects in the attempt 
to 
sabotage the Israeli Embassy by using a truck laden with C-4 
explosives, the editorial in KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT says. The 
600-word editorial, on page 2, entitled: "A Sporadic Fad Cannot 
Cope With Sabotage," believed there are more than three people 
involved in the attempt. Short of evidence and information, 
police cannot make further arrests, especially of those who are 
the masterminds behind the plot. Those people are dangerous 
because they have the power to order more operations to be 
carried out despite the fact that a number of terrorists have 
been arrested. 
  The editorial supports the instruction by the police 
director 
general who wanted investigators to urgently wrap up inquiries 
so that the three suspects can be tried by the court of justice 
and the result be made known to the public. It says: 
"Investigators should be able to produce substantial evidence 
to charge the three who are foreign nationals. Otherwise, the 
case could affect bilateral relations." There has already been 
a sign of that -- Radio Tehran yesterday reported that the 
Iranian Government had filed a protest letter to the Thai 
Government asking that a trial be carried out promptly, it says. 
  The paper concludes: "We support the order issued by the 
police director general for police to intensively monitor people 
suspected to have links with international terrorist groups and 
to tighten security for key establishments following the arrest 
of the three suspects. It goes without saying that the order 
was meant to block the attempts by terrorists to mount pressure 
on the police while investigations are being conducted against 
the three. We hope that officials will respond to the order of 
the police chief and carry out their duties seriously and 
consistently, and not just on and off as in the past." 
  MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: "The 
Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects." It also urges the police to prove 
that the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not 
just scapegoats. "Since the suspects are foreigners listed as 
members of international terrorist groups, the government 
should, in order to give more weight to the arrest, seek 
cooperation from the Malaysian Government for more information 
on the suspects as it was found that they once lived in 
Malaysia. Cooperation from Malaysia would enhance Thailand's 
credibility in doing justice to the arrested terrorists," 
MATICHON says. It also wants the government to contact Iran on 
the issue. "Iran is another country which should be able to 
supply Thailand with information about the suspects who hold 
Iranian passports," says the editorial. It adds: "Anyway, we 
cannot expect much from Iran since it is natural that Iran would 
rather be cautious and try to demonstrate that it has nothing to 
do with activities by international terrorist groups." 
  The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists 
have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. "The 
Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in 
this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out 
sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to 
danger. If they want to fight with each other to the last of 
their men, let them do that somewhere else, not in Thailand," 
the paper says. It adds that the Thai Government must also make 
that policy known to those countries which support international 
terrorism, and have them relay the message to terrorists not to 
come to Thailand.

"Sudden About-Face Makes Political Tension Worse"] 
  [Text] The Democrat Party's about face, which came abruptly 
on Tuesday night and was reconfirmed yesterday, has virtually 
dashed all hopes that the political tension which has gripped 
the country for about two weeks will come to a quick end. 
  The party made it clear that it would neither second nor 
vote 
for the motion to be submitted to Parliament calling for the 
setting up of an ad hoc committee "to compile and reword" the 
Constitution. 
  The party's sudden turnaround was in contrast to the 
position 
adopted by government "whips" on Tuesday in favour of 
constitutional and political reform. However, the whips 
maintained that the Government would not initiate the motion, 
but would leave that task to the initiative of individual MPs. 
  Noticeably, the hardline stance adopted by the majority of 
the Democrats came after Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon 
Wongwanit issued a statement through the Army spokesman pledging 
full support for the Chuan administration in the face of 
protests by hunger striker Chalat Worachat and his supporters. 
  Some observers said the army chief's pledge had encouraged 
the Democrats not to bow to the demands of the group and, at the 
same time, to further deepen the conflict with the Phalang Tham 
Party [PTP], strange bedfellow in the coalition government. 
Other observers interpreted the pledge as both a blessing and a 
warning to the Government. 
  As of yesterday, the backtracking by the Democrats and NAP 
[New Aspiration Party] left the PTP the only party to submit the 
motion. Yet, there was a split in the PTP between the ministers 
who are in favour of toeing the Democrat line and the religious 
faction which wants to keep its promise to pro-democracy groups 
to press ahead with the motion. Finally, the party reluctantly 
opted out, but individual MPs went ahead to table the motion. 
  Informed PTP sources said Chamlong Simuang, the party's 
founder, did not second the motion at the insistence of senior 
party members, who did not want him to be seen openly supporting 
Chalat and his backers. 
  Even if the PTP MPs had succeeded in submitting the motion, 
the chances appear slim that the motion will be endorsed by the 
House. None of the Democrats would vote for it, as they have 
said explicitly, nor could the PTP rely on the Opposition vote. 
Although the Opposition earlier announced that they would 
support the motion, they appeared to have changed their minds 
yesterday after learning of the Democrats' about-face. 
  Latest reports yesterday afternoon indicated that House 
Speaker Marut Bunnak, also a Democrat, had proposed to the PTP 
to withdraw the motion and offered to help resolve the dispute. 
But how he could single-handedly end the stalemate without 
support from the Democrats is anybody's guess. 
  What appears to be certain is that Chalat will not end his 
fast tomorrow as earlier predicted. He announced through his 
aides that he would end the hunger strike when the House agreed 
to form a panel to write a new charter, which had been expected 
to happen tomorrow. Now that the situation has changed, he is 
likely to continue his fast. Observers doubt that Mr Marut will 
be able to convince him to change his mind. 
  Not only have the Democrats managed to further alienate the 
PTP, they have also made more foes among their former allies, 
the pro-democracy groups which have loosely formed the 
Organisation for Political Reform in support of Chalat's hunger 
strike. Protests were reported in Nakhon Ratchasima and Maha 
Sarakham yesterday in reaction to the Democrats' backtracking. 
Observers said they anticipate more protests. 
  What have the Democrat gained from this exercise, which, as 
already seen, appears to have worsened the already tense 
political atmosphere and caused more confusion? This is not to 
mention the new wounds that have been inflicted on the coalition 
and its parties. The only consolation appears to be the Army's 
pledge to stand by the Government. 
  Analysts believe the Democrats may have felt the protest was 
the last straw and so are ready to face any consequences. The 
Democrats can effect a Cabinet reshuffle to boot out the PTP or 
to dissolve Parliament, or Prime Minister Chuan Likphai may step 
down so a new Cabinet can be formed, with the likelihood that 
the Chat Thai Party would replace the PTP. 
  With this latest move by the Democrats which has further 
deepened the chasm of mistrust between them and the PTP -- one 
may be sure that the breakup of the Government will come sooner 
than expected.

  [Ecerpt] About 5,000 people converged outside Parliament 
yesterday to demand a new constitution as the coalition allies, 
including the reluctant Phalang Tham Party, displayed a fragile 
unity behind Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's stand against 
"political intimidation". 
  Despite a common pledge not to push for the drafting of a 
new 
charter in the face of the biggest anti-government protest since 
1992, a major rift within Phalang Tham threatened to tear the 
party apart and ruin the government's questionable stability. 
  Parliament President Marut Bunnak was lobbying for a 
last-ditch option to end the political deadlock yesterday. After 
the coalition declared it would not sponsor any move to write a 
new constitution, Marut proposed that he exercise his 
parliamentary power to set up a committee to look into the 
possibility of drafting a new charter. 
  It was not known whether political action groups leading the 
constitution reform campaign would accept Marut's proposal, 
which government politicians said was in line with the 
coalition's stand that the issue was a parliamentary affair. 
  Clarifying Marut's proposal, Deputy House Speaker Thawin 
Phraison said the parliamentary president was empowered to set 
up an ad hoc committee to consider anything deemed a 
parliamentary issue. However, Thawin declined to comment on 
suggestions it was just a time-buying proposal since whatever 
such a committee produced would still have to be considered by 
the political parties. 
  In an atmosphere that eerily resembled the anti-Suchinda 
protests before they exploded into the mass uprising leading to 
the 1992 bloodshed, demonstrators yesterday loudly cheered as 
speakers lambasted the Chuan government watched by lines of 
stern police commandos. 
  Protest leaders said the turn-out was much larger than they 
had anticipated. 
  "Today is not yet the day we will shout 'Chuan get out'," 
Wira Musikaphong, recalcitrant deputy leader of the New 
Aspiration Party, told the crowd. "We are just a group of 
democratic beggars who will remain here until we get a 
satisfactory answer from the government." 
  Phalang Tham hardliner Chaiwat Sinsuwong praised two 
opposition leaders while strongly criticizing the government and 
even his own party. 
  "I have met Chat Phattana leader Chatchai Chunhawan and Chat 
Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha and I was sorry I had called 
them devils," Chaiwat said. "They understand us more than 
Chuan. What's happening in our country? Are devils becoming 
angels and vice versa -- including that damned Phalang Tham 
Party? I should have died in the (1992) May crisis." 
  Other speakers picked on the ruling Democrat Party and Prime 
Minister Chuan, calling them "liars". 
  A heavy downpour showered the protest site around 9 pm. The 
number of demonstrators then dwindled to about 1,000. 
  The military and police said they were closely monitoring 
the 
rally, which is due to resume today in front of Parliament with 
additional support from members of provincial branches of the 
pressure groups. 
  Deputy police chief Phong-amat Amattayakun said senior 
police 
officers yesterday met to discuss the political situation and 
prepare plans to cope with possible violence. 
  Initially police believed some 1,500-2,000 people would 
gather yesterday. Despite the major turn-out, Pol Gen 
Phong-amat said the situation would not escalate into violence. 
"Many people attended the rally only because they wanted to see 
At Carabao sing. They had no political motivation," he said. 
  Rock star At Carabao, or Yunyong Ophakun, has become a 
leading crusader in the campaign for a new charter. 
  Deputy metropolitan police chief Somchai Wanitseni said 
about 
155 policemen, both plain-clothed and uniformed, were stationed 
at the rally. 
  Army spokesman Phalangkun Klahan said intelligence officers 
were monitoring the situation closely. 
  Chuan refused to budge amid increasing pressure, saying his 
allies had reassured him that they would not submit a motion to 
seek a new charter if there was no co-sponsor. 
  A flurry of meetings took place yesterday. After a Phalang 
Tham meeting in the morning, government whips huddled to discuss 
the Democrats' resolution not to bow to "political intimidation" 
-- the strongest term yet to describe the campaign for 
constitutional reform. It followed allegations that activist 
Chalat Worachat's hunger strike had been exploited and had 
snowballed into an all-out attempt to topple the government. 
  After the whips' meeting, coalition leaders gathered for 
talks with Chuan. Their agreement to stick together was then 
conveyed to another tumultuous Phalang Tham meeting. 
  The party reluctantly accepted the coalition's agreement, 
but 
as a consequence the meeting was rocked by dissent. Party leader 
and Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasthian threatened to 
resign if the coalition's deal was not accepted, while 
pro-reform Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang became 
obviously upset, informed party sources said. 
  Chamlong was quoted as saying it was not right for one party 
(the Democrats) to "impose its ideas" on its allies. He said he 
was waiting for more details on Marut's efforts before deciding 
on a new move. 
  Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the coalition 
parties backtracked on an earlier compromise deal with the 
pro-reform movement because "we don't want to cheat Chalad". 
  On Monday, the government agreed to support the formation of 
a House of Representatives committee to "prepare" for the 
drafting of a new constitution. It also agreed to ask the joint 
House-Senate committee scrutinizing the opposition's charter 
amendment package to consider an additional change which would 
legitimize the promulgation of a brand new charter. 
  Chuan summoned key Democrat leaders to an emergency meeting 
late last night.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by station correspondent Diep Anh in Kiev] </F>
  [Summary] "Dear friends: At 1000 local time -- 1300 Hanoi 
time -- on 8 June the airplane carrying Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet, his wife, and his entourages touched down 
at (Boristol) International Airport in the suburbs of Kiev, the 
capital of the Republic of Ukraine. This signaled the start of 
the prime minister's official visit to Ukraine and some other 
republics of the Commonwealth of Independence States." 
  The international airport was decorated with the flags of 
the 
two countries. "Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy and other 
Ukrainian officials greeted the prime minister and his wife at 
the ramp of the plane." 
  The Ukrainian acting prime minister invited Prime Minister 
Vo 
Van Kiet to step onto a raised dais and the welcoming ceremony 
began. After the national anthems of the two countries were 
played by a military band, the Ukrainian acting prime minister 
escorted Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as he reviewed the honor 
guard. 
  The prime minister was introduced to various Ukrainian 
well-wishers, including Foreign Minister Zlenko, Kiev Mayor 
(Kozokoski), and others. For his part, the prime minister 
introduced his entourage to the Ukrainian acting prime minister. 
The entourage includes Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam; Le 
Xuan Trinh, minister of state and head of the Government Office; 
Industry and Environment Minister Dang Huu; and others. 
  "Immediately after the prime minister's motorcade arrived in 
downtown Kiev, the Vietnamese and Ukrainian sides held talks at 
the office of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers. Attending the 
talks on the Ukrainian side were Acting Prime Minister 
Zvyahilskyy, Foreign Minister Zlenko, and representatives of 
concerned ministries and sectors. The Vietnamese side was 
represented by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam, Government Office head Le Xuan Trinh, and other 
comrades." 
  "In an open-minded and sincere atmosphere, the two sides 
informed each other of the situation in various respects in 
their countries, covering the difficulties encountered and the 
achievements made by each country as well as their prospects in 
the cause of carrying out economic construction and stabilizing 
people's lives. 
  "The two sides jointly examined issues relating to bilateral 
relations, the huge potential the two sides can exploit on a 
mutually-beneficial basis, and specific guidelines for better 
cooperation in the future. Common issues of mutual concern 
regarding the international and regional situations were also 
raised by the two sides so that joint efforts can be made to 
achieve peace and stability and resolve all conflicts and 
disputes between countries in the region through negotiations. 
  "The talks ended amid an elated atmosphere of mutual 
understanding, indicating a bright future marked by bilateral 
relations of friendship and cooperation."

  [Summary] "The fifth session of the Ninth National 
Assembly entered its 12th day today. In the morning, deputies 
studied documents in preparation for their afternoon group 
discussions on the draft civil code. 
  "All the views aired focused on some major issues such as 
the 
issue of marriage and families, the issue of transfer of 
land-use rights within areas stipulated by the civil code, the 
substance of civil relations, the issue of ownership, and the 
issue of civil contracts. 
  "Generally speaking, all the debaters favored the idea of 
promptly approving the civil code since it is a very important 
law that has great impact on general social activities." 
  Some deputies expressed the view that although many laws 
have 
been promulgated by our state over the past 10 years, numerous 
issues have still been left unadjusted by the legislative 
sector. This has created considerable difficulties for those 
organs in charge of adjudicating civil disputes. "In reality, 
many cases of violation of the rights and the legitimate 
interests of individuals, collectives, and the state have 
occurred and there has been a failure to clearly define the 
legal position of foreigners in Vietnam. That is why a prompt 
promulgation of the civil code is necessary." 
  The National Assembly deputies will continue their group 
discussions on the draft civil code tomorrow morning. They will 
work at the conference hall in the afternoon.

  [Text] Australia's parliament has set out a proposed 
timetable for a cease-fire and a peace settlement to resolve the 
five-and-a-half-year conflict on Bougainville. The report of 
the Australian parliamentary delegation, which visited 
Bougainville in April, was welcomed by the Australian 
Government. The report calls for a cease-fire negotiated by 
Bougainville interim authority, local chiefs, the police and 
defense forces, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA], and 
the extra-legal resistant forces. 
  The peace timetable calls for several weeks of consultations 
and community meetings, agreement on a neutral chairman and 
agenda, and parallel talks with the Papua New Guinea Government 
and the BRA. Pacific island neighbors could provide natural 
observers and they should be a guarantee of safety for all 
participants. The report said Australia should offer to host 
and support talks either in Bougainville or in the north 
Queensland city of Cairns. The Australian parliamentarians 
strongly recommended that the Papua New Guinea Government 
authority should allow relief supplies to be delivered to the 
whole of Bougainville.

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Gill under the rubric "Opinion": "US in </F>
Need of More Dexterity"] 
  Americans have never coped well with the possibility they 
might be wrong. Even as others notice that Washington is 
conspicuously out of step with the Asia Pacific region, the 
Administration maintains the fiction that everyone else is 
putting the wrong foot forward. 
  An important test of that perception will come next week 
when 
President Clinton decides whether to revoke China's "most 
favoured nation" [MFN] trading status. 
  US singlemindedness on such issues as human rights (China 
and 
Burma), trade barriers (Japan), labour standards (Indonesia and 
the World Trade Organisation) and even Singapore's corporal 
punishment regime, could have serious implications beyond the 
Beltway. 
  There is a strong chance the "tough" US stand on such issues 
will undermine useful initiatives like the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation [APEC] forum in which its protagonists are members. 
  Place APEC at risk and you threaten the foundations of the 
entire foreign-trade policy strategy to which the Keating 
Government is now so strongly attached. 
  Indeed, unless APEC remains a credible centrepiece of 
regional relationships in the Asia Pacific, Australia will be 
left facing a dangerous vacuum. Bilateral relationships can 
never, for a medium-sized power like Australia, substitute for 
the clout of an effective region-wide body like APEC when it 
comes to shaping the environment in which business is conducted. 
  Recent events have already shown it is not possible to 
quarantine from APEC the impact of an aggressive US stand on 
issues of regional sensitivity. 
  An informal APEC trade ministers meeting in the margins of 
the GATT finale in Marrakech, Morocco, last month was pervaded 
by the antagonism generated by US attempts -- ultimately 
successful -- to get labour standards onto the agenda of the new 
World Trade Organisation. 
  The developing world, in particular the ASEAN, remains 
unconvinced by US claims that its position on labour standards 
is based on a concern for human rights and adequate working 
conditions. 
  Instead, they see it as undisguised protectionism aimed at 
cutting the developing countries' comparative advantage of cheap 
labour. As Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir put to a 
receptive Beijing audience two weeks ago: "(The) professed 
concern about workers' welfare is motivated by selfish interest." 
  At the Marrakech meeting, ASEAN showed its discontent. A US 
offer to host an upcoming APEC trade ministers meeting was 
rejected in favour of a rendezvous in Indonesia -- on ASEAN turf. 
  Workers' rights is one of a number of sensitive issues where 
the US has shown an apparent disregard for the views of Asian 
nations or given a relatively unsophisticated response to any 
alternative opinion. 
  Relationships with Burma's military regime is another. 
Again, there are no shades of grey in Washington's foreign 
policy filter. The US wants Burma isolated while ASEAN is 
pursuing constructive "engagement". 
  Sanctions threats are also the preferred device to pressure 
China on human rights and Japan on trade. 
  The face-saving formula announced yesterday by the US and 
Japan to revive their trade talks retains retaliation as a US 
response if Japan fails to open its markets to the extent 
required by Washington. Meanwhile, US protectionism -- in areas 
as diverse as agriculture, entertainment, and government 
procurement -- continues unabated. 
  Senior US officials seem to take an almost perverse pride in 
maintaining that while many countries support US trade and 
foreign policy goals, few support its methods. And little 
effort is made to engender more positive views of the US in Asia. 
  From a country where respect for the law is profound, US 
President Clinton inexplicably cast doubt over the integrity of 
the Singaporean justice system by implying the recent vandalism 
confession of Michael Fay may have been coerced. 
  US Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, compounded the 
President's indiscretion. He said the US would oppose 
Singapore's hosting of the first World Trade Organisation 
ministerial meeting next year -- a move widely regarded as 
retaliation for the caning of a US citizen. 
  But the bruised backside of a US teenager fades by 
comparison 
with the possible impact of a withdrawal of China's most 
favoured nation status. MFN gives the emerging economic giant 
of North Asia the same access as others to the US market. Its 
removal would have a devastating impact on China's economy and 
cause collateral damage throughout the region. 
  The President, and Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, 
have been strongly counselled against such a move by many 
outsiders, including Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
Gareth Evans. 
  Insiders are now also sounding the alarm. According to a 
recent Washington Post report of a confidential memo from 
Winston Lord to his boss Warren Christopher, the Assistant 
Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs warned: "A series of 
American measures, threatened or employed, risk corroding our 
positive image in the region, giving ammunition to those 
charging we are an international nanny, if not a bully." 
  "Without proper course adjustments, we could subvert our 
influence and interests," Lord said. 
  The Lord warning -- which cited Evans' criticism -- is being 
interpreted in some quarters as reflecting a greater awareness 
and recognition of regional sensitivities. A wider review of US 
policy might even be under way. 
  Or Washington may simply have recognised it needs China's 
support, or at least acquiescence, in any attempt to curb North 
Korea's nuclear ambitions. 
  President Clinton's June 3 decision on China's trade status 
will show whether Washington has started to develop the policy 
dexterity required for a constructive relationship with the 
region.

<F P=106> [By Jack Taylor] </F>
  [Text] Sydney, June 8 (AFP) -- Canberra was under mounting 
pressure Wednesday to answer charges its counter-intelligence 
service was in "a state of crisis" amid claims it had been 
forced to sack three more agents for alleged spying. 
  An opposition MP said the three, all Russian-language 
experts, had been dismissed by the Australian Security 
Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) on suspicion of having 
compromised national security. 
  Liberal backbencher Ken Aldred, responsible for a series of 
disclosures about Russian espionage activities here, claims ASIO 
decided not to charge the three with espionage fearing the 
embarrassment of another spy controversy. 
  ASIO, closely modelled on Britain's MI5 domestic 
intelligence 
agency, has been wracked in recent months by revelations it was 
penetrated and compromised by foreign intelligence agencies. 
  The Australian intelligence operations are now the subject 
of 
two major inquiries after a series of embarrassing episodes in 
the last year, including the arrest of ASIO officer George Sadil 
and the expulsion of six Russian diplomats for alleged spying. 
  Sadil been committed to stand trial on 24 espionage charges. 
  ASIO's telecommunications and computer networks are said to 
have been replaced because they had been bugged by foreign 
intelligence and were no longer reliable. 
  Aldred has also asked Canberra to explain why former Soviet 
spy Valeriy Zemskov was allowed to enter Australia after it was 
informed he had been exposed to British intelligence by Soviet 
defector Oleg Gordievsky as a member of the elite KGB "special 
reserve." 
  "Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade push so 
hard for his entry and who were members of the influence network 
he built of senior Australian public servants?" Aldred asked in 
a parliamentary question Tuesday night. 
  "What is the government hiding?" 
  Aldred told AFP Wednesday that about 30 senior Australian 
public servants, ministerial staff and others were currently 
under investigation by one inquiry, because of associations with 
Zemskov and for other matters. 
  The latest three Canberra-based agents to be accused were 
former colleagues of Sadil and all had been co-operating with 
him, Aldred said. 
  It is believed concerns about their conduct were raised by a 
long-running undercover investigation by the Australian Federal 
Police codenamed Operation Liver. 
  In his question Aldred claimed Australia's intelligence 
community was "in a state of crisis". 
  He asked if the three had been forcibly retired by ASIO and 
if it was true the government wanted them to go quietly rather 
than take action against them. 
  He told AFP Wednesday three separate sources had confirmed 
his information which suggested the three, who translated highly 
sensitive material including intercepts, had been a serious 
threat to national security. 
  "The government apparently preferred that they just go 
quietly rather than have the embarrassment of charging further 
people, which would have made the whole system look like it was 
falling apart, which it probably is," he said. 
  A spokesman for attorney general Michael Lavarch, who has 
responsibility for intelligence matters, said he had no 
information about the claims and in any case it was unlikely he 
would be able to either confirm or deny the story.

  [Excerpt] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, says he's 
given a personal promise to Australia to carry out a review of 
Fiji's racially biased constitution. At talks in Canberra, 
Prime Minister Paul Keating urged Mr. Rabuka to keep up the 
momentum in favor of constitutional reform. Mr. Rabuka said he 
now believed he has earned the trust of Canberra. 
  [Begin Rabuka recording] The prime minister and the other 
ministers I spoke to this morning are greatly encouraged that we 
are moving ahead and I have given them my word that we are 
totally committed to the review. We understand that it's a very 
important issue. A lot of the problems, economic problems that 
we're now facing could be related to that and the sooner we can 
resolve the [words indistinct] the better it will be for 
everybody. [end recording] 
  Mr. Rabuka said native Fijians and Fiji's Indians would both 
have to make compromises on constitutional issues for the good 
of Fiji. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Australian customs officials have escorted into the 
northern port Darwin a vessel containing 51 suspected Chinese 
boat people. The motorized wooden boat was intercepted by 
customs boat off Australia's north coast. Immigration official 
said those on board who included 22 children had been taken to a 
detention center at Port Hedland in Western Australia for 
interviewing. They were all reported to be in good health. 
Official said the boat people appeared to be Cantonese speaking 
but it wasn't known where there were from.

  [Text] There are further signs that Australia's economy is 
continuing to improve. National accounts figures just released 
show annual economic growth now stands at 5 percent -- up from 4 
percent previously. Belinda Trump reports that the figures are 
likely to increase fear the economy cannot keep up the pace. 
  [Begin Trump recording] Gross Domestic Products rose by 1.9 
percent in the March quarter -- double some market expectations. 
The main contributions to growth were strong household and 
government spending, while business investment remained weak. 
  The March quarter was the eleventh consecutive quarter of 
growth, but where the economy goes from here is a major issue. 
Financial markets see the fast growth as a pointer to rising 
inflation down the track and fear the government may have to 
bring forward an increase in interest rates to control economic 
growth. 
  For the moment, though, the government has the best of both 
world -- fast growth with further signs in today's figures that 
inflation during the March quarter remained low. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says the big 
jump in economic growth confirms the Australian economy is on 
track for a sustained recovery. Mr. Willis says the strong 
growth marginally reflects the influence of a number of one-off 
factors, such as a big increase in public spending. 
  Treasurer says however, the complementary jump in private 
consumption, combined with rising profits, provides a highly 
favorable environment for increases in business investment. 
  The prime minister, Paul Keating says it is 30 years since 
the country has the economic conditions as good as this.

  [Text] The creation of new jobs in Australia's small 
business sector is expected to continue underpinning the 
nation's employment recovery. Adrian Thirsk reports that a 
survey by Yellow Pages Small Business shows as many as half of 
all new jobs in the past six months have been in enterprises 
with fewer than 20 workers. 
  [Begin recording] [Thirsk] The survey of 1,000 small 
businesses -- Australia's biggest such study -- indicates job 
creation among small businesses surged in the three months to 
April -- up 2.1 percent after just a 1 percent rise in the 
previous period. 
  Economic adviser for the index, Dr. John Marsdon, said 
business plans for the three months to July suggests a leveling 
off, but at a healthy peak. 
  [Marsdon] The expected employment growth has eased back from 
the previous quarter, but again is still strong and we have seen 
that strength on all indicators, including on profitability.

  [Text] Direct air links between Melbourne and Japan are 
set to be restored. State political reporter Tony Allen says it 
follows meetings between Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and 
Australia's international airline, Qantas. 
  [Begin recording] [Allen] Mr. Kennett declared a personal 
black ban on Qantas and Ansett international services to 
illustrate his concern at the airlines using Sydney as their 
base. Now, after talks with Mr. Kennett, Qantas has announced a 
plan for a weekly direct flight to Osaka's new Kansai Airport. 
  Mr. Kennett said it takes up an unused Ansett right that 
expires in November. 
  [Kennett] And we will support Qantas to get that flight 
awarded to Qantas. If that is the case, then we are able then 
to establish ourselves and to (?prove) up the value of that 
flight. [end recording] 
  As well, Qantas will add three new flights from Melbourne to 
Los Angeles via Auckland from the end of October. Qantas says 
it is more expensive to fly from Melbourne than from the Sydney 
and Queensland tourist markets, but if the new flights prove a 
success, there will be more.

  [Text] The United States Embassy in Fiji has come under 
fire for refusing to issue visas for 70 soccer fans who have 
already paid travel packages to attend the world cup in Los 
Angeles later this month. The Fiji Football Association, while 
expressing disgust at the Embassy's refusal, said it would take 
the matter up with the world soccer body, FIFA. The President 
of the Fiji Football Association (?Chadendra Majaraj) said the 
rejection was a bad reflection on the United States, which had 
sought Fiji's support to host the world cup. A spokesman for 
the American Embassy, Dennis (?Rowndes) said normal visitor 
rules were applied when applications were screened. He said some 
visas were approved while those which were not failed to show 
strong intentions of returning to Fiji once the world cup was 
over.

  [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, says he is 
grateful the Australian Government has joined Fiji in bilateral 
cooperation in the Southwest Pacific. He was speaking during a 
visit to Western Australia where he was attending a handing over 
ceremony near Fremantle of the newest Pacific patrol boat to the 
Fijian Defense Forces. The boat is the 17th built in Australia 
under a project involving 11 Pacific island nations. 
  Mr. Rabuka says the patrol boat program has a direct bearing 
on endeavors to strengthen Fiji's economic security, its fight 
against illicit drugs and contraband, and protection of its 
marine resources. The Fiji prime minister says the handing over 
of the boat is a significant event in the bilateral and 
cooperative approach that Australia and Fiji are adopting in 
developing their region. Mr. Rabuka says it also symbolizes a 
firm and abiding commitment by Canberra and Suva to continue to 
build on a strong friendship based on common and mutual 
interests in the South Pacific.

  [Text] The Fiji Parliament has passed the bill aimed at 
preventing possible terrorist attacks in Fiji aviation industry. 
The bill led by the tourism and aviation minister, Harold 
Powell, provides for life imprisonment as a maximum sentence for 
people convicted of hijacking, sabotaging, or endangering an 
aircraft. 
  Mr. Powell said the bill was important because it is in line 
with international aviation agreements and protocol. The laws 
would allow Fiji to be prepared to deal with crimes conducted in 
each aviation circuit and deter would-be fugitives wanted for 
aviation crime from taking refuge in Fiji. Mr. Powell said, 
under the new law, Fiji would have the legal grounds to force 
airlines using Fiji's airports to have a strict security system. 
Opposition leader Jairam Reddy said the bill was long overdue 
and he had no hesitation in supporting it.

  [Text] Tonga's offer to join a Pacific Islands 
peacekeeping force on the Papua New Guinea island of 
Bougainville will be followed up this week by a visit to the 
island by Tonga's minister for foreign affairs and defense, 
Crown Prince Tupouto'a. Sean Dorney reports that the crown 
prince will be the first minister of a foreign country to visit 
mainland Bougainville since the secessionist war began. 
  [Begin Dorney recording] Papua New Guinea's foreign 
minister, Sir Julius Chan, raised the possibility of Tonga 
providing the soldiers for the proposed peacekeeping force with 
Crown Prince Tupouto'a's father, the king, when in Tonga 
recently. The crown prince, who is a soldier himself, arrives 
in Port Moresby tomorrow for a five-day visit to Papua New 
Guinea. 
  Sir Julius says Price Tupouto'a will travel to Buka Island 
on 
Wednesday [8 June] and then go on to visit (Wakamayan Glowmahoe) 
on the Bougainville mainland. Fiji has also offered troops for 
the peacekeeping force, but Australia may be asked to fund.

  [Text] Port Moresby, June 6 (AFP) -- Papua New Guinea's 
opposition has lodged a no-confidence motion against Prime 
Minister Paias Wingti's ruling coalition. 
  Opposition leader Chris Haiveta said Sunday that 
parliamentary speaker Bill Skate was given notice of the the 
motion on Thursday. 
  The motion, which nominates Haiveta as prime minister, was 
filed by Bougainville MP John Momis and was signed by senior 
opposition MPs, including two former prime ministers, Sir 
Michael Somare and Rabbie Namaliu. 
  It was expected that it will be formally read out in the 
house by the parliament's clerk this week. Under parliamentary 
rules, the house can then wait seven days before taking a vote 
on the motion. 
  Haiveta said in a statement that a change of government was 
warranted because of what he described as mismanagement of the 
economy together with the undermining of PNG's traditionally 
good relations with neighbours and scandals among the leadership. 
  "Our cities are fast becoming the hell-holes of the South 
Pacific, their infrastructure collapsing, their people living in 
fear," Haiveta said. 
  Wingti, who seems to have a solid majority, has described 
the 
opposition move as unne@essary, labelling it "a cynical and 
destabilising grab for power." 
  "If they are serious about this vote, where are their 
alternate policies?" he said Sunday. 
  Wingti has the support of 70 of the 109 MPs in parliament. 
To 
get the motion through, the opposition needs at least a simple 
majority of 55 votes. 
  For the motion to go through, one of the four coalition 
parties would have to cross the floor when the vote is taken, 
observers said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will explore ways to improve U.S. access to Japan's auto markets 
in subcabinet-level talks starting in Tokyo on Friday [10 June]. 
  But it is uncertain whether or not they can bridge 
differences over "objective criteria" as the instrument for 
gauging Japanese auto and auto parts imports, the thorniest 
issue under the "framework" trade negotiations launched in July 
last year, government sources said Thursday. 
  The upcoming meeting will follow on from working-level auto 
trade talks in Washington last week, in which both parties 
agreed to put on hold the issue of how to set objective criteria. 
  Japan and the U.S. remain widely separated on the 
"quantitative" aspect of the objective criteria. 
  Washington is unlikely to seek Japan's commitment to promise 
a certain amount of auto and auto parts purchases in the future, 
the sources said. 
  But the U.S. may call for the inclusion in auto trade 
accords 
some indicators relating to future performances, such as the 
number of auto dealers in Japan handling U.S.-made cars, the 
sources said. 
  The sources said Japanese negotiators will respond only to 
indicators intended to gauge how Japan has done in the past. 
  The coming meeting will also address deregulatory measures, 
including simplification of safety checking procedures for 
imports and improvement of standards and certificates, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
semiconductor industry leaders agreed Thursday [9 June] to 
cooperate in promoting the use of personal computers in Japan as 
a means of increasing the U.S. share of Japan's chip market. 
  The accord was reached at an annual meeting held in Tokyo 
between the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) 
and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). 
  Japanese and U.S. industry leaders, however, remain apart 
over whether to include a 20 percent foreign market share goal 
in a new bilateral chip accord. 
  Hidehiko Yoshida, chairman of the EIAJ's Users' Committee of 
Foreign Semiconductors, told a news conference that the Japanese 
chip industry will disseminate the usefulness of personal 
computers by citing examples of popular use in the United States. 
  Both parties also agreed to a design-in promotion campaign, 
a 
mutual dispatch of trade missions and publicity of success 
stories in Japan involving U.S. chipmakers, said Yoshida, senior 
executive vice president of Toshiba Corp. 
  "Japanese semiconductor users continue to look forward to 
working with businessmen and engineers of foreign-owned 
companies in charting future cooperation between our highly 
competitive industries," Yoshida said. 
  Other Japanese chip industry officials said Japan and the 
U.S. have also agreed to cooperate in solving environmental 
issues involved in chip use and standardizing 
semiconductor-manufacturing equipment. 
  The U.S. demanded that the 20 percent foreign share goal in 
Japan's chip market be continued in a pact to replace the 
current one that expires in 1996. 
  The U.S. industry claimed such a goal can be a useful 
benchmark for measuring the openness of the Japanese market, the 
officials said. 
  But the EIAJ's Yoshida countered the argument, saying 
figures 
are not necessary if the Japanese side makes efforts to expand 
use of foreign chips.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The U.S. Government has 
extended an operation license for three Japanese airlines on six 
routes for 179 days until Dec. 5, the Transport Ministry said 
Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The license was due to expire Thursday. 
  The Japanese ministry also plans to extend similar license 
for five U.S. airlines on seven route until Oct. 29, ministry 
officials said. 
  This averted a total suspension of service by U.S. and 
Japanese airlines in the persistent aviation dispute arising 
from Washington's demand for expansion of rights to fly beyond 
Japan for American carriers. 
  The officials said the dispute remains unsettled because 
Japan still insists on restrictions on operations by U.S. 
airlines to third nations via Japan due to financial straits 
facing Japanese carriers. 
  The United States and Japan traded sanctions against 
respective airlines in March, cutting short their license 
periods.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A high-ranking U.S. 
Official will hold talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi 
Fukuda on Friday [10 June] to discuss political and security 
matters, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff, 
who arrived in Japan on Thursday, will discuss a wide range of 
diplomatic issues with Fukuda, the officials said. 
  Tarnoff's visit comes at a time when discussions are 
intensifying over ways to deal with North Korea's alleged 
development of nuclear weapons. 
  But the officials said the nuclear problem is not the only 
topic scheduled for discussion at the talks since the meeting is 
part of regular high-level bilateral consultations on political 
and security matters. 
  Tarnoff is expected to visit Seoul after the Tokyo trip. 
  Japan, the United States and South Korea agreed last weekend 
that the U.N. Security Council should "urgently" consider action 
against North Korea for its refusal to cooperate with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan will delete a phrase in 
an official statement that it does not regard the use of nuclear 
weapons as a violation of international law, Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa said Wednesday. 
  Kakizawa, taking back an earlier position, said the 
government will revise the statement to "the use of nuclear arms 
is not consistent with the spirit of humanitarianism existing at 
the basis of international law because of its power of 
destruction, killing and wounding." 
  Kakizawa made the comment at a session of the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee. 
  The ruling coalition on Monday endorsed the previous 
phrasing 
which was complied by the Foreign Ministry and was scheduled to 
be submitted to the International Court of Justice. 
  The government had maintained there were treaties banning 
the 
use of gas and chemical weapons but no treaty in existence 
banning the use of nuclear arms. 
  However, after the government's view was publicized on 
Monday, opposition parties and some cabinet ministers criticized 
the statement. 
  Management and Coordination Agency chief Koshiro Ishida said 
Tuesday, "It is regrettable to say the use of nuclear weapons 
does not violate international law." Environment Agency chief 
Toshiko Hamayotsu said the use of nuclear arms violates spirit 
of international law. Both Ishida and Hamayotsu belong to the 
Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]. 
  A-bomb victims in Nagasaki and Hiroshima also raised 
objection to the government's standing on the issue. 
  At Wednesday's session of the committee, legislators from 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party 
and Japanese Communist Party criticized the statement saying it 
is not proper for Japan, the sole country to have experienced 
the wrath of atomic bombs, to recognize the use of nuclear arms. 
  Japan maintains three antinuclear principles -- not to make, 
possess or harbor nuclear weapons on its territory. 
  The Hague-based international court called on nations 
concerned to submit a document on the issue after the World 
Health Organization (WHO) asked it in May to decide whether or 
not staging nuclear warfare violates international law.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Pyongyang warned Japan on 
Thursday [9 June] that it cannot avoid punishment if it joins in 
with sanctions against North Korea over the north's continued 
refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The North Korean Foreign Ministry, in a statement condemning 
Tokyo's "hostile policy" toward pro-Pyongyang Korean residents 
in Japan, reiterated that sanctions would be considered a 
declaration of war. 
  The statement was reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL 
NEWS AGENCY in a dispatch monitored in Tokyo. 
  "If Japan, failing to atone for the never-to-be-condoned 
crimes it had committed against the Korean people in the past, 
should join force in any sanctions against us, we would regard 
it as a declaration of war, and Japan would be unable to evade a 
deserving punishment for it," the statement said. 
  The statement condemned Monday's mistaken police raid on the 
offices of the Kyoto chapter of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) and a search of Chongryun 
offices in Osaka in April. 
  It charged that Japanese authorities are "taking advantage 
of 
U.S. attempts to isolate and stifle our republic over the 
nuclear issue" in order to suppress Chongryun and Koreans in 
Japan. 
  The statement also said Koreans "can hardly repress 
resentment" over the "immeasurable misfortunes and hardships" 
inflicted upon korea during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial period 
and that Japan "is still suppressing and persecuting Koreans in 
Japan." 
  Kyoto police searched Chongryun offices and its affiliate 
school on the mistaken assumption that the group had failed to 
submit a report, required under the national land utilization 
law, on the intended use of land acquired in 1990 and 1991. 
  City officials later discovered their oversight and 
apologized Tuesday. 
  In April, Osaka police searched Chongryun offices after a 
melee erupted during a demonstration by a rival group of Korean 
residents demanding the release of political prisoners in North 
Korea. 
  The protest was disrupted by men thought to be associated 
with Chongryun.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday North Korea's ability to resolve a dispute about 
its nuclear activities would improve its relations with other 
countries, and consequently with Japan. 
  Kazo Watanabe, director of the Social Democratic Party's [of 
Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] General Affairs Bureau, told reporters 
Hata's comments were made in a meeting with SDPJ officials who 
are scheduled to leave for North Korea on Friday. 
  Japan currently has no diplomatic relations with North 
Korea. 
Negotiations to normalize bilateral ties have been stalled since 
November 1992. 
  The SDPJ, the second largest opposition force, will send a 
three-member delegation headed by Watanabe to North Korea 
through Tuesday as part of efforts to promote ties with the 
(North) Korean Workers Party. 
  Hata did not ask the SDPJ officials to hand a personal 
letter 
or message to North Korean leaders, according to Watanabe. 
  A group of legislators of the primary opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party is also scheduled to visit North Korea later 
next week. 
  Hata expressed hope North Korea will keep channels open with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) whose inspectors 
have been denied full access to nuclear facilities, Watanabe 
said. 
  In the event of Pyonyang's clearing the suspicions of its 
covert nuclear weapons development, Japan will consider 
extending multinational assistance to North Korea in cooperation 
with other countries, Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Hata also said Tokyo wishes to get along well with Pyongyang 
because Japan and North Korea are two neighboring countries in 
Asia.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday the tension over North Korea's refusal of 
international inspections at its nuclear reactor is in a "very 
severe" state, expressing deepening concerns about the 
deteriorating dispute. 
  Hata told a session of the House of Councillors Budget 
Committee that global apprehension is rising because of North 
Korea's failure to respond to the international call for a full 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  "Japan should make the proper, possible response, keeping in 
step with the international community. The current state is 
very severe," he said. 
  North Korea has been recalcitrant in its refusal of 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at 
the nuclear complex at Yongbyon to determine if nuclear fuel has 
been diverted to make atomic bombs. 
  Hata said Japan should play an active role in solving the 
issue. 
  At the committee session, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
said 
Japan will continue to seek a peaceful solution. 
  Frustrated by North Korea's stubborn stance, the United 
States is now seeking sanctions against the country, either by 
the UN Security Council, or if such a move is thwarted by a 
China veto, in coordination with its allies like Japan and South 
Korea. 
  "North Korea seems to have no intention to resort to a 
military counterattack (against sanctions)," Kakizawa said. 
  "It is important to try to persuade North Korea to change 
its 
stance...While avoiding any provocative language," he added. 
  Kakizawa also said he will try to talk China into toeing the 
international line on the issue during his forthcoming visit to 
Beijing. 
  "I hope for joint action with China's participation," he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
believes Japan should weigh the possibility of slapping 
sanctions against North Korea as part of efforts to talk the 
communist state into fully disclosing its suspected nuclear 
program. 
  The premier, in an interview printed in the Thursday morning 
edition of South Korean's daily TONG-A ILBO, repeated Tokyo's 
position of seeking a peaceful resolution on the issue through 
dialogue. Hata also made clear that in response to North Korea's 
alleged push for nuclear arms, Japan will take "responsible" 
action within the bounds of the constitution, which bans the use 
of force in settling international disputes. 
  Noting Tokyo wants to forge future-oriented ties with 
countries in the Asia-Pacific region based on repentance of its 
wartime wrongdoings, Hata said the Japanese Government is 
contemplating how to express remorse toward South Korea. 
  Historians say around World War II, Japan sent to 
battlefront 
brothels an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 women, mostly from the 
Korean peninsula, then under Japanese colonial rule. 
  Because Japan and South Korea are neighboring countries with 
common values of freedom and democracy, Hata said, Japan will 
strive to promote exchanges at all levels, deepen mutual 
understanding and step up bilateral cooperation in the 
international community.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam agreed Thursday [9 Jun] 
to keep in close contact on the problem of North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Hata and Kim reaffirmed the need for close consultations on 
the nuclear issue in a 25-minute telephone conversation, the 
officials said. 
  Kim, who has just returned from a weeklong visit to Russia 
and Uzbekistan, called Hata to brief him about the trip. 
  Saying he had agreed with Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 
keep in close contact on the North Korean nuclear problem, Kim 
stressed the important of cooperation among Japan, South Korea 
and the United States as well as with Russia and China on the 
problem, according to the officials. 
  Kim told Hata that U.S. President Bill Clinton also phoned 
Kim while he was in Moscow, they said. 
  Hata told Kim he hopes Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will be able to 
discuss the matter when Kakizawa visits Seoul on Saturday, the 
officials said. 
  The premier said it is important that Pyongyang cooperate 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as soon as 
possible and sweep away international concern that it is 
developing nuclear weapons. 
  Later in the day, Kakizawa and South Korean Ambassador to 
Japan Kong No-myong agreed in a meeting that Japan, South Korea 
and the U.S. acknowledge that China's role is important in 
solving the problem, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa said he wants to discuss the nuclear issue with Han 
based on the results of last weekend's consultations among 
Japan, South Korea and the U.S. in Washington. 
  He also said he wants to discuss bilateral and international 
affairs when they meet in Seoul. 
  Kong told Kakizawa that the South Korean Government has not 
changed its stance on the problem but has recently begun to 
express its position more clearly than before. 
  He was quoted as saying Seoul decided to do so because of 
criticism that its stance on the nuclear issue was one of 
appeasing North Korea.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 KYODO -- Two hours of talks between 
the foreign ministers of China and South Korea failed to make 
any headway Thursday on the issue of a suspected North Korean 
nuclear weapons program, a diplomatic source in Beijing said. 
  Han Sung-chu, South Korean foreign minister, explained to 
his 
Chinese counterpart the various consultations among the United 
States, Russia, Britain and Japan, and said U.N. Security 
Council sanctions against North Korea were "inevitable," a South 
Korean diplomat said. 
  Han, who arrived in Beijing late Wednesday directly from the 
United Nations, told Qian Qichen the role of China in this 
matter was "very important" and urged China to "cooperate 
positively," he said. 
  Qian said China and South Korea share the same view 
concerning the seriousness of the current situation and the 
Chinese Government firmly maintains the basic position that 
there should be no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, he 
said. 
  China urged continued dialogue among the four parties 
concerned and said it would make the utmost efforts and "do its 
best" to closely consult with the authorities concerned, 
including the members of the security council, the Beijing-based 
diplomat said. 
  Qian did not elaborate on China's position on sanctions 
against North Korea, nor did he indicate whether or not China 
would veto such sanctions if the security council votes for 
them, he said. 
  The Chinese foreign minister, however, called for the 
strengthening of consultations between China and South Korea, he 
said. 
  The diplomat interpreted the remarks of the Chinese foreign 
minister as an indication of China's unwillingness to 
participate in the implementation of sanctions on North Korea. 
  It was not clear if the Chinese side urged Han to encourage 
the U.S. to engage in a third round of talks with North Korea. 
  Consultations among Security Council members have taken 
place 
since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to 
the U.N. last Friday the impossibility of determining whether 
North Korea diverted to military use plutonium from spent fuel 
rods at their 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor. 
  Such an incident, if it did occur, would be a violation of 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and could be reason enough 
to implement U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- The request of the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) for views on the legality 
of the use of nuclear weapons has driven Japan, the only nation 
to have suffered atomic bombings, into a difficult corner. 
  The Japanese Government initially planned to offer a purely 
legalistic view to the ICJ that the use of nuclear weapons does 
not violate international law. 
  But the government was forced to drop the idea after the 
revealed plan prompted a backlash of criticism. 
  "I think this case showed how the Japanese people have an 
aversion to nuclear weapons and how strong their antinuclear 
feelings are," a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Antinuclear groups and atomic bomb sufferers reacted with 
shock and disbelief to news that Japan intended to say in a 
document to the ICJ that although the use of nuclear weapons is 
unacceptable from a humanitarian point of view, it does not 
violate international law. 
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the U.S. dropped atom bombs in 
1945, strongly objected to the planned statement, and urged 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
to change the wording of the report and denounce the use of 
nuclear arms as a violation of international law. 
  Politicians from opposition parties as well as cabinet 
ministers within the ruling coalition also voiced their concern 
about it, prompting a further stall in Diet deliberations on the 
much-delayed budget. 
  The dispute was further aggravated by the timing, since the 
standoff regarding North Korea's alleged development of nuclear 
weapons is at a highly sensitive stage with the possibility of 
U.N. sanctions looming. 
  "It's unbelievable," said lawyer Masanori Ikeda, a member of 
the World Court Project Japan Center, about the original report 
planned for submission. The center is composed of lawyers and 
victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
  "If you say the use of nuclear weapons is not illegal, that 
means countries can possess and use them without being 
punished," Ikeda said. "Tell that to North Korea and it will be 
delighted." 
  Japan's stance contradicts its position to support possible 
U.N. sanctions against North Korea, he added. 
  "The international community considers Japan's nuclear 
policy 
to be very authoritative because it is the only nation 
experiencing atomic bombing. But if Japan says the use of 
nuclear weapons is not illegal, it will certainly be extremely 
shocking to the world," he said. 
  The Japanese Government received a request from the ICJ, 
based in The Hague in the Netherlands, last September to submit 
by June 10 a written statement on whether it thinks the use of 
nuclear arms is illegal. 
  The ICJ made the request to all U.N. member countries after 
the World Health Organization (WHO) asked the court in May 1993 
to offer an "advisory opinion" on whether the use of nuclear 
arms violates international law from the standpoint of its 
impact on health and the environment. 
  The contents of the statements will not be disclosed until 
the International Court compiles a report based on statements 
submitted by all U.N. member countries. 
  But according to the gist of the initial statement revealed 
by Foreign Ministry officials, Japan was to reiterate its 
traditional stance that "judging purely from the standpoint of 
international law ... the international community has not yet 
reached a consensus that the use of nuclear weapons violates 
present international law." 
  The government has been taking such a position since the 
1960s, according to the ministry. 
  The ministry, which is in charge of preparing the statement, 
tried to ward off criticism by saying the ICJ request was for a 
"legal interpretation" of the use of nuclear weapons. 
  "Unfortunately, there is no international law that bans the 
use of nuclear weapons," said a senior ministry official, adding 
that Japan's opposition to nuclear weapons is clear in the 
statement because it includes passages stating nuclear weapons 
should never be used and others referring to Japan's three-point 
nonnuclear policy. 
  Japan has claimed to adhere to a policy of not producing, 
possessing or allowing nuclear weapons into Japan since it was 
approved by the Diet in 1968. 
  After much bickering in the press and in the Diet, however, 
the ministry decided to delete the passage about the legality of 
the use of nuclear weapons. 
  Instead, the Japanese statement will stress that 
"considering 
its tremendous power to destroy, kill and injure, the use of 
nuclear arms is not consistent with the spirit of 
humanitarianism that exists at the basis of thought in 
international law," according to ministry officials. 
  "The government decided to avoid specifying its legal 
position in the statement considering the opinions within and 
outside of the Diet," said a high-ranking ministry official. 
"Instead the Japanese Government decided to express its 
political position on the matter." 
  The official pointed out that it does not mean the Japanese 
Government's legal interpretation of nuclear arms has changed. 
  Submitting the written statement to the ICJ is not 
compulsory, but the official said the option of abstaining from 
presenting the paper was ruled out from the beginning. 
  "As a major U.N. member, and as a country which is deeply 
involved in nuclear problems, it would be extremely unnatural 
for Japan not to submit the statement," he said.

  [Text] New York, June 8 KYODO -- Japan renewed its bid 
Wednesday [8 Jun] to become a permanent member of a revised UN 
Security Council and pledged its support to the reform of the 
United Nations. 
  UN Ambassador Hisashi Owada told a working group that Japan 
intends to work actively for reform of the UN and based on the 
philosophy of reform, will "do all it can to discharge its 
responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council 
in the cause of world peace and stability." 
  Owada made the remarks in a closed-door session of the 
working group, which is drafting reform proposals in response to 
the increasing scope and importance of the role of the UN in the 
post- Cold War era. 
  It was the first time for Japan to clearly state its wish to 
become a permanent member of the Security Council before a UN 
body. 
  The council now groups five permanent members, Britain, 
China, France, Russia and the United States, which are the major 
victor nations of World War II, and 10 nonpermanent members 
selected from U.N. member nations for two-year terms. 
  Pointing to Japan's "active" participation in UN-led 
peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, Owada said many members of 
the UN General Assembly and the working group fully recognize 
Japan's bid for a permanent seat on an enlarged council. 
  He expressed support for the working group's intermediary 
report which proposed an increase in the 15-member council to 
20-25 seats. 
  While advocating a limited increase in permanent members, 
Owada said under-represented Asia, Africa and Latin America must 
be allocated more nonpermanent seats. 
  The working group is expected to issue its final report on 
the restructuring and strengthening of the UN and the Security 
Council in September.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- During the latest 
ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD), no new request was made to Japan for 
quickening its economic recovery, a senior Japanese trade 
official said Thursday [9 Jun]. 
  A joint communique referring to fiscal and monetary measures 
signals "strong expectations" by OECD member countries, 
especially the United States, for early economic recovery in 
Japan and Europe, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and 
industry minister, told a press conference. 
  But that does not mean they must do something specific, 
Kumano said. 
  The communique issued Wednesday at the end the two-day Paris 
gathering said, "where recovery is not yet sustained, eased 
monetary policy should be maintained...Where possible, 
consistent with the medium-term policy objective of budget 
consolidation, fiscal measures will be implemented as necessary 
to ensure sustained noninflationary growth led by strong 
domestic demand." 
  The wording shows the "well-balanced position" of the OECD, 
Kumano said. But he did not elaborate. 
  During the ministerial discussion, the U.S. has reportedly 
pressed for stronger wording to be used regarding requests to 
Japan and Europe.

  [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- Japan and Russia reaffirmed 
Wednesday [8 June] cooperation in developing bilateral relations 
and continued negotiations for a settlement of the long-standing 
territorial dispute, Japanese officials said. 
  The agreement was reached in a meeting between Nobuo 
Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for external 
affairs, and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, the 
officials said. 
  Matsunaga and Kozyrev are in Paris to attend a ministerial 
meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD). 
  The officials said Matsunaga and Kozyrev also agreed the 
countries will coordinate efforts to solve a crisis arising from 
suspected nuclear weapons development by North Korea. 
  Matsunaga told Kozyrev that political and economic dialogue 
has progressed since Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited 
Japan last October. 
  He stressed the need for further development of bilateral 
relations under the Tokyo declarations issued during Yeltsin's 
visit, including negotiations for a settlement of the 
territorial dispute in accordance with law and justice, the 
officials said. 
  Kozyrev agreed with Matsunaga's view and expressed hope that 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Russia. 
  Matsunaga withheld an immediate response, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A Russian joint venture with 
Japanese international telecommunications giant KDD will start 
international telephone services with prepaid telephone cards in 
the Russian Far East in August, KDD said Thursday [9 June]. 
  KDD and Japanese trading house Nissho Iwai Corp set up the 
Vladivostok-based joint venture Vostoktelecom Co. in 1992 with 
Interdaltelecom, a telecommunications service company in the 
Russian Far East. 
  Telephone cards worth 20 dollars and 50 dollars will be 
issued for the telephone service, to be available in 
Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and four other cities in the region, KDD 
said. 
  Fifteen card-based telephones will be installed at hotels, 
railway stations and airports, KDD said. 
  The service is intended mostly for Japanese businessmen and 
travelers in the region.

  [Text] Tokyo, 7 Jun (EFE) -- According to Japanese Foreign 
Ministry sources, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori reiterated 
his country's desire to join the Asian Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC). 
  Fujimori, who is on the second day of his private visit, 
expressed this desire during a dinner given in his honor by 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Hata explained to Fujimori that the APEC decided last 
November to freeze accepting new members for three years. He 
also said that the Japanese proposal to the other APEC members 
to allow Peru to attend its working meeting did not receive a 
consensus. 
  Fujimori plans to meet Emperor Akihito and visit the NEC 
electronics factory in Yokohama, near Tokyo, today.

  [Text] Tokyo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori today ended his three-day visit to Japan with the hope 
that Peru's economic and political stabilization will help get 
more aid for development, investment, and tourism in his country. 
  Before leaving for Beijing, Fujimori told EFE he was 
satisfied with the result of his visit, while Council of 
Ministers President Efrain Goldenberg added that "the Japanese 
officials are gradually getting more enthusiastic" in their 
economic relations with Peru. 
  Upon arriving in Tokyo, Fujimori said the trip's top 
objective was to inform the Japanese Government and private 
business about Peruvian economic reforms and the pacification 
program in order to expedite aid for development and attract 
private investors. 
  Peru did not get any donation or credit this time but 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was willing to help Peru 
with three projects: a drinking water treatment and sewer 
system for Lima, improvement of the Callao port infrastructure, 
and irrigation with Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) 
financing. 
  Regarding an Eximbank credit for Peru for a hydroelectric 
project, Hata told Fujimori on 6 June that the project depends 
on sending a mission to Peru to study its cost and feasibility. 
  According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry source, Japan is 
considering donations of food and hospital equipment to Peru. No 
details of concrete projects were disclosed until the requests 
are made through diplomatic channels. 
  Fujimori insisted to Hata that Japan support Peru to join 
the 
Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), although new 
memberships have been frozen. 
  Fujimori's agenda, which was much lighter than other times, 
included an audience with Emperor Akihito, a meeting with 120 
Tokyo Chamber of Commerce businessmen, meetings with top 
Eximbank and OECF executives, and a visit to the multinational 
electronic NEC Corporation plant in Yokohama to request 
technological cooperation on telecommunications. 
  At the end of his stay in Tokyo, Fujimori was given an 
"honorary degree" by the University of Keio in recognition of 
his work for Peruvian development and stability. 
  At the cultural level, President Fujimori dedicated a 
traveling exhibition in Japan about the Shikan culture sponsored 
by the private television network Tokyo Broadcasting Systems 
(TBS) and another exhibition on Inca art at the University of 
Tokyo. 
  Negotiations for the payment of the Peruvian debt to Japan, 
pending since Tokyo accepted its renegotiation with the Paris 
Club in 1993, have not been resumed. 
  During his visit Fujimori wanted to promote the image of "a 
Peru in peace" and in rapid economic growth to attract not only 
capital and trade but also restore tourism in Peru's historic 
areas.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Takehiko Kajita: "Hata Under Constant No- </F>
Confidence Threat From Here On"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
is skating on thin ice as head of a precarious minority 
government in the face of strident demands from a mighty 
opposition camp for the mass resignation of the cabinet or a 
snap general election. 
  With the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget passed 
through the decisive House of Representatives on Wednesday, the 
focus of attention has shifted to whether the Hata 
administration can survive after the budget legislation becomes 
law. 
  The once-dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has already 
given public notice that it intends to file a no-confidence 
motion against the Hata cabinet once the budget is enacted, in a 
move to wrest back power after nearly a year in the opposition 
bleachers. 
  "The continued existence of this cabinet is not beneficial 
to 
Japan," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori asserted Tuesday. 
"It would result in a deepening of the current political chaos." 
  As the governing coalition lacks a majority in the 511-seat 
lower house, it is within the LDP's power to topple the present 
government in a no-confidence vote -- unless the second-largest 
opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan], 
moves to obstruct the effort. 
  The SDP, the largest force in the previous administration of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, walked out of the coalition in 
April, leaving Hata with Japan's first minority government in 39 
years and fanning speculation that his cabinet would collapse as 
soon as the budget was adopted. 
  Even so, it is unclear whether the SDP will automatically 
join forces with the LDP to bring down the six-week-old 
government. 
  If a no-confidence motion is indeed rammed through the Diet, 
Hata will be torn between two harsh choices -- resigning or 
dissolving the lower house for a snap general poll. 
  A mass resignation of the cabinet would open the way for the 
LDP's return to power, an idea the SDP can hardly feel 
comfortable with. 
  As the main opposition party during the LDP's 38-year 
unbroken rule that ended last August, the SDP well knows that 
while it can work with the LDP to force Hata from office, it 
cannot cooperate in governing due to wide policy differences. 
  On the other hand, if the premier were to call a general 
election on his own initiative, a feud would be triggered within 
the SDP over any concerted action with the LDP to overturn the 
Hata administration. 
  Dozens of SDP lawmakers say that an election under the 
current multiseat system would be tantamount to the demise of 
political reform, as the Diet has already legislated a set of 
electoral reform bills introducing a mixture of single-seat 
voting districts and proportional representation for lower house 
polls. 
  Masao Sakon, a reform-minded SDP rank-and-filer, warned that 
he and others within the SDP may have to quit the party if the 
leadership moves to cooperate with the LDP in defeating the Hata 
government through a no-confidence vote. 
  "If such a situation arises, we may have to make a certain 
decision," he said. 
  Nor is the LDP monolithic. 
  As the nation's years of efforts to achieve anticorruption 
political reform will not be capped without the enactment of a 
yet-to-be-formulated bill drawing a new electoral map, 
pro-reformers within the LDP have also been against a general 
election under the moribund old system. 
  "I think a no-confidence motion will ultimately not be 
submitted," a senior coalition official said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  Hata, a veteran politician and staunch advocate of political 
reform, for his part has underscored the need to contest the 
next lower house election under a revamped system that goes into 
force only after the redistricting bill is acted upon. 
  The chief executive has so far shown no interest in SDP 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo's proposal for quitting on a 
voluntary basis after passage of the budget and before a 
no-confidence vote so as to fashion a new coalition government, 
possibly with the participation of the SDP. 
  "If the voluntary resignation proposal was offered with an 
eye to returning to the coalition, the motive was impure," said 
Yoshiaki Iisaka, professor of political science at Tokyo's 
Gakushuin University. 
  It is almost impossible to make a fresh start even if the 
SDP 
returns to the coalition, because the party once opted to leave 
the ruling alliance, Iisaka predicted. 
  In any case, it is certain that between now and the June 29 
close of the current ordinary Diet session, Hata's fragile 
administration will face intensifying attacks from the 
opposition forces. 
  "This Diet session will wind up without an extension and the 
current state of political flux will likely drag on until 
September," said another senior coalition official who requested 
he not be identified.

  [Text] Osaka, June 4 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, chief 
strategist in the ruling coalition, called Saturday [4 June] for 
policy consultations with the the opposition Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], a former coalition partner. 
  "Both ruling and opposition parties must consider how they 
will act after parliamentary debate on the state budget (for 
fiscal 1994) ends," Ozawa, secretary general of shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], said in a speech. 
  The withdrawal in late April of the SDP, the largest 
component in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, forced Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first 
minority government in 39 years. 
  The SDP walked out of the coalition following the abrupt 
formation of a new parliamentary group by other coalition 
partners excluding the SDP. 
  The SDP has demanded that the Hata cabinet voluntarily 
resign 
en masse after passage of the budget through the Diet. The 
overdue budget is expected to clear the Diet in mid-June. 
  The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party is poised to 
submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet. 
  If the SDP supports the motion, Hata has to disband his 
cabinet or dissolve the House of Representatives. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo predicted Saturday the 
Hata 
cabinet will resign en masse if such a motion against his 
cabinet is approved. 
  "If a no-confidence motion is approved, the Hata cabinet 
will 
have no other choice but to resign en masse," Kubo told 
reporters in Hachinohe in Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- A friendship promotion 
association led by Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist of the 
ruling coalition which reportedly received 100 million yen from 
the construction industry in 1991, also received donations from 
other industries totaling 560 million yen, association sources 
said Friday [3 June]. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
reportedly used his influence to secure contributions from 
automotive, electronics, banking and other industries for the 
"John Manjiro no kai," a nonprofit group to promote Japan-U.S. 
grassroots relations, the sources said. 
  The friendship organization was established in November 
1990, 
when Ozawa was then secretary general of the Liberal Democratic 
Party and sought donations from businesses to host a November 
1991 conference in Kyoto to promote Japan-U.S. exchanges. 
  Sadao Hirano, a Shinseito member of the House of 
Councillors, 
a close associate of Ozawa, was the acting chairman of the 
organization and reportedly asked the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) in September 1991 for its assistance 
in reaching a donations goal of 600 million yen. 
  Hirano said Keidanren Secretary General Masaya Miyoshi spoke 
with the industries that could not contribute money through 
Keidanren, calling him "very cooperative." 
  On Thursday, the sources said the "John Manjiro no kai" 
received 100 million yen from the Japan Federation of 
Construction Contractors (Nikkenren), which is an influential 
group in the Keidanren. 
  John Manjiro was a fisherman from old Tosa Province who was 
shipwrecked in 1841 and taken to the United States by an 
American whaling ship. 
  Manjiro later returned to Japan where he served as a 
translator, wrote an English phrase book and taught at the 
predecessor of Tokyo University as Japan opened to the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- A subcommittee of the ruling 
coalition's tax reform panel came up with a report Wednesday [8 
June] calling for administrative and fiscal reforms as a 
precondition for a raise in indirect taxes, officials said. 
  The officials said the report focuses on reorganization of 
92 
government-backed corporations and administrative reforms of 
local governments. 
  The document did not name those corporations to be abolished 
or consolidated, they said. 
  The officials said the report stressed the need for the 
government to push ahead with reform measures at both central 
and local administration levels to line up public support for 
tax reforms -- specifically a hike in the consumption tax rate 
which now stands at 3.0 percent. 
  The panel laid down five principles for a thorough review of 
government-backed corporations within fiscal 1994 to map out a 
reorganization plan in the early part of fiscal 1995, the 
officials said. 
  The principles call for corporations that have attained 
their 
goals to be abolished or scaled down and for those which are 
unproductive to be reorganized, they said. 
  The report stopped short of proposing consolidation of six 
ministries and agencies, including the Construction, Transport 
and Agriculture Ministries and three agencies, saying simply 
that the government should take a positive step on the matter, 
the officials said. 
  The report called for restructuring of local governments to 
reduce personnel and promote efficiency, they said.

<F P=106> [REUTER/YONHAP from Kiev and Istanbul] </F>
  [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said on 8 
June that North Korea will allow the inspections of nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] if the United States consents to resume talks with it. 
  Regarding the North Korean proposal that it allow nuclear 
inspections conditional on North Korean-U.S. talks, U.S. State 
Department Spokesman Mike McCurry, said: "Further study of 
North Korea's new proposal is needed since it hinted on 
flexibility in resolving the nuclear conflict." By saying so, 
he did not reject the possibility of holding new dialogue with 
North Korea. 
  In a news conference following his visit to the Ukraine, 
North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said: "If North 
Korean-U.S. talks are resumed, we will guarantee the inspection 
of North Korean nuclear facilities by testing, measuring, and 
preserving nuclear fuel rods there." 
  Minister Kim Yong-nam said: "The United States and North 
Korea are the parties directly concerned with the current 
situation regarding the nuclear issue, and only the two can 
resolve the issue." He then said that "the nuclear issue was 
created by the United States, and threats against North Korea 
also come from the Untied States," and denounced the United 
States for refusing the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks 
by using delay tactics. 
  He stressed that the United States and some circles of the 
IAEA continue to organizationally slander, defame, and attack 
North Korea for political purposes. 
  In the meantime, Spokesman McCurry, who is currently 
accompanying U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 
Istanbul, said in his commentary on DPRK Minister Kim Yong-nam's 
proposal that day, that "the proposal may imply a some degree of 
North Korean flexibility," and stressed: "In consideration of 
the U.S. need for a guarantee that North Korea will stay in the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, further review of North Korea's 
proposal is needed [migugurosonun pukhani haekhwaksan choyage 
kyesok namaiddanun pojangul piryoro handanun kyonjieso igatun 
cheuirul toisang pyonggahal piryoga idda]." 
  Spokesman McCurry added: "It is certainly important for the 
IAEA to be authorized to conduct nuclear inspections in North 
Korea." 
  Regarding this, U.S. officials concerned roused public 
attention not to react excessively to recent announcements by 
North Korea over the nuclear issue. U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher who arrived in Istanbul on 8 June to attend 
the NATO foreign ministers' meeting also said that he was not 
taking all the announcements reported from North Korea at their 
face value.

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
called Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata Thursday morning to 
consult on the North Korean nuclear situation and explain the 
results of his Russian visit. 
  Kim called Hata at 9 AM and emphasized that UN sanctions 
against North Korea are inevitable if it chooses to go ahead 
with its nuclear weapons program, aides said. Reiterating that 
Pyongyang's nuclear program must be stopped, the president 
sought Japanese cooperation, they said. 
  Kim briefed the Japanese leader on his telephone 
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton in which they 
emphasized tripartite efforts by Seoul, Tokyo and Washington on 
sanctions. 
  Hata responded that Japan acknowledges U.N. sanctions are 
unavoidable due to North Korea's attitude and the current 
international situation, although it is Tokyo's basic stance to 
try and solve the nuclear problem through dialogue. 
  The prime minister promised the closest cooperation allowed 
under the Japanese Constitution on the sanctions in 
consultations among Japan, South Korea and the United States, 
Kim's spokesman Chu Ton- sik said. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa is due in Seoul this 
Saturday, and Kim said he will have his Foreign Minister Han 
Sung- chu explain to Kakizawa China's stance on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Han returns later Thursday from Beijing, where he held talks 
with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. 
  Hata said he will have Kakizawa call on President Kim to 
discuss many issues. 
  Kim is expected to call President Clinton soon to brief him 
on his Russian visit and to consult again on the North Korean 
nuclear situation.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of a written interview with Japanese Prime </F>
Minister Tsutomu Hata by TONG-A ILBO reporter Pae In-chun on 8 
June] 
  [Text] [Pae In-chun] In relation to Japan's security 
policy, what changes have there been in the interpretation of 
the so-called peace constitution? 
  [Tsutomu Hata] I have no intention of changing the present 
constitutional interpretation of security policy. Regarding the 
issue of collective right to self defense, for example, as long 
as Japan is a sovereign state, it is reasonable for Japan to 
have the collective right to self-defense according to 
international law. However, exercising the right to self defense 
as stipulated in Article 9 of the constitution (giving up war, 
not bearing arms, and rescinding the right to aggression) must 
be carried out within the limits of at least defending Japan. 
Since exercising collective self-defense exceeds this limit, 
the government thus concluded that from the standpoint of the 
constitution, it was not allowed. 
  [Pae] What is Japan's basic position on its international 
role? 
  [Hata] Currently, Japan has emerged as a country exercising 
great influence in international society. To establish a new 
peace order, it is inevitable for Japan to carry out its role 
and responsibilities commensurate with it. From this point of 
view, I feel that Japan must carry out various international 
contributions such as making efforts to solve environmental 
issues, resolving regional disputes, managing arms, promoting 
disarmament, and taking part in UN peacekeeping activities. 
Furthermore, we must also carry out sufficient organizational 
work to successfully accomplish these works. 
  [Pae] What is the basic position of Japan's diplomacy toward 
the ROK? 
  [Hata] Promoting friendly relations with the ROK is one of 
the most important pillars of Japan's diplomatic policy. To 
further develop ROK-Japan relations under this kind of 
understanding, I believe that it is important to establish a 
future-oriented relationship by facing the facts of history. To 
achieve this, exchange among figures from various circles of 
both countries must be promoted so as to enhance mutual 
understanding and promote cooperation in the international 
society. 
  [Pae] How do you plan on concluding the issues related to 
our past? 
  [Hata] We must newly recognize that our country's past act 
of aggression and colonial rule brought about great suffering 
and unhappiness to the people and convey this to our next 
generations. We must deeply reflect on the past, and I hope that 
based on this, we will be able to create peace and build a 
bright future in the Asia-Pacific region. The issue concerning 
the right to claim assets between our peoples and countries was 
completely and ultimately resolved through the economic 
cooperation agreement on the right to claims. However, in 
consideration of the character of the issue, the comfort women 
issue is currently being examined for achieving the quickest 
solution to this issue. 
  [Pae] What is Japan's position regarding U.S.-Japan 
relations? 
  [Hata] U.S.-Japan relations are most important for both 
countries. The two countries have played a core role in 
securing peace and prosperity in the world since the end of the 
Cold War. From the political and security point of view, we will 
continue to adhere to the U.S.-Japan security treaty based on 
the U.S.-Japan allied relationship and make further efforts to 
operate it more smoothly. In coordinating various important 
diplomatic issues including the issue of developing nuclear 
weapons by North Korea, and issues in the Asia-Pacific region, 
we will work to closely exchange views. We will carry out 
courageous economic reform with sovereignty in expanding the 
opening of the market and significantly curtailing the current 
account surplus.

<F P=106> [Speech by ROK President Kim Yong-sam upon arrival from his </F>
official visit to Russia and Uzbekistan at Seoul Airport in 
Seoul on 7 June--live] 
  [Text] My dear fellow countrymen: I have returned home, 
winding up my one-week visit to Russia and Uzbekistan. 
  Through the visit, I have opened a new historic horizon for 
ROK-Russian cooperation. Ending the era of conflict and dispute 
between them, the two countries have built a firm foundation for 
mutually complementary partnership relations. 
  Russian President Yeltsin promised to suspend [chungdan] 
selling arms to North Korea and said that Russia will in fact 
scrap the mutual assistance treaty [sangho wonjo choyaktto 
sasilsang pegihagettago hangosun]. This will contribute to 
establishing a new basis for our security. 
  Russia promised resolute measures, such as joining 
international sanctions, when necessary, to stop the North 
Korean nuclear program. Russia delivered to us data concerning 
the Korean War. This means that the Cold War past between the 
ROK and Russia has been completely liquidated. 
  That I have visited the Russian Pacific fleet as ROK 
president symbolizes that the two countries are closely 
cooperating in security as well. 
  These are epoch-making events that were hardly imaginable a 
few years ago. 
  Our two countries have agreed to open a new era of common 
prosperity. Based on the agreements of cooperation of various 
types signed during my visit, the two countries can now carry on 
practical economic cooperation and technological cooperation. 
  With my visit to Russia, I have completed the visits to four 
countries, namely, the United States, Japan, China, and Russia. 
I have completed the framework of the rectangular diplomacy to 
bring forth peace in Northeast Asia, to establish a new world 
order, and to promote our national interest. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: That we have promoted friendship 
and cooperation with Uzbekistan during my visit also has a very 
important significance. Uzbekistan has been carrying out the 
most steady reform among the CIS countries. Uzbekistan not only 
has abundant natural resources, such as gold and cotton, but has 
a great potential for development. 
  Uzbek President Karimov proposed active economic cooperation 
with our country. President Karimov assured me that a legal and 
systematic foundation will be laid so as to promote our 
businesses' advance into the Uzbek market. Large-scale joint 
investment has already been undertaken between the businesses of 
the two countries. I expect that Uzbekistan will in time play a 
role of our forward base for the Central Asian region. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: I met our beloved brethren in 
Russia and Uzbekistan. They were pioneering life with vigorous 
power vitality. Despite the history of hardship they suffered, 
they preserved well the Korean tradition and culture. With 
diligence and sincerity characteristic of our nation, they were 
enjoying a high reputation. They were proud of their 
fatherland's development. I was deeply moved by their positive 
life. 
  I was assured of ample consideration by the governments of 
the two countries so that our compatriots may not suffer 
disadvantages as a minority. 
  I visited Vladivostok on my way home. Vladivostok is closely 
connected with us historically as a base for our independence 
movement. It is a region whose importance is highlighted for 
our economic advance into Siberia. I visited the Russian 
Pacific Fleet there, and had a historic opportunity to look over 
the Korean peninsula from there. 
  It took no less than half a century to go there, 
Vladivostok, 
which is close to the Tumen River. I have returned home with a 
hope that I will be able to go there by a shorter way without a 
detour next time. 
  My dear fellow countrymen: Through the rectangular diplomacy 
which began toward the end of last year, I vividly felt that our 
country is importantly appraised in the international community. 
We can play a leading role in the Asia-Pacific era. We can 
stand aloft in the center of the new sphere of civilization. 
  Through the visits I have made, I renewed my resolve as well 
as my confidence. In the world ahead, competition will be even 
more keen among countries and regions. If we fail to keep up in 
competition, we will be a straggler and loser. The advanced 
countries were active in meeting this challenge. The countries 
that are catching up are also transforming themselves at a 
tremendous speed. The only way we must follow is to carry on a 
practical reform more vigorously. I will do my best as 
president to strengthen our security and promote the 
competitiveness of our country. 
  Let us all advance forward vigorously united in one, 
overcoming the syndrome peculiar to a transitional period. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [AP/YONHAP report from Moscow] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday [7 June], Russian Government officials 
said that sanctions against North Korea related to nuclear issue 
should be used only as a final means when all possible 
diplomatic efforts for the solution of the nuclear issue fail. 
  (Valenie Denikoskov), director of the Asia Affairs Bureau of 
the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters that 
Russia hopes to see the nuclear issue solved in a diplomatic and 
political way. He stressed that Russia would agree to the 
imposition of sanctions against North Korea only when all 
efforts for the solution of the issue were exhausted. 
  Prior to this, in an interview with Russia's INTERFAX news 
agency, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, also said that all 
possible efforts, including holding international conferences, 
should be made before the sanctions are imposed. He added that 
after that, sanctions should be introduced in stages. 
  Such remarks by officials of the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs differ from those made by President Kim Yong-sam during 
his visit to Moscow last week. President Kim once said that 
Russian President Yeltsin had expressed support for the 
imposition of sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's actions in 
the coming few days will determine China's stance at the UN 
Security Council on sanctions against Pyongyang, South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday. 
  Arriving in Beijing for strategic talks with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen, Han told reporters he would ask Beijing to 
tell North Korea exactly where the nuclear crisis stood so that 
Pyongyang would not make a misjudgement. "I came to seek China's 
support from two perspectives," Han said at the airport. "One is 
to seek its cooperation in preparing a sanctions resolution at 
the UN Security Council, and the other is to have China tell 
North Korea the feelings of the international community so that 
North Korea, for its own good, will not be uncooperative or make 
a misjudgement." 
  Han is expected to meet Qian for nearly two hours Thursday 
morning as the Security Council prepares to adopt a punitive 
resolution against North Korea. The resolution is likely to 
come next week. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam personally instructed 
Han 
to fly to Beijing from the United Nations for talks with Qian. 
  China has thus far honored its alliance with North Korea and 
advised more dialogue while opposing sanctions. Beijing's 
opposition remains a key obstacle to concerted efforts by the 
security council. 
  "It's a dead-end street right now," said Han when asked 
about 
the practicality of China's insistence on dialogue, "but it's 
still possible if North Korea changes its attitude even now. It 
all depends on North Korea."

  [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting 
the PRC, met with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on the 
morning of 9 June and asked for the PRC's understanding and 
cooperation regarding the recent tense moves to impose sanctions 
on North Korea. The following is a report by correspondent Yi 
Tong-sik from Beijing. 
  [Begin recording] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who arrived 
in Beijing late last night from New York via Tokyo, had a 
breakfast meeting with PRC Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen this morning at Diaoyutai. Although the details of 
this morning's discussions are not available, Minister Han 
Sung-chu reportedly explained the details of talks on sanctions 
on North Korea which were coordinated recently between countries 
concerned, including the United States and Japan, and asked for 
the PRC's understanding and cooperation. 
  Upon arrival in Beijing last night, Minister Han said that 
his visit to the PRC was to inform the PRC of the international 
community's consensus regarding the inevitability of sanctions 
on North Korea, as confirmed by the series of contacts with the 
United States and the United Nations, hoping that North Korea 
may take a cooperative attitude toward the resolution of the 
nuclear issue when the PRC conveys this to North Korea. 
  Minister Han Sung-chu reportedly discussed joint measures 
with the PRC while asking for the PRC's cooperation under 
circumstances in which sanctions on North Korea have become 
inevitable. 
  The PRC's reaction to today's meeting has yet to be 
revealed. 
After holding talks with Minister Qian Qichen, Minister Han 
Sung-chu will return to Seoul directly. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- There is no basis to 
believe North Korea's claim that there is still a chance to 
trace back its past nuclear activities, Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said Thursday. 
  Arriving from Beijing, after two-hour strategic talks with 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Han said he is "satisfied 
with the substance of the discussions with Qian." 
  He emphasized that South Korea, Japan, and the United States 
are working for a U.N.-backed sanction resolution on North Korea. 
  "We are not working on assumption that the resolution will 
not be passed at the Security Council," he said when asked about 
the possibility of actions outside the United Nations. 
  Despite reports that Qian insisted on more dialogue with 
North Korea on the nuclear crisis, Han said he expects China to 
continue playing a constructive role. 
  "The problem is that dialogue hasn't taken us very far," 
said 
Han, "China has said it will play a constructive role, and I 
expect such role to continue." 
  Asked whether Qian said clearly whether Beijing will or will 
not oppose sanction resolution, the foreign minister said he did 
not anticipate a yes-or-no answer to begin with. 
  "The meaning of consultations such as this is in mutual 
understanding, widening our consensus," said Han. 
  He belittled North Korea's insistence that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can still recount the history of its 
nuclear activities. 
  "From the information and facts gathered so far, there is no 
basis to believe that the history can be recounted," he said. 
  "But if North Korea does present the ways to reveal its past 
activities and fully cooperate with the safeguards agreement, 
then that will open the road to dialogue," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (YONHAP) -- China virtually refused 
Seoul's request Thursday to participate in UN sanctions against 
North Korea, but agreed on the gravity of the nuclear situation 
and promised diplomatic efforts to find a solution. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with his 
Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen for nearly two hours in the 
morning, but they failed to narrow their differences on 
Beijing's crucial participation in the sanctions, officials at 
the South Korean embassy said after the meeting. 
  Han tried to explain why the UN Security Council was 
compelled to seek sanctions against North Korea and asked for 
China's active involvement, officials said. 
  But Qian withheld comment on such explanations and instead 
urged all directly involved parties -- South and North Korea, 
the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) -- to leave the door open for dialogue, said Kim 
Ha-chung, minister at the South Korean Embassy. 
  Nevertheless, the Chinese foreign minister agreed with Han 
on 
the seriousness of the current situation and promised his 
country's best efforts in full consideration of the matter's 
gravity, he said. 
  The officials said they took this remark as a sign of 
China's 
willingness to persuade North Korea and mediate between the 
North and the United States to resolve the nuclear row. 
  China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council with 
veto power, does not favor punitive steps against North Korea 
and thus poses a major obstacle to a council resolution, 
expected next week, spelling out sanction measures. 
  The participation of China, a major supplier of crude oil to 
North Korea which shares a common border with the reclusive 
state, is considered critical to effective sanctions. 
  Han flew into Beijing late Wednesday after holding strategic 
talks with council members earlier this week. 
  The two foreign ministers agreed to cooperate closely at 
both 
the Security Council and bilaterally in seeking a resolution, 
according to Kim. 
  Han briefed Qian on the IAEA's report to the Security 
Council 
last week and South Korea's ensuing consultations with the 
permanent members of the council. 
  He stressed that China's role is more important than ever as 
sanctions are being discussed, the officials said.

  [Text] There have been some reports that Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin warned North Korea to accept negotiations on the 
nuclear issue when he met on 7 June with Choe Kwang, chief of 
general staff of North Korea's Army during his visit to China. 
However, it has been learned this is not true. 
  One high-ranking official of the ROK Embassy in China said: 
I understand that President Jiang did not make a detailed 
mention of North Korea's nuclear issue, but only confirmed the 
traditional friendship between the two countries when he met 
with Chief of General Staff Choe.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Jun (MENA)--North Korean Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam has accused the United States of abandoning the 
commitments it made during the first and second rounds of joint 
talks with North Korea last summer in Geneva on the nuclear 
issue in the Korean peninsula. 
  In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH that will be published on 
Thursday, the foreign minister explained that the most important 
of these commitments was to continue the dialogue and the 
negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang to reach a 
peaceful solution to the problem, respect the sovereignty of 
North Korea, stop the military maneuvers that the United States 
conducts with South Korea, and replace the lead-operated nuclear 
reactor in North Korea with one operated by light water [wa 
istibdal al-mufa'il al-nawawi lada kuriya al-shamaliyah wa 
al-ladhi ya'malu bi al-rasas bi mufa'il jadid ya'malu bi al-ma' 
al-khafif]. 
  The Korean official affirmed that his country has offered 
all 
facilities to the inspection committees sent by the 
International Atomic Energy Commission. The commission made 
unacceptable requests to Pyongyang to open the military bases 
for inspection, based on information and photographs taken by 
U.S. spy satellites. This led the Pyongyang government to 
reject the request and to propose a four-point initiative to 
solve the crisis. These are: resumption of the bilateral talks 
between Washington and Pyongyang; U.S. withdrawal of its nuclear 
weapons from South Korea; North Korean submission of the 
necessary guarantees to accept periodic and non-periodic 
inspection of its nuclear installations; and North Korean return 
to the treaty banning the dissemination of nuclear weapons as a 
full member with all obligations. 
  Answering a question about North Korea's position if the UN 
Security Council adopts a resolution to impose sanctions against 
it, the North Korean foreign minister said that in such a case 
his country will withdraw from the treaty banning the 
dissemination of nuclear weapons and will view such a resolution 
as a declaration of war. It will not sit idle in the face of 
the plots being prepared against it.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Kim Yong-sam by Yi Song-chun, </F>
HANGUK ILBO editor-in-chief, at Chongwadae, presidential 
offices, on 8 June on the 40th anniversary of HANGUK ILBO's 
founding] 
  [Excerpt] [Yi Song-chun] What do you think are the 
biggest achievements from your visits to Russia and Uzbekistan? 
  [Kim Yong-sam] The ROK and Russia have established 
constructive and reciprocal relations, and the ROK and 
Uzbekistan have built a basis for stepping up substantive 
cooperative relations. It is important, in particular, that the 
ROK and Russia have stepped up a cooperation system to resolve 
the North Korean nuclear issue, confirmed that the North 
Korean-Russia Mutual Assistance Treaty would be nullified, and 
that Russia promised it would stop supplying weapons and parts 
to North Korea. I think another big achievement is that I have 
inspired a sense of pride in ethnic Koreans in Russia and 
Uzbekistan and that those two countries promised that they would 
not discriminate against those ethnic Koreans. 
  [Yi] Separately from sanctions by the UN Security Council, 
the ROK, the United States, Japan, and other countries have 
reportedly been discussing independent sanctions against North 
Korea with regard to the North Korean nuclear issue. Is it true? 
  [Kim] The UN Security Council adopting a resolution on 
sanctions against North Korea is the most important task at the 
moment. I do not think it is appropriate to mention any other 
sanctions other than those by the UN Security Council at a time 
when multilateral consultations have been under way to impose 
sanctions through the UN Security Council. 
  [Yi] Have you examined ways to induce North Korea to come to 
dialogue to give it an opportunity to prove the transparency of 
its nuclear activities? 
  [Kim] North Korea unilaterally continued to replace fuel 
rods and, thus, destroyed a basis for dialogue. Our 
government's clear position is that we cannot turn a blind eye 
to one or even half of a nuclear weapon. North Korea does not 
seem to realize that if it continues to develop nuclear weapons, 
it will lead to its own destruction. The prevailing 
international atmosphere is that North Korea must no longer be 
left intact and that no group that commits such acts must exist. 
I will discuss sanctions with U.S. President Clinton over the 
telephone. Therefore, if North Korea again wants dialogue, it 
must come up with a method that can facilitate such dialogue. 
We think the international community must take appropriate 
measures regarding North Korea's unilateral action. I do not 
think it is time for the ROK and the United States to discuss 
ways to induce North Korea into dialogue. 
  [Yi] If the intensity of UN sanctions increases and if North 
Korea tries to find a way out of this, will the tensions 
intensify? 
  [Kim] North Korea has threatened us by saying sanctions 
would lead to war. Therefore, the possibility is that tensions 
would intensify as the intensity of sanctions increases. 
However, we will not tolerate any reckless action by North 
Korea. Unlike in the past, we have sufficient strength to deter 
war and are following North Korean movements around the clock. 
We have on hand countermeasures against any unforeseen 
accidents and a few scenarios. 
  [Yi] Do you have a way in mind to persuade China to join in 
UN Security Council sanctions? 
  [Kim] It will be difficult for China to veto a UN Security 
Council resolution on sanctions. We have discussed this matter 
with China, as the United States has done. China profoundly 
perceives the seriousness of the situation. China has not said 
it would veto a resolution. China has a sense of responsibility 
because the UN Security Council adopted a presidential statement 
at China's request, even though the ROK and the United States at 
first pursued to pass a resolution. China knows very well that 
North Korea has not shown any sincerity, even though the 
countries concerned have made efforts for a peaceful solution. 
I think, therefore, China will eventually join in the 
international efforts. 
  [Yi] Would you consider invalidating the joint declaration 
on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula if North Korea's 
nuclear transparency cannot be verified in the end? 
  [Kim] The joint declaration on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula deserves respect in terms of establishing the 
order for nuclear-free peace. Our government's will to comply 
with the joint declaration on the denuclearization remains firm. 
However, I am afraid that if North Korea does not stop 
developing nuclear weapons, our government's will to comply with 
the joint declaration on the denuclearization will be seriously 
challenged. 
  [Yi] Many people observe that reunification by absorption 
will be inevitable. Are you willing to modify the reunification 
program in a more practical way? 
  [Kim] It is the government's firm stance that reunification 
should be achieved step-by-step through negotiations between the 
South and the North. In this way, reunification can be achieved 
with minimum aftereffects and in the meantime a bright future 
for the nation will be guaranteed. Thus, at the moment, I do 
not feel the need to modify the reunification program. 
  [Yi] Some people point out that the ROK people are relaxed 
about security. What is your plan for consolidating security 
and redressing military appearance, which has been downgraded? 
  [Kim] Our security is only possible when all our people bear 
a solid sense of security and when a strong Army is maintained 
to safeguard peace. However, I am concerned that some people 
tend to be too optimistic about the situation on the Korean 
peninsula where North Korea is still a threat. Common sense 
cannot be used when judging North Korea. Our people are too 
ignorant of this. They think North Korea is not a match for us, 
but you never know when and what they will do. We can prevent 
misjudgment about North Korea when all the people bear in mind 
that a cornered North Korea might be provoked anytime and be 
fully prepared for it. I have endeavored through reform to form 
a clean Army free from political influence. I am sure military 
morale is up rather than down because military reform has a pure 
intention and was desired by the majority of the soldiers. 
There had been temporary pain in the beginning, but now the 
Army is respected and loved by the people. I recently visited 
frontline units and witnessed that many officers and men are 
silently working to fulfill their duties. The ROK people should 
recognize and respect the utmost devotion of the officers and 
men in defending the country under difficult conditions. 
  [Yi] What is your plan in the humanitarian aspect regarding 
North Korean fugitives in China? 
  [Kim] Our government is deeply concerned about and seeking 
resolutions for the safety and freedom of North Koreans who 
escaped to China. Please understand that it is difficult to 
reveal the details. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said that the North 
Korean Army is maintaining the highest-level war-readiness 
posture [choego sujunui chonjaeng chunbi taeserul yujihago 
iddago] ever since 1990. At a Defense Committee meeting of the 
National Assembly held today, Minister Yi reported: Since 1989, 
the North Korean Army's military exercise was being continuously 
reduced but has been restored since the end of last year, and 
its ground troops' mobile exercise, joint exercise by the Navy 
and the Air Force, and Army- people cooperative anti-air-raid 
drill have been conducted very actively since the beginning of 
this year. 
  In particular, Minister Yi said the Ministry of People's 
Armed Forces conducted an inspection to evaluate 
combat-readiness in mid- April and began to do follow-up 
inspections to confirm it in May. 
  He also reported that North Korea carried out a test fire of 
a new-type ground-to-ship missile in May and has begun to make 
preparation for test-firing the Taepodong No. 1, 2, and 3 whose 
range is more than 1,000 kilometers. 
  Minister Yi said: In summary, we have reached the conclusion 
[pyongga] that the North Korean Army has entered the 
highest-level war-readiness posture ever since 1990. As yet, 
however, there have been no inclination of specifically 
belligerent moves [kuchejogin tugi tonghyang]. 
  In particular, Minister Yi noted that we cannot ignore the 
possibility of North Korea's sudden provocation relying on its 
military superiority in number [sujoguro usehan kunsaryokman 
midgo ubalchoguro tobalhal kanungsongdo paejehalsu optago] as 
the difficult situation makes it impossible for North Korea to 
maintain nuclear transparency while possessing nuclear weapons. 
  He continued: Accordingly, our Army has strengthened its 
early warning posture and is making every preparation to 
immediately pursue strong, punishing, and retaliatory operations 
[chukkak kangnyokang ungjing pobok chakchonul pyolchil modun 
chunbirul hago idda] against international provocation by the 
North Korean Army [kukchejok tobal].

  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is believed to 
have already extracted plutonium needed in developing nuclear 
arms and registered a considerable progress in nuclear arms 
development, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said on Thursday. 
  Testifying at the National Assembly Defense Committee, Yi 
said Pyongyang began developing nuclear weapons in the 1950s or 
60s, concentrating on the training of nuclear experts, enriching 
nuclear knowhow, securing plutonium and testing nuclear 
detonators. 
  Yi said that if sanctions were taken against them, North 
Korea may provoke localized armed clashes as a means of finding 
a way out of the difficulties they are faced with. 
  Besides, any minor clashes could escalate into battles of 
considerable magnitude once sanctions are enforced, he said. 
  "Our Armed Forces are fully prepared against any 
contingency, 
even an all-out war," he said. "We are now securing additional 
needs of war capability to beef up weak areas of our 
preparedness." 
  The defense minister said the present strength of the 
Korea-U.S. combined forces is powerful enough to cope with any 
localized provocation. 
  "In any case, South Korea and the United States stand fully 
prepared to cope with any scenario of North Korean provocation 
promptly and forcefully," Yi said. 
  To better cope with nuclear threats from North Korea, war 
deterrence will be beefed up, he said, adding that steps in this 
connection could include the firmer guarantee of the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella and a reinforced high-tech weapons system to 
counter the North's nuclear delivery means. 
  Yi further stressed that any sanctions against North Korea 
by 
the U.N. Security Council should be accompanied by firm security 
measures for the Korean peninsula. 
  "Since the sanctions, if taken, would be enforced by the 
United Nations, any U.N. Security Council resolution on 
sanctions should include an express provision that if North 
Korea provokes in defiance of such sanctions, it would be dealt 
with under the name of the United Nations," he said. 
  Yi also said North Korea's underground military 
installations 
number about 2,000. "The entire forward-area ground combat 
forces can be sheltered underground and so can major war planes 
and vessels," Yi said.

  [Text] At this time, the KBS station has sent a relay 
broadcasting car to Myongdong street in Seoul to hold interviews 
with people regarding the present situation on the Korean 
peninsula, as well as their feelings on the ROK Army's readiness 
to deal with North Korea. We have news from reporter Kim 
Han-chu regarding the people's feelings on national security. 
[Reporter Kim] This is reporter Kim from Myongdong. Now, 
Myongdong Street, where a darkness is deeply closed, is 
overflowing with citizens, who want to enjoy their early summer 
time in the middle of the city. The street is very active as 
ever, and, also, is very crowded with customers, who visit 
stores, as well as many cars that visit there. I feel the 
citizens' calmness from their walk on the street. The Myongdong 
street is very active and as calm as ever compared with the 
overseas atmosphere that has been rapidly changing as a result 
of the North Korean nuclear issue. However, citizens do not 
seem indifferent to the North Korean nuclear issue. I will have 
conversations, for a moment, with citizens who walk on the 
street regarding their feelings on the present situation, which 
is recently being called a crisis situation based on rumors of 
war. How are you? People say that the present situation on the 
Korean peninsula is a crisis situation. Do you think that war 
may break out on the peninsula? 
  [Unidentified man-on-the-street #1] I don't think that a war 
can break out. Also, I don't think that North Korea or the 
United States are reckless. It is important for North Korea to 
maintain its system. Therefore, North Korea will not easily 
invade South Korea. 
  [Reporter Kim] If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, 
what do expect will be the result? 
  [Unidentified man #1] I think that we can easily defeat 
North Korea. As one a military reservist, I, in my view, think 
that the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces combat capability is more 
superior to that of North Korea. 
  [Reporter Kim] They say that people are very indifferent to 
the present situation on the Korean peninsula. What do you 
think? 
  [Unidentified man #1] I also think that people are too 
indifferent to it. I think that the key reason for people's 
indifference to the present situation is due to the military 
leadership's intervention into politics in the past, or due to 
politicians' abuse of national security for the preservation of 
their power. Anyway, I think that we should be fully ready to 
deal with North Korea in order to avoid a war. 
  [Reporter Kim] I will have an interview with another man. 
You came to the Myongdong street with your family. I have one 
question for you. People say that the present situation on the 
Korean peninsula is a crisis situation. Do you think that a war 
may break out? 
  [Unidentified man #2] You mean a war. I don't think that a 
war will break out. 
  [Reporter Kim] Do you have a special reason for such an 
opinion? 
  [Unidentified man #2] If a war breaks out, we can win a 
victory because of our strong national power. Anyway, I don't 
think that a war will break out on the peninsula. 
  [Reporter Kim] If a war breaks out, what do you expect its 
result will be? 
  [Unidentified man #2] I don't know about the result. 
However, because of our strong national power, we can win a 
victory. 
  [Reporter Kim] I will have more interviews with people. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified man #3 ] I think that Kim 
Il-song will never break out a war as long as he is not crazy, 
because we should live together on the peninsula. 
  [Unidentified woman] I don't think that a war will break 
out. I think that our national power has been strengthened 
enough to avoid it. 
  [Unidentified man #4] I think that because the North Koreans 
are aware that we are strong, they cannot break out a war. 
  [Unidentified man #5] I believe that it is highly possible 
that a war will break out, because North Korea faces economic 
difficulties. 
  [Unidentified man #6] I don't think that North Korea can 
easily start a war because of Japan or the United States. [end 
recording] 
  [Reporter Kim] Most people believe that a war will not break 
out. Of course, the people's opmistic view that a war would not 
break out originates from their ardent desire that a war must 
not break out on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- The government has begun 
preparing a set of economic stabilization measures to guard 
against economic confusion that may result from United Nations 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said Wednesday that the 
government is preparing countermeasures in the judgement that 
the situation is likely to worsen rapidly after U.N. sanctions 
go into effect. 
  An EPB source said the government had started reviewing 
economic measures taken during such emergencies as the Pueblo 
and Oct. 26 incidents. In January 1968, the U.S. intelligence 
vessel Pueblo was seized by North Korean naval ships off Wonsan 
in the East Sea, and former president Park Chung-hee was 
assassinated on Oct. 26, 1979. 
  The source added the government measures will be determined 
through consultations among concerned cabinet ministers as soon 
as sanctions against Pyongyang are adopted by the United Nations. 
  If sanctions were imposed, economic, political and military 
unease could prevail in South Korea, leading to an imbalance in 
the supply and demand of daily necessities, the source 
explained. This highlights the need for government measures to 
ensure stable supply and demand of major items used by the 
general public. 
  In addition, the government will take steps to clear up 
uneasiness among foreign businessmen so that they do not avoid 
transactions with their Korean counterparts. 
  The EPB official explained, "Although we have not yet 
prepared detailed measures, we are studying programs minimizing 
the possible economic impact following a resolution on U.N. 
sanctions. We are preparing scenarios from diverse angles for 
the economic situation in accordance with the degree of North 
Korea's reaction to the sanctions."

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Yu Ho-chun, director of 
the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front 
for the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF], released a 
statement to the press on June 2 expressing the hope for an 
early meeting with South Korean political parties, organisations 
and public figures to discuss the convocation of a national 
conference. 
  Recalling that a consultative meeting of representatives of 
the government, political parties and public organisations of 
the DPRK on the 25th of May selected the North side's delegates 
to the preparatory committee of the national conference and, at 
the same time, urged the South Korean authorities to show an 
affirmative response to the North's proposal for the convocation 
of a national conference and select the South side's delegates 
to the preparatory committee as soon as possible, thereby 
keeping step with the North, Yu Ho-chun said the South Korean 
authorities, however, are still taking a wrong position. 
  The true road of patriotism which should be chosen by the 
nation at present is to oppose war and confrontation and for all 
the compatriots in the North, South and overseas to be 
reconciled and united, transcending all the differences, and the 
most reasonable way for it is to convene a national conference. 
  If the conference is to be convened as scheduled, we think, 
it is necessary for the political parties, organisations and 
public figures in the North and South who want reunification to 
meet in whatever form, to begin with, and have open-hearted 
discussions for a successful conference under the condition 
where the preparatory committee for the national conference has 
not yet been formed and the South Korean authorities are laying 
hurdles in its way. 
  From this point of view the DFRF Central Committee urges the 
South Korean political parties, organisations of reunification 
movement and politicians and public figures who want contacts 
with us to meet in whatever form as soon as possible at any 
place. 
  The South Korean authorities should not bar the 
representatives of the South Korean political parties and 
organisations and patriotic-minded figures from contacting us, 
but, though belatedly, positively respond to the proposal for 
the convocation of a national conference desired by all the 
fellow countrymen, clearly mindful that the convocation of the 
historic national conference is a national-historical demand.

<F P=106> ["Separatist's Boloney Against Reunification" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
of South Korea in an interview with the U.S. NEWSWEEK on May 31 
took exception to the DPRK's proposal for founding the 
Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo [DCRK]. He told the 
NEWSWEEK that the "Yemen-style reunification based on 
confederacy" would "only result in a tragedy as illustrated by 
the situation in Yemen" and that "we should achieve durable 
reunification". 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's comment on the "Yemen-style 
reunification based on confederation" without any knowledge of 
the domestic situation of Yemen is meant to connect the DPRK's 
DCRK founding proposal with the Yemen situation in a far-fetched 
manner in a bid to sling mud at the proposal, a NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today says, and goes on: 
  His opposition to the North's DCRK founding proposal means, 
in the final analysis, denying a peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  The DPRK's confederacy formula based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments has enjoyed widespread 
support and sympathy of not only the entire Korean people in the 
North and the South and abroad but of the world's progressive 
people for its validity, reasonableness and feasibility. 
  Much upset by the enormous vitality of the DPRK's 
confederacy 
formula, the Kim Yong-sam group has resorted to all the 
demagogy, calling it a "strategy of reunification through 
communization" and saying it would result in a "tragedy", in an 
effort to keep its influence from spreading far and wide in 
South Korea rapidly and dampen the ever mounting peaceful 
reunification sentiments of the people. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam is a heinous separatist who has 
opposed national reunification, the supreme task of the nation, 
saying "the concept of hasty reunification is a daydream" and 
"reunification without liberal democracy and market economy is 
no better than division". 
  The "three-stage reunification formula" brought forward by 
him by reenacting his preceding dictators' permanent national 
division proposal with only slight paint on it is a replica of 
the "institutional reunification" doctrine that presupposes 
confrontation and war between the fellow countrymen. It will 
only heighten distrust and confrontation and, furthermore, 
result in a conflict and irretrievable national disasters. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's talk about "durable 
reunification" 
is, in the final analysis, meant to realize the ambition of 
northward invasion and reunification by "strength", maintaining 
the reactionary colonial system of South Korea and extending it 
even to the North.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets 
on June 6 and 7 committed a grave military provocation by 
illegally introducing recoilless guns and large-calibre 
machineguns into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and staging a 
shooting exercise against the North, military sources said. 
  On the 7th of June, they deployed 90 mm recoilless guns in 
the DMZ under the nose of Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, and staged 
an exercise of firing at a post of the North side. 
  Earlier, on the 6th, they brought many armed bandits and 
large- calibre machineguns to the DMZ off Mt. Wolbi in Kosong 
County in the eastern sector of the front, Jawon-ri, Phyonggang 
County in the central sector and Imgang-ri, Jangpung County in 
the western sector, inciting a war atmosphere. 
  The reckless introduction of heavy weapons and military 
provocation by the South Korean puppets posed a grave threat to 
the safety of the Korean People's Army soldiers who were on a 
routine duty. 
  This is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation 
designed to push to a higher pitch of strain the situation in 
the DMZ where Armed Forces of the two sides are in acute 
confrontation with the Military Demarcation Line in between. 
  The South Korean puppets must look squarely at the 
developments in the DMZ, stop acting recklessly and pull the 
illegally introduced armed bandits and all the heavy weapons out 
of there at once.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Puppet Prime Minister of 
South Korea Yi Yong-tok made "a check-up of emergency duty 
posture" of "major organs" and the director of the puppet police 
agency instructed police to "intensify the alert posture" 
against the North. The U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea 
staged "an evacuation exercise" to test "prompt departure 
preparations" of U.S. troops and their families in case of 
emergency. 
  NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today says that such row can 
be 
seen only on the eve of a war and it suggests that the Kim 
Yong-sam group is leading the situation of the Korean peninsula 
nearer to the threshold of war in league with the outside forces. 
  We urged a stop to such a criminal act as turning the 
country 
into a nuclear war theatre of foreign forces, warning the Kim 
Yong-sam group more than once that "sanctions" sought by the 
imperialists under the pretext of fictitious "nuclear suspicion" 
against the North mean a war and there is no mercy in a war, the 
analyst says, and continues: 
  But the South Korean puppets, ignoring our warnings, are 
bringing clouds of a nuclear war by showing extra zeal in 
imposing "sanctions" on fellow countrymen. The "doctrine of 
inevitability of sanctions" peddled by the puppets is a doctrine 
of inevitability of war. 
  The puppets must know that their provocative war move 
against 
the North may cause irrevocably grave consequences. 
  We want peace, not war. But we will never allow anyone to 
provoke us.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, chairman 
of the Central Committee of the General Federation of the Unions 
of Literature and Art of Korea, in a statement on June 7 
expressed the hope that the federation and organisations of 
literature and art of South Korea would have a contact in 
Pyongyang or Seoul or Panmunjom at an early date on the occasion 
of August 15. 
  Noting that the convocation of a national conference is a 
timely and reasonable measure to remove the danger of a war 
created in Korea and open up a new phase of reunification in the 
90s with concerted efforts of the nation, he said: 
  "However desperately the South Korean authorities may block 
the convocation of a national conference, they cannot break the 
will of the 70 million fellow countrymen to hold the conference. 
  "When delegates of organisations of literature and art in 
the 
North and the South sit at one place, a common action guideline 
of the national conference will be shaped and things favorable 
to peace of the country and its peaceful reunification will be 
done. 
  "I express the hope that the men and organisations of 
literature and art of South Korea that value justice and 
conscience will actively respond to our patriotic proposal."

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Relatives of unconverted 
long-term prisoners in South Korea, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
in the northern half of Korea sent letters to South Korean 
organizations on June 8 calling upon them to actively cooperate 
in the struggle for their early repatriation to the North. The 
letters were addressed to the headquarters for the promotion of 
the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, the Human Rights 
Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar 
Association for a Democratic Society and the Council of the 
Movement of Families for Democracy. 
  Kim Pong-son and Kim Pong-suk, younger sisters of Kim In-so, 
in their letter said their brother, who was taken prisoner while 
active as a guerrilla in the area of the South side during the 
war, should have been returned to his hometown right after the 
ceasefire under the international law. 
  They charged that the South Korean authorities kept their 
brother in prison for more than 30 years for the mere reason 
that he refused to recant his belief and, after his release from 
prison, are refusing to send him home with the far-fetched 
argument that he is not a prisoner of war. 
  They said they, old women now in the evening of their life, 
earnestly request the organizations of the South side to make 
their utmost efforts for the repatriation of their brother to 
the North where his children, family and relatives are waiting 
for him, while he can walk on his own feet. 
  Paek Chong-kwon, a nephew of Ham Se-hwan, in his letter said 
the fact that his uncle requested various organizations to 
cooperate in his repatriation, not yielding his will despite 
harsh persecutions, tells that he does not want to live in South 
Korea but earnestly hopes to return to his hometown where his 
flesh and blood live. 
  Recalling that the South Korean Red Cross side took a 
negative attitude by refusing the just demand of the DPRK Red 
Cross society for his repatriation with the unreasonable 
allegation that he could not be "regarded as a prisoner of war" 
and he "has got citizenship", the letter says this runs counter 
to the spirit of the Red Cross. 
  He expressed the belief that the organizations would make 
positive efforts to realize the repatriation of his uncle 
without fail.

  [Text] Beijing, June 7 [date as received] (KCNA) -- 
"Strengthening and developing Sino-Korean friendship are the 
firm policy of our party and government as well as the desire of 
our whole party and people, and we will make efforts to this 
end," declared Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central 
Committee [C.C.] of the Communist Party of China, president of 
the republic and chairman of the Central Military Commission. 
  He said this when he met Tuesday the visiting military

Choe Kwang, member of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the 
Workers' Party of Korea, vice-chairman of the National Defence 
Committee of the DPRK and chief of the General Staff of the

one 
provided, consolidated and developed by the respected leader of 
the Korean people Comrade Kim Il-song together with Chairman Mao 
Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and other revolutionary veterans of 
the Chinese people and forged in blood. 
  Noting that the two countries are friendly neighbours in the

countries and two armies have traditional relations of 
friendship.

relations -- past or present -- is always of great significance. 
  "The Chinese party and government regard their friendly 
relations with the DPRK important, and are satisfied with the 
development of the relations between the two parties and two 
countries," he added.

  [Text] Islamabad, June 6 -- The Ambassador of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) in Pakistan 
Choe Su-il today accused the United States of persisting with 
its hostile posture against his country despite the flexibility 
the DPRK had shown in allowing international inspectors to visit 
its sole nuclear power reactor. 
  A team of experts of the Vienna-based International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) are currently positioned at the Yongbyong 
Nuclear Reactor along with cameras watching the change of fuel 
at the facility but still "the US was finding excuses" for 
carrying on its hostile posture and propaganda against North 
Korea, he said while addressing a Press conference at his 
residence here on Monday. 
  According to operational rules when the fuel at a nuclear 
plant was spent up at after [as published] about 10 years, it 
has to be replaced with fresh fuel because its dust becomes 
weapon-oriented. Since North Korea did not want to retain the 
dangerous spent-up fuel it had invited the IAEA inspectors to 
watch the changing process themselves. 
  Talking about the Yongbyong nuclear power facility Mr Choe 
said it was a harmless nuclear plant with a small capacity of 
only 5 megawatt. Moreover, it was an experimental reactor of 
'graphite and moderated type'. The North Korean government had 
undertaken to change it into a light water reactor so that it 
did not release the weapon-making dust and as such remove 
doubts, if any, of the reactor being used for making nuclear 
weapons. 
  He said the flimsy pretexts being advanced by the United 
States on North Korea's nuclear programme were not actually 
meant to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. In reality and as a 
matter of fact the Americans wanted to destroy and put an end to 
the socialist system practised in North Korea under its global 
policy of decimating socialist system wherever it existed, said 
the DPRK envoy. 
  One of the most dangerous postures of the United States in 
his view was the stationing of 38,000 American troops on the 
South Korean soil plus deployments of 1,000 nuclear war-heads 
and setting up of several 'Patriot' missiles, which were used 
with devastating effect against Iraq in 1991. 
  Additionally, the DPRK Ambassador went on, the American 
troops and the South Korean army would conduct on the South 
Korean soil army exercises called 'Team Spirit 94.' 
  Mr. Choe accused the United States of abandoning direct 
talks 
with North Korea on 'artificial excuses' which was against the 
clear-cut commitment it had made in an agreement with North 
Korea more than a year ago. Not only that the Americans had 
also adopted threatening attitude towards his country and one of 
the threats being mentioned was the applying of sanctions 
against it. 
  If the United States chose to shut the door for direct talks 
with the DPRK the next step of his government would be to 
proceed to the next step in its peaceful nuclear programme which 
also included expansion of independent nuclear power industry. 
If the pressurisation and threatening stance of the United 
States did not end, North Korea would have no choice but to come 
out permanently from its promise to sign the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty [NPT], warned Choe Su-il, but explained 
that the withdrawal from NPT did not mean that North Korea would 
start making nuclear weapons.

  [Text] According to a foreign news report, in his recent 
interview with NBC television, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry made 
dangerous and warmanic remarks that a preemptive strike against 
North Korea remains an option. 
  Perry unhesitatingly made such warmanic remarks at a time 
when the United States and its followers are attempting to 
impose undisguised sanctions under the pretext of our 
nonexistent nuclear issue. This is an unpardonable criminal act 
which will lead the situation to the door of war [chonjaengui 
munogwie kkaji]. This clearly shows that the U.S. military 
action to crush [apsal] us has now entered an adventurous stage 
for carrying out a real warfare. [silchonul pyolchinun

<F P=106> ["Blast of War Fanatic" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense Secretary 
Perry appeared on NBC television recently and let out the 
dangerous blast that "a preemptive strike against North Korea 
remains an option", according to a foreign press report. 
  The reckless war blast of Perry came at a time when the 
United States and its followers were seeking openly to impose 
"sanctions" on the DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear issue". 
This is an unpardonable criminal act of driving the situation 
to the brink of war. 
  Recently, Perry put the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea 
in "a round-the-clock alert posture" and brought the extra-large 
carrier Independence to the waters where it could enter into war 
exercises against the North within a few days, and planned a 
large-scale naval war exercise in the waters around the Korean 
peninsula, inciting a war fever. 
  Judging from the fact that Perry threatened a "preemptive 
attack" on the extension line of these military moves, it is 
only too clear that it was not a mere threat but a war blast 
signalling the green light to the actually provocation of a 
second Korean war. 
  It is a gross miscalculation if the U.S. hardline 
conservative force think they can overpower the North through a 
"surprise attack" by force of arms, without the least intention 
to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  We are fully prepared to cope with any case.

<F P=106> ["They Must Not Miscalculate" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the U.S. act in driving the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the phase of war. 
  Warning that it must stop its harebrained act, facing 
squarely the reality, the analyst says: 
  The United States is planning to additionally deploy a task 
force comprising a carrier flotilla, tactical flying corps, "B 
52" strategic bombers, etc. In South Korea, Japan and the west 
Pacific region. The U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said "a 
preemptive strike at Pyongyang's nuclear facilities remains an 
option" and U.S. Senator McCain called for "a military 
strong-arm action," crying that "North Korea must be bombed." 
  All this patently proves that the United States does not 
have 
the intention to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula by peaceful means and is using the "nuclear issue" of 
the DPRK as a card in the war gambling to stifle it. 
  The U.S. ruling quarters, for all their lipservice to 
"peace" and "relaxation of tensions" on the Korean peninsula, is 
actually seeking heightened tensions and military adventures, 
remaining captive to the consciousness of confrontation and war 
psychology. 
  The United States is even scheming to send U.S. 
reinforcements to the Korean front from Alaska and Germany and 
50 warships, more than 200 warplanes and a U.S. naval force 
25,000 strong based in Hawaii have started for the Korean waters. 
  It is a mistake to try to subdue and stifle the DPRK by 
strength. The hardline conservatives of the United States seem 
to be ignorant of our faith and might. We regard independence 
and socialism as our life and blood. We are resolved and ready 
to counter any military option of the United States.

<F P=106> ["Colonial Puppet Regime Clinging To Sleeves of U.S. </F>
Troops"-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today brands the South Korean "regime" which is 
prolonging its days in reliance on outside forces as a colonial 
puppet regime right down to its toes. 
  This is fully illustrated by the attitude of the puppets 
toward the U.S. Forces in South Korea, the article says, and 
goes on: 
  Now countries and nations all over the world are lifting up 
loud voices demanding the dismantling of the U.S. military bases 
in their territories. But only the South Korean puppets are 
running the gamut of folly, entreating for the permanent 
occupation of South Korea by the U.S. Forces and "protection by 
the nuclear umbrella". 
  When the anti-American sentiments ran high in South Korea, 
the United States said it would withdraw its forces from South 
Korea in order to lull them. If the South Korean puppets had an 
iota of national conscience, they should have welcomed its 
intention to take back its aggression forces to their den across 
the ocean. They, however, entreated the United States not to 
withdraw its forces from South Korea and even staged the drama 
of "a cabinet resignation en bloc." 
  They pay a colossal amount of fund for the maintenance of 
the 
U.S. forces. The United States pays the rent to the countries 
where its aggression troops are stationed for the use of bases. 
However, it does not pay a penny for many military bases in 
South Korea but uses them free of charge and receives billions 
of dollars from the puppets every year in burden sharing. 
  To justify this mean act the South Korean puppets talk 
volubly about "protection by the nuclear umbrella". But it is 
an outburst which can be let out only by those obsessed with 
flunkeyist treacheries. The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique is 
meaner than any other preceding rulers in serving the U.S. 
master. Promising a larger burden share than the preceding 
"regimes", the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique entreated the U.S. to 
permanently leave its forces in South Korea and made it shelve 
the "U.S. troop cutback plan". 
  They are trying to keep the aggression forces in South Korea 
at any cost and slay the fellow countrymen in the North with 
their help. But this is a foolish act of tightening the noose 
around their own neck. 
  How can they be safe, the traitors who pay to the master the 
expenses for the maintenance of the aggression forces by empting 
the pockets of the people, imploring them to slay fellow 
countrymen, while leaving the land and the people under their 
jackboots query. 
  The colonial puppet regime dependent on the United States, 
which has no sovereignty, will meet its doom, rejected by the 
people.

<F P=106> ["New `Operational Plan' Will Precipitate Their Own </F>
Downfall" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today in 
an article deals with the "operational plan to allure the U.S." 
which was discussed at "a top-secret consultation" after a 
"meeting of security-related ministers" held by the South Korean 
puppets on November 10 last year. Branding it as a plan for the 
provocation of a war, the author of the article says: 
  "Alluring the U.S." (miin) being the same with "a belle" in 
pronunciation, one may misinterpret it as a "beauty operation" 
for bewitching men by using beautiful women. But it means a 
plan to allure the United States into "sanctions" and war 
against the DPRK by leading the situation of the Korean 
peninsula to the highest pitch of strain. 
  After the closet consultation dangerous war exercises 
against 
the North have been staged more openly on the ground and in the 
sky and sea. This shows that the `operational plan' is being 
carried into practice. 
  Holding such military confabs as "meeting of 
security-related 
ministers" one after another, the "civilian" warmaniacs let out 
a torrent of bellicose words such as "a prompt reaction" and "a 
tough response." 
  Some time ago, "Kim Yong-sam the traitor called to 
"Chongwadae" [presidential offices] the puppet minister of 
defence, the puppet chairman of the joint chiefs of Staff, the 
chiefs of staff of the puppet Army, Navy and Airforce for a war 
confab and ordered them to put the puppet Armed Forces on "a 
stand-by alert," vociferating about "perfection" of preparations 
for a war against the North with "a coopertion system" with the 
United States. The puppets are even trumpeting "unification by 
invading the North." 
  Having placed the entire puppet Armed Forces on "a stand-by 
alert" the Kim Yong-sam group is discussing "UN sanctions" or 
"multinational sanctions" with the masters,' while bringing 
forward its own anti-national "policy of sanctions against the 
North". This shows well what a reckless stage its frenzy of 
northward invasion has reached. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must ponder over the matter, mindful 
that confrontation and war will precipitate its self-destruction.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese SANKEI 
SHIMBUN recently exposed that a Japan-U.S. nuclear secret 
agreement was signed in November, 1969, allowing the 
introduction and passage of U.S. nuclear weapons to Okinawa, 
Japan. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article 
today 
says the signing of the agreement has rendered legality to the 
introduction, deployment and use of U.S. nuclear weapons in 
Japan and reduced the islands of Japan to a U.S. nuclear forward 
base against socialist and Asian countries. 
  The disclosure of the agreement has made it all the clearer 
that the "three non-nuclear principles" which the Japanese 
rulers have claimed to be "a symbol of a non-nuclear, peaceful 
state" is nothing but a screen for covering up the introduction 
of U.S. nuclear weapons and Japan's nuclear armament, the 
article says, and goes on: 
  It was with a view to promoting their own nuclear armament 
program under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" and with the U.S. 
assistance that the Japanese reactionaries made a secret nuclear 
deal with the United States even by harming the dignity and 
interests of the Japanese people. 
  The Japanese ruling quarters have, in actuality, been 
accelerating their nuclear armament behind the screen of the 
"three non-nuclear principles". They have already secured 
technologies and facilities for the development of nuclear 
weapons and even their launching system. 
  The operation of Monju, a fast breeder reactor for 
abstracting quantities of plutonium, means a new dangerous step 
in the Japanese reactionaries' nuclear armament. 
  Now, Japan can become a nuclear power any moment it decides 
to. 
  Their noisy talk over the DPRK's "nuclear issue" is a clumsy 
trick to divert elsewhere the public attention at home and 
abroad and find an excuse for their own nuclear armament and 
reinvasion of Korea. 
  Stupid and reckless are the Japanese reactionary ruling 
quarters' acts of bringing another nuclear disaster to Japan, 
far from drawing a lesson from their defeat in the past. 
  They would be well advised to stop playing a "nuclear 
hide-and- seek" under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella".

<F P=106> ["Revived Militarist Ghost" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- In a recent 
interpellation at Diet, Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said whether the past war was a war of aggression, or not, will 
be known after the lapse of one hundred years. 
  Commenting on this NODONG SINMUN today says: The remarks of 
Hata who had reprimanded the former justice minister, Nagano, 
for describing the Pacific War as "a liberation war" shows his 
double- dealing tactics. 
  The analyst continues: 
  The outcries of Japanese cabinet ministers distorting 
history 
show once again the aggressive quality of the Hata cabinet. 
  The Japanese militarists who regard the restoration of the 
past policy of aggression as the strategy of the state set it as 
an important objective to restore the old colonial empire in 
Asia. 
  Having completed political, economic and military 
preparations for overseas aggression through the efforts to turn 
Japan into a military power and step up her nuclear armament, 
enact an "emergency case law" and a "wartime mobilization law", 
the Japanese ruling quarters are intensifying propaganda to 
mobilize the people in a war. The key point here is to obscure 
the character of the past war of aggression and whitewash and 
justify it. 
  The Japanese authorities reveal their intention to repeat 
the 
history of aggression when they affirmatively assess the past 
war of aggression and avoid the liquidation of the crimes of the 
blood- stained past. 
  Japan schemes to realise its dominationist ambition 
worldwide 
with strength by securing the permanent membership of the U.N. 
Security Council and accelerating her nuclear armament. 
  Japan must act with discretion, mindful that overseas 
aggression and war will lead her to her grave.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song today received Han Tok-su, chairman of the 
Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), staying in the socialist 
homeland. 
  Present on the occasion were Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and officials 
concerned. 
  Han Tok-su told President Kim Il-song: 
  "Great leader generalissimo Kim Il-song, how is your health 
of late? I should have paid you a visit first and expressed 
thanks to you. But you called on me at my lodging and inspired 
and encouraged me and today you have called me here. I feel I 
am too much indebted to you. 
  "The dear leader has provided me with best conditions of 
lodging and boarding and medical treatment and inquired after my 
health every day even under the complicated situation. I can 
hardly find proper words to express my gratitude. 
  "Under the loving care of you and the dear leader, I, who 
had 
been invalid, have become able to walk on the soil of the 
homeland on my feet. Thank you very much! 
  "I will continue to concentrate myself on medical treatment 
to repay the love and solicitude of you and the dear leader. I 
will have my health recovered as early as possible, return to 
Japan and make all efforts to firmly build up Chongnyon. 
  "I wholeheartedly wish you and the dear leader good health 
and a long life." 
  President Kim Il-song expressed thanks for this and 
conversed 
with him in a cordial atmosphere.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the Korean Buddhists Federation sent a letter to Buddhist 
organizations in Asian countries on June 1 concerning the fact 
that the Japanese authorities have begun to operate in real 
earnest the fast breeder reactor "Monju" which was named after 
"Maijusri" (Bodhisattva of Wisdom). 
  "Monju" is the Japanese pronunciation of "Bodhisattva of 
Wisdom". 
  Noting that the prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju", 
starting operation in April, is a plutonium breeder reactor for 
manufacturing nuclear bombs, developed by the Japanese 
militarists for the purpose of nuclear armament, the letter says: 
  With no excuse or fair words can the Japanese ruling 
quarters 
justify their abuse of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom" to this "devil- 
incarnate". 
  If the Japanese militarists' moves to gratify their ambition 
for a nuclear power by abusing even the name of Bodhisattva are 
not checked today, they would use another name of Bodhisattvas, 
Buddhist doctrines and Buddhist sutras to reduce us to slaves of 
their nuclear weapons and scapegoat falling victim to a nuclear 
holocaust tomorrow. 
  A nuclear disaster that may be caused by the Japanese fast 
breeder reactor "Monju" will cover the entire Asian region just 
as the sufferings and damages imposed by the Japanese 
imperialist aggression in the first half of this century had 
become a tragedy for the whole of Asia, not confined to any one 
country. 
  All the Buddhists and Buddhist organizations truly valuing 
human life should pool their minds and efforts irrespective of 
their respective borders and schools to expose and condemn the 
Japanese militarists' criminal acts of insulting Buddhism, and 
decisively remove from the earth in the name of Buddhism the 
Japanese fast breeder reactor which is becoming a hotbed of 
nuclear calamities behind the sign of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom". 
  The letter expresses the expectation that the Dharma friends 
in different countries will rise as one in the sacred struggle 
to frustrate Japan's nuclear power ambition and prevent a 
nuclear war in conformity with their fundamental aims of 
achieving peace and happiness of mankind.

<F P=106> ["Questions of Enhancing Position and Role of Non-Aligned </F>
Movement Discussed" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A series of questions of 
enhancing the position and role of the Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) to cope with the changed world situation were discussed at 
the non- aligned foreign ministers' conference held in Cairo, 
according to a report. 
  Speaking at the conference, Vice-premier and Foreign 
Minister 
Kim Yong-nam who was heading the DPRK delegation said that a 
great change took place in the world situation but the 
principles of independence, right to self-determination, 
non-alignment, preservation of world peace, disarmament and an 
establishment of a new international economic order which have 
been maintained by the nam, an important rostrum representing 
the interests of the developing countries, still have viability. 
  As long as there remain domination and interference, 
aggression and plunder on the globe, this movement must not only 
exist but also be strengthened as the leading force for the 
building of an independent, peaceful new world, he stressed. 
  Rejecting any attempt to change or weaken the fundamental 
idea and principles of NAM and its political character, he said 
what is important in strengthening this movement at present is 
to achieve unity and solidarity, while maintaining its basic 
idea and principles. 
  The final document adopted at the conference expressed 
concern over the fact that the Korean peninsula remains divided 
in spite of the desire and aspiration of the Korean people, and 
reaffirmed support to the Korean people's struggle to achieve 
the reunification of the country on the basis of the principles 
laid down in the North-South joint statement of July 4, 1972 and 
the agreement effectuated in February 1992. 
  Noting that to guarantee a durable peace and security on the 
Korean peninsula is not only a common desire of the Korean 
people but also an important matter related to the peace and 
security in Asia and the rest of the world, the document 
expressed the hope that the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula assuming political and military nature would be 
settled in a peaceful way through dialogue and negotiation 
between the parties concerned, DPRK-U.S. talks in particular. 
It took notice of the need of continuous cooperation with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- Israel recently 
kidnapped Mustafa Dirani, leader of the Shiite Amal Movement, an 
anti-Israel resistance organization in Southern Lebanon, by 
sending commandoes allegedly to find out the whereabouts of an 
Israeli airman missing in Southern Lebanon in 1986. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this is a grave infringement upon 
the sovereignty of Lebanon and a never-to-be-condoned terrorist 
act. 
  The analyst says: 
  Lebanon, bitterly denouncing this case as an encroachment on 
its sovereignty, strongly urged the United Nations Security 
Council to convene a session and Israel to release Dirani and 
all other Lebanese prisoners in Israel. 
  Lebanon is a party to Arab-Israel bilateral talks. 
  Israel is crying for peace talks, while continuing terrorism 
against its dialogue partner. Such an act can be justified 
with nothing. 
  The United States, styling itself "a judge" in the problem 
of 
terrorism and "a fair mediator" in the Mideast peace talks, is 
now ignoring the demand of Syria and other Arab nations for 
denouncing Israel's terrorism. This is really unreasonable. 
Israel must stop terrorism infringing upon the sovereignty of 
Arab nations including Lebanon and the United States must 
refrain from doing things obstructive to the Mideast peace 
process, taking an impartial stand.

<F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman Raps Israeli Bombing of Lebanon" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today answered a question put by KCNA on the recent bombing raid 
of Israel on Lebanon. 
  He said: 
  We sharply denounce this barbaric bombing, regarding it as a 
crude encroachment upon the sovereignty of Lebanon and a grave 
challenge wrecking the Mid-East peace process. 
  It is due to the unjustifiable pro-Israeli policy of the 
United States that the military offensive of Israel on Lebanon 
has not come to an end. This was made plain by the attitude 
taken by the United States toward the recent bombing case. 
  The United States, while crying for "sanctions" against the 
DPRK by bringing to the United Nations Security Council its 
"nuclear issue," which is not a matter for argument, as often as 
it pleases, connives at the military outrages of Israel which 
deserve denunciation and sanctions and tries to hush them up, 
ignoring the just demand of many countries. 
  If the United States is really concerned for world peace and 
security, it must not unreasonably take issue with our peaceful 
nuclear activities but pay primary attention to checking the 
aggressive acts of such countries as Israel, which are virtually 
disturbing world peace. 
  The Israeli authorities must stop the aggressive acts 
against 
Arab nations and withdraw from the occupied Arab territories 
without delay. 
  Our people will as ever express firm solidarity with the 
Arab 
people in their just struggle to resolve the Mid-East problem in 
a fair and peaceful way.

Carrying Forward Revolutionary Traditions"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN on Sunday 
carried an article headlined "Wise Guidance in Glorifying 
Socialism of Our Style by Carrying Forward Revolutionary 
Traditions". 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has given wise guidance 
in thoroughly applying the revolutionary traditions in all 
domains of the revolution and construction for 30 years from the 
first days of his guidance of the work of the Workers' Party of 
Korea, with the result that socialism of our style has been 
fortified as an invincible fortress, the article notes. 
  It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "Our party has consistently and firmly defended the glorious 
revolutionary traditions founded by the leader and is 
comprehensively carrying forward and developing them to meet the 
requirements of modelling the whole of society on the chuche 
idea." 
  Noting that the process of carrying forward the socialist 
cause to accomplishment is a process of defending and carrying 
forward the revolutionary traditions, the article says: 
  The question of carrying forward and applying the 
revolutionary traditions of chuche in our country today has been 
brilliantly solved by the energetic guidance of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  With the revolutionary traditions of chuche successfully 
carried forward and developed under his guidance, our socialism 
has been more firmly consolidated as invincible socialism with 
the chuche idea as its ideological foundation. 
  After newly expounding the fundamental principles and 
essence 
of the chuche idea which are the key points of the 
revolutionary traditions of chuche, he formulated the guiding 
idea of our party as an integral system of idea, theory and 
method of chuche. And he has further enriched and 
comprehensively developed in depth the chuche idea with new 
principles and contents suited to the requirements of the 
present time and the developing revolution. Our people who 
cherish the chuche idea as their faith are firmly convinced that 
our socialism is the best, our party is the best and our party's 
policies are absolutely just. 
  It is an immortal historical feat performed by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il for the era and the revolution that 
he has constantly consolidated and developed the ideological 
position of our style socialism by carrying forward and 
developing the revolutionary traditions of chuche. 
  With the revolutionary traditions of chuche successfully 
carried forward and developed under his wise guidance, our 
socialism has become a virile socialism powerfully advancing in 
reliance on the might of the strong driving force of the 
revolution. 
  He set it as one of most important tasks for the victorious 
advance of the socialist cause to defend the tradition of unity 
of our revolution and further consolidate and develop the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses, and 
has wisely led the efforts for its realisation. 
  Our party has achieved a solid singlehearted unity of the 
leader, the party and the masses by successfully carrying

  As it has carried forward the revolutionary traditions of 
chuche, our party has been strengthened and developed into an 
indestructible party incomparably great in purity in ideology 
and purpose and organizational solidity of the party ranks, its 
leadership method and art and its blood relations with the 
masses. The close singlehearted unity of the party and the 
people around the illustrious leader is the thing of greatest 
importance to our revolution and a powerful weapon in 
accomplishing the cause of socialism. 
  With the revolutionary traditions of chuche successfully 
applied under the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, our socialism has become socialism being developed by 
the revolutionary enthusiasm of the popular masses and their 
creative ingenuity. 
  He set it as an important matter for the victorious advance 
of the socialist cause to carry forward the tradition of the 
chuche method of mass leadership, and has wisely led the efforts 
to this end. 
  The Chongsanri spirit and Chongsanri method which were 
created by carrying forward the tradition of the chuche method 
of mass leadership under the energetic guidance of our party 
have been applied comprehensively and an epoch-making turn has 
been effected in the work of strengthening the blood ties 
between the party and the masses. 
  The energetic guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in consistently carrying forward and applying the 
tradition of the chuche method on mass leadership has fostered 
unquestioned trust of the popular masses in the illustrious

bond. 
  Today the revolutionary struggle and constructive work in 
our 
country are being carried out by the conscious enthusiasm and 
boundless devotion of the popular masses. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, an 
illustrious leader who is resolutely defending, carrying forward 
and developing the revolutionary traditions of chuche to 
accomplish the cause of socialism.

<F P=106> [Article by Choe Chong-hon: "Achieving the Goals of the </F>
Party's Economic Strategy Is a Key Factor in Defending and 
Adding Luster to Our-Style Socialism"] 
  [Text] At the moment, all of our workers are staging a 
vigorous struggle to add more luster to our-style socialism 
under the banner of singleheartedness and self-reliance, by 
upholding the party's leadership. The key factor in achieving a 
victory in this solemn struggle is to achieve the goals of the 
party's economic strategy by all means. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: "We 
should thoroughly achieve the strategic goals put forth by the 
party by thoroughly carrying through the revolutionary economic 
strategy under any circumstances." 
  Our party has put forth the struggle goals to suit the 
demands of the developing revolution and the actual conditions 
of the country with a view to wisely leading the struggle to 
achieve such goals. This is the principle of leadership that our 
party is consistently sticking to in socialist construction. 
  In the previous period, we were able to see our country's 
socialist construction march forward victoriously and 
unflinchingly even amid the formidable maelstrom of history. 
Today even in such a complicated and harsh situation, our 
people are vigorously struggling unshakably, overflowing with 
faith and optimism. There is a bright future of victory 
unfurling in the future path of our- style socialism. All of 
this was possible because our party is wisely leading the 
struggle to achieve the goals by putting forth correct goals. 
  Our party has established an adjustment period for the next 
three years on the basis of a scientific analysis of the present 
status of the changed international environment and our 
country's socialist economic construction. Our party put forth 
its basic goals of economic strategy to decisively solve the 
problems in people's livelihood by concentrating strength on the 
development of agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade; 
to normalize production in all sectors by giving priority to 
preceding sectors in the people's economy; and to help fully 
display the might of the existing economic foundation. Such 
goals put forth by the party are the most aboveboard goals for 
our-style economic strategy which completely meet the basic 
interest of our revolution and correctly reflect the aspirations 
and demands of our people. They serve as a milestone to further 
consolidate the self-reliance of the national economy and 
develop our country's socialist economic construction to a new 
higher level. 
  Today, the victory in the struggle to defend and add luster 
to our-style socialism depends on how the goals of the party's 
economic strategy are achieved. At the moment, the imperialists 
and reactionaries are strengthening their political and military 
pressure as well as the maneuverings for economic blockade in an 
unprecedented way in order to crush our republic which is 
marching on under the socialist banner. The key factor to smash 
such vicious maneuverings of the imperialists and reactionaries 
and to fully display the invincibility and vitality of our-style 
socialism lies in thoroughly achieving the party's economic 
strategy goals. Only when we achieve the party's economic 
strategy goals and gain great revolutionary upsurges in all 
sectors and all units of socialist construction can we smash any 
military provocations by the imperialists, their economic 
blockade, and their maneuverings for ideological and cultural 
disintegration, and can we more firmly consolidate our-style 
socialism as an ever-victorious fortress. 
  To achieve the goals of party's economic strategy is an 
important guarantee to increase the might of the country in 
every way. 
  The might of socialism is a political, ideological, and 
economic one; and confrontation with the imperialists is 
confrontation in economic power as well as confrontation in 
political and ideological strength. To win victory in 
confrontation with the imperialists, it is necessary to increase 
the country's strength in every way. To this end, it is 
necessary to firmly strengthen the country's economic and 
material foundation in conformity with the socialist demands as 
well as to firmly arm all people with the chuche idea of 
socialism. No matter how wonderful the socialist system is, and 
no matter how high the level of people's ideological sense is, 
we cannot firmly back up the political, ideological, and 
military might economically and materially, nor can we highly 
display the genuine superiority of socialism if we do not exert 
appropriate strength in harmoniously developing the present 
self-supporting economy through fortitude and if we do not 
strengthen the country's economic might. 
  The goals of the party's revolutionary economic strategy 
are a blueprint for firmly deepening the economic and material 
foundation of our country. To strengthen economic might it is 
imperative to regularize production in all sectors with emphasis 
on leading sectors of the national economy, and to fully enhance 
the might of the existing economic foundation. 
  To regularize production in all sectors of the national 
economy it is imperative to give priority to the coal industry, 
power industry, and railway transportation, which are the 
leading sectors of the national economy, and to develop the 
metal industry. Without giving priority to the leading sectors 
of the national economy, problems concerning raw materials, 
fuel, electricity, materials, and transport, which are necessary 
for implementing the agriculture- first, light industry-first, 
and trade-first policies, cannot be smoothly solved nor can 
production be carried out in a timely manner in all sectors of 
the national economy. 
  Only when priority is given to the leading sectors of the 
national economy can agricultural production, consumer goods 
production, and foreign exports be increased rapidly; production 
be regularized in all sectors of the national economy, so that 
the might of the self-reliant socialist economy is highly 
enhanced. 
  The goals of the party's economic strategy make it possible 
to give priority to the leading sectors of the national economy 
in conformity with the specific situation of our economy which 
is developing on a high foundation, to ensure a smooth 
production cycle by realizing reasonable production-consumption 
linkages and balance with related economic sectors and units, 
and to regularize production at a high level in overall economic 
sectors. The goals of the party's economic strategy also make 
it possible to see to it that the production potential of the 
existing economic foundation is fully demonstrated so that the 
existing economic foundation not only serves the development of 
the rural economy and light industry more fully, but also 
smoothly meets the constantly increasing material demands of 
society. 
  Accordingly, only when we realize the goals of the party's 
economic strategy can we correctly maintain the balance between 
econcomic construction and the people's living and overall 
economic balance, including the balance between production of 
means for production and production of consumer goods, and push 
ahead with overall socialist economic construction in a vigorous 
manner. We can also rapidly increase production in all sectors, 
further strengthen our economy's self-reliance, and, thus, make 
our economy invincible. In this way, we can not only firmly 
deepen the revolutionary position of our socialism as an 
invincible fortress and as an impregnable position by adding our 
economic and technological might to the political and 
ideological might of our style socialism, but also vigorously 
demonstrate the invincible driving force of chuche socialism. 
  Realizing the goals of the party's economic strategy without 
fail is also an important guarantee for firmly building our 
revolutionary ranks. 
  Our socialism is the most superior, popular, mass-centered 
socialism in which the people are the master of everything and 
everything serves the people. It is imperative to firmly build 
the revolutionary ranks to enhance the superiority of socialism 
and to glorify socialism of our own style. To do so, it is 
imperative for all members of the society to deeply recognize 
the true superiority of of the socialist system through their 
practical life. What is important in this is to see to it that 
the people feel that socialism of our own style is the basis for 
their true life and the cradle of their happiness, and we should 
ensure that the people enjoy a more affluent and happier life to 
their hearts content. 
  Rapidly increasing the level of the people's material and 
cultural life which is increasing in conformity with the 
socialist demands with each passing day is an important task 
arising before us today. The goals of the party's revolutionary 
strategy are precisely the blueprint to outstandingly realize 
this task. 
  The rapid expansion of the production of consumer goods is 
imperative to improving the standard of living. This depends on 
the level of might demonstrated by the existing means of 
production. 
  When the might of production of means of production 
increases, in other words, when we readjust and strengthen the 
existing economic foundation and effectively utilize it while 
giving priority to the leading sectors of the national economy, 
we can have a bright prospect for constantly increasing the 
production of consumer goods. 
  Today heavy industry bases have been firmly built in our 
country. The party's economic strategic goals enable us to 
decisively resolve the problems of people's living by 
concentrating efforts on the development of agriculture, light 
industry and trade that have just as great a potential as heavy 
industry. Therefore, when we achieve the party's economic 
strategic goals, we can constantly develop all domains in 
agricultural production, including grain production, by further 
consolidating and developing socialist rural economy in our 
country. We can satisfactorily produce and supply various raw 
materials for light industry, including chemical fiber and 
synthetic fiber, by actively pushing ahead with modernization of 
light industry. As a result, all units in the light industry 
sector can produce a larger quantity of various good- quality 
consumer goods. In particular, we can provide firm export- good 
production bases by developing trade and by actively pioneering 
overseas markets. We can also better guarantee raw materials 
and materials required for enhancing the people's living 
standard by increasing production of export goods. Thus, we can 
vigorously accelerate production of consumer goods and attain 
greater achievements in all domains of agricultural production. 
Moreover, the party's economic strategic goals enable us to 
further enhance the people's living standard by concentrating 
efforts on the development of agriculture, light industry, and 
trade. The goals also enable us to achieve, ahead of schedule, 
our people's desire to eat rice food with meat soup, to wear 
silk clothes, and to live under a tile-roofed house. These 
goals make all the people fully enjoy worthwhile lives and 
happiness under the most superior our- style socialist system. 
  If we further enhance the people's living standard by 
achieving the party's economic strategic goals without fail, all 
the people will realize, from the bottom of their hearts, the 
benevolence of the great leader, and dear comrade leader who are 
making all possible efforts, and taking pains to provide them 
with a more abundant, and happier life, and will absolutely 
worship, and accept the party, and the leader. They will attain 
firmer single-hearted unity with the party, and with the leader 
[suryong] with determination to share the destiny of the leader 
[yongdoja] to the end. Besides, they will cherish more solid 
faith in, and affection of our-style socialism, which is our 
life [saengmyong], and living [saenghwal]. They will have the 
ideological and mental resolve to devotedly struggle to defend 
and glorify the grateful socialist system even at the risk of 
their life. As a result, our revolutionary ranks will be 
further strengthened into loyal ranks based on firm, unswerving 
unity between the leader [yongdoja], and people,, and our 
fatherland will prosper forever with the people's devoted 
struggle. 
  By demonstrating an indomitable sense of dedication in the 
struggle to achieve the party's revolutionary economic strategic 
goals, all functionaries, and workers should tenaciously defend 
and protect our-style socialism, and should further glorify its 
superiority.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Sang-su: "Important Issues Arising From </F>
Making Further Achievements in Electrification of Railway Lines"] 
  [Text] To solidify the material and technological 
foundation of railway lines is an important demand to guarantee 
the successful accomplishment of the party's revolutionary 
economic strategy by solving the problems in transport in a 
smooth way. One of the questions arising from this is to make 
further and better achievements in the electrification of 
railway lines. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: "It is 
necessary to complete electrifying the still-unelectrified 
sections of railway lines and to quickly introduce heavy-duty 
cars to the railway lines by producing many eight-axle electric 
locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars." 
  To make further and better gains in the achievement of 
electrification of the railway lines is one of the important 
tasks for solidifying the material and technological foundation 
of the railway lines. 
  An important factor indicating the material and 
technological 
foundation of the railway lines is railway transport capacity. 
Railway transport capacity largely depends on the kind of power 
used. 
  Electricity and internal combustion are examples of power 
sources used for railway transport. Generally speaking, the 
efficiency of steam power and internal combustion power is much 
lower than that of electricity. Therefore, to help further 
increase the proportion of usage of electric power by making 
further and better achievements gained in the electrification of 
the railway lines serves as an essential demand for solidifying 
the material and technological foundation of the railway lines. 
This can increase railway transport capacity. 
  To make further and better achievements in the 
electrification of the railway lines makes it possible to 
actively introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, thereby 
helping solidify the material and technological foundation of 
the railway lines. 
  To accelerate the introduction of heavy-duty cars into the 
railway lines is one of the ways to increase the transport 
capacity by solidifying the material and technological 
foundation of the railway lines. 
  When we introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, we 
can quickly increase the transport capacity even without laying 
many new railway lines. 
  The introduction of heavy-duty cars into the railway lines 
will increase the capacity of railway transport, and an 
important condition for this is the electrification of the 
railway lines. 
  If the haulage capacity of locomotives is low, they cannot 
properly haul heavy-duty cars. To increase the haulage capacity 
of locomotives, it is necessary to use electric power. 
  From an early day on, our party has actively pushed for the 
electrification of the railway lines by putting forth a chuche- 
oriented policy to suit the actual conditions of our country, 
which has abundant electric power resources. Under our party's 
leadership, our country has already achieved great success in 
the electrification of the railway lines. In recent years 
alone, a total of 800 km of railway lines has been electrified. 
Therefore, the main railways lines have basically been 
electrified. The feeder lines have also been electrified to a 
considerable extent. 
  When we electrify some still-unelectrified feeder lines and 
industrial lines by making further and better achievements in 
the electrification of the railway lines, we can transport more 
cargo more quickly with the existing transport means, thereby 
smoothly guaranteeing the demands for transport in the people's 
economy. 
  To increase the production of electric locomotives is a 
high- 
priority demand for making further and better achievements in 
the electrification of the railway lines. 
  Importantly, the extent railway lines have been electrified 
is indicated by the amount of cargo hauled by electric power, 
and electric locomotives are the basic means of hauling cargo in 
the electrified sections. Thus, when we increase the number of 
the electric locomotives, we can haul more cargo with electric 
power. 
  Under the party's wise leadership, when more railway lines 
have been electrified quickly, we can haul an enormous amount of 
cargo with electric power if we are equipped with more electric 
locomotives. 
  It is important to produce a proper mixture of various 
kinds of locomotives, including electric locomotives used for 
the railway lines that have not yet been electrified and the 
electric locomotives used for switching cars; as well as to give 
priority to producing more eight-axle electric locomotives used 
for hauling heavy-duty cars. When this is realized, we can 
further increase the scope and proportion of cargo hauled by 
electric power without suffering from various kinds of 
restrictions. 
  What plays a vital role in electric locomotives is the 
electric motor for power. Electric locomotives largely depend 
upon the electric motor for power. Therefore, in order to 
quickly increase the production of electric locomotives, it is 
necessary to give firm priority to the production of highly 
efficient electric motors. 
  One of the important factors to make further and better 
achievements in the electrification of the railway lines is to 
increase the supply of electricity to the electrified railway 
line sections in conformity with the practical demands. 
  At the moment, heavy-duty cars, such as the eight-axle 
electric locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars, are being 
widely introduced into railway transport in accordance with the 
policy of introducing heavy-duty cars into the railway lines; 
and a struggle to have each car haul more cargo than the haulage 
draft is being vigorously staged under the flame of "the 5.18 
no-accident, on-time, traction- standard-surpassing movement." 
This reality demands eagerly that the supply of electricity be 
further increased. To this end, it is necessary to actively 
push ahead with the construction of new intermediary electric 
power substations between the operating sections of the 
heavy-duty cars, while mapping out a series of technological 
countermeasures to increase the capacity of the existing 
electricity supply facilities. 
  The work of electrifying some still-unelectrified lines 
should be accelerated. 
  What is important here is to map out a detailed, concrete 
plan to implement a correct priority order, and to implement the 
plan in a useful fashion through the finish-one-by-one method. 
  The success of completing the electrification of some still- 
unelectrified lines largely depends upon how to lay more tracks 
and set up electric poles. Therefore, it is necessary to carry 
out the technological guidance in a substantive way so as to 
help work out a wonderful design for this and carry out the work 
in accordance with the demands of the technical regulations and 
the standard manufacturing procedure. In particular, it is 
necessary to work out a measure to secure railway tracks and 
electric poles in a foresighted way and pay special attention to 
preventing corrosion of structures caused by the electric field. 
  The work to make further and better achievements in the 
electrification of the railway lines can successfully be carried 
out only with the vigorous support from various sectors of the 
people's economy. 
  The metal industry is the sector that takes the biggest 
share 
in this support. When this sector provides, in a timely 
fashion, sufficient supply of various metal materials, including 
copper wiring, aluminum wire, silicon steel sheet, and rolled 
steel, according to the kind, quality, and gauges of those 
materials, we can increase the production of electric 
locomotives, increase the capability of electricity supply, and 
quickly push ahead with the laying of new electric railway 
tracks. 
  To make further and better achievements in the 
electrification of the railway lines is one of the important 
tasks which should be carried out in smoothly solving problems 
in transport to suit the practical demands for thoroughly 
carrying through the party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  The railway transport sector should achieve innovations in 
making further and better achievements in the electrification of 
the railway lines with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance 
and fortitude, thereby more smoothly guaranteeing the growing 
demands for transport and making active contributions to the 
implementation of the party's revolutionary economic strategy.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Inventions produced by 
Korean scientists and technicians are popular in the 
international arena. 
  Inventions of Korea was highly appraised as peculiar, rich 
in 
scientific and technical contents and very high in economic 
value at the 22nd Geneva international exhibition of inventions 
and new technique which was held some time ago. 
  Bottom paint SZ 167-KA, fingerprint access control system 
(fingerprint key) of advanced technology, meari electric 
condenser microphone "ECM-319" for professional use and 
multifunctional inoculant for production of spheroidal graphite 
cast iron which are of worldwide significance, were awarded gold 
medals and universal various gases absorbent and high 
immunogenic hepatitis B vaccine silver medals. Thus Korea took 
first place in medal winning rate. 
  Scientists and technicians and businessmen from many 
countries praised the paint of Korea, saying if it were 
introduced into shipbuilding, it would greatly contribute to 
lessening sea pollution, a knotty problem of the world. The 
fingerprint key astonished people for its speed and accuracy. 
  The high immunogenic hepatitis B vaccine has touched off a 
big stir in the global medical world. It was assessed to be 
over 10 times in efficacy the preventive medicines which had 
been manufactured by countries with developed medical science 
through the application of advanced gene engineering technology. 
It has to itself popularity in the U.N. organizations and 
international fairs. 
  More than 3,000 valuable inventions and new technical 
innovation proposals are produced every year by the Korean 
scientists and technicians who are contributing to the 
implementation of the revolutionary economic strategy of the 
Workers' Party of Korea with sciences and technologies. Many of 
them have been well received at the international exhibitions. 
  The Korean scientists and technicians exhibited over 50 
inventions and took off 44 medals at the Geneva international 
exhibition of invention and new technology sponsored by the 
world intellectual property organization under the United 
Nations. Forty of them are gold and silver medals. 
  Korea entered this organization under U.N. in 1979 and has 
displayed inventions at the exhibition almost every year from 
1980. All the inventions sent there in 1991 and 1992 took 
medals, winning great popularity. 
  The chairman of the organizing committee of the exhibition 
and the chairman of its screening committee said that Korea 
nearly made a clean sweep of medals every time and they could 
gain better knowledge of the economic power and scientific and 
technical potentiality of Korea.

  [Text] The Government has instructed all offices concerned 
to abide by the United Nations resolution on sanctions against 
Haiti's military government. 
  The Cabinet on Tuesday approved the proposal of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs to implement tough measures against the 
military regime in Haiti. As military leaders in the Caribbean 
island country have not complied with the governors' island 
agreement to restore democracy to Haiti, the UN Security Council 
on 6 May 1994 has imposed additional measures to tighten 
sanctions against Haiti. [sentence as heard] 
  According to the UN Security Council's Resolution 917, only 
humanitarian flights will be allowed to enter or pass Thai air 
space or land in Thailand. All of those involved in the 1991 
military coup in Haiti will not be allowed to enter Thailand. 
The Thai Government is also ready to freeze assets of those coup 
makers in Haiti. Trade sanctions against Haiti is also focused 
upon in the resolution banning trade ties with Haiti except for 
humanitarian purposes. [sentence as heard]

<F P=106> [By Marisa Chimprapha] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday 
welcomed a report that Australia is likely to turn down a 
request by Cambodia for weapons, saying that Thailand's position 
on the issue has been seriously taken into consideration. 
  Surin said, however, that Australia and other countries 
considering the request from Cambodia had taken their own 
positions into account when deciding on the arms request. 
  The minister was referring to a report that Canberra 
preferred to implement the promise to provide about US$2.2 
million for mine clearing and training with a separate programme 
for civil servants. 
  "Any additional assistance that we provide is likely to be 
focused on the area of training and institutional support," 
Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evens was quoted as 
saying. 
  Cambodia has sought military aid from several countries, 
including the U.S. and France to fight against the guerrillas. 
The request for the weapons coincided with the failed roundtable 
talks hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk in North Korea last month. 
  Surin said stressed that the Thai position on Cambodia's 
request to three western countries to provide weapons for the 
Cambodian government to fight the Khmer Rouge is based on its 
sincere and honest desire to see lasting peace in Cambodia. 
  "Thailand's position on the issue is not to interfere in the 
internal affairs of Cambodia. We want to deny that. Our country 
and ASEAN have long participated in helping to solve the 
Cambodian conflict, we have the right to state our position," 
Surin said. 
  Bangkok opposed the request on the grounds that more weapons 
would prolong the fighting and the ill-disciplined and unpaid 
Cambodian government troops may sell the weapons to others, even 
the Khmer Rouge. Surin had earlier said that military aid should 
focus on a training programme for civil servants. 
  Cambodia's First Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
had criticized those who opposed the request for weapons as 
interference in Cambodia's internal conflict. 
  "I am glad that Thai position on the issue was taken into 
consideration," Surin said. 
  According to Surin, the Australian Foreign Ministry's 
Permanent Secretary, Michael Costello, had explored the Thai 
position on the issue with Surin during a recent meeting. 
  "The western countries are well aware that Thailand and 
other 
ASEAN countries have taken part in solving the Cambodian 
conflict. Therefore they explored the idea and I explained the 
Thai position when asked," Surin said. 
  The U.S. and France have also sought Thai opinion on the 
issue, which has already been conveyed through the Thai 
embassies in the two countries. 
  Meanwhile, an informed source said yesterday that Son Sann, 
leader of Cambodia's Khmer People's National Liberal Front, 
during talks with Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri last month 
also voiced opposition to the request, saying that the supply of 
weapons would prolong the fighting. 
  He added that Cambodia also forwarded the request to Canada 
and Japan. 
  A Cambodian party, the Khmer Neutral Party, has appealed to 
the international community to stop military aid to Cambodia to 
end suffering, but instead provide it with financial aid to 
implement economic development. 
  The party's chairman, Buo Hel, said in a statement dated May 
23 that to overcome "this terrible reality" the Cambodian 
conflict must not be solved by military aid from foreign 
countries but by a political solution through the participation 
of all Cambodian parties at a roundtable conference. 
  "On behalf of Khmer Neutral Party I would like to make an 
appeal to the international community to cease military aid. To 
solve the problem, all factions concerned should hand full power 
to His Majesty the King Norodom Sihanouk, to decide the future 
of the country," said Buo Hel.

  [Text] China's biggest trade and investment delegation to 
ever visit Australia is continuing to generate multimillion 
dollar deals for local companies. About 500 business people, 
including 119 Chinese representatives, are today meeting at an 
investment forum in Sydney. Last week's first session of the 
forum in Melbourne resulted in 147 letters of intent worth a 
potential $1.2 billion [Australian]. Managing Director of the 
Australian Trade Commission Ralph Evans says the Chinese 
delegation has an extensive shopping list. 
  [Begin Evans recording] There were up to $10 billion worth 
of projects and that $1.2 billion on which there have been 
companies that have signed initial letters of intent represents 
12 percent of that. So, they have come with a very extensive 
shopping list and we would hope that more of it can be tapped 
into during the session here in Sydney today. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
made some progress in restarted talks on medical equipment on 
Wednesday but brushed aside the most fragile issue, a Japanese 
official said. 
  "We discussed objective criteria...mainly on qualitative 
criteria," the Finance Ministry official told reporters after 
two- day working-level talks on government procurement of 
medical equipment. 
  But he said the two sides avoided discussing quantitative 
yardsticks which led to bickering over "numerical targets" and 
ruptured the bilateral "framework" talks in February. 
  "We did not touch on talks that could cause turmoil when 
negotiations are to continue," he said, adding that the two 
sides agreed not to disclose details. 
  U.S. officials were not available for comment. 
  The two sides agreed to continue working-level talks in 
mid-June, but further adjustments are needed to decide on the 
date and place, either Tokyo or Washington, the Japanese 
official said. 
  Otherwise, "the talks got off to a smooth restart" in an 
"extremely good atmosphere," with most of the two days taken up 
by the Japanese side explaining and the U.S. side questioning 
promises made by Japan in its March market-opening package on 
government procurement, he said. 
  In the package, Japan vowed to widen the scope of products 
open to foreign firms, make specifications fairer and simpler, 
improve information available on government tenders, beef up the 
review of bidding complaints and institute comprehensive bid 
evaluations. 
  Japan also promised to review the progress of foreign goods 
procurement under these measures, apparently for use as a 
qualitative benchmark. 
  Japan and the U.S. agreed two weeks ago to restart the 
framework talks after reaching common ground on the definition 
of objective criteria that it would be both quantitative and 
qualitative yardsticks instead of numerical targets for each of 
the negotiation sectors. 
  Government procurement of medical and telecommunications 
equipment is one of the three priority areas along with 
automobile and auto parts, and insurance business. 
  Medical equipment is the last on which working-level talks 
have restarted. Telecom [telecommunications] talks were held 
separately last Friday and Saturday. 
  After a first round of resumed talks, all the three sectors 
made some progress without touching on the crucial issues, and 
the two sides agreed to continue talking.

  [Text] Washington, June 8 KYODO -- Japan told the United 
States on Wednesday [8 Jun] it has decided to shelve plans to 
authorize "reverse engineering" of computer software, a move 
that effectively removed a thorny trade issue between the two 
countries, Japanese officials said. 
  "We consider the matter as more or less settled," a Japanese 
official said after a team of Japanese officials outlined 
Japan's decision during two days of trade talks in Washington. 
  The talks, which focused on intellectual property rights 
issues, were part of the so-called "framework" trade 
negotiations the two countries reopened last week after a 
three-month deadlock. 
  The U.S. lodged a formal complaint to Tokyo last year after 
the Japanese Government launched a study on whether Japanese 
software engineers should be allowed to tinker with rival 
computer software technologies in the process of developing 
their own. The Japanese Government effectively shelved the 
"reverse engineering" initiative on May 30 when an advisory 
panel to the Cultural Affairs Agency concluded that it is 
premature for Japan to act without international consensus. U.S. 
officials "raised no objections" when the Japanese team outlined 
Tokyo's position on the reverse engineering issue, a Japanese 
official said. 
  "Reverse engineering" has emerged a highly contentious trade 
issue over patents and copyrights as computer software firms try 
to ensure compatibility of their own products by "decompiling" 
and looking into the language of commands written into a 
software product. Japanese officials contend that the issue of 
"reverse engineering" in computer software remains unresolved 
even in the U.S. as lower courts have made conflicting rulings 
on what is permissible under U.S. copyright law.

  [Text] Vienna, June 9 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Governors 
[BOG] of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has 
decided to discuss the nuclear row with North Korea on Friday 
[10 June] and major board members will reportedly submit a draft 
resolution demanding Pyongyang's nuclear transparency to the 
secretariat on Thursday, sources said. 
  Board Chairman Ronald Walker announced that the nuclear 
issue 
would be discussed at a board meeting on Friday morning as the 
last item on its agenda. 
  Representatives of the United States, Japan, France and 
other 
major board members met informally Thursday to discuss drafting 
an IAEA resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue, with an 
eye to submitting a draft to the secretariat Thursday. 
  These nations are reviewing the draft resolution's wording 
in 
a bid to get more than 20 board members to endorse it, a source 
said. 
  In the resolution, the IAEA will express concern about the 
destruction of historical records on North Korea's nuclear 
development program as a result of the stalinist state's 
unsupervised refueling of its 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, 
while demanding that Pyongyang permit special IAEA inspections 
to ensure its nuclear transparency.

<F P=106> ["Letter" from Pak Yong-nam, director of the DPRK Atomic </F>
Energy General Department to Hans Blix, director general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency -- date not given] 
  [Text] Pak Yong-nam, director of the DPRK Atomic Energy 
General Department, sent the following letter to Hans Blix, 
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA], responding to the hurriedly made conclusion that it is 
impossible to confirm if nuclear material has been diverted 
[haengmulchil yuyongul tambohalsu omnundusi sodullo kyollonul 
naeringotkwa kwallyonhaeso], insisting as if the technical 
possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods [nosim yollyo] 
at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant has been 
lost. [machi sangsildoengot chorom chujang hamyonso]. 
  I regret very much [maeu yugamsuropke saenggak handa] that 
you hurriedly made the conclusion that it is impossible to 
confirm if nuclear material has been diverted, insisting as if 
the technical possibility of the later measurement of fuel rods 
at our five- megawatt experimental nuclear power plant has been 
lost. 
  We have recently asked the agency to give us a scientific 
and 
technological response to the method for later measurement of 
fuel rods that we proposed, while agreeing to the agency's 
deputy director-general's proposal for negotiations by telex on 
the core refueling. However, you, with no intention to respond 
to our proposal, picked a quarrel with us, acting as if we had 
made no answer, and even submitted to the UN Security Council an 
absurd report that distorted facts [sasirul chondohan 
tangchiannun pogo]. 
  What we cannot help but call in question is that you ignored 
our special status following the temporary suspension of the 
effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Our special status was created 
by the United States and the IAEA. Based on their 
acknowledgement of our special status, the United States and the 
agency agreed on the inspection to guarantee the continuity of 
safeguards, and the agency has carried out inspections to 
guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not routine and ad hoc 
inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi sachari anira] under the 
safeguards accord. 
  The fuel rods replacement at the five-megawatt experimental 
nuclear power plant is being carried out in the presence of 
inspectors from the agency and under the agency's supervision 
[kamsi] and surveillance [pongswae] in accordance with this 
principle. Inspectors of the agency who are observing the 
replacement of the fuel rods admit there is no diversion of 
nuclear materials. 
  Problems on the verification of the history of the fuel rods 
[nosim yollyoui kyongnyok komjung munje] raised by the agency 
will automatically [chayonhi] be solved when our special status 
is resolved [haeso]. 
  We are now doing the refueling operations in such a manner 
to 
guarantee fully the technical possibility for later measurement 
of fuel rods, anticipating a dissolution of our special status. 
The fuel rods are being replaced channel by channel and area by 
area in due sequence, and all the fuel rods from four channels 
are discharged into one basket. 
  All the refueling operations, including recording the 
identification numbers of baskets and fuel rod channels in the 
baskets and positions of baskets in the tub, are being correctly 
recorded in accounting and operating books and are confirmed by 
the inspectors of the agency daily. This plainly shows that the 
procedure fully guarantees the possibility of repeating 
[chaeyon] the sequence of fuel channels and fuel rods in 
channels, if necessary. 
  Our method of guaranteeing the technical possibility, 
which we notified the agency by letter, is not only 
theoretically possible, but also has fully been proven 
experimentally. This is the only rational [hamnijogin] method 
suitable to our special status. All the facts show that when 
our special status is resolved, the agency can scientifically 
verify there has been no diversion of nuclear materials in the 
past. 
  Nevertheless, it was referred in your reports to the UN 
Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors that any future 
measurement of that fuel would have no practical value because 
it would not be possible to reconstruct the configuration of 
fuel rods and because the measurement would have to be based on 
operators' records, which are unverifiable. This shows that you 
seem to have no interest in a fair solution to our nuclear 
problem, in keeping with your preconceived prejudiced political 
view. 
  Our practical experience from the past inspections shows 
that 
the more we accepted the agency inspections with our maximum 
goodwill and generosity, the more artificial obstacles the 
agency made to the solution of the problem, leading the 
situation to a graver phase by attaching unreasonable conditions 
every time. 
  We made it clear during the Board of Governors meeting in 
February 1993 that the inconsistencies could be clarified by a 
verification of the fuel rods during the core refueling 
operation. At that time, however, the agency Secretariat 
objected to our proposal, saying that the inconsistencies could 
not be clarified in such a manner, and made the Board of 
Governors adopt the resolution on special inspections for two 
military sites. 
  After completing the activities sufficient to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards last March, the agency referred to the 
UN Security Council the issue of additional inspections, saying 
that it is necessary to carry out the smear-taking from the 
glove boxes and gamma mapping in the building No. 3 at the 
radiochemical laboratory in order to verify nondiversion of 
nuclear materials. 
  When we allowed the agency to conduct additional inspections 
as a special exception, it then said that it is necessary to 
measure the fuel rods from the core, which was a matter already 
denied by the agency in the past. On the one hand, the agency 
inspection team removed the archive samples for clarification of 
the inconsistencies during the past inspection, and on the other 
hand, the agency says that it is necessary for the agency to 
make special inspections of two military sites to verify 
nondiversion of nuclear materials. This shows that the agency 
Secretariat continues to join the U.S. hostile policy toward the 
DPRK to make our military sites open one by one under the 
pretext of the inspection. 
  The development of current situation regarding the core 
refueling operations bears resemblance to the IAEA's pressure 
commotion at the beginning of 1993 when the agency cooked up the 
nonexistent inconsistencies on the basis of the false 
intelligence information provided by a third country and imposed 
on us the so-called special inspection of two military sites on 
the basis of the inconsistencies. 
  I think such unreasonable acts of the IAEA are unprecedented 
events in the history of safeguards. I would like to remind you 
that, for these reasons, we could not help but withdraw from the 
NPT last year. 
  In light of the facts described above, we cannot help but 
doubt if our nuclear issue can indeed be resolved through 
further consultations with the agency Secretariat. 
  Recently, the agency Secretariat has laid obstacles to our 
normal nuclear activities concerning the refueling operation at 
the beginning of the campaign by intentionally avoiding the 
presence of its inspection team. On the other hand, it is now 
preventing a smooth solution of the nuclear problem by making a 
hasty conclusion that it could not verify the nondiversion of 
nuclear materials. This is very irresponsible and hasty behavior 
that misrepresents the objective reality. 
  Accordingly, the agency Secretariat will have to be entirely 
held responsible for all the consequence arising from this wrong 
conclusion. If the agency Secretariat takes our nuclear issue 
to the United Nations and continues to adhere to only pressure 
on the basis of a hasty conclusion that the technical 
possibility for later measurement of the fuel rods has been 
broken, widening its unfairness, we will no longer feel the need 
to be subject to the unreasonable binding of the agency 
Secretariat and will have no choice but to proceed to the next 
step of our peaceful nuclear activities.

  [Text] Vienna, June 8 KYODO -- North Korea has virtually 
finished removing fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, defying 
demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to stop 
refueling, an IAEA spokesman said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  IAEA inspectors on the spot have confirmed the situation, 
the 
spokesman said. 
  The IAEA submitted a report last week to the United Nations 
Security Council saying Pyongyang has made it impossible to 
determine whether plutonium has been secretly taken from the 
fuel rods to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  An IAEA Board of Governors regular meeting now in session in 
Vienna is expected to resume debate as early as Thursday, and is 
likely to demand that North Korea accept inspections of its two 
undeclared nuclear facilities as a possible alternative means of 
judging if it has been developing nuclear arms. 
  The undeclared sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex 90 
kilometers north of Pyongyang are suspected of being secretly 
used to develop nuclear arms. 
  North Korea has rejected the IAEA's demands to stop removing 
fuel rods from the 5-megawatt reactor, also in Yongbyon. The 
nuclear watchdog said removal would spoil chances to determine 
if plutonium has been diverted for nuclear weapons. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix said at the IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting Tuesday that it is now impossible for the U.N. 
agency to know whether North Korea is developing nuclear arms. 
  Blix also said inspections of two unreported sites suspected 
as nuclear waste facilities are now "even more important" and 
urged Pyongyang to cooperate. 
  Yun Ho-chin, North Korean delegate to the IAEA in Vienna, 
said Tuesday that North Korea will "never" allow special 
international inspections of the undeclared nuclear facilities, 
adding that the organization can carry out satisfactory 
inspections by checking the removed fuel rods.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Authorities Must Stop Suppressing Chongnyon and </F>
Koreans in Japan At Once and Apologize for it -- DPRK Foreign 
Ministry Statement --" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign 
Ministry issued a statement today denouncing the Japanese 
authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan. 
  The statement reads: 
  Japan has carried into extremes its hostile policy toward 
Chongnyon and our republic today. 
  The Japanese authorities recently committed another fascist 
outrage by sending several hundred police and raiding the Kyoto 
prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon in broad daylight and 
searching many places including houses of Chongnyon officials on 
the groundless pretext of "violation of the national land 
utilization law" in the wake of their undisguised crackdown on 
the Osaka prefectural organizations of Chongnyon in April. 
  This is part of the premeditated anti-DPRK moves the 
Japanese 
authorities committed by taking advantage of the U.S. attempts 
to isolate and stifle our republic over the "nuclear issue". It 
signifies the beginning of their wholesale suppression of 
Chongnyon. It is a grave challenge to our republic, an 
independent and sovereign state. 
  The DPRK Government strongly denounces the Japanese 
authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, 
considering it the worst human rights abuse, an illegal act of 
political repression and a typical example of their national 
chauvinistic crime. 
  Now, the Japanese authorities are running about recklessly, 
standing on the forefront of the United States' anti-DPRK 
"cooperation system". 
  They went the length of making haste with legislative 
measures for the establishment of a wartime system like 
"emergency legislature" in anticipation of "sanctions" on our 
republic, and even crying for sea blockade. 
  This is an open revelation of Japan's will to involve itself 
in another war of aggression on Korea by following the United 
States in case of emergency. 
  The entire Korean people can hardly repress resentment at 
the 
fact that Japan, which occupied Korea for nearly half a century 
and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and hardships upon it, is 
still suppressing and persecuting by means of strong arm Koreans 
in Japan, the victims of drafting by her and their descendents, 
without any justification, far from atoning for its past crimes 
through generations. 
  The Japanese authorities who have consistently pursued a 
hostile policy towards us are now intending to stage a comeback 
to our republic, joining the United States and the South Korean 
authorities in crying for "sanctions" over the "nuclear issue". 
This shows that their aggressive nature remains unchanged. 
  It is a mistake if Japan, which raked in big profits with 
the 
backing of the United States during the Korean war, expects 
another "shower of gold" in a second Korean war. 
  The time has already changed. 
  If Japan, failing to atone for the never-to-be-condoned 
crimes it had committed against the Korean people in the past, 
should take the van or be inevigled or join force in any 
"sanctions" against us, we would regard it as a declaration of 
war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment 
for it. 
  The DPRK Government and the Korean people strongly demand 
that the Japanese authorities promptly stop their suppression of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it and sternly 
punish the chief culprits in the case. 
  The Japanese authorities must immediately give up such 
foolhardy acts as pursuing a hostile policy toward our republic 
and suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. 
  We will closely follow every move of the Japanese 
authorities.

<F P=106> [By Akihiko Ota; from SANKEI SHIMBUN 8 Jun Morning Edition p </F>
5] 
  [Text] Bangkok, 7 Jun -- A diplomatic source in Phnom Penh 
disclosed 7 June to SANKEI SHIMBUN that it is most likely that 
former Cambodian Prime Minister Pol Pot, who once ruled the 
country by terror, has been hospitalized in Beijing because of 
serious illness. Officially, the former prime minister has 
retired from the front line; however, in reality, it is reported 
that he still controls the faction as its supreme leader. 
  The source got the information from a senior foreign 
ministry 
official through his friend, a French doctor, who says that a 
senior leader of the Pol Pot faction has been hospitalized in 
Beijing. 
  The source said: "Judging by the medical history and other 
information, there is no question that it is either former Prime 
Minister Pol Pot or Noun Chea, ex-chairman of the People's 
Representative Assembly." 
  Another Western diplomatic source says he has information 
that "former Prime Minister Pol Pot was first hospitalized in 
Thailand," but that, "he was later transferred to Beijing when 
his condition became more serious and the hospital was incapable 
of treating him." 
  Pol Pot took power in 1975 and ruled Cambodia till he was 
ousted in 1978 by the aggression of the Vietnamese troops. He 
has been denounced as the ruler responsible for massacring one 
million of his own people through forced labor, torture and 
execution. 
  Pol Pot has made no public appearances since 1979. However, 
it is reported he maintains a strong influence in the country. 
For example, he constantly plays a decisive role in the 
faction's conferences on important policies or operations. 
  A witness reports seeing Pol Pot during the attack by 
government troops on Pailin last March, but no confirmation has 
been made of this report. According to a military source in 
Bangkok, Pol Pot has reportedly suffered for a long time from 
heart disease.

  [Text] On 3 June, a top official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry commented on the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, and predicted: "Negotiations on all 
three priority areas will probably be concluded at the same time 
(at the Japan-U.S. summit to be held in early July)." 
  Among the three areas, negotiations on automobiles and auto 
parts have been laggard compared with progress made in the areas 
of government procurement and insurance, thus producing 
speculation that an agreement in this area will be delayed until 
sometime after July. 
  According to the top official, negotiations are now focused 
on the issue of "objective criteria" which is the common issue 
for all areas, and it has become likely that "the negotiations 
will proceed in one set" [preceding two words in English]. 
  Director-level meetings in the auto sector on 2 and 3 June 
are due to be followed by vice-ministerial talks between 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice-minister for international trade 
and industry, and Jeffrey Garten, under secretary for 
international trade, on 9 June.

  [Text] The details of Japan's proposal for objective 
criteria were disclosed on 4 June. The government will present 
the proposal in Japan-U.S. framework trade talks on government 
procurement, where the setting of objective criteria has been 
discussed as a way to gauge the openness of markets. 
  The proposal says standards should be established to assess 
efforts to increase the transparency of government procurement, 
efforts by U.S. firms to enter Japanese markets, and their 
competitiveness. It stresses that the competitiveness of 
foreign firms should be judged by such criteria as the 
difference between bidding and contract price, and not by a 
comparison of a product's market share among the other G-7 
nations, as the United States is demanding. The proposal also 
says records of procurement in each fiscal year will be used as 
a yardstick, but any increase over past figures should not be 
taken to mean "there was no increase in the past in the 
procurement of foreign products." 
  Japan and the United States agreed at unofficial 
negotiations 
in May on an "increase in competitive foreign products" as a 
target for the Japanese Government's procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. It was at the same 
meeting that the two countries decided to resume bilateral trade 
talks. The focal point of negotiations now is the assessment of 
competitiveness. 
  Washington wants to use as a standard the share of foreign 
products purchased by government procurement in other G-7 
nations, but Japan has rejected this, saying: "This would lead 
to the setting of numerical targets and violates the principle 
of giving equal treatment to both domestic and foreign products." 
  The government compiled an outline of external economic 
reforms in March. The outline says a successful bidder will be 
determined on such points as quality and performance of the 
product, as well as the bidding price for part of the government 
procurement contracts valued at more than 800,000 SDRs (special 
drawing rights; a currency used by the International Monetary 
Fund -- about 152 million yen). The proposal Japan will present 
to the United States says the assessment points and the 
difference between a foreign firm's bid and the contract price 
will help assess competitiveness. If the difference is big and 
the assessment points are low, the company will be classified as 
uncompetitive. 
  The proposal says the number of bids by foreign firms, the 
number of consultations with them before bidding, and the number 
of announcements of planned procurement bidding on the 10 most 
expensive items in the medical equipment field for national 
hospitals will serve to assess the transparency of government 
procurement. The proposal notes that Japan will work to 
increase transparency while urging U.S. firms to make efforts to 
enter Japanese markets.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroaki Ito] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 6 Jun -- With Japan-U.S. summit talks 
in Naples one month away, the U.S. Government's concrete policy 
on the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks is gradually coming 
to light. Major points of the policy are that 1) with regard to 
the number of car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles in 
Japan, the U.S. Government will seek an objective criteria in 
the form of a figure, but it will unequivocally indicate in 
writing that the objective criteria does not mean any numerical 
targets, and 2) the U.S. Government sees it as important to 
achieve certain results in the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, but it will not 
necessary seek the conclusion of a set of trade agreements on 
all sectors prior to the summit talks. The Japanese Government 
still takes the view that "setting any goals will become 
numerical targets in the end." The U.S. Government's policy is 
taken as a strategy designed to wring a "political decision" 
from the Japanese Government by indicating that the objective 
criteria does not mean a numerical target. 
  In his lecture given right after the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks resumed, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor stated 
that "the Japanese Government should promise to increase the 
number of car dealers selling foreign automobiles by a certain 
period." He made the request as an example of the objective 
criteria to measure the future openness of the Japanese vehicle 
market. The Japanese Government reacted strongly against his 
request, claiming: "What he requested means a strict numerical 
target. The government cannot tell car dealers what to do." 
  Another U.S. Government official has said: "What the 
Japanese 
Government needs to promise is not an increase in the number of 
car dealers, but the `implementation of measures' to open the 
Japanese market through the relaxation of regulations and 
transparency of transactions. I think it is better to use the 
expression 
`desirable,' or `anticipated' instead of `promise.'" In this 
way, the U.S. Government official has suggested that the U.S. 
Government is willing to compromise with the Japanese Government 
on the question of objective criteria. The U.S. Government wants 
to avoid being criticized by Japan, the American news media, the 
European Union (EU), and Asian nations for "seeking a numerical 
target." Mindful of the criticism, a high-ranking White House 
official has made it clear that "The U.S. Government will not 
care about indicating that the 'objective criteria does not mean 
any numerical target in a final agreement document.'" 
  Looking at the dispute over car dealers in Japan, there is 
no 
change in the fact, however, that "individual objective criteria 
sought by the U.S. Government is very similar to numerical 
targets," (says a Japanese Government official). The Clinton 
administration, which has made "results-oriented trade" the 
basis for its trade policy toward Japan, wants to set the 
numerical targets one way or another in the future. How to 
express that objective criteria does not mean numerical targets 
in the final agreement document will be a task for the U.S. 
Government. 
  Meanwhile, a Japanese negotiator has said: "The Japanese 
Government has promised to expand market access and sales for 
competitive foreign goods. When the U.S. Government criticizes 
Japan for not opening its market widely, the term 
`competitiveness' can be used by the Japanese Government as a 
trump card to refute the criticism. The Japanese Government will 
be able to argue with the U.S. Government about whether foreign 
goods have been competitive or not on the Japanese market." In 
this way, the official pointed to the importance of wording in 
the final agreement document.

<F P=106> [Article by Tetsuro Hasei: "Report on Unfair Trade Policies </F>
-- Argument Lacks Persuasiveness"] 
  [Text] Just as it did last year, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], in its annual "Report 
on Unfair Trade Policies" announced on 31 May, strongly 
criticized the U.S. Government for its "results-oriented" trade 
policies. The report is characterized by a harsh tone 
throughout its entirety. However, it is questionable whether 
the report's message has any persuasiveness, particularly when 
Japan is currently being harshly criticized abroad for the lack 
of openness in its markets. 
  Taking into consideration the trade policies of the 
administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, MITI took the 
trouble to include in its report a topic entitled "The Problems 
of Results-Oriented Criteria" to put up a counterargument based 
on logical reasoning against U.S. trade policies. Harsh 
expressions can be found throughout the report. For example, 
the report refers to U.S. trade policy as "tantamount to a 
single country serving both the roles of judge and prosecutor 
and lacking in due process." MITI's stance as indicated in this 
report is due to its concern that "a results-oriented way of 
thinking can easily turn into managed trade." In fact, even 
though the same problems were pointed out in last year's report, 
the Clinton administration's policies turned out to be what 
Japan had feared. For example, the Clinton administration, 
among other actions, reinstated the Super 301 provision (for 
determining and taking counteraction against unfair traders and 
trade practices) of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
Act. 
  What is emphasized as the basis of Japanese assertions is 
GATT, which Japan considers the "Constitution for International 
Trade," and the new World Trade Organization (WTO), for the 
establishment of which an agreement was concluded not so long 
ago. MITI then urges in its report to actively utilize the 
process of settling disputes through the WTO. 
  While there should be no argument against such "idealistic 
thoughts," why then are Japanese assertions hard to understand? 
Even if the primary objective of the report is not necessarily 
to point out "unfairness" in Japanese markets, it goes without 
saying that the least Japan can do to gain understanding from 
its trading partners is to show that it is not reluctant at all 
at striving to open its markets to foreign access. 
  However, the lack of openness of the Japanese markets is not 
the only problem. There have been only two instances when Japan 
took its case to GATT for review under the latter's regulations. 
In particular, when a problem arises between Japan and the 
United States, Japan resorts to bilateral negotiations rather 
than turning to international rules. It has opted for 
"ambiguous measures" as represented by the semiconductor 
agreement and voluntary restraint agreement on automobile 
exports. 
  A GATT report of investigation into trade policies has 
criticized Japan, saying "unless it is in line with the 
principle of a multilateral trade system which includes a 
nondiscriminatory rule, a bilateral settlement undermines the 
multilateral trade system itself as well as confidence in the 
system." Therefore, Japan, which has succumbed to U.S. 
pressure, cannot help but be labeled in international trade 
circles as a country that "acts contrary to its words." 
  If Japan has made changes to its previous stance, then it 
should actively try to make that known. Above all, it must show 
that through action, or else the rest of the world will not be 
convinced. Even should the logic which the report bases its 
assertions on be valid, it can be said the problem lies in how 
to carry out the policies the report advocates. 
  Otherwise, the report would only focus on counterarguments 
and tend to invite results which are contrary to its aim to 
"present a framework for bringing about constructive solutions 
to disputes due to trade frictions which often invite illogical 
confusion."

<F P=106> [Interview with Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the </F>
President for economic affairs, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
Washington correspondent Shigeru Omago; place and date not 
given; first paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] In an interview by a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter, 
Bowman Cutter, special assistant to the President for economic 
affairs, expressed hope for setting objective criteria, which 
Japan calls numerical targets, by incorporating figures for the 
future and admitted that an understanding gap exist between 
Japan and the United States. To promote discussions on this 
issue, he stressed the need to hold ministerial meetings, 
saying: "Talks should be held between Foreign Minister Kakizawa 
and U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Kantor before the end of 
June." Regarding macro policies, he expressed strong hope that 
Japan will decide by July to reduce its taxes for three years 
before making any tax increases. [Omago] Is it correct to 
assume that Japan and the United States, at the recent 
unofficial negotiations, confirmed that both countries will not 
set numerical targets, that progress in market liberalization 
shall be measured qualitatively and quantitatively by several 
objective criteria, and that the discussions' goals [kyogi] are 
to increase sales of foreign goods and services with competitive 
power in the Japanese market? 
  [Cutter] "That is right." 
  [Omago] The USTR and other government organizations made a 
proposal at negotiation meetings in individual fields, saying 
they wanted to set future numerical targets regarding the number 
of stores that sell foreign goods, and other matters. Do you 
not think this is contradictory to the agreement reached at the 
unofficial meeting? 
  [Cutter] "Such a U.S. proposal itself is not in conflict 
with the Japan-U.S. agreement. Numerical target means we set up 
specific figures as future goals and make it mandatory for Japan 
to reach these goals. However, the U.S. Government does not 
want that. Since we agreed to measure the degree of progress by 
applying several objective criteria, which will be introduced in 
each field, and not to use the degree of progress as an excuse 
to impose sanctions, I am sure we can incorporate a standard 
[kijun] regarding future figures into one of the criteria." 
  "Japan said last year that objective criteria figures must 
be 
used to measure progress made in the past because all numerical 
standards for the future are numerical targets. This is not a 
theoretic view. Because of this, we are having negotiations. 
We are not saying we need a complete agreement on this point. 
However, it is against the agreement for resumption of the 
negotiations to refuse to have discussions on this matter." 
  [Omago] There is a deep-rooted view in Japan that the USTR 
is taking the leadership for negotiations in the United States. 
  [Cutter] "I do not think we should separate the USTR from 
other U.S. Government departments. Policies, even in the field 
where the USTR is acting as a contact point for negotiations, 
are determined by National Economic Council (NEC) secretarial 
meetings . USTR Kantor is one of the top VIP's, if I may name 
one. However, the final decisions are made by NEC secretaries, 
including Rubin, special assistant to the President, USTR 
Kantor, Finance Secretary Bentsen, and Tyson, Council of 
Economic Advisers chairwoman." 
  [Omago] Some people in Japan think they can accept the idea 
of setting objective criteria for foreign companies' procurement 
shares only in the government procurement field. What do you 
think of this? 
  [Cutter] "This is news to me. I have been talking to 
Assistant USTR Barshevsky, who is in charge of government 
procurement. I am sure she does not know about that either, and 
we have not heard any proposals in this regard. However, it is 
a good sign if there is such a proposal. It will be extremely 
beneficial." 
  [Omago] Can you comment on macroeconomic policies? 
  [Cutter] "Both Japan and the United States made record of 
the fact that Tsutomu Hata, then deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, explained to USTR Kantor at Marrakech in 
Morocco a plan designed to cut taxes for three years before 
making tax increases. This is a very important decision (aimed 
at a significant reduction of Japan's current account balance). 
We understand that Japan's political situation is in a state of 
confusion. This does not mean, however, that Japan does not 
have to come up with new macro policies in time for the 
developed nations' summit talks in July (Naples summit)." 
  [Omago] Are you aiming to reach mutual accords on all 
three priority areas -- government procurement, insurance, and 
auto and auto parts -- before the summit? 
  [Cutter] "Ideally, yes. But, the reality is that we are not 
setting a deadline. We will be satisfied if we can check the 
discussions' progress, which are incorporated in last July's 
original agreement between the top leaders of Japan and the 
United States. There is no need for us to reach accords on all 
three fields prior to the summit." 
  [Omago] Are the next deputy ministerial talks going to be 
held? 
  [Cutter] "We would like to see, for a little while, how the 
situation develops. Foreign Minister Kakizawa and USTR Kantor 
will meet in Paris next week and ..." [ellipses as received] 
  [Omago] I am sure Foreign Minister Kakizawa will not be able 
to go to Paris because the Diet is now in session. 
  [Cutter] "That is news to me too. It was Foreign Minister 
Kakizawa's idea, so we were hoping the meeting would be held. 
They should hold a meeting even if they are not able to meet in 
Paris. If their meeting is held by the end of June, we will be 
able to pave the way for subsequent negotiations."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "For the Report's Indication of `Trade Barriers' </F>
To Be Persuasive"] 
  [Text] It is difficult to maintain the free trade system 
with ordinary efforts. When we read the 1994 report on unfair 
trading practices, we feel this sharply. 
  The report was compiled by a subcommittee of the Industrial 
Structure Council (an advisory body to the minister of 
international trade and industry). The Industrial Structure 
Council [ISC] surveyed 10 nations and region, including the 
United States and the European Union (EU), that are Japan's 
major trading partners to determine whether those nations and 
regions adopt unfair trading policies and how unfair those 
trading policies are. This year, the ISC surveyed China and 
Taiwan, too. As its highlight, the report calls on Japan's 
major trading partners to address their unfair trading practices. 
  The report's analysis is clear-cut. The report uses accords 
of the GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to 
be founded under a new multilateral agreement, and international 
trade rules as criteria for determining whether trade policies 
adopted by those nations and regions are fair or not. 
  The report points out to Japan's major trading partners 
rather than accusing them one-sidedly. Noting that there are 
trade barriers in many nations including Japan, the report urges 
those nations to work cooperatively together to remove them. 
  The basis for the report's analysis is undisputable and we 
agree with many points the report advocates. The report proposes 
that trade frictions be settled by multilateral arbitrations in 
accordance with international trade accords. We agree with the 
report's proposal. 
  The question is whether the report is persuasive or not. 
  This spring, the EU abolished its long-standing 
discriminatory measures against and quantitative restrictions on 
Japan. South Korea also has abolished discriminatory measures 
against Japanese material patents, including medicine, and the 
country is now moving toward halving its quantitative 
restrictions on Japan. 
  How about the United States? Of 13 sectors surveyed, the 
report identifies that the United States still keeps trade 
barriers in place in 10 sectors, an increase of one sector over 
a year earlier, through quantitative restrictions, subsidies and 
antidumping measures. 
  There was some improvement last year. To site an example, 
Japan ended its voluntary restraint on the export of automobiles 
and machine tools to the American market at the request of the 
United States. 
  Meanwhile, the United States unilaterally imposed 
countervailing tariffs on steel products exported by the EU and 
enacted a protectionist law governing the standard and 
certification system for imported automobiles. Last year, the 
United States revived the Super 301 Provision which allows the 
administration to unilaterally slap sanctions against U.S. 
trading partners. This is a matter of the greatest concern. 
  The U.S. market still has plenty of affluence and 
potentiality although the U.S. economic power is said to have 
been waned. The U.S. market is widely open and highly 
transparent. It is easy to gain access to it. Both industrial 
nations and developing countries therefore are aiming to gain 
access to it. 
  Japan has a huge amount of trade surplus with the United 
States. How much did the package of measures serve to address 
the trade imbalance between the two countries? Although it is 
said that both Japan and the United States need to make 
concerted efforts to address their trade imbalance, we cannot 
help but say that Japan's speedy measurers are crucial in 
balancing the bilateral trade. 
  If Japan, whose economic power ranks second in the world 
following the United States, opens its market and expands its 
domestic demand, this would reinforce the credibility of the 
report's objective and detailed verifications. 
  The report stresses the need to fully use the accord on the 
WTO, which is to be founded in January 1995, in accordance with 
a multilateral agreement hammered out at the multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round), but prospects for this are not 
necessarily optimistic. The Diet in Japan and the Congress in 
the United States have yet to deliberate the accord for 
ratification. 
  Japan needs to speedily defuse the trade friction with the 
United States and to work vigorously to get the WTO inaugurated. 
Japan should not let the United States rush to protectionism.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] In response to U.S. Commerce Undersecretary 
Garten's remarks calling on Japan to let American companies 
access its Official Development Assistance (ODA)-related 
projects, concerned ministries, including the Foreign Ministry, 
are wondering what the United States really wanted to say. 
Government officials doubt that the United States sees projects 
under Japan's ODA -- which reaches approximately $11 billion a 
year -- as business chances and hopes to win those projects by 
making business activities or whether it wants to secure a 
certain share of ODA projects in a manner similar to the one it 
took in economic framework talks with Japan. 
  Speaking at a 2 June news conference, Undersecretary Garten, 
who is scheduled to visit Japan starting 5 June, said: 
"Although Japan says that most of its ODA is untied -- which 
means that the purchase of material to be used for ODA projects 
is open to foreign companies -- current business opportunities 
for foreign companies are limited." An untied percentage of 
Japan's ODA in fiscal 1993 is 96.9 percent. Of this, the 
purchase of materials from the United States accounts for about 
5 percent. It is apparent that the United States, who maintains 
there is less chance for American companies to take part in ODA 
projects, bases its demand on such a low percentage. 
  The Foreign Ministry counterargues, saying: "Since the 
international open bidding system has been introduced to ODA 
projects, even the percentage of orders received by Japanese 
companies has dropped to about 30 percent. This is because ODA- 
receiving countries' and their neighboring nations' competitive 
power in bidding has increased, and the United States is not 
treated unfavorably" (according to the Economic Cooperation 
Bureau). 
  The Foreign Ministry says that when a contract on yen loans 
is concluded with certain countries, it sends English-translated 
documents showing details of the contract to each foreign 
embassy in Tokyo. The ministry stresses: "A company's 
receiving an order depends on how much effort it has made." 
  Concerning Commerce Undersecretary Garten's remarks, some 
within the government show an optimistic view, saying: "He must 
have made the remarks just in hopes of opening up a new, 
attractive ODA- related market and encouraging American 
companies to make further efforts." 
  However, Undersecretary Garten might have made the remarks 
with an eye to pointing out alleged unfair transactions between 
an ODA- receiving government and contractors because the United 
States has strongly called on other industrialized nations to 
sweep away suspicion that companies from industrialized nations 
win a contract by sending bribes to an ODA-receiving country. 
  Attention is increasingly focused on how Undersecretary 
Garten carries his point in meetings with Japanese officials and 
business leaders. Although the Japanese Government says its 
ODA-related projects are "fair and transparent," the U.S. may 
step up the offensive depending on negotiations.

  [Text] Speaking at a press conference on 6 June in 
connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
development, Vice Foreign Minister Saito indicated there was 
still a possibility that negotiations would be held between 
North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
depending on the next move by Pyongyang. 
  Saito said: "The IAEA's report says 'North Korea's overall 
cooperation is necessary to satisfactory inspections.' This 
means that the possibility of conducting inspections by other 
means has not been eliminated." 
  He cited special inspections of two nuclear-related 
facilities which have not been filed for inspection as potential 
"other ways" in which inspections might be carried out.

  [Text] It has been disclosed that banks in developed 
nations increased their loans to North Korea last year despite 
the heightened tension over the DPRK nuclear issue. It is said 
in international financial circles that loans to the DPRK entail 
a high risk that principal and interest will not be paid. Thus, 
a financial source wondered "why loans to the country increased 
last year." 
  According to the same source, loans from developed nations' 
banks, which are obliged to report to the Bank for International 
Settlements, increased their credit to North Korea by $45 
million in 1993, and the amount outstanding at the end of the 
year was $492 million. Loans to the DPRK were on the decline 
between 1990 and 1992 because of the country's flagging economy, 
but the figures for 1993 show that this trend has changed. 
  Concerning Japanese banks' credit to North Korea, the source 
said: "The figure is not zero, but it accounts for less than 5 
percent of overall loans provided by Western banks to North 
Korea." The balance of loans from Japan to the DPRK remains 
almost the same, because only loans Japanese banks provided in 
the past remain unpaid. This indicates that Japanese credit to 
the DPRK is not a cause for the increase. 
  According to Euromoney, a British financial magazine, North 
Korea ranks 157th in a (March) country-risk list (which shows 
degrees of risk in providing loans). Despite this, loans to the 
country increased in 1993. Some people think that "short-term 
loans related with trade between North Korea and developed 
nations may be increasing."

  [Text] At a 5 June news conference in Fukuoka city, 
Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono commented on the 
trilateral talks among Japan, the United States, and the ROK on 
the DPRK's suspected nuclear development program. He said: "I 
hope the three countries will fully discuss measures to have a 
UN resolution adopted." 
  His remark indicates that he is opposed to the government's 
positive stance on a plan for Japan, the United States, and 
South Korea to independently impose sanctions on North Korea if 
the UN Security Council fails to adopt a resolution calling for 
sanctions.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yasuo Okumura: "Economic Sanctions </F>
Against North Korea -- China's Moves Are the Focal Point"] 
  [Text] With the United States, South Korea, and Japan 
affirming their concerted action to deal with the issue of North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, the UN 
Security Council is expected to carry out full-fledged 
discussions on ways to impose sanctions on the DPRK unless North 
Korea relents. China, which holds the key to economic 
sanctions, is still taking a position against economic sanctions 
while distancing itself from those nations. How will the 
economic sanctions be dealt with in the future? Will the 
economic sanctions be effective without China participating in 
them? 
  As is seen in the DPRK's past diplomacy, North Korea has 
frequently changed its stand, and the possibility still remains 
that North Korea will seek compromise through dialogue. If the 
United Nations is to impose economic sanctions on North Korea or 
a group of nations is to impose them, they will adopt the method 
in which economic sanctions were imposed on South Africa and 
Iraq. The economic sanctions are primarily aimed at halting the 
flow of "money," "goods," and "personnel." Measures considered 
to be effective as part of economic sanctions are a trade 
embargo, a ban on capital transactions, a freeze on assets and 
means of payment, and the halt of remittances to the DPRK by 
ethnic Koreans residing in Japan. 
  North Korea's trade with China, Russia, and Japan accounts 
for more than 60 percent of its total trade. The DPRK's imports 
from the three nations account for 73 percent of its total 
imports. 
  North Korea has increased its dependence on China for its 
imports of energy resources such as oil and coke since the 
Soviet Union disintegrated. The DPRK's imports of energy 
resources from China make up 80 percent to 90 percent of its 
total imports. In particular, North Korea imported 1.006 
million tons of oil from China in 1992. The DPRK, which is a 
state of economic devastation, is suffering from a sharp fall in 
its food self-sufficiency rate. North Korea has boosted grain 
imports from China since 1991, and its grain imports from China 
account for nearly 80 percent of its total grain imports. North 
Korea imported 650,000 tons of grain from China in 1992. 
  If China abstains from voting or exercises its right to veto 
the economic sanctions at the UN Security Council, the 
effectiveness of the economic sanctions is expected to be very 
low. There is also a question of how to block the flow of goods 
into North Korea through third nations. While the United States 
is continuing its efforts to garner international support for 
the economic sanctions, China is still taking a position against 
economic sanctions being imposed on the DPRK. 
  Commenting on China's recent moves, a diplomatic source 
said, 
"It is highly possible that China will seek to maintain the 
status quo and refuse to join other nations in imposing economic 
sanctions." In explaining the reasons for China taking such a 
stand, the same diplomatic source said: 1) If economic 
sanctions cause the Kim Il- song regime to collapse, China would 
be flooded with a huge number of Korean refugees; 2) If the DPRK 
is absorbed by South Korea, the United States would then extend 
its influence to the Yalu River (the Chinese-North Korean 
border), and it is conceivable that a unified Korea will inherit 
North Korea's nuclear development program; and 3) The DPRK's 
development of nuclear weapons would not only pose a threat to 
China but would also give Japan an excuse to arm itself with 
nuclear weapons [point 3 as published]. 
  In order to avoid facing this situation, China has no choice 
but to take a stand against the economic sanctions that could 
pave the way for North Korea's collapse. China's calculation is 
that if it joins other nations in imposing economic sanctions, 
this would harm its economy. 
  Will the economic sanctions be ineffective if China does not 
join other nations in imposing them? 
  Mr. Masaki Yabuuchi, a member of the China and North Asia 
task force in the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), has 
said otherwise: "Even if China does not join other nations in 
imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK, the sanctions will 
gradually have an effect. If Western nations such as Japan, 
Germany, and Australia stop their exports of machine tools, 
transportation equipment, and other products to North Korea, the 
export embargo will force the DPRK to halt its construction 
projects and will make that country unable to retain its 
production capabilities in the long run, even though these 
sanctions will not generate immediate effects, as would oil 
sanctions. The economic sanctions will slowly affect North 
Korea economically."

<F P=106> [Interview with Hiteshi Takesata, chief of the First </F>
Research Office of the Second Research Department in the 
Japanese Defense Agency's National Institute for Defense 
Studies, by Foreign Affairs Department reporter Bumigo Ozawa; 
place and date not given -- first paragraph is MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
introduction] 
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began 
holding a session of its Board of Governors in Vienna on 6 June, 
and high on the agenda of the session is the issue of North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN Foreign Affairs Department reporter Bumigo Ozawa has 
interviewed Hiteshi Takesata, chief of the First Research Office 
of the Second Research Department of the Defense Agency's 
National Institute for Defense Studies on the present state of 
and prospects for the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons. 
  [Ozawa] Why is North Korea so hastily removing fuel rods 
from 
its experimental (five-megawatt) nuclear reactor at Yongbyon? 
  [Takesata] North Korea is doing so because it is actually 
hastening the development of nuclear weapons. There is an 
argument that the DPRK has suffered a loss of prestige because 
it has been criticized for developing nuclear weapons although 
it has not actually engaged in developing them. I do not agree 
with this argument. North Korea has refused to give IAEA 
inspectors access to the removal of the fuel rods at the expense 
of resuming high-level U.S.-DPRK talks, and this is evidence 
that the country is developing nuclear weapons. 
  [Ozawa] At what stage is North Korea's development of 
nuclear 
weapons? 
  [Takesata] The DPRK is said to have extracted plutonium from 
the experimental nuclear reactor in question, and the plutonium 
is enough to build one or two atomic bombs. Once North Korea 
extracts weapons-grade materials from the experimental nuclear 
reactor, the next stage is to develop detonation devices for 
atomic bombs and technology to miniaturize the atomic bombs. 
According to a South Korean defense white paper, in North 
Korea, about 70 craters have been found where detonation devices 
are believed to have been tested. The DPRK has provided Iraq 
with missile technology and has the technology to assemble 
MiG-29 fighter jets. Given these technological capabilities, 
North Korea is close to building nuclear weapons. 
  [Ozawa] Is there any relation between North Korea's 
development of nuclear weapons and the present situation of that 
country? 
  [Takesata] The power base of Secretary Kim Chong-il, the 
heir 
apparent to President Kim Il-song, is not as solid as is his 
father's. Secretary Kim Chong-il has no experience in fighting 
against the Japanese, and this lack of experience is a fatal 
blow to him in terms of his assuming power in North Korea. The 
development of nuclear weapons is a means to make up for this 
lack. Perhaps the DPRK aims to earn foreign currency by 
exporting nuclear weapons. 
  [Ozawa] What effect will economic sanctions have against 
North Korea? 
  [Takesata] It is difficult for the United Nations to adopt a 
resolution imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK because it is 
believed that China would veto the resolution. Some take the 
view that there has been a change in China's policy toward North 
Korea, but there is no change in its stand against the economic 
sanctions. If China exercises its right of veto to block the 
United Nations from adopting the resolution, this would create 
an irreversible situation for the Clinton administration, which 
has renewed most- favored-nation trading status for China. The 
United States will withdraw the resolution when it finds that 
China will certainly exercise its right of veto. Any economic 
sanctions imposed by Japan, the United States, and South Korea 
would be 80 percent ineffective. On the contrary, the economic 
sanctions would prompt North Koreans to unite. The economic 
sanctions must be viewed as a necessary means for a diplomatic 
"settlement" to the issue. 
  [Ozawa] Is there any possibility that North Korea will 
compromise with the international community in the future? 
  [Takesata] The DPRK aims to resume high-level talks with the 
United States. North Korea will put forward a compromise 
proposal at the talks, and the United States will accept it. 
There is a possibility that the United States will shift to a 
policy under which it will not make an issue of North Korea's 
development of nuclear weapons and will seek a pledge from the 
DPRK that it will not sell nuclear weapons to other countries. 
With midterm elections soon to be held in the United States and 
an international conference scheduled to be held next year to 
discuss the question of extending the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT), the issue of North Korea's suspected development 
of nuclear weapons is likely to continue to remain deadlocked 
for the time being.

<F P=106> [Article by Shunji Taoka of AERA editorial staff: </F>
"Demonstration of Military Power Will Adversely Affect 
Negotiations With the United States"] 
  [Text] Because of a tipoff from the United States at the 
end of May that there were signs North Korea (DPRK) would 
shortly test launch a ballistic missile, those in charge of 
North Korean affairs at the Defense Agency and Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs became excited. 
  Approximately one year has passed since the test launching 
on 
29 May 1993 of the prototype No. 1 of Nodong-1 with a reputed 
range of 1,000 km. Since then, a second test launching has not 
been conducted. 
  To develop missiles, scores of test launchings are usually 
required to discover defects and improve reliability before they 
are mass produced and deployed. If not, they will not work with 
precision and it is doubtful whether they will hit the intended 
targets after the launch buttons are pressed. 
Is the "Rimpac" Exercise of Japan, the United States, and the 
ROK in Mind? [subhead] 
  A U.S. reconnaissance satellite detected that several 
containers had been taken to the missile launching site on the 
east coast of North Korea and a launcher installed. A giant 
shelter pad against propellant jets had been erected and the 
brisk activities of North Korean warships were also noted. 
  But, what was launched on the morning of 31 May was 
different: It was a conventional Chinese-made antiship Silkworm 
missile. It is so named because of its green caterpillar shape 
which resembles a silkworm. 
  It was a missile of 80 to 90 km range intended mainly to 
defend coastal areas from enemy landing operations. Although it 
was reported that a new type of missile mounted with improved 
guidance apparatus was tested, Japanese intelligence experts 
seemed to lose interest, saying: "Why, it is a Silkworm." 
  At about the same time, the United Nations Security Council 
adopted a presidential statement demanding North Korea stop 
pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and 
have it inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 
reaction, North Korea insisted that there is no need to allow 
full inspections as the DPRK has a unique status since it 
proclaimed its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and then withheld its intentions to do 
so. It publicly stated that if economic sanctions were applied 
it would be deemed a declaration of war. 
  If war breaks out, the U.S. and ROK Navies will have 
complete 
command of the sea, and the U.S. Third Marine Division on 
Okinawa and two ROK Marine divisions will be able to threaten 
the flanks and rear of the DPRK forces by landing on the North 
Korean coast. "Rimpac 94," a joint naval exercise of Japan, the 
United States, the ROK, Canada, and Australia, is under way in 
the Pacific and the DPRK surely feels the menace of awesome 
naval power demonstrated by that exercise. 
  To show the posture that it will not yield to such threats 
and it is ready to intercept any landings, the DPRK may have to 
test launch what little antiship missiles it has or conduct 
training in the laying of mines. But, this sort of bullying 
attitude will by and large have an adverse affect on the 
Americans. 
  If a soft and pliant attitude is taken to satisfy American 
pride, the DPRK may attain its objective of holding high-level 
U.S.-DPRK talks; of obtaining power generating facilities 
through light water reactors which are difficult to use for 
military purposes; and of obtaining economic assistance from 
both Japan and the United States. On the contrary, the 
demonstration of military power, however small, will make the 
U.S. response difficult. 
"Nodong" Missile Development May Be At a Standstill [subhead] 
  As for Japan, antiship missiles are no threat at all. 
Whether the development of Nodong-1 or its improved type 
Nodong-2 is continuing is what matters. Attention is focused on 
whether test launchings are due shortly or not. 
  The reason why a Nodong-1 test has not been conducted for 
more than a year is attributed to the North Korean practice that 
"the DPRK has conducted quite a few tests on domestically 
developed and produced Scud B and C missiles." This way, 
missiles for practical use cannot be produced. 
  Scud C's and Nodong-l's are said to have been developed for 
export during the Iran-Iraq war with orders being placed and 
development funds provided by Iran. And, at the test launch 
last May, an Iranian delegation was invited to attend. But at 
present, Iran is in financial difficulty because of low 
petroleum prices and it has little reason to purchase North 
Korean-produced missiles. 
  There are strong signs that the Japanese Government has 
applied pressure: "How can Iran provide money for development 
of missiles by none other than North Korea" in view of the fact 
that Iran is receiving economic assistance from Japan. 
  If the DPRK abandons the development of ballistic missiles 
with a possible range reaching Japan on top of the fact that it 
has a very weak air force, Japan will feel almost no threat at 
all.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The UNSC Should Not Make Hasty Arguments on </F>
Sanctions"] 
  [Text] Just like a stone rolling down a steep hill, 
arguments over the DPRK's suspected nuclear development program 
are rapidly moving towards the issuing of a warning by the 
United Nations Security Council [UNSC] and the imposition of 
phased sanctions on North Korea. This is a very serious 
situation. 
  First of all, North Korean leaders should stop using its 
"fuel rod card" but should comply with a call by the UNSC, which 
in a presidential statement issued at the end of May asked 
Pyongyang to remove and store fuel rods in such a way as to 
enable the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
accurately assess them in the future. 
  Pyongyang has asserted that "we have extracted 
experimentally 
only a very small amount (about 90 gm) of plutonium from broken 
fuel rods." Fuel rods are real evidence that enables the IAEA 
to ascertain whether or not Pyongyang's assertion is true. 
  North Korea is holding up its decision to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Using this "special 
position," it has rejected regular inspections of fuel rod 
removal. Pyongyang has also asserted that if the nuclear issue 
is resolved at a third round of high-level talks with the United 
States, it will allow the IAEA to inspect the discharge of fuel 
rods. 
  The IAEA, which does not approve of the DPRK's "special 
position," initially called for inspections of the ongoing 
discharge of fuel rods. Recently, the agency appears to have 
backed down from that position. It now proposes that Pyongyang 
should at least promote work to remove fuel rods in accordance 
with IAEA standards in the future. It can be said that the 
agency has made the proposal in consideration of North Korea's 
"special position." 
  After the UNSC issued a presidential statement in May, a 
councilor at the North Korean Embassy in Australia reportedly 
told Western correspondents that although Pyongyang could not 
stop the work to remove fuel rods, it stored sets of 40 
discharged fuel rods in a storage pool after attaching a plate 
showing each rod's location inside the reactor and its serial 
number. Moreover, he reportedly said that although the IAEA was 
demanding the storing of every 10 fuel rods as one set, this was 
a technical matter and that there was no big difference in 
opinion about it. 
  If what he has said is true, and if Pyongyang has no 
intention of destroying evidence, the DPRK should not be hung up 
on the "technical matter." 
  We hope that the UNSC will exercise prudence. The recent 
uproar caused by the discharge of fuel rods has increased 
suspicion over the DPRK's nuclear program. But at the present, 
it is no more than suspicion. What has been questioned is 
whether or not North Korea has extracted weapons-grade plutonium 
from spent fuel rods. However, removed fuel rods are put under 
IAEA supervision, so they will not be diverted to a military 
program. 
  It is believed that India, Pakistan, and Israel have 
promoted 
the development of nuclear weapons, or that they already have 
them. As such, there are potential nuclear powers in the world. 
Unlike the DPRK, these countries are not obliged to accept 
nuclear inspections and not subject to sanctions because they 
are not NPT members. 
  If economic sanctions are imposed on an NPT member over 
suspicion of its nuclear program, this will discourage other 
countries from joining the NPT. 
  If North Korea withdraws from the NPT as a result of 
economic 
sanctions, it will become impossible for Pyongyang to realize 
its wish to normalize relations with the United States. But at 
the same time, the DPRK will be free from the obligation to 
submit to nuclear inspections. From the broad view of 
maintaining and expanding the NPT system, a hasty decision on 
economic sanctions should be avoided. We should not forget that 
it is ordinary people who suffer from sanctions. 
  There is still hope that this nuclear issue will be resolved 
peacefully through dialogue. When the UNSC issued a 
presidential statement at the end of March to call on North 
Korea to accept additional nuclear inspections, Pyongyang 
"flatly rejected" it. However, in May, the country expressed a 
strong desire to settle the issue at high-level talks with the 
United States through the acceptance of additional inspections. 
Now is a very critical moment for dialogue diplomacy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Dangerous To Push North Korea Too Far"] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK has been using various kinds of "nuclear 
cards" for over a year. It was believed to have only two or 
three cards but actually, it has shown us many different cards 
one after another. The international community was thrown into 
confusion every time North Korea used a new card. Although 
North Korea is running out of cards, those left, such as 
"withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)" and 
"declaration of nuclear arms possession," threaten security in 
the international community. To prevent the DPRK from resorting 
to these dangerous cards, the only way left for us is not to 
uselessly apply pressure on it but to try to persistently 
persuade it. 
  North Korea's primary object was to draw out compromises 
from the United States by using "the nuclear card." Since the 
nuclear cards are used to draw attention from the international 
community while mystifying the actual condition of nuclear arms 
development, the DPRK will eventually fall into 
self-contradiction if it uses them too many times. Such a 
contradiction became apparent over the issue of experimental 
reactor fuel rod inspection. 
  It is still uncertain whether North Korea, whose mask was 
about to be torn off, will insist on wearing it to the end, or 
it will finally reveal its face by compromising at the last 
moment. 
  The point at issue is how long can the patience of the 
international community last in dealing with this nation. UN 
Security Council member nations started consultations on 3 June 
and Japan-U.S.-ROK consultations have also begun in Washington. 
  The United States has so far maintained a comparatively 
cautious stance with regards to negotiating with North Korea. 
The United States has been maintaining the stance that it will 
not fuss about the past and be satisfied if it can apply the 
breaks to the DPRK's future nuclear development. 
  However, the story is different if thorough inspections 
cannot be carried out on fuel rods taken from the experimental 
reactor. Making a complete change, the United States now thinks 
that strong measures, such as economic sanctions, should be 
taken against North Korea. The United States' only goal is to 
prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons, because even if the 
situation on the Korean peninsula or in northeastern Asia 
becomes confused, it would not become a direct threat to 
security in the United States. 
  However, the situation will be different for neighboring 
nations of North Korea. They will be directly affected. For 
example, refugees may flow into these countries. The United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have 
played a major role in the negotiations held so far with North 
Korea. But depending on future development regarding the North 
Korean issue, opinions and efforts of Japan, China, and the ROK, 
which are North Korea's neighbors, aimed at settling the issue 
will become more important than before. 
  What draws public attention at this point is China's 
position 
on persuading North Korea. China, which insists that the issue 
should be settled through discussions, must exert its 
influential power now. 
  Meanwhile, Japan should not give up, even if "North Korea 
hangs up whenever Japan calls them," but try through various 
channels to hold direct talks with the DPRK. 
  As for the inspection of fuel rods, the IAEA has concluded 
that it is now impossible to conduct the inspection. However, 
there is still room for discussions to find a way to break the 
current deadlock. 
  Nothing could be better if economic sanctions are avoided. 
The United Nations, if it has no choice but to impose sanctions 
because of North Korea's stubborn attitude, should do its best 
to obtain consensus from its member nations, including China and 
Russia. Moreover, sanctions should be imposed in stages and we 
must be careful that the international community will not drive 
North Korea into a tight corner.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "How Should We Deal With North Korea?"] </F>
  [Text] How should the international community deal with 
the DPRK (North Korea), which has taken actions that can be 
interpreted as destruction of evidence of its suspected nuclear 
arms development program by going ahead with changing fuel rods 
at its experimental reactor? 
  In their meetings in Washington, Japan, the United States, 
and South Korea agreed to call on the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
to study measures against North Korea, including possible 
economic sanctions. The UNSC will start full-scale discussions 
on the matter on 6 June. 
  The United States has formally announced that the rationale 
for holding the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks has 
ceased to exist. At this meeting, not only the nuclear issue, 
but also improvement of U.S.-DPRK relations were supposed to be 
discussed. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton implicitly urged 
North 
Korea to accept special inspections to avoid economic sanctions 
-- special inspections meaning the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) conducting inspections of two facilities which 
North Korea has refused to list in its report. This action is 
the only way left to resolve the question of the suspected 
nuclear arms development program. 
  North Korea countered this, declaring it will regard 
implementation of economic sanctions as a declaration of war. 
Furthermore, North Korea has hinted at the possibility of 
formally withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) -- something which the country has temporarily withheld 
from doing -- and demanded all matters be resolved in one 
package at high-level U.S.-DPRK talks. 
  Our goal on the North Korean nuclear issue is clear: It is 
to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons to pave the way for 
global peace and to have North Korea abandon its nuclear 
development program. To do so, nuclear suspicions must be 
cleared up through complete inspections by the IAEA. 
  Five permanent member nations of the UNSC as well as Japan, 
South Korea, and an overwhelming majority of nations in the 
international community share this view. 
  The problem is how to achieve it. We must be calm and 
realistic. It goes without saying that the best way is to settle 
the problem peacefully is through dialogue. 
  However, past experience has shown that tenacious efforts 
for 
holding dialogue alone cannot produce results. In fact, current 
conditions stem from North Korea's negative stand of trying to 
continuously cause problems. 
  Imposing sanctions on North Korea itself is not our goal. It 
should be avoided if possible. But with the situation having 
come to where it has, there is no choice but to start studying 
full-scale sanctions at the United Nations. At this point, 
China's role of persuading North Korea is most important, while 
the only way left to avert sanctions will be for North Korea to 
accept special inspections. 
  What the UNSC should do is first pass a resolution warning 
North Korea that it is willing to implement sanctions if 
necessary, while watching the situation closely. And if North 
Korea still does not change its position, the UNSC has no choice 
but to make a move toward implementation of sanctions. Taking 
North Korea's behavioral pattern into consideration, the UNSC 
must make the international community's determination clear and 
leave no doubt. 
  If North Korea withdraws from the NPT and goes on with 
development of nuclear weapons, it must be prepared for the 
possible consequence of its national governing system sooner or 
later being destroyed by the effects of sanctions. It is 
necessary to make the DPRK leadership realize that all its 
efforts up to now will go down the drain. The soft-line 
position alone is unlikely to be enough to change North Korea's 
brinkmanship policy. 
  In case sanctions are taken, it is desirable for them to be 
done within the framework of the United Nations. But depending 
on what China with its veto right decides to do, there may be no 
other choice but to think about the possibility of taking 
actions outside the UN framework, led by Japan, the United 
States, and South Korea. 
  There is a possibility that North Korea will resort to an 
adventuristic course of action. Japan's concerns dwell on 
possible contingencies of sabotage operations occurring in the 
country or refugees flooding in. The crisis management system 
needs to be improved without delay. 
  The DPRK problem is also a threat to Japan's security. We 
must overcome the situation and dissipate such a threat through 
concerted action under the United Nations, and also in close 
cooperation among Japan, the United States, and South Korea if 
necessary.

  [Text] Discussions on imposing sanctions on the DPRK (North 
Korea) over the nuclear arms development issue have suddenly 
assumed a realistic edge. On 6 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata stressed once again the government's stand of seeking a 
peaceful settlement, saying that "even if the situation becomes 
tense, we have to remain calm." But, Japan will have no choice 
but to make a political decision if the United States changes 
its mind and adopts a hard- line stand. Nevertheless, concerned 
ministries and agencies, which are trying to map out concrete 
measures to deal with possible scenarios, are hesitating to do 
what they have to do because complicated factors are involved in 
the issue, including "the Constitution," "human rights," and 
"the past." It is possible that depending on how things develop 
in the future, the issue may have a serious impact on the 
political situation in Japan. Therefore, we can say that the 
DPRK issue has reached a delicate stage. 
  On 6 June, the government was busy dealing the North Korean 
issue. In the afternoon of the same day, Deputy Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Nobuo Ishihara chaired a "Joint Information Council" 
meeting, which was attended by each ministry's responsible 
officials, including the International Bureau chief of the 
Foreign Ministry and the chief of the Defense Agency's Bureau of 
Defense Policy. In the evening, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, and other officials held a 
meeting with the chief of the Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic 
Policy Bureau, who returned home after attending a 
Japanese-U.S.-ROK meeting in Washington, to talk about 
countermeasures to deal with the situation. 
  The Joint Information Council was formed in 1983 to carry 
out 
coordination regarding issues that concern each ministry. The 
council has been studying countermeasures to deal with the North 
Korean issue since last fall. The list of possible "sanctions" 
that Japan submitted to the Japanese-U.S.-ROK meeting on 4 June 
was based on the outcome of meetings of this council. 
  The council meeting lasted more than an hour, and those 
attending discussed "things that they had never before talked 
about" (according to one of those in attendance). After the 
meeting, Ishihara and other attendees agreed that they would 
remain tight- lipped, saying: "We exchanged unofficial 
information.... We will not disclose it at all." 
  Fundamentally, the government's official stand is "to settle 
the issue through discussions" (according to Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai). A government source, in an attempt 
not to irritate the DPRK, stressed that "the meeting attended by 
the prime minister and other officials was not meant to be a big 
event like discussing countermeasures." 
  On the other hand, the government needs to explain its stand 
to the United States. The prime minister clarified last night 
the government's stand that Japan will act in concert with the 
United States in making a decision on sanctions. This remark 
reflects the complicated composition of the relations between 
Japan and other countries. A top government official said: 
"This is an issue related to Japanese-U.S., Japanese-ROK, 
Japanese-Chinese, and Japanese-Russian relations. A change in 
our relations with one country will have an impact on our 
relations with other countries." 
  The government has already compiled 10 nonmilitary measures 
to be prepared for a possible decision to impose economic 
sanctions on the DPRK. Of the 10 items, the Finance Ministry is 
worried the most about a ban on capital flows to North Korea. A 
senior International Financial Bureau official said: "This is 
completely different in terms of the extent of the sanctions 
imposed in the past. We hope that we can find a political 
settlement, if that is possible." 
  The United States pointed out that funds from Japan are a 
"major source of finances" for the Kim Il-song regime. 
Therefore, it is certain that the United States will demand 
that Japan strictly check the flow of funds from Japan to North 
Korea. However, the government, if it wants to be thorough in 
imposing regulations, will have to force North Koreans living in 
Japan and others who travel to the DPRK to undergo strict body 
and luggage checks at airports and seaports. Some officials are 
beginning to express their concerns, saying that "this may 
create confusion over the human rights issue and at airports and 
seaports." 
  As for a possible ban on the export of goods to North Korea, 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is 
saying that "We will carry out our duties once the government 
decides its policy" (according to a senior MITI official). It 
is possible to revise the Foreign Exchange Control Order and the 
Export Trade Control Order and to impose a ban within a few day 
after notifying the people of such a revision. The MITI has 
already taken action in this regard, and it has almost completed 
its in-house coordination. 
  On the other hand, the Defense Agency [DA] is assuming a 
situation will develop in which the United Nations will be 
forced to impose sanctions on the DPRK by taking military 
action, including a naval blockade. Among other things, the 
same agency is studying possible legal difficulties involving a 
situation in which the Self- Defense Forces are asked to join 
and cooperate in logistical support by supplying fuel and food 
to the military forces of the United States and other countries. 
However, DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama 
said: "That will be difficult because, generally speaking, the 
Self-Defense Forces are not allowed to carry out such tasks." 
  It is inevitable that Japan will be faced with the issue of 
constitutional interpretations, including exercising the right 
of collective self-defense, should the discussions be extended 
to such matters as directly participating in a naval blockade. 
Many DA officials take a cool view of this and say, "We cannot 
possibly hold such discussions" (according to a senior DA 
official).

Evening Edition] 
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Japan and Russia held their second 
trade and economic conference in Moscow on 2 June. In the 
meeting, the two governments agreed to make mutual efforts to 
settle at an early date the issue of Russia's delay in repaying 
debts in trade with Japan. Russia's trade debts have become a 
stumbling block to the promotion of trade between Japan and 
Russia. In the meeting, the Japanese delegates reaffirmed its 
proposal made by then Foreign Minister Hata in March that Japan 
will invite Russian leaders -- in the position of deputy prime 
minister or the equivalent -- to Japan. The two countries agreed 
to coordinate the scheduling of a visit by Russian leaders 
through diplomatic channels. 
  The meeting was attended by representatives from the 
ministries concerned of the two nations. The Japanese delegates 
were led by Deputy Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi 
while the Russian side was headed by First Deputy Minister 
Phratokov [as published] of the Foreign Economic Relations 
Ministry.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 09 June 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The Russians in the "Fourth Siberian Forestry 
Resources Development (KS) Project, a large-scale venture 
involving Japanese and Russian private companies, have proposed 
expanding the scale of the venture. 
  The venture's goal was originally to promote the forestry 
industry of the Russian Far East. However, the Russian proposal 
would add cooperation in the region's defense conversion and in 
the upgrading of its infrastructure. At the same time it would 
increase by 70 percent the supply of wood to Japan. The 
Japanese side is showing opposition to the proposal, citing such 
reasons as the venture's launch two years behind schedule. If 
there is no agreement by the end of July, the two sides will 
break off negotiations. 
  The possibility has thus arisen that the KS Project, 
anticipated as representing Japan-Russian economic exchange, 
will be put on hold. 
  The KS Project's initial framework entailed: (1) the 
Japanese side guaranteeing to purchase wood and processed 
products; and (2) the Russian side procuring with the foreign 
exchange thus earned capital goods for timber cutting, 
transporting, and processing. The project, begun in January 
1992, was expected to generate a total of 1.4 billion dollars 
over five years. There have been 17 main participants on the 
Japanese side, including companies like Marubeni, Nissho Iwai, 
and Mitsubishi Corporation. The Russian side comprises 
forestry-related companies. Both the Japanese and Russian 
Governments have lent their support to the project. 
  Due to economic disorder in Russia, however, such details as 
economic conditions and preferential tax measures were not 
resolved, thereby delaying the start of the venture. 
  The Russian side's present proposal is considered to go 
beyond the framework of the original idea of boosting the 
forestry industry and is now seen as a plan to promote the 
entire economy of the Russian Far East. 
  The Japanese side is reluctant to change the venture's 
framework. The concern is that increasing the supply of wood to 
Japan will tend to exacerbate market conditions.

  [Text] Leaders of Japan and the European Union (EU) will 
confirm their stand of "promoting dialogue on deregulation." 
This will be brought up for discussion as a major topic at a 
summit meeting among Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata; EU Commission 
President Jacques Delors; and Helmut Kohl, chancellor of Germany 
(the host country of the EU); when they attend the Naples Summit 
(the major industrialized nations' summit talks) in July. In 
response to the EU's proposal, Japan and the EU reached a basic 
agreement at a working-level meeting on 1 June. At the Japan-EU 
summit talks, the participants will confirm that "both sides 
will hold continuous dialogue, particularly on deregulation, 
which should be steadily implemented," and announce their policy 
to other countries. With regard to Japan's deregulation, the EU 
informed Japan this spring of its "concern" for 32 specific 
items, such as distribution and telecommunications. On the 
other hand, the EU has judged that "in light of the EU's 
experience in deregulation in the process of promoting market 
integration, Japan's deregulation requires mid- and long-term 
programs," (as stated by a high-ranking EU official). This is 
why it suggested strengthening channels of dialogue. The EU 
also aims to prevent Japan from giving special treatment to the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and to make Japan reaffirm 
the importance of Japan-EU economic relations. 
  Confirmation will be made at the summit talks "to lay the 
foundation for frutiful dialogue, and not merely meant to decide 
the framework of regular consultations for formality's sake," 
(according to a Japanese Government source). Therefore, in line 
with progress in Japan's deregulation, dialogue at various 
levels will be held.

  [Text] Brussels, 5 Jun -- During a recent interview with 
reporters from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and other press groups, 
European Commissioner Antonio Ruberti (in charge of science and 
technology) said that the European Union (EU) will urge Japan to 
hold regular Japan-EU ministerial consultations after the first 
such session to be held in Tokyo on 7 June, to strengthen 
cooperation between Japan and the EU in science and technology. 
He further said that he will suggest at the upcoming meeting 
that Japan should cooperate with the EU in reducing the emission 
of carbon dioxide and in space development. 
  During a ministerial meeting in January 1993, Japan and the 
EU agreed on strengthening cooperation in new areas, such as 
assistance to developing countries and science and technology, 
in addition to the existing industrial cooperation. In 
accordance with this agreement, the "Japan-EU Science and 
Technology Forum" will be held on 7 June. Ruberti and Mikio 
Omi, director general of the Science and Technology Agency, will 
attend this forum. 
  Ruberti proposed holding regular consultations of experts in 
addition to annual meetings of ministers concerned, saying: 
"Efforts should be made to hold forums on a regular basis." 
  He pointed out the need for strengthening cooperation in 
nuclear fusion and biotechnology programs, which is already 
taking place between Japan and EU, or is being conducted on a 
multinational basis among Japan, EU, the United States, and 
Russia. He then said that during his visit to Japan, he "would 
like to stress the need for cooperation in the area of the 
environment," such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions. 
  With regard to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, Ruberti 
showed an intention to discuss long-term tasks, as well as 
short- term concerns, such as technical development, electric 
power, and gas.

  [Text] On 4 June, the Canadian Government gave Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai a letter requesting 
deregulation in Japan's Building Standards Law [BSL] and the 
Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS). In a bid to urge Japan 
to increase imports of Canadian timber and other products, the 
letter has asked the Japanese Government to incorporate the 
request into a deregulation package, which will be compiled by 
the end of June. 
  Touching on the BSL, the letter claims: "Canadian-produced 
timber products are capable of satisfying fire prevention 
standards the same as those for nonwooden buildings." It 
requests the easing of building standards to enable the 
following: 1) construction of three-story wooden apartment 
houses in fire zones and semi-fire zones; and 2) construction of 
three-story wooden hotels using the 2- by-4 method. 
  The JAS bans the use of coniferous plywood for a concrete 
mold and strictly restricts the use of North American timber as 
structural wood such as pillars and beams. The letter has 
demanded the review of such restrictions. With regard to the 
Plant Protection Law, it has requested that negotiations on 
import agreements be shortened.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 3 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] According to a report submitted by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to the ruling parties' policy committee on 2 
June, the government is considering submitting to the 
International Court of Justice [ICJ] a position paper stating 
that "the use of nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of 
international law." Many policy committee members opposed this, 
because "even if this may not violate international law, it may 
not be proper for Japan to express such an opinion." The 
committee asked the Foreign Ministry to reconsider. 
  The WHO general meeting in May 1993 passed a resolution to 
seek a judicial opinion from the ICJ on the issue of "whether 
the use of nuclear arms, in view of its effects on health and 
the environment, constitutes a violation of international law." 
ICJ "agreed to take cognizance of the case," and has been 
asking various countries to give their opinions. The 
above-mentioned position paper is to be submitted to ICJ in 
response to this request, which has a deadline of 10 June. 
  According to a briefing given to the policy committee, the 
Foreign Ministry first questions the jurisdiction of ICJ as to 
whether it is appropriate for ICJ to make a judgment on this 
issue. However, it also asserts that "in Japan's opinion, the 
use of nuclear arms is not necessarily a violation of 
international law." 
  The position paper does not even require a cabinet decision. 
The Foreign Ministry says that with regard to this issue, "what 
we can say is that we are presently considering the problem, 
including whether we should submit a position paper."

  [Text] A "statement on the use of nuclear arms," which the 
government will soon submit to the International Court of 
Justice, is of the opinion that "the use of nuclear arms is not 
necessarily a violation of international law." Questions are 
being asked within the ruling coalition parties about the 
statement because Japan is the only victim of atomic bombs in 
the world and the statement is likely to trigger a controversy. 
  Last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) asked the 
International Court of Justice about whether "the use of nuclear 
weapons is illegal or not under the international law." In 
response, the International Court of Justice has requested each 
nation to submit its statement by 10 June this year. The 
statement in question has been compiled in response to the 
request from the International Court of Justice. The statement, 
which was compiled by the government on 4 June, notes, "The use 
of nuclear weapons does not conform to the humanitarian spirit 
manifested in the international law." The statement, however, 
says, "Speaking from the assessment of the international law, it 
cannot be said that a legal perception has been established in 
the international community that the use of nuclear weapons is 
illegal under the international law." The Foreign Ministry is 
stressing that "there is no change in this government's legal 
view of the statement," (according to Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Terasuke Terada). 
  When the Foreign Ministry briefed secretaries in charge of 
policy affairs of the ruling coalition parties at a 2 June 
meeting on the statement, one secretary after another refuted 
the statement, asking, "From Japan's position of seeking total 
abolishment of nuclear weapons, can it say the use of nuclear 
weapons is not illegal under the international law?" The 
secretaries asked the Foreign Minister to give additional 
briefing on the statement in writing.

  [Text] Mikio Omi, director general of the Science and 
Technology Agency [STA] announced on 3 June a plan to regularly 
disclose the amount of plutonium Japan has in stock. This is a 
part of the measures designed to show at home and abroad the 
transparency of Japan's plutonium utilization, in which other 
countries are interested. He explained this plan in response to 
a question asked by Osamu Imamura (of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]) at the House of Representatives Science 
and Technological Committee meeting on the same day. 
  In response to an inquiry by Tadatoshi Akiba, lower house 
Dietman (of the SDPJ), the STA disclosed last October the amount 
of plutonium in stock. However, the agency will make regular 
announcements in the future. Regarding the frequency of and how 
to make the announcements, the STA will study some possibilities 
while taking several factors into consideration, including 
progress at meetings on the framework of international plutonium 
utilization. 
  Director General Omi stressed: "To obtain understanding and 
cooperation from the people, it is important for us to disclose 
as much information as possible, except information on the 
protection of property rights, such as know-how regarding the 
protection of nuclear materials." 
  The amount of plutonium in stock as of late December last 
year, when the same agency made the announcement, was 1,600 
kilograms. Moreover, 2,900 kg of plutonium was stored in Britain 
and France, where plutonium is being reprocessed for Japan. The 
government announced previously that it would continue to 
maintain a balance between the supply of and demand for 
plutonium. Therefore, the government needs to disclose the 
amount of plutonium in stock to actually show that it is abiding 
by its own announcement.

  [Text] The outline of a report on the government's basic 
policy on atomic energy use in the 21st century has been 
revealed. The report is to be compiled on 27 May by a working 
panel on atomic energy under the Advisory Committee for Energy 
[ACE], an advisory body to the Agency of Natural Resources and 
Energy under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
In the report, the panel recommends that a study be made on 
developing a next- generation light water reactor which is safer 
than existing models and requires fewer operators and workers; 
the report suggests such a reactor would need to be ready for 
use by the year 2010. 
  As some nuclear reactors are expected to have reached the 
end 
of their useful life by the beginning of the 21st century, the 
panel also urges a prompt start to studies on developing 
technology to handle the disposal of nuclear waste that arises 
with the dismantling of reactors and on drawing up adequate 
safety standards. 
  On the issue of plutonium use, the panel's report is in line 
with the Long-Range Plan on the Development and Use of Atomic 
Energy, the outline of which was announced earlier by the Atomic 
Energy Commission. 
  Light water reactors account for about 90 percent of the 
world's nuclear reactors used for generating electricity. 
However, a great deal of trouble is involved in their 
maintenance and repair. 
  The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, manufacturers of 
nuclear reactors, and power companies plan to jointly compile a 
report on the results of their research over the next three 
years on next generation nuclear reactors. Such reactors, it is 
felt, must have "a high degree of safety, dependability, low 
impact on the environment, and low personnel costs." On the 
basis of such efforts, work will begin on making next generation 
nuclear reactor technology practical. 
  Japan is to start work on finalizing specific safety 
measures 
for its next generation nuclear reactor. However, the United 
States, which has already developed its next generation nuclear 
reactor, plans to reduce its scale and simplify it by making 
further improvements to a safety device that cools the reactor 
core in case of emergencies. 
  Meanwhile, nuclear reactors which began operating in the 
1970's will be getting too old by the 21st century. The ACE 
working panel, in its report, stresses that in dismantling old 
reactors "it will be necessary to gain the understanding of 
local residents for dismantling procedures, the disposal of 
waste materials, and land use after dismantling." 
  The panel, therefore, urges that detailed procedures and 
standards first be drawn up.

  [Text] The Space Development Committee [SDC] (whose 
chairman is Science and Technology Agency Director-General Omi) 
has revealed new satellite development projects for fiscal year 
1995 that include both a high-resolution land observation 
scientific satellite and a data relay satellite. With Prime 
Minister Hata offering a forward-leaning response to Diet 
interpellation on the issue of satellite information-gathering, 
a debate on reconnaissance satellites has arisen. At the same 
time the United States and Russia have begun actively to sell 
satellite information overseas in line with defense conversion 
in both countries. With Japan, too, upgrading its observation 
satellite technology, the line between the technology's military 
and peaceful uses is gradually disappearing. How far will the 
"information-gathering capability" of Japan's satellites go? 
  Among new projects under SDC consideration are the ALOS 
[expansion unknown] land observation satellite and the DRTS 
[expansion unknown] satellite for satellite-ground station data 
transmission. 
  ALOS, for which the National Aerospace Development Agency of 
Japan is planning a launch around 1999, will weigh approximately 
3.5 tons and orbit at approximately 700 kilometers. The 
satellite will be equipped with an optical sensor able to 
perceive visible and near-infrared light as well as a synthetic 
aperture radar [SAR] able to gauge the earth's topography by 
using reflected microwaves. The optical sensor will have a high 
resolution capable of distinguishing between objects 2.5 meters 
apart. 
  The satellite's SAR will have somewhat less resolution 
capability, but its microwaves will not be attenuated by clouds, 
enabling the satellite to conduct observations day or night 
under various atmospheric conditions. 
  The resolution of Japan's earth observation satellites has 
improved dramatically. The resolution of its first observation 
satellite, Momo, launched in February 1987, was 50 meters; for 
the earth resources satellite Fuyo, launched in February 1992, 
it was 18 meters. The resolution of the earth observation 
platform ADEOS [Advanced Earth Observing Satellite], a 
scientific satellite slated for launching in 1996, is eight 
meters. 
  The 2.5 m resolution projected for ALOS will far surpass the 
respective 30 m and 10 m resolutions of America's Landsat and 
France's SPOT [expansion unknown] satellites. Making the 
aperture of the light sensor's telescope and the focal distance 
for the ALOS satellite approximately twice that of the ADEOS 
will improve the former's resolution. 
  Using the ALOS, it will be easy to make maps with contours 
of 
1:25,000. The Science and Technology Agency explains its 
significance as "a tool for cooperation with Southeast Asia, 
which is having difficulties making maps." Detailed observation 
of how forests are being cut and what damage is taking place due 
to acid rain will also reportedly become possible. 
  At first ALOS was called HIROS [expansion unknown], the 
"HIR" 
standing for "high resolution." But the name was changed so as 
not to emphasize its high-resolution capability. Apparently at 
play, according to an individual involved, was the feeling that 
publicizing high-resolution capability "would give a pretext to 
the United States to try to sell us the U.S. high-resolution 
commercial satellites soon due to come on the market." 
  The goal for the data relay satellite, for its part, is the 
establishment of a 24-hour observation system. DRTS will 
therefore be launched prior to ALOS into a high 36,000 km 
geostationary orbit. The observation satellite will be unable to 
send data directly to Japanese ground stations when on the other 
side of the earth, but will be able to send a large volume of 
information on a real-time basis via the relay satellite.

  [Text] At a news conference on 30 May, Defense Agency [DA] 
Administrative Vice-Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama revealed that 
the agency will consider developing and owning reconnaissance 
satellites to strengthen Japan's information-gathering 
capability in the field of defense. 
  Administrative Vice-Minister Hatekayama stated: "For Japan, 
which strictly adheres to defense only, it is important to 
improve our information-gathering capability. I do not know 
whether that means reconnaissance satellites or not. But we are 
interested in strengthening and expanding our 
information-gathering capability and must study various 
possibilities." 
  Regarding utilization and development of reconnaissance 
satellites, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata showed a positive stance 
at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 26 May, 
saying that "the most important thing to the national security 
is to possess accurate information." 
  The DA is examining the possibility of acquiring on a 
commercial basis from American companies photographs from 
high-performance satellites developed for military 
reconnaissance use. For the future, the DA is also studying the 
possibility of owning reconnaissance satellites or 
meteorological satellites equipped with reconnaissance 
capability for joint military and civilian use. 
  Moreover, positive opinions, which support the idea of 
owning 
reconnaissance satellites from a viewpoint of boosting 
information- gathering capability, were expressed at a meeting 
of the "Panel for Studying Defense Issues," a private advisory 
organ to Prime Minister Hata. The panel is chaired by Hirotaro 
Higuchi, chairman of Asahi Breweries, Ltd. 
  However, it seems that the idea of owning reconnaissance 
satellites will trigger a debate. There exists a Diet 
resolution for limiting the use of space to peaceful ends. 
Reconnaissance satellites are also expected to require a great 
deal of money.

  [Text] The Economic Planning Agency's (EPA) research group 
for strategic trade and industrial policy has put together an 
analysis of government-led research projects. The analysis 
indicates that the projects tend to be rigid with regard to 
advances in technology and that the results cannot meet current 
technology needs. 
  The agency is harshly critical of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] on the issue of 
government-funded joint projects involving a number of 
corporations. The research group's analysis is that there is 
insufficient exchange of technical information among the 
participating corporations, a considerable departure from the 
essence of joint research. 
  EPA's research group has taken as examples three 
representative joint development projects in the field of 
information/electronics that MITI ran from the 1970's to the 
1990's, analyzing their significance and problems. 
  The agency's research group had high praise for MITI's Very 
Large-Scale Integrated Circuit [VLSI] Project (fiscal years 
1976- 79) aimed at developing high-performance semiconductors, 
in which Japan's major electronics manufacturers participated. 
EPA's group praised the project for raising Japan's 
semiconductor manufacturing technology to the highest level in 
the world, laying the foundation for the development of the 
nation's semiconductor industry. 
  However, the Supercomputer Project (fiscal years 1981-89) 
and 
the Fifth Generation Computer Project (fiscal years 1982-92), 
two projects begun in the early 1980s, were found by the EPA 
research group to have set development goals which were less 
clear than those for the VLSI Project. In particular, the Fifth 
Generation Computer Project's goal of developing artificial 
intelligence despite declining interest in the technology was 
judged to have left the project behind developments. 
  EPA's research group indicated that, although a number of 
corporations participated in the joint development projects, 
participation amounted to nothing more than each corporation 
being given separate development subjects. The problem was that 
there had been no joint development in the true sense of the 
term. EPA's group is calling for more emphasis on the merits of 
such practices as sharing technical information.

  [Text] In a speech to a Democratic Socialist Party 
convention on the morning of 7 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said: "We have to form a political group capable of competing 
against the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and taking the reins 
of government in a dignified manner." In this way, he again 
indicated that he would make the Hata administration a 
full-fledged government and carry out political reorganization 
while considering forming a new political party. 
  After attending the convention, Hata returned to the prime 
minister's official residence. There, he was asked by reporters 
about his speech at the convention. Hata said: "The hasty 
formation of (new parliamentary group) `Kaishin' created 
confusion. So, we have to proceed slowly next time. In the 
initial stage, the political group I mentioned should function 
as a parliamentary group. But in the future, I think it should 
become a political party." His remark suggests that he will 
first form a new parliamentary group that includes the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan.

  [Text] On 7 June, the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] set a policy of putting together a party governing 
concept in order to form a new coalition government after the 
Diet passes the fiscal year 1994 budget. The party's goal is to 
press Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata either to have his cabinet 
resign en masse or to choose the path of rejecting the concept, 
dissolving the Diet, and calling a general election. The 
pillars of the SDPJ's governing concept include: (1) Respecting 
the ideals of the constitution; and (2) taking responsibility 
for and a role in global peace and disarmament. Based on the 
items agreed upon by each party in the Hosokawa coalition 
government at the time of its establishment in August 1993, the 
SDPJ will put "protecting the constitution" in the forefront. 
The SDPJ's governing concept will also specifically call for 
reforming the decisionmaking system for the government and 
ruling parties to make it a democratic and open one. The SDPJ 
will decide on beginning party procedures in its Central 
Executive Committee as early as 9 June. In addition, Committee 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is planning to call on Prime Minister 
Hata to hold a party summit where he will present the SDPJ's 
ideas in detail. 
  The new governing concept is based on the thinking that, 
according to a senior party executive: "The SDPJ was pressed at 
the April policy conference of the coalition government parties 
to ratify the policy accord put together by the other parties. 
We were thus unable to put forth our own positions." The 
party's aim in formulating the new concept is to play the lead 
role in the government conference by putting forth its own ideas 
first. 
  In particular, in taking seriously the debate following the 
argument of Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and others for 
changing the constitutional interpretation on the right to 
collective self- defense, there is gaining ground in the SDPJ 
the view that there must be a clear reflection on World War II. 
Concerning the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North 
Korea) nuclear development issue, there is a wish to go beyond 
the April policy conference to a concrete response in 
strengthening further the position of "resolving the issue 
through talks within the framework of the constitution." 
  Concerning government and ruling party decisionmaking, too, 
the SDPJ's governing concept will press for a reform of the 
council of party representatives led by Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other party executives 
as well a shift to "ruling party summits" and other "forums for 
open discussion" previously proposed by SDPJ Central Executive 
Committee Chairman Murayama.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "SDPJ's Outrageous Political Maneuvering"] </F>
  [Text] It is over a month since the Hata cabinet was 
formed and the administration continues to drift on uncertain 
waters, betraying weaknesses as a minority government such as 
the resignation of a justice minister for his ignominious 
remark, and contradictory statements by various ministers at 
Diet sessions. 
  Even more dismal is the spectacle of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] since it seceded from the coalition to 
join the ranks of the opposition. 
  Immediately after the present cabinet was inaugurated, SDPJ 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama attempted to take political 
leadership by advocating "negotiated dissolution" of the House 
of Representatives. He proposed: "The next general election 
should be held under the current multiseat district system on 
condition that the following general elections are held under 
the new system of single-seat districts and proportional 
representation." 
  However, "Murayama's initiative" that advocated an early 
dissolution of the Diet under the current multiseat constituency 
system met with fierce opposition from the "Democrats," a policy 
group of SDPJ rightists who advocate political reform. 
  The reasons for opposition are twofold: (1) political reform 
bills which were passed by the Diet will be complete only when 
bills on redrawing electoral districts for the Lower House, 
which are being drawn up at present, are passed by the Diet; (2) 
if a general election is held under the current multiseat 
constituency system before political reform bills are passed by 
the Diet, the single- seat constituency system, whose 
introduction was decided by the will of the Diet, will become 
merely nominal. This would be tantamount to "torpedoing 
political reform" in the final analysis. 
  As a replacement for "Murayama's initiative" which lost its 
persuasiveness, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo advocated 
"voluntary general resignation." Kubo said: "The Hata cabinet 
should resign en masse after the budget for the current fiscal 
year is passed, and should begin talks with the SDPJ toward 
forming a third coalition government within a new framework." 
  Although "a new framework" is set as a condition, in the 
final analysis this is a clear indication of the SDPJ's 
intention to "return to the coalition government." 
  To cope with the political situation after the passage of 
the 
budget, the SDPJ chairman and the general secretary presented 
two strategies which are diametrically opposed to each other. 
In addition, "Kubo's initiative" encountered criticism from 
inside and outside the party. 
  At the central committee meeting of the SDPJ which began on 
28 May, an immediate action plan was proposed in which two 
contradictory strategies -- "Murayama's initiative" and "Kubo's 
initiative" were written side by side. Kubo's initiative was 
criticized for "pandering to power in an unprincipled manner." 
  Depending upon the interpretation of the strategies, they 
may 
be taken as a two-pronged plan amid an unclear political 
situation, but both contain fatal contradictions. 
  In establishing the post-Hata administration in the ruling 
coalition parties, the SDPJ confirmed a "new policy agreement" 
after lengthy policy discussion. However, when it found out 
about the group called "Kaishin" that excluded the SDPJ, it 
broke away from the coalition government, claiming it was a 
"breach of faith." 
  Although the blame may be laid on the side that formed 
"Kaishin" without notifying the SDPJ, the SDPJ made the Hata 
administration a minority government by resorting to the most 
forceful action -- breaking away from the coalition government. 
The SDPJ will never obtain a satisfactory understanding from 
the public if it tries to "return to power" in such a short time 
no matter how it emphasizes "a new framework and discussion for 
political power." 
  Moreover, apart from an emergency such as the prime minister 
falling seriously ill, if the current cabinet resigns en masse 
merely because of talks with the SDPJ, and without the passage 
of a non-confidence vote or a situation where the passage of a 
non- confidence vote is inevitable, and undertakes to establish 
a coalition government, that will be not so much illicit union 
as "collusive politics" which seek one's own interests without 
regard for the public. 
  What the SDPJ needs at present is not to be swayed by the 
prospect of immediate advantage but to conduct an all-out debate 
within the party on how to develop its own perspective of the 
future political situation.

"Good Opportunity To Demolish MOF's Superior Position; Diet To 
Raise Question"] 
  [Text] 1. Political instability increases dependency on the 
bureaucracy for policy formation. Political initiative is 
indispensable to reform bureaucratic control. 
  2. The prominent power of the MOF [Ministry of Finance] 
bureaucrats regarding recent policy formation stands out. Today, 
however, when the people's awareness concerning burdens and 
benefits has matured, it can also be said that an opportunity 
has come to demolish the past superiority of the MOF bureaucrats. 
  3. The relationships of regulation, cooperation, and 
separation are necessary between policy and administration, and 
system reform for these purposes is expected from the new 
government. 
<H5>  "Personifiers of National Interest" a Myth </H5>
  The Hosokawa administration ended in an unexpected demise, 
and the political world rushed feverishly into the second act of 
its reorganization. Politicians tend to relish rebellions, and 
they cannot help bouncing around like fish taking to water 
during such an upheaval. However, it is highly questionable 
whether the alignment changes among the political parties and 
the politicians will actually lead to a change in Japan's 
politics. The reason is that the point of how to escape from 
bureaucratic control and to realize politics led by the 
political parties is missing from today's axial issue of 
reorganization of the parties. 
  In Japan's politics, the ruling party represents, instead of 
an entity that embodies a doctrine, nothing more than a position 
of monopoly access to the budget or authority in the hands of 
the bureaucracy. The more the political parties compete with 
each other and the longer the political vacuum is prolonged, the 
greater the government's actual dependency on the bureaucracy 
becomes. If the current drama of political party reorganization 
fails to recharge political energy for the purpose of taking 
command of the bureaucracy and ends as a tempest in a teacup 
called Nagata-cho, the road to political reform must be deemed 
to be far. 
  Following the change of administrations, there is a strong 
impression of the MOF's mounting impact on policy formation. The 
greatest barrier in an attempt to convert from bureaucratic 
control to political party politics is probably how to change 
this point. 
  During the past dozen or more years as the emergence of the 
"zoku" Diet members became conspicuous, instead of examining the 
need for individual annual spending programs, the MOF 
bureaucrats have manipulated such symbols as the "cumulative 
rise of national debts" or the "welfare revenue sources in an 
aging society," and have devoted their efforts toward the 
suppression of social expectation levels vis-a-vis policy 
benefits. 
  A strategy existed of coexisting with interests politics on 
the one hand, and forcing declining benefits and rising burdens 
onto the general population on the other. With the change in 
administrations, not only did the pressures of interests 
politics weaken, but also as public opinion polls at the time of 
the uproar over the people's welfare tax indicated, the majority 
of the people have begun to think that an increase in the tax 
burden is unavoidable if it is for the sake of stable social 
security. It may perhaps be said to be a time for the 
bureaucrats to rejoice. 
  However, such an environmental change has the potential to 
destroy the MOF bureaucrats' own position of superiority. First 
is the limitation to the debate on sound finance. The soundness 
of finance is not a value per se, but a prerequisite condition 
for coping with an important policy task. 
  As long as the people display a determination to pay taxes, 
they have a legitimate right to demand an expansion of necessary 
policy measures and a reduction of unnecessary measures. In the 
first place, the authority of the MOF bureaucrats was permitted 
to rule in a political atmosphere of lesser burdens and greater 
benefits. 
  Second, there is the timid posture of the MOF bureaucrats 
regarding a reexamination of the existing annual spending 
structure. In addition to securing tax revenues, the 
rationalization of annual expenditures is indispensable for 
sound finance. However, the MOF bureaucrats have avoided any 
restructuring of annual spending that takes time and effort 
politically. Moreover, they have committed the contradiction of 
investing profits from the sales of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation] stocks, which should have been applied 
toward national bond redemption, instead toward such 
insignificant public service projects as resort development. The 
myth that "MOF bureaucrats personify the national interest" 
could probably be demolished by questioning such contradictions 
from the side of politics. 
  Thus bureaucratic control that seemed to be strengthened at 
first glance is not rock-firm at all. A break from bureaucratic 
control becomes possible by the people and the politicians 
shouldering the real costs of sustaining a welfare state on the 
one hand, and making clear their intentions concerning policy 
objectives on the other. Also, the bureaucrats should thus 
prepare a scenario that includes a plurality of policy measures, 
and the people should choose from them. Such is the inherent 
arrangement of democratic politics in action. 
<H5>  Point Out Problems Which Are Invisible From Within </H5>
  Amid the present vortex of political party reorganization, 
terms like "normal nation" and "social democratic liberal" are 
being bandied about. However, without any viewpoint on the kind 
of apparatus that will be formed to implement policy decisions, 
such polemics remain mere symbols without content. Major policy 
tasks change at intervals of 20 to 30 years, and a 
reorganization of the political structure itself is demanded in 
order to accurately respond to such changes. 
  In fact, examples in Europe and the United States show that 
integration and abolition (reorganization) of central government 
agencies is not so rare, and it is common for a new 
administration to firmly implement the scrap-and-build process 
of the agencies. 
  In this sense the strong continuity of Japan's central 
government agencies may be regarded as exceptional. It is also a 
reflection of the long-term continuity of one-party rule on the 
side of politics, and the lack of concern among the political 
leaders regarding a structuring of the administrative apparatus. 
Speaking of creating new politics, it should be the 
responsibility of the politicians to indicate a medium-term 
vision, first of all, on what problems they will grapple with 
and with what kind of administrative organization. 
  A debate on the posture of the bureaucrats often ends in a 
simple attack on the bureaucrats due to anger against 
bureaucratism. However, both the administrative organization and 
policy were initially formed because of social demand, and it is 
a delicate question as to whether it is pathological or 
physiological for the bureaucrats to work diligently at their 
stations and to defend their organizations and budgets. As our 
experience as individuals proves, it is difficult for us to 
objectively evaluate our own work. 
  When policy implemented by bureaucrats with a subjectively 
noble sense of purpose loses its significance amid the eral and 
environmental changes, and when no one within the existing 
division-of-labor system notices the important problems that 
have newly arisen, it is not the responsibility of the 
bureaucrats themselves but the responsibility of politics to 
point out such problems. It is a great misfortune for Japan's 
bureaucrats that all others are virtually nonexistent. 
Consequently, reform of bureaucratic control is inseparably 
linked to improvement of competence on the side of politics. 
<H5>  Bona Fide Administration With Command Power Necessary </H5>
  The proper relations between politics and administration are 
divided into the three categories of regulation, cooperation and 
separation. Regulation exists when the political leaders are in 
command over the bureaucracy and they check the efficiency and 
integrity of administration on behalf of the people. Cooperation 
exists when the response by the politicians to the people's will 
and the specialized competence of the buraucrats blend together 
smoothly. Separation means the rule that the authority and 
financial resources held by the administrative organs are not 
used to cultivate the power of specific parties or factions. 
  In Japan, the long postwar rule by the LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party] overlapped with the history of the 
bureaucrats' position of superiority, and the relationship 
between politics and administration became complicated. 
  For example, as the "zoku" Dietmen phenomenon indicates, 
relations between the ruling party and the bureaucracy became 
intimate and, as a result, the abuses of the bureaucracy such as 
sectionalism and conservatism moved parallel to the ruling party 
side. In addition, the cabinet and the ruling party lost their 
power of leadership and coordination. Also, subsidies and the 
licensing authority were used to broaden support for the ruling 
party, resulting in a series of corruption scandals. 
  Consequently, a restructuring of the relations between 
politics and administration based on the three criteria is 
urgently necessary. In order to give concrete form to 
regulation, it is first necessary to strengthen the cabinet as a 
reservoir of political energy. In Japan, there are numerous 
cases where the big boss of the ruling party such as 
Representative Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
devotes himself to party affairs without necessarily becoming a 
member of the cabinet himself. However, this is a problem from 
the standpoint of the purpose of the parliamentary cabinet 
system. First of all, the leading politicians must be convened 
within the cabinet and a system must be established to lead the 
bureaucracy. 
  In Japan's previous cabinets, the ministerial posts were 
offered to the ruling party's politicians as concessions, and it 
was natural for the cabinet members to be taken lightly by the 
bureaucrats. It is also important to provide information equally 
to the Diet members of both the opposition and the ruling party, 
and thus facilitate checks by the Diet. 
  In order to promote smooth cooperation between politics and 
administration, it is important to reexamine the practices of 
the Diet and the government offices which have wasted the 
inherent capabilities of the bureaucrats. 
  For example, when the Diet is in session, a great many 
bureaucrats are kept extremely busy drafting interpellations to 
the Diet members and replies by the cabinet members. If the Diet 
deliberations are enhanced by debates of quality content between 
the politicians, the bureaucrats should be able to devote 
themselves to their inherent duties of policy planning. 
  The abuse of personnel authority seen in the reshuffle of 
bureau directors at MITI [Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry] goes against cooperation. 
  In order to maintain separation between politics and 
administration, it is necessary to strictly observe the recently 
enacted administrative procedures act and to coordinate 
interests in administration with fairness. Also, enacting a 
freedom-of-information act and enhancing transparency in policy 
planning and its implementation process will serve to prevent 
corruption. 
  It is also urgently necessary to promote business orders 
based on fair competition through an improved bidding system. 
Regarding these points, the self-proclaimed pro-reform group of 
politicians should aggressively submit problems from the Diet 
side and take the initiative for concrete system reform. 
  In any case, in order to reexamine the relations between 
politics and administration, a reform of awareness is 
indispensable for the politicians who have considered it their 
supreme proposition to gain access to administrative budgets and 
authority. It is hoped that, instead of being engrossed in a 
power game without any ideology, they will grapple with reform 
with an awareness as members of the same legislative branch of 
government.
