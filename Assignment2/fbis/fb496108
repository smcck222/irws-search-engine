<F P=106> [Interview with Chinese President Jiang Zemin by NHK Chief </F>
Commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima in Beijing's Zhongnanhai on 10 
June; from the "World Station 22" program -- recorded; Jiang's 
remarks in Chinese fading into Japanese translation] 
  [Excerpts] [Takashima] I have many things to ask you. 
First, I would like to ask you about an issue that draws 
international attention. The international community has 
continued discussion on North Korea's (DPRK's) suspected nuclear 
arms development, with China playing a leading role. I would 
like to ask how China intends to resolve the issue. 
  [Jiang Zemin] We follow current events with great interest. 
Patient efforts are necessary to solve complicated issues such 
as the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The more 
difficult the issue, the more we need to keep calm. We are 
calling on all parties concerned to exercise restraint. In 
solving the issue, the ultimate objectives are to secure 
stability and peace on the peninsula and to achieve 
denuclearization there. As long as we do not deviate from these 
two basic objectives, it is possible to find a way of resolving 
the issue properly, whatever temporary difficulties may arise. 
  What we should see is that the door to negotiations has not 
been completely closed and that there is still room for 
dialogue. All nations concerned need to take active measures to 
prevent the crisis from intensifying, and they should not let 
their efforts over the past year be wasted. China does not 
approve of sanctions. Sanctions will not help us resolve the 
issue. On the contrary, they will escalate the situation and 
bring about a result which no one wants to see. The only way 
for resolving the issue is to continue dialogue. 
  [Takashima] I would like to ask an additional question. Mr. 
President, you said the door to negotiations has not yet been 
closed. In concrete terms, what kind of talks do you think will 
be held in the future? 
  [Jiang] We have consistently hoped that talks among the four 
concerned parties, including North Korea, will be held. 
  [Takashima] The Japanese people have come to share a 
stronger belief that relations with China have become more 
important in view of various issues, including North Korea's 
nuclear issue. Mr. President, what is your view on the current 
situation of relations between Japan and China and on future 
relations? 
  [Jiang] We saw several great changes in Japan's political 
scene. However, the friendly cooperation between China and 
Japan in various fields is steadily developing. The Japanese 
ruling and opposition parties, as well as many Japanese people, 
share the view that friendly cooperation between Japan and China 
should be developed. Sino-Japanese friendship is full of great 
vitality based on common interests, long historical and cultural 
origins, and a solid foundation of the masses. As a politician, 
I would like to fall in line with the historical trend of the 
times and do some solid deeds to help build bilateral relations. 
The 20th century is coming to an end soon. Between China and 
Japan, there is a civilian organization called the 21st Century 
Committee for China-Japan Friendship. This indicates that both 
the Chinese and Japanese peoples wish to look forward to the 
21st century by building Sino- Japanese relations based on 
mutual understanding, mutual trust, equality, cooperation, and 
common prosperity. I am fully confident about the future of 
Sino-Japanese relations. 
  [Takashima] Next I would like to ask you about Sino-U.S. 
relations, which must be very important in regards to China's 
foreign affairs. While the United States has extended China's 
most favored nation [MFN] status, it is also a fact that there 
is some opposition to it in the United States. Mr. President, 
how do you feel about the current state of bilateral relations 
with the United States, and how do you feel about future 
relations? 
  [Jiang Zemin] President Clinton recently announced his 
decision to extend China's MFN status and pledged not to link 
the human rights issue to the MFN status in the future. This 
decision will help strengthen and expand cooperative ties in 
economics and trade between China and the United States. It 
will also conform to the basic interests of the two countries 
and their peoples. As long as both sides look toward the 
future, the global situation as a whole, and their basic 
interests; adhere to the principles set in the three Sino-U.S. 
joint communiques, enhance trust, develop cooperation, and avoid 
confrontation, Sino-U.S. relations will develop smoothly. 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted on NHK commentators restating 
what is about to be discussed in the actual interview] 
[Takashima] Fifteen years have passed since the social market 
economy and the reform and open-door policies were introduced. 
The Chinese economy is now making remarkable progress. How do 
you assess this situation? 
  [Jiang] Major changes have been made during the past decade 
since we launched the reform and open-door policies. We have 
formed a versatile economic framework centered around public 
ownership systems, including the state ownership system. The 
market has already started to play the fundamental role of 
distributing [word indistinct]. The areas directly controlled 
by the government are already shrinking. The 14th Communist 
Party of China [CPC] National Congress in 1992 confirmed the 
socialist market economy's goals. We adopted a resolution 
regarding the establishment of the socialist market economy at 
the 3d Plenary Session of the [13th] CPC Central Committee, 
which was held in November last year. We are preponderantly 
solving problems on the basis of these decisions. 
  The socialist market economy is linked to socialism's 
fundamental systems. There is no precedence for making such a 
system. It is creative work and, needless to say, we face 
various problems. For example, we have to find solutions to how 
we will maintain a balance between reform, development, and 
stability; regulate the roles of macro control and market; bring 
about the enterprising spirit in the urban and local areas; link 
material culture with spiritual culture; realize overall social 
progress centered around economic construction; and etc. 
  We already have some experiences in the field of recognizing 
and treating these problems. Our tasks, or the framework of the 
CPC's tasks, are moving toward a new direction on the basis of 
the policies designed to find a chance, promote reform, expand 
the open- door policies, promote progress, and maintain 
stability. We can fulfill this historic responsibility through 
the party's unified guidance and joint efforts by the people of 
each nationality across the nation under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
ideology of socialism, which is peculiar to China, and the CPC's 
fundamental line. We will establish the social market economic 
system by the end of the 21st century and will complete the 
building of an affluent and democratic socialist nation by 
around the middle of the 21st century. 
  [Excerpts] [Takashima] In the remarks you have just made, 
Mr. President, you mentioned that problems of various types have 
surfaced in the Chinese economy. There are such problems as 
disparity between urban and rural areas and corruption, which 
has been reported in several localities. You said that positive 
measures will be taken to deal with these problems. I would 
like to hear what practical plans you have in mind to resolve 
these domestic problems that China is now facing. 
  [Jiang] All those problems that I have just mentioned are 
connected with each other. First, further efforts should be 
made to build a clean government and to get rid of corruption. 
These are the conditions required for establishing the 
socialist market economic system, and at the same time, they 
will affect the success or failure of our reform policy. Our 
party and government maintain a very clear-cut position on this 
issue. The economy will be developed and the government will 
become a clean one. 
  Generally speaking, the large majority of our cadres are 
good. Only a small number are corrupt, and severe disciplinary 
actions will be taken against them in accordance with party 
discipline and state laws. Various measures have already been 
taken and some results have been gradually achieved through 
educational, administrative, juridical, and other measures. 
Efforts will be made to get rid of corruption and our 
determination is supported by the general public. 
  With the economy's development, disparity has come to exist 
and expand between urban and rural areas as well as among 
various localities. There are various reasons for such a 
phenomenon. The basic objective of socialism lies in 
eliminating poverty and sharing prosperity. And therein also 
lies the objective of efforts to promote reform and development. 
It is also an important factor for maintaining stability of our 
society and unity of our nation. 
  In the course of attaining this objective, there naturally 
exists differences in the speed of achievement among various 
localities, with some developing faster than others. We 
encourage those localities with favorable conditions to promote 
development at a faster speed. At the same time, we encourage 
other localities that are developing at a slower pace to speed 
up their development by making good use of their strong points. 
We encourage those localities developing at a faster speed to 
assist other localities developing at a slower pace with funds, 
technology, and talented people. The government will also 
provide sufficient assistance to those localities developing at 
a slower pace in such areas as policy, finance, and materials. 
  At present, we are engaged in promoting a mid-term 7-year 
program to eliminate poverty. We intend to resolve problems in 
seven years for 80 million people who have not solved such basic 
necessities as food and clothing. We are convinced that through 
such measures, the disparity between urban and rural areas and 
among various localities, will be gradually reduced. 
  Such disparity between urban and rural areas and among 
various localities also exist in various countries of the world. 
We are willing to learn from other countries' useful 
experiences in resolving this problem. At the same time, we 
will basically and eventually resolve this problem with the 
strength of socialism and our own practice and experiences. The 
superiority of the socialist system lies in the idea of all 
people sharing prosperity and making progress. 
  When viewed from a long-term standpoint, the disparity 
existing between urban and rural areas and among various 
localities will gradually be reduced, but will never expand. 
Otherwise, stability in our society and country cannot be 
maintained. We have a very clear understanding of these 
problems. Measures to deal with these issues are being 
perfected day by day. 
  [Excerpts] [Takashima] Mr. President, it has been widely 
reported that you visited Shanxi Province last January and 
firmly stated your resolve to stamp out absolute poverty, as you 
have just mentioned, within this century, and that you also said 
the development of rural districts and their stability hold the 
key to China's development and stability. Do you think there is 
sufficient time to solve the problem by the end of the century? 
It has been said that there are concerns in some quarters that 
the gap between cities and rural districts may cause social 
unrest in China. How do you feel about this? 
  [Jiang] Regarding this problem, we have already explained 
our 
policy. That is, while acknowledging the disparity that 
actually exists among regions, our job is directed toward 
reducing such gaps. These problems can be solved through our 
efforts and through appropriate measures and policies. 
  [Takashima] One last question. Mr. President, you are also 
the commander in chief of the Chinese military. Let me ask you 
about the future of the People's Liberation Army [PLA]. What do 
you have in mind regarding plans to reform the PLA? Also, 
looking at China from the outside, it has been pointed out that 
China has been building up its military. For example, it has 
been noted that China increased its defense spending by 22 
percent this year. Please let us hear about your views 
regarding the PLA's future. 
  [Jiang] To protect our sovereignty and our territories, 
preserve the nation's unity, ensure our people's safety, and 
ensure socialism can be modernized and constructed in a safe and 
stable environment, the PLA is burdened with heavy 
responsibilities. The basic policy regarding military buildup 
at a certain period in the future is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
idea on military buildup in a new age -- that is, China's unique 
way of modernizing its military and improving its quality, in 
particular, improving hi-tech defense capabilities. We will 
gradually change the PLA into a modern regular revolutionary 
army. The Chinese Government's investment in military 
construction is very limited. This year's defense budget is 52 
billion yuan, which is around 1.7 percent of the gross national 
product. It is about 6 billion U.S. dollars and less than 
one-fifth of Japan's [defense budget]. The amount of Japan's 
[defense budget] exceeds $30 billion. Military expenses per 
person is even less. The small increase in the military budget 
is purely for defense purposes and will not pose a threat to 
other countries. All knowledgeable people in the world admit 
that stability in China will serve for stability in Asia and the 
world. The Chinese people, who went through difficulties during 
wartime, truly want peace and stability while promoting 
socialism's modernization. China will not take part in an arms 
race, form military alliances, nor engage in power disputes.

<F P=106> [Article by Tadashi Ikeda, former director general of the </F>
Asian Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs] 
  [Text] We need to avoid discussing Asia ignoring the 
diversity of the region and contrasting it with what is 
non-Asia. How should Japanese foreign policy develop in the Asia 
Pacific regions, which includes Asian countries, North America, 
and Australia? 
<H5>  Diversity of Asia </H5>
  Recently there have been attempts to reconsider Asia as one 
unified area sharing common "traditions" and "values." Strange 
terms, such as "identity" of Asia, are often being used. As the 
background to this trend, we can point out the recent remarkable 
economic development in some nations in eastern Asia, and the 
confidence these nations have begun to possess in their ability 
to build a nation. 
  This attempt to positively understand Asia's characteristics 
should be welcomed, and we should not get upset about it. If 
indeed a common culture and value can be found throughout Asia 
and this helps Asia to be unified, there is no argument against 
it. 
  The people who attempt to do this, for example, list as the 
characteristics of Asian nations--it seems that they are talking 
about Eastern Asia--people's diligence and labor ethics, which 
are based on the cultures influenced by Confucianism, decorum 
and norms, such as benevolence and justice, frugal spirit, high 
rate of savings, and inclination to accept Japanese-style 
management. They say that some of these common cultures and 
values contribute to the fact that Asia's economy has the 
highest growth rate in the world. 
  These arguments make me think that they are in too much of a 
hurry to come to a conclusion and are trying to find Asia as one 
united region. I feel that there are two pitfalls which they may 
fall into in this approach. One is that they may completely 
ignore the Asian region's diversity, and escape to the ideal 
land of the simplified "Asia is one." The other pitfall is that 
by viewing Asia from the standpoint of "Asia versus non-Asia," 
the relationship between Asia and the other regions tends to be 
viewed as a competition. 
  Thailand, where I had worked until a year and a half ago, is 
located on the Indochina peninsula. Their culture, including 
their religion (Jozabu Buddhism) and dancing, came from India. 
However, the Chinese who immigrated later planted their roots in 
Thai society, and they interbred with the Thai. Today, the word 
"kakyo (overseas Chinese)" has lost its original meaning. In 
today's Thailand, because things that were originally from India 
or China have been completely absorbed into Thai society, it is 
almost meaningless to search for things Indian or things 
Chinese. Though influenced by both India and China, as the word 
"Indochina" suggests, this country has succeeded in creating its 
own culture and value system which cannot be called anything 
other than Thai through their unique language. Therefore, 
reasoning such as "the Thai people's work ethic has been 
influenced by the Chinese who brought Confucianism, which values 
diligence," does not explain Thailand's high economic growth of 
today. Instead, in order to explain the recent economic 
prosperity of Thailand, we need to look for the causes of 
success in the areas of the stable political situation, 
high-quality bureaucracy, consistent policy of installing 
foreign capital, and quality labor. 
  In Vietnam, which is also located on the Indochina 
peninsula, 
the leaders are getting ready to devote themselves to 
"nation-building" after the end of the Cambodian conflict. 
Vietnam had been completely left behind by the ASEAN countries, 
such as Thailand, in economic development. While being strongly 
influenced by the Chinese culture historically, Vietnam has 
repeatedly experienced militaristic conflicts with China. This 
nation has had a love-hate relationship with China. In Vietnam, 
which embraces Mahayanist Buddhism and belongs to the "cultural 
area of chopsticks," it is possible to find the influence of 
Confucianism in their diligence and their work ethics. At any 
rate, the prospect is bright concerning their nation-building. 
  Very few people predicted the position of today's Myanmar 
[Burma] located to the west of Thailand. Burma is settling for 
being a "developing country." For the people in this country, 
who are pious Buddhists, political stability, liberation, and 
democratization seem to be the first problems to be dealt with, 
before discussing economic development. 
  The reason why I have taken these three countries in 
Indochina as examples was merely to describe the diversity of 
Asia. The diversity will be even more evident if I mention the 
cultures, religions, and societies of Cambodia and Laos. While 
being located on or close to the Indochina peninsula, the 
religions, traditions, and cultures differ greatly. And in some 
countries, colonization by foreign countries has further 
increased the difference. 
  There exists a big cultural and religious gap even among the 
nations in Indochina, which seem to be homogeneous. It is not 
easy to discuss traditional cultures and values as something 
shared in common throughout Asia. Before we discuss Asia's 
common identity, we, including myself, need to ask ourselves how 
much we understand the real situations of other Asian countries. 
  Also, by stressing too much Asia's common characteristics 
and 
values, there is a tendency to view Asia's relationship with the 
rest of the world in terms of "Asia versus non-Asia"--you may 
call this Asianism. We need to be careful about this. It would 
be too short-sighted to think that Japan should value its 
relationship with Asian countries rather than its relationship 
with the United States or Europe, faced with the movement in the 
United States and Europe to integrate regional economies 
(formation of EC, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], 
etc.) 
<H5>  Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region </H5>
  I do recognize the importance of Asia in our country's 
foreign policy. And I do not deny the significance of regional 
cooperation based on one region. But in achieving this, it would 
be more appropriate to view Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, 
North America, and Australia as one Asia-Pacific region (in the 
future, Southwest Asia may be included in this cooperative 
framework), instead of viewing Asia as one fixed unit. 
  The reason for this is that more and more countries of the 
Asia Pacific are recognizing that they do share some of the same 
problems and goals. Suppose that Asian countries would form some 
type of group by themselves. It should be the kind of 
organization that would support and reinforce the existing 
global framework or the whole Asia-Pacific framework. 
Narrow-minded "Asianism" may be interpreted as the solidarity 
and interests of nonwhite nations, and will not be desirable in 
light of Japan's relationship with other Asian countries in 
World War II. 
  Thus Japan's policy toward Asia should not be considered 
separately from its U.S. and European policy, as if we were to 
choose between the two. It should be discussed as a part of the 
policy toward the Asia-Pacific region, and in relation to 
growing global interdependence. 
  There are many opportunities for dialogue and cooperation 
for 
the countries of the Asia Pacific, and in recent years, the 
importance of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is 
increasing. APEC is a still young organization, started in 1989 
by Australia's proposal. However, it has held five annual 
minister-level conferences, and has been discussing the region's 
deregulation of trade/investment, and economic trends. 
  Last November, APEC's informal summit meeting was held on 
the 
Blake Island off the coast of Seattle. For the first time, 14 
leaders from the Asia-Pacific region gathered for this historic 
meeting and discussed the economic trend of this region and the 
world and trade investment issues, and voted for the declaration 
concerning this region's economic prospect. This year, APEC's 
second summit meeting is planned in Indonesia. 
  As an attempt at regional economic cooperation by Asian 
countries, there is an idea for EAEC (East Asia Economic Caucus) 
advocated by Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia. When this plan 
was first proposed, it was called EAEG (East Asia Economic 
Group). Back then the object of the plan was supposed to be to 
create opportunities for conference (discussion) among the 
nations of East Asia, and as the next step, to form a new 
organization to reinforce the trade and economic links between 
these countries. 
  When this plan was proposed, the Uruguay Round negotiations 
were stalled, and some thought that this plan was to establish 
an "economic bloc" by Eastern Asia alone. At the same time, 
several countries pointed out that the contents of this plan 
were not clear enough. The Bush administration of the United 
States strongly opposed the plan, saying that "there is a 
possibility that this plan may divide the Pacific." 
  Since then, there have been repeated discussions within 
ASEAN, and the EAEC plan seems to have changed substantially in 
its characteristics. Nowadays, EAEC is basically a place for 
participants to discuss whatever subject they are interested in 
and is one conference group in the framework of APEC. 
  Japan has been cautious about EAEC, because the purpose of 
the organization and the detail of its concrete mechanism were 
not clear. However, as I mentioned before, the recent agreement 
in the Uruguay Round, the formation of NAFTA, realization of 
APEC's conference in Seattle, in addition to the progress of 
discussion within ASEAN, the situation concerning EAEC is 
definitely changing. Under these circumstances, it is time for 
Japan to reconsider EAEC, including whether to participate in it 
or not. 
  However, the following will be the prerequisites: 1) EAEC 
will not lead to formation of an economic bloc, and its purpose 
will be "open cooperation" in accordance with the principles of 
GATT; 2) its relationship with APEC will be clarified, and its 
activities should be easily understood by the members of APEC; 
3) it will not interfere with the U.S. participation (influence) 
in the Asia Pacific, and will give careful consideration to 
Australia's position. 
<H5>  Security and Japan-U.S.-China Relationship </H5>
  The environment concerning the security of the Asia Pacific 
is diverse and complex. Each country in this region has a 
different threat. Therefore, traditionally, their interests in 
security have been on a subregional basis, such as that of the 
Korean peninsula and Cambodia. This is why there has not been 
establishment of an organization encompassing the whole region 
as in Europe. 
  However, since the end of the cold war, there has been 
finally an increasing interest in discussing the security of the 
whole region. The "ASEAN Regional Forum" starting this year, 
which is a meeting held for the whole region, will include all 
the main players in the region, such as the United States, 
China, Russia, Japan, ASEAN, Australia, Korea, and Vietnam. 
  The following are Japan's main policies concerning the 
security issue in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  1. To maintain the presence of the U.S. military, which is 
the primary factor for the region's stabilization. And to 
maintain the Japan-U.S. security system, which is pivotal to the 
presence of the U.S. military. 
  2. To devise a solution concerning individual conflicts, 
such 
as the ones in the Korean peninsula, Cambodia, and the South 
China Sea, through the framework of the countries concerned. 
Today, the problem of North Korea's (Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons, is 
the greatest cause of instability in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  3. To promote political and security talks for the whole 
region, in order to increase the sense of security and 
understanding of the policies between the nations. It is a 
welcome development that the talks on politics and security have 
begun to take place in the ASEAN expanded foreign ministers 
conference, and the "ASEAN Regional Forum" is starting this 
year, both according to Japan's suggestion. 
  4. To invest in improvement of the security environment by 
promoting economic development of each country. 
  The common issues shared by the countries of the Asia 
Pacific 
concerning security after the end of the cold war can be 
summarized as follows: 1) How will the U.S. military presence 
affect in the future? 2) What direction will China's military 
capacity take? 3) What role will Japan play in this area in the 
future? And the countries in the region are closely watching how 
the relationship of Japan, the United States, and China will 
progress. 
  Many think that "the relationship of Japan, the United 
States, and China is so-called zero-sum." These people think 
that if the U.S.-China relationship takes a favorable turn, 
Japan-U.S. relationship will cool off, and if the former cools 
off, then the latter will take a favorable turn. It is true that 
until the end of the cold war, such an aspect existed in the 
relationship of these three countries. 
  However, looking back at the hundred-year history of the 
relationship of the three countries, it is also true that the 
recent 20 years have been the only period in which the 
relationship between Japan and China was basically good. The 
recent relationship of the three countries is an unprecedented 
situation, and I personally think that we should not look at 
this relationship as "zero-sum." 
  In other words, when the Japan-China relationship is 
basically good, the United States can develop its relationship 
with each of the two at the same time, and this will be 
profitable for the United States. Thus, it seems that it is an 
important task for the three nations to make their relationship 
"positive-sum." 
  At present, Japan and the United States share basic values, 
such as freedom, democracy, and a market economy system, and 
maintain an alliance relationship in security and a strong 
interdependent economic relationship. Most countries in the Asia 
Pacific strongly desire that this favorable relationship between 
Japan and the United States be maintained for the sake of their 
own security and prosperity. 
  On the other hand, concerning Japan-China relations, both 
countries are aiming to establish a more mature relationship. 
The relationship between the two has been generally good since 
the normalization of diplomatic relations. For Japan, 
maintaining and developing our friendship with China is a key 
point in its foreign policy. Japan has been cooperating as much 
as possible to China's modernization, according to its belief 
that China's continued reform and open-door policies will help 
the region's security and prosperity. Also, Japan thinks that it 
is important for China to deal constructively with the 
frameworks of multiple countries (for example, NPT [nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty], MTCR [Missile Technology Control 
Regime] and GATT). 
  Furthermore, Japan strongly hopes that the objectives and 
contents of China's policies concerning its military 
modernization will become clearer. Continued discussion on 
security between Japan and China and China's participation in 
the "ASEAN Regional Forum" to discuss politics and security in 
the whole region will contribute greatly to building trust and a 
sense of security among the countries of this region. 
  As for the U.S.-China relationship, both countries have been 
trying to improve the relationship since the Tiananmen Square 
incident, each recognizing the importance of the other. However, 
problems remain to be dealt with, such as China's human rights 
policy, the nonproliferation issue, and the trade imbalance 
between the two countries. Among these issues, the greatest 
pending problem is the human rights issue. 
  Improvement of the U.S.-China relationship will benefit 
Asia-Pacific countries, including Japan, and Japan should not 
withhold its effort in helping them better their relationship. 
Here, too, Japan's course should not be "choosing between the 
two," the United States or Asia--in this case, China. 
<H5>  Human Rights and Japan's Asian Policy </H5>
  In the Asia Pacific, the interests and policies of the 
developed countries, such as the United States and Australia, 
and those of the developing countries do not always agree. 
Reaction to the human rights issue is a typical example. 
  Japan often finds itself "caught in between" the developed 
nations and the developing nations concerning the human rights 
issue in Asia. However, that's a matter of opinion. Viewed from 
another angle, in this very type of issue, Japan, which places 
itself in the category of developed industrial and democratic 
nations, while being a member in the Asian community, may be 
able to play a unique diplomatic role. 
  In the human rights argument, developed nations insist on 
the 
universal human rights protection of individuals, regardless of 
the degree of economic development. On the other hand, the 
developing nations generally insist on considering each 
country's political/social situations and degree of economic 
development in protecting human rights. Also, the developing 
nations' position is that the human rights issue is a domestic 
issue which concerns sovereignty. 
  The summary of Japan's basic opinion is as follows: 1) Human 
rights is not a value that only the Western nations possess. It 
is universal. Therefore, human rights is an important factor in 
diplomacy. 2) However, concerning diplomatic effort in 
protection and expansion of human rights, it is appropriate to 
take the most practical and realistic approach, through 
understanding individual countries' situations, and the 
confronting approach may not always be effective. 
  With this point of view, Japan has had its own unique 
policies toward China after the Tienanmen Square incident, 
Indonesia after the East Timor incident in 1992, and the current 
Burma. (The approaches the countries of the West take do not 
always agree either.) 
  These policies do not mean that Japan sides with some of the 
developing countries that insist that human rights is a domestic 
issue which concerns each country's sovereignty. Neither do they 
mean that Japan agrees to the argument that the "rights" of 
political stability and economic development should have 
priority over civil and political rights. 
  While Japan understands to a certain degree why there are 
such opinions as these, our position is that ceaseless effort is 
necessary to improve these situations, and fixation of the 
current situation or regression should not be allowed. 
  However, at the same time, in discussing the human rights 
issue in the developing nations, we must carefully consider 
social and political factors of these countries, such as whether 
there exists a large middle class, whether economic stability 
and development are maintained, and whether there exist 
political groups which protect freedom of speech and human 
rights. 
  Considering that it took a long time in the Western nations 
for these factors to be achieved, it may not be very realistic 
to demand and pressure the developing countries to have the same 
degree of human rights protection as in the developed countries. 
<H5>  Problem Concerning the Past </H5>
  When discussing Japan's Asian policy, we cannot avoid our 
"problem of the past" concerning Japan's actions before World 
War II. Unfortunately, there still are some countries in Asia 
which suspect that Japan has not fully repented of its past 
actions. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa called World War II "a war of 
aggression," and he also stated that "we regret it deeply and 
apologize from the bottom of our heart" referring to Japan's 
colonization of Korea in the past. Asian countries, including 
Korea, responded favorably, saying that his statement showed 
that Japan was looking at its past truthfully. 
  On the other hand, the series of prime minister's statements 
stirred up discussions about Japan's postwar conduct. 
  However, Japan has fulfilled its responsibilities, such as 
reparation, constantly and sincerely despite the difficult 
situation after the war, according to the San Francisco Peace 
Treaty and related bilateral treaties, and except for special 
cases, such as Taiwan and North Korea, Japan has settled the 
"postwar conduct issue" with each involved government. 
  As for the comfort women issue, the Japanese Government is 
seriously discussing how to express our feelings about it 
because of the uniqueness of the problem in which "women's honor 
and dignity were injured." 
  In order for Japan to put "past" problems behind and to 
develop relationships with our neighboring countries with 
prospect for the future, there are two things that are 
especially important for Japanese people. 
  One is that some measures should be taken in order to help 
the younger Japanese generation to better know and understand 
history. In recent years, there has been substantial improvement 
in the contents of school textbooks. However, to see this in an 
actual classroom environment, there should be more improvement 
in textbook content, such allocating more time to modern 
history. At the same time, I hope that these improvements in 
Japan will be understood and explained in foreign countries, 
including Asian countries. 
  The other is that we need to express our resolution not to 
repeat the same mistakes, not just by words, but by concrete 
actions. 
  In relation to this, dispatch of Japan's Self-Defense Forces 
for PKO [UN peacekeeping operations] activities in Cambodia was 
an epochal event in Japan's foreign policy. The bill for this 
deployment met strong criticism domestically, and some Asian 
countries criticized and feared that it might move Japan toward 
becoming a militaristic giant. However, the fact that Japanese 
PKO personnel truly contributed to Cambodia's peacekeeping 
despite many difficulties and at the sacrifice of lives, was 
enough to wipe away these criticisms and fear. These days, all 
Asian countries without exception understand that Japan's PKO 
activities in Cambodia were that of a responsible member of 
international society, and value them highly. 
  Thus, in order to wipe away the "past problem" image, Japan 
must show concrete actions one by one. This is a very 
time-consuming process. However, in order to overcome the 
negative inheritance of the past, there is no other way. 
  However, we should not hate ourselves for our past problem. 
The Asian countries' view of Japan is definitely changing with 
time. 
  At the same time, the hope these countries have in Japan is 
only expanding. There is no sign of its decreasing. The most 
critical issue for the relationship between Japan and the rest 
of Asia is how Japan will respond positively to meet their 
expectations. 
  The role Japanese economy played in the recent economic 
development of East Asia, the effect Japanese economic 
cooperation (ODA [official development assistance] grants) is 
having on these countries in improvement of infrastructure and 
public welfare, Japan's positive diplomatic participation and 
its role in political security (especially activities concerning 
peacekeeping in Cambodia and the situation in the Korean 
peninsula), the role the Japan-U.S. mutual security structure 
still plays in the stability of the Asia Pacific, etc., are 
major examples of Japan's positive involvement and its role. And 
the most effective way for Japan to meet the expectation of the 
Asian countries would be to deepen and expand these involvements 
and roles.

  [Text] On the issue of achieving a drastic reform of the 
tax system by the end of the year, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
declared in the House of Councillors' Budget Committee session 
on 9 June that passing the related legislation is a public 
commitment of his administration: "Without a doubt, this is a 
public commitment. I also think it will be an important 
historic event." 
  Hata's remarks came in reply to a question posed by 
Toranosuke Katayama of the Liberal Democratic Party, who asked, 
"Is it correct to say that you are making a public commitment to 
formulating the legislation by the end of June and having the 
Diet pass it by the end of the year?" Asked about the political 
responsibility he might assume in case of failing to achieve the 
reform, however, Hata only said, "I want to tackle the issue 
seriously."

  [Text] Kan Kato, chairman of the Government Tax Commission 
(prime minister's advisory panel;, Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of 
the Economic Council (prime minister's advisory panel); and Eiji 
Suzuki, chairman of the Financial Systems Council (finance 
minister's advisory panel) held a meeting at a hotel in Tokyo on 
the morning of 6 June, and agreed that administrative reform and 
tax reform should come together to gain the public's 
understanding on the need for drastic tax reform accompanying a 
raise in the consumption tax rate. 
  Specifically, they agreed it would be necessary to formulate 
an "administrative reform five-year plan" which will call for 
the merger or abolition of special status corporations and for 
reductions of commodity prices by remedying existing gaps in 
prices between Japan and other countries. They will work on 
Prime Minister Hata and Finance Minister Fujii with this 
recommendation. It is very rare that heads of these major 
councils charged with giving advice on economic operations agree 
on a concernted action. It is likely that Prime Minister Hata's 
leadership will be severely tested. 
  The meeting took place at the suggestion of Tax Commission 
Chairman Kato to Hiraiwa and Suzuki, and it was held in an 
informal manner. At the meeting, the three chairmen first of 
all agreed that to improve welfare service while upgrading the 
social overhead capital of Japan in the approaching era of aged 
population, increased financial burdens by the public would be 
unavoidable, and a rise in the consumption tax rate would be 
necessary. They further agreed that if the public burdens are 
to be eased somewhat under the given conditions, it would be 
essential that the governmenet make efforts to carry out 
administrative reform in parallel with tax reform, and that the 
Tax Commission and the two councils should, in the course of 
conducting deliberations in their respective organizations, 
should call strongly on the government to move administrtative 
reform into actions. As actions that need to be taken by the 
government, they cited the formulation of a "[central 
government] administrative reform five-year plan" and a "local 
government administratve reform five-year plan" which will show 
what government projects and special status corporations should 
be merged or abolished in what year, the correction of commodity 
price gaps between Japan and other countries by making headway 
in deregulation, and the revision of the way the public utility 
charges' rates are decided. 
  Following the three chairmen's meeting, Chairman Kato of the 
Tax Commission told reporters: "The common view of the three 
chairman is that thinking about the Japan of the 21st century, 
tax reform and administratiive reform should be carried out 
concurrently. Some in the Financial Systems Council insist 
administrative reform should be specific (so that it might 
contribute to reduction of expenditures). In the future, I think 
the Tax Commission and the Financial System Council will come to 
work in particularly close cooperation."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article in two installments: "Tax Reform Takes </F>
Center Stage--Fluid Political Situation"] [14 Apr 94 p 5] 
  [Text] Following the coalition parties' Tax Reform 
Committee, the government Tax Commission (prime minister's 
advisory organ) was installed on 8 April. The main focus will be 
to provide a response to the issue of raising the consumption 
tax rate, which had been shelved, since the national welfare tax 
concept was brought up. An investigation was made as to how the 
tax reform might progress amidst turbid circumstances, including 
the fluid political situation. 
<H5>  "Lead Tax Reform" </H5>
  "Ultimately, regardless of the political regime that is 
formed, only the government Tax Commission can lead the reform." 
These words were spoken by a certain senior official of the 
Ministry of Finance [MOF] on the morning of 13 April when 
speculations became rife about "Prime Minister Hata" succeeding 
Hosokawa. 
  A senior official of the MOF Tax Bureau states: "The final 
decision might be left to politics, but as long as there was a 
consultative inquiry, the government Tax Commission must 
naturally conduct deliberations to formulate a reply." Even if a 
Hata regime favoring tax reforms emerges, a political base in 
which a split has occurred might waver again at any time. 
  In past tax reforms, the Liberal Democratic Party's 
Researach 
Commission on the Tax System played the leading role and the 
government Tax Commission had the supporting role. Replacing the 
inexperienced government which emerged with the inauguation of 
the coalition regime last July, the government Tax Commission 
took the lead in discussions and proposed the consumption tax 
rate hikes. However, from the yearend into early this year, the 
ruling coalition parties expressed great dissatisfaction about 
MOF leadership so the Tax Commission was forced to hide in the 
political shadows. 
  Then came the sudden announcement of the national welfare 
tax 
concept in February. The MOF was criticized severely again for 
its high-handed action and, since March, it has cooperated 
patiently with the coalition parties' tax reform committee and 
adopted the strategy of laying the groundwork to present the 
government's "consumption tax rate hikes." However, the MOF 
posture is changing subtly because of the political instability. 
  The situation is such now that the tax reform bill will not 
progress unless the government Tax Commission steps into the 
forefront. The Tax Commission had planned to time the 
presentation of its consultative reply with the end of the 
ruling party's tax committee deliberations in late June, but the 
possibility is strong now that the release date of substantive 
conclusions will be advanced to impose a framework beforehand on 
the ruling parties' tax reform deliberations. Tax Commission 
chairman, Hiroshi Kato, who shares the MOF's thinking, is "firm" 
that "moving deliberations forward is a national task regardless 
of the makeup of the political regime." 
<H5>  Fact Is "Consultative Inquiry Was Requested" </H5>
  Justifications to push tax reforms are supporting that 
"firm" 
attitude. One justifying fact is that the consultative inquiry 
had already been requested when the prime minister announced his 
resignation. 
  There are claims that since the prime minister announced his 
resignation immediately after the inquiry was requested, the 
deliberations themselves should be done all over again, but the 
MOF asserts that, "as long as was precedent when the prime 
minister requesting the inquiry and the prime minister receiving 
the reply have not been the same person, the government Tax 
Commission receiving the consultative request had every right to 
enter into deliberations." 
  A senior official of the MOF Tax Bureau admits, "If Prime 
Minister Hosokawa had announced his resignation before the 
request was made to the Tax Commission, the schedule would have 
been disrupted greatly." Although it was a "close call," there 
is a world of a difference between receiving and not receiving 
the advisory request. 
  Actually, since 5 April, when Prime Minister Hosokawa leaked 
his intention to resign to upper house councilors Shimomura and 
Nishikawa, the MOF is believed to have sensed the changes in the 
prime minister's position and maneuvered behind the scenes to 
"have him, at least, submit a request for advisory 
deliberations." On 5 April, a ministerial secretariat's senior 
official judged that "situation appears serious--the coming week 
will be critical," and started to gather information. 
  The other justification is the revision of the fixed-rate 
tax 
reduction law. It was passed by the Diet in late March and, on 
that occasion, a "supplementary provision" was appended that 
income tax reductions would not be limited to the single fiscal 
year of 1994 but continued after 1995 on the assumption that 
drastic tax reforms will be carried out. 
  Actually, though there is only an understanding that both 
the 
ruling and opposition parties agreed to carry out the tax 
reforms faithfully, the MOF is making maximum use of the 
supplementary provision, claiming "it has the responsibility to 
carry out a law decided by the Diet." 
  The MOF adheres to that viewpoint in spite of the fact that 
at the time the law was passed, many remarked tauntingly that, 
"this is a strange law with the main provision limiting the tax 
reduction to 1994 and the supplementary provision mentioning the 
year after and later." After coordinating with the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence staff, the MOF incorporated this 
supplementary provision as an official commitment of "continued 
tax reductions" in the external economic reform plan announced 
in late March. 
  The MOF views the tax reform plan as being well buttressed. 
<H5>  Reform Is Uncertain </H5>
  The scenario could be disrupted if the political base wavers 
again, for some reason, forcing dissolution and general 
elections. If that happens, the government Tax Commission can 
suggest options but the political mechanism to consider them 
would be unavailable temporarily. For MOF authorities who were 
contemplating tax increases, the surprising support rate 
exceeding 70 percent recorded by the Hosokawa regime at the time 
of its installation was an unexpected reinforcement but the 
uncertain factor remains of what the support rate would be for 
the next regime. 
  The MOF believes that the next government would be a "tax 
reform regime." However, the people hate tax increases. Looking 
back, many cases can be found where political regimes and 
parties campaigning for tax reforms lost elections. It is still 
unclear as to whether the next government can really carry out 
the reforms. 
<H5>  [15 Apr 94 p 5] </H5>
  [Text] MOF Prepares Strategy Carefully--7-Percent 
Consumption Tax 
  It it were "a measure to cope with recession" last year, 
then 
it is "a measure to cope with aging" this year. The government 
Tax Commission officials think that this year's key words for 
tax reforms should be different from last year's. 
  The reason is that bright signs have begun to appear in the 
economy and the environment will now permit, accoding to Hiroshi 
Kato, Tax Commission chairman, "return to basic tax reform 
discussions on the best ways for the people to shoulder the 
burden of an aging society." 
<H5>  "National Consensus" and Understanding </H5>
  From 5.1 persons in 1990 to 3.6 in 2000 and 2.1 in 
2025--these figures show the number of workers (between 20 and 
64 years) supporting a single person, 65 years of age or older. 
With the increase in social security benefits, the tax burden 
must increase but under the current tax system which relies 
excessively on workers' income taxes, the weight of the tax 
burden will be felt even more. This led to the concept that, 
through graduated structural easing of income taxes and 
increases in indirect taxes, "it is necessary to equalize the 
generational tax burdens" (Tax Commission's interim reply made 
last November). 
  In its current deliberations, the Tax Commission will move 
another step forward and focus on the quantitative analysis of 
the people's tax burden required in the future. With the 
understanding that a national consensus was obtained to increase 
the ratio of indirect taxes, i.e., consumption taxes, the 
commission will even take up the concrete question of the rate 
of tax hikes. 
  The commission's deliberations will be focused on the 
scenario of increased people's burden in the future revealed in 
late March by the "welfare vision for an aging society 
discussion group" (unofficial discussion group of the welfare 
minister). This vision, which was revealed officially after 
detailed adjustments between the MOF and the Ministry of 
Welfare, was actually so designed that it will lead to a set 
conclusion. It might be said this is a schemed calculation to 
yield again the tax rate of 7 percent which Prime Ministger 
Hosokawa mentioned as a "rough estimate" in his national welfare 
tax concept. 
  If this scenario is viewed as the "most realistic case" (Tax 
Bureau senior official) to upgrade pension payments and medical 
services and improve nursing and child care, with respect to the 
future social welfare system, the ratio of the social welfare 
burden in the national income will rise from 13 percent in FY93 
to between 15 and 15.5 percent in FY2000. Keeping pace with 
this, the tax burden ratio of social welfare benefits will 
increase from 4.8 percent in FY93 to 6.5 percent in FY2000. 
  Including other charges (20.8 percent), separate from social 
security benefits, the entire tax burden ratio will rise from 
25.6 percent in FY93 to 27.3 percent in FY2000. Calculated on 
the basis of FY93 national income, that would be an increase of 
more than 6.1 trillion yen in the tax burden. The sales tax 
revenue was 6.822 trillion yen in FY93 (revised budget base) and 
converted to sales tax ratio, the tax burden increase would be 
approximately 2.7 percent. To obtain a round figure, the simple 
calculation is to add 3 percent to the current consumption tax 
ratio and round it off at 6 percent. 
<H5>  Vision Includes Social Assets </H5>
  The MOF must incorporate tax increase measures to make up 
for 
future income tax reductions. This is the reason why the MOF 
(Tax Bureau senior official) is asserting that the "minimum 
level of the consumption tax rate should be 7 percent," which 
includes an addition of little over 1 percent to the tax hike of 
little less than 3 percent mentioned in the vision. The basic 
plan drawn up by the MOF is already incorporated in the vision. 
  At the press interview following the second general meeting 
of the Tax Commission, chairman Kato stated, "The welfare 
expansion project is not limited to such matters as nursing care 
and includes public works investments for road improvements, 
etc." It was a statement indicating that consideration will be 
given to the tax burden of not only the welfare vision but of a 
wide range of financial demands that will arise in the future. 
  This is also related to the "external economic reform 
outline" of late March which stipulated supplementary additions 
to the basic public works investment plan to spend a total of 
430 trillion yen over a 10-year period from FY91 to FY2000. The 
reason is that the outline mentions that securing adequate 
revenue sources had been the preconditon to the inclusion of 
supplementary additions. 
  Is it possible to finance through tax hikes all of the 
steadily expanding fiscal demands, such as securing revenue 
sources to cover anticipated income tax losses for augmentation 
of the welfare program and providing for supplementary public 
works investments? In that case, "the consumption tax rate might 
climb to 10 or 15 percent" (Tax Commission official). However, 
such sudden tax hikes are not likely to be supported by the 
people. 
<H5>  Hesitant About Reassessing Expenditures </H5>
  To gain the people's support, a certain official states, "it 
is necessary to bring up the idea of conducting a radical 
reassessment of the expenditure structure which is being slanted 
to vested privileges by politics persuaded by special 
interests." However, the MOF is perplexed that "legally and 
realistically, the Tax Commission was not given the function to 
delve into and consider concrete details involving 
expenditures." The said ministry knows through experience that 
it is difficult to cut expenditures dominated by vested 
interests. 
  Increasing taxes while shelving the idea of reassessing the 
rigidified expenditure structure--if deliberations have to 
proceed under these conditions, the ideal of "creating a tax 
system to cope with an aging society," which the Tax Commission 
touts, might simply fade away.

"Introducing a System of Accountability to the Budget Process, 
Expanding the Role of the Judiciary in Anticipation of More 
Legal Disputes"] 
  [Text] 1. In order to prevent abuses from occurring in 
Japan's bureaucracy, it is necessary to strengthen the role of 
the prime minister and other top officials within government. 
Reform should be undertaken to strengthen the audit system, 
institute thorough post evaluations of the budget process, and 
move government toward a "system of accountability." 
  2. With greater deregulation and decentralization of 
government, there will also be a need to strengthen the role of 
the judiciary. Questions will arise abaout the training and 
education of those in the legal profession, including judges. It 
is time to look into reforming government in its entirety. 
  3. The "maximum mobilization system" that has been a 
characteristic of Japan's bureaucracy has created sectionalism 
among ministries and other government agencies, pitting them 
against each other for budget appropriations. 
  With Limited Personnel, Aiming for Maximum Effect 
  Japan's bureaucracy operates according to what can be called 
a "maximum resource mobilization and deployment system." This is 
a method to obtain maximum results from the resources 
(personnel, budget, etc.) that an organization has at its 
disposal. Japan's bureaucracy has been overly strained under 
this system to meet the demands of an extremely heavy workload. 
At the core of this system is competition among the various 
government agencies and ministries. Policy proposals coming from 
the bureaucracy have in large part been a result of this 
competition. When competition exists among organizational units, 
the horizontal authority structure or relationship among these 
units is clearly defined. On the other hand, the so-called 
division of labor within these units is only vaguely defined. 
Even when authority legally rests at the "top," special 
provisions will permit the decentralization of this authority 
within the unit. Moreover, the next deputy down the line is 
permitted to exercise the authority which has been delegated to 
him to make decisions and put his own official stamp to them. 
  Intense cooperation exists among the various vertical layers 
within a unit, and serves to mobilize all its resources and 
energy. The one large room where the unit chief and those under 
him work together without partitions and walls to separate them 
is the physical expression of this system of cooperation. Due to 
a heavy workload, it is not unusual for the workday to last well 
beyond 1700. Personnel management sustains this kind of devotion 
by maintaining a career-oriented system and scrupulous attention 
to career promotions. 
  What makes this maximum mobilization system work is the 
scarcity of available resources. Compared to other OECD 
countries, Japan's administrative agencies not only employ a 
relatively small number of public servants in total but operate 
on relatively small budgets. They also have "weak" authority, 
according to an analysis by John Haley. Haley, an American 
university professor, points out that, even though regulations 
and jurisdictional authority exist, existing laws often fail to 
provide sanctions against violators. This writer also once 
pointed out that, despite the importance of eminent domain, this 
right was not exercised by government because it lacked the 
authority to carry out such laws. 
  It should also be pointed out that, in addition to having to 
manage with limited resources, the bureaucracy has extensive 
responsibilities. This combination of scarce resources and broad 
jurisdiction compounds the need for maximum mobilization. 
  Maximum mobilization also applies outside the central system 
of ministries and public agencies. First of all, there is the 
tradition of regional governments. These local units have made 
it possible to maintain a small central administration. Instead 
of having the central government create local branch offices of 
its own, it delegates its work to these regional units. Thus, 
though regional administration increases in size and scope, the 
aggregate cost of government is reduced. Second, the 
administration works in partnership with various groups. The 
bureaucracy has created a number of industry and trade groups 
through which it tries to have its intentions known and accepted 
by the various sectors concerned. That it can exercise 
administrative guidance without direct authority is due to this 
tradition. 
  Recently, criticism has been directed at the bureaucracy, 
albeit only half seriously, to the effect that "[the system 
serves] the interests of the ministries, not the national 
interest." Of course, this criticism is fairly groundless. But 
it will be worth our while to pay attention to the frustrations 
that are behind this sort of criticism. 
  Bureaucrats play a very important role in the policymaking 
process. "But," doubting Thomases will ask, "when a policy 
fails, who takes responsibility?" "Can bureaucrats effect major 
shifts in policy on their own?" These kinds of concerns are 
behind recent criticisms of the bureaucracy. In truth, Japan's 
policies are in need of a change. For example, many critics are 
now pointing to the weaknesses of "convoy fleet" policies; in 
other words, the administration's attempts to protect industries 
by way of regulations has come under attack. On the whole, there 
is a strong demand for [less government intervention and] more 
private [initiative]. Though the demand is slightly different in 
the case of decentralization, this too being talked about. 
  These are demands for a basic shift in public policy. The 
age 
of "catch-up" modernization is over, and what critics are 
calling for is a basic change in Japan's existing value system. 
This trend can be seen in the recommendations of the Second 
Provisional Administrative Research Committee and later in the 
recommendations of the Council for the Promotion of 
Administrative Reform. There are also the Maekawa and Hiraiwa 
reports, both apparently in disagreement with the government's 
prescriptions for the economy. These are all recommendations in 
effect to change the basic premises of current policy. 
  Increasing Importance of Leadership Ability 
  The maximum mobilization system has brought sectionalism to 
Japan's ministries and government agencies. It has also brought 
about the kind of competitive behavior in making policy 
recommendations that puts their authors' self-interest first. 
How can such abuses be prevented? 
  The first step is to strengthen the top of the 
organizational 
pyramid, starting with the prime minister. In other words, it 
means making revisions in the maximum mobilization system as it 
applies to ministries and government agencies. 
  Cynics say this prescription is unreasonable, the 
bureaucracy 
is too strong. But is this really the case? Whether the ruling 
group represents a single party or a coalition of parties, the 
truism applies: "where there's a will, there's a way." Proof to 
this effect already exists. 
  We need think only of recent events. That a "solution" was 
reached at the Uruguay Round concerning the liberalization of 
Japan's rice market, that the Ministry of Construction is now 
attempting to switch to a general bidding system--aren't these 
in fact indications that the Hosokawa coalition government and 
its cabinet of "outsiders" have changed the direction of Japan's 
ministries? Compare this, then, to the period from the general 
elections on 18 July 1993 to 6 August, when [Morihiro] Hosokawa 
was nominated prime minister. Government during this period came 
to a standstill. Again, with the recent "fall" of the Hosokawa 
government, it was impossible to carry out budget deliberations 
for fiscal 1994, and government activities came to a long halt. 
  There are probably people who would say the rice market 
agreement had already all but been concluded and that changes to 
the bidding system were less a matter of who was in charge than 
a sign of the times. But policy doesn't come about merely 
because it is backed by the times or by public opinion; the will 
of the government's top leaders must be there to support it. As 
in other industrially advanced countries, the importance of 
national leadership at the very top levels of government has 
become more important than ever. 
  Reforming the way budgets are formulated--for example, 
having 
it done at the "top"--is an effective way [to strengthen the 
upper levels of government]. It is necessary to transfer the 
[Ministry of Finance's] Budget Bureau to the prime minister's 
Cabinet Secretariat or establish an entirely new process which 
links the prime minister's office and the Budget and Tax Bureaus. 
  The second direction which reform can take is to introduce 
certain "appropriateness" [outcome] standards to the evaluation 
of policy. While this will, of course, promote changes in 
policy, it will also act as a deterrent to the kind of 
competition for fiscal funds and the competition among policy 
recommendations one sees where everyone is fighting for a piece 
of the pie. Currently, those who evaluate budgets and personnel 
reshuffling do so in light of future plans rather than 
evaluating administrative activities in terms of audited 
results. It is more important to come up with a proposal that 
has the outer semblance of a good plan than to produce good 
results. 
  To cite a familiar example: A university researcher's past 
performance record will be of little use to him even for a grant 
to cover essential scientific research expenses. In the research 
application form, anticipated results seem to be the one and 
only standard. On the other hand, even if the applicant shows 
good potential, if his proposal is not well written, it will be 
rejected. There is no process whereby an applicant can get prior 
advice that will help him develop this potential. There seems to 
be only a "weak" willingness to pursue what is good or original. 
In other words, this is a system with very little sensitivity to 
quality--whether with regard to policy or research. 
  Results are secondary. What matters is being persuasive 
about 
the "appropriateness" of a proposal at the time that allocations 
are being made. By contrast, by revamping the external audit, 
which is based exclusively on legal criteria, and introducing 
appropriate [outcome-oriented] evaluation criteria, one has a 
system that can be applied to post-budget assessments. The 
results of this audit can then be reflected in the next round of 
budget appropriations. 
  In the present system, too, a method has been devised to 
rationalize one-time budget appropriations. The requester is 
made to establish a long-term plan and to provide a performance 
record for previous years. This is not, however, a thorough 
method for assessing the "appropriateness" of his request. 
  The recommendation, here, is to revamp the various functions 
of the existing audit system and introduce a method to provide 
for an outside evaluation. There are the Ministry of Finance's 
audit, which concerns fiscal efficiency, and the Management and 
Coordination Agency's administrative inspections [gyosei 
kansatsu], but at the present time, both of these have 
limited roles. The mainstay of Japan's audit system (what may 
properly be called an outside audit) is the audit conducted by 
the Board of Audit. It is required by the Constitution and is 
connected to the Diet's settlement process. 
  It would seem to be quite fitting to have the Board of Audit 
adopt the idea of an "appropriateness" audit. What is wanted 
here, in other words, is a system whereby the activities of our 
public administrators--i.e., the agents of government and 
society as represented by the Diet and the Japanese citizen and 
ultimately by the prime minister and Japan's national 
parties--can be assessed in terms of their outcomes and these 
results can then be applied to the work of government. 
  System of Accountability 
  Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the impact that 
such a system will have. Political scientists are constantly 
concerned about where authority is located. Where will 
decentralization or deregulation shift this authority? We must 
consider such matters very seriously. 
  Former National Land Agency vice minister Jun Shimokobe once 
said to those advocating decentralization: "Handing down 
authority increases the role of lawyers and the judiciary." To 
withdraw authority from one party is to assign it to another 
party. It has been Japan's system in the past to entrust most of 
this authority to the central administration. Before cutting 
back on its role, we should explore the possibility that, as the 
legislative functions [of elected officials] are restored, the 
role of the judiciary will also be coming more prominently to 
the fore. 
  That portion of authority relinquished by the central 
administration will be fought over in legal disputes pitting 
private citizens against each other and the private citizen 
against the public administrator. When this occurs, what becomes 
important is the educational background of the judge and his 
ability to make policy judgments. There will also be concerns, 
for example, about the quality of university education and the 
system that trains judges and the fact that the legal profession 
is represented by too few practitioners, including judges. 
  This article has explored one course that reform may 
take--namely, the shift from a system to maximize the 
mobilization of resources to a system of accountability. Any 
reform proposal needs to strike a balance and avoid the danger 
of discarding the strengths and merits of an existing system.

<F P=106> [By Himeji Dokkyo University Professor Yuichiro Tamura] </F>
  [Text] The life insurance industry is said to march in 
lockstep. I have compared it to a flock of wild geese flying 
through the sky. Except for the bird at the head of the 
formation, each one sees only the goose flying right in front 
of it. It is an industry with only a vague sense of 
responsibility. With the financial meltdown resulting from 
exchange losses and the collapse of the bubble economy, there is 
growing dissatisfaction with the industry and its inability to 
establish a clear locus of responsibility. 
<H5>  Life Insurance Industry at Crossroads </H5>
  According to the most recent figures, it appears likely that 
sales of new life insurance policies for the fiscal year ending 
31 March 1994 will be down for a second consecutive year. Is the 
life insurance industry, which used to pride itself on high 
growth, entering a period of low growth? Is this merely a 
temporary phenomenon, the result of a recession and two years of 
insurance premium rate hikes? 
  Even after the period of high growth ended, Japanese 
continued to purchase new life insurance policies. As a 
percentage of national income, Japanese currently hold more than 
double the amount of individual life insurance held by Americans 
and Canadians. Against the risk of death, the Japanese are 
today the most secure people in the world. Why are the Japanese 
so overinsured? The personal bonds upon which people used to 
rely are breaking down, and the nation is no longer as caring. 
People want security and peace of mind. This has worked to the 
advantage of an industry whose motto is "One can never have too 
much security." 
  This general sense of unease among the people was incited by 
the oil shocks, and they rushed en masse to purchase 
comprehensive insurance, whose popularity was well timed. The 
onset of the gradual aging of society and concern about the 
future solvency of the national pension fund contributed to the 
growth in private pension policies. "Uneasiness" alone fueled 
the growth of the life insurance industry. Certainly, the 
present Heisei recession has done nothing to alleviate this 
sense of unease among the populace. It is slowly becoming clear 
that companies cannot provide a safety net for employees and 
that lifetime employment is nothing but an illusion. Yet despite 
these new uncertainties, sales of personal insurance policies 
have declined. This suggests that the market has become 
saturated. Already, insurance premiums have reached their upper 
limit as a percentage of household budgets. In addition, 
insurance companies raised their premiums again this April. 
Unless very attractive new insurance policies are developed, 
demand should fall yet again. Needless to say, the future does 
not look bright. Life insurance, and the life insurance industry 
itself, may in fact have reached a turning point. 
<H5>  Marching in Lockstep </H5>
  Phrases are often used to describe an entire era. After the 
speculative bubble burst and the nation lapsed into the Heisei 
recession, phrases such as "the absence of checks and balances," 
"laxity," "lockstep," and "self-reliance" began to appear 
regularly in newspapers and magazines. Naturally, these were not 
words of praise. Even if they were prone to exaggerate, these 
journalists tended to expose the past and present ills of the 
Japanese economic system and to call for a revolution or rebirth 
of a new Japan. However, because both the critics who pointed 
out these ills and the system to which they belong are, after 
all, "Japanese," their efforts have tended to be futile. 
  A few of these phrases aptly describe the insurance 
industry. Take for example "lockstep" [yokonarabi]. 
Nobody has satisfactorily defined this term, but a certain image 
comes to mind. I imagine a flock of geese flying though the 
northern sky in a perfect V-formation. The bird at the head of 
the formation can see the sky around it and the earth below, but 
the other birds can only see the bird that is flying right in 
front of it. The insurance industry is the same way, for the 
"pecking order" of the companies has hardly changed in the half 
century since the end of the war. Even in the ultraconservative 
world of higher education, the ranking of universities has 
changed more. If one of the companies were to break ranks and 
contend for the lead, there would be complete chaos. Witness the 
disorder in the construction industry over changes in the 
bidding process. 
  Competition is said to have been intense in the life 
insurance industry. A former government official described it as 
"neck and neck." While this may have been the impression in the 
industry, there was competition in neither price (premiums) nor 
product development during this period. In the end, the amounts 
invested in business personnel determined business results. 
Because the amounts invested in staff depended on the financial 
strength of the individual companies, the rankings never changed. 
  The same was true in product competition. During the period 
of high inflation, many hoped that anti-inflation "variable 
amount" insurance policies would be introduced. Despite the fact 
that such insurance had the blessing of the Finance Ministry and 
the Insurance Commission, the industry did nothing. Instead 
they invested in fixed-term retirement plans, unleashing 
"multiplier competition" as they began offering policies paying 
10, 20, and 30 times the full-term insurance premiums in the 
case of ordinary or accidental death. The insurance companies 
eventually introduced "variable amount" policies during the 
bubble era when they were feeling invincible. This introduction 
was mistimed, as the collapse of the bubble economy has 
demonstrated. I find it amazing how insurance companies 
convinced themselves that the good times would continue 
indefinitely, and how quick their customers were to believe them. 
  For a long time, I have wondered why these companies 
introduced virtually identical policies and never seemed to 
improve upon them. Did these policies result from individual 
decisions? On the surface, these companies all insisted that 
they were offering a complete set of policies to meet their 
customers' every need. However, none of them seemed willing to 
place a high priority on creativity in order to develop original 
policies. Instead of meeting their customers' every need, these 
uniform policies ensured that these companies could maintain 
their share of the pie in a growing market. Will these companies 
now become more active in product development? They may have 
exhausted all of their ideas, but that is another story. 
  At one time there was much talk of lump-sum retirement 
policies, but the industry has not demonstrated much interest in 
the idea. If they have forecast that the current period of low 
interest rates will continue, the industry may with some 
justification be unable to offer such policies at the present 
time. However during the period of high interest rates, these 
were the same companies that boasted about their high rates of 
return. If they do not want to sell policies during periods of 
low interest rates, what good are they as insurance companies? 
They are consumed by unsophisticated concerns, which may be 
reflected in their decision to increase insurance premiums twice 
in the past two years. 
  Life insurance is supposed to provide peace of mind over a 
long period of time, during which business cycles go boom and 
bust, and unforeseen events such as structural reforms occur. 
Insurance companies must steer a straight path without incident, 
and not be led astray by the vicissitudes of the economy. 
Providing financial security for their many different customers 
is the primary duty of the life insurance industry. Therefore, 
it is imperative that these companies invest their assets 
wisely. None of these rock-solid insurance companies has ever 
gone bankrupt in their primary business, but most of them have 
been inept at managing their assets. 
  Recently, these companies have written off huge exchange 
losses and their latent profits have shrunk considerably. 
Somehow these companies have managed to squander the assets 
entrusted to them by their policyholders. Most of these managers 
believe this to be the result of the economic downturn. They 
believe there was nothing their company could have done. This 
explanation is somehow unsatisfactory to me. Need I mention the 
word "responsibility"? They are running at full speed with the 
palanquin of the gods on their shoulders. Are they about to go 
off a cliff? 
<H5>  System of "Policyholder Self-Rule" </H5>
  The majority of life insurance companies are mutual 
companies. It is difficult to explain what a mutual insurance 
company is adequately, but to use a metaphor boldly without fear 
of being misunderstood, it is a company comprised entirely of 
stockholders with voting rights based on the idea of "one man, 
one vote." However, because the number of policyholders [each 
one of whom is a shareholder] is so great, these companies 
cannot hold general stockholders meetings. For this reason, 
these mutual companies have decisionmaking bodies called 
membership representative boards through which select members 
represent them. Mutual insurance companies are built on the 
principle of "policyholder self-rule." 
  Membership representative is an honorary position. They 
serve 
without pay, yet bear heavy responsibilities. Membership 
representatives approve closing account estimates and decisions 
by the board of directors. Few if any membership representatives 
appear to be aware of their awesome responsibilities to manage 
huge amounts of assets, thousands of employees, and anywhere 
from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions policyholders. 
Lack of awareness is a serious problem. 
  I myself serve as a membership representative for an 
insurance company. The representative board at this company 
engages in lively debate on the tobacco issue and environmental 
problems, and this is a very good thing. However, I have noticed 
something else. Very few of the hundred-plus membership 
representatives appear to understand the nature of a mutual 
company or the gravity of their responsibilities. Until recently 
no life insurance company was faced with a crisis, and the 
membership representative boards would most often rubberstamp 
the decisions of the board of directors. They were a mere 
formality. On the off chance that an insurance company were to 
face bankruptcy, would the membership representative board 
completely abdicate its responsibilities? 
  Mutual companies are technically comprised of "members," not 
policyholders. However, the board of directors is comprised 
entirely of salaried employees. Is this arrangement as natural 
as it seems? True, in Japan the common stock company is not 
considered the mere property of the stockholders. But in the 
United States mutual companies often send out documents to 
policyholders beginning with the words, "This is your company." 
In Japan, these documents refer to the "customer." This is not 
mere rhetoric, because technically speaking the policyholder is 
not a customer. In the United States, policyholders sit on the 
boards of directors at mutual companies. At the very least, 
there is a chance that its decisions will reflect the interests 
of policyholders. Some also have standing committees comprised 
of policyholders that perform oversight functions. 
  The history of U.S. mutual companies begins in 1843. Since 
that time, there have been many colorful incidents in the long 
struggle at mutual companies between advocates of policyholder 
self-rule and managerial control. The problem is that there are 
significant discrepancies between the formal rights of 
policyholders and actual managerial control. These discrepancies 
result from the irreconcilable differences between the stated 
democratic structure of these companies and the realities of 
managerial autocracy. Congress has held detailed hearings on 
this problem, and the mass media and researchers have criticized 
them severely. In one extreme case, a company was forced to 
reform the way in which its board of directors was elected. I 
believe that mutual companies in the United States can be 
likened to a smoking volcano ready to erupt. 
  The situation is analogous in Japan. However, in the United 
States there are competent authorities to oversee matters, from 
the various committees in Congress to the "checks and balances" 
of the mass media. Competition in the United States is also much 
more intense. In comparison, the competent authorities in Japan 
have distorted market competition. So much for a system of 
checks and balances. To return to my earlier metaphor, the goose 
at the head of the formation is not the largest insurance 
company, it is the Ministry of Finance. 
  Many firms converted to mutual companies in the aftermath of 
World War II. Soon thereafter, the Insurance Commission passed 
reform measures concerning the structure of membership 
representative boards and the method of electing 
representatives. This is the source of the smoke emanating from 
the volcano; these reform measures were imposed from the 
outside. The ideal management structure should have been 
determined by the companies themselves. 
  Several years ago an official at one of the large city 
[money-center] banks wrote, "The insurance industry and the 
mutual company system lack adequate checks and balances." This 
statement initiated reforms of the mutual company system. Soon 
after, a "vote of confidence" was given to some obscure reform 
measures and these were adopted by several companies. At the 
time, industry leaders compared these reforms to "judges on a 
national board of examiners." Were they joking? Boards of 
examiners have serious responsibilities with direct bearing on 
the national interest. Most membership representatives are 
honorary delegates who serve without pay and receive answers 
from management only if their personal social status is high 
enough. Just how are they supposed to "oversee" the company? In 
addition, not enough information is made available to 
policyholders for them to determine who is competent to serve as 
a membership representative. 
  Policyholders entrust their assets to mutual companies, and 
it is the duty of these companies to provide financial security 
to them. Naturally, the day-to-day operation of the company 
should be left in charge of employees under the supervision of 
the managing directors. However, who should be responsible when 
it comes to providing oversight of management? We need to renew 
the debate on the essential nature of a mutual company. If the 
advantages of the mutual company system cannot be made clear, 
then these firms should consider reverting to joint-stock 
companies. 
<H5>  Japan-U.S. Insurance Trade Friction </H5>
  Then there is the problem of trade friction with the United 
States on the issue of insurance. As in the case of other 
companies, U.S. insurance companies complain that they have not 
been able to make significant inroads into the Japanese market. 
This is an impossible task. It is a market in which similar 
products are sold at similar prices. Competition is based on the 
size of sales staffs and their personal connections. Foreign 
firms, therefore, cannot possibly compete effectively. In order 
for foreign insurance companies to be successful in the Japanese 
market, they have to focus on creativity and devise superior 
products for niche markets such as cancer insurance. There are 
consumers out there who can recognize a truly superior product, 
but, needless to say, the market as a whole is a long way off 
from competition based on product innovation. 
  The problems facing life insurance companies are the same 
ones that face Japanese companies as a whole. In this sense, it 
is senseless to blame one industry. However, when one looks at 
the fact that life insurance companies sell security, and when 
one considers the fact that their sales method is to dispatch 
representatives to people's households and workplaces, few 
industries have such intimate ties to the daily lives of 
individual households. This industry has always claimed to take 
the interests of ordinary people seriously, and at best it has 
always wanted to base its decisions on their interests. It needs 
to receive frank advice if this is to become a reality.

<F P=106> [Report by Teresa Poole: "Kim IL-song Spells out Terms for </F>
Nuclear Peace"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- President Kim Il-song of North Korea is 
prepared to freeze his country's nuclear programme in return for 
US diplomatic recognition and other concessions, according to an 
American scholar who met him for three hours last Thursday. 
  Selig Harrison, an Asian affairs specialist, said in Beijing 
yesterday that Mr Kim wanted the US and other countries to 
guarantee that they would supply North Korea with a light water 
reactor if Pyongyang suspends what is widely viewed as an 
attempt to develop nuclear weapons. Mr Kim disclosed his terms 
as the US and South Korea prepared to impose sanctions on North 
Korea for not allowing international inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  North Korea, which says it will view sanctions as an act of 
war, threatened South Korea last week with devastation and 
warned that Japan would face "deserving punishment" if it joined 
an embargo. The crisis impelled President Bill Clinton to devote 
four hours of meetings at the White House on Friday to the 
sanctions question. 
  Mr Harrison, who met Mr Kim, 82, at a residence outside 
Pyongyang, described the dictator as an alert man who did not 
seem bent on nuclear confrontation. "I found him very sharp, 
very alert. We talked for two hours and he was absolutely 
forceful, and alert, and quick and sharp. After the two hours, 
at lunch, he was a little -- like anyone at 82 -- slower, and he 
wasn't talking as much. But he's walking well and seems fine." 
  He described Mr Kim's parting words: "He chainsmokes, and he 
shook his cigarette at me and threw down his matches, and said: 
'The point is we (the US and North Korea) must be on good terms 
with each other, and then we will both know everything about 
each other. And we mustn't put preconditions. How can you 
expect (us) to let a country with which we are still at war know 
everything about our country?" 
  Mr Harrison said North Korea would not build nuclear weapons 
if the US gave it diplomatic recognition and lifted the economic 
embargo in place since the 1950-53 war. North Korea also wants 
a US guarantee not to use nuclear weapons first on the Korean 
peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" from Larry Jagen -- from the "Current World </F>
Affairs" program] 
  [Text] In Burma, eight members of the main opposition 
party NLD -- National League for Democracy -- returned to the 
legal fold. According to Burmese Government news agencies, five 
elected representatives and three party organizers returned to 
the legal fold in the capital of Kachin State, Myitkyina, in 
northern Burma last week. 
  Two years ago, these gentlemen fled to the border area 
controlled by the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] and 
formed the NLD Liberated Area-North. BBC correspondent Larry 
Jagen dispatches the following report: 
  Dear Listeners: More than a week ago, eight members of the 
National League for Democracy, who set up their office in the 
armed group-controlled area of (Pagyawng) two years ago, brought 
down the NLD flag, closed the office, and headed for Myitkyina. 
  According to Burmese Television news, these NLD members 
returned to the legal fold after having gone into the jungle, 
but observers believe that they returned to Burma legally on 
their own volition because they were no longer permitted to 
continue to carry out their political activities. 
  According to a reliable opposition source, these eight 
people 
returned to Myitkyina to continue to work for regaining 
democratic rights in Burma. They returned to Myitkyina with the 
help of the Kachin armed group, the KIO. Not long ago, the KIO 
completed the singing of a cease-fire agreement with the 
military government. 
  A source in Kachin State says that since a cease-fire 
agreement has been signed, their return to mainland Burma is 
natural because they did not act as an armed opposition group. 
It says some of these politicians are from various parts of 
Kachin State, while others belong to a Burmese group from 
outside the KIO-controlled area. It also says that they were 
sent back to Myitkyina on their request. This kind of 
development will continue to be a problem because it has been 
learned that there were some activities going on long before the 
KIO signed the cease-fire agreement -- long before February. 
  According to the opposition source, these political leaders 
have wanted to return home since last year. These elected 
representatives planned to make the political transition 
[returning to the legal fold] after holding discussions with 
members of the exiled NCGUB, National Coalition Government of 
the Union of Burma, and other NLD elected representatives at the 
Manerplaw camp along the Thai-Burmese border last September. It 
says the KIO explained and prohibited them from making a 
political transition and arranged their journey back to 
(Pagyawng) camp through areas controlled by Wa ethnic nationals 
who have already reached a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese 
Government. According to the opposition source, these eight 
political leaders were disappointed by the influence of personal 
struggles and factions within the NLD movement in the border 
area. All of them are Kachin nationals and they were especially 
unhappy when none of them were invited to participate in the 
NCGUB, a move they perceived as racial discrimination within the 
exiled NLD movement. This political transition will badly 
affect the NCGUB and NLD groups based along the Burmese border. 
  After the NLD won 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in 
the 1990 general election, about 20 of its members fled to the 
border areas to continue the fight for democracy. However, this 
number is gradually dwindling. About a year ago, two prominent 
members of the NCGUB -- one in China and another in Thailand -- 
were killed. Moreover, another NCGUB minister returned to 
Rangoon early this year. According to the opposition source, 
after the return of five Kachin parliamentary representatives, 
there are now less than 10 opposition parliamentary 
representatives in the border area. But another two 
representatives, including U Daniel Aung [of the Lahu National 
Development Party], came to join the Manerplaw opposition 
movement last month.

<F P=106> [Interview with U Maung Maung Aye, information minister of </F>
the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, by 
unidentified BBC correspondent on 13 June; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] U Maung Maung Aye answered the following when asked 
why the NLD [National League for Democracy] members had to 
return to the legal fold. 
  [Aye] Concerning the return of the Kachin parliamentary 
representatives, we received the letter of the Organizational 
Committee of the National League for Democracy Liberated 
Area-North dated 27 March 1994 which was addressed to the 
Central Organizational Committee-Manerplaw, on 29 April 1994. 
The letter says [they] won't be able to properly discharge 
their duties and responsibilities given by the National 
Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and the National 
League for Democracy Liberated Area due to the cease-fire 
agreement between the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] and 
SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council]. The letter 
also says there are financial difficulties and security risks in 
carrying out their responsibilities outside KIO areas. It says 
they decided to return home because it is impossible to survive 
in the KIO area. Based on this letter, we perceive that the 
Kachin parliamentary representatives returned because they 
cannot survive in the KIO area. 
  [Correspondent] It has been learned that the Kachin 
parliamentary representatives were discouraged and disappointed 
because they were not given any responsibilities in the NLD's 
exiled government. Would you like to clarify this matter? 
  [Aye] It is not true. Our National Coalition Government of 
the Union of Burma was formed by parliamentary representatives. 
This is why our genuine desire is to expand the National 
Coalition Government of the Union of Burma especially by 
including parliamentary representatives who are ethnic 
nationals, and we have been striving for this for quite some 
time. The Kachin parliamentary representatives also knew this. 
This is why we would like to clarify that the report we have 
just heard is not true. 
  [Correspondent] How is the situation presently in the NLD's 
political movement? 
  [Aye] Yes, the return of the parliamentary representatives 
will not affect the NLD's political movement because while there 
are many who have returned to the legal fold, there are also 
considerable numbers of parliamentary representatives, NLD 
members, and people from other political parties who do not want 
to live under the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration 
Council], and have come to the liberated area during the 
revolutionary period. It is a natural phenomenon. Concerning 
this matter, there is no effect on our work being carried out on 
this side. It is because the communications between the NLD 
groups in the north and the Manerplaw central headquarters are 
very difficult. We would like to say that the return of the NLD 
members in the north will not affect the National League for 
Democracy's present and future activities because the NLD's 
political activities are operated from Manerplaw. 
  [Correspondent] How is the situation in the NLD's political 
movement in Thailand? 
  [Aye] Yes, it is true that we face more difficulties than 
before, but not to the extend that we cannot do our work at all. 
We can continue to survive and move around. We would like to 
say that we are continuing to do our regular work.

  [text][excerpts]-Yangon, 16 May--Secretary-2 of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council Lt-Gen Tin Oo addressed the 
opening ceremony of the Cooperative Market Festival at the 
Chanmya Thazi Department Store in Mandalay at 8:30 am today. 
  [Passage omitted]-The Secretary-2 said in his address that 
cooperative system enables those lacking strength to become 
strong economic organization to win a competitive edge in the 
market economic system. The country, he said, is practising 
market economy. In a market oriented system, he pointed out, 
people doing business will certainly encounter such conditions 
like insufficient supply of capital, weakness in commodity 
production technology, incompetence in the administrative skills 
and market instability. All those who are weak must cooperate 
and reciprocate one another to remedy the weaknesses, he said. 
This is cooperative way, he added. 
  He noted that the Cooperative Market Festival aims at 
securing vast markets for domestic products and strengthening 
the existing markets for the products. The cooperative 
societies, entrepreneurs and the public are to strive toward 
that end, he added. 
  The Cooperative Market Festival in itself is self-evident, 
he 
said. It involves trading, collective efforts and entertainment 
programmes. 
  Products of different localities, traditional costumes, 
works 
of art and traditional dishes will also be available at the 
festival thereby promoting and preserving cultural traditions, 
the Secretary-2 said. 
  He said the festival is vital for finding markets for 
domestic products, strengthening and expanding the existing ones 
and introducing new products in accordance with consumers' 
demand. 
  He said he believes acquiring new markets and producing new 
products will contribute toward realizing the Allround 
Development year in 1994-95. 
  The people of Mandalay Division and Mandalay can take pride 
for being able to organize the festival welcoming the Allround 
Development Year, he said. 
  The Secretary-2 looked forward to expanding trade as 
transactions are to be carried out through contracts at the 
festival. Cooperative societies, those engaged in cooperative 
undertakings and interested persons of the States and Divisions 
are converging on the festival. During their stay at the 
festival, they are said to be attending a seminar on upgrading 
and improving cooperative activities, he said. The seminar will 
concentrate on doing cooperative undertakings actively, boosting 
export and producing new items required by the markets, he said. 
  He underscored that stability is ensured in political, 
economic and administrative spheres in the country. The 
National Convention has made some progress in laying down 
principles to serve as base in drafting the State Constitution. 
Altogether 11 armed groups in the jungles have responded to the 
government offer, then returned to the legal fold and finally 
are implementing the regional development projects together with 
the government. 
  Economically, he said, short-term projects have been laid 
down and then implemented from 1992-93 to 1995-96. With the 
fulfilment of targets during the first and second years, firm 
economic bases have already been established, he said. Foreign 
nations are found to have invested more in the country and 
efforts are being mad3 with added momentum during the current 
fiscal year of 1994-95, the third which is designated as 
Allround Development Year. In the process, he said, cooperative 
societies are to play an important role. Cooperativie 
University and colleges are to be opened soon, he said. 
Cooperative undertakings, he said, have already engaged in 
agriculture, livestock breeding and fisheries and industries. 
They are also doing business in services such as transport, 
monetary and health care. In trading too, he said, they are 
making preparations to step up domestic and foreign trade. He 
urged cooperative societies to try their utmost as they are 
deeply involved in allround economic activities. 
  In conclusion, the Secretary-2 called on the cooperative 
societies to try to realize economic objectives of the State for 
the establishment of a modern and developed nation and also try 
to fulfil the objectives of the Cooperative Market Festival--to 
find markets through collective efforts, promote and preserve 
cultural traditions, develop commodity production, promote 
friendship and cooperation among cooperative societies and 
substitute imports.

  [text]-There is fresh evidence that the Khun Sa group is 
very much active refining opium, producing its most deadly 
derivative, heroin, which eventually finds its way to capitals 
of countries where the perpetrator of drug-related problems 
still finds allies, for obvious reasons. 
  Acetic anhydride, the most potent of precursor chemicals in 
the refining process, was on its way in bulk toward the 
tri-border area where the rogue has his den when a lightning 
raid by the Tatmadaw sent the caravan people running for dear 
life. 
  The chemicals, in 126 plastic containers, measure over 3,333 
litres. Calculating in terms of what those familiar with the 
process say, the end product would be 3,333 kilos of pure white 
heroin. 
  Where would the miscreant despatch that much of lethal 
powder? Wherever there is demand. That is why the Government 
here is pushing for demand reduction while striking at the root. 
  The interdiction of the chemical caravan also left 62 
pack-saddles in the hands of the law-enforcers. Plain reasoning 
will help deduce that there were in the trail 62 pack 
horses/mules. 
  Knowing they must jettison their precious contraband in 
order 
to save their lives, Khun Sa's men had taken to mule-back 
riding, which they would not have done under normal 
circumstances. Moreover, they had not crossed the Thanlwin and 
were still far from where they were holed out. 
  There were earlier occasions, as divulged yesterday, when 
similar chemical contraband was seized, meaning the law 
enforcement personnel were able to deprive the refineries of the 
most essential element. 
  From time to time, opium and various other forms of opiates 
and even psychotropic substances which were seized through 
Tatmadaw and police checks were destroyed in the presence of 
local and foreign newsmen, diplomats and other guests. 
  There are times when the wholesale producer of heroin is 
portrayed as hero by the Western media. Seldom is he made a 
villain. The way we in Myanmar see it, those like him who 
perpetrate such atrocities against humanity must be villains. 
  Anyone with enough sense in his head would not bother to 
argue on his behalf. Plainly put, a drug man, and those who 
lend that person support of any measure, must be treated as 
intent on and actually doing harm to society world-wide. 
  Caught red-handed. Indicted.

<F P=106> [By Sufi Yusoff] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Sat -- Malaysia denied the move by 
Russia to sell 18 MiG-29 fighter jets was part of that country's 
surplus defence equipment, adding the decision to buy was after 
a thorough aircraft evaluation, and tough negotiations on 
securing the best contract. 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak also denied 
that Russia was going to supply the air superiority fighter 
planes from its air force war surplus. 
  "What we will get will be new aircraft, and there is no 
question of dumping arms here to revive the so-called ailing 
Russian defence industry," he told the NEW SUNDAY TIMES here. 
  "We made a thorough evaluation of the aircraft before 
finally 
deciding on the purchase for the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF]," he said. 
  The negotiations for the US$550 million (RM1,419 million) 
[RM 
-- ringgit Malaysia] deal to be paid in cash and barter 
involving palm oil began two years ago. Seventy five per cent 
of the payment would be in cash and the rest in palm oil. 
  He was commenting on a AFP report last Thursday, quoting 
Russian political commentator Rustam Narzikulov as saying in the 
authoritive newspaper, SEVODNYA, that the June 7 contract 
amounted to dumping of Russian military technology on the world 
market. [passage omitted] 
  Najib said Narzikulov's statement was unfair criticism 
especially he was not aware of the tough evaluation of the 
aircraft by the RMAF and the protracted negotiations. 
  Under the contract, the RMAF had extracted a guarantee on 
the 
supply of spare parts, engine reliability and performance, 
integration of Soviet avionics with Western equipment, and the 
installation of the most advanced weapons systems. 
  Asked if Malaysia would have problems getting spare parts if 
the defence industries were to close down, he said: "I cannot 
comment on Russia's ailing defence industry, but under the deal, 
the Russian Government has made a commitment to supply us with 
the necessary spare parts." 
  He further said the success of the deal was as important to 
Malaysia as it was to Russia, and this alone would ensure they 
would not fumble on their contract commitments. 
  "This is because they see Malaysia as a stepping stone for 
them to break into the lucrative regional arms market," he said. 
  He added spare parts for the MiG-29s were easily available 
in 
other former Warsaw pact countries which are operating the 
aircraft, and India which has 60 such jets. 
  He said the contract, which stipulated the setting up of a 
US$220 million (RM572 million) Technical Service Center [TSC] on 
a joint venture basis between the government, the aircraft 
manufacturer, and the Russian defence export agency, was also 
another strategy to ensure adequate supplies of spare parts. 
  He said if it was economically viable, the TSC, to be set up 
after the arrival of the first MiG-29 next April would jointly 
manufacture certain aircraft components. 
  Najib also clarified the value of the deal was closer to 
US$550 million, and not US$600 (RM1.56 billion) as some 
newspapers had reported. 
  On the report which said Moscow chopped off US$65 million 
(RM169 million) from the initial price tag to clinch the deal, 
he said, a certain amount of "discounts" had been obtained in 
the process of negotiations. 
  However, he declined to say how much. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Japan has agreed to provide a 1.5 billion ringgit 
[Malaysian currency] soft loan to Malaysia for the construction 
of an airport from which British firms have been shut out. 
  Hideki Tanaka, a director of the Overseas Economic 
Cooperation Fund, OECF, which is extending the credit facility 
to Malaysia, said the loan could be signed between the end of 
this month and early July. It will be repaid over 25 years with 
a three percent annual interest. 
  The OECF, a non-profit body under Japan's Finance Ministry, 
regularly extends long-term loans at a low interest rate to help 
emerging economies in Southeast Asia and other developing 
countries. The Japanese fund has so far provided 15 loan 
packages to Malaysia with more than U.S.$5.1 billion since 1966, 
mostly for infrastructure projects. 
  Tanaka said the loan for the new Kuala Lumpur international 
airport followed a personal request by Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed to his former Japanese counterpart, Kiichi 
Miyazawa, in January last year.

  [Text] Melaka (Malaysia), June 13 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed said Monday that foreign investors 
particularly those from Taiwan should have no fear about 
investing in Malaysia as it does not oppress the Chinese 
community. 
  Some of the Taiwan investors had such fear and even 
considered Malaysia unsuitable for their investment because in 
the past there had been reports which depicted Malaysia as a 
country facing the problem of racial conflicts. 
  However, Taiwanese investors who came to Malaysia found the 
reports to be not true and there were no racial conflicts or 
oppression against the Chinese community, Dr Mahathir said when 
opening the [Malaysian ringgit] RM1,200 million (US$1 = RM2.6) 
Ornaetel Corporation (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd [private limited] 
factory at Air Keroh, near here. 
  We are not like other countries which oppress the Chinese 
community and we treat everyone equally. We support the opening 
of Chinese schools and there are no restrictions against the 
Chinese community, he said. 
  According to Dr Matathir, the Chinese community was the most 
prosperous in the world and there were Malaysian Chinese who 
were very much involved in business activities both locally and 
overseas. 
  He said Taiwan had contributed much to Malaysia's 
development 
and industrialisation process through its investment which at 
one time was the biggest when compared to that from other 
countries. 
  Malaysia at one time was merely a raw material producer such 
as tin and this could not contribute towards Malaysia becoming 
an industrialist nation. 
  Hence Malaysia sought a shortcut and invited foreign 
investors bringing along with them heavy and modern technology. 
  At present many investors from Europe, Japan, Taiwan, the 
United States and Australia and in fact from nearly the whole 
world have invested in Malaysia and have directly contributed 
towards its development, Dr Mahathir said. 
  No one who wants to work need be unemployed in Malaysia; at 
present more than one million foreigners have come to Malaysia 
either legally or illegally to work in this country because the 
wages offered are very much higher than in their own countries, 
Dr Mahathir said. 
  The presence of these foreigners in itself proved Malaysia's 
success, he said. 
  Responding to questions from Taiwan journalists covering the 
event, Dr Mahathir said the Malaysian Government welcomed the 
Look South policy of the Taiwan Government as it would draw more 
investors from Taiwan to invest in Malaysia.

  [Text] Kampung Gajah, Sat.-- The Government will take firm 
action against the Al-Arqam missionary group, including 
restricting its activities and possibly detaining its leaders, 
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayob said today. 
  He said the group's activities had reached a level which 
could divide Muslims and create tensions in the country. He 
said there were also elements of excessive devotion shown by 
some Al-Arqam members who appeared to believe that the group's 
leader Ashari Mohamed was the only person qualified to 
administer the country. 
  "Such elements could create tension among the Malays and 
cause fear among non-Muslims to the extent of undermining 
national security," he told reporters after opening the Bukit 
Chawi UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch general 
meeting here. 
  He said Al-Arqam had 10,000 committed members who were 
prepared to do anything on the orders of their leaders apart 
from 100,000 ordinary followers. 
  Megat Junid said Al-Arqam members had taken to calling 
Ashari 
"Abu Ya" (father) and were willing to do whatever he commanded 
for fear of being accused as traitors. 
  The ministry was working with the Islamic Centre to 
investigate the activities of Al-Arqam and 40 other missionary 
groups from the social and security aspects before taking 
further action, he added. He said the government assimilated 
Islamic values without force and provided good models to let 
non-Muslims make their own evaluation. 
  Asked whether Al-Arqam had been warned over its deviations, 
he said the government was waiting for the result of the Islamic 
Centre's investigation. 
  He said there had been occurrences of religious fanaticism 
in 
the past such as the destruction of temple images in Kerling and 
the attack on a police station in Batu Pahat which led to deaths. 
  "So the government does not want the activities of Al-Arqam 
and other missionary groups to cause a repeat of such 
incidents," he said. 
  Megat Junid also revealed the activity of a missionary group 
which practised recitations in candle-light and accompanied by 
the playing of drums and clarinets. 
  "Members of this group include the wives of well-to-do 
people 
and businessmen," he added. He said the group was motivated by 
self-gain and greed.

<F P=106> [From the "Comment" column: "Peace Return, Vultures Flock </F>
Back"] 
  [Text] The businessmen in Singapore, Bangkok, Tokyo and 
London who see the evening news on television and read their 
morning papers, all share a common viewpoint -- there is a 
terrible war going on in Cambodia and they feel compelled to 
invest their money in other countries. 
  Why such a negative view of Cambodia when peace is a reality 
and the Khmer Rouge are nothing more than bandits engaging in 
skirmishes with the Royal Army? 
  The answer lies with the foreign media who are vultures 
looking for carcasses. The foreign press are busy painting gory 
scenes of Cambodia, because even before the echoes of the 
resounding booms of artillery die down, more gunfire reports 
pour in. 
  Newspapers throughout the world resonate with "news" of the 
unfortunate war-ridden country, spewing out information, more 
information and even more information. In the process of 
tarnishing this country, foreign newsmen emerge as heroes to 
their employers, to other pressmen and to their own countries. 
  Meanwhile, in a small country, fighting the skirmishes of 
war 
and making valiant attempts to recover from its 20-year history 
of factional rivalry, Cambodia has also to contend with an enemy 
from within, namely the Western press it plays host to. 
  News reports are rife around the world about the country 
beset by war after war, although what Cambodia is currently 
facing are isolated incidents of skirmishes between guerrillas 
and the government of the day. 
  The Western defenders of rights and morality who constantly 
pound their Eastern lesser neighbours to a pulp over issues of 
rights, have no social conscience. 
  Why is it Westerners can lay claim to having an active 
conscience when it cannot even help salvage a country from its 
destituteness, but instead destroy it even more. 
  Why are pressmen who are usually so inhibited in their home 
country, and now let loose in a foreign country, suddenly 
indulging and even encouraging all hell to break loose. 
  Skirmishes are brought to a proportion larger than life when 
newsmen stationed in far-flung countries sending news to their 
headquarters, want to appear battle-fatigued in the eyes of 
their headquarter editors. In every foreign correspondent lurks 
a Rambo, waiting to shoot off his pen. 
  In addition to that, news correspondents have to battle 
stories generated from countries which have more to boast about 
than skirmishes -- real on-going, full scale wars in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda, Afghanistan, just to name a few. So 
competition amongst foreign correspondents to churn out the 
goriest, most sensational, most destabilising stories is a real 
fact of being `one-up' on the competitor. 
  Hence, the more gory, sensational and the more colourful a 
scene is painted, enables the foreign correspondents to appear 
even more heroic. 
  There is a time and a place for everything, and the time has 
passed for self-inflicted heroics. 
  It is time to do something constructive for the country 
instead of running it down. Perhaps the Western self-proclaimed 
protectors of the masses may consider writing the truth instead, 
if they cannot condescend to defending the masses of Cambodia 
and develop the country's needs.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 14 Jun (AKP) -- Mr. Chin Siat Yoon,

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Any dispute relating to foreign or 
local investments in this nation shall be brought by either 
party for conciliation to the Cambodian Investment Board (CIB). 
  CIB, as provided for under the yet to be ratified Investment 
Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia, is empowered to provide its 
opinion on the settlement of disputes. However, as far as 
possible, the disputes should be settled amicably through 
consultation between the parties in question. 
  Should CIB not render any opinion within one month from the 
first request to provide such an opinion, or in the event of a 
disagreement by one of the parties with the opinion, the dispute 
shall be definitely settled through binding arbitration here, in 
accordance with the rules of the United Nations Commission for 
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). This shall apply unless 
other arbitration procedures and places have been agreed upon by 
the parties or are provided for under an international treaty. 
  In the event an approved company intends to end its activity 
in the kingdom, it will have to inform the CIB through an 
official letter, mentioning the reasons for such a decision. 
  The Audit Department of the Cambodian Development Council 
(CDC), shall have the responsibility of examining the cause of 
the dissolution intent and also to ensure that the company's 
potential creditors, suitors and taxes are properly settled 
before the entity can be officially dissolved. 
  Once the company's liabilities are being settled, it can 
transfer the remaining proceeds of its assets overseas or use 
them in the kingdom. 
  However, in the event that the dissolving company had used 
machineries and equipment which were imported duty free for less 
than three years, the company will have the obligation to pay 
the duties applicable to those machineries and equipment. 
  Among the incentives provided for by the Investment Law is 
the provision for a corporate tax rate of nine percent, 
non-taxation on the distribution of dividends or profits or 
proceeds of investments. A corporate tax exemption of up to 
eight years depending on the characteristics of the project and 
the priority of the government will also be considered. The 
corporate tax exemption shall be applicable from the year the 
project derives its first profits and a five-year loss carried 
forward shall be allowed where applicable. 
  These are some of the provisions made in (?39 sections of 
the) "Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia" which will act 
as the catalyst for industrial and investment growth in this 
nation.

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Two Vietnamese immigrants have been 
killed at a fishing lot at Plalay Meas, Kompong Chhnang 
Province, which is 90 kms north of the capital city. 
  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, through its embassy here, 
held the Khmer Rouge guerrillas accountable for the massacre. 
  The Embassy's open letter, received here recently, said an 
armed group of the Khmer Rouge stopped the fishing boat 
belonging to Le Van Tuong, 80, and his son Le Van Thanh, 20, who 
were claimed to have lived here for a very long time. 
  The guerrillas were reported to have abducted the two 
Vietnamese and beaten them to death on the heads with rowing 
oars. 
  The dead bodies were found afloat in the river recently by 
the bereaved family who were searching for the missing members, 
according to the Embassy. 
  The Embassy has criticised the local police for delaying 
further investigation when informed by a representative of the 
Vietnamese immigrants. 
  The Embassy also said another four Vietnamese residents were 
missing recently and their names and whereabouts have not been 
verified yet. 
  The Vietnamese government looks forward to assistance from 
the Royal Government in investigating and taking effective 
measures to prevent the recurrence of the incident. 
  As far as illegal immigration is concerned a number of 
newspapers here strongly condemned the Vietnamese government for 
what they call encouraging Vietnamese migration to this country, 
while the Royal Government has not been able to tackle the 
problems of mismanagement and loose administrations within the 
concerned authorities. 
  The newspaper SAKOL recently said "the influx of Vietnamese 
immigrants into this country reveals the long-term objective of 
the late communist hardliner `Ho Chi Minh' who wished to annex 
and swallow Cambodia two decades ago". 
  "There are new Vietnamese squatters at Chrang Chamres, near 
Monivong Bridge, who cannot speak a word in the Khmer language," 
the paper reported. 
  The paper accused the Royal Government of being indifferent 
to the increasing number of illegal immigrants. 
  However, the Royal Government has managed to resolve some of 
these immigration problems. 
  Reports from Takeo Province said about 50 armed Vietnamese 
people have agreed to withdraw from Boreicholasa District where 
they came from and did farming without the knowledge or 
permission of the host district governor. 
  Previously, they illegally encroached on the nation's 
territory 70 metres deep and 1,500 metres long for rice farming. 
  After several rounds of negotiations, the two governors of 
Takeo-Cambodia and An Giang-Vietnam finally reached a solution. 
  It should be noted that the National Assembly has already 
adopted the Immigration Law but the implementation is rather 
slow.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 14 Jun (AKP) -- Following is the 
declaration made on 10 June by His Majesty the King of Cambodia: 
  "This week in Cambodia, the civil war that, alas, continues 
to rage and that pits units of the Cambodian Royal Armed Forces 
against those of the Khmer Rouge, has produced hundreds of 
victims among our innocent civilian compatriots, that is, nearly 
100 killed and more than 100 seriously wounded (men and women 
and old, adults, and children) not to mention scores of the 
slightly wounded and those who have survived but who have lost 
everything (houses burned, rice, fowl, and cattle lost, and so 
on)... 
  "In this civil war that, alas, slowly but surely advances 
through our motherland and pushes our people toward certain 
death, there is not nor will there be any victor or vanquished 
among the belligerents on either side. There is and will be 
only a great loser, the innocent little people of Cambodia. 
  "I appeal to all belligerents to have pity for these people 
who, for 24 years now, have suffered and still suffer so much. 
  "I ask them to please totally, immediately, and permanently 
end their war. 
  "Only total peace in Cambodia can save our motherland, our 
people, and our race from disappearing from the world map and 
the universal history."

  [Text] On 12 June, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, king 
of the Kingdom of Cambodia, graciously wrote a message to his 
beloved children, grandchildren, and compatriots. The content 
of this message is as follows: 
  Dear compatriots, the inter-Cambodian conference for peace 
and national reconciliation or the so-called Pyongyang 
roundtable ended with a negative result following a day's 
discussion because Democratic Kampuchea [DK] representing by His 
Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan refused to accept my proposal 
for an unconditional, immediate, complete, and permanent 
cease-fire for the sake of the entire Cambodian nation and 
people despite repeated appeals from Supreme Patriarch Tep Vong, 
Supreme Patriarch Buo Kri, Venerable Khousananda, and Venerable 
Patriarch Mongkol Tepeacha. The DK party replied that before 
such a cease-fire is imposed, the Royal Government must first 
accept a minimal policy program of the DK party. 
  Therefore, the second roundtable to be held at the Royal 
Palace in Phnom Penh on 15 June 1994 under the chairmanship of 
Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, my high representative, and 
with the participation of the representatives of Samdech Chea 
Sim, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and 
H.E. Khieu Samphan will first discuss that minimal policy 
program. 
  But if following a hard discussion at the roundtable at the 
Phnom Penh Royal Palace there is still the same failure as at 
the Chhanghsu-on roundtable in Pyongyang, I, Norodom Sihanouk, 
will not propose any other roundtables. 
  Any person or party responsible for the war in Cambodia 
[words indistinct] must be responsible for his/its actions 
before the nation, people, and history of Cambodia. 
  I deeply regret that certain persons or certain parties 
still 
place personal interests and ambitions above the interests of 
their own motherland, people, and race. If these persons and 
parties place the noble and vital interests of Cambodia and 
those of the Cambodian people above their own interests and 
ambitions, Cambodia will quickly return to the noble state that 
it was in the Angkorian times. 
  Dear compatriots, please accept my sincerity and enjoy five 
blessings of Lord Buddha for longevity, social prestige, 
happiness, strength, and enlightenment.

<F P=106> [Report by Brian Hansford in Phnom Penh] </F>
  [Text] For Cambodian second prime minister Hun Sen, history 
is everything. 
  He is optimistic about Cambodia's situation compared with 
that in the 1980s when he was the communist state's prime 
minister. But he is pessimistic about achieving a peaceful 
agreement with the group he calls an "historical inheritance", 
the Khmer Rouge, a group which begins another round of talks 
with the government in Phnom Penh tomorrow. 
  "There is no hope. Not little hope but no hope," said Hun 
Sen, referring to Wednesday's discussions. 
  "I'm almost fed up with talking to the Khmer Rouge. What I 
am doing is in accordance with the king's wishes. At least we 
would like to use the last chance for peace in Cambodia," he 
said in an exclusive interview last week. 
  Hun Sen gave the same gloomy message before leaving for last 
month's failed Cambodian peace talks in North Korea. The reason 
for such pessimism is Khmer Rouge strategy. 
  "I have a document written by Pol Pot and received in late 
March. The Khmer Rouge goal is to increase its armed forces to 
25,000 in two years from May 1994 to May 1996 and step to the 
stage of offensive," Hun Sen said. 
  Government information ministry spokesman Sieng La Presse 
said the guerrillas were trying to recruit villagers in 
Cambodia's north and west by offering money to volunteers and 
their families. 
  Despite recent military setbacks by government troops, 
particularly the rapid Khmer Rouge recapture of Pailin, Hun Sen 
claims the guerrillas are very weak. 
  "After their non-participation in the (UNTAC) peace process 
their strength has decreased equal to that of the 1970s," he 
said, referring to the Khmer Rouge remnants who fled the 
advancing Vietnamese army in 1979 after Hanoi's invasion toppled 
Pol Pot. 
  Sources close to the Khmer Rouge acknowledge supply problems 
but independent military analysts say the guerrillas can still 
total 20,000 troops including militia, although regular troops 
are estimated at 8,000. 
  But no matter its size, the Khmer Rouge remains active. The 
way to beat it, according to Hun Sen, is with a mixture of 
military stick and social progress. 
  "The powerful grenade which can destroy the guerrilla is 
development of the economy and society. 
  "We will not stand on one foot. We will stand on both -- 
meaning we will not use the gun and abandon development or 
develop our country and abandon the gun, but use both ways," he 
said. 
  Using "both ways" has meant Cambodian leaders asking for 
weapons. Foreign countries have responded cautiously to these 
requests, fearing an escalating civil war as the arms are sold 
to Khmer Rouge by corrupt, undisciplined Phnom Penh troops. 
  King Sihanouk described Cambodians as "champions of 
corruption before he left Phnom Penh 1 month, but Hun Sen sees 
corruption of government forces to a less extent. 
  "There is some corruption but not to the extent that all 
military aid would be sold to the Khmer Rouge even though we 
feel we have strengthen the discipline and efficiency of the 
army," he said. 
  Foreign countries which refuse to supply weapons could help 
in other ways, he said, hinting at military indiscipline 
problems which King Sihanouk recently said were alienating 
Cambodian villagers. 
  "Those countries who are concerned military aid will be sold 
to the Khmer Rouge can help us set up military training schools 
and also camps. The army does not have camps and stays in 
people's house so it is very difficult to control it, Hun Sen 
said. 
  He wants to throw the Khmer Rouge out of its Phnom Penh 
compound which it maintains under Cambodia's 1991 peace 
agreement. The government has already cut the guerrillas land 
and mobile telephone lines and state officials have banned 
guerrilla press conferences. 
  "I would like to outlaw them and force them to leave their 
compound as long as they do not participate in society there is 
no need to keep them as one political organisation," he said. 
  This will be debated by Cambodia's parliament at its next 
sitting. 
  Reports of Hun Sen's wanting to formally outlaw the 
guerrilla 
group are not new in Phnom Penh. But somewhat surprising during 
last week's interview was the Cambodian leader's conciliatory 
remarks toward Thailand. 
  When the Khmer Rouge recaptured its Pailin base on April 18, 
Cambodia's second prime minister accused Thailand of helping the 
guerrillas and threatened to raise the issue at the United 
Nations. Cambodia's First Prime Minister Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, and other Phnom Penh officials have repeatedly spoken 
of Thai "interference". But last week Hun Sen was more 
diplomatic. 
  "I suggest you should clearly quote my words. My concern is 
that there might be a misunderstanding between Phnom Penh and 
Bangkok. Thailand recognises only the royal government," the 
premier said. "The border is long. There are bad men from 
Thailand who hide themselves in Cambodia and there could be bad 
men from Cambodia hiding in Thailand. The Khmer Rouge problem 
is the aftermath of history," he said. 
  But for all Hun Sen's measured diplomacy the scale of the 
illicit border trade in logs and gems between Thai companies and 
the guerrillas remains a major worry. 
  The premier said country-to-country talks would always be 
the 
most effective way to solve Cambodia's border problems with all 
its neighbours, not just Thailand. 
  But he does not object to America raising concerns, at the 
ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in July, about alleged Thai support for 
the Khmer Rouge. 
  "A bilateral solution is the basic solution. That does not 
mean I oppose any talks by the foreign minister of America with 
ASEAN. The 1991 peace agreement's third part mentions guarantees 
of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Cambodia," he said. 
  Hun Sen has changed his rhetoric of conflict with Thailand 
into that of measured diplomacy. But there were no words of 
conciliation for his former comrades, the Khmer Rouge, a group 
he fled from in 1977 after almost 10 years in the revolution. 
  "I do not understand those who accuse me of being a 
hardliner 
toward the Khmer Rouge, I just raise the question of whether to 
arrest the thief and imprison it or leave it to live with the 
people," Hun Sen said.

  [Text] On 11 June the people and the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] swept the invading forces of the 
two-headed government from Toek Chum commune to Spean Treng and 
from Prasat commune to Phnum Liep commune in Preah Net Preah 
District, Battambang Province. We completely liberated and and 
now control this area including the following nine villages: 
Rouch, Spean, Toek Chum, Cha, Kouk Siem, Toek Haoch, Aumal, 
Anlung Cha, and Bat Trang. 
  We killed or wounded a number of enemy soldiers and seized 
15 
assorted firearms and a quantity of ammunition and war materiel. 
  The people also joined hands in destroying the Phnum Liep 
bridge to deprive the communist Vietnamese puppets and 
two-headed government of its use for transporting troops and 
ammunition in their operations to persecute, kill, and rob the 
local people.

<F P=106> [Column by Samret Sar: "The Logging War in Koh Kong </F>
Province Has Not Ended Yet. Who Should Be Responsible?"] 
  [Text] According to a report from Koh Kong Province, in an 
operation launched on the night of 8 June, the combined 
ministerial team for cracking down on illegal smuggling along 
the Sre Ambel Pass held up a barge trying to smuggle processed 
wood out of the country. 
  The head of the team reported: While we were holding up the 
barge, three motor boats from Koh Kong Province's combined team 
(one of which belongs to the provincial office of forestry and 
wildlife) led by Ung Voan, second deputy governor of Koh Kong, 
surrounded the inter-ministerial team's motor boat, directing 
all their spotlights on it as a threat. Seeing that it was 
outnumbered by the Koh Kong provincial team, the combined 
ministerial team then released the timber barge. 
  The report added that the inter-ministerial team also saw 22 
other timber barges tagging after the provincial boats out of 
that area. 
  This is the second time this week that the Koh Kong 
provincial team helped the timber barges get out of Andong Toek 
area, claiming that it would take action against the barges 
after bringing them to Koh Kong Province. In the first event on 
4 June, the Koh Kong team brought 12 barges carrying about 400 
cubic meters of processed wood out of this area, claiming that 
it would take action against the barges when they returned to 
Koh Kong Province. But not a single timber barge was seen in 
Koh Kong. When asked about it, the provincial team said that 
all the barges fled along the way. 
  The report said that these 23 barges carried a total of 750 
cubic meters of processed wood. 
  The sources of the inter-ministerial team reported that the 
timber carried in the 23 barges were worth about 5,500,000 Thai 
baht or 750 million riel. 
  It is not yet known whether this second batch of timber 
barges will arrive in Koh Kong or not since the first batch 
already failed to arrive. And if they do not arrive there, 
what measures will the Ministry of Interior take against Mr. Ung 
Voan? 
  The logging war in Koh Kong Province is still going on so 
terrifyingly. The bad consequences of such anarchy will only 
cause more complicated problems and distrust. 
  Those who have kept a close watch on this matter say: In 
such a situation, who will listen to whom and who is to be 
responsible for all the bad consequences?

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP June 13 -- His Majesty King Norodom 
Sihanouk has asked the government to release women and sick 
prisoners from its jails. 
  In his statement dated on June 10 and faxed from his 
residence in Beijing to the Cambodian co-premiers the king said, 
  "this current report brings me to ask that you free, for 
humanitarian reasons, the very sick prisoners and more 
particularly those who, in general, have not committed serious 
crimes or violent crimes". 
  "Many defendants who are particularly impoverished, notably 
the women, have stagnated in preventative detention for months 
or even years awaiting judgement", Sihanouk said in the 
statement, which was dated Friday. 
  Sihanouk said the freeing of sick prisoners would enable the 
country's penal authorities to improve prison conditions while 
waiting to find adequate financial means for the creation of new 
detention centres".

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Cambodian Investment Board [CIB], 
as the operational body of the Cambodian Development Council, 
will be empowered to render its decision on a normal investment 
project within 45 days from the day it receives the completed 
application form with all the relevant information, including 
feasibility and profitability studies. 
  The CIB, which will also be entrusted with the 
implementation 
of the soon to be ratified Investment Law of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, shall also publish its decision on the promotion of 
investment projects. 
  To enable this, it is empowered to inform potential foreign 
and local investors on the investment opportunities inn the 
kingdom, promote, analyse, evaluate and approve investment 
projects, study and identify investment and economic strategies, 
and assist and facilitate foreign and local investors by making 
the board a one-stop service organisation. 
  In addition to this, the CIB shall also issue an Investment 
Promotion Certificate to the promoted company in which the 
benefits and obligations of the company in one or more areas 
shall be clearly stated. 
  This ranges from amount and origin of capital, nationality 
of 
the investors and the number of shareholders and directors, the 
number of local and foreign staff, training schedules of local 
nationals, to details on the implementation schedule and details 
on benefits incentives granted. 
  The Investment Law, which is implemented by the CIB, shall 
govern investments made by foreign and local investors within 
the territory of the kingdom. 
  For the purpose of this law, investors may be either a 
person 
or a corporate entity. 
  Investments may be made in any economic activity or sector 
provided they have received prior written approval from the 
board and do not fall under section 16 of the law. 
  Section 16 of the law states that the CIB will not grant its 
approval on projects where activities and sectors are forbidden 
by the Constitution of the Kingdom, those listed in the 
restricted list issued by the board and that which involves 
trading and activities which the board has confirmed by written 
notice to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Commerce. 
  The Investment Law also supersedes any other existing 
investment law and calls for non-discriminatory treatment of 
both local and foreign nationals in respect to all rights, 
benefits, guarantees and obligations attendant to their 
investments, except for ownership of land as specified in the 
said law. 
  Under the law, the government has guaranteed that it shall 
not expropriate, nationalise or take any measures having the 
same or similar effect with respect to investments established 
in this nation. 
  The government shall not impose price control on the 
products 
or services of the promoted company. 
  The Investment Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia stipulates the 
guideline on the benefits and obligations related to private 
investments here. 
  Its objective is to attract investments that could sustain 
the economic development of this nation and contribute to the 
building of a strong and dynamic private sector. 
  It is also designed to boost the competitive advantage of 
this nation among other nations, through a pragmatic economic 
policy in line with the spirit of the free market system in 
which the government will act as the facilitator of the private 
sector.

<F P=106> [Editorial from 14 June PASASON: "New Era of Laos-Myanmar </F>
Relations and Cooperation"] 
  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] General Than Shwe, chairman of 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] of the Union 
of Myanmar [Burma], and delegation paid an official visit to the 
LPDR from 9 to 13 June 1994 at the invitation of H.E. Nouhak 
Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR]. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and his delegation were accorded an 
honorable welcome by H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan and the 
Lao people in all places they visited. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and 
the delegation called on Khamtai Siphandon, chairman of the Lao 
People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, in a cordial and 
friendly atmosphere. They also visited various places of 
economic, historic, and cultural significance in the capital, 
Vientiane Province, and Luang Prabang Province. 
  Official talks between H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of 
the LPDR and delegation, and H.E. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of 
the SLORC of the Union of Myanmar, and delegation were held at 
the Hokham Presidential Office in Vientiane. The two sides 
informed each other of outstanding situations in their 
respective countries during their talks, which proceeded in a 
good atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding. 
They also exchanged views on international issues of common 
interest. The two sides expressed satisfaction over the 
increasing development of good relations of friendship and 
cooperation between the two countries of Laos and Myanmar. This 
development has been shown concretely through the exchanges of 
high-level delegations, the exchanges of visits between the 
peoples, and the settlement of various problems between the two 
countries on the basis of sincerity and mutual understanding. 
  Noteworthy is that following the visit, the Government of 
the 
LPDR and the Government of the Union of Myanmar have jointly 
signed three agreements -- namely the agreement on tourism 
cooperation between governments of the two countries, the 
agreement on the establishment of joint commission for bilateral 
cooperation, and the agreement between Government of the LPDR 
and Government of the Union of Myanmar on the permanent 
international boundary between the two countries along the 
Mekong River. These three agreements serve as a firm basis and 
mark a historical milestone for the further and fruitful 
enhancement, promotion, and expansion and the long duration of 
the existing, good relations of friendship and cooperation 
between Laos and Myanmar. The signing of the three agreements 
has proved the intention and desire of the two sides to promote 
and strengthen the relations and cooperation between the two 
countries on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual 
benefit, and complete respect of each other's sovereignty. 
  The success of the SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar 
and 
his delegation during this official visit to the LPDR marks the 
opening of a new era -- an era for the further strengthening, 
ever more profoundly and extensively, the relations and 
cooperation between the two countries and the fraternal 
friendship and affection between the two peoples of Laos and 
Myanmar. The Lao people would like to wholeheartedly hail the 
glorious success of the visit on this occasion. They pledge to 
do their utmost, together with the Myanmar people, to contribute 
to further developing the existing, good relations of friendship 
and cooperation between the two countries and fruitfully 
implementing the agreements on cooperation in various fields as 
already signed by the governments of the two countries. This 
will bring about concrete benefit to the two peoples of Laos and 
Myanmar and contribute to promoting and establishing peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation for development in this 
region and the rest of the world.

committee and chairman of the people's committee of Quang Tri 
Province of the SRV, signed a memorandum of cooperation between

  The memorandum stated that the two sides unanimously agreed 
on a cooperation plan in the economic, cultural, and social 
development and public security maintenance along the border of 
the two provinces. In addition, the two sides also agreed to 
open a 165-km route from Quang Tri Province to border crossing 
point No. 71 through the provisional border crossing point A-16 
and an 8-km road from Laos' Sam-oi District to the said crossing 
point in order to create favorable conditions to promote the 
relations and border trade between the peoples in the two 
provinces, for example between Sam-oi and Ta-oi Districts in 
Saravane Province and (Hoa) District in Quang Tri Province. 
  The delegation from the SRV's Quang Tri Province paid a 
working visit to Saravane Province on 5 and 6 June. During the

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos and visiting Australian 
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans agreed on Monday to further 
strengthen the existing harmonious relations between their 
respective countries [word indistinct] trade and investment. 
The president and Minister Evans made the commitment during 
their 30-minute meeting in Malacanang [presidential office], 
which was also attended by Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto 
Romulo, Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez and 
Australian Ambassador Richard Smith. 
  Minister Evans assured the president of the Australian 
Government's continuing support to his administration as well as 
his personal commitment to help the Philippines obtain progress 
and development. Australia is the third largest economy in Asia 
and the 14th in the world, with 60 percent of its exports now 
going to the East Asian region. Minister Evans told the 
president he visited several investment centers including Subic 
Bay Free Port in Zambales and Davao City and General Santos City 
in Mindanao. Minister Evans visited Mindanao last 10 to 11 June 
with members of his official delegation to explore possibilities 
of linking Australia's northern territory with Mindanao. He 
informed the president of Australia's keen interest in the East 
ASEAN Growth Area or EAGA concept of economically grouping 
Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.

  [Text] Twenty out of the 21 Christian hostages have been 
finally released after being taken captive by the Abu Sayyaf 
group in Basilan for six days. The only remaining hostage is 
Father Cirilo Lacorda. The announcement was made by Armed 
Forces Chief General Arturo Enrile in a news conference last 
night at a military camp in Manila after receiving the report 
from Armed Forces Southern Command Chief Orlando Soriano. Based 
on the report, all the hostages, including 18 public school 
teachers, were freed Monday afternoon. Enrile said that the 
release of 20 Christian hostages was made possible with the 
intervention of the civilian negotiators led by Basilan Governor 
Gerry Salabudin to the local Abu Sayyaf leader Barhama Sali 
alias Amir. However, the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] 
Chief of Staff did not mention whether the demand of the 
kidnappers for a P[Philippine pesos] 1 million ransom for the 
safe release of the hostages was paid. There are reports that 
Gov. Salabudin paid P200,000.00 for the release of the 20 
hostages. 
  Earlier, government authorities met three of the five 
demands 
sought by the notorious group of Muslim-based bandits for the 
safe release of the hostages. Among these demands include: the 
reinstatement of 737 Basilan-based schoolteachers who were 
earlier terminated form service because they were not Civil 
Service eligibles; disallowing the wearing of short pants by 
female Muslim students during physical education activities and 
allowing them to wear turbans while inside the campus and not to 
allow military and police authorities to interfere with the 
ongoing negotiations between the government and the bandits led 
by (Juljilang). 
  The Abu Sayyaf group is also demanding the suspension of 
military and police offensives in Basilan. However, AFP Chief 
Arturo Enrile said that despite the safe release of the 
hostages, massive military operations will resume against the 
dreaded extreme Muslim fundamentalists operating in the 
Provinces of Sulu, Basilan, Maguindanao, Cotabato and in the 
cities of Zamboanga, Davao, Cotabato and General Santos. 
General Enrile deployed a battalion of marine contingents from 
Luzon to provide reinforcement to the government forces in 
Mindanao.

  [Text] Senator Santanina Rasul suspects the terrorist Abu 
Sayyaf group is being supported by the military. According to 
Rasul, several persons have told her they saw the military 
helping some active members of the Abu Sayyaf group. 
  [Begin Rasul recording in English] There are those who feel 
that the Abu Sayyaf or some people in the Abu Sayyaf are 
supported by the military. And I think the military should look 
into this angle -- that one of the leaders was seen being 
ferried by a PCF [expansion unknown], being ferried by a 
military chief, and escorted by military personnel in Basilan. 
  So again, this has given rise to suspicion that maybe the 
Abu 
Sayyaf are not really what they are. Maybe, it is something 
more that, [pause] more than meets the eye. But on my part, as 
a leader of this region -- as a Muslim leader -- I feel that 
this incident should not be used to project the idea of 
Muslim-Christian conflict. [end recording] 
  This statement followed information released by Criminal 
Investigation Service Regional Command 9, which stated that the 
firearms confiscated from Mujin Aminudin who is allegedly the 
supply officer of Abu Sayyaf, came from the Logistics Command of 
the Armed Forces of the Philippines at Camp Aguinaldo. 
  Senator Rasul also said that the root cause of the Abu 
Sayyaf 
problem is attributed to the slow pace of the government's peace 
talks with the Muslim rebels, as well as the military's failure 
to grant Abu Sayyaf's earlier requests on their previous 
kidnapping operations. 
  [Begin Rasul recording in English] So, I think we have to 
fast track this peace process with the Moro National Liberation 
Front [MNLF]. Otherwise, we will find ourselves on the losing 
end. The people who should be supporting the government might 
be incited by this extremist group to join forces with them 
because they feel that nothing much is happening in the peace 
talks between the MNLF and the government. [end recording]

  [Text] President Ramos rejected suggestions that the 
Philippines should imitate other Southeast Asian countries in 
using authoritarian methods to promote economic growth. Ramos 
said that the Philippines' often chaotic democracy should not be 
blamed for its failure to match the rapid growth of other 
countries in the region. The president said that when the 
Philippines was placed under martial law in 1972, economy 
suffered badly, resulting in greater misery for ordinary 
Filipinos.

  [Text] The country's balance of payments (BoP) position 
dipped by 4.64 percent to a $616 million surplus during the 
first quarter compared with the year ago level of $646 million, 
according to the latest Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] figures 
released yesterday. 
  Foreign investments inflow primarily accounted for the 
surplus, posting a 203.18 percent increase to $1.619 billion 
from the year ago level of $534 million. 
  Of the total, $502 million was traced to the remittance in 
March of Arab American Oil Co. (Aramco) to the national 
government as payment for a 40 percent stake at Petron Corp. 
The Aramco proceeds accounted for 46 percent of the P1.085 
billion improvement in the foreign investments inflow. 
  The rate of outflows continued to outpace inflows during the 
quarter, climbing 285.25 percent to $1.071 billion from the year 
ago level of $278 million. 
  The Bangko Sentral data showed that unrecorded outflows, 
lodged under the "errors and omissions account," went down by 
10.28 percent to $192 million from the year ago level of $214 
million. 
  A source said the drop in the withdrawals of nonresidents 
may 
be due to the substantial influx of investments in government 
securities and bonds, which is usually associated with the hike 
in domestic interest rates. 
  Inflow of medium and long-term loans declined by 23 percent 
to $914 million from the year ago level of $1.187 billion. This 
may reflect the cautious stance taken by multilateral and 
bilateral institutions as the country negotiated for a 
three-year program with the International Monetary Fund. The 
IMF Executive Board is scheduled to take up the Philippine 
request for a $650 million facility before the end of the month. 
  Net short-term capital, including foreign borrowings with 
maturities of less than one year, registered a whopping 114.29 
percent increase as $45 million were repaid during the period. 
  The balance sheet was exacerbated by the trade deficit, 
which 
widened by 29.82 percent in the first quarter compared to the 
year ago level. Merchandise trade deficit totalled $1.663 
billion as import payments outpaced export receipts, posting a 
21.91 percent uptick to $4.579 billion. Export receipts, on the 
other hand, amounted to $2.916 billion, registered a 17.82 
percent hike from the year ago level of $2.475 billion. 
  The source pointed out the growth in import receipts could 
have been fuelled by speculations that the peso exchange value 
would continue to strengthen against the dollar. 
  Although remittances from overseas workers increased to 
$2.209 billion during the period, this failed to offset the 
24.69 percent growth in nonmerchandise trade payments totalling 
$1.389 billion. 
  The country's current account position showed a $676 million 
deficit. Receipts from invisibles, which include freight and 
merchandise insurance, travel and investment income, grew by 
8.38 percent to $194 million from the previous year's $179 
million. 
  Corresponding payments stood at $27 million, a surge of 
1,250 
percent from the year ago level of $2 million. 
  Other BoP accounts registered the following advances: 
  -- monetization of gold, $38 million or a 137.5 percent hike 
from the previous year's $16 million; and, 
  -- revaluation adjustments, $1 million, or a 97.14 percent 
decline from the year ago level of $35 million.

  [Text] On 10 June, U.S. Commerce Department Undersecretary 
Garten gave an interview to NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporters 
during his visit to Japan. On the Japan-U.S. framework talks, 
Garten declared: "We are not demanding numerical targets for 
market share and such." On whether the pledge to increase the 
number of sales outlets in Japan for foreign automobiles is 
equivalent to "numerical targets," he avoided a clear statement 
by saying: "Detailed discussion on negotiations is an issue for 
later," thus indicating that defining numerical targets remains 
to be done. Regarding Japan's official development assistance 
(ODA) projects, he remarked: "I understand that they are open to 
U.S. corporations, but I would like to see some effort being 
made on providing information on bidding and other complicated 
mechanisms." 
  In praising the reopening of the framework talks as "having 
gotten off to a good start," Undersecretary Garten stated he 
"would like to work to reach an agreement as soon as possible." 
Regarding the outlook for an agreement, however, he expressed 
the view: "There is no particular time limit. We have just 
begun detailed discussions, so now is not an appropriate time to 
predict when we will have an agreement." 
  Speaking about his intention -- expressed in an interview 
last week -- to demand expanded participation by U.S. 
corporations in Japanese ODA projects, Undersecretary Garten 
emphasized: "My statement has been a little misunderstood. I 
understand that ODA projects are open to foreign corporations." 
He then revealed his thinking: "What I mean is that I would 
like to see some effort made on providing information on bidding 
and other complicated mechanisms and to have it made easy for 
U.S. corporations to participate." 
  The undersecretary also touched on cooperation with Japan in 
multimedia and other advanced technologies in the 
telecommunications field: "It will be an important topic for 
future Japan-U.S. relations." Furthermore, he stated: "It 
will be necessary for both our countries to lead the world in 
such areas as intellectual property rights and the 
standardization of machine standards. 
  The Clinton administration is making an effort to help U.S. 
companies expand exports. Undersecretary Garten particularly 
expressed the ideas of strengthening the functions of the U.S. 
Export-Import Bank and backing exports by small and medium 
enterprises. He pointed out 10 countries that are expected to 
grow into promising export markets: South Korea, China, 
Indonesia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, 
Poland, and Turkey. Among those, he indicated that China and 
Indonesia "will become the highest-priority countries."

  [Text] A senior official of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI] disclosed on 13 June a plan to submit 
a proposal at Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks due to be held in 
Tokyo on 15 June to abolish the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord. 
  The official said: "The effects of abolishing the 
semiconductor accord will considered beneficial." Both 
countries are supposed to decided by the end of July whether or 
not the accord should be retained. 
  The official added: "The accord sets a bad example, and 
gives the United States an excuse to impose sanctions against 
Japan." 
  It seems, though, the Tokyo meeting faces heavy weather 
because the United States sees the accord as an example of a 
successful agreement between Japan and the United States. 
  The main purpose of the Tokyo meeting is to see if progress 
has been made in allowing foreign companies make inroads into 
Japanese markets. Prior to government-level discussions, a 
meeting of specialists began on 13 June to calculate the 
semiconductor market share enjoyed by foreign companies in the 
February-March period in 1994. 
  Japan has decided to look at the possibility of abolishing 
the semiconductor accord because it believes the United States 
should not "threaten us by hinting at the possibility of 
imposing sanctions on the grounds of market share."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Now that Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has 
discussed the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of 
nuclear arms with the ROK and China, the government intends to 
make a final decision on how to deal with the issue after the UN 
Security Council discusses sanctions against North Korea. 
  With regard to the announcement by North Korea on the 
evening 
of 13 June that it would withdraw from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] 
said: "We are not sure about its real intention." 
  However, since North Korea has not indicated it would also 
withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), MOFA is 
unable to determine whether the DPRK has now adopted a 
completely confrontational line. 
  MOFA is watching North Korean reaction when former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter pays a visit this week. According to a 
senior MOFA official some people in the ministry believe that 
"North Korea is still groping for a solution through dialogue." 
They see the behavior of the DPRK during Carter's visit as one 
indicator by which to judge the intention behind the 
announcement to withdraw from the IAEA. 
  Meanwhile, Kakizawa called ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
on 13 June to inform Han of the substance of his discussions on 
12 June with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen concerning the 
North Korean nuclear issue. Han expressed the hope that Japan 
would continue to exert efforts to persuade China to play a 
constructive role. The two foreign ministers confirmed that 
Japan and the ROK will keep in close contact.

  [Text] A top Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said on 
13 June: "If North Korea accepts inspections without fail, we 
can consider that [economic assistance]." He was commenting on 
a reported remark by DPRK (North Korean) President Kim Il-song 
that if cooperation was obtained in the DPRK's normalization of 
relations with the United States, and assistance was provided 
for its efforts to convert [existing nuclear reactors] to light 
water reactors, North Korea would cooperate with International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. 
  The official said that if North Korea accepted full 
inspections, it would be possible for Japan to consider economic 
aid.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar Television Network 
in Japanese at 1150 GMT on 11 June, in its "Sunday Project" 
program, carries a 20-minute recorded interview with Kim 
Myong-su, Study Department director under the Institute on 
Korean Affairs, a think tank affiliated with the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), by 
moderator Soichiro Tahara. 
  Asked whether the DPRK is working on developing nuclear 
weapons, Kim says: "That is completely absurd. The DPRK is not 
engaged in developing nuclear weapons." As to why the DPRK has 
failed to grant thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Kim says North 
Korea has actually let the IAEA conduct inspections, but notes 
that there have been some misunderstandings between the DPRK and 
the IAEA, pointing out that during negotiations between DPRK and 
IAEA officials, IAEA officials have not listened to what the 
DPRK had to say about how to conduct the inspections. Kim 
criticizes the double standards the United States and the IAEA 
adopts, noting that inspections are lenient toward pro-U.S. 
countries that have already developed nuclear weapons such as 
Israel and South Africa, while they are strict against anti-U.S. 
countries. 
  At 1154 GMT, Tahara asks why the DPRK continues to refuse 
thorough inspections if the country is not actually developing 
nuclear weapons and thus, has nothing to hide. Kim argues that 
the DPRK has refused inspections at the two undeclared 
facilities at Yongbyong because they are military installations 
which must be kept secret. He says the United States would not 
allow nuclear inspections at its military facilities if it were 
asked to do so. Tahara, however, retorts that the United States 
does not have to allow inspections of nuclear weapons since they 
are already recognized as nuclear weapons; he says the point of 
issue here is that the DPRK should prove it has nothing to hide. 
  The program resumes at 1205 GMT after a two minute 
commercial 
break. Kim says normal relations existed between the DPRK and 
the IAEA up until the Gulf war, but since then, the DPRK has 
become a scapegoat, a subsequent target of U.S. strategy 
following the attack against Iraq. 
  Asked if the DPRK would wage war if UN sanctions are 
imposed, 
Kim says the DPRK has only said that it would "respond to 
dialogue with dialogue and war with war." However, he adds that 
the DPRK would not be first to start a war. 
  At 1207 GMT, Tahara says the DPRK should be more open to 
foreign journalists to reduce misunderstanding and prevent 
incorrect information from circulating. He points out that 
international political commentator Yoichi Masuzoe, who is one 
of the regular guests on the program, has waited for two years 
since submitting a request to Chongnyon to visit the DPRK. Kim 
says the DPRK is concerned about DPRK bashing by foreign 
journalists and that may be one reason for its cautious stance. 
He says the actual situation in Pyongyang is calm and much 
different from how it is being described by the Japanese news 
media. 
  The interview ends at 1210 GMT.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 Jun Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] According to a report by delegation members, a 
group of Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] members met 
Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea [CCWPK] and concurrently chairman of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, at the Mansudae Assembly Hall on 
the morning of 13 June. The SDPJ delegation, led by Kazo 
Watanabe, director of the general affairs department of the SDPJ 
Central Executive Committee, is currently visiting the DPRK. 
  Watanabe and other delegation members stressed that the 
issue 
of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons should 
be resolved through dialogue. In response, Hwang reiterated 
North Korea's stand, saying: "We do not plan to possess nuclear 
weapons. We do not have the technology nor the funds necessary 
to develop such weapons."

  [Text] During the upper house Budget Committee session on 
13 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said the legality of using 
nuclear weapons "is not yet outlawed by existing international 
laws." 
  In a statement submitted to the International Court of 
Justice [ICJ], Japan dropped the phrase: "the use of nuclear 
arms is not necessarily a violation of positive international 
law." However, Hata noted the government has not revised its 
stance toward the issue. 
  On the other hand, Hata stressed Japan's policy of opposing 
any attempt to use nuclear weapons as a political tool. He 
said: "Japan must further promote the three non-nuclear 
principles. I have absolutely no intention of adopting policies 
to tolerate the use of nuclear arms." These remarks were made 
in reply to questions by Upper House Dietman, Shinei Kiyan (of 
the Niin Club). 
  When Councillor Koichiro Ueda (the Japan Communist Party) 
asked if the government has any intention to designate the 15 
August war memorial day as a national holiday, Hata responded 
positively, saying: "The day may be a holiday, or a special day 
to pray for peace. It is a good day for everyone to think about 
the past."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bureaucratic Diplomacy That Goes Against the </F>
People's Common Sense"] 
  [Text] Politics operates in the realm of common sense. 
Politics that strays greatly from the people's common sense not 
only invites their distrust but is unable to gain their support. 
What makes us venture to discuss the elements of such politics 
is that we feel appalled and even angered at the lack of common 
sense and crudeness of the recent Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
[MOFA] view concerning the use of nuclear weapons (the written 
statement to the International Court of Justice [ICJ]). 
  The written statement came with the World Health 
Organization's (WHO) request that the ICJ pass judgment on 
whether or not the use of nuclear weapons violates international 
law. MOFA officials put together a written statement in the 
name of the Japanese Government. Initially, the written 
statement declared: "One cannot go so far as to say that the 
use of nuclear weapons, under positive international law, 
violates the law." At the same time, according to the 
statement, "Given the immense destructive and killing power of 
nuclear weapons, their use cannot be said to be in accord with 
the spirit of humanitarianism that is the basis of international 
law." 
  MOFA was to have submitted the written statement secretly to 
the ICJ, but its contents were revealed by media reports. A 
stream of doubt and criticism then poured forth from Diet and 
cabinet meetings. It was therefore decided to put forth the 
statement after removing the preceding half, i.e. "one cannot 
say that the use of nuclear weapons violates the law." MOFA was 
reportedly reluctant at first to remove part of the statement 
but, taking into account the situation in the Diet on the eve of 
passing the budget as well as the sentiment of the prime 
minister and others, the ministry yielded. 
  Even though MOFA officials took the purely legal 
interpretation that "one cannot say that the use of nuclear 
weapons, under international law, violates the law," one cannot 
deny, as Prime Minister Hata said, that the statement has given 
"the impression to the average person that (the Japanese 
Government) recognizes (the use of nuclear weapons)." Even in 
the absence of a treaty banning the use of nuclear weapons 
themselves, however, humanitarianism and pacifism have appeared 
in the background of various international laws, beginning with 
the UN Charter. MOFA's written statement itself alludes to 
this. Considering this, it is clear that nuclear weapons -- 
which in an instant inflict large-scale and indiscriminate 
casualties on citizens as well as destruction of the earth's 
living creatures, mankind included, and cultural treasures -- 
are contrary to the spirit of international law. 
  Moreover, Japan has experienced the bombing of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, and successive governments have made the non-nuclear 
policy our national policy. Given the feelings of the Japanese 
people, of course, and the government's position, we have the 
obligation to make clear both at home and abroad at every 
opportunity that the use of nuclear weapons violates the spirit 
of an international law based on humanity. We have to say that 
MOFA's recent view is an arbitrary one which, trampling on the 
common sense rooted in the people's many historical experiences, 
is hard to excuse. 
  Since the birth of the coalition government, there has been 
at times a lack of leadership and a growing number of cases in 
which important policies have been determined through 
bureaucratic guidance. With such cases as the plutonium issue 
and North Korea's suspected nuclear program, concerns are 
growing abroad over Japan's possibly acquiring nuclear weapons. 
In light of this, MOFA's action is to be criticized not only 
for lacking in diplomatic sense but for greatly harming the 
national interest.

  [Text] In connection with the fact that about 70 kilograms 
of plutonium remained in residue in processing equipment of a 
plutonium fuel fabrication plant of the Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. (Donen) (located in Tokai, 
Ibaraki Prefecture), the Science and Technology Agency [STA] 
announced on 10 June that it has reached an accord with the IAEA 
on reducing the amount of residue plutonium by 80-85 percent in 
two years through such measures as changing equipment. 
  An STA official in charge, who visited Vienna to attend a 
regular IAEA board of directors meeting, briefed the IAEA on 6 
June -- Vienna time -- on three possible measures to reduce the 
amount of residue plutonium, and he obtained an agreement from 
the IAEA. The three measures are: 1) to tighten control of 
collecting plutonium from processing equipment; 2) to promptly 
take apart the glove boxes [preceding two words in English] for 
producing fuel, which were formerly used at the plant and are 
now in safekeeping, and to collect plutonium from these boxes; 
and 3) to promptly adopt new glove boxes that are difficult for 
residue plutonium to stick to. 
  The residue plutonium issue has come to the fore at the 
"third laboratory for producing plutonium fuel" of the plant, 
which has supplied fuel to fast breeder reactors "Joyo" and 
"Monju" since 1988. Plutonium powder sticks to facilities like 
glass-walled glove boxes, in which workers' gloved-hands handle 
plutonium to shape it into fuel.

  [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries [MAFF] disclosed on 9 June that France and Australia 
have called on Japan to lift its ban on import of their apples. 
It said that the French and the Australian Governments had 
already sent officials in charge of apple export and that the 
Japanese Government has been officially asked to import their 
apples. It also said that a meeting of experts has already been 
held. Following its lifting of the ban last year on import of 
New Zealand apples, the Japanese Government is likely to allow 
import of U.S. apples this autumn. Since France is the largest 
apple exporter in the world, it is expected that competition in 
the apple market in Japan will intensify. 
  According to the MAFF, both France and Australia have 
increased their calls for lifting the ban on the import of their 
apples following the Japanese Government's decision to import 
New Zealand apples last June. However, since their apples are 
affected with harmful insects, Japan, at present, bans import of 
both French and Australian apples for quarantine reasons. 
  However, it will be necessary for Japan to open its market 
to 
France and Australia if their apples are found to be safe for 
export to Japan. As for the U.S. apples, Japan and the United 
States, in their meeting on quarantine issues held in late May 
last year, confirmed that the U.S. pest-control system meets 
Japanese requirements. The first shipment of American apples is 
expected to arrive in Japan immediately after the ban is lifted 
this autumn. 
  The MAFF said that France has already sent data certifying 
extermination of some pests. With this in mind, Japan plans to 
hold meetings of experts to discuss technical quarantine 
problems. 
  France, the largest apple exporter in the world, produced 
2,324,000 tons of apples and exported 547,000 tons in 1992. 
Australia, which produces 312,000 tons, is believed to be eager 
to export its apples because its yearly export is only 31,000 
tons.

  [Text] MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a survey on the next 
general election through its nationwide communication network on 
10 June. It asked members of the House of Representatives their 
prediction on the schedule of the next general election and 
under which electoral system -- the present multiple-seat 
constituency system or the new system combining single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation -- they are 
preparing for the election. Results of the survey show that 
only a few respondents have ordered their local offices to 
prepare for full-fledged election campaigns, assuming that there 
will be "an election in the near future." Such a result shows 
that both ruling and opposition party members have judged that 
there is little possibility of a dissolution of the lower house 
to conduct a general election after the passage of a motion of 
no- confidence against the Hata Cabinet at the end of the 
current Diet session. However, most Diet members who have 
started preparations have been doing so for the multiple-seat 
constituency system in order to be ready for early dissolution. 
This result illuminates the Diet members' anxieties. 
  Lower house members or their staff in charge of local 
offices 
were surveyed from 1 to 7 June. Among questions asked in this 
survey are: 1) have you put up posters or reserved halls to 
hold rallies with a possible election in mind? 2) details of 
orders given by Diet members to their offices; 3) under which 
electoral system are you preparing, multiple-seat constituency, 
or single seat constituency systems? 4) likely schedule of the 
election; 5) in case of an election, under which electoral 
system will the election be conducted? 
  With regard to the schedule of the election, one Diet member 
(Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], from the third district of 
Hokkaido) indicated his prediction that the election will be 
conducted "in July under the multiple-seat constituency system." 
However, an overwhelming majority of office staff said that they 
have not been "informed by Diet members that an election will be 
conducted in near future," (according to the office of a Japan 
New Party member from the 11th district of Tokyo). Since the 
possibility that the LDP will cooperate with the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan in submitting a no-confidence motion 
is diminishing, the prevailing view among Diet members 
throughout Japan is that "the prospect of dissolution has become 
remote." Thus, the level of tension in relation to a possible 
election appears to have subsided in comparison to a recent 
period. 
  Concerning preparations for the election, a majority said 
they have been preparing for the "multiple-seat constituency" or 
both "single and multiple-seat constituency systems." It seems 
that the respondents have no other choice but to give priority 
to preparing for election under the multiple-seat constituency 
system because they must be ready for a possible Diet 
dissolution, and also because redistricting of single-seat 
constituencies has not been completed.

  [Text] Ruling parties have begun to informally sound out 
the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] about its 
return to the ruling coalition after all Hata cabinet members, 
with the exception of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, resign en 
masse to pave the way for the formation of a new coalition 
government. This was disclosed by several senior members of the 
ruling parties and the SDPJ on 10 June. The ruling parties 
intend to make the SDPJ come back to the ruling coalition by 
moving closer to a voluntary general resignation by the Hata 
cabinet, which has been sought by the SDPJ. Rightists in the 
SDPJ, who have a close relationship with Secretary General 
Wataru Kubo, and trade unions are speaking highly of moves by 
the ruling parties to bring the SDPJ back to the ruling 
coalition. They are calling on the SDPJ to return to the 
coalition government after seeking an agreement on policies. 
However, Chairman Murayama, centrists, and leftists of the SDPJ 
are poised to press the Hata cabinet to resign en masse. 
Whether or not the SDPJ will decide to return to the ruling 
coalition remains unknown. 
  During a recent Central Committee meeting, the SDPJ called 
for a voluntary general resignation by the Hata cabinet and the 
formation of a new coalition government. During the meeting, 
the SDPJ also announced that it would not hesitate to submit a 
no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet and 
call for dissolving the House of Representatives and holding 
general elections. 
  On 10 June, the ruling parties told a senior rightist member 
of the SDPJ that it would be difficult for the Hata cabinet to 
voluntarily resign en masse because Prime Minister Hata has had 
no political flaws. But they informally asked the SDPJ to 
accept a sweeping reshuffle of the Hata cabinet as a general 
resignation and to then return to the ruling coalition. This 
request has been endorsed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, and Komeito [Clean Government 
Party] Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. 
  Commenting on the request by the ruling parties in a 10 June 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Takashi Yonezawa, ruling Democratic 
Socialist Party chairman, said: "A sweeping reshuffle of the 
Hata cabinet is one of our options." An influential senior 
member in a ruling party said: "There will be a sweeping 
reshuffle of the Hata cabinet or it will resign en masse if the 
Diet approves a no- confidence motion. If the Diet votes down 
the no-confidence motion, the Hata cabinet will talk with the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the SDPJ about how to replace 
the current coalition partners." However, he indicated that for 
the time being, the ruling parties would aim to bring the SDPJ 
back into the ruling coalition through a sweeping reshuffle of 
the Hata cabinet. 
  In response, a senior rightist member of the SDPJ has 
insisted the: "SDPJ hold talks with the ruling parties to look 
for areas of compromise in a bid to return to the ruling 
coalition rather than merely asking the Hata cabinet to 
voluntarily resign en masse." Expressing his intention to 
respond positively to the ruling parties request, he indicated 
the possibility of Kubo and Ozawa holding talks. 
  On 10 June, in a separate YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Kubo, 
while indicating his eagerness for the SDPJ to return to the 
ruling coalition, stated: "At the present stage, if our party 
accepts the request from the ruling parties, it would become a 
hurdle to new developments." However, Chairman Murayama stated: 
"If the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse, we can do 
nothing with the ruling parties. We cannot accept the idea that 
the SDPJ will return to the ruling coalition after the Hata 
cabinet undergoes a sweeping reshuffle." 
  If the idea is surfacing within the SDPJ that the party will 
rejoin the ruling coalition after the Hata cabinet undergoes a 
sweeping reshuffle, this will inevitably spark an intra-party 
confrontation. Consultations between the SDPJ and the ruling 
parties on forming a new coalition government are expected to 
face rough sailing because of the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development. There is a strong view 
that it will be difficult for the SDPJ to return to the ruling 
coalition. The ruling parties intend to look for a way to forge 
an alliance with the LDP, while urging the SDPJ to return to the 
ruling coalition. 
  In the 10 June YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview, Kubo proposed that 
if a new coalition government is formed, a "general council" be 
created as the ruling parties' supreme decision-making body to 
replace the current meeting of representatives, and that the 
body be composed of plural representatives sent by ruling 
parties and parliamentary groups in proportion to their 
parliamentary seats. Kubo's proposal is one of the conditions 
for the SDPJ to participate in a new coalition government, and 
the proposal is aimed at getting rid of the traditional 
back-door negotiations by running the new coalition government 
democratically and making its decision-making process more 
transparent.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is taking a different 
position from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa on the so-called "conservative-conservative 
coalition" with some Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] members. 
While Ozawa is very keen about allying with LDP members, Hata 
wants to continue to search for a way to persuade the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan to rejoin the coalition in order to 
secure the present administration's hold on power. 
  The prime minister strongly denied the possibility of a 
"conservative-conservative coalition" at the House of 
Councillors' Budget Committee on 13 June. He said, "The LDP 
exists as a bona fide political force. My honest feeling is 
that I want to rebuild a framework under which this political 
force and the new forces can confront each other in a debate on 
the future of this country." 
  A top government official also stressed on the evening of 13 
June that, "The prime minister's remarks meant that he still 
wants to return to the starting point of the coalition," thus 
indicating that Ozawa's statement was not coordinated with the 
Prime Minister's Office. 
  The reason behind Hata's negative view of the "conservative- 
conservative coalition" is his belief that switching from using 
political reform as the sole yardstick to classify politicians 
as "reformists" or "conservatives" to using basic policies on 
Japan-U.S. security pact, tax reform, and others to change the 
direction of political realignment is "merely a number trick 
aimed at gaining political power," (according to his close 
aides). 
  Furthermore, the prime minister undoubtedly perceives the 
"conservative-conservative coalition" scheme as the other side 
of the coin to "attempts to topple Hata." On the one hand, Hata 
shows his dispassionate attitude that "I did not become prime 
minister because I wanted to;" on the other, he seems to wish to 
personally give direction to policy issues such as 
administrative reform and deregulation, and to efforts to assess 
Japan's postwar history on the occasion of the 50th anniversary 
of the end of World War II next year. 
  It remains uncertain whether Hata and Ozawa, who have 
maintained a relationship of alliance so far, will be able to 
preserve their unity over the "conservative-conservative 
coalition" scheme. The "Hata-Ozawa relationship" is now facing 
a delicate turning point.

<F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman-elect of the </F>
Democratic Socialist Party, by an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have called for inter 
party talks on election ties-up as early as next weekend under 
the coalition's joint floor group "Kaishin." Could you explain 
your true intention? 
  [Yonezawa] To beat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] under 
the single-seat constituency elections, the coalition must be 
united. I think the LDP is becoming well-prepared for general 
elections compared with coalition parties. However, it is still 
uncertain whether or not the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] ties up with us. SDPJ members would react strongly if we 
start preparing for election without them, but they may not take 
any action if we keep waiting. We are in a dilemma. 
  After the Hata administration became a minority government, 
the opposition began to seek a dissolution of the lower house 
through a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. Under such 
circumstances, the election may be held earlier than expected. 
When we discuss election strategies, we have to consider 
whether coalition parties should promote joint election 
campaigns within the existing framework, or form a new party. 
The coalition must have uniform policies even under joint 
campaign to back multiparty candidates, or voters would say the 
joint campaign is nothing more than a marriage of convenience 
for election only. Hereafter, coalition parties will have more 
opportunities to coordinate their policies, and I guess policy 
debates for election ties-up may become the key to the next 
stage of political realignment. In that case, political 
realignment would be accelerated by policy debates. I think 
members of the "Kaishin" can start policy talks anytime. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP] are expected to open policy talks at the initiative 
by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo].... 
  [Yonezawa] We are wondering if the SDPJ can return to the 
coalition, if we can tie up with each other in election 
campaigns, and if we can jointly seek political realignment. 
Since the present situation is very delicate, it is good to 
have frank talks between the two parties. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As the condition for its return to 
the coalition, the SDPJ is calling for a mass resignation of the 
Hata administration. Does the coalition intend to compromise 
with the SDPJ if it asks for a "full reshuffle of the cabinet"? 
  [Yonezawa] If the prime minister says he "voluntarily 
dissolves the cabinet," he would immediately lose his 
leadership. From a common sense standpoint, he cannot make such 
a pledge right now because it would damage political power 
balance. There may be various possibilities of the "full 
reshuffle," but that should be discussed to strengthen the 
coalition. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The coalition's tax reform 
negotiations are entering the final stage. Do you think the 
coalition should indicate to what degree the consumption tax 
should be increased? 
  [Yonezawa] I think the coalition must clearly indicate the 
rate of tax hike. However, the timing, the scale, and 
methodology of tax reform ultimately depend on results of 
consultations with the LDP, SDPJ, and the Sakigake. When 
certain accords are obtained, those must be clearly written in 
our proposal. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you evaluate Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? 
  [Yonezawa] I agree with their opinions but this does not 
mean I agree with anything they say. The DSP supports their 
ideas according to its own judgment. So, I do not understand 
why some people say "the DSP flatters the Shinseito and the 
Komeito." I think they are both capable men. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you resolved to become the last 
leader of the DSP? 
  [Yonezawa] When the new party is formed, all participating 
parties should take off old clothes. In this sense, everybody 
else will share the fate with the DSP chairman. I want to 
complete the new party during my term as the DSP chairman.

<F P=106> [Article by Senshu University professor, Kimihiro Masamura: </F>
"Create `Fair Society' Through Economic Reform: Do Comprehensive 
Reform of Tax System; Changing Tax Burden Requires Public's 
Trust"] 
  [Text] 1. Economic reform" is the next priority task, even 
for the purpose of completing "political reform," so, regardless 
of how the framework of the coalition government may change, the 
new cabinet has the responsibility to place before the Japanese 
people the prospect of building a society which has a sense of 
security and a sense of fairness. 
  2. Reform of the tax system is essential, but it is a 
question that should be be raised as one part of a package of 
economic and social policies aimed at creating administrative 
reform and a welfare society. 
  3. What is required now will be self-evident if we fix our 
eyes on the future and study in a thorough and concrete manner, 
and the foundation of unified policy for the coalition 
government will also be found in this. 
<H5>  Success or Failure of "the Economy" Is the Very Thing That </H5>
Will Influence Evaluation 
  The Hosokawa cabinet was short-lived, but it accomplished an 
important advance by "political reform." We have finally begun 
to discern the end of "postwar politics." But, bearing the 
legacy of "postwar politics" on their backs, politicians are 
running about in confusion, and the Japanese people still do not 
know what meaning politics can have for them, or what it would 
be best to demand of politics. The new government also had a 
troubled beginning. 
  There is no need to reject "postwar politics" in its 
entirety, but we cannot respond to the demands of the times by a 
posture which merely clings to the slogans of the past as though 
they were "magic charms." If one says "protect the 
Constitution," one has a responsibility to show in detail what 
kind of policies will be effective for the purpose of giving 
life today to those principles of pacifism (independent 
participation in international peace), liberal democracy 
(protection of human rights and freedom), and social democracy 
(guarantee of the social rights which form the foundation of a 
welfare society) which are incorporated in the Constitution. 
Political parties of which the form in which they would like to 
make the Japanese nation and society in the future is not 
visible have no reason to exist. 
  The end of Japan's "postwar politics" is linked deeply with 
the "end of the postwar period" in terms of world history, which 
is shown by the conclusion of the cold war and the decline of 
American leadership. Japan is an economic superpower which 
accounts for 15 percent of world GNP. Japanese must bear a 
commensurate responsibility for preservation of the earth and 
the survival of mankind. That is essential, not for the sake of 
the people of other nations, but for the sake of Japanese 
themselves. 
  Japan, which became the final nation to succeed at 20th 
century industrial civilization, must shoulder a leading role in 
grappling with a task in terms of human history, the conquest of 
20th century industrial civilization. 
  There is a strong possibility that, in contrast to Japan's 
international responsibilities growing ever heavier, the 
vitality of Japan's economy and society will, rather, go on 
declining rapidly. Japan is approaching a time of great change. 
The number of children is declining, and aging is progressing 
more than previous estimates. The working age population (15-64 
years of age) will soon begin to decline, and because of 
problems in education, there is also concern about the "quality" 
of the human resources that will be provided. Japan is 
confronting "a crisis in the possibility of the continuation of 
society itself." 
  First of all, "political reform" is not a goal in itself. 
The 
goal is to prepare conditions for political structure and 
political entities by which it will be possible to form 
agreement on policies to deal with important tasks at home and 
abroad. It is natural that the Hosokawa cabinet raised 
"economic reform" as the next task following "political 
reform," and preached the necessity for administrative reform, 
deregulation, decentralization of authority, and so on. We 
must bring to an end, not only "postwar politics," but the 
"postwar economy" as well. 
  Transforming the "postwar" administrative system, which was 
formed by carrying on the legacies of the promotion of industry 
and increased production since the Meiji era and of wartime 
control, is an important key to "economic reform." Unless the 
prospect is shown of creating, through "economic reform," a 
society with a sense of security and a sense of fairness, the 
public's interest in politics will not increase, and dialogue 
between politicians and the public concerning policy will not 
develop. "Economic reform" is also essential for "political 
reform." 
  For politicians to abandon their efforts toward "economic 
reform," and engross themselves in the changing alliances among 
political parties can only be described as a self-destructive 
act. I would like them to recognize that the success or failure 
of "economic reform" is the very thing that will be the greatest 
factor in determining voters' evaluation of the politicians of 
the coalition governing parties. 
  There is great significance in the fact that the Liberal 
Democratic Party lost control of the government, and that the 
structural obstacle of politicians and bureaucrats joining 
together to prevent reform was removed. The significance of the 
"Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] versus non-LDP" setup will 
disappear if self-destruction of the LDP advances, but for the 
present it is better not to allow the LDP to return to power. 
The LDP should probably elaborate its policy plan for returning 
to power after it has seriously examined the ideological and 
structural defects of its past reign. 
<H5>  First, Put Japan on the Track of Stable Growth </H5>
  Administrative reform and tax reform are also not ends in 
themselves. One cannot be certain what form administration, 
government finance, and the tax system will have unless one 
makes clear what the government will do for the sake of the 
future. In the period of LDP rule, the "backward-looking 
elimination" called "reducing the budget deficit" and "doing 
things in such a way that government does not become too big" 
was dominant. The LDP lacked a doctrine of a welfare society, 
and even had a tendency to criticize Keynesianism and the 
welfare state, so its conservative policy ideas were too strong. 
  When the Hosokawa cabinet took office a "future-oriented, 
goal-oriented" debate was finally seen even on administrative 
reform. It is important that conciousness has become stronger 
of wishing to create a system in which one can do on a priority 
basis things which the government should do in order to improve 
the "quality" of life, build a foundation for social stability, 
and strengthen security for old age. 
  At the same time that we simplify administration by 
eliminating "guidance" and "regulation," and promote 
decentralization of authority, we must strengthen such social 
rules as fair trade, environmental preservation, and labor 
standards, and the function of such things as urban planning. 
What should probably be demanded of the central government and 
of local governments is that they abandon the senseless 
scattering of money and adopt positive initiatives to establish 
reliable social welfare programs and promote regional welfare. 
  Before inauguration of the new cabinet, the parties which 
make up the coalition government tried to identify the items of 
their agreement on basic domestic and foreign policies. 
Governments exist precisely for the purpose of executing a 
series of policies, so when new problems are raised or there is 
a change in prime ministers, it is natural that the government 
try to strengthen the coalition's foundation by identifying 
anew the items of policy agreement. Increasing the 
opportunities for dialogue on policy is also an important way of 
putting an end to "postwar politics." 
  Regardless of how the framework of the coalition may change, 
the basic tasks of the government will not change. Many people 
point out the ideological disunity of the parties that make up 
the coalition government, and predict that conflicts will 
surface every time they discuss policies in a concrete manner, 
but the tasks that Japan is confronting are important, so what 
the government must do will reveal itself if the government 
fixes its eyes on the future and studies in a concrete manner 
what it must do now. 
  The reason why conflict among the governing parties looks 
serious is that many political parties and politicians are 
prolonging the "postwar politics" in which ideology continued to 
exert a great influence. Discussion of policy will not deepen 
the conflict among the coalition governing parties; one should 
probably say that rejection of policy discussion will expand the 
conflict. 
  I hope that efforts will be made to demand thorough debate 
on 
policy, both among the governing parties of the coalition and 
between governing and opposition parties, without fearing 
policy debate. I think this is also one of the Hosokawa 
cabinet's important lessons of August. It should probably be 
said that it cannot be helped if, in the course of such debate, 
there emerge political organizations or politicians who are left 
behind by the times and abandoned by the public. 
  I have previously written in this column (dated 5 January) 
on 
the basic tasks of economic policy, so I will not repeat much of 
it, but, first of all, it is necessary to realize stable growth 
for the Japanese economy. We are now in a period of transition 
from "moderate growth" to "low growth," and even growth on the 
level of 3 percent will not be difficult if adjustment of 
corporate and household resources progresses. For that reason 
also, it is necessary to increase the reliability of Japan's 
economic system and the government's medium and long-term 
economic policies. 
  Second, such things are needed as priority allocation of 
resources for the purpose of dealing with extreme aging by 
strengthening such social welfare as custodial care and 
nurturing, improving the housing and living environment and 
building a foundation for future expansion. Administrative 
reform which includes decentralization of authority and 
relaxation of regulations will be an essential precondition. 
Third, it is necessary to make clear the revenue source support 
for those positive measures. 
<H5>  Organize a Working Committee To Restudy the Tax System </H5>
  Reform of the tax system is an unavoidable task, whoever may 
be in charge of the government. Government finance is in a 
structural crisis, and it is clear clear that there a limit to 
depending on direct taxation. An increase in the rate of the 
consumption tax is essential, even as a measure to provide 
funding for reductions in such things as income tax and 
residential tax which have already been decided on. But it will 
probably be necessary to give consideration to the following 
points in regard to reform of the tax system. 
  First, is the fact that it is necessary, to not treat tax 
reform independently, but present it as one link in a 
comprehensive "economic reform" program as a policy package. 
Unless a start on administrative reform and reform of 
government finance is shown, efforts toward a welfare society 
are made concrete, and the prospect of a life in which a sense 
of security and sense of fairness are guaranteed becomes clear, 
many Japanese will not be able to understand the necessity for 
reform of the tax system. And it would also result in the 
scoring of points by irresponsible political parties which 
pander to the public by calling only for opposition to raising 
taxes. 
  Public pledges which do not show the backing of necessary 
sources of revenue are no more than irresponsible political 
propaganda; in order to change the public's tax burden, there 
must be public confidence in the effectiveness and fairness of 
the government's policies as a whole. For a government to 
propose only a change in the public's tax burden, without 
indicating in detail what the government will do for the people, 
would be a foolish policy. It would be impossible to gain 
agreement for something on the level of tacking on a vision of 
welfare, without showing the prospect of reforming 
administration and government finance as a whole. 
  The use to which the tax increase will be put is not the 
only 
thing that will be asked, it will be asked whether 
administration and government finance as a whole will be made 
over into something effective. The government will probably 
have to show the public its determination to use administration 
and government finance as a whole in a priority manner to 
enhance national welfare, rather than clinging to patchwork 
methods like "taxes for specific objectives." 
  The second is the fact that an overall restudy of the tax 
system itself is needed. Japan's current tax system has become 
much too complicated because of the piling up of "stopgap 
measures" since the Shoup recommendations, so transparency has 
been lost, and fairness has been impaired. In addition to the 
present pressing task of tax reform, within the year, which 
includes measures to fund tax reductions which have already been 
put into effect, it is probably necessary to set a definite 
deadline and organize a working group for the purpose of a 
sweeping restudy of the tax system. 
  In order that the working group not become a body for 
adjusting competing interests, it will be made up of only a 
small number of experts who can be trusted; it is necessary to 
commission theoretical and technical study under the terms that 
it comprehensively cover national and local taxes, taxes and 
social insurance premiums, and benefits and enforcement.

  [Text] On 6 June, expert members of the working group on 
"Import Promotion, Market Access Improvement, and Distribution" 
of the government's Administrative Reform Promotion 
Council(headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata), presented a 
report recommending abolition or alleviation of Japan's unique 
regulations as well as drastic reduction of gaps in commodity 
prices between Japan and other countries to the cabinet minister 
in charge of the group. 
  This means all three working groups under the council have 
presented their reports. On deregulation of some individual 
regulations, however, this last report presented dual 
alternatives, leaving the government to make decisions on what 
alternatives to choose. 
  The report was prepared by compiling the views of seven 
expert members representing academic and economic circles, and 
it recommends, among others: 1) Abolishing or easing Japan's 
unique economic regulations; 2) adopting as a target the 
reduction of gaps in commodity prices between Japan and other 
countries by half; 3) abolishing or easing rules which impede 
business operations; and 4) establishing without delay an 
administrative reform committee without any present or former 
bureaucrats represented on it.

  [Text] The personnel appointment regarding the post of 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT] president, which 
developed into a dispute among political circles because of the 
Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's [PTM] attempt to promote 
Shigeo Sawada, NTT vice president and former administrative vice 
minister, to the position, reached a conclusion after NTT 
President Hitoshi Kojima chose to remain in his current post. 
  On the surface, the PTM is generally viewed as having 
yielded 
to the "criticism of bureaucrats' practice of amakudari" [a 
practice known as 'descent from heaven' in which former senior 
bureaucrats receive high-paying jobs in the private sector or in 
public corporations]. However, the PTM is not that weak-kneed. 
  Strengthening their grip on NTT is an absolutely necessary 
card for PTM officials to "promote competition in the domestic 
telecommunications market," which is an important issue. That 
they will compromise before the public's criticism of 
bureaucrats is unthinkable. It should be considered that their 
judgment was calculated in relation to the resumption of 
Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
  In the "government procurement" sector, which is one of the 
three priority areas of the talks, Japan and the United States 
are sharply at odds over whether to include NTT's procurement of 
materials as a negotiations topic, along with government 
procurement. The U.S. side demands: "NTT is a semi-government 
agency whose stocks are held by the government, and the Japanese 
Government should promise [to open] NTT's procurement of 
materials [to foreign suppliers]." The fact that NTT's 
procurement, which amounts to more than 1 trillion yen a year, 
is far more profitable than government procurement, is too 
obvious for the United States to overlook. 
  In response, Japan has been refuting the U.S. side saying: 
"NTT is a company that has already been privatized. If the 
government guides its procurement, it will be a managed trade." 
  Having said that, if a former PTM official were appointed to 
the post of NTT president, the Japanese Government might end up 
adding fuel to U.S. criticism that "the government and NTT are 
one." That is why the PTM posed as making a concession this 
time. 
  Of course, the PTM has not given up its "NTT President 
Sawada" plan. This can be inferred from the fact that the PTM 
blocked a move toward shelving Sawada to the post of chairman 
with all its strength. 
  There is strong indication that PTM maneuvering, including 
personnel appointments, will become active again, once the 
negotiations between Japan and the United States are concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; part four of series entitled </F>
"Bureaucrats and the Coalition Government": "Bureaucrats Resist 
Drastic Reform of Food Control System"] 
  [Text] "The contents of this thing have changed completely, 
and we have so wanted to change the food control system 
drastically." These were the words uttered by Diet member 
Muneaki Samejima of the Japan New Party [JNP] as he read a copy 
of the policy agreement of the coalition government. 
Priority Given to Maintaining the System [subhead] 
  At a policy discussion meeting of the coalition parties in 
mid- April when the Hata government was about to set sail, a 
behind-the- scenes battle was fought over the question of 
reforming the food control system. A "rough draft" prepared on 
16 April had included the position of the JNP "supporting the 
reform of the agricultural cooperatives -- by adopting the 
market economy in production, distribution, and sales (passage 
omitted) -- in order to improve self-sufficiency in foodstuffs." 
The draft had included the intention to abolish the existing 
rigid Food Control Law and to legislate a new law designed to 
help strengthen the competitiveness of Japan's agriculture in 
preparation for the tariffication of rice in the future. 
  But on the morning of 18 April, Norihiko Narita, secretary 
to 
Prime Minister Hosokawa, appeared at the office of the JNP and 
delivered a hand-written, three-page-long revised draft. He 
then said that "an overall revision, including the part on 
agriculture, is necessary." When he was asked who wrote it, the 
secretary avoiding giving a clear-cut answer. Thus, eventually, 
a portion of the agreement was revised to read "to utilize the 
function of the market economy in the areas of production, 
distribution, and sales (passage omitted) while maintaining the 
self-sufficiency system for basic foodstuffs." This meant a 
change back to the maintenance of the food control system and 
the taking of the substance out of the introduction of the 
market economy principle. 
  When asked whether the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
and 
Fisheries [MAFF] intervened with the prime minister's office, a 
ranking official of the ministry denied this, saying "I have not 
heard anything about that happening." Still, however, he looked 
happy with the contents of the agreement and remarked, "Now that 
I have seen the expressions used to explain the details, it 
seems to me that someone who is familiar with agricultural 
administration was involved." 
  The MAFF started discussing a reform of the food control 
system in the beginning of the year following a decision late 
last year to partially open the rice market. The public 
outpouring of distrust in the system as a result of the 
controversy over rice shortages also prompted the ministry to 
act. But the ministry's thinking was based on the premise that 
the reform should be effected within the existing system, and 
such drastic measures as reorganizing or abolishing the Food 
Agency were never contemplated. 
Meticulous Groundwork Done on Ruling Parties in Advance 
[subhead] 
  Even in the full-scale ruling-opposition parties' 
negotiations since the end of May -- with an eye on the 
formulation in July of an intermediate report by the 
Agricultural Administration Council on the food control system 
reform -- the MAFF took the position of wanting to seek the 
understanding of the public on the condition that "it will be a 
reform within the existing system," and even MAFF Minister 
Mutsuki Kato took the position of respecting the bureaucrats' 
position, saying "The basic part of the food control system will 
be maintained." The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which until 
last year had run the agricultural administration in close 
concert with the MAFF, was also all for this, with former MAFF 
Minister Tomio Yamamoto declaring, "Saying that the food control 
system is unnecessary is sheer absurdity." 
  The MAFF is concerned that it does not have good personal 
connections with the coalition parties because there are so few 
Diet members in the parties who previously had worked in the 
ministry. As such, it recently has been sending out almost every 
day its officials to offices of Komeito [Clean Government Party] 
and Democratic Socialist Party Diet members in the Diet members 
hall, in efforts to gain friends for it. MAFF Vice Minister 
Toshihiko Tsuruhiko complained, "Since the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan bolted the coalition, this is taking much more 
time than it did before." But even a staff official of the 
Ministry of Finance said in praise, "We are awed by their 
ability to use politicians who are just good for their 
purposes." While the winds for the dissolution of the Diet for 
a general election may be blowing, the vote- collecting machines 
of agricultural areas, such as agricultural cooperatives and 
land-improvement districts, are as sound as ever. An officer of 
the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperative Associations noted 
his union's efforts to approach the ruling coalition parties, 
saying, "In the next election, we must think about dividing 
votes between the LDP and the ruling coalition parties." 
<H5>  "We Are the Ones Who Draw the Picture" </H5>
  The MAFF is standing firm against even the voices of the 
private sector which are demanding reform. The Administrative 
Reform Promotion Headquarters in April asked for an easing of 
existing rules against grain dealers newly participating in the 
market, but the ministry rejected this, declaring, "That is a 
matter that should be taken up by the Agricultural 
Administration Council." The ministry is confident it can 
control the Agricultural Administration Council because it 
believes, "There can be all kinds of discussions, but in the 
end, we will be the people who draw the picture." 
  Within the MAFF, there are some who even strongly resist 
considering a reform of the food control system within the 
framework of the existing system. As for operations on 
reforming the system, the minister's Secretariat is pushing for 
a "system of voluntary reductions of farming acreage" which will 
enable farmers to choose whether or not to reduce farming 
acreage, but many officials of the ministry's Agricultural 
Production Bureau are going around speaking negatively of it and 
saying, "That is impossible." Even the Food Agency, which wants 
to protect the existing interests of wholesale and retail 
stores, is not so willing to support the deregulation of 
distribution. 
  The bureaucrats may have heard criticism (made by Kozo 
Uchida, a member of the Rice Prime Review Council and the 
executive director of the Federation of Economic Organizations 
of Japan) saying, "The postwar bureaucrats of the MAFF were 
fired up with the ideal of rebuilding the nation's agriculture. 
We don't sense any passions from them now." The bureaucrats 
want to be deaf to the song of "reform" and to look the other 
way.

  [Text] Toyota, Nissan, and other automobile manufacturers 
have begun requesting that Nippon Steel and other major steel 
companies develop low-cost surface-treated sheet steel. 
Surface-treated sheet steel is one of the highest grades of 
sheet steel used in the exterior sheets of automobiles. With 
demand shifting to low-cost automobiles and the revived 
competitiveness of the American Big Three and other car 
companies, however, Japan's automakers are revising their 
high-class orientation even in sheet steel in a combined effort 
to lower prices. Nippon Steel and other steel companies, 
although responding by developing new sheet steel, are asking 
the automakers to put off adopting it for as long as possible. 
  Exterior sheets in automobiles are surface-treated steel 
sheets whose surfaces are galvanized to rustproof them. The 
galvanization process is different at Toyota, Nissan, and each 
of the other carmakers. Toyota uses a two-layer galvanization 
process, with a layer of electroplating added to top-quality 
hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel. Toyota has been probing to 
see if the steelmakers can make some of the two-layer galvanized 
sheet steel a single layer. The company is planning to adopt the 
low-cost sheet steel in five to six years. 
  Nissan uses an electrogalvanizing process. Aiming to enhance 
the beautiful appearance of the painted exterior sheets, 
steelmakers have been placing slight irregularities on the 
surface. For that reason, the yield rate for the sheet steel is 
said to suffer. Nissan has begun to request of the steelmakers a 
high-productivity, low-cost way to produce steel sheet, even if 
there is some deterioration in external appearance. 
  The rustproofing of today's sheet steel is said to last over 
10 years. During the bubble economy period, the automakers all 
aimed for high-quality sheet steel; the steel companies 
established new production lines to meet the demand. However, 
with the fall in domestic automobile production, the operating 
rate for the surface- treated sheet steel galvanizing equipment 
has been stagnating. Nippon Steel has been postponing putting 
into operation its newest galvanizing facilities, built at the 
cost of 25 billion yen at its Nagoya steelworks. 
  The steel companies are saying, "We will cooperate with your 
requests to develop low-cost surface-treated sheet steel to 
lower manufacturing costs. But we would like you to wait in 
adopting the new sheet steel until the depreciation on the 
present facilities is over." However, the steel companies could 
lose their foremost industrial customers if they do not 
cooperate with Japan's carmakers in reducing costs. The steel 
companies will apparently have to quicken their responses by 
restructuring.

<F P=106> [Report by Teresa Poole: "Kim IL-song Spells out Terms for </F>
Nuclear Peace"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- President Kim Il-song of North Korea is 
prepared to freeze his country's nuclear programme in return for 
US diplomatic recognition and other concessions, according to an 
American scholar who met him for three hours last Thursday. 
  Selig Harrison, an Asian affairs specialist, said in Beijing 
yesterday that Mr Kim wanted the US and other countries to 
guarantee that they would supply North Korea with a light water 
reactor if Pyongyang suspends what is widely viewed as an 
attempt to develop nuclear weapons. Mr Kim disclosed his terms 
as the US and South Korea prepared to impose sanctions on North 
Korea for not allowing international inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  North Korea, which says it will view sanctions as an act of 
war, threatened South Korea last week with devastation and 
warned that Japan would face "deserving punishment" if it joined 
an embargo. The crisis impelled President Bill Clinton to devote 
four hours of meetings at the White House on Friday to the 
sanctions question. 
  Mr Harrison, who met Mr Kim, 82, at a residence outside 
Pyongyang, described the dictator as an alert man who did not 
seem bent on nuclear confrontation. "I found him very sharp, 
very alert. We talked for two hours and he was absolutely 
forceful, and alert, and quick and sharp. After the two hours, 
at lunch, he was a little -- like anyone at 82 -- slower, and he 
wasn't talking as much. But he's walking well and seems fine." 
  He described Mr Kim's parting words: "He chainsmokes, and he 
shook his cigarette at me and threw down his matches, and said: 
'The point is we (the US and North Korea) must be on good terms 
with each other, and then we will both know everything about 
each other. And we mustn't put preconditions. How can you 
expect (us) to let a country with which we are still at war know 
everything about our country?" 
  Mr Harrison said North Korea would not build nuclear weapons 
if the US gave it diplomatic recognition and lifted the economic 
embargo in place since the 1950-53 war. North Korea also wants 
a US guarantee not to use nuclear weapons first on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] members should speed up 
the reduction of taxes to below 5 percent on products that have 
potential to attract foreign investment in the region, according 
to Suwan Phasuksawat, deputy director-general of the Fiscal 
Policy Office. 
  While AFTA participants have agreed to reduce taxes on many 
products to between zero and 5 percent within periods ranging 
from eight to 15 years, the reductions should be expedited in 
some cases, he said. 
  Mr Suwan headed the Thai delegation at the ASEAN senior 
officials' meeting in Indonesia on June 3 and 4. Besides 
discussing tariff cuts, participants also reviewed measures that 
are considered non-tariff barriers under the framework of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Under the AFTA framework, non-tariff barriers will have to 
be 
scrapped within the next five years.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Susiri warned Burmese 
students yesterday not to protest in an effort to bar Rangoon's 
representatives from attending a foreign ministers' meeting of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  Burma will attend the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Bangkok 
in 
July for the first time as the guest of the host country, 
Thailand. Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said dissident 
Burmese students should refrain from conducting political 
activities affecting Thailand's relations with Burma. 
  "The Burmese students who live at the (Burmese Students) 
centre should know how to behave. 
  "It is not appropriate for them to conduct any activities 
jeopardising relations between Thailand and neighbouring 
countries while living here," the minister said, apparently 
referring to Burma. 
  The Interior Ministry is attempting to block protests which 
might take place during the meeting. 
  Interior officials are keeping a watch on Burmese dissidents 
and ethnic minority groups including students at the centre at 
Ban Maniloi in Rat Buri Province as the ministry has been told 
about a plan to prevent Rangoon officials from attending the 
meeting.

  [Text] Thailand and Cambodia intend to speed up the 
establishment of the Mekong Committee after it has laid dormant 
for nearly two decades because of political instability in 
Cambodia, according to the Foreign Ministry. 
  A statement released following a 45-minute meeting between 
visiting Cambodian Minister of Public Works and Transport Ing 
Kiet and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday morning said 
Thailand and Cambodia agreed to the importance and benefits of 
the early establishment of the Mekong Committee. 
  Both countries are also open to other Mekong countries -- 
China, which is the source of the Mekong River, and Burma 
joining the Mekong Committee after it is set up officially. 
  Cambodia officially rejoined the three other riparian 
countries Thailand, Vietnam and Laos in their efforts to work 
out common grounds for the use of the river in February 1993. 
  The four countries said a common framework would be 
completed 
within a year with each country setting up a working group to 
draft the framework with the United Nations Development 
Programme serving as coordinator. 
  Sources said an agreement had still not been reached on the 
sensitive issue of the use of the water in the Mekong River. 
Ing Kiet, the chairman of Cambodia's Mekong Committee, said 
after meeting Science, Technology and Environment Minister 
Phisan Munlasatsathon on Friday that Cambodia was open to other 
countries joining the committee after a framework on the use of 
the Mekong is completed. 
  "As soon as our authority finds a solution acceptable to all 
four governments, why not expand the committee to outside 
countries. We are open to that," he said. 
  Ing Kieth is on a five-day official visit to Bangkok, Nong 
Khai and Maha Sarakham as guest of the Science, Technology and 
Environment Ministry. 
  He is scheduled to leave Bangkok today. 
  Bilateral cooperation and the current political situation in 
Cambodia were also raised during the meeting with Sqn Ldr 
[Squadron Leader] Prasong. 
  The two ministers expressed the hope that tomorrow's talks 
between government and Khmer Rouge representatives in Phnom Penh 
would be successful. 
  Both agree the development of Cambodia and support for the 
prosperity ot the Cambodian people are important to bringing 
about peace and prosperity in the region as a whole. 
  Thailand could cooperate with its neighbour in the area of 
infrastructure development and energy.

  [Excerpt] According to a source in the foreign job 
placement field, Libya has instructed Libyan employers to send 
Thai workers home in three months. Earlier this year Libya 
announced that it would not hire any Thai workers. Libyan 
employers have begun to hire many workers from China and Vietnam 
to replace outgoing Thai workers. 
  Piti Chuchunmanakit, manager of the Siri and Son Job 
Placement Company, which places Thai workers in Libyan jobs, 
said Libya has implemented a new policy which bars completely 
the hiring of Thai workers. Cooperation has been sought from 
employers to gradually send all Thai workers home. In three 
more months, the contracts of most Thai workers will have 
expired and they will have to return home. 
  According to Piti, Libya's annoucement was first regarded as 
merely a threat. Recently, the Libyan Government sent circulars 
to employers telling them to stop hiring Thai workers. Piti 
said he could not estimate how many Thai workers would be sent 
home, noting that the number of Thai workers is quite large. He 
said: "About 800 workers placed by my firm now remain in Libya. 
All of them would have to return home in three months." 
  Piti said, among Middle East countries, Libya has a very big 
demand for foreign workers. Huge projects, such as gas and oil 
distilleries, are at the beginning stage. Thousands of Thai 
workers could have found jobs there if it had not been for the 
international political problem. 
  Piti added that Libya and Iran pay the highest wages in the 
Middle East. Despite the number of Thai workers in Liyba, the 
Thai Government and the Labor Ministry have not attempted to 
solve the problem on their behalf. As a solution, job placement 
firms will probably look to Iran, where wages are also high.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Iran Government Must Not Make Accusations </F>
or Interfere in Thailand's Internal Affairs"] 
  [Text] The Iranian Embassy in Bangkok issued a statement 
on 9 June urging the Thai Government to be vigilant against 
Zionists who use Thailand as a tool to discredit its government. 
The statement said the Zionists had created a false terrorist 
scenario. It added that Iran opposed and condemned all forms of 
terrorism against the life of innocent people and regarded them 
as inhumane and un- Islamic. 
  Earlier, the Iranian Government through its Foreign Ministry 
protested against the Thai police's arrest of three Iranians on 
charges of colluding to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok to 
avenge the Hebron massacre. One of those arrested was suspected 
of being the driver of the bomb-laden truck which was involved 
in an accident near the Israeli Embassy and who had subsequently 
fled abroad. 
  The Thai officials did not disclose how they had obtained 
information about the terrorists. By charging that the Zionists 
had created a false scenario, the Iranian Embassy was probably 
referring to any Jewish group or person. Zionist is the 
definition of a Jewish who seeks to create a Jewish nation. A 
Jew who believes in this doctrine works openly or secretly, and 
sometimes illegally, to achieve his goal without regard to the 
effect his action may have on others. Based on this 
characteristic of Zionism, Iran has charged that Thailand was 
being used by Zionists as a tool to create hatred toward it. 
  As a member of the mass media not under government control, 
we wish to argue against the Iranian Government. Thailand is 
independent and neutral in its relations with other countries. 
It treats all countries equally. It does not engage in 
prejudice against any person. If a person is suspected of a 
crime, he will be arrested for questioning. It is inappropriate 
for the Iranian Government to use Thailand as an arena for 
international political conflict, particularly as Thailand has 
good relations with Israel as well. 
  A religious dispute exists between Iran and Israel. It is 
inappropriate to make an accusation against Thailand over the 
arrest of Iranians suspected of a crime in Thailand. The Thai 
Government has the perfect right to investigate and try the 
suspects free from interference by any government. 
  We do not want to see Thailand used by any country as an 
arena for waging a cold war or any kind of war. Regarding the 
Iranian Government's reminder to Thai officials to promptly 
process the case for the sake of clarity, Thai officials are 
already doing so with due care. A reminder from any government 
is not necessary because the case affects Thailand's security. 
The Thai people earnestly desire the case to be solved so that 
Thailand will not be viewed suspiciously by other countries, 
which would affect foreign investment and trade. 
  If the suspects did not commit any wrong doing or if there 
is 
insufficient evidence, we are confident that the Thai court will 
dismiss the case. Therefore, we urge the Iranian Government to 
treat Thailand fairly. It should not feel that Thai officials 
might be so gullible as to use information from the Zionists to 
convict the suspects. 
  The Iranian Government's action is regarded as interference 
in Thailand's internal affairs. If it persists, obstacles will 
result in its diplomatic relations with Thailand, despite the 
fact that trade and political relations between the countries 
have been proceeding smoothly with very few problems. Please 
cease your interference in an internal affair that affects only 
Thailand's security and public safety.

  [Text] Justice Minister Sawai Phatthano has informed 
PRACHACHAT THURAKIT of the progress of the draft bill on the 
establishment of an intellectual property and international 
trade court. He said his ministry forwarded the bill to the 
secretary general to the prime minister two weeks ago. He 
believes the bill will be considered by the cabinet soon. 
  Sawai said his ministry had already reviewed the bill two or 
three times. He believes the bill is now in the office of 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who will make the 
final scrutiny before placing it on the agenda of a cabinet 
meeting. 
  Sawai said: "The establishment of the intellectual property 
and international trade court is just as important as the 
administrative court because it concerns national interest. It 
is also the prime minister's wish to bring it to Parliament 
promptly. Regarding the charge that the establishment of the 
court is the result of a U.S. threat of retaliation under 
Article 301, the Justice Ministry has given an assurance that 
the issues are unrelated. Thailand is a proud country; why must 
it succumb to U.S. demands? The ministry is considering 
national interests in setting up the intellectual property and 
international trade court. The court's structure will follow 
international lines. On this point, the United States may enjoy 
some benefits and may be pleased by the action which Thailand 
has taken." 
  The Cabinet decided in May 1993 to order an establishment of 
the intellectual property and international trade court under 
the Justice Ministry. A committee was formed to study the 
court's structure. The committee then formed a subcommittee to 
draft relevant laws. The subcommittee drafted a bill containing 
43 articles and presented its opinions on the advantages and 
weaknesses of an intellectual property and international law 
court. 
  The advantages include the following: 1. The judges are 
required to have a background in intellectual property and 
international trade. The qualifications of associate judges are 
also set. 2. The chief judge has the power to set regulations. 
3. Appeals are filed directly with the Supreme Court. The 
weaknesses are: 1. The accused will have only two courts to hear 
their cases. 2. Sentencing will be done by the provincial 
courts.

  [Text] More than 100 leading academics yesterday made 
public an open letter demanding the government and the 
opposition jointly set up a special committee to draft a new, 
more democratic constitution. 
  One hundred and thirteen intellectuals from institutions 
across the country -- including Chulalongkon, Chiang Mai, 
Songkhla Nakharin, Khon Kaen, Mahidon and Thammasat universities 
-- signed their names to the letter. 
  Organizers said it would be submitted to House Speaker Marut 
Bunnak on Monday. 
  The letter said all politicians should cooperate to resolve 
the political impasse fuelled by activist Chalat Worachat's 
hunger strike as soon as possible, before a national crisis 
develops. 
  The academics accused the Democrat Party of being insincere 
in its effort to ease the current political tensions. 
  Efforts to end Chalat's hunger strike should not be used as 
a 
bargaining chip by any political group seeking to take advantage 
of the situation. 
  All politicians, and in particular government MPs, should be 
decisive in resolving the impasse, the letter said. Opposition 
MPs had already declared their full support for Chalat's demand 
for a House committee to draft a new charter. 
  Surichai Wankaeo, deputy dean of Chulalongkon University's 
Political Science Faculty, said the letter was aimed at 
prompting the government to introduce more democratic changes. 
  He said if democracy was enhanced Chalat may decide to quit 
his hunger strike. 
  Academic Suchai Trirat said the people should not consider 
Chalat's hunger strike "pressure outside Parliament" as Chalat's 
purpose was to help develop the parliamentary system. 
  "Politics does not mean only the people inside Parliament," 
he said.

    [Editorial Report] The 14 June issues of four Thai dailies 
-- SIAM RAT, THAI RAT, MATICHON and NAEO NA -- carry editorials 
on the current political situation, which has arisen from the 
demand for constitutional reform by hunger striker Chalat 
Worachat and his supporters and detractors both in and outside 
parliament. 
  Bangkok SIAM RAT in Thai on page 3 carries a 600-word 
editorial, entitled: "Tackle the Political Crisis." It says: 
"The call for constitutional reform initiated by Chalat 
Worachat by staging a hunger strike has evolved into a call for 
political reform. Chalat himself is probably surprised by the 
way things have developed, which are different from his four 
original demands. However, it appears that Chalat has no 
objection to the new development." 
  The editorial concludes: "The current political crisis 
should develop in a direction that benefits society and the 
country as a whole, not any particular group or political party." 
  Bangkok NAEO NA in Thai on page 3 carries a 600-word 
editorial, entitled: "Dissolve the Parliament." The editorial 
says: "The current political situation has gone beyond Chalat's 
hunger strike since organizations for democracy and academics 
have joined the campaign for political reform." The dispute 
within the Phalang Tham Party over whether to support the 
campaign "could result in the party withdrawing itself from the 
coalition government. The resulting political crisis could lead 
to a clash between mobs of the opposite sides and a blood bath 
as Dr. Prawet Wasi warned earlier. This situation could be 
exploited by certain groups to seize power. Therefore, the best 
solution is to forget pride and dissolve the parliament in order 
to return power to the people to avoid such a seizure of power." 
  Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on page 2 carries a 700-word 
editorial, which is entitled: "Open and Sincere." It says: 
"The differences of ideas triggered by Chalat Worachat's hunger 
strike have increasingly widened. A cause for this development 
is the inflexible position of the government leader and his 
political party. Another cause is probably the confusion over 
the numerous proposals by various sides on how to solve the 
issue. The unclear positions of the various coalition parties, 
which try to conceal their stands to gain political advantage, 
are also to blame." 
  The editorial concludes: "In this situation, we appeal to 
all sides which are carrying on political activities to do so 
openly and appropriately inform the public. Do not conceal 
these activities to gain political advantage. Only sincerity 
and determination will help relieve the current situation. In 
particular, the government leader, who is responsible for what 
happens in the country, promptly must play his role. He cannot 
just cling firmly to his stand regardless of how the situation 
may develop. The question, which the government must answer, 
is: What must be done to solve the situation peacefully? The 
question is no longer about who is right and who is wrong." 
  Bangkok THAI RAT in Thai carries a 700-word editorial on 
page 
3 entitled: "To The Democrat Party." The editorial says: "The 
political situation has reached the point that a decision has to 
be made. Chalat's demands have received considerable support by 
democracy-loving groups, although some of them disagreed with 
the protest method. It is possible to have the House of 
Representatives form a commission to study or redraft the 
constitution. Whether or not its recommendations can be put 
into use is another matter. 
  "To relieve political tension and prevent divisiveness among 
the government political parties and the situation from 
worsening any further, we appeal to the prime minister and the 
Democrat Party to listen to the views of other parties in the 
coalition government and democracy-loving people. The 
constitution amendment may not be achieved today, but it is time 
to start now."

  [Text] Thailand is expected to double its share to about 
1.8 percent of total world trade with exports worth 2.5 trillion 
baht in the year 2000. 
  The forecast emerged yesterday from a meeting of a 
subcommittee considering the country's competitiveness, chaired 
by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Phanitchaphak. 
  It is outlining plans to increase the country's exports 
until 
the year 2000. 
  An adviser to Dr Suphachai, Dr Thirana Phongmakaphat, said 
Thai exports were likely to expand 13 percent-15.5 percent 
annually in the period. 
  The estimates were also based on world economic growth of 5 
percent a year but this figure would have to be readjusted in 
line with trends. 
  The subcommittee outlined 15 measures to hoost exrports, 
including promotions, increased efficiency and a greater role 
for regional groups such as the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation organisation in technology development. 
  The subcommittee also suggested measures be adopted for 
industries in which Thailand has an advantage over its rivals, 
such as agriculture, textiles, gems and jewellery, electronics 
and printing and packaging.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Government Decision, Party Resolution, Public </F>
Opinion; What Really Counts Is National Survival"] 
  [Text] In our capacity as the people of a country with a 
democratic government, we have no doubt that national survival 
depends on the fact that the minority must accept opinions of 
the majority, that the rules are made by the voice of the 
majority, no matter the government, political party, or any 
interest group. Yet, this must go in accordance with the trend 
of the society and reflect the desire of the majority -- a true 
majority, and not a majority by some who claim to represent the 
people since that would be a distortion of the democratic 
principle. 
  We disagree with the prime minister's stand concerning the 
current situation. He said that government decisions must be 
used as guidance whereas resolutions of political parties can be 
taken into account as composite. We, on the other hand, think 
that, in the present situation, the government decision, which 
mainly reflects the thinking of the Democrat Party, rather 
serves to "block" than "solve" the current crisis. It is 
different in nature from the motion proposed by the Phalang Tham 
Party that a committee be set up to compile and rewrite a draft 
constitution, or the proposal made by the New Aspiration Party 
that Article 211 of the Constitution be amended to pave the way 
for the appointment of a constitution drafting council. 
  The Democrat Party has been trying to block all passages 
leading to a solution to the problem. It pressured the Phalang 
Tham Party to have the party withdraw its motion, claiming 
political etiquette as a pretext. It also tried to confuse the 
public about the New Aspiration Party's proposal to amend 
Article 211 of the Constitution saying the move was illegal and 
that the party should have proposed such an amendment to the 
Special House Committee Scrutinizing the Draft Constitution. 
  By talking about political etiquette and appealing for 
proper 
steps to be followed to solve the problem, the Democrat Party 
made us realize that it has lost sight of the real problem; the 
nation has already been divided into two lines of thinking with 
a tendency towards violence at any time. This is not the right 
time to interpret the Constitution by the letters of the words 
-- what is legal or illegal. At this moment, we must join 
together in order to find a solution to avoid confrontation. 
  We support the move taken by the Organization for Political 
Reforms that undesirable violence must be avoided at all costs. 
We support the organization's appeal to the speaker of the House 
of Representatives to table the Phalang Tham Party's motion on 
agenda for deliberations at the earliest, either on Wednesday or 
Thursday. We call on the parliamentarians to approve the motion 
in order to pave the way for the drafting of a constitution of 
the people. This may seem difficult to materialize, but the 
process will enable the people to see more clearly the true 
color of political parties prior to another general election. 
  No matter what the option -- the Phalang Tham Party's motion 
or the proposal by the New Aspiration Party, it is quite clear 
now that the government will not be able to control the majority 
in the parliament. In the name of the people of a country under 
a democratic government, we would like to ask the government to 
return the "power" to the people so that they can make a 
decision by themselves in keeping with the trend of society. 
That would be the most correct way to solve this national 
crisis at the time we are experiencing the absence of 
"leadership."

  [Text] In answering an AFP correspondent inquiring about 
Vietnam's reaction on the IAEA's [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] decision to pose punitive sanctions on the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, a spokesman of our Foreign Ministry 
on 14 June said: 
  Vietnam follows with deep concern recent developments of the 
nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. We believe that all 
members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, have 
similar obligations in the nuclear issue. We are always 
persistent in our belief that the solution for this complicated 
issue can only be reached through resolute and serious 
negotiations between the parties concerned on the basis of 
equality and respect to each other's independence and 
sovereignty and to international laws. 
  All actions at variance with that direction will only worsen 
the already complicated situation, and will harm the trend of 
peace, stability, and cooperation for the Pacific region which 
all countries in the region are striving to maintain.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 13 -- President of Kazakhstan N. 
Nazarbayev received in Almaty this morning Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet who arrived there yesterday for an official friendship 
visit. 
  President Nazarbayev expressed his wish that Vietnam would 
share her experience in the economic renovation and inflation 
restriction with Kazakhstan. He said that in recent years, the 
relations of cooperation between Vietnam and Kazakhstan was 
slowly developed, the two-way trade value was at low level due 
to historic circumstance. At present, he said, in new conditions 
and with goodwill developing, their traditional cooperative and 
friendly relations should have a new step of development in such 
relations. 
  The president highly valued Vietnam's achievements and 
experience in its renovation process, especially in the economic 
field. He affirmed that such achievements have been a great 
encouragement source to the Kazakhstan people. President 
Nazarbayev also expressed his belief that Vo Van Kiet's current 
visit would usher in a new era in the relations of friendship 
and cooperation between the two states and peoples. He asked 
P.M. Kiet to convey his best regards to President Le Duc Anh. 
  For his part P.M. Kiet said that Vietnam has always followed 
with keen interest the Kazakhstan's situation, and attached 
great importance to the consolidation and enhancement of the 
friendship and cooperation with Kazakhstan and that the 
delegation's first visit to Kazakhstan would be a foundation for 
the promotion of friendly and cooperative relations between the 
two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

<F P=106> [First part of report compiled by National Assembly Standing </F>
committee on voters' views submitted to Fifth Session of Ninth 
National Assembly] 
  [Text] The Implementation of Duties in the First Six Months 
of 1994. 
  I. In the socioeconomic field. 
  General speaking, voters in all localities unanimously 
agreed 
that the socioeconomic results achieved in recent years are 
encouraging. The economy enjoys a relatively high development 
rate. The life of a large part of the public has been 
significantly improved. These further confirm that the 
renovative line in all social aspects initiated by our party is 
very correct and appropriate with every passing day. 
  In agriculture production, the 1993-1994 winter-spring rice 
crop yielded good results throughout the entire country. 
Agricultural commodities are abundant. In general, the life of 
the peasants continues to improve. Voters in all localities 
hold that all party's lines and policies and state laws relating 
to agricultural production have significantly accelerated 
agricultural production, especially the Fifth Party Plenum 
resolution on the development of agriculture and rural areas. 
  However, a series of problems remained to be solved. The 
voters' suggestions mainly concentrate on the following issues: 
  1. The government needs to study and outline a management 
model for agricultural cooperatives in the new economic 
structure. At the same time, the government should introduce 
policies to make the use of land in rural areas more reasonable 
and just. At present, the long-term granting of land to peasant 
households is a correct line, which provides encouragement and 
peace of mind for the peasants, and allows them to carry out 
their production, improve the soil, and increase their harvests. 
However, the unfair and unreasonable granting of land still 
occurs amongst peasants and non-peasants. Land is still 
registered in the name of deceased people. Newborn people are 
not given land for their future production, and houses are still 
allowed to be built on five-percent reserved land. 
  2. The government needs to continue its policy of providing 
subsidies to agricultural products. The subsidizing of 
agricultural products is an issue brought up many times by 
voters throughout the country. At present, the imbalance of 
agricultural and industrial goods is being adjusted too slowly. 
This causes concern among peasants. 
  Voters in most provinces and cities suggest that the 
government should reduce the price of materials used in 
agriculture production and cut down the fee for the irrigation 
service because the current irrigation fee of 12 percent is too 
high. Voters in some localities suggest that the government 
should reduce agriculture tax rates and introduce more practical 
regulations so that agriculture promotion organizations can 
actually provide more support to agriculture production 
development. 
  3. The government needs to urgently improve its credit 
service and capital management to ensure loans to the right 
people, reduce embarrassing and inconvenient procedures, and 
increase the amount of credit and the repayment periods with 
reasonable interest rates to create conditions for peasants to 
improve production and business. They also suggest that the 
government end the situation where poor men can not obtain loans 
while rich men can repeatedly ask for them. In some localities, 
voters suggest that the government should instruct the banking 
sector to provide six-month loans for yearly crops and loans for 
more than two years for perennial plants. 
  4. While the entire country is enjoying a good harvest, 
central provinces, especially Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue, are 
still suffering continuously poor harvests due to harsh weather 
and frequent natural disasters. Voters in these provinces 
suggest that the government should adopt practical measures to 
help peasants suffering from poor harvests stabilize their life 
and develop production. 
  Regarding industrial production and small industrial and 
handicraft production, voters in many localities hold that, with 
the challenge of the market economy, industrial production and 
small industrial and handicraft production continue to stand 
firm and develop, helping to increase the state budget revenue 
and meeting most of the public demand for consumers goods. 
However, voters in some localities suggest that the government 
should introduce concrete taxation and credit policies for 
different economic sectors to ensure the leading role of the 
state economic sector. At present, state economic units have to 
shoulder a greater share of the national budget than the 
nonstate economic units. Therefore, the state economic sector 
and the collective economic sector can not compete with other 
economic sectors. In order to satisfactorily carry out 
government decree No. 388 on the rearrangement of state economic 
units, voters suggest that the government should instruct 
ministries which have production units to closely coordinate 
with local government so that the decree can be executed 
correctly and that, after the rearrangement, all state 
enterprises will continue to carry out their business 
effectively. Together with the rearrangement of state 
enterprises, voters also suggest that the government should 
continue the program to introduce a share holding system in 
state enterprises. 
  As on previous occasions, voters in many localities suggest 
that the government pay more attention to the agricultural 
product and foodstuff processing industry, balance investment in 
construction, and ensure a reasonable and equal distribution of 
industrial establishments in all localities in order to quickly 
consume products made by the peasants and overcome the current 
disparity of wealth in different provinces. Together with 
efforts to give priority to the development of the processing 
industry, voters suggest that the government should adopt 
suitable policies on investment in and marketing of products 
made by small industry and handicraft enterprises, continue to 
improve structure for the acceleration of small industry and 
handicraft production, and generate more jobs for the laboring 
people. 
  Regarding imports and exports, voters in many localities are 
concerned about the fierce competition between domestic goods 
and imported goods, especially among staple goods. Some of our 
good quality products such as electric fans, thermos, and 
ceramic products do not sell well because of their high price. 
Voters suggest that the government should apply policies to 
protect domestic production and resolutely stop smuggling. 
  According to reports presented by some National Assembly 
delegations, many voters hold that the rapid increase of 
production has lead to a large inventory, causing losses to 
business enterprises. In Ho Chi Minh City, the number of 
enterprises running at a loss is nearly 40 percent of the total 
enterprises. At present, some foreign companies are selling 
their products below cost in order to bankrupt Vietnamese 
enterprises before they can monopolize our market. Together 
with their market manipulation, foreign companies use high 
salaries to attract good Vietnamese technicians and workers. 
They also find measures to evade the control of the Vietnamese 
Government organs. 
  In order to overcome the aforementioned situation and ensure 
a stable development for our enterprises in the market 
mechanism, voters in Ho Chi Minh City have suggested to the 
government the following practical measures: 
  -- Conduct reviews to evaluate the socioeconomic 
effectiveness of the foreign investment. 
  -- Study the concretization of strategic targets in the 
issuance of investment licenses. 
  -- Overcome loopholes in management in order to draw 
experiences for new projects. 
  The government needs to study and establish a clear market 
strategy to develop and fully exploit the local advantages of 
different localities and sectors and provide adequate protection 
for locally made products. Modern technologies should be 
attracted by encouraging the setting up of companies which are 
in the business of renting equipment and the setting up of 
branches of foreign companies which can facilitate purchase 
through installment plans in order to quickly accelerate our 
national modernization. 
  The information service on the market situation and new 
technologies should be satisfactorily organized to help foreign 
companies set up businesses in Vietnam and assist Vietnamese 
companies to choose the most efficient measures and counterparts 
for their business. The vestiges of the old bureaucracy and 
subsidy structure, which limit the creative ability of the 
laboring people and obstruct the application of new 
technologies, such as the practice of wage control and the 
banning of a high percentage for machinery depreciation, should 
be totally destroyed. Plans should be outlined to train and 
retrain the contingent of key cadres on modern management 
knowledge, public relation technique, and negotiation skills in 
dealing with foreign counterparts. 
  Regarding finance and the state budget, the voters' opinions 
mainly concentrate on taxation and debt solvency. Regarding the 
taxation policy, voters in many localities continue to suggest 
that the government should not yet start applying new tax rates 
on housing land in rural areas because our peasants are still 
too poor. Therefore, the government should collect the housing 
land tax at the same rates as the land using tax. In some 
areas, the voters suggest that the government should leave 50-60 
percent of land tax to local governments for infrastructure 
construction. Voters in some localities suggest the government 
to consider authorizing villages to keep 20 percent of 
agriculture tax instead of 10 percent because at present village 
budgets are very small and do not meet local expenses. In 
villages, revenue resources are few while demand on expenses is 
still too great. Therefore, grassroots activities are facing 
numerous difficulties. 
  With respect to debts owned to the public by the government, 
voters in many localities suggest that the government should 
further study and adopt more practical policies to solve its 
debts to the public during the anti-French and anti-American 
wars and during the period after 1975. People in the Western 
part of South Vietnam have complained that the government still 
owes them a lot of money from when it bought paddy and rice from 
them. In some localities, the voters suggest that the 
government should finally settle government credit notes issued 
during the agrarian reform. Many families received the notes 
during the reform. Now they are facing hardship in their life. 
Some people left their children with government credit notes 
when they passed away, and the notes have not yet been paid. 
  Moreover, voters in some localities hold that the planning 
for revenue collection and expenditure assigned to different 
localities is sill unreasonable and not based on a uniform 
calculation. 
  Voters in Ho Chi Minh City hold that it is unreasonable for 
the Revenue General Department to set up a branch office to 
collect taxes directly at the Tan Thuan Processing Zone, because 
in so doing they strip the city of a source of funds which will 
be used to repay large amounts of debt borrowed to invest in the 
construction of the processing zone. 
  On capital construction, voters in most localities, 
especially those living in mountain regions, suggest the state 
pay more attention to building up infrastructure for localities, 
with appropriate investment policies and good coordination with 
people's contributions. Voters think that the current 
infrastructure situation and other social facilities such as 
public roads, electricity and water supplies, hospitals in many 
rural areas especially in mountainous and remote areas or the 
former revolutionary bases, are falling far behind compared with 
those in cities. Many voters suggest that the National Assembly 
should have a separate resolution on the infrastructure issue. 
  The issue of management in capital construction had been 
raised by voters several times in previous National Assembly 
meetings. This time, voters again suggest that the state quickly 
perfect the management mechanism in capital construction and 
strengthen inspection of investment projects, of the allocation 
of capital for projects at various levels, and of the building 
process of projects at the national level. Good management of 
capital investment is essential to avoid embezzlement, bribery, 
and waste. Voters in some localities express concern about the 
building of the north-south 500-kilovolt powerline and suggest 
the government report on this issue to the National Assembly in 
this session. At some places there have been suggestions for 
death sentences for perpetrators of sabotage activities which 
cause damage to national major construction projects such as the 
Hoa Binh Hydroelectricity Plant, the north-south 500-kilovolt 
powerline, and expressways. Voters in some localities repeat 
their suggestion that the state soon have a consistent policy on 
house pricing to ensure equality and to respond adequately to 
aspirations of many cadres and state employees. 
  II. In security and national defense fields. 
  Voters in many localities hold that achievements in security 
and national defense contributes significantly to our national 
socioeconomic development. The consolidation of a spirit of 
readiness for combat has brought good success in the past 
several years. Voters suggest, however, that the state have 
more active measures to strengthen the ability to safeguard the 
country and localities especially critical areas, directions, 
and lines. Voters in some localities propose a budget increase 
for the national defense sector and the strengthening of our 
armed forces. The state should quickly establish a law on 
national security, on borders and border protection, and approve 
the amended law on military obligation in this session in order 
to promote the quality of the army and to respond to the needs 
of national protection in the new situation. 
  III. In cultural and social fields. 
  Voters in many localities hold that cultural and art 
activities have scored some progress lately. Circulation of 
cultural products that are noneducational andd detrimental to 
young people and to people's morality gradually have been 
suppressed. The promulgation of the publishing law has brought 
practical results in the management of cultural and art 
activities. Voters in some localities, however, still think 
that the operational mechanism of cultural activities in the new 
situation is not yet clear, and management of the export and 
import of cultural products still shows flaws. Examples of new 
cultured lifestyle building at the grassroots level have not 
been used to campaign for more examples. Cultural interaction 
between mountain regions and lowlands is still too limited. The 
cultural life of compatriots living in mountains, remote areas, 
and in former revolutionary bases is still too meager. According 
to many voters, Vietnam television and radio networks as well as 
some papers carry too many advertisements and these 
advertisements are of poor quality and noneducational. 
  Voters suggest that the amount of advertisement be cut down 
and be replaced by useful programs such as law education and 
education of national traditions. Local voters also want to 
hear and listen to more programs from central networks. Voters 
also request stronger management of parabola antenna 
installments in hotels, restaurants, and private houses to 
prevent recording of films and videos which are noneducational. 
The cultural and information authorities should have clear 
stipulations on this matter. 
  Regarding education, voters in many localities took into 
account the recent progress of the education and training 
sector. The application of many forms of schools and courses as 
well as of rich and flexible training activities has met actual 
requirements and created conditions for more children to attend 
school. On the contrary, voters in other localities maintained 
that at present, instead of making progress, the education 
sector is facing the danger of being left farther behind with 
each passing day. Therefore, they suggested the National 
Assembly review the contents of educational policies and lines. 
  As in the past, voters in almost all localities suggested 
that the state and education sector continue to adopt practical 
policies and measures to improve the quality of education and 
train a contingent of young cadres having an equal level of 
professionalism with other countries. Due efforts must be made 
to improve the knowledge of teachers, encourage outstanding 
students and young men to attend teachers training schools, 
include foreign language training in Level II schools in the 
countryside, attach importance to the building of material bases 
and other learning facilities for children, abolish classrooms 
that have leaky roofs or are seriously damaged, and get rid of 
third shift class meetings. Steps must be taken to lessen 
contributions and henceforth, reduce the number of school 
dropouts. 
  Many voters suggested that the state continue to work out a 
textbook subsidization policy to benefit students. Voters in 
many localities also suggested that the state review the current 
system of education decentralization and budget allocation based 
on areas of activities. On the contrary, voters in some 
localities concurred with the policy on budget allocation 
management by the education sector and on giving full power to 
school principals to manage teachers and handle special issues 
and budget spending. Voters in many localities suggested that 
the state review the wage system for teachers in charge of 
management because many teachers are transferred to a management 
position after they have done an excellent teaching job, but 
still earn wages lower than those paid to teachers. 
  Voters in a number of localities, particularly mountain 
provinces, suggested that the state provide adequate budget 
allocations to compulsory elementary education and 
anti-illiteracy activities, particularly in high-altitude areas 
where the illiteracy rate remains very high. Voters in other 
localities suggested the state adopt a practical policy toward 
kindergarten and Level I teachers, especially those in the 
countryside and mountain regions where they have to work very 
hard whereas the wage and allowance system is very low and life 
is rife with many difficulties. 
  Regarding public health care, voters in many localities 
noted 
that so far, the public health care sector has made progress in 
a number of domains. However, like in the past, many voters 
maintained that no due attention has been paid to the 
development of grassroots public health care system. Generally 
speaking, the grassroots public health care system is still 
deficient in terms of cadres, medicines, and medical facilities. 
At present, the living conditions of the contingent of 
grassroots public health care cadres remain very difficult. 
Voters in a number of localities maintained that though the 
prime minister of the government had issued Decision 58/CP on 
the policy toward grassroots public health care cadres, the 
implementation of this decision still faces many difficulties, 
especially in terms of budget allocation. 
  Many voters agreed with the need to organize health 
insurance. However, voters in a number of localities maintained 
that health insurance coverage remains formalistic, that the 
application of a health insurance coverage based on a number of 
designated hospitals causes difficulties and inconvenience to 
patients whereas people capable of making direct payments still 
receive better care and treatment, that efforts to reorganize 
the hospital system and improve the ethical conduct of 
physicians have not yet brought about the expected results, and 
that the poor meet with many difficulties in seeking medical 
care and treatment. 
  According to reports by a number of National Assembly 
groups, 
voters hope that the state works out a health insurance policy 
to cover not only cadres and state officials but also peasants, 
with attention being given to poor households, and that the 
family unit should be used as the basis for the issuance of 
health insurance cards. 
  Voters in many localities also suggested that the state 
adopt 
a policy to give hospital fee exemption or reduction to social 
welfare recipients and needy people or organize charitable 
hospitals to serve the poor.

  [Text] Port Moresby, June 14 (AFP) -- Hopes of a settlement 
in Bougainville's bloody six-year civil war have risen, 
following successful talks between senior Papua New Guinea 
officials and rebel leaders at the weekend, officials said 
Tuesday. 
  The talks held in the Solomon Islands and hailed as 
historic, 
were said to have ended with an agreement signed by both sides, 
paving the way to fresh peace negotiations. 
  The negotiations will be aimed at ending the secessionist 
conflict on Papua New Guinea's copper rich island province. 
  Some estimates have put the death toll in the area as high 
as 
3,000, with casualties occurring either in fighting between 
rebels and Papua New Guinea forces, or indirectly through 
neglect resulting from lack of adequate food and medical care. 
  Port Moresby was represented at the meeting in Honiara by 
the 
secretary of the prime minister's department, Brown Bai, and 
foreign affairs secretary Gabriel Dusava while the self-styled 
interim government of Bougainville was represented by Martin 
Miriori, Mike Forster and Moses Havini. 
  Dusava confirmed the signing of the agreement but said 
details would be released officially by foreign minister Sir 
Julius Chan later this week. 
  According to reports from Honiara the agreement states: "The 
purpose of this series of consultations is to pave way for peace 
and that must be the ultimate objective of the meeting." 
  The interim government has meantime released a statement 
saying certain undertakings were agreed on and signed by both 
sides, a move which would open the way for further progressive 
negotiations. 
  "I believe that there is now a real commitment to peace by 
both sides," spokesman Mike Forster said. 
  "We are treading very carefully so as to keep both sides 
happy as we approach the pan-Bougainville conference." 
  Forster said the meeting was only the second in what was 
hoped would become a long series of consultative meetings aimed 
at constructive measures to achieve peace. 
  "By the end of the consultations this time, there was a 
sense 
of trust and understanding between the two negotiators which had 
been missing for years," Forster said. 
  Further talks may continue in Australia, he said. 
  Prime Minister Paias Wingti, "mindful" of two failed peace 
accords since the outbreak of hostilities, is said to be taking 
a cautious approach to the new dialogue. 
  He has said the talks would be low-key to avoid building up 
false hope. 
  The agreement commits both sides to negotiations and to 
implementing as soon as possible a schedule within which a 
mechanism can be put in place for a peaceful settlement of the 
crisis. 
  This latest development follows moves by Port Moresby to 
seek 
the assistance of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and the Solomons in 
setting up a regional peacekeeping force to monitor the peace 
process. 
  Each has agreed in principle to establishment of the force 
which would use soldiers provided by Fiji, the Solomons and 
Tonga.

  [Text] Progress towards a negotiated peace in Bougainville 
is reported to have taken a step forward with representatives of 
the Papua New Guinea [PNG] government and the secessionists 
signing an agreement to hold further talks soon. The agreement 
was reached at talks in Honiara hosted by Solomon Islands Prime 
Minister Francis Billy Hilly. Among those attending the meeting 
were the secretary to PNG's prime minister, (Brown Bau), and the 
secessionist international representative, (Moses Havini). 
  Sources in the Solomon Islands Government said the meeting 
paved the way for a summit conference of Bougainville leaders 
representing both the secessionists and the PNG Government in 
Honiara next week. Solomon Islands radio said the summit will be 
part of the consultative process to establish dialogue in the 
lead up to proposed Pan-Bougainville peace conference.

  [Text] Papua New Guinea's [PNG] minister for finance and 
planning, Masket Iangalio, has painted a gloomy picture of the 
country's economy and says government revenue is well below 
expectations. 
  In an interview with the Port Moresby newspaper, THE 
NATIONAL, Mr. Iangalio said that although export prices for oil 
and other commodities were rising and PNG was experiencing a 
high level of economic growth, the government budget deficit was 
unacceptably high, and foreign reserves were falling to crisis 
level. He blamed Papua New Guinea's financial troubles in part 
on the closure of the Bougainville copper mine, over optimistic 
estimates of government income and success of budget, and 
uncontrolled spending by the public sector over a number of 
years.

  [Text] Improving the transport system will be a first and 
crucial step in the promotion of trade and investment to support 
growth and diversification in the sub-region, Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday. 
  Mr Suphachai was speaking at the third 
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle (IMT-GT) tripartite 
meeting in Indonesia. 
  The Royal Thai government has made an allocation of US$36 
million in the budget for 1995 for the creation of physical 
infrastructure and related facilities he pointed out. 
  The Thai government fully supports the IMT-GT project and 
would like to concretise co-operation projects, particularly in 
the fields of trade and investment, infrastructure linkages, and 
agreements in fishery development, he said. 
  "We should select, to start off with projects that are most 
feasible, least costly and therefore eligible for concessional 
financing," he observed. 
  "We must collectively agree on fair terms in the utilisation 
of the infrastructural network," he stated. 
  Private sector companies must be encouraged to work more 
closely together, as the projects will have to be executed by 
them. Governments will offer the right framework and the 
necessary facilities. 
  Dr Suphachai observed that the Thai side has made 
significant 
progress in several infrastructural projects. 
  These include upgrading the road linking Satun province to 
Songkhla province, paving the way for the creation of a lower 
southern seaboard area, and upgrading the seaport in Pattani and 
Satun provinces to support sea transportation links between 
Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
  The engineering design for a bridge on the Narathiwat border 
to facilitate more cross-border trade with Malaysia has been 
completed. 
  The industrial zone projects, particularly at Chaulung in 
Songkhla province, are being speeded up and should be completed 
in the third quarter of this year, said Dr Suphachai. 
  He went on: "These projects, when completed, will help 
reduce 
the weakness of the infrastructural links between southern 
Thailand and northern Malaysia. 
  "Improvement in the air and shipping services in the 
sub-region should be treated as a priority. 
  "Our IMT-GT sub-regional economic co-operation is now 
becoming widely known as an effective instrument of AFTA 
intra-regional cooperation within the context of free trade 
areas that can also help in the redistribution of income to the 
regional areas."

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday, the 
Asia-Pacific region needed a new regional security arrangement 
based on the idea of the interdependence and equity of nations 
within a global community. 
  It must also principally serve the interests of the people 
of 
the region, not the vested interests of arms merchants and 
defence industries, he added. 
  We must progress from containment, or even mere peaceful 
co-existence, towards productive and mutually beneficial 
collaboration in all spheres of activity, he said when 
addressing the eighth Asia-Pacific Roundtable on Confidence 
Building and Conflict Reduction in the Pacific, here. 
  He said that for Asians in particular, such an arrangement 
must provide the right kind of environment for the full 
flowering of their economic, social and cultural potentials. 
  We must also [word indistinct] a new global partnership for 
peace, one based on mutual respect and genuine understanding 
between nations, large and small, North and South, East and West.

<F P=106> [Statement signed by 19 "distinguished thinkers" attending </F>
an informal meeting of 10 Southeast Asian states in Manila 30-31 
May: "Towards a Southeast Asia of Peace and Prosperity"] 
  [Text] We believe that Southeast Asia should be a 
community. Collectively, this community should be a major 
political, economic, cultural, and moral entity on the world 
stage in the 21st century. 
  Geography has consigned us to living in close proximity with 
each other, and geography has made it incumbent upon us to meet, 
live, and work together as good neighbours. Throughout our 
common history, trade and cultural exchanges have characterised 
our relations with one another. However, we have often failed 
the tests of good neighbourliness. Conflicts and wars have 
arisen, and geographical proximity meant that in such conflicts 
and wars each of us ultimately lost something in the process. 
  Geography has given us a shared destiny, and the fact of 
this 
shared destiny, we believe, means that we must strive to build a 
Southeast Asian community. 
  This community should be a pluralistic community. 
  It should be a community of equal and sovereign states, each 
with its own identity, preferred interests, valued 
relationships, and conceptions of development and progress, but 
also with a sense of common destiny, shared perceptions of its 
own future, and common commitments to the enhancement of 
regional peace and prosperity, fundamental human values, and the 
basic principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. 
  Furthermore, this Southeast Asian community should also be a 
community of peace and prosperity. The states and peoples of 
Southeast Asia should strive to create structures of 
relationships and of shared values, which enable them to live in 
peace with one another and with the rest of the world, to engage 
in mutually rewarding cooperation among themselves and with 
others, and to develop the potential of their own human and 
natural resources to the fullest extent, so that prosperity can 
be shared by all. 
  This Southeast Asian community of peace and prosperity that 
we envision should be a model of international cooperation for 
the rest of the global community. 
  Lastly, we believe that, by virtue of being a model of 
international cooperation and by enhancing the region's 
strengths through collective endeavour, this Southeast Asian 
community should also strive to be a building block towards a 
global community. In this way it becomes a central actor on the 
global political and economic stage. 
  In the past, military might determined the destiny of 
nations. Increasingly, international influence is and will be 
founded upon other factors, most notably, economic and 
technological dynamism, qualities of national resilience and 
moral leadership, and demonstration of the ability to achieve 
peace and security through amity and consensus-building. 
  We firmly believe that the time has come to articulate and 
pursue this vision of Southeast Asia, for the rapid and 
far-reaching changes which have been taking place since the end 
of the Cold War offer us a unique opportunity to shape our own 
destiny as the 21st century approaches. 
  To realise this vision of Southeast Asia, there are a number 
of principles which we believe to be imperative. 
  The first principle is national and regional resilience. By 
this we mean that need to develop and rely upon individual and 
collective capacity to mobilise the full potential of our human 
and natural resources, while seeking ways of minimising our 
shortcomings and limitations. 
  The second is unity in diversity. This means a recognition 
not only of the differences that divide us, but also of the need 
and capacity for reconciling and transcending those differences 
through processes of building trust and consensus. 
  The third is the principle of common national interests. 
This means a recognition that, while there are certain 
opportunities and challenges which are of direct, and sometimes 
critical, concern to individual states, these can be best taken 
advantage of and coped with through collective efforts. These 
opportunities include trade, investment, and human and natural 
resource development, and the challenges consist of such 
problems as the environment, narcotics, illegal movement of 
people, piracy and the spread of disease. 
  The fourth is open regionalism. This means a recognition 
that, while we wish to build a stronger and more cohesive 
community, there is also the need to be outward-looking, to look 
beyond Southeast Asia, and to continue to strengthen political, 
economic, and cultural ties -- be they bilateral or multilateral 
-- with countries outside the region. 
<H5>  Strategy for community-building </H5>
  To become such a community, Southeast Asia must adopt a 
multi-dimensional strategy. 
  In the political and security dimension, we should: 
  -- strengthen the network of bilateral relations among 
Southeast Asian states, 
  -- strengthen and expand ASEAN membership to include all 
regional states, 
  -- extend accession to the 1976 Treaty of Amity and 
Cooperation to all regional states, 
  -- encourage all Southeast Asian states to participate in 
ASEAN-sponsored or -initiated forums, including the ASEAN 
Regional Forum, as mechanisms for region-wide dialogues in 
political security matters, and 
  -- convene regular consultations among all Southeast Asian 
leaders, to strengthen the habit of cooperation and to set the 
direction and pace of community-building. 
  In the economic and technological dimension, we should: 
  -- accelerate the full implementation of the AFTA [ASEAN 
Free 
Trade Area] and CEPT [Common Effective Preferential Tariff] 
agreements by the year 2000, 
  -- prepare and initiate the phased integration of other 
Southeast Asian states into AFTA and CEPT, 
  -- promote collaboration in research, development, and 
distribution of alternative energy resources, as well as the 
management of other natural resources of regional value, 
  -- set up regional mechanisms to study and recommend ways of 
stimulating intra-regional investment, development of technology 
and human resources, as well as transnational flows of 
information and knowledge, and 
  -- extend the ASEAN Business Forum to other Southeast Asian 
states. 
  In the social and cultural dimension, we should: 
  -- take immediate steps to facilitate and expand 
people-to-people contacts and exchanges, 
  -- harmonise immigration laws and procedures, 
  -- upgrade intra-regional communication and 
telecommunication 
systems, 
  -- expand exchange programmes for students and civil 
servants, 
  -- establish Southeast Asian press and information networks, 
  -- promote Southeast Asian studies and languages in 
educational institutions, 
  -- establish a Southeast Asian university system, 
  -- establish a Southeast Asian Cultural Centre in each of 
the 
Southeast Asian countries, and 
  -- set up a Southeast Asian disaster relief mechanism. 
<H5>  Flagships </H5>
  To achieve this vision, a number of "flagship" projects and 
measures must be adopted immediately. 
  -- There should be a Southeast Asian Summit, which can be an 
informal meeting, to give impetus to the building of a Southeast 
Asian community. This should take place as soon as possible. 
  -- There should be a dual-track regional initiative on 
Cambodia. The first track consists of political and diplomatic 
initiatives to revitalise and consolidate the peace process. 
The second involves mobilisation of funds for social and 
economic reconstruction, which will serve to underpin the 
efficacy of the political and diplomatic moves. Such 
mobilisation can include the issuance of bonds, officially 
endorsed by Southeast Asian governments, or the establishment of 
a bank for the reconstruction of Cambodia. 
  -- Southeast Asian leaders should endorse the ASEAN 
initiative on the South China Sea and immediately undertake 
concrete projects of cooperation for confidence-building among 
the states concerned. 
  -- A series of meetings at ministerial and senior official 
levels should be urgently convened to develop mechanisms for 
resolving the various boundary problems, including illegal 
movement of people, narcotics, smuggling, piracy, the spread of 
contagious diseases, natural resource management and 
environmental conservation. 
  -- A series of meetings at ministerial and senior official 
levels should be urgently convened to increase and expand 
economic and technical cooperation among all Southeast Asian 
countries. The main emphasis in the initial stages should be on 
trade, investment and human resource development. 
  -- Southeast Asia should immediately undertake the 
development of alternative renewable energy resources, such as 
rip-tide and deuterium, to be shared by the region. 
  -- Southeast Asia should immediately demonstrate its 
commitment to support projects aimed at harnessing and equitably 
utilising the resources of the Mekong River and its tributaries. 
This commitment will serve to promote and underline the sense 
of regional identity, as well as to encourage a development 
which is likely to benefit the region as a whole. 
  -- Southeast Asia should immediately establish a "Southeast 
Asian Development Corps." This will offer opportunities, 
especially to the young, to learn about other countries' 
problems and their solutions at first hand, and foster a sense 
of regional identity. 
  -- At the 1995 ASEAN Summit in Bangkok, the ASEAN leaders 
should collectively support this vision of a Southeast Asian 
community. 
  We invite all peoples and nations of our region to share in 
this vision and collectively work towards the realisation of a 
peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
reassured U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday [14 Jun] of 
Japan's resolve to support possible UN sanctions against North 
Korea, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  "If a resolution is adopted, we will take responsible action 
within the bounds of our constitution," the premier was quoted 
as saying in a telephone talk with Clinton. 
  He was referring to a possible UN resolution calling for 
sanctions against Pyongyang because it refuses to allow further 
inspections of its nuclear facilities, suspected of being used 
in a push to develop nuclear weapons. 
  During the 20-minute conversation, Clinton said the U.S. 
perceives the North Korean nuclear issue as posing problems for 
nuclear nonproliferation and global security, the official said. 
  The U.S. President also spoke of the need for the United 
States, Japan and South Korea to take a united front in 
persuading Pyongyang to allay international concerns over its 
suspected nuclear program. 
  Clinton voiced grave concern over North Korea's reported 
decision to immediately withdraw from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), adding the international community should 
keep an eye on any move by the communist nation, the official 
said. 
  North Korea said Monday it will immediately withdraw from 
the 
IAEA over the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog's "unreasonable 
sanctions" and its attempt "to intrude even into our military 
sites." 
  Noting China has to play a key role in encouraging North 
Korea to clear its suspicions on its nuclear program, Hata said 
Japan will keep in close touch and cooperate with the U.S. in 
pursuit of resolution of the issue. 
  The premier also said he shares with Clinton the view that 
the UN Security Council is nearing the stage of deciding on 
appropriate steps, including sanctions, in dealing with North 
Korea, the official said. 
  Hata denied Tokyo's reported reluctance to levy sanctions on 
Pyongyang, saying it is way off the mark. 
  Asked to comment on Russia's proposal to call an eight-party 
international conference to resolve the nuclear fray on the 
Korean peninsula, Japan's chief executive responded he evaluates 
highly Moscow's efforts but noted the Security Council's move 
should not be affected by such a gathering. 
  While showing understanding of Hata's view, Clinton said the 
U.S. will seek to cooperate with Russia on the matter, the 
official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher agreed 
Tuesday that North Korea's decision to quit the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a matter of deep concern, 
officials said. 
  Kakizawa and Christopher also agreed over the phone that 
Pyongyang's decision to leave the IAEA and reject further 
inspections of its nuclear facilities is an internationally 
unacceptable act, the Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  They agreed to maintain close contact on the problem. 
  Pyongyang's action runs counter to international demands to 
abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements and its refusal of 
further inspections may make matters worse, the officials quoted 
Kakizawa as saying. 
  Christopher also voiced serious concern and indicated that 
the United States may review its stance in the UN discussions on 
the North Korean situation, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa, who visited South Korea and China over the 
weekend, 
told Christopher he held frank discussions with South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the 
North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  The Foreign Minister said he agreed with the South Korean 
leaders to maintain bilateral coordination on the issue and to 
seek gradual sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  China is also seriously concerned about the situation, 
Kakizawa said. He told Christopher that he urged China to 
continue to try to persuade North Korea to change its stance. 
The minister said he also asked China to play a positive role 
in the UN Security Council regarding the problem. 
  Kakizawa quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as 
saying Beijing wants to play a constructive role in solving the 
North Korean nuclear dispute, the officials said. 
  Christopher said he will closely watch China's moves. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai quoted 
Kakizawa as telling Christopher that Japan intends to cope 
calmly with the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  The top government spokesman also told a press conference 
that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will talk to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton over the telephone, possibly later Tuesday. 
  The premier will seek to have a "frank" talk with Clinton, 
Kumagai said. 
  Earlier in the day, Hata expressed regret over North Korea's 
reported decision. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a 
statement 
Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its 
decision. 
  In Washington, the White House said Clinton talked with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about an 
international conference on North Korea. 
  Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim in Moscow on June 2 
that Russia, the U.S., Japan, China, the United Nations and the 
IAEA should join North and South Korea in holding a conference 
to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
  At the UN in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright 
told reporters the U.S. will submit a sanctions resolution to 
the UN Security Council in the next couple of days.

  In a related development, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked over the phone

government sources said. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a

Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its 
decision to leave the IAEA and reject further inspections of its 
nuclear facilities, as reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL 
NEWS AGENCY on Monday night. 
  The spokesman said in the statement that the North Korean 
action runs counter to the international community's calls for 
Pyongyang to abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements. 
  The Japanese reaction to the North Korean announcement came 
as other world leaders were busy exploring steps to deal with 
the looming crisis on the Korean peninsula. 
  In Washington, the White House said President Bill Clinton 
talked with Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about 
an international conference on North Korea. 
  Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow

  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed his serious 
regrets at the House of Councillors' Budget Committee this 
morning on North Korea's (the DPRK's) announcement of its 
withdrawal from the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). 
He indicated that he would continue to persist in persuading 
North Korea to agree to hold dialogue with the international 
community. 
  [Begin Hata recording] With regard to the withdrawal from 
IAEA, it is indeed unfortunate. However, this still does not 
mean withdrawal from the nuclear NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. 
In the circumstances, we still hold hopes that they [the North 
Koreans] will open their doors to the international community as 
soon as possible to eliminate suspicions about their development 
of nuclear weapons. [end recording] 
  Hata thus indicated his intention to persist in persuading 
North Korea to engage in dialogue with the international 
community.

  [Text] Japanese Foreign Ministry analysts believe that 
North Korea is taking a tough stand in an attempt to win some 
kind of compromise to prevent United Nations' sanctions. Japan 
-- without responding excessively to North Korea's announcement 
to secede from the IAEA, and by maintaining ties with the United 
States, the ROK, and China -- wants to strengthen its effort to 
persuade North Korea to sit down at the discussion table with 
the international community.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- North Korea accused Japan 
on Tuesday of preparing to dispatch Self Defense Force (SDF) 
troops to the Korean Peninsula under the guise of "collective 
security measures" according to a report from Pyongyang 
monitored in Tokyo. 
  The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) dispatch said that an 
analyst for NODONG SINMUN, the Korean Workers' Party newspaper, 
accused Japan of zealously joining the United States in its 
efforts to force North Korea to agree to international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The analyst warned that if international sanctions were 
imposed on North Korea, Japan would dispatch SDF personnel to 
the Korean peninsula. "This indicates Japan's hostile policy 
(toward North Korea) is reaching the extreme," the analyst said. 
  The KCNA report was monitored by the Korea News Service, a 
Tokyo-based agency watching developments on the peninsula.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- North Korea told a 
delegation from Japan's Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ] that the country is not trying to develop nuclear 
weapons, SDPJ officials said Tuesday. 
  Hwang Chang-yop, the Korean Worker's Party's secretary in 
charge of international affairs, told the visiting delegation of 
SDPJ legislators in Pyongyang that "North Korea will not have 
nuclear bombs" and has neither the technology nor funds for such 
a purpose. 
  SDPJ officials in Tokyo said the legislators headed by House 
of Representatives member Kazo Watanabe held talks with North 
Korean officials in Pyongyang on Monday. 
  Watanabe reportedly conveyed a message from Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata to the effect that resolution of the nuclear row 
through dialogue will help improve relations between Japan and 
North Korea. The two countries have no diplomatic relations. 
  Hwang's remarks echo comments by North Korean President Kim 
Il-song in the fall of 1990 to a joint delegation of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) and SDPJ members. 
  The SDPJ delegation entered the North Korean capital via 
Beijing on Saturday and held talks with ruling party officials, 
including Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the reunification policy 
committee, over the nuclear problems and bilateral issues. 
  The delegation is returning home Tuesday by way of Beijing. 
  The SDPJ, Japan's second largest opposition party, has 
traditionally maintained close relations with North Korea, which 
is suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons development program.

  [Text] Osaka, June 13 KYODO -- The Pacific Resource 
Exchange Center, a government-backed agency, will dispatch its 
officials to Vietnam to lecture on corporate management and 
other issues, center officials said Monday [13 Jun]. 
  The lecture, to be held June 14-24 in Ho Chi Minh city and 
Hanoi, is designed to help Vietnam smoothly shift to a market 
economy under its "doi moi" reform policy. 
  The economic reform has engendered a number of problems, 
such 
as a widening gap in the living standards between big cities and 
other areas and deteriorating health of state-run enterprises. 
  The planned lecture will focus on ways to nurture and 
strengthen managerially weak small firms and breathe new life 
into economically backward local areas.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Mitsui and Co., Japan's 
giant trading house, will look into the possibility of a 400 
million dollar liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) project in Vietnam 
in conjunction with three foreign partners, a Mitsui official 
said Friday [10 June]. 
  The three other parties involved are Vietnam's public oil 
company PetroVietnam, British Gas PLC and TransCanada Pipelines 
Ltd., the official said. 
  Depending on the result of a feasibility study to be 
conducted soon, the parties involved in the project will set up 
a joint concern as early as this year to explore natural gas 
flowing out of an oil field off the southern Vietnamese coast. 
  The project calls for laying a 130-kilometer pipeline 
linking 
the oil field with an LPG plant in Vung Tau, southeast of Ho Chi 
Minh City. 
  Production is slated to begin in the latter half of 1996 at 
the earliest, with annual production of some 260,000 tons 
intended for export to Japan, China and Southeast Asia as well 
as for use at local power plants, the official added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Friday submitted to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) a 
statement calling the use of nuclear arms "contrary to the 
spirit of humanity." 
  But the statement of the government's view on the legality 
of 
using nuclear weapons in armed conflict was stripped of a phrase 
included in an earlier draft which had denied such use 
constitutes a violation of international law. 
  The ICJ or so-called World Court had called on U.N. members 
to submit "advisory opinions" on the legality of using nuclear 
weapons after the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 1993 
requested the court to decide whether or not nuclear warfare 
violates international law. 
  The government received a request from the ICJ last 
September 
to submit its written statement by Friday. 
  "The government believes that because of the immense power 
to 
cause destruction, death and injury to human beings, the use of 
nuclear weapons is clearly contrary to the spirit of humanity 
that gives international law its philosophical foundation," the 
Japanese statement said. 
  "Japan, the only nation that has suffered nuclear attack, 
considers that nuclear weapons must never be used," the 
statement said, according to Foreign Ministry officials. 
  It further noted that the government "firmly maintains" the 
country's three nonnuclear principles -- not possessing, not 
producing and not introducing nuclear weapons into Japanese 
territory. 
  Japan, it said, "will always strive to promote nuclear 
disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation with a view to 
achieving the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons." 
  The government had intended to submit a paper which said the 
use of nuclear arms technically does not violate international 
law but decided to delete the phrase after strong criticism from 
opposition parties and from victims of the atomic bombings of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa was quoted as telling the 
mayors of the two cities in a meeting Thursday that "It is 
difficult to affirm (the use of nuclear arms is) a complete 
violation when thinking about the reality of international 
politics." 
  The dispute was further aggravated by timing as the standoff 
over North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons is at 
a highly sensitive stage with the possibility of U.N. sanctions 
looming.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Japan and the European 
Union (EU) on Tuesday [14 June] agreed to cooperate further in 
enhancing each other's industrial foundation, Japanese Trade 
Ministry officials said. 
  At the end of the second "Japan-EU Industrial Policy and 
Cooperation Dialogue" in Tokyo, Japan's Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the European 
Commission issued a joint statement calling for industrial 
cooperation not only in existing areas such as electric home 
appliances but in new sectors like computers, auto parts and 
office equipment, the officials said. 
  The statement said both parties will also support dialogue 
between Japanese and EU business leaders to be held by the end 
of this year under the newly established "roundtable." Under 
the manufacturing technology fellowship program, young European 
engineers will be invited to work in Japanese plants for up to 
one year, the statement said. 
  The MITI officials said Japan and the EU confirmed the 
importance of further action in existing cooperative areas, 
among them the training of European engineers through the 
Industrial Cooperation Center (ICC). The ICC was created in 
Tokyo in 1987 as a way to get European companies accustomed to 
Japanese business practices and market conditions. 
  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international 
affairs, led a Japanese team at Tuesday's meeting while the 
European side was headed by Riccardo Perissich, chief of the 
European Commission's Industry Bureau [name and title as 
received].

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Plans for the first ever 
exchange of Japanese and South Korean naval training squadrons 
are moving forward, Defense Agency sources said Tuesday [14 Jun]. 
  The two countries are working out the schedule, ports of 
call 
and other details for the exchange between Japan's Maritime 
Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and the South Korean Navy [SKN], the 
sources said. 
  Former Defense Agency Chief Kazuo Aichi and South Korean 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae agreed during Yi's visit to Japan 
in April that the exchange would be one link in realizing 
broader military exchanges. 
  Progress on the exchange comes as Japanese and South Korean 
vessels are taking part for the first time together in the 
six-nation RIMPAC naval exercises near Hawaii and as concern 
over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program continues to 
mount on the Korean peninsula. 
  According to the agency sources, South Korea proposed the 
mutual exchange immediately after Yi returned to South Korea 
from Japan. A South Korean squadron will visit Japan followed 
by a return visit by a Japanese squadron to a South Korean port. 
  Japanese officials say that "fundamentally there are no 
obstacles" for the exchange but add the situation in North Korea 
could alter the plans. 
  Young officers in the MSDF training squadron have just 
recently completed their land-based training and have visited 
different parts of the world every year for their training at 
sea. 
  In the Asia-Pacific region, the officer trainees have 
visited 
the Philippines and Guam but have yet to make a port call in 
South Korea. 
  In the past, South Korea has suggested that its submarine 
personnel train on Japanese submarines, but the Defense Agency 
has never taken any action. 
  In its 1992-93 white paper on defense, South Korea called 
for 
broader military exchanges with Japan as a contribution to the 
reunification of the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan will extend emergency 
aid totaling 9 million dollars to international organizations to 
help the victims of the conflict in Rwanda, the Foreign Ministry 
said Friday [10 June]. 
  The aid consists of 6.45 million dollars to the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, 2.4 million dollars to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and 150,000 dollars to 
the World Health Organization, the ministry said. 
  The conflict in Rwanda has been expanding and intensifying 
since disputes erupted between government and anti-government 
troops in early April. The ministry quoted UN sources as saying 
more than 500,000 people have died as a result of the fighting 
and massacres, while about 3 million people have either left 
their homes or fled to Tanzania, Burundi, Zaire and Uganda. 
  But despite efforts by humanitarian organizations, the 
victims of the conflict are in disastrous condition because of 
the lack of food, drinking water and medical goods, the ministry 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
plans to offer an explicit apology to nations victimized by 
Japan's war conduct next year when Japan commemorates the 50th 
anniversary of its surrender in World War II, a top government 
official said. 
  "Prime Minister Hata is considering putting an end to a fray 
to alleviate all the troubles (surrounding Japan's war 
reparation) by taking the opportunity on the 50th anniversary of 
the end of World War II," the official said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  Hata plans to resolve controversies involving redress for 
former "comfort women," who were forced into prostitution by 
Japan's Imperial Army before and during World War II, and 
Japan's confiscation of postal savings of Taiwanese citizens 
then under Japanese rule, he said. 
  Unpaid money that includes the postal savings deposited by 
Taiwanese before and during World War II total 452.4 million 
yen, according to a government estimate. 
  In a related development, Hata became the first Japanese 
prime minister to meet with Korean and Philippine comfort women 
Thursday [9 June]. The unofficial meeting was arranged in a 
Diet corridor. 
  Hata also wants to arrange for a Diet resolution that Japan 
will not invade other countries again and for various official 
projects and ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary, he 
said. 
  However, Japan remains reluctant to make any individual 
reparation payments or to take "actions that could be a 
substitute for the reparation," the official said.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese in its "Sunday Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) program at 
0000 GMT on 12 June begins broadcasting a live, 60-minute 
roundtable discussion on the current political situation in 
Japan. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoto. Participating in the discussions are Kozo Watanabe, 
acting Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general, and 
Kansei Nakano, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP), who are at the NHK studio. They are joined by 
Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan (SDPJ), and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), who are linked to the studio via remote 
hookup. 
  Prior to the discussion, the program briefly describes the 
current, unstable political situation with the current Diet 
session scheduled to adjourn late in June. At 0230 GMT, 
Yamamoto asks Mori whether the LDP still plans to submit a 
no-confidence motion against the administration of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. Mori says that the plan has not been 
changed and stresses that the minority government of Prime 
Minister Hata should hand over power to the LDP. He states: 
"With the passage of the FY 1994 budget, the Hata administration 
has finished serving its purpose." 
  In response, Watanabe says that sensible members of the LDP 
and the SDPJ do not really favor Hata's immediate resignation 
and that "should the LDP persist in submitting the no-confidence 
motion for no due reason, the SDPJ, as well as the general 
public, would oppose it." 
  When asked what he feels about the LDP asking that power be 
turned over because Hata currently leads a minority government, 
Nakano replies that even though a minority government is not a 
normal situation, "it is not sufficient reason to propose a no- 
confidence motion." 
  Asked how he feels about the same matter, Kubo answers: 
"There must be a good reason for a no-confidence motion. It is 
also irresponsible to turn out a government without the next 
administration that will replace it having a sound plan about 
what it intends to do." He emphasizes that the party has no 
intention of submitting a no-confidence motion right away. 
  As for the possibility of the SDPJ's returning to the 
coalition, Kubo says that the party does not intend to return to 
the coalition right away and that it is only considering that 
possibility by holding further policy consultations -- not from 
the point where the party left the coalition immediately 
following the formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group but 
rather back when the coalition parties drew up policy accords on 
22 April. 
  Asked to comment on Kubo's remarks, Watanabe states that it 
is necessary for the SDPJ to return to the coalition. 
  Nakano agrees and says that the DSP will do its part to try 
to convince the SDPJ to return to the coalition. 
  Mori says that although it is up to the SDPJ to decide 
whether to return to the coalition, all the parties concerned 
should look back at what caused the SDPJ to leave the coalition, 
and he states that power should be turned over to the LDP 
because both Prime Minister Hata and former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa have advocated creating a political structure 
under which political forces can take turns ruling whenever this 
is appropriate. 
  Watanabe says that the LDP can naturally return to power if 
it can win a majority of seats in the next general election that 
would be held under a new electoral system. He urges the LDP to 
support the Hata administration for the time being because the 
economy finally seems to be headed for a recovery and because 
there is the current need to deal with the DPRK nuclear issue. 
Watanabe adds that the LDP should then take on the coalition in 
a general election after these problems have been solved. 
  Mori notes that the LDP has already offered the coalition 
sufficient cooperation. 
  Asked whether the SDPJ plans to propose a no-confidence 
motion if the Hata administration fails to resign voluntarily, 
Kubo answers that the party is not out to topple the 
administration just for the sake of toppling it but rather that 
the party is prepared to offer its full cooperation toward 
forming a new coalition government. He adds that a general 
election following the dissolution of the Diet is an option. 
  The discussion then continues on the issue of the SDPJ's 
possible return to the coalition. 
  At 0027 GMT, Kubo explains topics on which agreement needs 
to 
be reached between the SDPJ and the coalition parties as a 
condition for the SDPJ's return to the coalition. Nakano 
emphasizes the importance of thorough discussions toward this 
end, and Watanabe reiterates this. 
  Concerning possible policy consultations between the LDP and 
the SDPJ, Mori says that under the current conditions, it would 
be difficult for the two parties to hold concrete consultations. 
  At 0039 GMT, Yamamoto asks Kubo about the SDPJ's view 
regarding the consumption tax. Kubo replies that the government 
should make greater efforts to make the people understand the 
need for a consumption tax increase, rather than having the 
government just say that this is necessary because of expected 
revenue shortfalls. Watanabe explains that the coalition 
government is currently working on tax reforms which fully 
consider the SDPJ's suggestions. 
  Asked about the situation within the LDP on the issue of 
submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata 
administration, Mori denies that the party is divided over this 
issue, saying: "When I spoke to Mr. [Toshiki] Kaifu the other 
day, he said that his intentions were not necessarily being 
conveyed accurately. Mr. [Hiroshi] Mitsuzuka said that the 
party should not submit a no- confidence motion while knowing 
that it will be defeated. Of course, it goes without saying 
that the party needs to listen to such opinions from both within 
and outside the party." 
  At 0048 GMT, Yamamoto shows an illustration which portrays 
the courses of action if a no-confidence motion were to be 
submitted and what might happen if the motion were not 
submitted. Discussions continue on the issues of a 
no-confidence motion, a dissolution of the Diet, and the next 
general election. 
  After lengthy discussions, the program ends at 0100 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman 
of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), called 
Tuesday [14 Jun] on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for his 
cabinet's leadership in implementing deregulation and other 
administrative reform, officials said. 
  "The cabinet should break the wall of vested interests and 
lead administrative reforms decisively," Toyoda told Hata in a 
meeting at the prime minister's official residence. 
  Toyoda and Keidanren's Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi asked 
Hata 
to set a target to halve the number of economic regulations in 
five years. 
  He also called on Hata to map out a plan for scrapping and 
privatizing government-backed corporations. 
  Hata responded that the reforms and deregulations are a 
national problem which must be tackled. 
  At the day's cabinet meeting, Hata instructed ministers to 
display leadership in their ministries and agencies in compiling 
deregulation measures by the end of the month.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- A revised insurance law to 
allow insurance brokers to operate in Japan will require such 
brokers to have the ability to meet claims arising from the 
products they sell, finance ministry sources said Saturday (11 
June). 
  Other points in a draft of the revised insurance law are a 
ban on insurance companies acting as brokers and a requirement 
that brokers give the best advice possible when signing up 
customers for insurance products, the sources said. 
  Insurance brokers sell insurance products on behalf of 
insurance companies. The brokerage system is widespread in the 
United States but in Japan insurance companies sell their own 
products directly. 
  In bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the US is 
demanding that insurance brokers be allowed in Japan as the 
Insurance Council, an advisory panel to the finance minister, 
proposed two years ago. 
  Under the revised law, insurance brokers will be licensed 
through an exam to be conducted by an association of such 
brokers to be set up under the jurisdiction of the Finance 
Ministry. 
  The law will authorize the ministry to inspect brokers and 
to 
cancel the license of any broker found guilty of wrongdoing. 
  Insurance industry officials say introduction of brokers 
could lead to a major shakeout in the insurance industry, 
causing insurance firms to compete against each other on the 
strength of their products rather than on the ability of their 
sales staffs. 
  The Insurance Council is slated to hold a hearing Tuesday to 
obtain the view of foreign insurance companies on how to revise 
the insurance law. 
  The Finance Ministry is now working on revising the law and 
the revision is expected to take place in fiscal 1996 at the 
earliest.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The head of the powerful 
Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) expressed 
support Monday [13 June] for the planned abolition of a 
provisional law regulating imports of oil products. 
  It is natural to abolish the law in line with economic 
deregulation, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the elite business 
club, told a news conference, referring to a plan by the Trade 
Ministry to abolish the law. 
  He said deregulation is a major task to be tackled and 
should 
be pushed ahead by all means. 
  Toyoda, who is chairman of Japan's top automaker Toyota 
Motor 
Corp., said he was not confident enough on an economic recovery 
although there were some bright signs. 
  He said the present value of the Japanese yen is too high in 
view of Japan's fundamental economic conditions and it should be 
brought down to an optimum level, or around 110 yen to the 
dollar.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- A subcommittee of the 
Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the international trade 
and industry minister, will soon propose the liberalization of 
imports of gasoline, kerosene and gas oil, panel sources said 
Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The plan is contained in a draft of the subcommittee's 
interim report, which will be officially finalized on June 20, 
the sources said. 
  Under a current oil products import law, only oil refiners 
can import such oil products. The report, however, will propose 
the law be scrapped in March 1996, they said. 
  Instead, the report will call for the government to 
introduce 
a new law to liberalize imports of petroleum products with some 
limitations. 
  The import liberalization will allow trading firms having no 
oil refining facilities to import petroleum products to help the 
government promote deregulation of the petroleum industry. 
  When the interim report is officially adopted, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry and the Agency of Natural 
Resources and Energy will begin drafting a new law with the aim 
of it being enacted at an ordinary Diet session next year, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry 
will introduce a system to consider technical standards, as well 
as the bidding price, in choosing successful bidders for public 
works contracts, ministry officials said Monday [13 June]. 
  They said the new system is to apply on an experimental 
basis 
to ministry-controlled public works projects, beginning fiscal 
1994, which started April 1. 
  The present system, which awards a public works contract to 
the lowest bidder, contributes to bid rigging and unfair price 
competition, critics say. 
  The new system gives overall numerical ratings to bidders, 
including noise and vibration control measures and designing, in 
addition to the bidding price, the officials said. 
  The government had earlier used a bid evaluation system 
based 
on technical standards and cost in choosing successful bidders 
for supercomputer supply contracts.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A government panel has 
drafted an ambitious space development blueprint that foresees 
manned outposts on the Moon within three decades and calls for 
sending artists and intellectuals as well as space specialists 
into space, panel sources said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  The new grand design for Japan's space program will be 
included in a report to be announced as early as July by the 
Space Activities Commission's task force responsible for drawing 
up the nation's long-term space policy outline, the sources said. 
  The report will illustrate Japan's emboldened posture in 
space development after the February success in launching the 
H-2 rocket, the first large rocket built solely with domestic 
technology, they said. The proposals will be incorporated into 
the government's space development platform which is expected to 
be revised for the first time in five years. The report 
stipulates two groups of targets for space development projects, 
to be achieved in 15 years and in 30 years, respectively. 
  The commission has fashioned a 15-year plan for bringing 
back 
rocks and ice from Mercury and other small planets and also for 
geological research on Mars and the Moon using surface rovers. 
After 30 years, Japan should have completed, with international 
cooperation if possible, a manned station and an astronomical 
observatory on the Moon, the report says. 
  For fostering the necessary technology for such a grandiose 
project, the report proposes active participation in the 
U.S.-inspired international space station program, expected to 
be completed in early 21st century. It also stresses the 
importance of sending nonexperts like intellectuals and artists 
to the planned space station to make space activities more 
familiar to the public. 
  The report cites probes on the Moon and the use of solar 
energy in space as principal new space ventures that Japan 
should embark on. For the lunar probes, observations of the 
Moon surface by satellites and the bringing of Moon soil back to 
the earth are envisaged as goals to be achieved within 15 years. 
Japan should play an active part in any international projects 
for building Moon stations, it says. 
  As for the transportation technology demanded by the 
project, 
the report calls for development of a spruced-up version of the 
H-2 rocket that is twice as powerful as the current model within 
10 years as a means to launch Japan's own unmanned space 
shuttles. The space shuttles (Hope, or H-2 orbiting plane) 
should be augmented for manned missions within 30 years, the 
report says.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) on Tuesday [14 June] 
underscored the importance of Japan beefing up its 
"techno-infrastructure" in a guideline for research and 
development of industrial and scientific technology. 
  The government should "drastically" expand budgetary 
appropriations for reinforcing Japan's overall technological 
foundation in line with the guideline, a MITI official told a 
press conference. The official said the level of a country's 
techno- infrastructure can be enhanced by improvements in 
various factors, such as human resources, information, facility 
construction, fund raising, protection of intellectual property 
rights and the deregulation of research activity. 
  Japan's technological standards should be raised through 
active research activity, not only by specialized organs like 
MITI institutes but also by private-sector research entities, 
the official said. The public sector should devote itself to 
improving the general research environment for private organs 
and universities, the official said. 
  The guideline cited nine major industrial and scientific 
sectors as areas of priority study. Among them are new 
materials, biotechnology, space technology, medical equipment, 
clean energy development, new resources and information and 
communications.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- A high-quality video phone 
system will be in general use by about 2030 enabling people to 
talk across the world as if they were conversing face to face, a 
government report said Friday [10 June]. 
  The system would be capable of two-way high-quality moving 
image and voice transmission, said the 1994 white paper on 
communications released by the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. The report also predicted that 
three-dimensional image communications would be possible also by 
about 2030. 
  In the industry and business fields, the ministry forecast 
that producers and consumers would be linked directly through an 
information network, making the distribution process unnecessary. 
  The report also predicted that electronic newspapers would 
make their debuts, diversifying the means of acquiring 
information and revolutionizing the mass media. 
  The ministry also said "tele-educational" and "tele-medical" 
systems would spread, bringing about a major change in the field 
of education, medical treatment and administration. The 
ministry also prepared a CD-ROM (compact disk-read only memory) 
version of the white paper, the first of its kind in Japan. The 
CD-ROM version will be offered for rent by anyone up to a month 
without charge, starting in July.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
cut the base rate on lending to government affiliates by 0.20 
percentage point to an annual 4.10 percent, effective Friday [17 
Jun], ministry said Monday. 
  The move reflected recent declines in the coupon on 
long-term 
government bonds, the officials said. 
  Given the rate reduction, the ministry will consult with the 
Construction Ministry to decide on new rates on public loans 
extended by Housing Loan Corp. 
  The new base rate, for example, on loans for purchasing 
newly 
built housing with floor space of up to 125 square meters, is 
expected to go down by 0.15 percentage point to an annual 3.90 
percent, effective the same day. 
  The base rates on public housing loans link with those on 
lending by Finance Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau by using funds 
of the fiscal investment and loan program. 
  The current housing loan rates of 4.05 percent were set on 
April 22 after a round of rate hikes from an all-time low of 
3.60 percent marked on Jan. 26.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
called for lower domestic prices Monday [13 Jun], saying the gap 
between prices in Japan and overseas should be narrowed. 
  "To make our lives richer, we have to directly address the 
issue of rectifying the gap between domestic and overseas 
prices," he told a private advisory panel, urging it to come up 
with specific recommendations for that purpose. 
  It is the 13th meeting for the panel, an advisory body on 
prices to the prime minister. 
  The panel has 44 members, including economic experts and 
people in the industrial, labor, and consumer fields chosen to 
give their opinions on bringing down Japan's prices to 
international levels. 
  Sources close to the panel say it remains to be seen what 
specific measures it will be able to recommend, since policies 
so far have been unable to tug domestic prices lower despite the 
appreciation of the yen. 
  The panel is likely to base its discussions on a report 
compiled by a research committee that was set up last fall. 
  Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa 
and 
other cabinet members also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan should improve its 
systems of disclosure and performance assessment for securities 
investment trusts to protect investors and implement 
self-responsibility principles, a Finance Ministry study group 
said Friday [10 June] in a draft report. 
  The advisory panel to the chief of the ministry's securities 
bureau discussed the draft report at a meeting Friday and asked 
for minor changes and the issuance of a final report as early as 
June 22, a ministry official said. 
  The official, requesting anonymity, said the draft prepared 
by the ministry group aims at "investor protection and 
self-responsibility principles," and points out that the current 
law enacted in 1951 has failed to "sufficiently" meet changes in 
market environment. 
  Disclosure covers details of investment and portfolio 
strategies and periodic reports on performance to meet 
complaints that the current system is "insufficient" for 
investor understanding, the official said. 
  As for investment performance, the report calls for a 
"benchmark" to facilitate investor understanding and to spur 
competition among trust firms that manage funds and among 
securities firms that sell such funds to investors. 
  The report also seeks a review of the current law and 
adoption of "fair-trading" rules to revive the functions of 
investment trusts that are not at present working, to maintain 
stability and to vitalize market activities. 
  The group has been discussing the reform of Japan's 
investment trust business since last November amid waning 
investor interest in trusts after the collapse of the "bubble" 
speculation boom in the late 1980s. 
  With stock prices tumbling, investors faced the prospect of 
their stock investment funds falling below their initial values 
and various problems surfaced such as complaints that brokerage 
houses had failed to make clear to investors that they could 
also lose money. 
  The official said the report makes it clear that the panel 
remains mixed on many other issues, including the adoption of 
U.S.- style mutual funds.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry plans 
to liberalize interest rates on housing loans charged by 
commercial banks in July at the earliest, ministry sources said 
Monday [13 June]. 
  The sources said the decontrol will be incorporated in an 
economic deregulation package to be worked out by the government 
at the end of June. 
  They said banks would be accused of violating the 
antimonopoly law if they manipulate interest rates on housing 
loans through behind-the-scenes negotiations. 
  Fixed and variable interest rates on housing loans, 
introduced in 1983, have been linked to movements of the 
long-term prime lending rate charged by commercial banks on 
loans to creditworthy customers. 
  The sources said commercial banks are studying the 
possibility of linking housing loan interest with the short-term 
prime rate, which reflects interest movements on the money 
market.

  [Text] Fukuoka, June 11 KYODO -- The computer microchip 
industry in Kyushu, known as Japan's Silicon Valley, is 
regaining vitality on the strength of brisk exports, Trade 
Ministry officials said Saturday [11 June]. 
  According to the Kyushu Regional Bureau of International 
Trade and Industry, total production of integrated circuits 
(ICs) in the Kyushu region in April hit a record high of about 
670.6 million chips. 
  April marked the 15th consecutive month of year-to-year 
rises, said the regional bureau of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI). 
  An official of major microchip manufacturer Oki Electric 
Industry Co.'s semiconductor factory in Miyazaki Prefecture said 
the record- breaking output reflects "strong exports to the 
United States due to robust demand for personal computers there." 
  "A great number of microchip makers are building new 
facilities to boost production capacities," he said. 
  In 1992, ic output in Kyushu plunged 11 percent from the 
year 
before to 6.36 billion chips. 
  Production began to show signs of picking up early this 
year. 
In February, the first year-on-year rise in about two years was 
seen. 
  IC production surged to 668,637,000 chips the following 
month, the highest level since the 670 million scored in 
September 1993.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) on Monday [13 Jun] called for the 
government to take all kinds of measures to put the Japanese 
economy on a steady recovery track, a trade ministry official 
said. 
  Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda and other senior Keidanren 
executives made the request during a breakfast meeting with 
high-ranking officials at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI), including Eijiro Hata, the trade minister. 
  The fiscal 1994 national budget should be enacted at the 
earliest possible time, while tax reform and deregulation 
packages should be worked out by the end of this month, Toyoda 
was quoted as saying by the MITI official. 
  Yutaka Kume, Keidanren's vice chairman, asked for the 
corporate tax burden be eased and a landholding tax to be 
abolished, to spur overall corporate activity in Japan. 
  Kume, chairman of Nissan Motor Co., also proposed the 
government support research activity at universities and 
national institutes as part of efforts to upgrade Japan's 
industrial infrastructure, the MITI official said. 
  Hata replied that the ministry will respond to these 
requests 
"positively," the official said. 
  On the worsening of employment prospects for college 
graduates, Toyoda said Keidenren will urge business corporations 
to step up new recruitment, especially of female graduates, who 
are finding it extremely difficult to get jobs.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 9 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The official 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that at the sitting here spring 
session of the Great State Hural of Mongolia the draft law on 
pensions and allowances is being discussed. It is informed 
about the submitting by the government for consideration at the 
Mongolian parliament of the draft law on internal troops and the 
draft law on changes and amendments to be made to the law on 
administrative responsibility. 
  The newspaper informs in its permanent heading "From Dawn to 
Dusk" about the latest events and developments within the 
country. It is reported that this summer Mongolia is likely to 
be visited by about seven thousand foreign tourists under the 
schemes of the joint stock "Juulchin" company and the first 
congress of the Mongolian Democratic Party for restoration. 
  Chief engineer of the capital city's Power Plant No. 4 G. 
Yondongombo in his article published in the newspaper is 
touching upon the issues of concern relating to the regular 
supply with electricity of residents of the city during the 
winter season. One of the most sore points existing for a long 
while in power industry especially in this power plant which 
should be solved immediately are first of all low quality of 
coal and, then, the pressing need for carrying out technical 
restructuring. Specially concern is evoked in connection with 
the fact that up to now the capital repairs referring to the 
basic equipment and machinery of the power plant has not been 
begun yet. 
  The newspaper carries an interview of its correspondent with 
the former director general of the Bank for Trade and 
Development Dugersuren Giyn Suherdene who was attracted as the 
accused in reference to the scandalous case of dealers and gold 
in its heading "Frankly Speaking". 
  As far as the international affairs are concerned the 
central 
official organ informs of a visit to Mongolia of a military 
delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by 
the Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army Tsoi 
Gwan [name as received], of the opening of Trade Exhibition of 
Asia and Pacific region (ASPAT-94) held in Beijing and others. 
  The organ of the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary 
Party (MPRP) -- the newspaper "UNEN" is giving much prominence 
to the youth forum of members and supporters of the MPRP opened 
yesterday in the Mongolian capital. This forum is being held 
under the motto "The Youth and the 21st Century". The newspaper 
provides an interview of its correspondent with the secretary of 
the MPRP B. Enhmandah concerning the policy being pursued by the 
ruling party in relation to the youth. Also speeches by some 
delegates are being given. 
  The capital newspaper "ULAANBAATAR" is raising on its first 
page one of the topics of the capital life -- thefts and 
criminals. The article published in the newspaper is citing 
concrete facts and showings evidencing the growth rate in the 
criminality, in particular, thefts committed in the capital of 
Mongolia. It is only for the Ulaanbaatar city that some two 
thousand thieves are being registered officially. 
  The newspaper provides several materials timed to the 
forthcoming 355th anniversary since the foundation of the 
Ulaanbaatar city. An old resident of the city D. Damdinsuren is 
writing in his letter that only a few days are left before the 
celebrations of the 73th anniversary of the 1921 year's people's 
revolution. But the location of the "black market" nearby the 
Central Stadium where the major events relating to the national 
festivities are usually carried on is to promote impacting and 
spoiling the environment of the stadium notably garbage 
everywhere and the lawns trodden. It is high time to undertake 
on the part of the city administration some measures necessary 
for correcting such shortcomings.

  [Text] As North Korea has suddenly declared its withdrawal 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the 
government is seeking various countermeasures while analyzing 
the details of North Korea's announcement. 
  After North Korea suddenly reported its withdrawal from the 
IAEA yesterday [13 June], government officials at the National 
Unification Board and the Foreign Ministry stayed in their 
offices late at night to grasp the real intention of North Korea 
by communicating with friendly nations, such as the United 
States and Japan. They also came to their offices earlier than 
usual this morning and are trying to seek measures, anticipating 
North Korea's countermeasure against possible sanctions by the 
UN Security Council. 
  Regarding North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from 
the IAEA, a government official said: North Korea's action is 
analyzed to have double purpose, to express its dissatisfaction 
at the recent adoption of the IAEA resolution on sanctions 
against it and to convey its strong message against the future 
sanctions by the UN Security Council. 
  He continued: The government will strongly cope with North 
Korea's threatening offensive, acting in concert with the 
international community's effort to guarantee North Korea's 
nuclear transparency. 
  Another government official said: Even after it declared 
that it was withdrawing from the IAEA, North Korea did not 
mention that it would not allow nuclear inspections at all, but 
said that it would not allow inspections for a limited time 
until it decides whether to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. This hints at North Korea's will 
to completely withdraw from the NPT system if the UN Security 
Council makes a decision to impose sanctions against it. 
  He then anticipated that such an action by North Korea, 
however, would not block the international community's process 
to push for sanctions by the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to prepare multifaceted measures in response to North 
Korea's reported withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 
  In this connection, the government will make an official 
announcement on the issue Tuesday morning after convening a 
committee to coordinate national unification and security 
policy. The meeting is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku, who is also national unification minister. 
  The government will likely urge North Korea to rejoin the 
IAEA and support international efforts to halt nuclear 
proliferation, in the judgement that Pyongyang's withdrawal from 
the agency is a direct refusal of international demands for 
nuclear transparency. 
  A government official said Pyongyang's announcement of its 
withdrawal from the IAEA could not be justified for any reason, 
stressing that "North Korea could not avoid the corresponding 
disadvantage unless it would abide by its duties as a member of 
the international community."

<F P=106> [Questions and answers between an unidentified announcer and </F>
Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun over telephone -- live] 
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will 
discuss countermeasures this afternoon after analyzing North 
Korea's real intention. Here is correspondent Cha Man-sun 
reporting from the IAEA on current movements. 
  [Announcer] Correspondent Cha Man-sun. 
  [Cha Man-sun] Yes. 
  [Announcer] How is the IAEA viewing North Korea's 
announcement of withdrawing its membership? 
  [Cha] The IAEA interprets North Korea's announcement of 
withdrawing its membership as giving up its rights and duties as 
a member state, and the refusal of inspections for assuring the 
continuity of inspection as a rejection of all inspections in 
accordance with the nuclear accord. The IAEA is greatly 
concerned that the continuity of inspections might be broken in 
North Korea. 
  IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that although the agency has 
not received an official notice from North Korea, it will 
discuss countermeasures this afternoon after analyzing North 
Korea's real intention. 
  According to an IAEA source, the nuclear accord, which went 
into effect in 1992, is effective as long as North Korea does 
not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
The source said it is of grave concern that North Korea might 
stubbornly insist that as a non-member state, it is not obliged 
to comply with the nuclear accord it signed with the IAEA. 
  The source said that while the NPT has 164 member states, 
the 
IAEA has only 122, and since many countries that are member 
states of the NPT are not IAEA members, at present, withdrawal 
from the NPT is more of a concern than IAEA membership to the 
international community. 
  [Announcer] Is North Korea's NPT membership still effective? 
  [Cha] The IAEA thinks so. Before I go into further detail, 
let me tell you about the official procedure of withdrawing IAEA 
membership. When an IAEA member state intends to withdraw, it 
has to notify the depository country, the United States. Then 
the United States will notify the IAEA Secretariat, the Board of 
Governors, and all member states. 
  Therefore, North Korea may withdraw from the IAEA 
immediately 
after an official notification to the United States. Paragraph 
1, Article 3 of the NPT from which North Korea has withheld its 
withdrawal, stipulates that NPT member states are obliged to 
sign a nuclear accord with the IAEA. North Korea became an IAEA 
member in September 1974, an NPT member in December 1985, and 
signed a nuclear accord in December 1991. The IAEA believes 
that the nuclear accord signed with North Korea is still 
effective because Article 26 of the nuclear accord signed 
between the IAEA and North Korea stipulates that the accord is 
effective as long as the country concerned is a member of the 
NPT. Therefore, North Korea is obliged to accept IAEA 
inspection in accordance with the nuclear accord. 
  On the other hand, two inspectors, who have remained in 
Yongbyon since 18 May, checked the refueling without any 
restriction until 13 June. What measures North Korea will take 
regarding the inspectors today is of great concern.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's threatened 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
although coming as a shock, is actually the weakest action it 
can take at this point. 
  For one thing, Pyongyang is not exempted from IAEA nuclear 
inspections even if it withdraws from the agency because such 
checks are obligatory under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty 
(NPT), not under IAEA membership rules. 
  North Korea is apparently saving NPT withdrawal, a much more 
drastic action that would sever all inspection obligations, for 
the future when the UN Security Council starts implementing 
sanctions. 
  In order to make its IAEA withdrawal official, North Korea 
must notify the United States in writing since it is the 
depository nation for the agency's statutes. 
  Once such notification is made, withdrawal becomes effective 
immediately. 
  North Korea joined the IAEA in 1974 and will be the first 
country to bolt the agency. 
  But the communist state remains in the NPT regime and it is 
this link with the NPT that keeps North Korea bound to 
inspection obligations. 
  In 1985 Pyongyang signed the NPT, an umbrella agreement 
requiring its members to comply with IAEA inspections in 
accordance with the safeguards accord. The IAEA, in short, 
conducts inspections on behalf of the NPT. As long as North 
Korea does not leave the NPT, the inspection requirements remain. 
  There are other nations which are non-members of the IAEA 
but 
are parties to the NPT, such as Taiwan and Latvia. This 
accounts for the difference in the size of membership between 
the two groups. 
  The IAEA has 118 members, including North Korea, while the 
NPT has a membership of 162. 
  Changes are afoot once Pyongyang leaves the IAEA. The agency 
paid for all inspection costs of past monitoring activities in 
North Korea; but if its withdrawal becomes effective, the North 
must bear the costs. 
  North Korea no longer needs to pay its share of the IAEA 
budget, currently 0.05 percent of the annual 20 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  Officials here say Pyongyang was driven to announce its IAEA 
withdrawal to show that its threat to leave the NPT is not 
merely bluster. 
  The IAEA, for the first time ever, adopted a sanctions 
resolution against North Korea on June 10 canceling 560,000 
dollars worth of technical aid. 
  The pullout announcement is in retaliation for this IAEA 
action as well as a threat of what may come next -- NPT 
withdrawal, officials say.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government expressed grave concern Tuesday over North Korea's 
announcement of its withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] and strongly urged Pyongyang to respond to 
the world community's demand for guaranteed nuclear transparency. 
  "We express our deep concern because North Korea's 
withdrawal 
from the IAEA makes the already serious nuclear problem more 
serious," said Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku. 
  Lee, who is also minister of the National Unification Board, 
made the statement at a press conference he held after presiding 
over a Unification and National Policy Coordinating Committee 
meeting Tuesday morning. 
  North Korea is wriggling out of all nuclear safeguards 
arrangements that guarantee the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula, he pointed out. 
  "The government strongly urges North Korea to cooperate with 
all nuclear safeguards arrangements laid down by the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)." 
  Yi noted that no unusual military movements have been 
detected in North Korea and said the Seoul government will 
continue working for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear 
dispute. 
  With regard to the government's response to the latest North 
Korean move, he said the international community was already 
moving toward sanctions, indicating that Seoul will continue to 
push for the plan at the U.N. Security Council. 
  Yi added, however, that North Korea's withdrawal from the 
IAEA would not hasten the adoption of U.N. sanctions. "We will 
keep a close watch on any development in the coming two to three 
weeks," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea warned North 
Korea Tuesday against deepening the nuclear crisis, voicing 
serious concern at Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "The government 
expresses serious concern at North Korea's announcement that it 
will withdraw from the IAEA in retaliation for the IAEA Board of 
Governors' recent sanctions resolution against North Korea," 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement. 
  "The government warns North Korea against worsening the 
situation regarding the nuclear problem," he said. Pyongyang 
should know that the international community will take a harder 
line through a U.N. Security Council sanctions resolution if 
North Korea fails to comply with all IAEA inspections as a party 
to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said. 
  "The government advises that North Korea accept the will of 
the international community and return as a responsible member 
of the world community," the statement said.

<F P=106> [By Ku Pon-yong] </F>
  [Text] North Korea decided on 13 June to withdraw from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in response to the 
international community's sanction pressure regarding the 
nuclear issue, and the development is gaining public attention. 
  The ostensible reason for North Korea's withdrawal is to 
repulse the IAEA resolution against North Korea. It can be 
further interpreted that North Korea will not respond to the 
international community's demand for the assurance of nuclear 
transparency for the time being even if the UN Security Council 
imposes sanctions. 
  However, it is early to determine whether the measure would 
extend to North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. According to international law, 
a country which has withdrawn from the IAEA could be free from 
obligations as a NPT member state within 24 hours. It is highly 
probable that North Korea would withdraw from the NPT judging 
from North Korea's announcement that it refuses all IAEA 
inspections and would regard the IAEA's demand for inspections 
as a declaration of war. 
  The government authorities provide two different 
interpretations on North Korea's strong measure. Since 
sanctions by the international community are inevitable anyway, 
North Korea intends to be free from the restrictions of 
international organizations and proceed with the development of 
nuclear weapons with its existing plutonium. The withdrawal 
from the IAEA means that North Korea would not accept any ad 
hoc, routine, or special inspections on its past nuclear 
activities and would not be restricted by any international 
organizations regarding its future nuclear programs. 
  On the other hand, some people believe that it is one of 
North Korea's brinkmanship strategies to maximize the effect of 
the nuclear card. North Korea estimates that even though it 
becomes a nonmember of the IAEA, it could continue 
behind-the-scene negotiations with the United States to 
accomplish its goals and then return to the IAEA again. North 
Korea believes only a strong measure could bring about a rapid 
development of its relations with the United States. 
  North Korea may be gambling on reversing the situation, in 
which it has brought on international sanctions by continuing 
the refueling, with a single blow. The withdrawal may reflect 
North Korea's intention to gain the third round of talks with 
the United States or at least proceed with the development of 
nuclear weapons taking hostage the ROK which wants "to avoid war 
by all means." 
  North Korea's reaction has such a complex background that 
its 
focus will be revealed only after the follow-up measures, 
possibly the withdrawal from the NPT or deporting of IAEA 
inspectors, are taken. There is a strong prospect that North 
Korea's intention may be revealed through former U.S. President 
Carter, who is scheduled to pay a personal visit to the North on 
15 June.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korea was certainly 
caught by surprise but the situation looked better than first 
imagined Tuesday after a night of fumbling over North Korea's 
announced withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). 
  "We always worked with a situation in mind where North Korea 
would go ahead and pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT)," said one Foreign Ministry official on condition 
of anonymity. "This is weaker than that, although it is 
apparently a prior warning." 
  Even when North Korea does formally quit the IAEA, its NPT 
membership still requires it to accept nuclear inspections by 
the agency. 
  North Korea was apparently well aware of this. In a Foreign 
Ministry statement Monday night announcing its IAEA withdrawal, 
Pyongyang said it would not comply with IAEA safeguards measures. 
  For a South Korean Government that stood ready to counter 
the 
North's NPT withdrawal, Monday's announcement was, as another 
ministry official put it, "the mildest action North Korea could 
take." 
  Predictable changes will first occur at the UN Security 
Council. The United States still hasn't tabled its draft 
resolution and is now expected to harden the tone of the 
resolution to show firmness toward North Korea. 
  "But the draft, if it is to change in tone, will not veer 
away from the original strategy," said the Foreign Ministry 
official. The original strategy is to seek step-by-step 
sanctions starting, for example, with a cultural and 
technological embargo. 
  Seoul's immediate concern is former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter's visit to Pyongyang, which begins Wednesday. 
  North Korea has used the repeated ploy of sending a double 
signal -- hard-line and conciliatory -- at the same time to sow 
confusion. 
  If the IAEA withdrawal is a hard-line message, then North 
Korean leader Kim Il-song may use Carter's visit to deliver a 
conciliatory message to the United States that Washington will 
find hard to either ignore or accept officially. 
  What North Korea suggests now can change the momentum at the 
UN Security Council, especially regarding China, which may 
insist on more diplomatic dialogue. 
  For now, Pyongyang is using the IAEA withdrawal card as a 
double-edged sword, waving it as a threat and trying to force 
the United States to the negotiating table. 
  Interpretations by officials here, in essence, focused on 
North Korea's need to show its threats were not merely words, 
especially before the UN Security Council resolution comes down. 
By showing that it can quit the NPT and actually leaving [as 
received] the IAEA, North Korea tried to hit a weak spot in 
Washington, which champions the NPT regime as a major element of 
foreign policy. 
  At the same time, North Korea strategically minimized the 
impact of its action by leaving its ties with the NPT intact to 
save this card for later in countering UN sanctions. 
  There is little that Seoul can do now, officials say, except 
to make sure that Carter understands South Korea's position on 
the current crisis and to ensure that its stance is reflected in 
the upcoming Security Council resolution.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Opposition leader Yi 
Ki-taek called on North Korea Tuesday to retract its 
announcement on quitting the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), asserting that such action will not help settle its 
nuclear row with the international community. 
  He also urged Pyongyang to guarantee the transparency of its 
nuclear development program and renounce its nuclear ambitions. 
  In an emergency press conference called at his Democratic 
Party office in the morning, he said, "I'm deeply concerned 
about a crisis of war being brought about by the government's 
unprincipled and incompetent diplomacy." 
  He called for a peaceful solution to the nuclear problem 
through a package deal, instead of through sanctions, and the 
convening of a special parliamentary session to discuss this 
pressing security issue. 
  On the failed parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae 
scandal, he criticized certain banks and government agencies for 
refusing to produce the documentary evidence requested by 
lawmakers, terming the refusal "an anti-social act." 
  The opposition party will sue those suspected of being 
involved in the scandal for bribery, impeach the finance, 
justice and defense ministers for obstructing the investigation 
and make public its own probe results and the military 
prosecution's investigation records, Yi said. 
  Commenting on the nuclear issue, he said, "the present 
government instils a sense of war crisis into the people's mind, 
the people are scared of war, and because of this the economy 
faces a crisis... Dealing with the issue, the government has 
only created confusion in its approach, using a stick one time 
and a carrot another time without any principle. It must now 
reconfirm the principle of avoiding war under any circumstances." 
  He added, "I'm ready to visit North Korea if it would help 
solve the nuclear issue." 
  Yi opposed any U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea 
outside 
the UN Security Council and urged the government to seek a 
peaceful solution through direct inter-Korean dialogue, 
including a summit, "instead of pushing for UN sanctions even by 
distorting the results of summit diplomacy." 
  Asked why the parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae 
scandal failed, he said the government had interfered with the 
probe by refusing to produce necessary data in an attempt to 
conceal the truth. 
  During the course of the investigation, the government 
exposed its immorality while destroying public trust in 
politics, he said. 
  The truth behind the scandal must be brought to light by 
amending the parliamentary inspection law to give it more teeth, 
he stressed.

  [Text] It is predicted that the situation will develop 
into a grave phase if North Korea, which has declared its 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 
should go out of the way to expel two IAEA inspectors who are 
now staying in North Korea. 
  A government official concerned warned: As a sovereign 
state, North Korea has the full freedom to withdraw from an 
international organization. If North Korea should expel the 
IAEA inspectors who are now staying in Pyongyang, however, this 
will not only be noncompliance with Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT], but also a direct challenge to the UN Security 
Council (?exhorting) that inspectors be permanently stationed in 
Pyongyang. This will bring about a serious consequence. 
  He also said: North Korea's duty to undergo IAEA nuclear 
inspections is not a requirement as a member of the IAEA, but as 
a party concerned to the NPT. Therefore, North Korea's latest 
measure is evaluated to be nothing but a political message 
simply aimed at achieving symbolic effects.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Tuesday North Korea's withdrawal from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was not anything surprising but was 
anticipated when the IAEA adopted sanctions against them 
recently. 
  "The withdrawal appears to be the initiative taken to avoid 
the disgrace of their being kicked out of the atomic energy 
agency," the president said. 
  While meeting with a group of 15 Mindan (pro-Seoul Korean 
Residents Association in Japan) leaders at Chongwadae 
[presidential offices], President Kim said that thus far there 
had been no signs of unusual military movement in North Korea. 
  He said Pyongyang's withdrawal from the IAEA seems directed 
against South Korea and the United States -- the United States 
in particular. 
  The president noted that the withdrawal was announced at 11 
p.m. Korea time Monday, which was a morning hour in the east of 
the United States. 
  Later in the day, President Kim met leading American 
businessmen who were in Seoul attending the seventh Korea-U.S. 
business conference. 
  Kim called on the visitors to invest more in Korea, saying 
there would be no problem in investment in Korea thanks to 
durable peace brought about by a firm cooperative system between 
South Korea and the United States. 
  The government would ease investment conditions and 
deregulate control so that foreign businesses would find it 
easier to do business in Korea, the president was quoted as 
saying by Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday that North Korea is still 
subjected to all the obligations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) because there has been no official notification by 
North Korea to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  In a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents Club, 
Minister Han also said "IAEA inspectors are still in North Korea 
and they should continue to be there to do their job." 
  Han said that the doors are still open to dialogues, 
although 
"the possibility seems much less now than several weeks ago." 
  "We still hope that North Korea would come to talks with 
South Korea, the IAEA and the United States. At the moment, 
North Koreans alone can ask that," said Han. "But North Korea 
should provide due grounds to have such dialogues." 
  On the question of possible military strike against the 
North 
being mentioned by U.S. medias, Han said that "nobody is 
discussing military strikes at this time." 
  Asked about the reports of the imminency of war or military 
confrontation, Han said, "We are making sure destruction does 
not take place. We take necessary measures. Despite war talks, 
there is no reason to worry about the outbreak of hostilities." 
  Han dismissed the North's words of threat, saying "That's 
just a scare tactics. We cannot base our response on the very 
irresponsible threat the very irresponsible country is making." 
  Minister Han said, however, that the resolution to be 
adopted 
by the U.N. Security Council should be more than symbolic one, 
adding "stronger resolution is needed" to make the North to 
comply with the international demands for complete inspection. 
  On the role of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in the 
nuclear standoff, Han hoped Carter would let the North Koreans 
know how seriously does the international community regard the 
situation. 
  "He did not tell me what he would tell the North Koreans. 
But I think he would tell the North how the world would react 
to the nuclear issue. I expect him to have very serious 
discussions with North Korean leaders," he said. 
  The very existence of any nuclear weapons in the North could 
be a threat in itself because of the possibility of their use 
and also because it may start proliferation in this region, said 
Han, adding "it would be a clear danger to us." 
  On the report that China would support the North in the 
event 
of war, Han said that he could not give credibility to such 
report. 
  Stressing that China has been playing a constructive role in 
the nuclear issue, Han said "Obviously, we do not know what the 
Chinese attitude will be," adding that he believes it would 
depend on how the North Koreans would respond to the whole 
process. 
  Rejecting any attempt to justify the North's possession of 
nuclear arms as an equalizer, Han said "You cannot disregard the 
danger of nuclear weapons and the cost of holding on to it will 
continue to rise." 
  Minister Han also said that his government would continue to 
honor the denuclearization declaration which he said the North 
has already violated, adding "We have no intention to give up 
the declaration."

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The Military Armistice 
Commission (MAC) has suspended foreign tourist trips to the 
truce village of Panmunjom, while the South Korean Defense 
Ministry is restricting the number of foreigners who visit 
underground tunnels near the truce line, tourism sources said 
Tuesday. 
  The moves are apparently related to the rising tension 
fueled 
by the North Korean nuclear dispute, the sources said. 
  The MAC recently notified the Korea Travel Bureau, Inc. of 
its decision to suspend visits by foreign tourists to Panmunjom 
for a week from Monday. The travel company has exclusive rights 
to arrange foreign tourists' trips to Panmunjom. 
  Without citing any reason, the MAC said that such tours 
would 
be possible again in a week. 
  With the MAC notification, the travel company has canceled 
Panmumjom tours which amount to an average 100 foreign tourists 
per day. 
  A business source said the MAC has often suspended Panmunjom 
tours according to conditions at the truce village, such as 
military training, and speculated that the abrupt suspension 
might not be related to the tension between South and North 
Korea. 
  Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry recently did not approve 
parts of applications submitted by travel agencies for 
foreigners to tour underground tunnels dug by North Korea at the 
truce line, causing the cancellation of these tours. 
  Another business source said the Defense Ministry had 
notified the Korea Association of General Travel Agents that the 
number of Korean and foreign tourists recently exceeded the 
appropriate number of people to observe the tunnels.

  [Text] United Nations, June 13 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations Madeleine Albright said Monday the first 
draft resolution calling for U.N. sanctions against North Korea 
might be circulated within 24 hours. 
  Commenting on North Korea's announcement that it would quit 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Albright said 
that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the agency, if it were true, 
would be a serious problem and would make the situation worse. 
  Meanwhile, representatives of the 10 non-permanent members 
of 
the U.N. Security Council had separate meetings with the South 
Korean and Japanese ambassadors here Monday to exchange views on 
sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  South Korean Ambassador Yu Chong-ha said, "Judging from 
North 
Korea's attitude at this juncture of the scheduled third round 
of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea, 
Pyongyang seems determined to develop nuclear weapons." He then 
called on the Security Council to adopt sanctions to stop the 
North's suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  The council's non-standing members are to meet with North 
Korea's U.N. Ambassador Pak Kil-yon Tuesday on similar matters. 
  The Security Council is expected to hold a closed meeting 
Tuesday to continue discussion of the North Korean nuclear issue 
including its withdrawal from the IAEA. 
  The United States has almost completed a draft resolution 
calling for the step-by-step imposition of sanctions. Upon 
approval by President Bill Clinton, the draft will be circulated 
within the Security Council after Korea-U.S. consultations. 
  The draft resolution could be distributed to the council as 
early as Tuesday, but other U.N. sources predicted it would be 
determined after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter returns from 
Pyongyang.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu has asked former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter, who travels to North Korea Wednesday, to make sure 
Pyongyang realizes there is an end to Seoul's and Washington's 
patience on the nuclear crisis. 
  Han shared a two-hour lunch with Carter at a downtown hotel 
Tuesday and emphasized that North Korea needs to understand the 
international community's firm position on its nuclear program, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Carter passes through the heavily fortified truce village of 
Panmunjom Wednesday morning and is scheduled to meet with North 
Korean leader Kim Il-song before returning to Seoul Saturday. 
  Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The former U.S. President is 
going to North Korea as head of the private peace center he 
established in his home state of Georgia. 
  Carter explained that he was first invited by Pyongyang in 
1991 and has since sought to visit both Koreas. North Korean 
officials invited him to come again recently and he decided he 
could play a positive role in helping defuse the problem, Carter 
was quoted as saying. 
  Both Seoul and Washington have repeatedly stressed that 
Carter comes and goes as a private citizen and that he is not a 
U.S. envoy. 
  But with North Korea's unexpected announcement Monday that 
it 
is withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), officials here admit that Carter could find out North 
Korea's intentions and drive home a message from Seoul and 
Washington. 
  Foreign Minister Han, noting that the visit comes at a very 
sensitive time, asked Carter to take special care in conveying 
to North Korea exactly how serious the nuclear situation has 
become, officials said. 
  Carter responded that by delivering such information, he 
hopes to contribute to the problem's solution through dialogue, 
they said. 
  Han stressed that North Korea's latest actions, including 
its 
announced withdrawal from the IAEA, make hard-line 
coutermeasures by the international community inevitable. 
  The North must be made aware that unless it changes its 
attitude soon, the South and the United States will run out of 
patience, Han was quoted as saying.

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 14 June 
publish editorials, reports, and articles on former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter's upcoming visit to North Korea. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word 
editorial entitled "North Korea's Withdrawal from IAEA and 
Carter's Visit to North Korea." The editorial notes that Carter, 
who is expected to meet North and South Korea's presidents at a 
time when the North Korean nuclear issue has become the top 
world issue, can be regarded as the most important nuclear 
envoy. However, the editorial states that North Korea, while 
waiting for Carter, chose a hardline position, namely the 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
instead of making an appeasement gesture, and put a wet blanket 
on the expectations for Carter's visit, thus causing people to 
worry about the possibility of Kim Il-song taking advantage of 
Carter's visit. Recalling Kim Il-song's past tactics to 
selectively invite Americans and give them the warm treatment, 
the editorial stresses that Kim Il-song's propagandistic remarks 
have more falsehood than truth as shown in the case of North 
Korea's promise to allow the IAEA's nuclear inspections. The 
editorial points out that "even if the United States begins to 
support North Korea's light-water reactor, North Korea will 
undoubtedly continue extracting plutonium from the so-called 
'military facilities' while pretending that it froze the 
extraction of plutonium only in a certain reactor." 
  The editorial then calls on Jimmy Carter to keenly be aware 
of this situation during his visit to North Korea, and not be 
dragged into Kim Il-song's deceitful tactics. The paper 
concludes that "at a time when the people think that there is no 
other means but sanctions, Carter's visit may be the last 
opportunity for North Korea. North Korea should not attempt to 
use Carter just as it has used other people who visited North 
Korea in the past." 
  CHOSON ILBO also publishes on page 4 a 1,500-word article by 
reporter Kim Tu-sik, under the headline "Carter's Visit to North 
Korea--What He Should Do and What He Should Not Do in 
Pyongyang." The article notes that the people are hoping that 
during his visit to North Korea, Carter will clearly convey to 
the Kim Il-song regime the resolute will of the international 
community for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem. 
The paper expresses the hope that "Carter will emphasize that 
only when North Korea immediately allows the 'special 
inspection' of two undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon as 
demanded by the ROK and the United States, can North Korea get 
rid of the sanctions crisis." The paper then stresses that 
"Carter should urge North Korea to make public the record on the 
extraction of plutonium in the past and detailed additional 
information on the operational plan of the reactor in Yongbyon." 
The article adds that Carter should raise the issue of reform 
and openness of the North Korean society, as well as its human 
rights issue. 
  As the points that Carter should refrain from doing, the 
article emphasizes that Carter should not give a wrong message 
that may encourage North Korea's hopes; should refrain from 
causing North Korea to misunderstand that he is a special envoy 
of the U.S. Government, and should not exaggerate the result of 
his visit to North Korea. The paper concludes by saying that our 
government will inform Jimmy Carter of our aforementioned hope 
before he crosses Panmunjom on 15 June. 
  The moderate daily TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word editorial entitled "We Call On Carter To Grasp North 
Korea's True Intention." Attaching importance to Carter's 
meeting with Kim Il- song during which mutual messages may be 
exchanged, the editorial expresses the belief that he is the 
last nuclear special envoy of the U.S. Government, although he 
stated that his visit is strictly personal, in view of his past 
role in U.S.-Syrian relations and in negotiations for the 
Ethiopian war. Pointing to a possibility for North Korea to take 
advantage of his visit for a peace offensive to evade sanctions 
and for gaining time, the paper asks Carter to precisely inform 
North Korea of the international community's demand and to grasp 
North Korea's true intentions, whether they are aimed at 
establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and 
receiving support for a light-water reactor, or at ultimately 
pursuing nuclear development. 
  The paper also calls on Carter to raise North Korea's human 
rights issue while in Pyongyang since he was known as the 
president for human rights, and to demonstrate his ability in 
blocking North Korea's nuclear development since he blocked the 
ROK's nuclear development plan while he was in office. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,600-word 
article by reporter Ko Tae-song, entitled "The Government To 
Cope With the North Korean Nuclear Issue Based on Sense of 
Reality." Pointing to recent delicate and cautious changes in 
the government steps to deal with the North Korean nuclear 
problem, the article states that the government appears to be 
turning from a hardline position by favoring sanctions to the 
attitude of accepting the reality that requires active 
participation of China and Russia, and this government attitude 
is reflected in viewing Carter's visit to North Korea. The 
article notes that the government was at first worried about a 
possibility of Carter being dragged in by North Korea's delaying 
and propaganda tactics but is now trying to take the best 
advantage of his visits to both North and South of Korea for 
directly conveying the worries and warnings of the international 
community and of our government to North Korea on its nuclear 
problem. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 
1,200-word article by reporter Yi Song-chol, entitled "Carter's 
Role--Half Affirmative, Half Negative." The paper notes that the 
government's view on Carter's visit to North Korea is more on 
the negative side at the moment because his visit may give 
unfavorably impact our security strategy when sanctions are 
being discussed at the UN Security Council. On the contrary, 
some people are hoping for his positive role because he 
maintains special relations with the Clinton administration and 
because North Korea expressed the will to invite Carter since 
1991. The article refers to remarks made by Professor Kim Yu-nam 
from Danguk University on the possibility of Carter taking a 
certain U.S. message accepting the North Korean demands. 
However, the article says: "Most experts point out that the 
success of Carter's visit depends more on what kind of message 
North Korea will give him rather than on whether he will bring a 
message with him or not and than on his role as a mediator."

<F P=106> [Report from KBS General Bureau in Pusan] </F>
  [Text] In connection with North Korea's nuclear issue, a 
ROK-U.S. joint inspection has been conducted of a ROK vessel 
that will be mobilized to transport U.S. military supplies in an 
emergency. 
  The inspection was conducted at Point No. 1 of the Central 
Pier of Pusan Harbor on 10 June. It has been confirmed that an 
inspection was conducted of the facilities of the vessel; of the 
procedure to hand over the vessel in an emergency; and of the 
status of the fuel storage of No. 9 Donam, a 4,998 tonne-class 
cargo vessel belonging to the Hung-A Maritime Company. 
  An official concerned at Pusan Harbor said: As South-North 
relations have recently become tense, I understand an inspection 
has been conducted of a vessel that will be mobilized in an 
emergency. In an emergency, several vessels, including tankers 
and passenger ships--besides the aforementioned vessel--will be 
handed over to the U.S. Armed Forces.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and 
Energy Minister Kim Chol-su on Monday expressed concern about a 
move of the United States to revise its anti-dumping-related 
laws and regulations in a way advantageous to itself contrary to 
the norms of the Uruguay Round agreement. 
  "The Super Article 301 which the United States has revived 
through an administrative order does not go compatible with the 
principle of the new World Trade Organization (WTO)," Kim said. 
  Speaking at the seventh Korea-U.S. business conference held 
at the Hotel Intercontinental, Minister Kim said the United 
States should not arbitrarily invoke the Super Article 301. 
  He stressed that any inter-country trade disputes should be 
resolved under procedures duly laid down by the World Trade 
Organization. 
  Kim also said he expects the United States' investment in 
South Korea would be further spurred in the days ahead. 
  "American investors should know we have such merits as an 
extensive market, able work force, ability to digest high-tech 
projects and political stability," he said. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador James Laney said at the 
conference 
that South Korea should ease imports control of consumption 
goods such as automobiles and cable television programs. 
  He said a serious imbalance is shown between the two 
countries in the exports and imports of automobile, which he 
said is due to South Korea's "unreasonable tariffs policy and 
complex imports permit regulations." 
  Laney also expressed the hope that South Korea will further 
ease regulations in the broad areas of cable TV programs or 
software designs. This will be helpful to strengthening South 
Korea's own international competitiveness, he said. 
  The American ambassador said that South Korea's consumption 
goods market, which he said was closed in the past, is getting 
opened step by step. 
  Still, he said, South Korean bureaucrats have the means of 
making imports difficult and imports are still regarded by many 
people as something immoral. 
  Consumption goods imports will give an opportunity for 
Korean 
consumers to conserve goods and will lead Korean industries to 
increase productivity, Laney said. 
  Prevention of consumption goods imports was taken as the 
manifestation of patriotism in the past, but this is a time for 
the South Korean Government to switch to a new stance, 
Ambassador Laney said.

<F P=106> [By Pak Chong-mun] </F>
  [Text] As the ROK-U.S. Economic Council meeting scheduled 
for 24 June in Washington draws near, the government has set out 
the work of lowering tariffs on foreign cars and improving 
related systems. However, the government is in trouble due to 
differences of opinion between government offices. 
  As a result of a series of recent policy meetings, the 
government made a rough decision to present to the United States 
our initial proposal for a package solution that includes the 
ROK's promise to lower tariffs at the minimum level and to 
improve related systems. However, it is undergoing difficulties 
in mapping out a final draft for the solution to the issue since 
government offices, such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs 
and Finance, failed to narrow differences of opinion on the 
scope of tariff reduction and on the necessity of lowering 
domestic duties. 
  A Foreign Ministry official said on 13 June: "As the 
scheduled 24 June Washington meeting of the ROK-U.S. Economic 
Council headed by both countries' deputy foreign ministers draws 
near, related government offices held discussions on measures 
for it, such as lowering tariffs and domestic duties. However, 
they have only agreed to the necessity of a small-scale tariff 
reduction and the improvement of related system and failed to 
prepare concrete measures." 
  This official also said: "It is inevitable for us to show a 
sincere attitude by making some concessions in the upcoming 
Economic Council meeting because the United States considers the 
car import issue as a pending core trade issue between the ROK 
and the United States, and because of the serious imbalance 
between the ROK's car exports to the United States and U.S. car 
exports to the ROK." 
  The official said that the Foreign Ministry, as the office 
in 
charge of negotiations, is in trouble since, as the Ministry of 
Finance noted, it is in fact impossible to simply change the 
system of domestic duties -- such as special excise tax, 
acquisition tax, and education tax. 
  He added: "I am very much concerned about the possibility 
that, if we do not propose satisfactory compromise terms in the 
upcoming meeting, the United States will use it as a ruse for 
invoking the Super 301 provision, regarding the ROK's attitudes 
toward the car import issue and the sausage clearance issue as 
unfair trade practices.

  [Text] According to reports, the United States openly 
disclosed recently an attempt to isolate and crush [korip 
apsalharyonun] our Republic by force. 
  At the 9 June hearings of the Subcommittee on Asia and the 
Pacific of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, made the 
threatening remarks that the United States could impose military 
sanctions on our country. 
  He expressed that the U.S. basic position, that it does not 
rule out military sanctions against North Korea, had not 
changed. He also repeatedly babbled [chwechossumnida] that if 
the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution on 
sanctions, independent [tokchajok] sanctions outside the United 
Nations would be possible. He even openly stated that no 
DPRK-U.S. talks could take place unless we accepted the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's unjust demands. 
  In the 10 June telephone conversation with South Korean 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, U.S. President Clinton had a 
conspiracy discussion [mouihago] on imposing multinational 
sanctions outside the United Nations and disclosed a plan to 
strengthen the U.S. Forces in South Korea on a large scale, 
including the early deployment of quick reaction forces. 
  Meanwhile, the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, conducted 
off the coast of Hawaii, a comprehensive combat training, 
scheduled to last for approximately one week, began on 10 June. 
In reporting on this, Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN notes that this 
exercise is conducted with the United States, Japan, and South 
Korea posing as a group and confronting the enemy side and that 
this U.S.-Japan-South Korea joint exercise, the first of its 
kind, is intended to step up their threat against our country. 
  The newspaper reveals that U.S. aircraft carriers 
Independence and Constellation, which had been participating in 
the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, would immediately be 
headed for the waters close to the Korean peninsula after 
concluding the exercise.

<F P=106> ["Total Removal of Nuclear Threat is Vital to </F>
Denuclearization of Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- If the Korean peninsula 
is to be denuclearized, the nuclear threat must be totally 
eliminated from this region, declares NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today. 
  Eliminating the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula 
means, 
in essence, removing the U.S. nuclear threat and putting an end 
to the nuclear armament of Japan and the South Korean puppets, 
the article says, and continues: 
  What should be done first of all for the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula is to terminate the U.S. nuclear threat. 
The elimination of the U.S. nuclear weapons and the removal of 
its nuclear threat on the peninsula are the key to its 
denuclearization. 
  It is also necessary for the denuclearization of the 
peninsula to put a period to Japan's nuclear armament. 
  The nuclear armament of Japan poses a nuclear threat to the 
DPRK and obstructs the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
Putting an end to Japan's nuclear armament is an urgent demand 
arising in the total removal of the nuclear threat in this 
region and the denuclearization of the peninsula. 
  Checking the nuclear arms development by the South Korean 
puppets is also imperative. In actuality, the joint declaration 
on denuclearization has been reduced to a dead letter and the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula made impossible by the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam. 
  The nuclear threat by the United States, Japan and the South 
Korean puppets is contrary to the trend of the time. 
  The nuclear threat must be totally removed and the Korean 
peninsula be turned nuclear free.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held in 
the United States on June 6 on the occasion of the month of 
solidarity with the Korean people (June 25-July 27) and the 1st 
anniversary of the adoption of DPRK-U.S. joint statement (June 
1993). 
  Present there were public figures including representatives 
of the co-sponsor organizations -- the New Jersey Peace Action, 
the Montclair Committee on Central America, the International 
League of Women for Peace and Freedom, the Penny Row Hammer 
Branch Organization of the New Jersey Rainbow Federation, the 
Single Peace Committee, the Montclair UN-U.S. branch 
organization and the South Mountain Peace Action. The deputy 
chief of the DPRK mission in the United Nations was invited. 
  Kim Hyo-sin, vice-chairman of the Federation of Churches of 
South Koreans in his speech at the meeting exposed the injustice 
of the U.S. policy towards Korea and the partiality of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and demanded that the United 
States stop pressure and blackmail against the DPRK and improve 
its relations with the latter. 
  Paul Ahuja, representative of the International Action 
Center, said in his speech that the U.S. possessed of a large 
quantity of nuclear weapons and plutonium is threatening North 
Korea with "sanctions," saying it might have "nuclear weapons." 
  He said [words indistinct] that U.S. Forces are present in 
South Korea "to defend freedom, democracy and peace" is a sheer 
lie. He stressed that a peace agreement must be signed between 
the DPRK and the U.S. and Korea must be reunified in a peaceful 
way. 
  He called upon the participants to sign the signature paper 
supporting "10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole 
Nation for the Reunification of the Country" advanced by the 
great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Susan Bailey, co-chairman of the U.S. Get Out of Korea 
Committee said that the United States is threatening North Korea 
over the "nuclear issue" in order to stifle its socialist system. 
  She calls for solidarity with the Korean people in the 
struggle for defending the independence of their country and 
socialism. 
  The participants signed the paper supporting the 10-point 
programme.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Downright Expression of </F>
Anti-Republic Hostile Policy"] 
  [Text] The Japanese authorities' suppression of the General 
Association of Korean residents in Japan [Chongnyon] is getting 
all the more vicious. 
  As has been already reported, the Japanese authorities 
recently committed an outrage by sending several hundred 
policemen, raiding the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of 
Chongnyon, and searching many places including houses of 
Chongnyon functionaries on the groundless pretext of a violation 
of the national land utilization law. The recent raid and search 
commotion, which followed its crackdown on the Osaka prefectural 
organization of Chongnyon in April, is a deliberate act to 
destroy the Chongnyon organization and block its patriotic 
activities and is an unpardonable criminal act. 
  As is known, Koreans in Japan did not go to Japan on their 
own initiative. They are the ones who were drafted by the 
Japanese imperialists who colonialized Korea or their offspring. 
The Chongnyon is a dignified organization of overseas citizens 
of our Republic which launches the righteous activities of 
safeguarding the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan 
and promoting friendly relations with the Japanese people. 
Accordingly, the Japanese authorities should protect them and 
value their rights, instead of intensifying suppression of the 
Chongnyon. 
  Nonetheless, the Japanese authorities raided Chongnyon 
organizations and houses of Chongnyon functionaries, and 
searched them in broad daylight by fabricating groundless 
excuses. This is an extension line of the policy of 
obliterating Chongnyon, an expression of their undisguised 
hostile policy towards us and Chongnyon, and a grave challenge 
to them. 
  The Japanese authorities are these days becoming all the 
more 
malicious in their attempt to stifle us over our so-called 
nuclear issue while making haste with so-called sanctions and 
adopting emergency legislature. While openly babbling about the 
dispatch of the Self-Defense Armed Forces to the front line of 
South Korea in case of emergency, the Japanese authorities 
mobilized its armed forces to a southeast area adjacent to the 
Korean peninsula in accordance with a new military strategy. 
  Timed to coincide with this, their provocative act committed 
against the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon was not 
a mere mistake as they have insisted. This is part of the 
anti-Republic hostile policy which has been stepped up 
maliciously through collusion and collaboration with the United 
States and the South Korean puppets, and a deliberate and 
premeditated act designed by the Japanese authorities. The 
Japanese authorities have launched into a heinous anti-Chongnyon 
campaign whenever the anti-Republic moves of the United States 
and the South Korean puppets got hysterical. This is a clear 
proof of it. 
  Regarding the suppression of Chongnyon and the hostile 
policy 
toward our Republic, the present Japanese authorities are more 
arrogant and tyrannical than their predecessors. What they 
pursue is realizing the past dream of becoming a colonial 
dominator by involving itself in another war of aggression on 
Korea by following the United States' emergency scenario. 
However, this is nothing but an anachronistic wild dream and 
only reveals their unchangeable aggressive nature. 
  The DPRK Foreign Ministry clearly declared that if Japan 
should take the lead or be inveigled or join force in any 
sanctions against us, we would regard it as a declaration of 
war, and Japan would be unable to evade a deserving punishment 
for it. 
  We never use empty words. Japan occupied our country for 
almost half a century, committing never-to-be-condoned crimes to 
our nation, and has not atoned for its past criminal acts up to 
now. Japan must ponder the consequences to be entailed by its 
anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and act with discretion. 
  The Japanese authorities should immediately stop their 
hostile policy toward our Republic and their suppression of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for the recent case 
and sternly punish the chief culprits. If the Japanese 
authorities continue to step up their suppression of Chongnyon, 
joining the anti-Republic commotion of the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppets, they will have to pay a dear price for 
it.

<F P=106> ["Don't Run Riot"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, far from making an official apology for the police 
raid on the Kyoto Headquarters of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and search of houses of 
Chongnyon officials and other places, blared that "there was 
nothing wrong in the precedures of the search." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that this 
revealed once again the craftiness and effrontery peculiar to 
Japan. 
  Recalling that a situation resembling that on the eve of the 
past Korean war has been created in Japan now, the analyst says: 
  The Japanese reactionaries should know clearly what a 
country 
the DPRK is, what a people the Koreans are and how great our 
might is. And they must not doubt the will of our people who 
mean what they say. 
  Should Japan join in "sanctions" against us, whether she 
takes the van or is inveigled into it, we will regard it as a 
declaration of war and then she will not be able to evade a 
deserved punishment. This warning is anything but an empty word. 
The Japanese authorities should ponder over the lot in which 
Japan would find itself, if this warning of ours is carried into 
practice. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must not run riot but promptly 
stop their hostile policy against the DPRK and the repression of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. This advice is quite beneficial 
to Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Working people of 
various strata in Pyongyang held a mass rally today and bitterly 
denounced the Japanese reactionaries' reckless suppression of 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) 
and Koreans in Japan as a gross infringement upon the dignity 
and sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  In his speech, Yu Ho-chun, director of the Secretariat of 
the 
Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification 
of the Fatherland, said: The recent fascist suppression and 
persecution of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by the Japanese 
reactionaries are hostile acts most vicious ever since the 
inauguration of Chongnyon. In view of their look and danger the 
acts remind us of the eve of the Korean war when the Japanese 
reactionaries suppressed the Federation of Koreans in Japan 
(Choyon) and Japan-resident Koreans. 
  Noting that the suppression was not an accidental incident, 
the speaker said: 
  The Japanese reactionaries are now openly scheming 
"constitutional amendment," "emergency legislative arrangements" 
and "measures for domestic security" in a bid to stage a 
military comeback to Korea and the rest of Asia, while serving 
the U.S. imperialists and the international reactionary forces 
as a shock brigade in their frantic moves to isolate and stifle 
the DPRK under the pretext of its fictitious "nuclear issue." 
  Branding the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan 
by 
the Japanese reactionaries as a heinous crime which cannot be 
justified with anything, Yu Ho-chun said: 
  We cannot remain an onlooker to the criminal acts of the 
Japanese authorities, who have committed an unheard-of 
suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, availing 
themselves of the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and the 
South Korean puppets. We will always keep tabs on them. 
  The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, pondering 
over all the consequences to be entailed by their antagonism 
against and harsh suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan 
and promptly stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves. 
  Speeches were made also by Vice-chairman of the Korean 
Committee for Aiding Overseas Compatriots Kim Tong-sop, 
permanent member of the Korea-Japan Friendship Association Paek 
Pong-kyu, a faculty dean of the Korean University of Chongnyon 
Ku Tae-sok and Korea-resident Japanese woman Sin Chong-ho. 
  They demanded that the Japanese reactionaries immediately 
stop the suppression of Chongnyon, apologize for it, liquidate 
the past doings of aggression and plunder against the Korean 
people and make an adequate compensation, clearly mindful that 
the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan is a foolish 
act of wringing their own necks. 
  A letter of protest to the Japanese Government was adopted 
at 
the rally. 
  It says that though the Japanese authorities intend to 
attain 
their sinister political purpose without difficulty by launching 
the repressive campaign against Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan 
at a time when the international reactionaries are intensifying 
their moves to take "sanctions" against the DPRK, this is a 
mistake. 
  The letter says: 
  The Japanese authorities must stop acting rashly and know 
that antagonism against the DPRK and the suppression of 
Chongnyon will bring nothing favorable to them. 
  Strong is the will and resolution of the Korean people at 
home and in Japan, who hold the sovereignty and dignity of the 
nation dearer than their lives. 
  We strongly demand that the Japanese authorities apologize 
for the unjustifiable suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in 
Japan, promise to refrain from such acts and take steps to 
sternly punish the masterminds of the recent cases. 
  We also state that it is a good option for the Japanese 
authorities not to join the international reactionaries in their 
reckless moves to take "sanctions" against the DPRK in a bid to 
stifle it. 
  We will never tolerate the infringement on the national 
dignity and democratic national rights of Chongnyon, an 
organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in 
Japan but decisively counter it to the end. 
  Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea Kim Chung-nin and Vice-premier of the Administration 
Council Chang Chol were present at the rally.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The high-handed 
Japanese police crackdown upon organizations of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) has been 
protested unremittingly by Chongnyon organizations and Korean 
residents across Japan and Japanese political party and 
organizations, the Tokyo-based Korean news service reported. 
  Officials and Korean residents under the Kyoto prefectural 
headquarters of Chongnyon went to the prefectural police on June 
8 to express their resentment at the authorities' refusal to 
make an apology. They strongly urged the police to make an 
apology in a responsible manner and show sincere attitude and 
action. 
  The Japan Social-democratic Party [JSDP] has conducted 
positive activities to investigate the truth behind the police 
crackdown on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and 
lodge a strong protest with it. 
  It decided at the Tuesday meeting of its leading officials 
and at the Wednesday general meeting of its Dietmen to send a 
fact-finding team to Kyoto and actively call the authorities to 
account for it at the Diet. 
  Inquiries were made at the judicial affairs committee of the 
Japanese Diet on June 7 by Tomio Sakagami and, on June 8, at 
the Budget Committee by Sekisuke Nakanishi and at the Judicial 
Affairs Committee by Tatsukuni Komori, accusing the authorities 
of their unjust and illegal search. 
  The JSDP Nagano prefectural headquarters, prefectural 
government centre and prefectural people's council, in joint 
name, and the chief of the JSDP Miyagi prefectural headquarters 
made public protest statements and sent them to the Kyoto 
prefectural police authorities. The 67th regular meeting of the 
Fukuoka prefectural Teachers' Union adopted a special 
resolution, and decided that all its branch organizations should 
take an emergency act of sending protest telegrams to the prime 
minister and the chief of the Kyoto prefectural police 
headquarters. 
  Korean residents under Higashiosaka and Minamiosaka branches 
of the Chongnyon Osaka prefectural headquarters staged protests 
against the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the 
Higashi police station. Delegates of the Federation of Korean 
Traders and Industrialists in Japan and the League of Korean 
Youth in Japan joined in the struggle, encouraging compatriots 
in Osaka prefecture. 
  The chairman of the Higashiosaka Council for Japan-Korea 
Friendship, a representative of the Nishigobe Society for the 
Study of Korean Affairs and delegates of the Amagasaki Society 
for the Study of Japanese-Korean affairs in their respective 
protest messages published in front of the Osaka prefectural 
police headquarters condemned the unjustifiable police search 
and encouraged Korean residents.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) released a statement on June 12. 
  It warns: 
  "If the Japanese authorities continue their acts of 
deliberately aggravating the situation, taking advantage of the 
vicious pressure campaign of the United States and the South 
Korean authorities against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, in disregard of the demand of our nation, they will be 
held responsible for the consequences arising therefrom." 
  "The raid on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) was 
a fascist outrage against Koreans overseas and an unpardonable 
political suppression," the statement says, and goes on: 
  "We cannot but call in question the fact that all the 
hostile 
acts persistently committed by the Japanese authorities against 
Chongnyon are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK campaign of 
the United States and the South Korean authorities. 
  "The Koreans residing in Japan are mostly victims who were 
taken there as `labor draftees' for the Japanese imperialists' 
war of aggression on the continent and forced to toils, 
undergoing all manner of national humiliation and harsh 
maltreatment in the past, and their descendants. 
  "Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities, far from repenting 
of this and making compensations, are repeating the past crimes 
today. This naturally arouses the resentment of the whole nation. 
  "The North side headquarters of Pomminnyon can hardly 
repress 
indignation at the surprise raid on and search of Chongnyon 
organisations by the Japanese police and strongly urge the 
Japanese authorities to immediately stop such criminal 
suppression and apologize for it and punish those responsible 
for it."

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Reinvasion Moves of Japanese Militarism" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries are now zealously joining the United States in its 
policy of stifling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
fully revealing the wild ambition of revived militarism for 
reinvasion, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are going ahead with legislative 
arrangements to quickly send "Self-Defense Forces" to the Korean 
peninsula in "the event of contingency," declaring that they 
will take an active part in "collective security measures" in 
case "sanctions" were taken against the DPRK, the analyst says, 
and continues: 
  They are crying over the DPRK's "nuclear threat" so 
hysterically for the purpose of converting Japan into a military 
power equipped with nuclear weapons under that pretext and 
realising with the backing of the United States the old dream of 
"the greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" which Japan failed 
to do in the past. 
  To dominate Asia is the invariable design of the Japanese 
reactionaries. It is to this end that they are now making haste 
with the conversion of Japan into a military power and her 
nuclear armament. They intend to divert the worldwide 
denunciation elsewhere from Japan and justify their moves to 
turn Japan into a military power armed with nuclear weapons by 
widely spreading the rumor about the DPRK's "nuclear threat." 
  They are also scheming to stage a comeback to Korea and 
other 
Asian nations by actively partaking of the aggressive military 
actions of the United States. 
  The peace and security of Northeast Asia and the 
Asian-Pacific region are gravely threatened by Japan.

of Imposing Sanctions"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China and president of the People's Republic of China, clarified 
China's stand regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula in his interview with a chief commentator of the Japan 
Broadcasting Corporation in Zhongnanhai on June 10. 
  He said: 
  "China is not in favor of imposing sanctions because that is 
useless for the settlement of the problem. On the contrary, it 
would aggravate the escalation of the situation and lead to a 
serious consequence that all parties concerned do not want to 
see. 
  "It is my view that persevering in dialogue and 
consultations 
is an effective and fundamental way to solve the problem". 
  "We urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act 
with caution," he said, and added: "The goal for the settlement 
of the issue is finally to safeguard peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization. 
  "No matter what temporary difficulties may appear, it is 
possible to find a proper solution to this problem as long as 
these two major objectives are not departed from." 
  Noting that the door for negotiation is not completely 
closed 
and that there still exist possibilities of holding dialogue, he 
urged all parties concerned to take positive measures so as to 
avoid acceleration of the crisis.

  [Text] According to a report from XINHUA News Agency, 
China conducted an underground nuclear test on the morning of 10 
June. While making an announcement on this, the spokesman of the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China will completely ban and 
thoroughly destroy nuclear weapons, and that in this connection, 
it consistently supports the realization of a comprehensive 
nuclear test ban. 
  He said that stemming from this fundamental position, China 
has been manifesting great self-restraint from the beginning in 
conducting nuclear tests, and that the number of nuclear tests 
conducted by China is very limited. 
  He said that China completely respects and understands the 
position and worry of many nonnuclear countries in connection 
with the issue of nuclear tests. The spokesman said that 
currently China is actively taking part in the negotiations on 
the comprehensive test ban treaty, and through this kind of 
negotiations, China supports the conclusion of such a treaty 
before 1996. He said that such a treaty must be a measure for a 
complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  He said that China demands that other countries that possess 
nuclear weapons must give up their policy on restraining nuclear 
weapons and clearly promise the complete prohibition and 
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The spokesman said 
that to quickly realize this ultimate goal, China is willing to 
continue to persistently make efforts with the international 
community.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- A solidarity letter 
came from Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez hoping 
that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula will be resolved 
peacefully through negotiations, not by pressure and strong-arm 
action. 
  Charging that the United States of America is getting 
overheated in further arming South Korea, while increasing 
international pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, he reaffirmed the opinion that a reasonable solution in 
face of the explosive situation of the Korean peninsula is not a 
military option but negotiation. 
  He, on behalf of the Cuban Government and people, expressed 
the belief that the strain will surely be eased and the most 
reasonable way be opened for the DPRK Government and people in 
the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.

the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always adhered to 
the independent stand, it has been able to defend the national 
dignity and successfully carry on the cause of socialism in any 
storm and stress. 
  A seminar on the work "Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable" 
took place at the department of the state in charge of 
irrigation of the Ministry of Agriculture of Mozambique. 
  The speakers said the work is a great textbook of revolution 
that gives a scientific exposition of the unavoidableness of the 
downfall of imperialism and the inevitability of the triumph of 
socialism. 
  Noting that though the imperialists are trying to destroy 
Korean socialism, it is a daydream, they stressed that nobody 
can match the Korean people united closely around their leader 
and their party.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk marking the 30th anniversary of Kim </F>
Chong-il's work at the Workers' Party of Korea, WPK: "The Dear 
Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is Our Destiny and the Fatherland's 
Destiny"] 
  [Text] The current times, when an acute struggle between 
socialism and imperialism, and progress and reaction is being 
waged, are seriously raising the question of the destiny of the 
popular masses, the country, and the nation in an international 
point of view. 
  In countries where socialism has been frustrated due to the 
antirevolutionary maneuvers of the imperialists and 
reactionaries, and where national sovereignties have been 
infringed upon, the popular masses are hovering between life and 
death, and the destinies of the countries and the nations are 
being miserably trampled upon. 
  Solving the question of the destiny of the popular masses, 
the country, and the nation is one of the historic tasks of the 
progressive people shrewdly presented by the last decade of the 
20th century. The significant question put forth by the 
current times has been most brilliantly solved in our country in 
which the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is being upheld high 
at the top of the party and revolution. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our people 
are singing the song "Without Comrade Kim Chong-il, the 
Fatherland Does Not Exist." I like the song. As the song's 
lyrics state: Without Comrade Kim Chong-il, you comrades and 
the socialist fatherland do not exist. It is his destiny, as 
well as the destiny of you comrades and the fatherland. 
  The great leader [widaehan suryong] of the working class is 
the one who plays the decisive role of pioneering the destiny of 
the people, the country, and the nation. The destiny of the 
people, the country, and the nation is pioneered, protected, and 
brilliantly elucidated by the leader [suryong]. 
  The great leader of the working class analyzes and 
integrates 
the independent demands and interests of the popular masses to 
found the guidance ideology of revolution and leads the 
activities of the popular masses to elevate the ideology in a 
unified manner. He makes the popular masses into a 
self-defending main force of history and revolution by making 
them conscious and organized, and enables them to pioneer a 
bright future for themselves, their descendants, the fatherland 
and nation as the true masters of their destinies. 
  The fact that the destiny of the people and the fatherland 
is 
brilliantly pioneered and blossomed only under the wise 
leadership of the leader [suryong] is a lofty truth proven by 
our revolutionary practices. Our people have become the 
proudest and most dignified people by upholding the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song at the fore of revolution. Our fatherland 
is shining brilliantly in the whole world as a strong 
independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist country. 
  The struggle to pioneer and elucidate the destiny of the 
people, the country, and the nation is a long-term struggle to 
be continued generation after generation. To win or lose the 
historic struggle depends on whether or not the leader 
[suryong], who first pioneered the revolutionary road, and the 
people's true leader [chidoja], who is endlessly loyal to the 
cause, are upheld at the top of the party and revolution. 
  To the people, the greatest misfortune is having a wrong 
leader [chidoja], and the greatest fortune is having the 
leadership of a wise leader [suryong]. 
  Shouldering the destiny of the fatherland and the nation all 
by himself, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great 
leader [widaehan yongdoja] who leads to victory the chuche 
revolutionary cause pioneered by the respected and beloved 
leader [suryong], and a benevolent father [chaaeroun oboi] who 
devotes his everything for the people. Thanks to the dear 
comrade leader, our people have a rewarding life today and a 
promising future tomorrow, as well as the glory and bright 
future of chuche-based Korea. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a genius of 
ideological theory who plainly enlightens the road of 
elucidating the destiny of our people and fatherland with 
extraordinary wisdom. The destiny of the people, the country, 
and the nation can only be pioneered and elucidated by a correct 
ideological theory. As a boat without a compass cannot 
correctly sail to its destination, the destiny of the people, 
the country, and the nation cannot be successfully pioneered 
without the guidance of a revolutionary ideological theory. 
  The only guidance for pioneering the destiny of the popular 
masses is the immortal chuche idea. Chuche idea, which is based 
on the philosophical principle that the master of one's destiny 
is oneself, and the power of pioneering one's destiny also lies 
in oneself, elucidates the most correct road for pioneering the 
destiny of the people, the country, and the nation. The dear 
comrade leader has formalized the respected and beloved leader's 
revolutionary ideology into an integrated system of chuche-based 
ideology, theory, and methods, and further deepened and 
developed the chuche idea in conformity with the demands of the 
current times and the development of revolution. 
  Developing and completing the great revolutionary theory 
of pioneering and elucidating the destiny of the popular masses 
by further enriching the chuche idea with new theories and 
contents, and deepening the idea on a full scope is the dear 
comrade leader's immortal historic achievement accumulated 
during pioneering and elucidating the destiny of the people, the 
country, and the nation. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja] who leads the struggle to elucidate the 
destiny of our people and fatherland to victory. 
  The struggle to pioneer and elucidate the destiny of the 
people, the country, and the nation is propelled by the 
spontaneous function and role of the main force of revolution. 
The main force of revolution, which is a united body of the 
leader [suryong], the party, and the masses, is the decisive 
force and the one directly in charge of pioneering the destiny 
of the people, the country, and the nation. Therefore, the 
leadership of the people's leader [chidoja] is significantly 
reflected by the way he gathers the main force of revolution and 
the way he enhances its role. 
  The leadership of the dear comrade leader, who leads the 
struggle to elucidate the destiny of our people and fatherland 
to victory, is wise because throughout the times, he has 
strengthened the main force of revolution and taken the question 
of enhancing the role of the main force as the fundamental task. 
  The dear comrade leader has strengthened and developed our 
party into an invincible and ever-victorious chuche-type 
revolutionary party, and firmly consolidated all the people 
around the party, thus making them into a powerful force of our 
revolution. He has also extraordinarily enhanced the role of 
the main force of our revolution by tightly combining the 
leadership of the party with the line of revolutionary masses 
and giving precedence to the human reform work and political 
work. 
  Because the party and the popular masses have firmly united 
as one to become the main force of revolution and the role of 
the main force has been enhanced, the great historic 
transformation of nature and society has been achieved, the 
dignity and honor of our fatherland and people have been proudly 
displayed, and our people's destiny has become more brilliant. 
This is another special historic achievement of the dear 
comrade leader for our party and revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a benevolent father 
[chaaeroun oboi] who endlessly cares about and loves the people, 
and devotes his everything for the people. The destiny of the 
people, the country, and the nation can only be blossomed in the 
bosom of a leader [yongdoja] who possesses the extraordinary 
wisdom of ideological theory and outstanding leadership, as well 
as an endlessly lofty virtue. 
  A lofty virtue of the people's leader [chidoja] eliminates 
the slightest shadow from the work and life of every member of 
society. It is also a fountain enabling the people to absolutely 
trust and follow the leader [yongdoja], wholly entrust their 
destiny to the bosom of the leader [yongdoja], and lead a 
rewarding life. 
  The dear comrade leader bears the highest loyalty toward the 
great leader, embraces revolutionary comrades and people of all 
walks of life in his benevolent bosom, and warmly takes care of 
their work and life. Thanks to the great labor and warm love of 
the dear comrade leader, who always involves himself with the 
people, shares joy and sorrow with them, and generously gives 
away everything for the people's happiness, the destiny of our 
people and fatherland is shining more brilliantly today. That 
is why all our people are upholding the dear comrade leader as 
the benevolent father and wholly entrusting their destinies and 
future to the comrade leader. 
  Indeed, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the symbol 
of 
victory of our fatherland and nation, and happiness and 
brilliant future of all our people. Upholding the dear comrade 
leader, who is matchless in terms of ideological and theoretical 
wisdom, leadership, and virtue and who is the great man of great 
men, is a rare fortune of our people and honor of the generation. 
  The future of our people and the socialist fatherland is 
even 
brighter upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is 
our destiny and the destiny of chuche-based socialist 
fatherland, high at the top of the party and revolution.

<F P=106> ["Great Feats of WPK in Achieving its Steel-like Unity and </F>
Cohesion" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The 30 years since the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il assumed leadership over the 
party work is a brilliant history of an illustrious leader who 
has performed immortal feats in the efforts to increase the 
might of the singlehearted unity of the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] in every way, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed article today 
on the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader began to lead the 
party. 
  It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "Our party achieved solid unity and cohesion a long time 
ago. 
Not resting content with this, however, it has continued to work 
hard to strengthen the single-hearted unity of the whole party 
around the leader, so that it maintains unbreakable unity and 
cohesion, without any vacillation even in the present complex 
situation." 
  Referring to immortal feats performed by the dear leader in 
the struggle to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the WPK in 
every way, the article notes: 
  Of primary importance in his great leadership feats is that 
he has made it possible to firmly defend the tradition of the 
proud singlehearted unity and glorify it through generations. 
  From the first days of his leadership over the chuche cause 
of building the party he has subordinated all the party work and 
activities entirely to the work for firmly defending and 
exalting the tradition of singlehearted unity established by the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song when he started the Korean 
revolution. 
  Today when many parties of the world which had boasted of 
their long history have collapsed, not defending the tradition 
of unity, the WPK is firmly defending the tradition of 
singlehearted unity established in the initial period of the 
revolution. Herein lies the distinguished greatness and wise 
leadership of the dear leader. 
  What holds an important place in his great leadership feats 
is that he put forward the slogan of modelling the whole party 
on the chuche idea and has victoriously organized and led the 
struggle for its realisation, thus turning the WPK into an 
unbreakable integrated whole of one ideology and purpose. Thus, 
the organisational and ideological might of the WPK has 
increased immensely and a new change has taken place in the 
ideological and moral traits of the party members. 
  Today the entire party members think and act in accordance 
with the party's ideology and purpose at any time and in any 
place with the firm stand and view that they know nothing but 
the chuche idea, the revolutionary idea of the party. 
  What holds a brilliant place in his immortal leadership 
feats 
is also that he has made the whole party an entity of loyalty 
and filial piety, which is pervaded by unfailing loyalty to the 
party and the leader, with his great benevolent politics. 
  Regarding the idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" 
as his maxim from his early years, he always firmly believes in 
his revolutionary soldiers and people and spares nothing for 
them. 
  What holds a brilliant place also in his great leadership 
feats is that he has made sure that the work for strengthening 
the unity and cohesion of the party was conducted in close 
combination with the struggle to effect a great upswing in all 
domains of the revolution and construction and, thus, its 
indestructible vitality was demonstrated powerfully in practice. 
  In particular, the dear leader has seen to it that the whole 
party and the entire people vigorously conducted mass movements. 
This is a great contribution made by him to further 
strengthening the might of unity and cohesion of the party and 
effecting revolutionary changes in socialist construction. 
  The immortal feats of the dear leader who has exalted the 
might of singlehearted unity of the WPK on the highest level 
with his extraordinary intelligence, tested leadership and 
popular politics of warm love and trust in only 30 years which 
can be regarded a moment in the long history of the 
revolutionary movement, will shine forever with the victorious 
advance of the Korean-style socialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Former Soviet Army 
surgeon Mikhail Shulman recently published an article headlined 
"Benevolent Politics of Comrade Kim Chong-il Is Eternal 
Cornerstone of Unity and Victory". 
  In a lengthy article with subtitles "`We Serve the People 
Exclusively'" and "Even if the Earth Is Broken", the author says 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is confidently leading the 
whole party, all the people and the entire Army to the victory 
of socialism with his spirit of devoted service to the people, 
distinguished leadership ability and iron faith and will. 
  Shulman, far above 80, visited Korea several times from 
August 1945 when Korea was liberated from the colonial rule of 
Japanese imperialism. 
  He says: 
  What I cannot forget any moment among many unforgettable 
things in my life is the great personality and outstanding 
leadership ability of Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the great leaders of the Korean people, and the 
brilliant looks of socialist Korea which is soaring imposingly 
above the clouds in the east. 
  Pointing to the superior health care system of Korea where 
doctors visit residents, before the patients come to them, 
everyone gets medical assistance without paying a penny, and is 
provided with all conditions for the promotion of health by the 
state, the author says: The noble human love, great human love 
of Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a panacea for the longevity 
of the people in good health. 
  He went on: 
  Korea which was a colonial agriculture country with backward 
economy for many years and, worse still, was reduced to ruins in 
a three-year war built solid foundations of an independent 
national economy diversely developed and equipped with modern 
technologies in a few years. This is a miracle and change which 
can be brought about only in Korea where everything serves the 
people and their strength is the driving force of social 
development. 
  The imperialists in the West are decrying the economy of 
Korea, alleging that it has gone bankrupt. But this is a 
sophism to mar the image of socialist Korea. 
  I fully grasped the greatness of the leader through the 
reality of Korea which is constantly developing politics, 
economy and culture with main emphasis on the ideological, 
material and cultural life of the people. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of the quality, 
personality and ability to make everything serve the people, 
believing them as heaven, is, indeed, a man for the people, the 
greatest of the great. 
  There were in history great men who earned fame with wisdom, 
famous generals who earned fame with martial arts and 
politicians who won popular sentiments with benevolence. But 
none of these great men can be equal to the great personality of 
Comrade Kim Chong-il with literary and military accomplishments, 
loyalty and filial duty, iron will and grit. 
  Socialism collapsed in some countries at present. But Korea 
is firmly defending socialism and winning victory after victory, 
smashing the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists. 
  Now the people of many countries question what is the secret 
that Korea, not a big country, is fighting the United States 
singlehanded and overwhelming it thoroughly at a time when even 
influential politicians cringe if the U.S. shout at them. 
  I clearly saw the source of the strength of the Korean 
people 
while visiting Korea. 
  The singlehearted unity of the party and the popular masses 
united rock-firm around Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander 
of the Korean People's Army, is the source of invincible might 
which can create something out of nothing and defeat any 
formidable enemy. 
  It is the distinguished merit of Comrade Kim Chong-il 
possessed of outstanding idea and theories and preeminent 
leadership ability that the singlehearted unity of Korea is so 
solid and virile as today. 
  The outstanding leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il in 
strengthening the working-class party, the general staff of the 
revolution, enhancing the leadership role of the party in every 
way, effecting a fundamental turn in the building of the 
revolutionary Armed Forces and fully displaying the advantages 
of socialism in economy, culture and all other domains has 
instilled deep into the hearts of the entire people the firm 
faith and will that when they uphold his leadership, they can 
surely occupy any fortress in socialist construction, drive back 
the counterrevolutionary offensive of all the enemies and always 
win victory. The singlehearted unity of Korea is so powerful 
because the whole society is overflowing with this faith and 
will. 
  What I want to stress as regards the singlehearted unity of 
Korea is that it is a crystal of benevolent politics, politics 
of love and trust of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The mighty unity of the entire people like the singlehearted 
unity of Korea can be achieved only by the strength of idea, the 
strength of politics and the strength of love of such 
illustrious leader as Comrade Kim Chong-il who enjoys undisputed 
trust of the people. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a country guided 
by the illustrious leader, where the people is the master of the 
state and society and the singlehearted unity of the entire 
people has been achieved, will further prosper, displaying its 
might to the whole world as a fortress of socialism and a beacon 
of the hope of mankind.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our Local Industry That Has Been </F>
Cosolidated Under The Party's Leadership"] 
  [Text] Functionaries in the local industry sector and 
people's consumer goods producers throughout the country are 
accelerating production amid high zeal, upholding the party's 
light-industry-first policy. They are filled with the firm 
determination to actively contribute to implementing the party's 
light-industry-first policy by effecting a new innovation in 
people's consumer goods production at a time when thirty years 
have passed since the dear comrade leader began to exercise his 
leadership in our party's work, and they are now further 
exerting themselves on the occasion of Local Industry Day [7 
June]. 
  On 7 June 1958, 36 years ago, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song published the historic work, "On Increasing People's 
Consumer Goods and Improving Commodity Circulation Work," and, 
thus, elucidated a brilliant future for the development of local 
industry. Since then, he has strengthened and developed our 
local industry, along with our large-scale central industry, 
into a mighty and powerful consumer goods production base which 
has greatly contributed to implementing the party's policy of 
carrying out the revolution in light industry. 
  Shining on the path of the rapid development of local 
industry is the immortal leadership achievement of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: 
Developing local industry is an important way of increasing 
production rapidly and improving the people's living. 
  The dear comrade leader, with his deep insight into the 
important position of local industry, has been deeply interested 
in its development. When he personally conducted on-the-spot 
guidance to local industry plants, the dear comrade leader not 
only gave detailed teachings to the matters on increasing 
quantities and kinds of consumer goods by mobilizing and using 
local reserves and potential to the maximum and on improving 
their quality, but also led functionaries and working people in 
this sector to the single road of victory. 
  In the summer of 1962, the dear comrade leader conducted an 
on-the-spot guidance to various local industry plants in Sakchu 
county. This became an occasion for a new turn in the 
development of our local industry. 
  Visiting Sakchu textile plant that day, the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il expressed satisfaction upon witnessing the 
appearance of the plant, where workers were working vigorously 
with modern equipment, and the cloth they produced, said with 
joy at a meeting with functionaries of the plant: In four 
years, the plant which started with a loom set in a room of 
another person's house has changed beyond recognition today. 
  He then stressed the need to produce more good-quality cloth 
by improving the level of technical provisions at local plants 
and fully mobilizing and utilizing locally available sources of 
raw materials. 
  The dear comrade leader also visited the Sakchu corn 
processing plant and there said that only when we build local 
industry plants with our own strength and develop technology 
rapidly will we make the country richer and the people better 
off. 
  Based on this deep understanding of the real situation in 
the 
Sakchu county and on his analysis of data, the dear comrade 
leader published the historic document, "The Position and Role 
of a Socialist Country's County," which is another brilliant 
milestone in developing local industry. 
  In August 1963, the dear comrade leader visited Pungsan, 
called the first village under the sky, and personally looked 
around a nameless food store in the town of Pungsan. On that 
day, he even personally tasted the soy sauce that is supplied to 
residents. He even provided detailed instructions on the method 
for producing more delicious soy sauce and bean paste. 
  In June 1990, four years ago, the dear comrade leader, in 
his 
historic letter to participants of the national meeting of light 
industry, set forth concrete tasks and methods to further 
develop local industry and to vigorously wage people's consumer 
goods production as a mass movement. Thus, he vigorously 
inspired functionaries and working people in the local industry 
sector into the revolution in light industry. 
  Recently the dear comrade leader has been providing us with 
constant love and care in order to provide our people with a 
happier and richer lives by more rapidly improving the standard 
of the people's living. 
  In an effort to repay the dear comrade leader's great love 
and care with loyalty, functionaries and working people in this 
sector have waged a vigorous struggle to produce various kinds 
of good-quality people's consumer goods by effectively utilizing 
the existing production capabilities and mobilizing locally 
available reserves and potential to the maximum. As a result of 
this, our local industry has made rapid development and is, 
accordingly, contributing greatly to smoothly meeting the 
ever-increasing people's demands for consumer goods. 
  Comrade Yi Kyong-yong from the General Department of 
Local Industry of North Pyongan Province says: 
  [Begin recording] Thanks to our party's chuche-oriented 
policy of simultaneouly developing central and local industry, 
our North Pyongan Province has made rapid progress in local 
industry. Local industry plants with modern production 
facilities have been built everywhere in our province today, 
including Changsong and Paetong, which were treated as remote 
and secluded areas in the past. 
  These local industry plants in our province have produced 
great quantities of various kinds of consumer goods with good 
quality in order to make our people's living more civilized and 
affluent. 
  Indeed, our industry which started from scratch, is today 
demonstrating its appearance as a chuche-oriented industry which 
can manufacture everything. This is indeed a great change. 
  This great change and great success on this land, is the 
brilliant result of the great leader's wise leadership and the 
dear comrade leader's energetic guidance. [end recording] 
  Functionaries and working people who work and live in 
Sakchu, 
the glorious land, where the dear comrade leader's immortal 
achievements dwell, are effecting constant innovation in 
building a raw material base and in modernizing local industry 
with the burning determination to effect greater success in 
developing local industry. 
  All counties in North Pyongan Province, including Changsong 
county, Chongju county, and Kwaksan county, have each built a 
200-chongbo base for raw material cultivation as demanded by the 
party and are producing various kinds of people's consumer goods 
based on the base. 
  Counties in South Pyongan Province, including Yangdok county 
and Sinyang county, have collected great quantities of wild 
fruit, wild berries, and wild vegetables for developing local 
industry. 
  In addition, cities and counties like Huichon city and 
Chonchon county of Chagang Province, Kim Chong-suk county and 
Paekam county of Yanggang Province, and Pujon county of South 
Hamgyong Province, have constantly developed local industry by 
properly utilizing the specific situation of the regions. 
  These cities and counties have been developing their local 
industry by building medium- and small-type power plants and 
other numerous local industry plants, including chemical plants 
and caustic soda plants, everywhere. 
  Functionaries and working people in the local industry 
sector 
have registered great success in their struggle to modernize 
local industry, too. 
  Today, functionaries and working people in the local

<F P=106> [By reporter Kim Hui-yong] </F>
  [Excerpts] When we visit the wide rice fields of the 
cooperative farms in Unchon county, which is seething with the 
work to carry out rice transplanting to achieve a bumper crop, 
by highly upholding the party's militant call, we can see scenes 
attracting the people's curiosity. 
  All the farms in this county use substitute fuel, which they 
themselves produced, to operate tractors, rice seedling pullers, 
and rice seedling transplanters to harrow rice fields, pull rice 
seedlings, and carry out rice transplanting. 
  When passing through Sinchang, Namsan, and Songbong 
cooperative farms to go to Yangdam cooperative farm, we were 
able to see farmers joyously pull rice seedlings and carry out 
rice transplanting using gas as fuel produced on the farms by 
themselves. While guaranteeing a full operation and full 
capacity of rice seedling pullers and rice seedling 
transplanters by using gas as fuel, about 7 to 8 percent of all 
the rice paddies are being transplanted every day in the county. 
Therefore, rice transplanting on the basic area of rice paddies 
has already been finished in the county. [passage omitted] 
  The functionaries of the county maintained model bases 
producing substitute fuels in the plants in the county, and with 
the substitute fuel produced here, they showed that they are 
able to operate tractors, trucks, rice seedling transplanters, 
and rice seedling pullers as much as they want. Therefore, 
cooperative farms in the county maintained bases that produce 
substitute fuel in accordance with the actual circumstances. 
The functionaries of the county went into the cooperative farms 
and solved technological problems arising in maintaining the 
substitute fuel production bases and actively helped the 
cooperative farms to quickly build the production bases. 
  Therefore, plants, enterprises, and cooperative farms in the 
county started to produce substitute fuel from late last year. 
[passage omitted] 
  A functionary of the county whom we met at the rice 
transplanting battle field at the third work team of the Yangdam 
cooperative farm said that there were many good points in 
carrying out rice transplanting by using the substitute fuel. 
  If rice seedling transplanting is carried out with machines 
using substitute fuel, much oil can be saved. Cooperative farms 
in this county harrow rice fields, remove the young rice plants 
from the seedbeds, and transplant rice by using the substitute 
fuel, thus a large amount of oil is being saved. 
  Another good point is that if gas, the substitute fuel, is 
used in rice seedling transplanters and rice seedling pullers, 
the machines start easily, thus the expected rate of its 
operation can be enhanced greatly. Experiences by the 
cooperative farms in this county show that if the functionaries 
use their wit and make efforts to fulfill the party policy, and 
mobilize the plentiful source, substitute fuel can be produced 
ever so much and thus enhance the rate of operation of the 
agricultural machines. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Phnom Penh 11 Jun (AKP) -- Prince Norodom Sirivut, 
deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs and 
international cooperation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, returned 
to Phnom Penh on 9 June after a month-long tour, from May 7th 
onward, of France and EC countries. 
  On his return to Phnom Penh he said that "foreign military 
aid to the government army to fight Khmer Rouge rebels will 
bring stability but will not affect the peace process in the 
country." 
  In the meantime, Prince Norodom Sirivut attended the 11th 
conference of nonaligned countries, held from 31 May to 3 June, 
in Cairo (Egypt). During his stay in France he specified that 
he had asked for French aid for the Cambodian Army. "When we 
asked for military assistance, it was not that we wanted to 
aggravate the situation; we want stability," added Prince 
Norodom Sirivut. 
  Australia, France, and the United States are discussing the 
request to train and equip some 160,000 government combatants. 
The Khmer Rouge have vigorously condemned all foreign aid. 
  Prince Norodom Sirivut reaffirmed that the royal government 
does not however want to continue the war against the rebels. 
According to him, the government and Cambodia's king, His 
Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, are trying to bring the guerrillas 
into the national community. 
  Cambodia's chief diplomat also pointed out that he has 
received a 10-point proposal from the Thai Army aimed at 
settling border problems between the two countries. 
  "I am very happy to hear about this proposal from the Thai 
Army; it is a good proposal; I appreciate it," said the prince 
without giving further details.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 13 (ANTARA) -- The three-day air 
defence exercise dubbed "Cakra A/94" involving F-5E Tiger II and 
A-4 Sky Hawk tactical jet aircraft, wound up in Jakarta Friday 
last week. 
  National Air Defence Command (Kohanudnas) spokesman 
Lieutenant Colonel Widoso Sabarno said in Jakarta Monday that 
the exercise took place in the air territory under the Air 
Defence Sector Command I [Roman numeral one] covering Jakarta 
and its surroundings. 
  Also taking part in the event, he added, were a number of 
C-130 Hercules giant transport planes and Boeing 707 aircraft, 
in addition to radar units, with Flight Lieutenant Colonel Tahir 
Harita in charge of control and supervision. 
  Widoso said the main purpose of the exercise was to enhance 
the combat readiness of the air defence potential of the 
particular region. 
  The ability and preparedness in the detection, control, and 
interception of enemy aircraft under the air defence operation 
procedures and control command mechanism, have really been 
tested during the exercise, he said. 
  The exercise was also to train combat pilots in quick 
reaction, target identification, action against a target 
including cashing [as received] away, forcing to land up to 
shooting down, Widoso said. 
  In the exercise, the A-4 Sky Hawks acted as the enemy, 
flying 
from their base in Pekanbaru, Riau, for penetration to Jakarta. 
  The A-4 jets were detected by ground radar, then `met' by 
the 
F-5 combat planes, and eventually chased away. 
  The exercise was officially closed by Kohanudnas Commander 
Rear Marshal Sujitno.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Abbugao] </F>
  [Text] Manila, June 14 (AFP) -- The Philippines' frenzied 
search for oil has led it into potentially dangerous waters with 
the grant of an exploration contract around the disputed Spratly 
islands, analysts said here Tuesday. 
  Philippine officials in May gave the green light to Alcorn 
Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and US partner Vaalco Energy Inc. 
of Houston, to begin preliminary exploration work on the Reed 
Bank, an undersea structure near the South China Sea chain. 
  The six-month, non-exclusive contract includes "research and 
library work" on aeromagnetic surveys and other data held by the 
Department of Energy. 
  Philippine energy officials insist the area where the 
exploration would be conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a 
chain of atolls in the South China Sea claimed wholly by China 
and in part by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and 
Vietnam. 
  The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil 
and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. All 
claimants but Brunei have stationed troops on islets in the 
chain. 
  Analysts say Manila's recent move would strengthen its 
sovereignty over islets, reefs and atolls it has garrisoned, but 
could also have a political and diplomatic impact on efforts to 
peacefully resolve the territorial dispute and suggestions for 
joint development of the area. 
  "It's a response to what the Chinese and Malaysians are 
doing," Julius Cesar Parrenas, director of the International 
Institute for Strategic Studies, told AFP. 
  He was referring to Beijing's granting of a contract to the 
US-based Crestone Energy Corp. to explore for oil in the area, 
prompting vehement protests from Vietnam. Malaysia has also 
embarked on a project to develop a resort in the Spratlys. 
  "One means of strengthening sovereignty is by already having 
activity there, such as a contract of government or development 
plans," he said, adding that exploration was a good move by the 
Philippines. 
  Noel Morada, an analyst with the Institute for Strategic and 
Development Studies, said what is crucial to the Philippines' 
move is the reaction of China and Vietnam. 
  "Since we are taking this particular action, we should be 
prepared of the possible consequences," he said. "This is an 
economic move which has political implications." 
  Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro and Undersecretary Rufino 
Bomasang on Tuesday sought to forestall trouble by insisting the 
permit granted to Alcorn was limited to the Reed Bank and did 
not include areas in the Spratlys. 
  The Reed Bank is an underwater structure between the 
Philippine island of Palawan and most of the Spratlys. 
  Lazaro and Bomasang said Manila had done exploratory 
drilling 
there in the 1970s, which had not been disputed by other 
claimants, adding that political and diplomatic repurcussions 
had been considered before the permit was granted. 
  Alcorn said in a statement the research permit only covered 
the Reed Bank and excluded the disputed areas of the Spratlys. 
  But the statement said the area of coverage also includes 
Patag and Lawak islands -- two of the eight small islands and 
reefs garrisoned by Philippine marines and collectively referred 
to by Manila as the Kalayaan (Freedom) group. 
  The group was annexed in a presidential decree by the late 
dictator Ferdinand Marcos. 
  The Philippines has become an attractive site for oil 
exploration with news of recent oil strikes off Palawan, 
confirming the country's potential. It has programmed 18 wells 
for drilling this year, many in frontier areas.

  [Text] Negotiations on the automobile and automobile parts 
sector in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks have been 
stalling as negotiators have failed to start discussions on core 
matters, such as defining objective criteria for gauging the 
openness of Japanese markets to foreign access. Division chiefs 
participated in experts' meetings which began in Tokyo on 13 
June, but not much progress seems to have been made there. U.S. 
negotiators have started spreading word regarding their view 
that "an agreement on the automobiles talks will be set back 
until the (July Naples) summit or later" (as stated by Walter 
Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan). Some officials of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], who are in 
charge of the trade negotiations, have expressed impatience, 
saying: "Trade talks on the automobiles sector may be settled at 
a later time than talks on other priority areas such as 
government procurement and insurance." 
  Ever since the framework trade talks were resumed, 
negotiations on the automobiles sector have been continued 
energetically. Division chiefs held meetings on 2-3 June, and 
sub-cabinet level talks were held on 10-11 June. Division 
chiefs met again this week. 
  Despite all that has been going on, not much progress seems 
to have been made in the talks because negotiators have been 
unable to hold in-depth discussions regarding objective 
criteria, which is a key issue in the talks. At the sub-cabinet 
level meetings held late last week, Japanese and U.S. 
negotiators considered draft accords proposed by each side as a 
springboard for discussions. However, it is said that the 
negotiators have "failed to go as far as to be able to merge 
them [the proposed draft accords]" (as stated by a top MITI 
official). Another reason for the lack of progress in the trade 
talks is that "U.S. negotiators have become cautious, fearing 
that the trade talks may break down" (as stated by the same MITI 
official). 
  In the backdrop of U.S. negotiators' lingering with the 
talks, there is a view arising in some quarters of the Japanese 
Government that "U.S. industrial circles are pressuring the U.S. 
Government to be more patient so that greater concessions can be 
drawn out from Japan" (as stated by a government source). This 
could be considered an advanced U.S. tactic aimed at irritating 
Japan, and Japanese negotiators may thus find it difficult to 
respond to the situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Heated Exchange Inevitable Over </F>
Objective Criteria"] 
  [Text] Japan and the United States will hold vice 
ministerial negotiations on automobiles and auto parts beginning 
10 June in Tokyo under the resumed Japanese-U.S. economic 
framework talks. Working-level negotiations on the three 
priority sectors of automobiles, government procurement, and 
insurance were held with division-chief-level officials from the 
two countries in attendance prior to the vice ministerial 
negotiations, but the working-level negotiations ended after 
both sides only exchanged views on their differences. 
"Objective criteria" have been the focus of contention in the 
Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, and the two countries 
have just started a full-fledged discussion of them. While some 
officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] say, "We intend to seek a settlement on all three 
priority sectors prior to the summit talks of major 
industrialized nations (the Naples summit) scheduled for July," 
the U.S. side is taking a wary attitude toward settling the 
three priority sectors, saying, "There is a possibility of the 
two countries agreeing on only part of them." 
  At the outset of the working-level negotiations on 
automobiles, which were held in the Foreign Ministry on 3 June 
with division- chief-level officials from the two countries, the 
U.S. side said, "Let us not take up the quantitative criteria 
for discussion at these negotiations." The quantitative 
criteria may lead to a numerical target depending on how the 
"objective criteria" are handled in the future. The U.S. side 
wanted to put off discussing the quantitative criteria. 
<H5>  Hard To Fathom Real Intent </H5>
  At the working-level negotiations on automobiles, both 
Japanese and U.S. officials almost completed the discussion of 
qualitative criteria. They made a certain headway by agreeing 
to adopt a criterion to measure progress in the improvement of 
bidding procedures, but they agreed to put off discussing the 
quantitative criteria to mid-June until after the second round 
of the vice ministerial negotiations. In late May, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor asked Japan to increase the number 
of car dealers selling foreign automobiles as an example of the 
objective criteria to measure the sales of foreign automobiles 
and auto parts in Japan, claiming, "Japan is supposed to promise 
to increase the number of car dealers selling foreign-built 
automobiles." His remark was tantamount to denying Japan's view 
that "The United States will not seek to set any numerical 
targets." 
  A senior MITI official, for whom it seems hard to fathom the 
United States' true intentions, asks: "What do stores dealing 
in foreign cars mean after all? Do they mean car dealers 
selling foreign cars or dealerships selling foreign cars 
exclusively?" The handling of the objective criteria, including 
the definition of car dealers, will inevitably become a focal 
point at the vice ministerial negotiations that will be held 
between Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten and MITI 
Deputy Minister Okamatsu for two days beginning 10 June. 
  The Japanese side has raised an objection to adopting the 
objective criteria to gauge the amount of auto parts imported by 
Japan, the number of U.S.-built right-hand-drive automobiles 
sold on the Japanese vehicle market, and the number of finished 
automobiles imported by Japan. The United States plans to 
propose that both Japan and the United States jointly assess 
these twice a year. The United States, however, may assert that 
the objective criteria should be set in a way that the number of 
car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles in Japan will 
increase visibly. 
<H5>  NTT Is the Obstacle </H5>
  Another set of working-level negotiations on the insurance 
sector have only confirmed areas of agreement and differences 
but included no in-depth discussion of how the objective 
criteria should be set for that sector. At issue is how to 
treat foreign insurance companies that are expected to suffer 
financially by the deregulation of the third sector, in terms of 
insurance for safety custody [kaigo], injury, and disease. A 
Japanese negotiator anticipates rough sailing at the future 
negotiations, saying, "We do not necessarily need to reach an 
agreement with the U.S. side on the insurance sector prior to 
the Naples summit." 
  Both Japan and the United States share the common view that 
"they must avoid creating a situation wherein the upcoming 
Japanese-U.S. summit talks are broken off again by settling 
first the insurance and automobile sectors out of the three 
priority sectors." In February, the two countries agreed 90 
percent on the issue of government procurement (according to a 
Japanese Government source). The handling of the Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) issue is an obstacle 
to concluding the government procurement talks. The U.S. side 
has insisted that the NTT's procurement of communications 
equipment be taken up for discussion at the framework talks. In 
response, the Japanese side has rejected the U.S. side's demand, 
arguing, "It is improper for the framework talks to discuss 
procurement by a company that has been privatized." In this 
way, the two sides have confronted each other over NTT's 
procurement of communications equipment. 
  NTT is set to take the lead in building the next-generation 
communications network in which Japan is expected to make a 
massive investment. This prospect has prompted the U.S. side to 
make its demand. The Japanese side intends to seek the 
understanding of the U.S. side by proposing that another set of 
bilateral negotiations be held to discuss the issue of NTT's 
procurement practices. 
<H5>  MITI Eager To Speed Up Negotiations </H5>
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is mindful of 
the subtle differences in the progress achieved in the 
individual sector-by-sector negotiations, has indicated the 
prospect that "Japan and the United States will reach a partial 
agreement at the upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit talks." The 
negotiations on the automobile sector have lagged behind those 
on the other sectors. MITI and other relevant ministries, who 
are concerned by the possibility that "the two countries may put 
off reaching an agreement on the automobile sector, which has 
been taken as a symbol of Japanese-U.S. trade frictions," aim to 
settle matters in all three sectors. If Japan is too hasty in 
wanting to reach an agreement on the automobile sector, it will 
then have to make extensive concessions to do so. While the 
Japanese automobile industry is paying attention to the 
negotiations, the two countries have only one month before the 
Naples summit is held.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "US Drags Its Feet as Ethnic Madness Grips </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Text] After months of dithering over what to do about the 
orgy of tribal bloodletting in Rwanda, the United Nations 
finally gave the go-ahead late Wednesday for the deployment of 
5,500 peacekeepers to guard aid convoys and protect civilians in 
special humanitarian zones inside the country. 
  Almost immediately, the governments of Ghana and Zimbabwe 
announced they were ready to deploy troops but the United States 
says it will be weeks before it can send long-promised 
equipment. This delay is intolerable. Each day that help fails 
to arrive, more Rwandans are being slaughtered and the food and 
health crisis gripping the country worsens. 
  On Friday, the head of the UN operation in Rwanda, General 
Romeo Dallaire said the deployment of more UN reinforcements was 
"already weeks late." 
<H5>  Priests massacred </H5>
  He said that he had been receiving desperate calls for help 
daily, including one from the archbishop of Kigali before he and 
other 12 priests were massacred last week. But with few troops 
and limited equipment, the general said he was powerless to save 
them from death squads. 
  Estimates of the number of people butchered in the small 
African state range from 200,000 to half a million but even 
these horrific figures may be under-representing the scope of 
the mayhem in the country. 
  In the black hole of government-held land to the west of the 
country, where Hutu death squads are continuing their rampage 
against the minority Tutsis, about two million refugees have 
"vanished." Aid groups which expected them to pour across the 
border into Burundi say they have simply not turned up. 
  Washington must take much of the blame for the tardiness of 
UN action. It repeatedly blocked earlier efforts to deploy UN 
peacekeepers, demanding that a ceasefire be agreed first. 
  The U.S. position sought to restrict the reinforcements to 
operating on border areas. The new resolution allows the mainly 
African extra peacekeepers to go to the capital Kigali, if 
possible, and fan out through the country to places where 
civilians are most at risk. 
  Washington's position has shown an appalling disregard for 
the lives of Rwandans. 
  Even as late as Friday, the White House was still trying to 
avoid categorizing the Rwanda killings as genocide out of fear 
the term might incite public calls for greater U.S. action. 
  A State Department spokeswoman told a disbelieving press 
conference: "Clearly not all of the killings that have taken 
place in Rwanda are killings to which you might apply that label 
(genocide)." 
<H5>  Slashing and hacking </H5>
  How the Clinton administration can classify the slashing and 
hacking of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis to death as anything 
but genocide is bewildering. 
  Nearly two million Tutsis, including an estimated 500,000 
unaccompanied children whose parents have either been killed or 
lost, are displaced and thousands are trapped in hostile zones 
under the constant fear of death. 
  UN officials says they are starting to see children in 
Kigali 
with bloated bellies, an early sign of starvation. 
Hunger-related deaths have already been reported in the south. 
  It is imperative that the US waste no more time in 
dispatching the equipment the UN needs to restrain the ethnic 
madness in Rwanda. 
  Washington must also bring whatever diplomatic pressure it 
can on Uganda, the main backer of the predominantly-Tutsi Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF). Unless the RPF halts their offensive and 
agrees to a ceasefire, it will be difficult for the UN to make 
arrangements for the care of refugees.

  [Text] Hanoi, June 14 (AFP) -- Vietnam has resolved its 
main problems with the United States, especially the issue of US 
troops missing in action (MIA) from the Vietnam War, which 
dogged relations for nearly 20 years, Communist Party General 
Secretary Do Muoi said. 
  In an interview with AFP on Monday, Do Muoi said the 2,231 
MIAs were a "humanitarian" issue that had been settled, although 
it was "still an internal problem in the United States." 
  "We are acting in good faith," he said, referring to 
Vietnamese help in the effort to discern the fate of the missing 
troops. 
  The United States on February 3 scrapped an embargo on trade 
with Vietnam that had been set in place to press Hanoi on the 
MIAs. The move was followed in May by a mutual decision to set 
up liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington -- the first step 
towards restoring full diplomatic ties. 
  Do Muoi said he did not rule out an historic first visit to 
Vietnam by a US secretary of state in the near future. Warren 
Christopher is to go to Bangkok next month for a meeting of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and US press 
reports say he may stop off in Vietnam before or after the visit. 
  "He can come when he feels like it," Do Muoi said. 
  US-Vietnamese trade has surged since the end of the trade 
embargo. The deals include a contract with the US oil giant 
Mobil for exploring offshore oil sites, as well as the sale of 
100,000 tonnes of rice for the US market. 
  Turning to regional issues, Do Muoi said he was "concerned" 
at the Korean nuclear crisis, the situation in Cambodia and the 
friction between Vietnam and China over sovereignty in the South 
China Sea. 
  Vietnamese Defence Minister General Doan Khue left Hanoi 
Monday on the first official visit to Pyongyang by a ranking 
Vietnamese military chief in 19 years. 
  The visit, Do Muoi said, was purely on a "friendship basis" 
and had no link with rumours that Khue would press the North 
Koreans over their nuclear programme. 
  "We've got other things to worry about," he said, adding 
that 
Vietnam had no intention of selling arms or ammunition to North 
Korea. 
  Do Muoi repeatedly emphasised Vietnam was only interested in 
peace after years of war, and intended to widen and strengthen 
its ties with the rest of the world, as its wish to join the 
Association of South East Asian nations "sooner or later" 
demonstrated. 
  He attacked a Chinese contract with a US oil company, 
Crestone, for drilling rights near the disputed Spratly Islands, 
but said disputes of this kind should be resolved by "patient 
negotiations," although insisted that the Spratlys and the 
Parcels in the South China Sea "are ours."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton discussed over the phone Tuesday 
North Korea's reported decision to pull out from the United 
Nations' nuclear watchdog, Japanese officials said. 
  The conversation, which lasted about 18 minutes, followed 
Pyongyang's announcement Monday that it has decided to withdraw 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) due to 
"unreasonable sanctions" imposed by the agency. 
  The punitive action was taken for North Korea's rejection of 
inspections of its nuclear facilities suspected of being used 
for nuclear arms development. 
  The Vienna-based IAEA says it has not received any word from 
Pyongyang about the reported move.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 13 Jun -- Mongolia, which advocates a 
ban on nuclear weapons testing, condemns the nuclear explosion 
conducted by China on the Lobnor test range in the autonomous 
province of Xingjiang Uighur on 10 June, an official statement 
by a spokesman of the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Relations 
says. 
  This step taken by China, which contradicts international 
agreements aimed at reaching a comprehensive ban on nuclear 
weapons testing and has a negative effect on this process, 
arouses concern and regret, the statement declares. 
  Mongolia hopes that the PRC will not ignore the peace-loving 
efforts of other nuclear powers and will stop its nuclear 
testing.

  [Text] Berlin, June 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, which 
announced it would quit the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) on Monday, has yet to officially notify the agency of the 
decision, IAEA officials said. 
  In addition, Pyongyang has not sent written notification to 
the United States, the depository country for the IAEA 
statitutes. 
  North Korea's withdrawal does not take effect according to 
international law unless the country sends written notification 
to the United States and then the IAEA Secretariat gives an 
authoritative interpretation to effect this notification. 
  But since North Korea's nuclear safeguards agreement holds 
unless it leaves the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), its 
announced withdrawal from the IAEA carries symbolic meaning of 
defying the IAEA sanctions resolution rather than any practical 
significance. 
  The IAEA Board of Governors passed a sanctions resolution 
against North Korea on Friday with overwhelming support. The 
resolution provides for an immediate halt to IAEA technical 
assistance totaling 500,000-600,000 dollars a year to Pyongyang. 
  The agency is studying North Korea's reason for announcing 
its withdrawal and will monitor the stalinist state's follow-up 
steps. 
  The North has apparently not restricted the activities of 
the 
IAEA inspection team currently in Yongbyon, but is likely to act 
soon after announcing it can no longer guarantee the continuity 
of nuclear safeguards, according to IAEA officials.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 14 June on 
North Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 1 a 1,600-word 
report on the movement of the ROK Government, the United States, 
the IAEA, and China in the face of North Korea's withdrawal from 
the IAEA, writing they are all agonizing over mapping out 
countermeasures. The report notes that the North Korean nuclear 
issue is at the edge of a cliff, while noting that the ROK 
Government confirmed again its stance of pushing for UN 
imposition of sanctions against North Korea by convening an 
emergency meeting of the Unification-National Security 
Coordination Council on 14 June. The report continues: "Because 
North Korea has not withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, NPT, a mother law of the IAEA, it still has a legal duty 
to undergo inspections of its nuclear facilities. In case North 
Korea should reject the inspections and order inspectors to 
leave, a process for international inspection of North Korea's 
nuclear activities will completely disappear, thereby greatly 
shocking the international community. North Korea's nuclear 
issue will surely bring about long-term consequences, depending 
upon the international community's response." 
  The report quotes Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and 
minister of the National Unification Board, as saying after the 
14 June Unification-National Security Coordination Council 
meeting that North Korea's breaking away from all safety devices 
guaranteeing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is 
decisively running counter to the peaceful solution of the 
nuclear issue, while urging North Korea to cooperate to secure 
all safety measures as required by the NPT system. The report 
further quotes Minister Yi as stressing that there is no 
peculiar military activity on North Korea's part, while noting 
the government will continue to make solid and consistent 
efforts for the peaceful solution of the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,200-word article on 
the reaction of the ROK Government. The article quotes 
participants in the 14 June Unification-National Security 
Coordination Council meeting as analyzing that North Korea's 
withdrawal from the IAEA was carried out to emphasize its 
threats that if the IAEA imposes sanctions, it will withdraw 
from the NPT; and if the UN Security Council decides on 
sanctions, it will regard this as a declaration of war. 
Government officials concerned are quoted as saying that North 
Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA is a low-level measure--one 
step lower than withdrawal from the NPT--to secure as many 
bargaining chips as possible; not to abruptly escalate the 
intensity of confrontation; not to yield to the pressure of 
sanctions; and to hold in check sanctions by the UN Security 
Council. The article comments: Considering that North Korea's 
latest move is aimed at testing our government's will, the ROK 
Government has decided to react strongly. 
  The article reports that it will be easier for the ROK 
Government and the United States to persuade China and other 
neighboring nations to deal with North Korea's nuclear issue, 
predicting that China and Russia will be able to exercise 
stronger influence and North Korea's nuclear issue will be 
discussed at a forum other than the United Nations. The article 
concludes that the government is concentrating its efforts on 
mapping out security countermeasures against North Korea's 
possible provocations. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial 
on the dangerous nature of North Korea's withdrawal from the 
IAEA, noting that North Korea's diplomacy is moving toward an 
extremely dangerous all-or-nothing stage. The editorial 
comments that North Korea has two goals: One, North Korea will 
deal only with the United States to the exclusion of the IAEA; 
two, North Korea is trying to drive a wedge in the international 
community's discussion of the imposition of sanctions. The 
editorial concludes that North Korea is trying to achieve a 
dramatic effect with the approach of the upcoming visit by 
former U.S. President Carter and urges North Korea to understand 
that the United States is not so easy and that if its excessive 
strategy fails, there will be a larger danger. 
  The moderate, culturally oriented MUNHWA ILBO carries on 
page 
1 an article on ROK and U.S. reactions. The article predicts 
that as a result of the increasing mistrust of North Korea, 
discussion at the UN Security Council will proceed more quickly, 
while noting the ROK and the United States have reaffirmed their 
position to push for the UN Security Council's imposition of 
phased sanctions on North Korea. 
  MUNHWA ILBO also carries on page 1 an article on Pyongyang's 
ulterior motives. The article reports that Pyongyang is trying 
to realize direct negotiations with the United States, while 
noting that in the eyes of North Korea, the IAEA is nothing but 
an obstacle to its negotiations with the United States. The 
article continues that North Korea did not withdraw from the 
NPT, reporting this means that North Korea is not preparing for 
a face-to-face confrontation with the United States, but shows 
that it has not given up its nuclear diplomacy through 
negotiations.

war-thirsty elements on June 9 staged a massive combined 
air-ground-sea war exercise against the North in the southern 
area of East Coast by mobilizing destroyers, Naval planes and 
Airforce planes of the puppet Army, according to a radio report 
from Seoul. 
  The drill for "increasing the capacity of combined 
operations" shows that the puppets are running [words 
indistinct] the train of war against the North, taking issue 
with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North.

<F P=106> ["Stop Acting Recklessly"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- At "a meeting of the 
National Security Council" on June 8, the traitor Kim Yong-sam, 
talking about "damage" of the "North's nuclear transparency", 
said "sanctions of the international community is inevitable" 
and pressed home the need to "promote sanctions against the 
North". 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  Kim Yong-sam, who had incited North-South confrontation with 
the bellicose remarks that "a military reaction will not be 
ruled out" over the North's "nuclear issue", is now displaying 
feverish activities for "sanctions against the North" in a bid 
to harm the fellow countrymen by joining hands with outside 
forces. This shows that Kim Yong-sam's is a group of traitors 
who have no regard for the country and the nation, for peace and 
peaceful reunification of the country. 
  It is the height of folly for Kim Yong-sam to think he can 
go 
scotfree after getting "sanctions" taken against the fellow 
countrymen through conspiracy with outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group's attempt to do harm to the fellow 
countrymen, dancing to the tune of outside forces without 
independence, is an act of self-destruction that reminds us of a 
rabid dog barking into the sky, without any knowledge of its 
imminent death. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must stop acting rashly, 
clearly mindful that neither Uncle Sam nor Patriot missiles can 
protect them. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst warns that the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
should not babble about "sanctions" like a mad dog barking at 
the moon, not knowing its doom, but ponder over the consequences 
that would arise therefrom and stop acting rashly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) 
[SKNDF] made public a detailed report on the crisis of the South 
Korean economy which is getting all the more serious amidst 
apprehensions of war growing because of the intensifying new war 
provocation moves of the United States and the Kim Yong-sam 
group and the increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula, 
according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. 
  The export-oriented economy of South Korea, a colony 
dependent on foreign capital and wriggling in a bog of the 
crisis of stagnation, has begun to shake to its very foundation 
due to the instability of the situation, the report said, and 
went on: 
  First of all, foreign capital investment in South Korea has 
dwindled and phenomena of its withdrawal increased as the 
apprehensions of war heightened. 
  According to data, foreign businesses took 610 million 
dollars out of South Korea in March and 490 million dollars in 
April. 
  South Korean stock prices dropped sharply. Foreign 
businesses now are more interested in selling stocks en masse 
than buying them in the South Korean stock market as the rumor 
of war spread. They took away 114.2 million dollars in the 
period from March 1 to 8. Subsequently, the South Korean 
securities market prices slumped. 
  The issue of securities has almort come to a suspension as 
the prices of securities of South Korean businesses rapidly 
dropped in external securities markets, too, owing to the 
perceived crisis of war. 
  An increasing number of flight of capital have been 
witnessed among the rich since the rumour of "crisis of a war in 
July or August" by the United States and the Kim Yong-sam 
belligerent group was set afloat from the beginning of the year. 
  According to the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation February 
26, 
the number of those who left South Korea when the situation was 
tense totalled over 427,300 till February 19, or 107,000 more 
than in the same period last year. They have secured their 
fabulous property through the purchase of houses and immovables, 
depositing, etc. abroad. 
  Foreign exporters are hesitating to ship export goods to 
South Korea because of the unstable South Korean situation 
caused by the rumour of a crisis of war. 
  In addition, the rich are reluctant to invest and do not 
deposit money in banks, with the result that colossal funds 
accounting for 40 percent of the gross national product are kept 
idle. 
  Thus, the withdrawal of foreign capital, paralyzed 
securities 
market, flight on capital, thriving underground economy and 
other phenomena caused by the crisis of war are driving the 
South Korean economy to the worst phase.

<F P=106> [Report by Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 15 (AFP) -- A new round of peace 
talks between the Cambodian government and the radical Khmer 
Rouge guerrillas adjourned here Wednesday, and government 
officials were almost unanimously pessimistic about the outcome. 
  In his opening address, King Norodom Sihanouk's 
representative, Nhoek Chulong, who is hosting the talks at the 
city's Royal Palace, warned that if the two sides failed to 
reach a positive result the king would refuse to call for any 
further sessions. 
  But despite this, the morning meeting broke up with the two 
sides failing to reach an agreement on a proposed ceasefire. 
  "We will continue tomorrow," Mak Ben, who often serves as 
the 
Khmer Rouge's spokesman, said as he left the palace. 
  Nhoek Chulong stressed the king's request for a simple "yes 
or no" answer to the ceasefire proposal. 
  The government side, which also consisted of Cabinet 
Minister 
Sok An and parliament representative Toh Loah, agreed to the 
ceasefire and suggested a starting date of June 30. 
  In a statement released to the press, senior Khmer Rouge 
delegate and former ambassador to China Chan Youran said the 
Khmer Rouge "were most delighted to have a ceasefire" and that 
it should be strictly controlled by a "committee or technical 
group." 
  But he refused to give a simple "yes or no" answer. 
  "I think the Khmer Rouge still do not agree to the ceasefire 
schedule proposal," Sok An said. 
  Senior government representative and Interior Minister Yu 
Hokkri echoed the sentiments of most of his colleagues when he 
said he was "not at all optimistic" about the eventual outcome 
but was going along with the talks in accordance with the king's 
wishes. 
  The Khmer Rouge, who control some 10 to 15 per cent of the 
country, boycotted last year's UN-supervised polls and have 
since continued a guerrilla struggle against the government 
installed by the polls. 
  The talks follow a previous unsuccessful round hosted by the 
king at his residence in North Korea last month. 
  On the agenda for Thursday's session is the even more 
problematic issue of the king's proposal for political 
concessions. 
  Under this, government posts would be given to "acceptable" 
members of the Khmer Rouge, provided the guerrillas open up 
their zones and merge their fighters with the national army. 
  Government officials said a major stumbling block was the 
Khmer Rouge's conditions for going along with the king's plan. 
  Chan Youran said the Khmer Rouge would comply with the 
king's 
proposal if the government agreed to what the guerrillas called 
their "minimum political platform." 
  A senior government official said this entailed scrapping 
the 
existing government and parliament and introducing a new power- 
sharing arrangement with the radicals. 
  That is considered quite out of the question by Phnom Penh, 
as it would mean the two-billion-dollar UN mission which laid 
the foundations for a democratically-elected government would 
have been in vain, he said. 
  "There is no way we can accept this," he declared. 
  Other government members accused the Khmer Rouge of 
deliberate obfuscation and suspected the guerrillas were only 
presenting a facade of interest in the peace talks in order to 
buy time. 
  "I don't believe there will be a positive result but let us 
wait and see what happens tomorrow," Yu Hokkri said. 
  Co-premier Hun Sen recently said that the only way the Khmer 
Rouge problem could be solved was through a combination of 
social development to improve the lives of the country's 
impoverished rural majority and also though military pressure.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 15 Jun (AKP) -- His Majesty King Norodom 
Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, on 12 June granted an interview to a 
BMD [Bulletin Mensuel de Documentation -- monthly bulletin of 
Sihanouk's secretariat] team in Beijing. Here is the entire 
interview. 
  BMD team: "Sir, your 11 June 1994 interview with Nate Thayer 
will please many compatriots and displease and offend other 
Cambodians, who dread your return to power. What will you do to 
reassure the honorable Cambodian personalities currently in 
power that it is not your intention to return to power? 
  Norodom Sihanouk: "I wish to reassure our current leaders in 
fact on my so-called "possible return to power." My age, 
health, and personal interest will not push me into [words 
indistinct] (?power) which brings me only deception, 
unpleasantness, extreme fatigue, and great dangers. I only 
answered a specific question from Nate Thayer who spoke to me 
about the case in which Cambodia (?and its) people were 
desperate and in mortal danger. In such a case, I was asked by 
Nate Thayer, would I let Cambodia and the Cambodian people die 
without trying to save them. To be frank, I answered no. I 
would prefer to die while trying to help save my fatherland and 
my people rather than to die on my hospital bed in Beijing. So, 
I gave Nate Thayer some details of my "political program" in 
case I was called upon by our current leaders (N.A. and the RGC) 
[National Assembly and the Royal Government of Cambodia] to 
ensure the rescue of Cambodia for one or two years. Well, "the 
Cambodian ship" will not sink anytime soon, despite serious 
damage. Therefore, we do not at all need a rescuer... [ellipsis 
as received] even one named Sihanouk. The only plan I have "in 
mind" seriously is not my return (not wished and not desirable) 
to power, but rather a new 35-mm film entitled "an apostle of 
non-violence" for which I will write the scenario and dialogues. 
This was inspired by the admirable action of Samdech Preah 
Khousananda and a venerable Khmer (?monk) killed by the Khmer 
Rouge during the third Thammyeatra [peace march by Buddhist 
monks]. So, I hope that our current leaders (whom I support and 
will always affectionately support) will not give too much 
importance to my so-called "plan" in case I was forced to 
"return to power." There is only one possibility in a thousand 
that such a case will present itself.

  [Text] KOMPAS discusses the failure of the textile trade 
talks between Indonesia and the United States in Bali last 
weekend. The earlier talks, held in Washington, also failed to 
reach an agreement. Therefore, it was the second time the talks 
were not successful. 
  The United States continues to reject Indonesia's request to 
increase the export quota of Indonesian textiles and textile 
products by 14 percent for certain textile categories. The 
United States is willing to increase the quota by 2 percent, and 
Indonesia cannot accept that. 
  As for the U.S. demand to have access to Indonesian markets 
for its commodity goods, a concrete agreement has not been 
reached yet. Against this background, KOMPAS urges the 
Indonesian Government to approach not only the USTR in 
Washington, but also the U.S. Senate, the State Department, the 
Agriculture Department, the U.S. Customs, and American business 
circles. As such, the success of the talks will be determined 
not only in formal negotiations but also through informal 
relations and personal approach. Such a personal approach is 
needed in future talks to produce results desired by Indonesia.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 14 (ANTARA) -- Minister of Mines and 
Energy I.B. Sujana said Monday that OPEC's strategy of 
maintaining static quota of 24.2 million barrels per day (BPD) 
is effective in keeping prices at the stable level. 
  The static quota has up to the second quarter of this year 
proved to be effective in stabilising prices, and therefore it 
is expected that the quota will be maintained until the end of 
this year, the minister said. 
  OPEC countries must also maintain their discipline, 
violating 
their respective quota, Sujana said when installing a number of 
senior officials at the state-owned Perum Gas Company. 
  In reply to a question in connection with the planned 
meeting 
of the price monitoring committee of OPEC's oil ministers in 
Vienna on June 15, the minister said that the decision by OPEC 
to maintain the production level is correct. 
  The OPEC oil ministers will discuss in the Vienna meeting 
the 
developments of oil prices, the minister said adding that the 
present quota was decided in March in anticipation of an 
increase in demand for oil supplies. 
  The prediction of increased demand was based on the recovery 
of economies of advanced countries after recession over the past 
few years. 
  Although the dry season has fallen in the countries of the 
Northern Hemisphere, the oil demand on the world market remains 
stable so that prices are improving. 
  According to the minister, the other factor which 
contributes 
to the improving price is the on-going repair of oil 
installations in the North Sea producer countries. 
  Supply of oil from the North Sea producing state was reduced 
temporarily as a result of the installation repair. 
  It seems that the non-OPEC producers have yet to increase 
their output from 4.5 million barrels per day to 5.3 million BPD. 
  Besides, the discipline of the OPEC members to abide by 
their 
respective production quota was able to prevent oil oversupply, 
he added. 
  The minister said that oil price at present is about 16 US 
dollars per barrel, higher than the price during the March-April 
period which stood at US$13 per barrel. 
  The price of Indonesian minas oil has since last month 
reached 15.9 dollars per barrel, he said. 
  He expressed the hope that the OPEC oil ministers will in 
the 
next meeting reach consensus that will continue to improve oil 
prices. 
  Minister Sujana said that the agenda of the meeting 
consisted 
of 15 items, including the succession of OPEC secretary general. 
  Current OPEC secretary general Subroto is to complete his 
tenure of office this month. 
  Sujana said that Subroto cannot be elected for the next 
period as he had occupied the post for two consecutive terms. 
  Venezuela's Oil Minister Dr. Parra and his Iranian 
counterpart Gholam Reza Aqazadeh are strong candidates for the 
secretary general post. 
  For Indonesia, the two candidates have similar commitment to 
OPEC, the minister said.

  [Text] DPR [House of Representatives] criticizes the 
government's decision to let foreign investors enter the local 
mass media business as it violates the existing press law (UU 
No. 21/1984), hampering national unity and the Pancasila state 
ideology. 
  The government issued the Regulation Number 20/1994 on 
Tuesday allowing foreign investors to have more than 50 percent 
shares in various businesses, including local mass media. On 
the other hand, foreign investors and executives are allowed to 
enter the local mass media. 
  Chairperson of the Commission I [in charge of foreign 
affairs, defense, security, and information] Aisyah Amini of the 
United Development Party (PPP) urged government to review its 
decision and reminded that mass media is still strategic in the 
national development. 
  She said that the foreign investment on mass media will 
hamper national unity and against the press law. National press 
in the developing countries has strategic role like informing 
public opinion and channelling people's aspiration. She 
suspected that foreign investors will not merely cope with 
commercial matters but also with political [ones], and this will 
influence the national ideology. "It ruins national press 
idealism," she added. 
  MP Zamhari of the Golkar [Functional Group] group said that 
government should reconsider the decision and reminded that this 
regulation is against the press law. He said that press law 
should not be "defeated" by such government's regulation and any 
policy must be based on constitutional ground. Any deviation 
from this should be handled in the frame of constitution, he 
said. 
  "Don't let ambition to attract foreign investment hamper our 
national unity," he stressed. 
  Any expansion of investment must not endanger our ideology, 
politics, and sociocultural systems, the MP added seriously. 
  Aminullah Ibrahim of the Armed Forces Group expressed his 
concern over the regulation. He said there is no reason to 
implement the policy and he reminded that foreign investments in 
mass media will surrender our sensitive communication and 
information system to the foreigners. "They can suppress us to 
accept their ideas, and this is dangerous," he said. 
  "Don't let foreign powers intervening our strategic 
sectors," 
Aminullah added. 
  MP Sabam Sirait of the Indonesian Democratic Party Group in 
the House told reporters here on Friday that government's 
decision is premature and it crushes Law Number 21/1984 on the 
national press. In the other word, Sabam added further, the 
Regulation Number 20/1994 is invalid.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Foreign-Owned Media in Indonesia] </F>
  [Text] Liberal-minded media proprietors and executives in 
this country had long yearned for a total free market-oriented 
media industry unbridled by any intervention in both editorial 
and management matters. Opposition to such a demand from 
concerned officials, leaders, and members of the media community 
itself had been equally strong. 
  Then, last week, three cabinet ministers (the information 
minister was not one of them) declared that the gate to foreign 
investment in the industry, which had been shut tight since the 
government banned Dutch and other foreign-owned press in the 
late fifties, was henceforth opened. As the announcement was 
like thunder under a sunny sky, heads shock in utter disbelief. 
  The decision was more than what the majority of domestic 
critics of the existing regulated media policy had bargained 
for. Under the new policy as outlined in Government Regulation 
No. 20/1994 dated May 19, foreign investors are freed from the 
previous minimum capital requirements and compulsory equity 
divestment for joint ventures and offered ownership in seaports, 
telecommunications, power, railways, civil aviation, nuclear 
power, and the mass media. 
  Without any scruple, the ministers laid open the reasons for 
the revolutionary reform in the government's foreign investment 
policy. The primary objectives, as they pointed out to newsmen, 
are to draw the mammoth sum of U.S. $305 billion in new 
investments during the current five-year plan and provide jobs 
for a sizeable share of the estimated new 2.5 million-strong 
labor force. 
  With the exception of the hitherto non-existent commercial 
nuclear power facility, the other industries are technically 
already in operation around the country, but some of them are 
handicapped by lack of funds and professional expertise to 
expand. Hence, the rapidly growing private sector involvement 
in what were once under full state monopoly. 
  But to those voicing their disappointment with the new 
policy, commercialism and professionalism are not the issue. The 
issue is whether their constitutional designation as protected 
fields should now be so radically compromised. 
  The decision to open up the mass media field to foreign 
investment is easily the most controversial and disturbing. How 
can the media industry be offered to foreign ownership in 
complete defiance of the principles envisaged in Law No. 21/1982 
[year as published] which compels the media to uphold the 
national philosophy, constitution, state policy, national 
journalistic canons, and Indonesian societal customs and norms, 
and for these reasons any involvement of foreign capital and 
personnel in the national media management and development is 
prohibited? 
  If in the unthinkable likelihood the three ministers were on 
the right road, we might then next expect the new policy to lead 
to a revision of the existing national law to suit the dictates 
of globalisation. If so, regulations regarding publishing 
permit, the constitutions and codes of ethics of the veletant 
[as published] professional organisations, and the provision 
giving journalists and media employees a 20-percent share of 
company stocks will also have to be revoked. 
  The new deregulation measures affecting the media contains 
an 
undeniably serious flaw harmful to the national interest. Its 
ominous defect, which could only be caused by unbelievably 
simple ignorance, presents the government with no alternative 
but to revert to a media policy consonant with Law No. 21 as 
demanded by both the publishers and journalists associations 
soon after the controversial government regulation was made 
public.

  [Text] Jakarta -- ETHNIC Chinese-owned business groups in 
Indonesia together with the country's security authorities, have 
launched a campaign to improve their image and their relations 
with the public, say executives of Chinese-owned companies. 
  The move follows outbreaks of rioting and public criticism 
in 
recent months over the gap between the rich and poor, and which 
culminated in rumours of violence two weeks ago. 
  Informal meetings have been held in several cities between 
military leaders and businessmen, focusing on observing the 
legal minimum wage and improving the treatment of employees. 
  Companies also agreed last week to take part in a community 
development programme. 
  Ethnic Chinese business leaders have welcomed the army's 
promise to protect them from any violence. 
  The companies have made commitments to pay the minimum wage, 
with many noting that when transport, food and medical payments 
are included, many workers receive more than the minimum. 
  In Surabaya, for instance, where minimum wages are 3,200 
rupiah a day, workers normally receive an additional 2,500 
rupiah in allowances plus annual bonuses. The companies say the 
government accepts that a minimum wage of 7,000 rupiah a day 
would not be economic. 
  Meetings have stressed the need for the ethnic Chinese-owned 
companies to pay salaries on time and to treat indigenous 
Indonesians with respect, in a polite and professional way. 
  Military and local government officials are also 
establishing 
a programme of social and community involvement under which 
companies are seen to be publicly supporting the community, 
especially its poorer members. 
  Projects will include supply of bathroom and toilet 
facilities in poor villages, building of kindergartens, and help 
with medical items such as spectacles for the poor. 
  Companies have been told that they must involve themselves 
in 
charitable and sponsorship activities so that they are not seen 
as only interested in making profits. 
  Company executives, who remain cautious about the 
possibility 
of outbreaks of violence, say that the measures are a positive 
way to reduce the perception of unfairness. 
  "The behaviour is the important thing," says one company 
chairman. "We are all Indonesians working together for our 
company and good work should be rewarded with good pay and 
professional treatment. " 
  Younger ethnic Chinese executives say they have integrated 
too deeply into Indonesian society to consider leaving, even if 
there is racial trouble. 
  "We have to be patient, and take a low-key approach," says 
one business leader when asked about allegations of arrogance by 
wealthy ethnic Chinese displaying their success with big houses 
and luxury cars.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I also have a 
statement in regard to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue. You 
will recall ladies and gentlemen that I made a statement on this 
just four days ago. But of course there are now new 
developments. 
  This is in regard to the still unconfirmed reports -- these 
are still unconfirmed -- that Pyongyang intends to withdraw from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. And if that step 
has not yet been officially taken by North Korea, we urge North 
Korea to remain in the IAEA so that an early and peaceful 
resolution through patient negotiation and creative diplomacy 
can be found to resolve this issue. 
  Our concern here stems from the possibility of nuclear 
proliferation because such proliferation is a destabilizing 
factor for global and regional security, and in turn will derail 
and disturb and possibly [word indistinct] normal economic 
growth and sustained development in our part of the world, if 
not in the entire globe itself. And as a developing country, 
certainly, we want to move our economic, social, and political 
development forward without disturbances of this nature. 
  I also have a statement in regard to the reported testing by 
China four days ago, or 10 June, where a nuclear test was 
reportedly undertaken at its testing site at Lop Nor. And as 
you all know, as a signatory of the United Nations treaty on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons the Philippines is strongly 
against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and this includes 
observance of a testing moratorium. So that in the end we hope 
that all of these tests will stop through a... or be made to 
cease through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent Manny Mogato] With Pyongyang ominously 
sounding the war drums and with Seoul (?gearing) to dance to the 
same music, in case of actual conflict between the two Koreas, 
the United States -- being committed to the defense of South 
Korea -- will certainly be drawn into the war. Mr. President, 
will the Philippines be also drawn into the same conflict by 
virtue of our mutual defense treaty with the United States? 
  [Ramos] No, that's very, very farfetched. You will recall 
that the Philippines joined in the so-called police action on 
the Korean peninsula -- which was occasioned by the invasion by 
North Korea of South Korea across the 38th parallel -- because 
of a UN Security Council resolution, not a defense treaty with 
any country. But before we could send our troops there, a law 
had to be passed, and this was Republic Act 573, the so-called 
Peptok Law passed by Congress in September 1950. So, it's not 
automatic that the Philippines rushes into the fray. After all, 
we are not the policeman of the world. But we have expressed 
our concern. 
  In my statement four days ago I cited five major reasons: 
  -- Because of our nonnuclear provisions in the 
Constitution, in the basic law; 
  -- Our membership in the IAEA board of governors, that is, 
Ambassador Rey Arcilla who is based in Austria; 
  -- Our proximity to the Korean peninsula. We are close 
enough, we are much closer than the United States; 
  -- The some 13 to... maybe more, thousand Filipinos in 
South Korea; and, 
  -- I mentioned it a while ago, the possible crippling and 
paralysis of economic activity in our part of the world. 
  In which, again, developing countries will become such 
a pity. The developed countries might benefit because of the 
war. What about us? Those are my concerns. 
  So, we have called for patient negotiation, consultation, 
and 
creative diplomacy so that perhaps we can find the acceptable 
solutions before sanctions are applied. 
  [Mogato] Follow-up, Mr. President. As member of the ASEAN, 
what do you think will be the role of the ASEAN in diffusing the 
threats of war in the Korean peninsula? 
  [Ramos] Well, certainly the ASEAN-member countries can take 
positions as we have done on a national basis. We are of course 
always in consultation within ASEAN with our sister countries. 
But as far as I know, ASEAN as a bloc has not yet come up with 
a position. Although in the recent senior officers meeting of 
the ASEAN Regional Forum which deals with security and defense 
matters, there was already at that level -- this is a lower 
level -- expressed the concerns of the ASEAN countries about the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. [sentence as heard] 
  Of course, I think you are aware of the initiatives of 
Russia 
to convoke an international conference that will involve now the 
principal negotiators with the two Koreas. I hope that 
something will come out of this because this is really in the 
realm of creative diplomacy and patient negotiation. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The International Monetary Fund has expressed 
concern over the rising inflation, which has averaged at near 
double-digit levels during the past three months. 
  "Inflation is not only their concern, it is also ours," said 
Finance Secretary Roberto F. De Ocampo. "But it is not the kind 
of concern that translates into panic." 
  Last month's inflation rate hit 10.1 percent while the March 
and April levels were at 9.7 and 9.8 percent, respectively. 
  A high inflation rate indicates rising cost of prices and a 
high level of liquidity in the system. 
  The economic program drafted by the government for IMF 
approval sets an inflation target for the year of only 8.5 
percent. 
  A team from the IMF is currently in Manila to get an update 
on the economic performance of the Philippines during the first 
quarter of the year. 
  "They are here to update their figures and make sure that it 
is in full consistency with what has been agreed upon," he said. 
  The team began discussions with the technical committee of 
the Philippines, which drafted the three-year economic program 
submitted last month. 
  "The review is in preparation for their orals when they 
defend the program in front of the (IMF) board," De Ocampo said. 
The IMF board is set to deliberate on the three-year economic 
program for the Philippines on 24 June. 
  "The IMF board is in the process of reviewing our request 
for 
an extended fund facility amounting to $650 million," according 
to De Ocampo. 
  "We are confident we will secure an IMF program, which will 
also enable us to proceed successfully with the much-awaited and 
long-delayed consultative group meeting for the Philippines on 
21 to 22 July in Paris as well as the fifth Paris Club 
rescheduling," he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Give Quiet Diplomacy A Chance in North Korea"] </F>
  [Text] Angry at the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) decision to suspend technical aid, North Korea announced 
on Monday that it was immediately withdrawing from the UN 
watchdog. 
  In a statement, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said the 
authorities would stop all IAEA inspections adding that any 
punitive measures taken would be regarded as declaration of war. 
  North Korea's defiant decision has caused worries in the 
region with some nations seeing the move as reinforcing the 
position of countries seeking sanctions at the UN Security 
Council. 
  The United States, Japan, and South Korea agree that the 
time 
has come to impose sanctions on North Korea because of its 
failure to allow international inspections of its nuclear 
programme. 
<H5>  Nuclear ambitions </H5>
  Yet few have asked what such sanctions would achieve, it 
being assumed that sooner or later North Korea would have to 
admit its nuclear ambitions. But if such a admission is not 
forthcoming and if neither Russia nor China cooperate fully with 
Washington, the US would have little real leverage, and North 
Korea would have succeeded in undermining the post-Cold War 
principle of the non- proliferation of nuclear arms. 
  As North Korea has rejected the final appeal to make 
available its nuclear records, the issue will be debated again 
by the United Nation Security Council. If a resolution is 
proposed to impose sanctions, what action will North Korea take? 
  Assuming that UN Security Council sanctions are imposed, 
there is a strong possibility Pyongyang will decide to leave the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  Ironically, North Korea's accession to the NPT in 1985 has 
been attributed to Soviet pressure. In 1992, Boris Yeltsin 
declared that Russia would not help North Korea in the event of 
a war despite having an assistance pact which Moscow signed with 
Pyongyang in 1961. 
  Withdrawing from the NPT is the right of all signatories to 
the treaty though withdrawal must follow a set procedure which 
includes a three month notice. 
  Once outside the NPT, North Korea would undoubtedly suffer 
from further recriminations and isolation. But UN action to 
impose sanctions or take other measures would be legitimized 
only if the country could be declared a common security danger 
to the general peace and safety of the world. 
  Is it credible to regard North Korea as such? 
  The claim that it is a general threat because of its 
development of nuclear weapons is a weak one. There are several 
states outside the NPT, including Pakistan, India and Israel 
that have nuclear arms programmes more sophisticated than North 
Korea's. 
  Also, North Korea has not been engaged in a war since 1953, 
and although Kim Il-song's international behaviour is something 
like that of a mad man, Pyongyang's recent record is no worse 
than say Syria, which is presently being courted by Washington 
as an associate in the Middle East peace process. 
  With these considerations in mind, it is unlikely that China 
would cooperate in imposing sanctions on North Korea and would 
veto any Security Council resolution. More than half of 
Pyongyang's external trade is with Beijing and China still 
provides credit to North Korea. 
<H5>  World of the sane </H5>
  Meanwhile, the Russian proposal to convene an international 
conference on the issue seems to complicate matters. Ever since 
Yeltsin's visit to South Korea in 1992, Russian influence in 
North Korea has been considerably reduced. This in turn has 
caused Yeltsin to come under severe criticism back home, with 
his detractors saying that Russia's foreign policy is being 
tailor-made to suit Washington. 
  This leaves the United States in a very awkward position. 
Though South Korea and Japan have agreed with Washington to 
impose sanctions against North Korea, it is doubtful whether 
they would be effective without the support of China and Russia. 
  We do agree that the Kim Il-song regime in Pyongyang must be 
helped into the world of the sane. However, imposing 
US-proposed sanctions would only prove to be a big farce. North 
Korea must not be provoked further because the threat of war on 
the peninsula is real. Quiet diplomacy must be given a chance 
and under such circumstances the display of machismo by the 
United States is just as dangerous as a cornered and embattled 
North Korea.

  [Text] The Khmer Rouge in Zone 505 clearly prosper from the 
timber trade with Thailand. They live in solid wooden houses, 
have electricity, watch television, and some of their children 
play with hand-held electronic games. 
  "The Khmers here are somewhat better off than elsewhere," 
said a Thai timber trader. "Safety is 100 pre cent secure" in 
terms of traveling and communications. 
  A week ago, it took three hours from Bo Rai district in the 
southeastern Thai province of Trat to reach this timber-rich 
community in Samlaut. The best route there is maintained by the 
Khmer Rouge throughout the year because it is the only one that 
is usable during the wet season. 
  A four-wheel-drive truck is the only vehicle that can make 
the journey. Thai timber traders stocked up with rice, dried 
and fresh food. Most of it was for improving relations with 
guards along the way and ranking Khmers important to the smooth 
operation of their business. 
  Three Thai military checkpoints were passed before Khmer 
Rouge outposts were reached. These border guards seemed to 
appreciate salted mackerel in particular. War veterans, they 
had been taken off the battlefield and posted to these 
checkpoints to deal with Thai traders because they had been 
maimed by landmines. 
  Zone 505 is in rich, variegated forest. Several Thai traders 
said they were more confident doing business with the Khmer 
Rouge than with people they refer to as Khmer Khao (White 
Khmers), meaning those loyal to the government in Phnom Penh. 
  "They [the Khmer Rouge] do not collect fees along the way 
like the Khmer Khao," one trader pointed out. "Safety in terms 
of logging and access to sites is more or less reliable 
  "If anything, it is fellow Thais who cause problems. The 
Khmer Rouge officials keep to their word." 
  Zone 505 is home to 20,000 people, the majority of them 
women 
and children, many very young - the result of a Khmer Rouge 
population drive that has seen girls from age of 18 married off 
and encouraged to produce, residents said. 
  But the leadership remains stringent about family life, no 
adultery or polygamy is allowed. 
  According to Lok Nong, who is on the central committee of 
Zone 505, with special duties to co-ordinate with Thais and look 
after the timber trade, Khmer Rouge administration allows for 
some autonomy. 
  If the zone's forces seize any territory belonging to 
government they are entitled to take charge and administer the 
benefits of that territory. 
  "Zone 505 is reputed to be very experienced in fighting," he 
said. 
  The Khmer Rouge retake of Pailin, located north of here, 
last 
month was largely the work of soldiers from Zone 505. 
  Khmer Rouge units were closing in on Battambang and would 
eventually take the country's second largest provincial capital 
if the government obtained no foreign support, he claimed. 
  "Thailand does not send arms to Democratic Kampuchea. We 
have to be self-sufficient in every respect now," Lok said. 
  At community level, Khmer Rouge self-sufficiency is ensured 
by the central committee through a cooperative system. The 
committee administers the use of a central pool of tractors, 
rollers and other farming equipment, and the distribution of 
seeds to each household. 
  "Democratic Kampuchea's main sources of income are timber 
and 
gems," Lok said. "The income is used to improve the welfare of 
each zone. We do not let any one individual or even the top 
administrator enrich himself alone." 
  Logging is carried out through cooperatives composed of no 
less than 10 parties. The main rule is to fell trees that are 
sufficiently large. 
  While Zone 505's main income is timber, zone 405 located 
further north is engaged in gems. The men of this even more 
comfortable Khmer Rouge community are said to be reluctant to go 
to the battlefield. 
  The destination of Thai timber traders is a medium-size saw 
mill in the middle of a forest in Samlaut. Khmer Rouge soldiers 
off duty from the frontlines guard the stacks of sawn timber on 
site. 
  Some 50 kilometers beyond, in a mountainous and forested 
area, a large pile of felled logs -- as many as 10,000 according 
to Khmer Rouge reckoning -- is waiting to be hauled across the 
border into Thailand. 
  "Democratic Kampuchea will look after the timber until 
Thailand permits this," said a Khmer Rouge soldier. 
  Zone 505 enjoys relative peace and fairly good means of 
communication with surrounding areas. But the area is heavily 
mined. 
  "We lean on Thais when we are in trouble," Lok said. 
  "Now we are at peace, we want to encourage Thais to come and 
do business with us more than other nationals, who want only to 
drain us of our natural resources," he said.

  [Text] ASEAN has agreed on group cooperation in the areas 
of telecommunications and transportation. An agreement was 
reached at the meeting of ASEAN senior economic officials in 
Indonesia on the setting up by ASEAN of a department to study 
group cooperation in telecommunications and transportation; a 
proposal on this is to be forwarded to the ministerial meeting 
in Thailand around September. The project will be treated as 
urgent. The meeting also agreed to have the Philippines study 
the framework of ASEAN cooperation in the service sector. 
  Karun Kittisathaphon, deputy permanent secretary of the 
Commerce Ministry, reported that the senior officials' meeting 
in Indonesia on 6-8 June studied Thailand's proposal for group 
cooperation in service trading. Although this does not mean 
there is a need to open up markets for the service trade, the 
cooperation will support and stimulate the implementation of the 
ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA. Thailand's proposal was 
accepted at the meeting, which assigned the Philippines to take 
the lead in studying the framework of cooperation. 
  The meeting also agreed to conduct a survey on tariffs on 
service goods in telecommunications and transportation in order 
to contribute to the AFTA plan. Each country will appoint a 
delegation to attend a meeting on this subject. A proposal will 
be made to the ASEAN ministers' meeting for study after which it 
will be forwarded to the ASEAN summit, which is scheduled to be 
held in Bangkok early next year. 
  The deputy permanent secretary for commerce added that the 
meeting of the senior officials in Indonesia reviewed the 
implementation of the AFTA plan and proposed that efforts be 
made to shorten the span of tariff reduction from 8 to 5 years 
and also to include unprocessed farm products in the AFTA plan.

  [Text] Vietnam is emerging as a potential competitor to 
Thailand in attracting investment in production facilities by 
auto manufacturers looking for countries to relocate to, an 
analyst said. 
  Thailand may lose its competitive edge to Vietnam due to the 
latter country's low property and labour costs, and the abundant 
natural resources there. 
  The analyst suggested that Thailand will have to develop its 
auto industry in order to maintain its competitiveness. 
  "The development of manpower technology and marketing, for 
continuous growth in this industry, needs to be taken seriously 
if Thailand is to remain the largest auto production base in 
Asean," the analyst said. 
  Vietnam has the potential of be coming a very large market 
as 
the country has a population of 70 million people but only 
200,000 cars. The increasing buying power of the Vietnamese will 
present a great marketing opportunity for Thailand, he continued. 
  At present, Thailand's auto industry is more competitive 
than 
ever after the lifting of the high tariff on imported cars by 
the government in 1992. The lowering of the tariffs awakened 
local producers after 30 years of protection to the fact that 
they have to fight to keep their market, which in turn has led 
to healthy competition. 
  The liberalization the country's auto industry has 
benefitted 
Thai consumers, as they now have a larger selection of cars to 
choose from at more competitive prices. 
  When the tariffs first came down domestic auto makers seemed 
uneasy with the government's measures, but they've managed to 
adjust themselves to the changing environment. 
  In the past few years, we've also seen changes in the 
automobile industry as a whole. Giant auto makers such as 
General Motors, are planing to invest in production plant here 
again; General Motors left Thailand in 1978. 
  The American auto maker, in a joint-venture, is planning to 
build the largest auto plant in Asia, reflecting the market 
potential of Thailand. 
  The Japanese auto makers, not to be outdone, are also 
planning to invest in assembly plants here with a combined 
production capacity of up to 600,000 cars a year by 1996, which 
is considerably higher than the current 460,000 cars per year. 
  Toyota is also planning to turn out 200,000 cars per year by 
1996 with a new plant located at the Gateway Industrial estate. 
The plant will be the company's largest one outside Japan and 
will require an investment of Bt [baht] 1 billion. 
  These manufacturers recognise the potential growth in the 
country's automobile industry, but for Japan the relocation is 
partly due to the strength of the yen against other currencies. 
  The growth of the domestic auto market stemmed from the rise 
of the middle-classes and the lack of a mass transit system in 
Bangkok. 
  Auto sales in 1992 totalled 456,000, a jump of 26 per cent 
from the previous year. Experts say sales growth targets are 
expected to decrease but the sale of 500,000 cars is not an 
unattainable goal, even though interest rates and gasoline 
prices are on the rise. 
  Auto makers are planning to make Thailand an export base, 
but 
exporting won't be easy since they will have to produce at least 
one million cars per year in order to achieve sufficient 
economies of scale to reduce production costs. Korea had 
developed the capacity to produce two million cars when it first 
began to export. 
  In order for Thailand to become an export base, the industry 
needs to develop its manpower, technology and supporting 
industries, such as electronic parts production and plastic and 
aluminum production, as these are all needed by the automobile 
industry.

  [Text] Although Thailand has succeeded in cutting opium 
production by 99 per cent in three decades, the high output of 
2,000 tons from its neighbours still makes the Golden Triangle 
the world's largest narcotics producing region. 
  The increase in opium production in the region over the past 
20 years is due to rising demand in consumer countries in 
Europe, North America and in Australia, according to Pol Gen 
Chawalit Yotmani, secretary general of the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board (ONCB). 
  He said Thailand's success in reducing opium output to about 
20 tons per year was the result of the introduction of royal 
projects on cash crop substitution and rural development. 
  Chawalit was one of five guests invited to appear on Kho 
Khit 
Duai Khon (Sharing Views) chaired by Dr Choemsak Pinthong, 
associate professor of Thammasat University's Economics Faculty. 
The recorded programme will be telecast next month. 
  The crop substitution programmes have been recognized by UN 
drug agencies which are pushing for a regional effort to combat 
illicit drugs. Thailand, he said, has already signed an 
agreement with Burma and Laos to assist them in crop 
substitution programmes. 
  Chawalit said regional cooperation is also needed in 
suppressing drug trafficking. Traffickers have recently opened 
up new routes through China, but Thailand's good transport 
infrastructure still contributes to the majority of the area's 
heroin production moving through it onto the world market, he 
added. 
  He said the United States had already recognized the need to 
apply a multi-level anti-narcotics strategy including the 
reduction of local demand in its combat against drugs. The 
United States, he said, will concentrate in the next four to 
five years on the suppression of local demand and the 
rehabilitation of drug addicts. 
  Chawalit's views were shared by another panelist, Gary 
Suwannarat, a senior adviser of the UNDCP Projects Coordination 
Office, who said the US narcotics policy was partly wrong in 
concentrating mainly on suppressing the supply side while 
overlooking the reduction of local demand. 
  She said a multi-pronged antidrugs approach which addresses 
all aspects of narcotics activities is needed to successfully 
wipe out the drugs. Washington has said that 60 per cent of the 
heroin in the United States originated in Southeast Asia. 
  Suwannarat, Chawalit and other guest speakers, however, 
cautioned that while heroin might be reduced eventually, other 
new addictive chemicals could spring up to fill the market. 
  According to Dr Annop Wisuthimak, director of a 
rehabilitation unit for drug addicts, alcohol is the worst and 
most devastating substance of abuse as it contributes to 
accidents and violent acts such as brawls and physical 
harassment. 
  One person is killed and three people are admitted to 
hospital every hour in Thailand as a result of alcohol-related 
incidents, said Annop, who cited survey studies to support his 
statements. 
  Other substances, such as inhaled solvents and amphetamines 
are more dangerous than heroin as they are relatively cheap and 
widely available in the market, according to Annop. But he said 
alcohol causes the largest economic loss to the country, about 
Bt80 billion per year. 
  Chawalit and Annop agreed that amphetamines will pose the 
greatest danger in Thailand in the future as the production 
process is much easier than that of heroin and can even be done 
in vehicles. 
  The ONCB secretary-general said there is a need to control 
the import of chemicals used to produce amphetamines and to 
suppress their illegal smuggling especially by fishing vessels. 
  Two years after Parliament passed new anti-narcotics laws 
which included the forfeiture of drug traffickers' assets, the 
courts have already tried and sentenced 11 narcotics cases and 
the police have subsequently seized the assets and properties of 
60 persons involved, according to Chawalit.

<F P=106> [Dialogue between station reporters Chong Song-kan and Yi </F>
In- chun: "Self-Defense Measure Reflecting Our People's Firm 
Will"] 
  [Text] [Chong Song-kan] Hello. 
  [Yi In-chun] Hello. 
  [Chong] On 13 June, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign 
Ministry issued a statement on the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] Secretariat's creation of a grave situation 
[omjunghan sataerul chosongsikin kotkwa kwallyonhaeso] that 
poses great threats to our people's dignity and our country's 
safety by following the U.S. policy of crushing Korea. We are 
going to discuss this matter in today's program. 
  [Yi] Yes, let us do so. As has been reported in the 
statement, our country's Foreign Ministry spokesman sternly 
denounced [chunyorhi kyutan] the United States, which is opposed 
to our people, and the IAEA Board of Governors, which follows 
the United States, for adopting an unreasonable resolution 
[chonman pudanghan kyorui] against us, and strictly declared 
that we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA to defend the 
nation's dignity and sovereignty. 
  The spokesman also declared that we can no longer allow the 
inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which 
we have accepted in our special capacity, and strongly 
reaffirmed our position that UN sanctions will be regarded 
immediately as a declaration of war. 
  This is our due self-defense measure [ungdanghan chawijok 
chochi] that was inevitably taken because our peaceful nuclear 
activities hit a bigger snag [uriui pyonghwajok haekhwaltongi 
kumankum changaeman patke toegi ttaemune] due to the abnormal 
situation [pijongsangjogin satae] created by anti-Republic 
maneuvers of the United States and some officials [kyechung] of 
the IAEA that follows the United States. It is also our 
Republic's revolutionary response to the wrong acts [kuruttoen 
chosa] of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and some officials of 
the IAEA Secretariat. 
  [Chong] Yes, it is. 
  [Yi] Our people are now actively supporting the decision of 
the Republic's government to withdraw from the IAEA, regarding 
it as a just measure to defend the nation's dignity and the 
country's sovereignty. 
  [Chong] Yes, they are. Our Republic's declaration to 
withdraw from the IAEA is a just measure to cope with the 
insidious maneuvers [pulsunhan chaektonge chudongjoguro 
taechohagiwihan chongdanghan chochi] by the U.S. imperialists 
and some officials of the agency's Secretariat to crush [apsal] 
our socialist system. 
  [Yi] Surely it is. 
  [Chong] As everyone knows, the world recognizes that even in 
our special status, we have made all possible, well-intended, 
efforts to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities. 
However, the more we accepted inspections by the agency, the 
more the pressure on us has increased and the more things have 
become complicated, so that the security and sovereignty of our 
Republic are being threatened at every moment. This is an 
intolerable, serious matter. 
  [Yi] Yes, it really is. 
  [Chong] Frankly speaking, human patience has its limits, 
doesn't it? 
  [Yi] Yes, it does. Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat 
have escalated the anti-Republic crushing maneuver 
[pangonghwaguk apsal chaektongul kyedansiguro hwaktaehae watko], 
ignoring all our good intentions and tolerance [sonuiwa aryang]. 
On 10 June, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an unreasonable 
resolution on suspension of the agency's assistance for our 
country while demanding the opening of our military sites [kunsa 
taesangdul] over the nuclear issue. This is the agency's 
sanction against us and, in essence, a prelude to UN sanctions. 
In this, the United States and the agency's Secretariat openly 
revealed their attempt to infringe upon our sovereignty and 
crush us by using the inspection lever [sachal konggan]. 
  [Chong] You are right. The IAEA Secretariat's forcible 
demand that we allow overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] by the 
agency and its threat to impose so-called sanctions on us are an 
intolerable insult to our people who regard independence as 
their lives. 
  [Yi] I agree. 
  [Chong] Our people are not the sort of people who take 
insults to their national sovereignty and dignity. The more 
pressure and sanctions are imposed on us, the stronger our will 
will grow and the more free our peaceful nuclear activities will 
become. 
  As we declared on many occasions, any brigandish logic or 
strong-armed action can never work with us. If hostile forces 
[choktae seryoktul] impose new sanctions on us despite our 
repeated warnings, we will take stern self-defensive measures 
commensurate with it. 
  [Yi] I believe so. With our country's Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's 13 June statement that plainly reflects our people's 
firm will, we will consider all unreasonable resolutions adopted 
by the IAEA with regard to our issue up to the present as 
invalid and will not be bound to any rule or decision of the 
agency hereafter. Without the agency, we can develop our 
independent nuclear power industry and expand international 
cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities [haekhwaltong 
punya]. 
  Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed until we 
decide whether to return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
or to completely withdraw from it. Hence, there is nothing for 
the agency's inspectors to do any further in our country. 
  As sanctions cannot coexist with dialogue, it is our 
inevitable choice to respond to further sanctions by the United 
States, some officials of the IAEA, and the hostile forces with 
further self-defensive measures. Our steadfast position will 
never change until the nuclear issue is fairly resolved through 
dialogue and negotiations. 
  [Chong] You are right. Our people value the national 
dignity and sovereignty as their lives. Our people will never 
allow any act by the U.S. imperialists and some officials of the 
IAEA Secretariat to infringe upon our sovereignty and to crush 
us. 
  [Yi] Absolutely not. 
  [Chong] The United States, some officials of the IAEA 
Secretariat, and hostile forces had better discreetly act while 
facing reality in the face. 
  [Yi] Right. 
  [Chong] We must now conclude our dialogue. 
  [Yi] All right.

<F P=106> ["Despicable Political Tool of Specified Forces" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
says the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must no more 
be a despicable political tool of specified forces. 
  The paper notes: 
  The IAEA decided not to call in question Japan's concealment 
of plutonium. This is an unjustifiable act to evade its 
responsibility for having failed to properly discharge its 
mission. 
  It is maximizing the DPRK's "nuclear issue" with a 
groundless 
"suspicion", while leaving alone the criminal caught red-handed 
who intentionally and wantonly violated the nuclear 
non-proliferation system. This is the height of partiality and 
the double standard. 
  The partiality of the IAEA is found, above all, in its 
notion 
of the nuclear danger. 
  Japan's concealment of a large amount of plutonium is 
directly linked with its nuclear armament. Japan hopes to 
become a nuclear power with thousands of, tens of thousands of 
nuclear weapons. For the IAEA not to call in question the 
concealment of plutonium is to connive at and foster Japan's 
wild ambition to become a nuclear power. 
  Japan's nuclear armament is a new big threat to peace in 
Asia 
and the rest of the world. Compared with it, the fledgling 
peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK which extracts a tiny 
amount of plutonium for an experimental purpose do not pose a 
threat to anyone. It is unreasonable for the agency to maximize 
the matter of the minimum of amount of reported plutonium of the 
DPRK. 
  The prejudice and partiality of the agency only impair its 
authority and dignity. 
  The partiality of the IAEA is manifested also in judging the 
possibility of divergence of nuclear material. The 70 kg of 
plutonium of the Tokaimura nuclear fuel-making plant of Japan 
was reportedly discovered at three of the 17 glove boxes of the 
plant. 
  The world considers that the amount of plutonium exposed in 
Japan this time where many nuclear facilities have been in 
operation for scores of years is a very small part of the total 
amount concealed all over Japan. 
  The IAEA which should solve Japan's diversion of plutonium 
which stands out with great urgency in actuality is bringing 
forward the non-existent diversion of nuclear material by the 
DPRK, making the situation complicated, while covering up the 
immediate question. 
  The effectiveness of the DPRK-proposed method of preserving 
the technical possibility for the later measurement of fuel rods 
has been proved theoretically and experimentally and recognized 
by world's experts. Nevertheless, the IAEA is deliberately 
distorting the stark objective reality and blocking a smooth 
solution of the DPRK's "nuclear issue" under an unjustifiable 
pretext. This is a very irresponsible act. 
  Facts show that the IAEA Secretariat does not seek 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons but has pursued the 
sinister political aim of stifling the DPRK from the beginning 
according to a prearranged scenario under the manipulation of 
specified forces. 
  If the agency continues to pursue a vicious political aim, 
expanding partiality, the non-nuclear states, the third world 
countries, will no more trust it.

<F P=106> ["The United States Does Not Know How Bold and Decisive </F>
Supreme Commander Kim Chong-il Is; Radio Voice of America" -- 
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Radio Voice of America 
said on June 5 that there is a heated discussion on what phase 
would be created by "sanctions" against North Korea in the U.S. 
Congress, academic and public circles and even in the U.S. 
military. 
  The radio said that the dove camp, especially former U.S. 
high-ranking officials and former U.S. generals who were 
involved in the policy toward North Korea for a rather long 
period and who, staying in South Korea, frequently contacted 
North Korea repeatedly advised Washington to ponder over the 
matter, saying it is a mistake if it thought "sanctions" or 
"military response" against North Korea would be effective. 
  The radio quoted them as saying the United States does not 
know North Korea yet and, particularly, how bold and decisive 
supreme commander Kim Chong-il is. Suffice it to recall the 
situation on the Korean peninsula which abruptly took a critical 
turn in March last year, they said. 
  The radio quoted them as stressing that the U.S. must know 
well the preparedness of the North Korean Army equipped with 
modern weapons and well trained for action. 
  Not a few figures in the United States hold that, no matter 
how important the "nuclear issue" may be, the United States must 
open the door for dialogue to North Korea once again before 
taking "sanctions" and "military countermeasure", the radio said.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev on June 10 in a 
joint press conference concerning the talks in Turkzy made 
public that the United States and Russia agreed on submitting to 
the UN Security Council a joint resolution envisaging a 
convocation of an international meeting on the security and 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while applying 
"sanctions" to the DPRK, according to a report. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that the moves to 
isolate 
and stifle the DPRK are expanding, assuming a new aspect in the 
international arena. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  It is not to be thought of to convene an international 
meeting while applying "sanctions" to us. "Sanctions" and 
dialogue are incompatible. 
  We expressed some concern over the Russia-proposed 
international meeting, proceeding from the hope that it may 
make an affirmative contribution to a fair solution of the 
nuclear issue and other matters on the Korean peninsula through 
negotiations after the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks. But we 
will never allow any attempt to make the international meeting a 
lever of pressure on us. 
  We have made it clear that in case any "sanction" is applied 
to us, the parties joining it whether it is at their own will 
or against their will, and the parties backing it, would take 
the responsibility for this. This is not an empty talk. 
  We are ready to solve the matter through dialogue and 
negotiations but we will strongly counter pressure and 
"sanctions" against us.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Hostile Policy Toward Korea Will Fail" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- World public bitterly 
condemned the anti-DPRK nuclear racket of the United States and 
its followers. 
  The Malian paper AURORE May 19 said that since the DPRK-U.S. 
talks for a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula broke up, the situation in the peninsula has become 
extremely acute. It charged that Washington and Seoul were 
stepping up nuclear war preparations, crying for "sanctions" 
against North Korea. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it noted, can be 
resolved only through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. 
  A radio of Iran May 31 said the United States is claiming 
pressure and "sanctions" against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea only, while failing to throw into question 
Israel that has many nuclear weapons. 
  The U.S. hostile policy vis-a-vis Korea will fail in face of 
the resistance from the world people, it said. 
  The May issue of the Dutch magazine INTERNATIONAL LIBERATION 
said the question of guaranteeing peace on the Korean peninsula 
in the future depends on the U.S. attitude. 
  Noting that the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are 
equipped with nuclear weapons and extensively staging war 
exercises against the DPRK, the magazine said the DPRK has its 
independent right to protect itself from a U.S. nuclear attack.

Christian Churches of South Korea in a policy discussion of the 
reunification committee June 10 said that the U.S.-led move of 
"sanctions" against the North might get on its nerve and 
demanded that "the United States stop utterances and acts 
creating tensions on the Korean peninsula," a Seoul-based radio 
said. 
  Noting that the authorities' inconsistent "policy" towards 
the North increases the confusion and uneasiness of the people, 
the organisation decided to strongly urge the puppet authorities 
to "shape and promote a reunification policy giving top priority 
to the existence and peace of the nation." 
  The Federation of Christian Social Movement in a recent 
statement clarified its stand opposed to "`sanctions' against 
the North," that heightens the war crisis.

  [Text] In an interview with NHK today, Yi To-sop, North 
Korean ambassador to Thailand, said a visit by former President 
Carter to North Korea would provide a good opportunity for North 
Korea to manifest its enthusiasm for a settlement of the nuclear 
issue. 
  [Begin Yi recording in English] I think that his visit will 
provide a good opportunity to manifest our willingness to solve 
this nuclear issue or break the nuclear impasse with the United 
States through dialogue, peacefully. [end recording] 
  During the interview, the North Korean ambassador stated 
whether North Korea will withdraw from the NPT, the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, or not hinges on how the United States 
will deal with the nuclear issue and stressed anew that only 
dialogue between North Korea and the United States could lead to 
a settlement of the nuclear issue. 
  Commenting on IAEA inspectors who are still staying in North 
Korea after North Korea announced its withdrawal from the IAEA, 
the North Korean ambassador said North Korea would not forcibly 
expel them.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter and his entourage arrived here today. 
  Kim Yong-nam, vice-premier and minister of foreign affairs, 
met them. 
  They were met by Song Ho-kyong, vice-minister of foreign 
affairs, at Panmunjom. 
  At Panmunjom Carter said that he had longed for visiting 
Korea to meet its leaders from long ago and he was very glad to 
be invited. 
  He said he hopes to meet President Kim Il-song. 
  He expressed the conviction that Korea's reunification would 
be realized without fail.

<F P=106> ["Ugly Outpourings of Traitor" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sam the 
traitor, when he met ex-President of the U.S. Jimmy Carter 
visiting South Korea Tuesday, again let out a string of rubbish 
about the "inevitability of UN sanctions against the North," 
driveling that the withdrawal of the North from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is "something 
abnormal" and "a downright challenge to the demand of the 
international community," according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  At a press conference after meeting Carter that day, the 
puppet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu cried that "the UN Security 
Council will take a determined measure, should the North fail to 
change its attitude." 
  The puppets used a profusion of ugly words to bring their 
sinister intention against the North home to Carter on the eve 
of his visit to the North. 
  Kim Yong-sam the traitor even asked Carter to "particularly 
guard against the smiling strategy of the North" while visiting 
it, unable to conceal his extreme uneasiness and irritation. 
  This made it plain that the traitor was secretly vexed by 
Carter's visit to Pyongyang. 
  Kim Yong-sam's hysteric outcry that the North's withdrawal 
from the IAEA is "something abnormal" was a ridiculous jargon. 
His hue and cry was, in the final analysis, a mean trash for 
evading responsibility for the criminal act in having driven the 
situation to a catastrophic phase by joining hands with the 
United States and some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat in the 
adoption of a "resolution" to stifle the DPRK. By insisting on 
the "inevitability of UN sanctions" the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
fully revealed the real intention of the South Korean puppet 
clique to isolate and stifle the North at any cost by laying 
obstacles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks all along.

  [Text] According to a broadcast report from Seoul on 13 
June, the U.S. imperialist Armed Forces of aggression in South 
Korea staged a farce by making a show of Apache assault 
helicopters. The U.S. imperialist war mongers were bent on 
inciting a war fever by babbling that the assault helicopters, 
which they brought in last March as part of their maneuverings 
to reinforce the Armed Forces aimed at a northward invasion, are 
high performance helicopters. The U.S. imperialist war mongers 
also made a show of Patriot missiles not long ago and staged a 
farce of demonstrating how to operate those missiles.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
deployed on Thursday formations of Pacific-based pursuit-assault 
planes and VTOL [vertical take-off and landing] assault planes 
at the U.S. Air Force bases in South Korea, according to 
military sources. 
  The warplanes were flown in an air war exercise with the 
skies above Yongwol, Chunchon and Asan Bay as its operational 
theatre. In coordination with more than 100 fighter-bombers, 
assault planes, observation planes and reconnaissance planes of 
the U.S. Seventh Air Force stationed in South Korea, they staged 
an exercise of striking targets and supporting ground attack. 
  The drill was a wildcat war gamble designed to increase the 
capability of quick flight of the fighter planes of the U.S. 
Marines to the Korean peninsula and their capacity of surprise 
strikes at the North in coordination with the U.S. Air Force 
flying corps present in South Korea. 
  The frantic war exercises against the northern half of Korea 
clearly reveal the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S. 
imperialists.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Koreans' organisations 
and Koreans in Americas and Europe are briskly conducting 
activities to make this year a year of the great unity of the 
nation. 
  The American Committee on the Korean Question repeatedly 
published informations supporting the 10-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation in December last year and early 
this year. 
  The informations said the 10-point programme is the most 
fair 
and aboveboard proposal of reunification acceptable to anyone 
irrespective of differences in ideology and idea, party 
affiliation and religious belief. 
  The One Korea Movement in a statement said the 10-point 
programme indicates the way of ending the national division, 
promoting the national interests and achieving security and 
prosperity of the Korean nation. 
  Son Hak-won, chairman of the Society for the Study of the 
Chuche Idea of Koreans in the United States, in his address to a 
meeting held in Los Angeles in April to celebrate the birthday 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song, called on overseas 
compatriots to build an independent, democratic, neutral and 
denuclearized country by following the spirit of the great 
national unity of President Kim Il-song. 
  A meeting for achieving Korea's reunification under the 
banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation also was held in Washington in April, and the 3rd meeting 
of the Society for Peaceful Reunification of Korea took place in 
Berkeley, the United States. 
  Organisations of Koreans overseas are briskly conducting 
activities to explain and disseminate the 10-point programme of 
the great unity of the whole nation. 
  Organizations of Koreans in Germany published and 
distributed 
to compatriots the "10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the 
Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country" and books 
explaining the programme, including "Great Charter of National 
Unity" and "New Evolution of Principles of National 
Reunification."

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets, at around 09:15 Tuesday, brought 90-mm recoilless guns 
into the demilitarized zone [DMZ] near Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, 
South Korean Kangwon Province, and installed them at their 
position and took a firing posture at the North side, seriously 
threatening the safety of soldiers of the Korean People's Army 
who were on their routine duty at the post, according to 
military sources. 
  On the same day, a crowd of puppet Army bandits armed with 
automatic weapons, crawled into the demilitarized zone in front 
of Mt. Taedok in Changpung County on the western sector of the 
front and whipped up war hysterics, running about the area. 
  These were deliberate and premeditated acts of the South 
Korean puppets to render the situation of the DMZ strained and 
incite North-South confrontation. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop acting rashly, pondering 
over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless 
military provocations.

<F P=106> ["National Conference Must Be Convened" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The present situation 
makes it incumbent upon our compatriots to come out without 
hesitation to the plaza of the national conference which will 
open a new chapter of national reconciliation and unity, 
irrespective of residence and job, if they to not want to fall a 
victim to big powers but really want the peace and peaceful 
reunification of the country, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed 
article today. 
  The great unity of the nation is the best way out for all 
the fellow countrymen to remove the danger of a nuclear war 
facing the nation, defend the peace of the country and open a 
phase of turnround for its independent and peaceful 
reunification, the paper notes, and goes on: 
  All the fellow countrymen in the North and the South and 
overseas fully support the convocation of a national conference 
which will seek a short cut to reunification in the 90s by 
promoting the great unity of the nation and pooling the will and 
wisdom of the nation, surpassing differences in ideology, idea 
and political view. 
  But the Kim Yong-sam group, which dislikes the peace and 
peaceful reunification of the country, is desperately opposing 
our proposal for the convocation of a national conference 
unreasonably branding it as "united front tactics" and is 
cracking down with the bayonet upon the South Korean students, 
political parties and organisations and individual figures 
aspiring after the opening of the national conference. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group answered our proposal with its role 
of 
the shockbrigade in the "nuclear" row of the outside forces 
against the northern half of Korea, clamouring for "a tough 
response," "an international cooperation system" and "sanctions 
against the North." 
  This reveals the vicious plot to block the great unity of 
the 
nation by frustrating the convocation of the national conference 
at any cost and ignite a nuclear war against the North together 
with outside forces. This is an unpardonable criminal act which 
can be done only by such rare traitors and warmaniacs as the Kim 
Yong-sam group which takes no notice of the country and the 
nation, peace and peaceful reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to block the convocation 
of 
the national conference for national reconciliation and unity 
with sword-brandishing and war moves, but in vain. 
  Unshakable is the will of the 70 million fellow countrymen 
to 
convene the national conference and tide over the present 
difficulties and open the road of the country's peace and 
reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
[C.C.] of the Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea 
[UAWPK] proposed to the "National Federation of Peasant 
Associations" the "National Council of Peasant Organisations" 
and other peasant organisations of South Korea to hold a contact 
in Pyongyang or Seoul or Panmunjom for the discussion of the 
matter of convening a national conference. 
  This proposal was made by Choe Song-suk, chairperson of the 
C.C., the UAWPK, in a statement Friday. 
  A consultative meeting of representatives of the DPRK 
Government, political parties and public organisations which was 
held on May 25 urged the South Korean authorities to respond to 
the proposal for the convocation of a national conference and 
select South side's delegates to the preparatory committee of 
the conference at an early date, keeping pace with the North. 
  She said the peasant organisations of South Korea should 
launch brisk activities for an early selection of South side's 
delegates to the preparatory committee of the national 
conference and acceleration of the preparations for the 
conference. 
  "If the peasant organisations in the North and the South are 
to share the same view and achieve the unity of action in the 
efforts to convene the national conference, they must sit at one 
place, first of all, and come to an understanding", she said, 
adding: "The contact should not be wedded to a form. With the 
date set for the convocation of the national conference two 
months off, the sooner the better." 
  She expressed the hope that the peasant organisations of 
South Korea would show an affirmative response to the North's 
proposal for a bilateral contact.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The book "21st Century 
and Leader" is now being widely read by people in Seoul and 
Kyonggi Province, South Korea, according to radio Voice of 
National Salvation from Seoul. 
  The book deals with the greatness and leadership feats of 
the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  A professor Kim of Seoul National University said General 
Kim 
Chong-il is the leader of the 21st century. The earth moves 
around the dear leader Kim Chong-il who is the conning-tower of 
the era of independence and the world is advancing along the 
road indicated by him, the professor added. 
  Choe Sun-nam, a company clerk residing in Songdong district, 
Seoul, said he could hardly repress the national pride of 
holding General Kim Chong-il in esteem as the leader of the 21st 
century. National concord, the future of the reunified country 
and world peace lie in holding in high esteem the dear leader 
Kim Chong-il who is possessed of such leadership ability as 
universal gravitation with which he unites all the people into 
one with his magnanimous politics of love for and trust in the 
people, he said. 
  A writer Yi residing in Uijongbu city, Kyonggi Province, had 
this to say: 
  The dear leader Kim Chong-il is not only a great master of 
independent politics who has brilliantly carried into practice 
the anthropocentric chuche idea fathered by President Kim 
Il-song in the land of the northern half of Korea and built a 
paradise of the people, but also a peerless great man who is 
possessed of literary and military accomplishments, versatile 
talents and profound knowledge and popular virtues. 
  He wished the dear leader Kim Chong-il good health and a 
long 
life for the prospering 21st century.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The repatriation of Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop were 
demanded strongly in various countries. 
  The Russian committee for the promotion of the repatriation 
of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to the North and the release of An 
Hak-sop held an emergency meeting recently and sent a letter to 
Kim Yong-sam. 
  Noting that the South Korean authorities have kept old men 
Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan from returning to their hometowns 
where their families and relatives are waiting for them for more 
than 40 years, the letter urged Kim Yong-sam to return them to 
the DPRK, stop persecuting old man An Hak-sop at once and take a 
necessary measure so that he may live and work as he wishes. 
  Franco Akame, former chairman of the National Defence 
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, in a letter to 
the South Korean puppet ambassador to Italy demanded that the 
South Korean authorities immediately repatriate old men Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan to North Korea. 
  If the South Korean authorities persist in their inhumane 
treatment and tortures against unconverted long-term prisoners, 
not repatriating them, they would have to pay dearly for it, he 
warned in the letter.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls For Reviving Fighting Spirit of June </F>
Resistants" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary today says the desire of the fighters of the 
anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance in June 1987 for 
independence, democracy and reunification has yet not been 
realized in South Korea though seven years have passed since the 
resistance of the South Korean people. This is because of the 
U.S. policy of occupying South Korea and maintaining it as a 
colonial dependency, it adds. 
  The analyst says: 
  As long as South Korea remains a colony of the United States 
and fascist traitors stay in power, neither the desire of the 
people for a social change nor the reunification of the country 
can be achieved. This is the precious lesson gained by the June 
resistants and the South Korean people and the sum total of the 
struggle. 
  The South Korean students and people of all segments should 
wage a more valiant anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke struggle and 
build up fierce flames of massive resistance in all areas to 
overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish an 
independent and democratic government. 
  The South Korean people of all strata and Koreans overseas 
must wage a persistent nationwide struggle to reunify the 
country by the confederacy formula and, for the present, 
vigorously turn up in a joint struggle for the convocation of a 
national conference.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a 
letter to the international environmental organization 
Greenpeace supported its call for the total elimination of 
nuclear weapons, the Seoul-based Radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  Noting that the universal elimination of nuclear weapons 
must 
be realized at an early date for peace of mankind, the letter 
said: 
  To this end, the United States, "a chief nuclear culprit" 
which was the first in the world to develop and use nuclear 
weapons and, at present, has the largest number of them, must 
eliminate its nuclear weapons first and, for the present, 
withdraw all its nuclear weapons from South Korea and Northeast 
Asia. 
  The international reactionary forces including the United 
States must give up their dirty nuclear intrigue against the 
North, and the nuclear armament of South Korea and the Japanese 
authorities being promoted with their tacit approval must be 
stopped at once. 
  The letter said Hanminjon will always merge its voice of 
justice with the Greenpeace in active response to its just 
initiative and appeal and make all efforts to expand the 
movement for their realization everywhere Hanminjon is present 
and to all the governments, political parties and organizations 
with which it has contact.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
National Council of Representatives of Trade Unions (Chonnodae) 
at a press conference on June 8 declared that should railway 
workers go on strike, all the workers affiliated with it would 
take joint action, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  It also said it will take joint action in all work places of 
its affiliates all at once if its demand, such as the withdrawal 
of the proposed wage hike this year which was set by the 
"government"-subsidized "federation of trade unions," bowing to 
the authorities, and the reinstatement of dismissed workers, is 
not met.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The council of the 
South Korean Subway Trade Union on Thursday called a press 
conference and urged the puppet authorities to lift the wage 
ceiling, according to a radio report. 
  The trade union warned that it would launch into a general 
strike that would cause a total suspension of the operation of 
railways and subways throughout South Korea in case the present 
"regime" physically put down its demand as the past military 
regimes had done.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- Members of the National 
Alliance for Democracy and Reunification (Chongukyonhap) and the 
South Korean Federation of General Student Councils 
(Hanchongnyon), more than 4,000 in all, held an all-people 
memorial service for those who fell while fighting for the 
nation and democracy at the amphitheatre of the Hanyang 
University on June 11, a Seoul-based radio reported. 
  In his opening address, Yi Chang-pok, permanent chairman of 
Chongukyonhap, charged that "the present Kim Yong-sam 
`government' is totally blocking democratisation and 
reunification" and called for an all-people movement to check 
"the parliamentary ratification of the final act of the Uruguay 
Round world trade accord" and demanded a peaceful solution to 
the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  Then, a rally marking the June resistance anniversary was 
held to inherit the spirit of the martyrs. 
  The ralliers vowed to fulfil the tasks to realise a genuine 
democracy and independent reunification on the occasion of the 
7th anniversary of the resistance.

  [Text] According to Japan's NHK broadcast, Ozawa, 
representative secretary of Japan Renewal Party, seized upon the 
fictitious issue of our nuclear development and made provocative 
remarks on a Fuji television broadcast, that the international 
community should deal with the issue resolutely, and that Japan 
should cooperate naturally if the United Nations adopts a 
resolution calling for sanctions. Ozawa went so far as to 
openly rave that the Japanese Government should take a series of 
steps for sanctions even before the United Nations adopts a 
resolution. 
  This shows how desperately and frantically the Japanese 
reactionaries are committed to sanctions against us at the front 
of the international alliance led by the United States. 
  The remarks by Ozawa, which is a grave infringement on our 
republic, an independent sovereign state, are an intolerable 
criminal act that drives the extremely strained military 
situation on the Korean peninsula onto the threshold of war. 
  The Japanese reactionaries raved about taking the lead in 
taking sanctions against us at a time when the International 
Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors adopted an absurd 
resolution on the suspension of the agency's cooperation with 
our country and when the United States and its followers are 
persistently attempting sanctions through the United Nations. 
This is a very grave development in the situation and proves 
that Japan's hostile policy against our republic has reached an 
extreme.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 12 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- A 
Tokyo metropolitan meeting of Koreans in Japan took place on 
June 11 to protest the Japanese authorities' unjustifiable 
suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and national persecution. 
  In his report at the meeting Pae Pyong-tu, vice-chairman of 
the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and concurrently 
chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of Chongnyon, 
condemned the Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and 
said all the branches, chapters, organizations and enterprises 
of Chongnyon should put spurs on the "each-visit-100 family 
drive" with this meeting as an occasion, going deep among the 
compatriots and uniting them and arousing them to the struggle 
to smash the crackdown on Chongnyon. 
  Nachiko Aoki, vice-chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan 
headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party and member of 
the Tokyo metropolitan assembly, and other Japanese figures in 
their solidarity addresses to the meeting vowed to strive 
actively to eliminate discriminations against Korean residents 
in Japan and prevent a recurrence of human rights abuses in the 
Japan society. 
  Koreans of various strata under the Tokyo metropolitan 
headquarters said in their indignation speeches that they would 
firmly unite with compatriots and turn out as one in the 
struggle to safeguard the socialist homeland of chuche and the 
Chongnyon organization and defend the rights of compatriots 
under the wise guidance of the dear leader Marshal Kim Chong-il. 
  A protest message to the Japanese prime minister was adopted 
at the meeting. 
  Earlier, on June 10, a Kyoto prefectural meeting of Koreans 
in Japan took place to denounce the Japanese authorities' 
political suppression of the Kyoto organization of Chongnyon and 
national persecution.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Osaka prefectural 
police and the Higashi Police Station of Japan are getting all 
the more arrogant, ignoring the strong protest by the Koreans in 
Japan and public opinion at home and abroad, according to CHOSON 
SINBO. 
  The paper said the Osaka prefectural police, far from 
apologizing for its criminal acts, let out a stream of 
provocative words at officials of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans, shouting 
"Chongnyon of Korea, break up your protest action" and "we will 
arrest you, if you stay any longer". 
  The rampage of the Japanese right-wing gangsters is assuming 
greater intensity, coupled with the arrogance of the Japanese 
police. 
  On the 6th of June, they appeared around the prefectural 
police bureau and the Higashi Police Station where Koreans were 
staging a protest and made a fuss, shouting "away with Koreans." 
  On the 7th, right-wing gangsters belonging to the "League of 
Asian Nations" came with an armoured vehicle and a loudspeaker 
car and threatened Koreans who were staging a protest, uttering 
uncleanly words unfit for human mouth. 
  The suppression by the Japanese reactionaries has lashed the 
Koreans in Japan into fury.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Central Guidance 
Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association in a statement 
June 13 strongly urged the Japanese authorities to immediately 
stop their crackdown on the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and 
apologize for it and punish those responsible for the recent 
criminal acts. 
  "The recent crackdown on the Osaka and Kyoto prefectural 
headquarters of Chongnyon was a fascist outrage designed to 
totally suppress Chongnyon, part of their premeditated anti-DPRK 
moves encouraged by the U.S. manoeuvres to isolate and stifle 
the DPRK over its fictitious `nuclear issue', and a grave 
challenge to the DPRK, an independent and sovereign state," the 
statement says, and goes on: 
  "The Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist 
Association sternly denounces the Japanese police outrages in 
the name of the entire Chondoists of the DPRK, branding them as 
rash acts of murderers, fascist maniacs to commit a second Kanto 
massacre. 
  "We will consider any suppression of Chongnyon to be an 
encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of our republic and 
decisively counter it. 
  "If the Japanese authorities persist in their crackdown on 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, they would be held wholly 
responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom." 
  The statement expresses the hope that the South Korean 
Chondoists and Tangun Taejonggyo believers too would turn out in 
the struggle to defend the dignity of their resourceful nation 
and check the Japanese reactionaries' suppression of Koreans in 
Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) is under fire in different 
countries. 
  The Ghanaian National Institute of the Chuche Idea in a 
letter of protest to the Japanese prime minister June 3 said the 
Japanese authorities' search of Chongnyon, a legitimate 
organisation of overseas citizens of the DPRK, with the 
mobilisation of huge police and even their unhesitating murder 
and violence are a politically motivated sinister inhumane act. 
  Noting that this was an anti-human political suppression the 
like of which could hardly be seen in the history of the world, 
the letter demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately 
stop suppressing Chongnyon organisations, apologize for their 
encroachment on the legitimate rights of Koreans in Japan and 
fully guarantee their political rights and freedom regulated 
under the publicly recognized international law. 
  The chairman of the Denmark-DPRK Friendship Association in a 
letter of protest to the Japanese Government May 31 denounced 
the Japanese authorities for suppressing Chongnyon as part of 
their campaign against the DPRK and stepping up the anti-DPRK 
campaign in league with international reactionaries, and urged 
them to stop it at once.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon), an organization of the movement for 
the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, reportedly 
held its presidium meeting in Tokyo recently and adopted a 
resolution to implement the program of the movement which had 
been agreed and decided on at a meeting of the joint presidium 
of Pomminnyon. 
  The resolution said the meeting discussed the issue of 
promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country by forming strong units based on great national unity to 
counter outside forces, the United States and Japan, and the 
South Korean puppet clique that are trying to make a dangerous 
adventure under the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue." 
  It called on all the regional headquarters overseas to 
actively take part in the movement of "10,000 people's 
declaration" with a view to strongly urging the United States to 
observe the conclusions reached at its talks with the DPRK, 
rallying the forces of the whole nation to smash Japan's scheme 
to become a military power and having the Korean Armistice 
Agreement replaced with a peace agreement. 
  The resolution also called for making efforts to 
successfully 
hold the fifth pan-national rally slated for this year as a 
great festival of the whole nation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
Prominent figures of Japan including political scientist Takeshi 
Ishida and lawyer Tsukuo Imamura met the speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the chairman of the House of Councillors on 
June 2 and handed them a letter urging the adoption of a special 
Diet resolution on Japan's responsibility for the war and 
apology and the establishment of an ad hoc committee for the 
investigation into postwar compensation. 
  Recalling that many Asian people were killed in Japan's war 
of aggression, they strongly demanded a thoroughgoing 
investigation into the outstanding issue of postwar compensation 
including the forcible drafting of Koreans and the issue of 
"comfort women for the army", the publication of its results and 
the clarification of the responsibility. 
  They said that the Diet should immediately adopt a special 
resolution on the responsibility for the war and apology with 
the approval of both houses and apologize for Japan's past 
crimes.

  [Text] The Ministry of People's Armed Forces arranged a 
banquet for a high-level military delegation of Vietnam, which 
is visiting our country, at the Mansudae Assembly Hall on the 
evening of 14 June. 
  Invited at the banquet were delegates led by General Doan 
Khue, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of 
Vietnam and minister of national defense, and Duong Chinh Thuc, 
Vietnamese ambassador to our country. 
  Comrade O Chin-u, member of the Presidium of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] and minister of People's Armed Forces; Kim Kwang-chin, 
vice marshal of the Korean People's Army [KPA]; Col. Gen. Pak 
Chae-kyong; Lt. Gen. Pak Sung-won; and other generals and 
officers of the KPA were also on hand. 
  Comrade O Chin-u made a speech at the banquet. He warmly 
welcomed the delegation's visit to our country and said that its 
recent visit will serve as a momentum in promoting traditional 
relations of cooperation and friendship between the two 
countries onto a higher stage. 
  He said that the fraternal Vietnamese people and army are 
invariably marching along the road of socialism which they 
themselves chose, and are achieving great results in the 
struggle for building prosperous socialist Vietnam and 
strengthening the country's defense power, by upholding the will 
of President Ho Chi Minh. He said that they were very pleased 
with this and hoped that greater results would be achieved in 
the course of future struggle. 
  Comrade O Chin-u pointed out that our people and the 
officers 
and men of the army are overflowing with confidence and optimism 
that we will be ever-victorious as long as the supreme commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership exists as they strive 
vigorously for socialist construction and for the independent, 
peaceful reunification of the country. 
  He said that the United States and its follower forces are 
intensifying more than ever before, anti-Republic maneuvers to 
isolate and crush our country's socialist system by finding 
fault with the fictitious nuclear issue of ours. He also said 
the government of our Republic took self-defense measures of 
immediately withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] and no longer allowing any inspections against the 
IAEA Secretariat's shameless maneuvers of demanding the agency's 
overall [chonmyon] inspections with the threat of sanctions. 
  He stressed that our people and the officers and men of the 
People's Army will defend, adhere to, and develop, the popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own-style under the wise 
leadership of the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, and 
will unfailingly realize the historic cause of national 
reunification. Our people will accelerate the socialist 
construction of the two countries, will fight with the fraternal 
Vietnamese people to build an independent, peaceful, and 
prosperous great Asia, and, on this course, will make positive 
efforts to strengthen and develop friendly relations with 
Vietnam, he said. 
  Next, National Defense Minister Doan Khue made a speech. He 
expressed gratitude for the warm welcome given to the 
delegation. Saying that Vietnam and the DPRK are socialist 
countries which have a tradition of friendly relations formed by 
the respected Comrade President Ho Chi Minh and the respected 
Comrade President Kim Il-song, he stated that the two countries 
have supported and helped each other in the arduous yet glorious 
struggle for national independence, the country's reunification, 
and socialist construction. 
  National Defense Minister Doan Khue said that today's 
situation calls on Vietnam and the DPRK to be firmly united in 
the struggle against the imperialists' plot to terminate 
socialism. He said that we were happy about the great results 
achieved by the DPRK people and the People's Army in the 
struggle to lay the material basis for socialism and to 
peacefully reunify the country without the interference of 
outside forces, and under the leadership of the WPK headed by 
the respected Comrade President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the supreme commander of the KPA. 
  He said he firmly believes that the DPRK people and the 
People's Army, with their steel-like conviction, and energetic 
and creative labor, will overcome all sorts of difficulties and 
trials, and achieve a new result in the struggle for socialist 
construction and the country's independent, peaceful 
reunification. 
  Saying that he is happy that the people of the two countries 
have strengthened and developed friendship and unity in the 
past, he emphasized that this has contributed to consolidating 
cooperation and development not only between the two countries, 
but also in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. He said that 
the delegation's recent visit to the DPRK will contribute to 
further promote friendship and unity between the people and army 
of the two countries. 
  The participants of the banquet proposed a toast for the 
fraternal friendship and unity between the people and army of 
the DPRK and Vietnam; for the long life of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song; for the long life of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander of the KPA; for the 
long life of General Secretary Do Muoi; and for the long life of 
the respected Comrade President Le Duc Anh.

express firm solidarity with the Libyan Arab people in their 
just cause for defending the sovereignty of the country on the 
occasion of the anniversary of the dismantlement of the U.S.

  The article says: 
  Through the dismantlement of the U.S. military bases the 
Libyan Arab people showed that the strength of the people who 
value their national dignity and sovereignty of their country is 
tremendous. 
  Today the Libyan Arab people steadfastly maintain the stand 
of independence against imperialism. This enjoys sympathy and

  The imperialists are persisting in their pressure and 
interference against Libya which is advancing along the road of 
independence, regarding it as a thorn in their flesh. But they 
could not break down the will of the Libyan Arab people. 
  The Libyan Arab people are firmly safeguarding their

Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great September 
first revolution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Immortal Achievements To </F>
Strengthen and Develop Our Party To Be the Chuche Revolutionary 
Party"] 
  [Text] The Workers Party of Korea [WPK] has been 
strengthened and developed to be the chuche revolutionary party, 
an ever-victorious invincible revolutionary party, and is 
vigorously leading our people's cause of independence, the 
socialist cause, today. Our party is excellently carrying out 
its mission and duty as a guide of the cause of socialism 
because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has strengthened 
and developed our party to be the chuche revolutionary party for 
the past 30 years since he began to lead our party's work, 
regarding the party's leadership as a life line of the cause of 
socialism. 
  Throughout the entire period of leading the revolution and 
construction, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published 
many immortal classic works and gave perfect answers to the 
theoretical and practical problems arising in building the 
working-class party. With outstanding and tested leadership, he 
led the cause of building our party to a shining victory. 
  The achievements by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in 
the cause of our party building are the greatest of the immortal 
achievements he has made in the revolution and construction. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our party 
has firmly adhered to the principles of revolutionary party 
building and thoroughly embodied them in party building and 
party activities, thereby pioneering a new road of party 
building and strengthening and developing our party to be the 
chuche revolutionary party that we have today. 
  The wisdom of the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il with which he has strengthened and developed the WPK 
into the chuche revolutionary party of invincible might lies in 
his putting forth the policy of modeling the entire party 
membership on the chuche idea in conformity with the inevitable 
demand of the party's development and energetically leading the 
struggle for its realization. Modeling the entire party 
membership on the chuche idea is the revolutionary party 
building program that makes all the party members who compose 
the party enthusiastic chuche-type revolutionaries, firmly 
builds the party ranks, and conducts the party work and party 
activities thoroughly as required by the chuche ideology, 
theory, and method, thus strengthening and developing our party 
forever to be the chuche revolutionary party. 
  Modeling the entire party membership on the chuche idea is 
the general objective of our party building, and comprehensively 
summed up therein are the strategic task, mission, and method of 
our party building. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the 
sacred struggle to model the entire party membership on the 
chuche idea and made great achievements in the cause of party 
building. The achievement the dear comrade leader has made in 
strengthening our party is, more than anything else, his 
bringing up all the party members to be the core elements of the 
revolution and firmly building the party ranks into the militant 
ranks of the chuche-type revolutionaries. 
  The dear comrade leader firmly established the party's 
monolithic ideological system by defining the basic line of 
party building and saw to it that all the party organizations 
persistently keep up and continuously deepen the work. As the 
party's monolithic ideological system has been established under 
the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, all 
the party members have been armed more firmly with the chuche 
idea, and the chuche ideological system has been firmly 
established in the party. 
  The dear comrade leader originally defined the basic duties, 
contents, and method of the party's ideological work in 
conformity with the prevailing development of modeling the 
entire society on the chuche idea, and energetically led the 
work, thus bringing up all party members to be the core elements 
of the revolution. 
  Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, a new 
change has been brought forth in the party's ideological work, 
and the party is filled with the revolutionary ethos of 
cherishing loyalty as one's revolutionary faith and fidelity, 
protecting and defending the party and the leader politically, 
ideologically, and at the cost of one's life, and implementing 
the party's line and policy unconditionally to the end, prepared 
to face any hardship. 
  Another of the achievements the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il made in strengthening our party is that he has realized 
the party's ideological volitional unity and cohesion at the 
highest level. Realizing the party's unity and cohesion is the 
task of key significance in the revolutionary party building, 
and it is an important problem that determines the fate of the 
party and the success of the revolution. 
  Always giving priority to strengthening the party's unity 
and cohesion in party building, the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il has brilliantly realized it under the uplifted banner 
of unity. 
  The unity and cohesion our party achieved today are 
invincible ones that have made complete, unconditional unity in 
ideology, volition, and action, upholding the great leader and 
the dear comrade leader as the center of unity. Thanks to the 
great unity and cohesion, our party is vigorously pushing ahead 
with the socialist cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, as the 
vanguard of revolution. 
  Another of the achievements the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il made in consolidating the party is that he has 
thoroughly established the revolutionary work system and iron 
discipline within the party. Setting up the well-arranged work 
system and iron discipline within the party is a significant 
demand of principle arising in the revolutionary party building. 
When the well- arranged work system and iron discipline are 
set up within the party, the party's militant might can be 
strengthened in every way and the party can triumphantly fulfill 
its duty and mission as a guide of socialism and communism. 
  Judging that establishing the revolutionary party work 
system 
is one of the basic problems in enhancing the party's militant 
role and function, and iron organizational discipline within the 
party, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has brilliantly 
solved this problem. 
  Ceaselessly changing the method of work in accordance with a 
new party work system comes up as an issue of principle in 
building the working-class party. Party work and party 
activities can be realized through the method of work, and 
establishing the revolutionary method of work is of significance 
in setting up the party work system. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has set forth an unique 
line of carrying out the work with people as a key party work, 
and let all problems arising in party building and party 
activities be solved through the work with people and the 
organizational, political work. The dear comrade leader has 
thoroughly embodied the chuche work system and the great 
leader-way work system initiated by respected and beloved leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song and thus made the great leader's idea and 
leadership be brilliantly realized in party work and party 
activities. 
  Paying close attention to setting up anti-Japanese guerrilla 
work method in the entire party, the dear comrade leader has 
energetically led to improve the work method of the party 
organizations and functionaries. As the result of establishing 
anti-Japanese guerrilla work method, the revolutionary work 
ethos of which functionaries, like commanders of anti-Japanese 
guerrilla, go down to the producer masses with a strapsack on 
their back; live and work with them; seek a right methodology to 
the problem with them for the realization of the presented task; 
and set out on work in a big way and push it ahead audaciously. 
Hence, the party's features have been newly changed and the 
party's method of work and ethos have been fundamentally renewed. 
  In this way, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has sought 
all keys of victory in strengthening the party in the entire 
course of leading the work of revolutionary struggle and 
construction. He has also achieved brilliant accomplishments in 
implementing the cause of building our party by strengthening 
the party ideologically, organizationally. 
  The problem of inheriting the party's revolutionary cause 
has 
been brilliantly solved. This is the most proud victory 
achieved by the cause of building our party. Amid the struggle 
for modelling the entire membership on the chuche idea, the 
governing body of the party has been firmly strengthened to 
inherit our party's idea and leadership, the party's 
organizational, ideological basis has been firmly consolidated, 
and the party's system of leadership has been established. In 
doing so, our party has been further strengthened as a great 
party with absolute authority and prestige. 
  Truly, thanks to the tested and excelled leadership of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who glorifies the 
chuche-oriented cause for party building from generation to 
generation, the WPK has been today developed and strengthened as 
the chuche-typed party. This is the greatest of the immortal 
achievements he made before the times and revolution.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- A seminar of pressmen 
took place in Pyongyang on the lapse of 30 years since the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work in the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  The speakers said the dear leader, with a deep insight into 
the great role of news media in the revolutionary struggle, has 
attached particular importance to the publication and 
information services and led them since he began his work in the 
party Central Committee. 
  They said the undying feats performed by him in guiding the 
publication and information services are that he provided a 
great guideline for the building of revolutionary news media of 
the working class by putting forward a chuche-based idea and 
theories on the publication and information services, kindled 
the flames of revolutionization of newspapers, news services and 
publications and established a revolutionary work system of the 
press media. 
  They pointed out that at a time when news media of some 
countries have been reduced to guides on the frustration of 
socialism and their return to capitalism, giving in to the 
bourgeois ideological offensive of the imperialists and 
reactionaries, the news media of the DPRK are serving as 
triumphant drumbeats in the noble struggle to resolutely defend 
the party and the leader and safeguard and glorify the socialist 
bastion under the banner of the chuche idea. They added that 
this is entirely results of the wise guidance of the dear leader 
who put forward a great chuche-based programme of the press and 
led the struggle to carry it into reality.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Coal is called "food" 
of industry in Korea. 
  The history of socialist economic construction in the 
country 
began with developing coal resources and upgrading coal 
industry. The state defined the coal industry as one of the 
domains that should be kept ahead of other domains of the 
national economy and has all along directed big efforts to it. 
  In the 1970s when most countries around the world were 
depending on oil in industrial development Korea developed the 
industrial sectors feeding on the rich domestic coal resources 
as its fuel, raw material and power resources, thus building a 
powerful independent national economy. The state has increased 
the production capacity of the existing coal mines 3.5 times 
over the past 30 years by steadily increasing investments in the 
coal industry. And it has constructed 40 odd coal mines and 
over 50 pits in promising areas. 
  The coal industry is now turning out in a few days as much 
coal as was produced in the whole year of 1946. 
  Korea produced 27.5 million tons of coal in 1970 to reach 
the 
level of the developed industrial states in the coal output per 
head of the population in those days. The annual output hit 
the 85 million ton mark in the 1980s. 
  The rapid development of industry resulted in the ever 
increasing demand for coal. With a view to satisfying the 
demand for coal, the state put forward the task to boost the 
coal output 30 percent in the adjustment period (1994-1996). 
Big efforts are being made nationwide to hit the goal. 
  New coal deposits have been found in different parts of the 
country. With the discovery of promising coal deposits in 
Yanggang Province which has been dependent on other areas for 
coal, prospects have opened for meeting the local demand by 
itself. 
  The construction of new coal mines and pits is progressing 
and undertakings to carry out a comprehensive mechanization of 
pit work are gathering momentum. 
  The laying of a belt conveyor line to increase the transport 
capacity in the pits of Yongdung, Changan, Sochang and Sunchon 
area coal mines and a project to increase production capacity of 
the Kangdong area coal mines have reached the final stage. 
  Work is making a successful progress to move up the date of 
commissioning of the coal mines and pits under construction in 
Anju and the northern region and to complete the comprehensive 
mechanisation of pit work at the June 13 coal mine, the Hakpo 
coal mine, etc.

  [Text] The Australian foreign minister, Senator Gareth 
Evans, has urged the United Nations Security Council to be 
careful about any decision directed at North Korea. Speaking in 
Manila, Senator Evans said the situation needs to be handled 
delicately. Trevor Watson reports. 
  [Begin Watson recording] Senator Evans said he would deplore 
any decision that drives the North Koreans beyond the point of 
no return in their dealings with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency or the world community. Nobody, he said, knows if 
sanctions will do that or encourage the North to be more open in 
the future. 
  [Evans] Will it serve the purpose of keeping them committed 
in the future to ensure that we at least know there won't be 
diversion of nuclear material in the future, or we would be the 
trigger which in fact pushes them over the brink to walk away 
from the non-proliferation treaty all together. [end recording]

  [Text] Sydney, May 27 (AFP) -- Australian trade with Asia 
continued its rapid growth of previous years in 1993 as exports 
to the region surged nine percent to 40 billion dollars (29 
billion US), according to official data released Friday. 
  A six-monthly trade analysis by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs also showed a 17.5 percent rise in exports of 
elaborately transformed manufactures (ETMs) to the world, 
dominated by a 30 percent increase to Asia. 
  Japan remained Australia's largest export market, accounting 
for almost a quarter of total merchandise exports worth 15.6 
billion dollars. 
  At the same time, Australia imported 11.8 billion dollars 
worth of goods from Japan, resulting in a trade surplus of 3.8 
billion dollars. 
  Australia's total merchandise trade rose by 10 percent in 
current dollar terms to 125 billion dollars, with eight percent 
export growth and a 12 percent increase in imports, the report 
said. 
  Coal remained the biggest commodity export, representing 
12.3 
percent of Australia's total merchandise exports. 
  "While merchandise trade recorded another surplus -- 454 
million in 1993 -- the relative strength of imports has reduced 
it substantially from the high of four billion dollars in 1991 
and the 1992 level of nearly three billion dollars," the report 
said. 
  It attributed the fall in the surplus to a decline in the 
terms of trade, associated with continued weakness in world 
commodity prices, increased demand for imports flowing from the 
relatively strong@rate of domestic recovery and subdued economic 
activity in a number of key export markets. 
  Exports to the United States dropped in 1993 by about one 
percent, while US imports grew by seven percent, increasing the 
trade surplus in favour of the United States to 8.1 billion 
dollars. 
  During the same period exports to European Union countries 
also fell by three percent while imports from the EU grew by 
eight percent, the trade imbalance worsening for Australia to 
6.4 billion dollars. 
  A statement released by Trade Minister Bob McMullan's office 
said the figures clearly indicated the government's closer 
integration with Asia was paying dividends in the form of 
increased export earnings. 
  Exports to the East Asia region, including Japan, Korea, 
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the Association of South East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 
the Philippines and Thailand -- increased by eight percent to 37 
billion dollars.

<F P=106> ["Last Part" of report compiled by National Assembly </F>
Standing Committee on voters' views submitted to the Ninth 
National Assembly's fifth session] 
  [Text] Concerning the wage system, voters in many 
localities asked the government to continue its efforts to study 
and improve the wage system to make it just and rational. 
Voters in many localities hold that the reclassification of 
compensation plans for competent cadres and retirees in 
accordance with Decree No. 05-CP, dated 26 January 1994, is 
irrational because it does not reflect good care for the 
retirees. Besides, the wide coefficient between wages for 
active civil servants and the pension for the retirees 
represents an unfair situation. All voters in localities raised 
issues related to the policy toward local cadres and held that 
since the application of Decree No. 46-CP, various villages have 
experienced numerous difficulties. The streamlining of 
personnel and the limitation of expenditures for village cadres 
and activities of mass organizations at the grassroots level are 
not appropriate because it creates a bad feeling for the local 
cadres who have made great contributions to the people. The 
fact that many key cadres at the grassroots level resigned has 
caused confusion in the social life of localities. Many voters 
suggested that the National Assembly should question the 
minister concerned and chairman of the Government's Cadre 
Organization Committee regarding the promulgation of Decree No. 
46-CP. The voters held that this decree was not in conformity 
with the party's line on consolidating and strengthening the 
local administration. Voters of the education sector expressed 
their indignation in the reclassification of the compensation 
plan. They said that this has created an unfair condition in the 
promotion process because in the past one only needed three 
years to get a step increase, now they have to wait for six 
years. 
  Regarding social policy, most voters expressed concern over 
the unemployment problem. Voters in provinces and cities said 
that a large number of youth in cities and the rural areas are 
jobless. This is a direct cause leading to social vices such as 
gambling, drug addiction, prostitution, and theft. The voters 
suggested that the state invest more in programs to resolve the 
unemployment problem, considering this an important measure to 
stop social vices. Many voters held that efforts to send 
Vietnamese workers abroad is the state's correct policy aimed at 
resolving the unemployment issue at home. However, the 
government should take essential measures and reach agreements 
with foreign countries to protect the interests of Vietnamese 
workers abroad. Many voters paid keen interest in the policy 
toward wounded soldiers, families of the fallen combatants, and 
those who have contributed meritorious services to the state. 
Most voters held that the present allowances for families of 
fallen combatants are too low. They suggested that the state 
should formulate a better policy toward those who have made 
great contributions to the state to maintain the principle of 
gratitude while educating the younger generation and developing 
the fine tradition of our nation. 
  Voters throughout the country welcomed the party and state 
lines in solemnly organizing our nation's major anniversaries, 
including the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Dien 
Bien Phu victory. The voters held that the solemn commemoration 
of the Dien Bien Phu victory created a significant impact in the 
feeling of all Vietnamese. Voters in many localities asked the 
state to promulgate a regulation on treatment for those who have 
performed meritorious service for the state. They said that 
they have asked for this regulation on many occasions; however, 
their request was ignored. They also asked that when the state 
completes the draft regulation on this issue, it should be made 
public to solicit the people's ideas. 
  IV. Implementation of the National Assembly's resolution on 
practicing thrift, opposing waste and corruption, and 
suppressing smuggling. 
  All voters in localities welcomed the National Assembly's 
resolution on this issue, which was adopted at the Ninth 
National Assembly's fourth session. The voters highly appraised 
the National Assembly's determination in the struggle against 
lavish spending of state budget, corruption, and smuggling which 
are the pressing issues at present. Many voters noted that the 
government has made great efforts in implementing the National 
Assembly's resolution. However, results attained in this regard 
are low while social vices tended to increase in various 
meticulous forms. Voters commended Dong Nai, Song Be, and Tay 
Ninh Provinces for their efforts in dealing with car smuggling 
cases. The press recently reported, however, that the 
government has not taken prompt action against a number of 
business units that imported motorcycles without proper 
permission. The voters held that efforts to suppress corruption 
and smuggling is an important, yet very difficult task. As a 
result, the state should formulate more concrete and effective 
measures to deal with this issue while urging state agencies 
from the central to grassroots levels to seriously oppose 
corruption and smuggling. Voters in some localities suggested 
that the state should review the organization of the Steering 
Committee for Opposing Corruption and Smuggling because low 
results were obtained in this task. Many voters suggested that 
the National Assembly should set up a special committee to 
review verdicts of some cases which were still questioned by the 
people and to speed up investigation of pending cases, and that 
the National Assembly should formulate law or regulations on 
opposing corruption and smuggling. 
  Voters in many localities suggested that the state review 
policies and regulations aimed at eliminating officialism and 
procedures that lead to annoyances and extortion. Efforts 
should be made to simplify and publicize the procedures for 
issuing driving permits and registration for car and motorbike 
owners. 
  Voters in many provinces and cities also suggested that 
during the fifth session the National Assembly deputies need to 
consider and evaluate the recent situation through practicing 
thrift and combating corruption and smuggling. Voters in some 
localities suggested that in order to implement the National 
Assembly's resolution on practicing thrift and combating 
corruption and smuggling, there should be a motivational 
campaign for the masses with good coordination between criticism 
and suppression. Importance should be attached to the tasks of 
law building; avoiding redundant, conflicting, or inconsistent 
laws and regulations; and solving conflicts between economic 
interests and responsibilities. 
<H5>  Voters' Opinions on the National Assembly's Legislative </H5>
Tasks. 
  According to the reports of provincial National Assembly 
deputy groups, voters acknowledge the National Assembly's 
efforts in its law building activities. The large number of 
laws passed in 1993 -- such as the law on land, the law on tax 
on agricultural land use, the law on oil and gas, the law on 
business bankruptcy, and the draft laws to be passed in the 
National Assembly's current fifth session -- are proof of the 
National Assembly's good performance of its legislative 
function, thus contributing actively to building a law-governed 
state in socialist Vietnam. 
  Voters, however, expressed great concern over ineffective 
law 
enforcement. They think one cause is the lack of guidance, 
education, and mass motivation in law enforcement. Voters 
suggested that adequate funds should be allocated to law 
education campaigns and effective measures should be developed 
to consolidate and clean up agencies in charge of investigation, 
prosecution, and jurisdiction. 
  Voters in many provinces and cities held that the 
publication 
of draft laws in the print media -- giving people the chance to 
voice their opinions and suggestions -- is evidence of the 
democratic and popular characteristics of legislative work, 
making it a regular political activity of the people. Many 
discussion sessions were held at all levels -- resident groups, 
hamlets, villages, districts, cities, and so forth -- with tens 
of thousands of attendees offering many valuable and useful 
suggestions. 
  In addition, in the campaign to solicit voters' suggestions 
for the National Assembly's current fifth session, the following 
suggestions were raised by many voters: 
  -- Draft laws should be publicized early and the 
discussion time should be increased so that voters have the 
appropriate time to study them. 
  -- Along with the publication of draft laws in newspapers, 
there should be additional guiding documents to make the 
discussions more effective and of better quality. 
  -- Before a decision is made to amend a law, the law 
should be reviewed to check for provisions that are no longer 
suitable. 
  -- Voters in some localities expressed concern over the 
draft amendment to the law on organization and election of 
people's councils and people's committees. They submit that 
several provisions in the draft contradict the 1992 
Constitution. Some voters think that the new draft is not as 
good as some other drafts that were brought up for discussion 
before. 
<H5>  Voters' General Opinions on National Assembly Activities. </H5>
  Most voters expressed delight at the constant improvement of 
the National Assembly's activities. They held that the National 
Assembly has performed its legislative function well in the 
recent past and has tried to improve its supervisory role. 
Deputies' activities have also changed for the better. 
Deputies have shown a high sense of responsibility, maintained 
regular and close contact with the people, and listened 
carefully to the people's opinions and aspirations. 
  Voters in many localities, however, suggested that the 
National Assembly should strive to strengthen its controlling 
and supervisory roles, especially over the two important 
National Assembly resolutions passed by the fourth session -- on 
tasks for 1994 and on practicing thrift and combating corruption 
and smuggling activities. At each session, the National Assembly 
should review and evaluate the implementation of its resolutions 
so that it can develop suitable measures to improve 
implementation. 
  The task of the National Assembly deputies and provincial 
deputies groups to meet with voters has become more effective 
and regular. They still think that deputies need to improve and 
reform their communication with voters for the sake of better 
quality and greater efficiency. 
<H5>  Other Issues. </H5>
  According to the reports of the provincial deputy groups 
from 
Ha Tay, Ha Bac, and Vinh Phu, the voters repeated their petition 
to split their provinces. 
  The above is a summarized report on the opinions and 
suggestions made by voters nationwide to the National Assembly. 
The National Assembly Standing Committee solemnly submits this 
report to the deputies and deputy groups.

  [Summary] The fifth session of the Ninth National Assembly 
entered its 17th day today. 
  "In the morning, the deputies continued to discuss the 
situation regarding the implementation of the socioeconomic plan 
for the first six months of 1994 and the socioeconomic tasks for 
the last six months of the year. The morning session was 
directed by National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan. 
  "In financial and monetary matters, all those who spoke 
expressed their concern about the status of budget revenue and 
expenditure. Some deputies suggested that we should carry on 
the policy of promoting increased savings among the people by 
increasing the interest rate for savings accounts and 
encouraging enterprises to increase production in order to 
generate new sources of revenue." 
  Many deputies raised the question of how to vigorously shift 
agricultural production to the manufacture of marketable 
products. 
  Others called for economic development in mountainous areas. 
They asked the state to take practical measures in terms of 
capital, market, and transportation. 
  "In terms of capital construction, many deputies called for 
a 
review of the 1994 program for capital construction and those 
projects which are still left unfinished from past years." 
  Some deputies observed that "the present accounting system 
in 
our country is only suited to the subsidy-based economic 
management system because it does not take into account profits 
or losses. It must, therefore, be revised to suit the market 
system." 
  In addition to the observations about improving cultural and 
artistic activities, "many deputies continued to raise the 
warning about a failure to resolve several social ills such as 
opium smoking, drug addiction, prostitution, and about the 
danger of many video and movie films being illicitly imported 
and many books dating back from the old regime being reprinted." 
  They also expressed worries about the degradation of public 
health and the education system and about the shortage of 
Level-1 and level-2 school teachers and medical personnel for 
mountainous regions. 
  They pointed out that "It is the desire of the people to see 
the government strictly maintain law and order, positively carry 
out thrift, fight corruption and smuggling, and take stern 
actions against those who take advantage of the renovation 
policy in enriching themselves illegitimately or working against 
national order and discipline." 
  This afternoon, the National Assembly continued to work 
under 
the direction of Chairman Nong Duc Manh. 
  Various cabinet members answered questions raised by 
deputies. They included: 
  -- Mr. Do Quoc San, minister of state and head of the State 
Planning Commission, who answered a question about the 
implementation of Project 327 on covering bare hills with 
greenery. 
  -- "Mr. Ho Te, minister of finance, who answered a question 
about the situation regarding budget revenue and expenditure. 
He explained various measures aimed at promoting increased 
revenue during the final months of the year such as guarding 
against tax collection shortfalls, seeking local and foreign 
loans, and economizing on spending in order to balance revenue 
and expenditure." 
  -- "Mr. Hoang Duc Nghi, minister and head of the 
Nationalities and Mountain Region Committee, who answered 
questions about the supply of essential commodities to mountain 
regions, and about the outcome of an opium control program." 
  -- Mr. Nguyen Quang Ha, minister of agriculture, who 
answered 
a question about the outcome of the implementation of Prime 
Minister's Directive 525 and Program 327 on the delivery of 
forests and forest land [to local peasants for management]. 
  "Tomorrow, the National Assembly will continue work at the 
Conference Hall."

  [Text] This morning the National Assembly deputies worked 
at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall under the direction of Chairman 
Nong Duc Manh. Members of the government cabinet continued to 
answer questions raised by National Assembly deputies on the 
implementation of socioeconomic tasks in the first six months of 
the year and plans for the next six months. 
  Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, war invalids, and social 
welfare answered questions on the calculation of pensions for 
retired cadres, pensions and allowances for wounded soldiers, 
death benefits for survivors of war dead, allowances for cadres 
and soldiers [formerly] on combat duty in the south leaving 
families behind without support, and wage scales for cadres of 
education and medical agencies at the grassroots level. 
  On the issue of spontaneous immigration, Minister Tran Dinh 
Hoan revealed major measures that the Ministry of Labor, War 
Invalids, and Social Welfare are applying, including the setting 
up of new economic zones projects in areas with many spontaneous 
immigrants already settled there or in areas to which they like 
to move. On the issue of rehabilitation for drug addicts, the 
minister spelled out measures currently used by the government 
to set up a rehabilitation service at the ward and commune level 
with wide cooperation from local authorities, mass 
organizations, and families of drug addicts. Drug addicts who 
use intravenous drugs should be sent to institutionalized 
centers; however, the most important task is always the active 
prevention of this social vice. 
  Construction Minister Ngo Xuan Loc answered questions on the 
price of houses in Ho Chi Minh City, and revealed that in the 
recent past his ministry has quickly rectified errors previously 
committed when carrying out the task of appraising house prices . 
  Trade Minister Le Van Triet answered questions on cases 
concerning paper imports, import quotas for motorcycles, and one 
case concerning 38 motorcars imported into Binh Dinh Province. 
The minister held that the Trade Ministry was basing its work 
on the amount of paper produced domestically to allow the import 
of a necessary amount of paper -- types of paper that cannot be 
produced here -- for use in the sector concerning external 
relations. The decision to withhold motorcycle import permits 
is in line with the government policy to use foreign currency 
reserves to import production supply.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Hoang Duc Dam: "Military Region 9 </F>
Strengthens Military Training To Keep Up With Combat Readiness 
Needs, Task"] 
  [Text] In recent years, the situation on the borders, along 
the coast, at sea, and on the islands of Military Region 9 was 
quite complicated. According to incomplete data, from January to 
September 1993, foreign aircraft violated our air space over the 
borders 31 times; people crossed the borders to flee the country 
1,200 times; and people illegally entered the country more than 
200 times. Twenty armed robberies and 17 cases of property 
stealing took place; and people smuggled goods across the 
borders on average about 1,000 times a day. Considerable 
losses of lives and properties were inflicted on the people 
living along the borders. 
  At sea, since the beginning of this year, aircraft violated 
our air space in pursuit of our fishing boats 8 times; warships 
of the Thai Navy violated our territorial sea 26 times as they 
openly chased after, searched, and seized 6 of our boats; 
confiscated fishing equipment and properties from 9 other boats; 
and captured 54 fishermen. Thai fishing boats violated our 
territorial sea to illegally catch fish in average 30-40 times 
per boat per day. Cambodian fishing patrol boats also violated 
our waters 78 times to round up and fine the boats of our 
fishermen. Piracy frequently took place in the area of the 
"Pirates" islands; 15 cases involving losses of lives and 
properties destroyed the peace of mind of our fishermen. 
  Inside the region, the reactionaries who took advantage of 
ethnic and religious issues and the criminals who had refused to 
be reeducated caused disturbances and disorder. 
  In the face of the above-mentioned situation, the issue that 
the armed forces of the military region had to face was to make 
sure that building and training satisfy the needs of the combat 
readiness task, both immediate and in the long term, and 
contribute to safeguarding national sovereignty and maintaining 
political security, order, and social safety in the military 
region. 
  We carried out the directive on military training and 
political education in 1993 issued by the commander of the 
military region: "In 1993, we must continue to guide training 
toward being basic, realistic, steady, and suitable for the 
needs and task of individual forces and units, and suitable for 
the characteristic terrain of the military region, the 
existing table of organization and equipment of individual 
units, the combat objectives that have been set, and the 
fighting realities and traditional fighting patterns of Vietnam 
and of the military region's armed forces, thus making sure to 
provide our forces with three arms, to properly fulfill the 
assigned tasks, and to defeat the enemy under any circumstances." 
  Right from the beginning of the year, before starting the 
main-session training, in addition to teaching and understanding 
the task, plan for, and principle of training and organizing 
advanced training for cadres according to their ranks, the 
military region had been holding seminars to have in-depth 
discussions about renovating the contents and methods of 
training for larger units (main-force divisions, brigades, and 
regiments, and local battalions). On the basis of the technical 
and tactical documents issued by the General Staff, seminar 
participants discussed applying the training of troops to delta 
and river-waterway terrains for the purpose of compiling 
appropriate and realistic training curricula. 
  In the seminars, the issue that received a high degree of 
unanimity was the need to strengthen open-air training, with the 
amount of the latter accounting for 40 percent or more of the 
total training in each unit and for each individual. Depending 
on the task of a unit, the latter would choose an appropriate 
location for open-air training, normally a border area or a key 
point (central points, ethnic minority zones, religious areas, 
remote areas, and so on), with companies or battalions being 
rotated to take part in open-air operations. Open-air training 
should be aimed at satisfying these needs: to get used to the 
terrain, to train in adaptability and tenacity, to train in the 
concept of organizing regular-army discipline and order, to 
apply training to troops-management regulations, and to train in 
technical and tactical matters under the conditions of being 
stationed in river-waterway terrain and densely-populated areas. 
Mass proselyting should be combined with training to contribute 
to building the political base and to urge the youth to enroll 
in the army and to actively take part in providing the locality 
and people, particularly the families having few members, with 
labor. The time spent for open-air activities was 10 days or 
more, up to 1-2 months in the case of some units (depending on 
the training subjects and the political situation in the 
locality demanding a longer period of such training). 
  Almost all permanent forces in the military region 
(including 
the main force, local troops, armed services, and organs) have 
so far obtained good results from their work: Regiment H/Corps B 
went to the Tan Hiep religious zone (Kien Giang Province); 
Regiment M/Corps B30 to the remote U Minh area (Minh Hai 
Province); Regiment B/Corps B30, Artillery Brigade S, and 
Battalion N12/An Giang to the Hoa Hao Zone (An Giang Province); 
and Regiment C/Corps B29 to the border area of Dong Thap. The 
Phu Loi/Soc Trang Battalion, in 6 training operations, went 
through 24 villages in the region of Khmer population and the 
former resistance base area consisting of 4 of the province's 
districts --Vinh Long, Long My, My Xuyen, and Ke Sach. The 
Truong Dinh/Tien Giang Battalion and Battalion N87/Vinh Long 
went to as far as Dong Thap and An Giang border areas in the 
training operations that were coordinated with the local 
district companies and village militia forces in their 
exercises, in accordance with common defense plans. The 
military region's reconnaissance battalion also launched in the 
An Giang border area a training operation that was aimed at both 
improving its professional capabilities and fulfilling the task 
of ensuring combat readiness through coordination. 
  As for the militia and self-defense forces, in the past 
years, training was mainly based on the infantry training 
materials and curricula compiled by the Department of Militia 
and Self-Defense Forces. Using the terrain and traditional 
fighting methods adhered by the Mekong delta militia and 
self-defense forces, the military region recently gathered 
cadres of the local military schools to assign them the task of 
compiling specific training materials for the use of the militia 
and self-defense forces in the military region. These 
materials have been approved by the military region's 
Science-Industry Council and are being used to train local 
military cadres. These materials consist of three groups of 
lessons: political education (three lessons); self-made weapons, 
techniques, tactics for from individuals to platoons; and work 
to ensure rear-area activities in combat. Through their 
learning and discussions in training courses, most cadres found 
that the materials would respond better to terrain conditions 
and to the tasks and capabilities of the militia and 
self-defense forces and the locality. The militia and 
self-defense forces have so far obtained good results from 
training and from taking part in A2 exercises, which involved 
the troops' actual presence and the various assumed 
circumstances. As of September 1993, 851 villages and 1,125 
subwards already completed their exercises and made 
contributions to realistically improving their capabilities and 
usefulness in maintaining security, social order, and safety. 
The most outstanding event in May 1993 was the fact that Can Tho 
Province organized a combined force having as its backbone the 
militia and self-defense mobile forces of six districts, Can Tho 
City, and suburban villages; being 1,363-member strong (over 800 
members of the militia and self-defense forces; 90 members of 
the forces belonging to the provincial and district committees 
and sectors; 50 public security officers; and more than 400 
members of the provincial permanent force); and being sent in an 
operation to the O Mon-Thot Not region (around the Song Hau 
State Farm) to do combined open-air training and to carry out 
exercises aimed at defending villages and subwards. After that 
training phase, a program of training more recently was 
completed by the militia and self-defense forces in which they 
learned military technical and tactical matters to understand 
the terrain concerned so as to be ready to become mobile if 
necessary and at the same time to do mass proselyting work, to 
build the bases, to deter the bad elements, and to stabilize the 
situation in their area following the disturbances and 
demonstrations in Song Hau State Farm. This was an open-air 
training operation that brought about good results and offered 
the localities realistic usefulness in terms of maintaining 
political security and social order and safety. The local 
military organ was able to do this job because first of all it 
had properly fulfilled the staff's role in favor of the party 
committee echelons and administrations while trying to win the 
agreement and support of the latter and mass organizations; at 
the same time, it had cleverly combined the national defense 
expenditures and local budget, and the people's assistance as 
well, in order to ensure the rear-area activities in favor of 
the forces taking part in the open-air operation. 
  At sea, the military region paid attention to assuming 
leadership and training the sea self-defense forces for the 
purpose of properly combining the tasks of producing, catching, 
and marketing sea products with those of safeguarding the 
sovereignty and security in the waters of the military region. 
As to its forces, the military region has so far established 4 
naval groups, 20 flotillas, and 19 detachments, with a total of 
over 1,200 fishing boats being fully equipped with 
self-defense weapons and the necessary means of 
communications. The sea self-defense forces were trained in 
the Law of the Sea, how to identify foreign boats and ships, 
methods of coordinated communications aimed at chasing after and 
driving away foreign boats and ships during their violating 
Vietnam's waters, tactics used to chase after unidentified 
ships, techniques used to fire at targets at sea, and so on. The 
main units were the individual boats, which fully used the time 
they were anchored in port and the time they traveled back and 
forth for training. The military region also distributed work 
to naval groups and flotillas and regularly kept plans for sea 
activities for them to carry out in close coordination with 
border defense troops and the antiaircraft, air force, and naval 
forces stationed in the military region. As a result, both 
economic and national defense tasks were carried out quite 
successfully, with very obvious results being obtained. In the 
first 9 months of 1993, the sea self-defense forces caught 43 
foreign fishing boats as they illegally operated in our fishing 
grounds and drove away many unidentified boats as they violated 
our southwestern waters. Our catch was also considerably high: 
The Kien Giang naval group alone, in the first 9 months of 
1993, caught 11,000 tons of fish and shrimps, valued at a total 
of 32 billion dong, or 75 percent of the annual goal, with 27 
billion dong being put into the budget. 
  As the result of the above-mentioned activities, the 
military 
region helped to limit and considerably reduce the number of 
foreign boats that violated our waters to catch fish, as well as 
the acts of armed provocation of warships, pirates, smugglers, 
and so on. It also contributed to strengthening the confidence 
of the sea self-defense forces and fishermen, expanding the 
fishing grounds and increasing the catch, and supporting the 
exploration and extraction of gas, oil, and other resources in 
the southwestern sea within the jurisdiction of Military Region 
9. 
  In 1993, Military Region 9 showed an initial change in 
military training and political education along the line of the 
needs of its combat task, along with production, and in 
conformity with the terrain, equipment, and traditional fighting 
methods in favor of both the regular forces and the militia and 
self-defense forces. It is continuing to learn from experience 
in order to assume leadership and to multiply the typical acts, 
all for the purpose of carrying out even better the "Basic, 
realistic, and steady training" motto that the ministry has set 
forth.

<F P=106> [Comment at seminar on socioeconomic issues by Nguyen Dinh </F>
So, member, CPV Central Committee, and secretary, Ha Tay 
Provincial CPV Committee: "Exchanging of Experiences--Leading 
the National Defense Work in Ha Tay"] 
  [Text] Our party has affirmed that building and defending 
the fatherland always is the two closely-linked strategic tasks 
and the law of Vietnam's revolution. 
  Today, in the renovating efforts, as the task of 
socioeconomic stabilization and development is placed at the top 
of our agenda, the task of firmly defending the independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the socialist 
fatherland, and stopping and defeating every enemy destructive 
and aggressive plot and act remains the strategic task of all 
our people, army, and political system. 
  Maintaining peace and political stability has a decisive 
significance for the fate of the nation and the development of 
the country. On the other hand, socioeconomic development and 
improvement of the standard of living are the topmost conditions 
for strengthening our ability to defend the fatherland. 
  In the face of complex international and regional changes, 
the fact that the country is encountering new challenges and new 
opportunities requires that we thoroughly understand the party's 
views and line and apply them to our locality in an appropriate 
manner. The Ha Tay Provincial CPV Committee always adheres to 
this leadership thinking and carries out the task of leading the 
efforts to consolidate national defense in the locality. These 
are the major issues that Ha Tay Province always attaches 
importance to and concentrates its leadership and guidance on: 
  I - To try to stabilize production and the living 
standard, to create the people's political and spiritual 
unity as the invincible line of defense in defending the 
fatherland. 
  In the economic field, the characteristics of the province 
-- 
nearly 80 percent of the population lives on farming in rural 
areas -- requires that we concentrate our efforts on achieving 
total development of agricultural production, with the central 
point of interest being grain production. In 1993, our 
production was 810,000 tons, exceeding the goal (800,000 tons) 
set for 1995. The per capita average production increased from 
317 kilograms/year (in 1990) to 365 kilograms/year (in 1993). 
Our province granted the people the right to have long-term 
steady use of land as early as mid-1992. Although land was a 
pretty complicated issue due to many years of war and numerous 
changes in the sizes of cooperatives and in land and rural 
population, the fact that we assumed tight leadership over the 
efforts to grant farmers the land right ensured maintaining of 
stability and avoiding of disturbances and troubles. The 
people who lived in rural areas and did not have any other 
occupations, including active military personnel and workers and 
civil servants transferred to the locality, all received land. 
That was an important factor that enabled farmers to have 
peace of mind and the enthusiasm for doing productive work. 
  In addition to agricultural production, the people of Ha Tay 
have many handicraft occupations. In 1990 and 1991, because of 
many difficulties, our production declined. Recently, the 
province has strengthened its leadership; consolidated, 
developed, and promoted all economic sectors; stepped up 
industrial, small industrial, and handicraft production; and 
succeeded in boosting the latter to account for more than 30 
percent of the total value of agricultural and industrial 
output, thus creating more jobs, raising the people's income, 
and gradually increasing accumulation of wealth. 
  In the social field, in addition to correctly implementing 
the social policies, we pay attention to gradually building the 
new countryside: achieving "happy villages, harmonious 
families." We do realistic work depending on the abilities of 
individual villages and aimed at three goals: raising the 
people's intellectual standard, strengthening community welfare, 
and protecting national culture and the environment. 
  The province has so far remodeled 60 percent of its schools 
to make them more good-looking; 100 percent of villages now have 
their own dispensaries; more than half of village roads have a 
brick or concrete surface; nearly 100 percent of villages have 
provided homes with electricity and have installed wired radio 
loudspeakers in their hamlets; some villages are creating their 
own new cultural models, and so on. These are the realistic 
measures aimed at creating the people's confidence in the 
party's new positions and policies, and stopping and defeating 
the enemy's "peaceful development." 
  In addition to caring about production and the standard of 
living, we expand democratic activities among the people. We 
have succeeded in urging wide and democratic participation of 
the people in the periods of soliciting public opinion for 
contributions to party congress documents, the Constitution, 
state laws, National Assembly elections, and so on; we have 
clarified, resolved, and dealt with in a timely manner the 
people's petitions and issues of concern raised by the public. 
As for the complicated cases, the "hot spots," the province 
has provided all sectors and echelons with guidance in regard to 
how to correctly evaluate the reasons behind any problems, 
particularly behind any contradictions among the people, so as 
to correctly handle them in accordance with the following 
principle: As to all matters having to do with the people, they 
must persistently rely on the people to resolve them at the 
basic level, with cadres having to apologize to the people and 
to behave accordingly after committing some mistakes. The key 
leading cadres need to hold direct conversations with the people. 
  As a result, the "hot spots" were all safely resolved, thus 
preventing the bad people from taking advantage of them and 
avoiding quarrels among the people and a loss of their 
solidarity. The fact that the rural areas became more stable 
and the standard of living was improved has been a positive 
contribution to the common stability in the province as a whole. 
  II - To build defense areas, to strengthen the 
all-people national defense potential and combat posture. 
  1. The first job is to educate and mobilize all the 
people and the entire political system for having the necessary 
concept and knowledge regarding today's task of consolidating 
national defense and maintaining security. 
  In various forms and with appropriate measures, Ha Tay has 
gradually made its cadres, party members, and people clearly see 
the enemy's wicked plots and tricks and at the same time grasp 
the characteristics and new needs of the current task of 
defending the fatherland. On this basis, it has been trying to 
heighten vigilance and the spirit of responsibility and to build 
a strong base so as to turn every village into a "fortress" and 
every citizen into a warrior devoted to the defense of our 
native land and the defense of the fatherland. It has plans 
for closely linking national defense and security with the 
political system to create a combined force and to be ready to 
successfully deal with any peaceful-development tricks, 
subversive and overthrowing action, or any daring acts on the 
part of the enemy. 
  2. To do good planning for economic development through 
the year 2000, to closely link economic development plans with 
consolidation of national defense. 
  We all know that the economy and national defense have close 
relationships and act on each other. How do we build the 
economy in order to both strengthen the national defense 
potential and create favorable conditions for national defense? 
In our economy today, the state is the social operator and 
manager and at the same time the major customer of economic 
units. It uses the law to operate; policies and other tools to 
act; and inevitably development plans to limit the negative 
aspects, to make the people rich and the country strong, and to 
hold steady the socialist movement. To achieve this, it 
requires that the planning for economic development, now and in 
the long term, be closely linked with national defense, with the 
two strategic tasks being truly combined. This is an extremely 
important issue in the planning and plans for socioeconomic 
development. As to Ha Tay, a large province having over 2.2 
million people, specific resources, and many good historical 
monuments and natural sights, and being adjacent to the capital 
city of Hanoi, it has planned and will plan for becoming a 
province having an economic structure suitable for its 
capabilities and conditions (concentrating on three main 
sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, and tourism) and at the 
same time being capable of maintaining national security and 
creating favorable conditions for further strengthening 
national defense. We have been paying attention to making 
economic installations thoroughly understand the party views and 
avoid being interested "solely in economic matters," going after 
income at any cost, pursuing joint business and alliance in an 
unprincipled manner, and thus weakening national defense and the 
security of the locality and the country. 
  3. To build our armed forces strong in every way. 
  In the last few years, as we contributed to building a 
well-trained regular revolutionary army being gradually 
modernized, we set quality as the first requirement in our 
recruiting and calling up people and at the same time made sure 
that we fulfill the goals that the state had assigned to us. 
In the years of 1992 and 1993, nearly 80 percent of our 
recruits were in the good-health category; 94.3 percent of them 
had cultural background of levels 2 and 3. In addition, we also 
overfulfilled the goals set for recruiting people for military 
schools. The numbers of people having passed the examinations 
in Ha Tay accounted for 10 percent of the national total in 1992 
and 11.3 percent in 1993. 
  To build the reserve force ready for mobilization was 
considered a regular and long lasting important task. This was 
a rather demanding job because it had to do with 25,000 people 
in almost all villages and production installations; it required 
a close combination; reasonably tight, neat, and professionally 
correct arrangement; and good quantity and quality in regard to 
both soldiers and cadres. Each year about 3,000 reserve officers 
and soldiers were involved in periodical training and exercises. 
Consequently, the party organizations and administrations at 
all levels had to adhere to tight leadership and management, to 
follow appropriate procedures and policies, and particularly to 
do a good job in regard to providing the people and members of 
the reserve force with good political and ideological education. 
  The militia and self-defense forces were further 
strengthened, with quality being the main goal to be achieved; 
they were organized in such a way as to be closely linked with 
administrative headquarters and production units (hamlets, 
villages, organs, enterprises) and to be of the right size 
(about 1.5 percent of the population). Training had to be 
realistic. The activities of these forces had to be linked 
with protecting production and maintaining security and order at 
the basic level; fees had to be paid by the collectives and 
people to allow them to operate effectively and to strengthen 
their organization on a regular basis. 
  4. To correctly implement the army's rear-area 
policy. 
  Because this was a job that would directly affect the 
building of the armed forces, party organizations, 
administrations, and mass organizations at all levels, from 
provincial to basic, attached a proper importance to it. The 
province as a whole had more than 37,000 dead heroes and nearly 
25,000 wounded soldiers. As the right to use land on a steady 
and long-term basis was granted farmers, close-by and good 
ricefields were given on a first-priority basis to families of 
dead heroes and wounded soldiers, who were exempted from paying 
any contributions. On the 45th anniversary of the 27-7 event 
(in 1992), people in the province contributed money and energy 
to repairing and building hundreds of cemeteries and a number of 
monuments, built 500 affection-and-devotion houses and awarded 
more than 10,000 savings books to the families of dead heroes 
and wounded soldiers who had encountered difficulties, and took 
100 percent of the seriously wounded soldiers (more than 500 of 
them) into their homes and provided for them. 
  Although there still were shortcomings, the above-mentioned 
deeds reflected a good effort and a total moral affectionate 
behavior toward those people who had sacrificed their lives for 
the independence and freedom of the fatherland and the happiness 
of the people; they have brought a degree of peace of mind to 
the people who are and will be fulfilling the military 
obligation and to their relatives. 
  5. To closely coordinate the work between the locality 
and the main-force units stationed in the province so as to 
maintain security and to strengthen solidarity between the army 
and the people. 
  At present, there are in Ha Tay Province many units of the 
main-force corps [binh doan], arms and services, institutes, 
officers' schools, storehouses, and national defense 
enterprises. Both the locality and the army are paying proper 
attention to the close coordination among them. 
  Party committee echelons at all levels, from provincial to 
district, city, and village, have plans for coordinating their 
work with these units in order to maintain security under any 
circumstances. Local party committee echelons and 
administrations, along with the heads of these units, hold 
annual meetings to exchange ideas about realistic work aimed at 
strengthening solidarity between the people and the army in the 
new situation. Many units have wholeheartedly helped the 
people to fight natural disasters, to protect production, to 
build schools and affection-and-devotion houses, to get medical 
treatment, and so on. On the other hand, many localities have 
helped the army units to protect their barracks, storehouses, 
and lines of communications, and to uncover and handle in a 
timely manner any misuses of army properties. 
  For the time being, the localities and units are checking 
the 
areas and boundaries of land so as to report them to the 
government, which will legitimize the right of the army to use 
land and at the same time will put aside some land where it is 
available for the construction of military families' residential 
areas, and thus to create favorable conditions for gradually 
stabilizing the family life of cadres of those units being 
assigned for long-term stationing in the province. 
  Because national defense work is very important and has to 
do with many aspects and many fields of activities, we must 
ensure the party's absolute and total leadership, first of all 
in regard to national defense views, line, and policies. 
  As we assume the national defense leadership in the 
locality, 
we pay attention to taking the following key steps: 
  - To correctly apply the party's renovation views on the 
construction and defense of the fatherland so as to devise the 
ways to strengthen national defense in the locality. 
  - To build the armed forces to make them truly clean and 
strong, suitable for peacetime military organization, and ready 
to satisfy wartime needs. 
  - To make plans for and train military cadres to make them 
loyal and reliable people having strong determination, good 
background, and the necessary knowledge of economic and 
foreign-policy affairs. 
  - Through party building, to strengthen and fully control 
party bases. To consider building party bases the important 
part of the efforts to build and strengthen national defense and 
security in the locality. 
  The state relies on the party line and policies, which are 
formalized in the form of documents serving as laws and 
regulations to be abided by all people, including party members, 
as they fulfill their sacred obligation toward the defense of 
the fatherland. The state must also take care of more 
important practical matters, such as balancing the budget, and 
the procedures and policies having to do with national defense 
and create favorable conditions for the locality to be stronger 
and stronger in terms of doing its national defense work.

<F P=106> [Article by Nhi Le: "The Problem and Reality of `Hot Spots' </F>
in Thanh Hoa"] 
  [Text] The concept of "hot spots" has appeared here in 
recent years. But what are "hot spots?" Looking at many 
different events in many places, many people think that a "hot 
spot" is a place where a major or even fierce struggle is going 
on among the people over some issue in a particular sphere (from 
a hamlet or village on up). The matter cannot be resolved on the 
spot and requires intervention on the part of the party 
committee echelons, the authorities, and judicial organizations 
from the primary level on up. 
  Thanh Hoa is one province where a rather large number of 
"hot 
spots" have appeared since the end of 1988. The first was the 
land dispute that arose between the Thanh Son Cooperative and 
the Sao Vang State Farm (subordinate to Xuan Son Village in Tho 
Xuan District) on 22 November 1988. Other disputes arose at the 
end of 1989. Most of the "hot spots" are in rural areas, and 
they are concentrated in places where the population density is 
high and where order and security have always been a problem. 
The "hot spots" are mainly at the level of the hamlet and 
village, with a few at the city level. From 22 November 1988 to 
30 December 1992, there have been eight hot spots in Hau Loc 
District, six in Tho Xuan District, six in Cam Thuy District, 
five in Ngoc Lac District, five in Trieu Son District, nine in 
Thanh Hoa City, and two each in the cities of Bim Son and Sam 
Son. The thing to note is that "hot spots" have a tendency to 
"expand" rather rapidly, and they are concentrated in a short 
time period. For example, in 1992 alone, there were five hot 
spots in Ngoc Lac, four in Trieu Son, six in Hau Loc, and three 
in Thieu Yen. By 12 November 1993, a total of 120 "hot spots" 
had appeared in Thanh Hoa. Analyzing those 120 hot spots shows 
the following: 
  Scale: Sixty-five percent of the disputes were confined to a 
single village, almost 18 percent of the disputes were confined 
to villages within a single district, more than 5 percent 
involved villages in different districts, and other types 
accounted for more than 7 percent. 
  Form: Fifty-four percent of the disputes concerned arable 
land, 19 percent had to do with a loss of solidarity between the 
people and the cadres at the primary level, 19.5 percent 
concerned loss of solidarity among the people, and 7.5 percent 
were disputes within state organizations. 
  Nature: Conflicts concerning land (which accounted for most 
of the disputes), conflicts between the people and civil service 
organizations, conflicts involving a struggle for power and 
material rights, and conflicts that broke out suddenly. 
  Degree: Eleven percent of the conflicts have been very 
fierce, 49 percent have been tense, and 40 percent have been 
"smoldering." 
<H5>  The Reasons for the "Hot Spots" </H5>
  There are three main reasons: 
  1. There are hot spots that have arisen because some of the 
leading and managerial cadres at the primary level are corrupt 
and have violated the ownership rights of the people. The 
majority of the party members and people detest these people and 
have denounced them and filed complaints against them, but their 
violations have not been investigated or dealt with promptly and 
resolutely, with the result that the masses do not understand 
things and lack confidence. In some places, the masses suspect 
that the district is covering up the mistakes of the 
primary-level cadres, which has made the situation even more 
complex and tense. 
  Making use of this situation, a number of evil elements, 
including dissatisfied and opportunistic cadres and party 
members have incited a number of people whose vigilance is poor 
to go to extremes in waging struggles, which has led to people 
violating the principles of the party and the laws of the state. 
Widely used forms include organizing suits in many places, 
making excessive demands, insulting the cadres and party members 
who have made mistakes based on "self-judgment," and taking 
people hostage. This has led to conflicts between a number of 
people and the primary- and district-level leadership 
organizations and the internal affairs, public security, 
control, and inspection sectors. 
  Looking at the "hot spots" of Nam Giang in Tho Xuan 
District, 
Tho Ngoc in Trieu Son District, Tien Loc in Hau Loc District, 
and Quang Loc in Quang Xuong District, it can be seen that they 
arose for the reasons mentioned above and exhibit the above 
manifestations. These are complex "hot spots" that all have 
"leaders" and "instigators." The "leader" may be a single 
individual or a group of people. These people have organized 
themselves, there are "leaders," there is a division of labor, 
and they have established illegal organizations using the words 
"open and democratic," "anti-corruption front," and 
"anti-negative association" in order to trick party members and 
the masses into following them. On the other hand, they also use 
people with police records and hoodlums to put pressure on the 
authorities and internal affairs sectors, terrorize and threaten 
those who are waging an honest struggle, spread false 
information, look for ways to neutralize the party and 
administrative apparatus, and force the districts and provinces 
to do what they want. 
  2. There are hot spots that have arisen because of disputes 
about administrative boundaries, land, markets, and so on 
between different hamlets and villages and, in some cases 
between two villages in different districts. Those disputes that 
have not been resolved promptly by the echelons and sectors with 
jurisdiction have resulted in spontaneous clashes between large 
numbers of people. At the same time, the authorities and bases 
have been put in a passive position and have not been able to 
control the situation. Or because they are biased, they have 
"followed" the masses. There have even been cases in which the 
militia and self-defense forces have been mobilized to attack 
people, which has had serious consequences and had a bad effect 
on hamlet and village order and security and internal security 
among the people. The problems between Quang Phuc and Quang Vong 
in Quang Xuong District, between Dong Quang and Dong Van in Dong 
Son District, between Quy Loc and Yen Tho in Thieu Yen District, 
and between Vinh Quang in Vinh Loc District and Cam Van in Cam 
Thuy District are all of this type. This type of "hot spot" 
usually arises in a relatively short period of time, but the 
consequences are immeasurable and this has caused many 
difficulties and problems in handling things using 
administrative and judicial measures. Furthermore, there are 
usually a large number of people participating at these "hot 
spots" and so it is difficult to determine the causes. Because 
of this, it is easy to forget about taking legal action against 
the criminals. As of 17 June 1992, Thanh Hoa had four such "hot 
spots." Even though the situation had been stabilized, the 
criminals had not been prosecuted. 
  3. Finally, there are hot spots that have arisen 
spontaneously for a variety of reasons. For example, some people 
have blocked and opposed those who are carrying out their public 
functions, and evil elements have "made a mountain out of a 
molehill" of this. This type of "hot spot" usually arises in 
places where order and security is a problem. At the same time, 
the local authorities and internal affairs organizations are 
weak and unable to handle specific situations, with the result 
that "hot spots" can arise and expand. Studying the hot spots: 
there was a fight between members of Unit 3 and Unit 9 in Tan 
Tuong Village, Tinh Gia District; there was a clash between 
Thanh Hoa City public security forces and the railroad station 
defense forces; there were two disturbances at the provincial 
people's court; and there was the case of people falsely 
accusing public security forces of beating someone to death and 
then stealing a public security vehicle and taking the body to 
the provincial CPV organization to jeer and incite people. All 
of these have a similar form. 
<H5>  Handling the "Hot Spots"--Initial lessons </H5>
  Looking at the 120 hot spots in the past 5 years, as of 12 
November 1993, Thanh Hoa had basically resolved more than 97 
percent of the cases. Of these, almost 24 percent of the cases 
had been fully resolved, and almost 40 percent of the hot spots 
had been basically stabilized. The remaining cases are in the 
process of being concluded. To gain experience and preliminarily 
summarize the process of handling the hot spots, Thanh Hoa will 
organize a special symposium. But based on the successes and 
failures in dealing with a number of broad, complex, and serious 
hot spots, we can learn a number of lessons: 
  1. Discovering things early, finding the real reasons, and 
advancing ideological work: 
  The successes in handling the hot spots in Thanh Hoa show 
that there must be an attitude of fairness. Also, the situation 
must be evaluated carefully and objectively, and the true causes 
and nature of the matter must be found in order to have suitable 
means to deal with the matter. Whenever there are signs that a 
"hot spot" is arising or that a new hot spot has recently 
arisen, the organizations responsible must find out what the 
real reasons are and analyze the nature of the conflict. At the 
same time, they must organize work teams consisting of capable 
cadres who have great prestige, who are experienced in party 
work and mass mobilization, and who are skilled in dealing with 
various situations and skillfully insert them into the "hot 
spots." Through the highly trusted people on the spot, they must 
clarify the problems and, together with the people, discuss and 
resolve the issues and problems on the spot, including those of 
relatives of the targets, in order to "gradually reduce the 
temperature," "ease the situation," and "defuse the situation." 
In particular, in places where the masses can easily be incited 
and already have problems with the leaders, ideological work 
must be carried on resolutely and skillfully in order to create 
good public opinion. The more good pressure is applied by the 
people, the better the results will be. The hot spots in Vinh 
Ninh in Vinh Loc District, Tan Lap in Ba Thuoc District, and 
Dong Hung in Thanh Hoa City were dealt with mainly in this way. 
And based on this method, almost 25 percent of the hot spots in 
Thanh Hoa have been basically "defused." 
  2. Using economic measures in conjunction with improving the 
apparatus and cadre work: 
  Handling the "hot spots" will take time. This cannot be 
rushed. Things cannot be done in a subjective manner, and stages 
cannot be skipped. At the same time, things cannot be delayed, 
which would allow the situation to dray on. Reality shows that 
if such situations are allowed to drag on, efforts to resolve 
matters will encounter many complex difficulties. Thus, there 
are things that must be carried on tensely, especially tasks 
related to stabilizing life at the primary level, particularly 
economic life. For example, the "hot spots" that have 
difficulties concerning work formulas can be guided and given 
help in building a number of infrastructural and public welfare 
projects in order to involve the people in production and reduce 
their concerns. 
  On the other hand, tasks related to organizing and 
solidifying the apparatus and strengthening the cadres must be 
handled promptly, and those who have committed violations, 
particularly cadres and party members who have clearly committed 
violations and who no longer have the confidence of the people, 
must be dealt with, which includes taking legal action against 
them, recovering things and paying material damages (if any), 
and doing things openly before the people. 
  The experiences in handling the hot spots in Tho Ngoc in 
Trieu Son District, Nam Giang in Tho Xuan District, Quang Loc in 
Quang Xuong District, Nga Thach in Nga Son District, and a 
number of other complex spots in Tho Xuan and Cam Thuy show that 
this is a very important measure that is in accord with the 
legitimate demands of the cadres, party members, and masses and 
that manifests the strictness of the law. If these problems are 
solved well, there will no longer be any reasons that 
dissatisfied and extremist elements can use to complicate the 
situation. 
  3. Dealing with things promptly and resolutely from within: 
  Taking resolute action against cadres and party members who 
participate in the "hot spots" is both urgent and necessary in 
order to "set an example" for the people. This is very important 
for blocking and handling the "hot spots." The experiences in 
dealing with typical hot spots such as Tho Ngoc, Quang Loc, Nam 
Giang, and Nga Thach show this very clearly. For example, in the 
Tho Ngoc case, one person was disciplined and expelled from the 
party, three were given warnings, and the chairman of the 
village people's committee, the head of the village public 
security force, and the secretary of the village CPV committee 
were dismissed from office. In particular, Le Hong Bao, the 
cooperative director, was tried and sentenced to 5 years in 
prison. As a result, the problems there were basically solved, 
the situation at Tho Ngoc stabilized, and the village has 
continued to advance. When handling the hot spots in Quang Loc, 
Nam Giang, and Nga Thach, 29 party members there were 
disciplined. Following this, other hot spots declined in 
intensity, and this created a good tendency for handling other 
spots on a provincial scale. 
  Something that should be noted is that with respect to the 
"leaders," in general, an open attitude and flexible measures 
for dealing with them are required. There must be a dialogue. 
People must listen to their ideas, analyze things, and persuade 
them. At the same time, we must adhere to the principles and 
resolutely criticize their extremist actions that violate the 
law. The die-hard instigators and leaders must be differentiated 
from those who have been misled or used, with appropriate 
methods used to deal with each type of target. 
  Along with dealing with things promptly and resolutely from 
within, troublemakers and hoodlums and those who "grope for fish 
in muddy waters" must be resolutely suppressed in accord with 
the law. The sympathy and support of the people must be 
obtained, and spontaneous actions that cause trouble must 
definitely be avoided. This is a very important guideline for 
handling things. The five prison sentences meted out to the 
above targets at four "hot spots" (with the stiffest sentence 
being 12 years in prison and the lightest being 2 years) clearly 
affirms that "being strict both within and among the masses" has 
a great effect in dealing with the hot spots. 
  4. The independence of the bases must be strengthened, but 
the close leadership and guidance of higher echelons must be 
maintained. 
  In order to deal with the hot spots, the party committee 
echelons and authorities, from the primary to the district 
level, must do things actively and speedily under the close 
leadership and guidance of the provincial CPV committee and 
provincial people's committee. In particular, there must be a 
high degree of unanimity from top to bottom in determining the 
reasons for the rise of "hot spots" and formulating solutions. 
Simple, subjective, and quick methods and a desire to deal with 
things immediately using rigid methods must be opposed. On the 
other hand, rightist thinking and not daring to deal with things 
must be opposed, and the concept of relying on others must be 
opposed: the primary level waiting on the district, the 
districts waiting on the province, and the functional sectors 
shifting responsibility to each other. The methods used to deal 
with the hot spots must be synchronized. Educating, 
propagandizing, and mobilizing the masses must go hand in hand 
with solidifying the party and administrative organizations and 
dealing with things using administrative and judicial measures. 
  As for the complex "hot spots," particularly the burning and 
very tense hot spots, work groups or teams headed by a key 
leader must be formed and sent to the hot spots. They must have 
full power to deal with the situation, and they will be 
responsible to higher echelons for their actions. What must be 
emphasized is that enforcing the laws at the hot spots must be 
based above all on having accurate and timely information, 
serving as the staff for the leaders, and dealing effectively 
with situations on the spot swiftly and safely. 
  As for hot spots in the hamlets, the villages must handle 
things on their own, with the district monitoring things and 
providing help. When the hot spots are in the villages, the 
district must personally handle things, with the province 
monitoring things and providing help. Based on their functions 
and tasks, the committees and sectors at the provincial level 
must help the districts. The province must not do things in 
place of the districts, but it must not be lax in providing 
leadership and guidance or slight its responsibilities. 
<H5>  Proposals Based on Realities </H5>
  From the realities in Thanh Hoa, in order to actively 
prevent 
hot spots from arising and to continue dealing effectively with 
those hot spots that have arisen with the aim of maintaining 
stability and promoting development from the primary level, I 
would like to propose the the following: 
  First, the central echelon should soon review the work of 
building and solidifying the bases and improving the quality of 
the ranks of cadres and party members. It should strengthen 
propaganda activities, give the cadres and people at the primary 
level an all-round education, particularly concerning legal 
matters, overcome the "illiteracy" concerning judicial 
knowledge, and standardize judicial knowledge for the key 
leaders and managers at the primary level. At the same time, the 
central echelon should soon review and learn the lessons in 
building models of organizations subordinate to the 
primary-level authorities (hamlet and village) and in regulating 
the activities of the hamlet and village heads so that these can 
be used on a nationwide scale. 
  Second, the central echelon should soon revise the laws and 
documents under the law to concretize dealing with the petitions 
and complaints of citizens. It must provide guidance in 
formulating concrete solutions based on the functions and powers 
of each echelon and sector with respect to the above tasks in 
order to ensure that the complaints of the people are dealt with 
effectively, promptly, and in accord with the law and in order 
to overcome the situation in which people simply try to shift 
the responsibility to someone else, which weakens the confidence 
of the masses. 
  Third, the central echelon should soon promulgate 
regulations 
in order to put an end to the confusion. These should deal with 
such things as, How should the internal affairs forces be used 
to deal with the hot spots? What should the contents of "martial 
law" orders be? And how should the mass means of information 
convey information to the hot spots in order to ensure accuracy 
and to prevent the enemy from making use of this and distorting 
the situation?

  [Text] Nusa Dua (Bali), Jun 13 (OANA-ANTARA) -- State 
Minister for the Mobilization of Investment Funds who is also 
chairman of the Coordinating Board for Investment (BKPM) Sanyoto 
Sastrowardoyo noted here on Monday the six ASEAN member 
countries will not compete each other in inviting foreign 
investors. 
  "On the contrary, they will even cooperate either in 
inviting 
foreign investors or investment among the ASEAN member 
countries," he told the press after inaugurating the ASEAN 
working group on the promotion of foreign direct investment here 
on Monday. 
  He expressed the hope that the meeting would yield a 
mechanism for foreign investment among the ASEAN member 
countries aside from the foreign investors. 
  "We need a certain promotion campaign among the ASEAN member 
countries in a bid to invite foreign investment since the 
competition is getting tougher," he said. 
  He reminded the ASEAN countries on the need for them to 
anticipate the development of the world economy which tends to 
the regional groups such as North America Free Trade Area 
(NAFTA), the Unification of the Europe, the Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). 
  "We should also anticipate the implementation of the General 
Agreement of Tariff and Trade (GATT) agreed last April," he said. 
  Queried about the ASEAN's view on the government regulation 
No. 20/1994 which provide greater access for foreign capital in 
company ownership, geographical spread and sectoral business 
lines, he said that ASEAN welcomed the economic deregulation 
package. 
  "The package can not be avoided, meaning that Indonesia 
should issue such a package, otherwise it will be left behind," 
he said. 
  Indonesia should increase its competitiveness in the current 
globalisation era if it wants to be survived, he said. 
  "The government regulation is one of our ways in 
consolidating with others to attract more foreign investors," he 
added. 
  Speaking on the future composition of foreign investment, he 
said that Japan stood at the first position followed by Taiwan 
replacing Hong Kong which has been in the second position since 
1967 to May 1994. 
  He attributed to the impressive performance of Taiwan to the 
country's aggressive efforts to improve investment in Indonesia 
by among others sending business leaders who accompanied their 
president during his visit here recently. 
  He also said that Taiwan's improved investment climate was 
also as a result of "go south action programme" which promoted 
investment to its neighboring countries in the south such as 
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. 
  Deputy Chairman for Foreign Investment Affairs at the BKPM 
Sugihono Kadarisman said that a number of developed countries 
still exerted non-economic pressures such as human rights issues 
and the most favoured nations (MFN). 
  Kadarisman said that the country will discuss a strategy to 
counter such pressures confronting Indonesia's serious efforts 
to promote foreign investment. 
  Some 50 participants from ASEAN member countries are 
attending the two-day meeting.

  [Text] Malaysia has reiterated the need for appropriate and 
acceptable mechanisms to relieve coastal states of the onerous 
responsibility and burden of keeping the Straits of Malacca safe. 
  Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said it is 
patently unfair to expect the littoral states to use national 
funds to underwrite what is, by and large, an international 
responsibility. He adds, however, that the littoral states, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand do not wish to 
adopt any unilateral decision regarding the management of the 
strait, one of the busiest waterways in the world. 
  He was delivering a keynote address at an international 
conference on the Straits of Malacca organized by the Malaysian 
Institute of Maritime Affairs in Kuala Lumpur. The two-day 
inaugural conference attended by about 180 participants will 
discuss matters pertaining to the (?risk) management, 
navigational, and environmental problems of the strait. 
  Datuk Abdullah said there was a need for cooperation to 
secure a safer navigation and a cleaner strait regime because 
many of the potential risks and problems associated with the 
strait were the results of externalities. The problems are 
created by ships in transit as well as multiple use of the 
waterway. He pointed out that the three states are facing the 
situation where the international shipping community use the 
strait on a free of charge basis while the littoral states have 
to bear the financial burden to keep the strait clean and safe.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 14 June on 
North Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 1 a 1,600-word 
report on the movement of the ROK Government, the United States, 
the IAEA, and China in the face of North Korea's withdrawal from 
the IAEA, writing they are all agonizing over mapping out 
countermeasures. The report notes that the North Korean nuclear 
issue is at the edge of a cliff, while noting that the ROK 
Government confirmed again its stance of pushing for UN 
imposition of sanctions against North Korea by convening an 
emergency meeting of the Unification-National Security 
Coordination Council on 14 June. The report continues: "Because 
North Korea has not withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, NPT, a mother law of the IAEA, it still has a legal duty 
to undergo inspections of its nuclear facilities. In case North 
Korea should reject the inspections and order inspectors to 
leave, a process for international inspection of North Korea's 
nuclear activities will completely disappear, thereby greatly 
shocking the international community. North Korea's nuclear 
issue will surely bring about long-term consequences, depending 
upon the international community's response." 
  The report quotes Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and 
minister of the National Unification Board, as saying after the 
14 June Unification-National Security Coordination Council 
meeting that North Korea's breaking away from all safety devices 
guaranteeing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is 
decisively running counter to the peaceful solution of the 
nuclear issue, while urging North Korea to cooperate to secure 
all safety measures as required by the NPT system. The report 
further quotes Minister Yi as stressing that there is no 
peculiar military activity on North Korea's part, while noting 
the government will continue to make solid and consistent 
efforts for the peaceful solution of the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,200-word article on 
the reaction of the ROK Government. The article quotes 
participants in the 14 June Unification-National Security 
Coordination Council meeting as analyzing that North Korea's 
withdrawal from the IAEA was carried out to emphasize its 
threats that if the IAEA imposes sanctions, it will withdraw 
from the NPT; and if the UN Security Council decides on 
sanctions, it will regard this as a declaration of war. 
Government officials concerned are quoted as saying that North 
Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA is a low-level measure--one 
step lower than withdrawal from the NPT--to secure as many 
bargaining chips as possible; not to abruptly escalate the 
intensity of confrontation; not to yield to the pressure of 
sanctions; and to hold in check sanctions by the UN Security 
Council. The article comments: Considering that North Korea's 
latest move is aimed at testing our government's will, the ROK 
Government has decided to react strongly. 
  The article reports that it will be easier for the ROK 
Government and the United States to persuade China and other 
neighboring nations to deal with North Korea's nuclear issue, 
predicting that China and Russia will be able to exercise 
stronger influence and North Korea's nuclear issue will be 
discussed at a forum other than the United Nations. The article 
concludes that the government is concentrating its efforts on 
mapping out security countermeasures against North Korea's 
possible provocations. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial 
on the dangerous nature of North Korea's withdrawal from the 
IAEA, noting that North Korea's diplomacy is moving toward an 
extremely dangerous all-or-nothing stage. The editorial 
comments that North Korea has two goals: One, North Korea will 
deal only with the United States to the exclusion of the IAEA; 
two, North Korea is trying to drive a wedge in the international 
community's discussion of the imposition of sanctions. The 
editorial concludes that North Korea is trying to achieve a 
dramatic effect with the approach of the upcoming visit by 
former U.S. President Carter and urges North Korea to understand 
that the United States is not so easy and that if its excessive 
strategy fails, there will be a larger danger. 
  The moderate, culturally oriented MUNHWA ILBO carries on 
page 
1 an article on ROK and U.S. reactions. The article predicts 
that as a result of the increasing mistrust of North Korea, 
discussion at the UN Security Council will proceed more quickly, 
while noting the ROK and the United States have reaffirmed their 
position to push for the UN Security Council's imposition of 
phased sanctions on North Korea. 
  MUNHWA ILBO also carries on page 1 an article on Pyongyang's 
ulterior motives. The article reports that Pyongyang is trying 
to realize direct negotiations with the United States, while 
noting that in the eyes of North Korea, the IAEA is nothing but 
an obstacle to its negotiations with the United States. The 
article continues that North Korea did not withdraw from the 
NPT, reporting this means that North Korea is not preparing for 
a face-to-face confrontation with the United States, but shows 
that it has not given up its nuclear diplomacy through 
negotiations.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers 
on 15 June regarding North Korea's withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "We Can No Longer Let North Korea Take the 
Initiative." The editorial stresses that North Korea is not a 
rational society and that it has been obstinate in its 
unreasonable demands for almost half a century. The editorial 
holds the South partially responsible for "spoiling" the North 
by accepting their unreasonable demands. 
  Analyzing the withdrawal from the IAEA as "a strategy to 
earn 
some more time to develop nuclear weapons and gain better 
conditions for negotiations," the editorial warns that it is not 
significant that North Korea is holding back its withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT, and the government 
should stop accepting unreasonable demands. 
  The editorial concludes that the government should review 
how 
the United States and Russia ended their nuclear competition 
after the cold war and should develop the most practical 
strategy to deter war. 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 4 a 1,200-word article by 
reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's stance regarding the 
withdrawal. The article reports that the government believes 
North Korea's withdrawal is a strong political and psychological 
attack aimed at restraining further resolutions and leaving the 
U.S.-North Korean talks as the only communications channel. 
  The article reports that the government plans "to include a 
measure in the UN Security Council's sanction resolution that 
could cause North Korea substantial damage," while continuing to 
persuade China to agree to the UN resolution. 
  The article continues that the government's policy is that 
there is no alternative to sanctions and that the existing 
strategy of inducing North Korea to reform and opening up may 
change to a strategy of isolating North Korea. 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,600-word article by the 
deputy editor-in-chief entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue and 
the Economy." Noting that the ROK people have finally become 
aware of the emergency situation and have begun to purchase 
emergency materials, the column reports that it is very 
fortunate, however, there are no signs of an economic crisis. 
The column says that "the ROK people have been well trained for 
emergencies for the past 40 years of confrontation between the 
North and the South" and even developed an economy amid such a 
tense situation. The column recalls that the ROK people were 
able to create a "compressed growth" in a short period with an 
aim to outdo the North during the Pak Chong-hui regime. The 
column stresses that the government should strengthen internal 
cohesion and concludes that the best way for the people to repel 
a North Korean threat is to concentrate on their daily life 
dauntlessly and not show signs of social chaos. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,100-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon on the ROK 
Government's reaction to North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. 
The article reports that the government does not view the 
withdrawal as a new trick, but a part of the existing card, 
however, the withdrawal can be interpreted as "North Korea's 
determination that a UN Security Council sanction resolution 
will be followed by North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT." The 
article reports that a government official analyzes that the 
withdrawal only makes China and Russia less inclined to oppose 
sanctions. 
  The article says that the government may expedite the 
adoption of a UN sanction resolution early next week if North 
Korea does not change its attitude after former U.S. President 
Carter's visit to the North. The article reports that the 
government is also considering economic consequences and doing 
its utmost to maintain stability through impeccable security 
measures against North Korea's armed provocation. The article 
concludes by quoting a government official: "Our side, as well 
as North Korea and the international community, are all in a 
tense confrontation fearing that one step back will make one 
lose the initiative forever." 
  The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN, specializing 
in economic topics, publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial 
entitled "Tension of the North Korean Nuclear Issue and 
Preparedness." The editorial analyzes that North Korea withdrew 
from the IAEA merely to avoid losing face caused by the IAEA 
resolution and urges readers not to be affected by North Korea's 
nuclear game. The editorial stresses that the ROK people should 
not respond to North Korea's threats, such as their remarks 
about regarding sanctions as a declaration of war, and maintain 
economic activities unswervingly. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
1,000-word article by Yi Sung-chul on the government's reaction 
to North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from the IAEA. 
The article reports the government "will continuously push 
ahead with its original policy for sanctions against North Korea 
by the UN Security Council" because it believes North Korea's 
declaration on withdrawal from the IAEA "does not have any 
practical meaning, but has political and symbolic meaning." The 
article continues: "The government believes the nuclear issue 
has not changed at all in essence since North Korea is still 
obligated to accept inspections as a signatory of the NPT 
despite its declaration of withdrawal from the IAEA." 
  The article quotes a ranking government official as saying 
that the declaration by North Korea is "at an expected level 
[yejongdoen sujun] following the adoption of the UN Security 
Council resolution" and is regarded as "a bluff to counter the 
UN Security Council's moves toward sanctions" rather than "a new 
card." 
  The article also reports that the government's adherence to 
its original position on sanctions shows its will to take the 
lead in South-North relations in the adverse situation following 
North Korea's replacement of fuel rods. 
  Quoting a government official's remarks, the article notes: 
"The declaration by North Korea gave us an advantage in 
persuading countries like China, which have declined to agree to 
sanctions against North Korea." 
  The article reports that the government considers adding 
"stronger terms" [kanggyong naeyong] in the UN Security Council 
draft resolution in response to North Korea's follow-up measure 
and that the government will convey "the international 
community's mood" and the fact that "there is a limit to the 
flexibility of the United States and the ROK" through former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 in its "Today 
and Tomorrow" column a 1,000-word article by senior reporter 
Choe Maeng- ho entitled "The `Level of Crisis' on the Korean 
Peninsula." The article remarks on the lack of attention to 
security on the part of the people because they think "North 
Korea cannot afford to carry out a war" and believe "it will not 
provoke a war unless the United States attacks first." Noting 
that the purchase of emergency food supplies does not seem to be 
motivated by serious anxiety, the article ascribes the people's 
"lack of security sense" to the feeling "there would be no 
particular way out even if a war takes place." 
  After touching on the government's "inconsistent policy on 
North Korea" and stressing that "the situation regarding the 
nuclear issue is certainly developing into a crisis," the 
article concludes by urging the government and people to make 
every effort to "avoid the possible demise of both South and 
North Korea." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "North Korea's Reckless Run to Withdrawal 
From the IAEA." The editorial denounces North Korea's withdrawal 
from the agency as "a serious challenge and an illicit act that 
has devastated the international order," and warned against 
North Korea's aim to "bargain over the nuclear inspection issue 
only with the United States, excluding the IAEA." The editorial 
stresses the need to "sternly proceed with imposing pressure and 
UN Security Council gradual sanctions on North Korea in close 
cooperation among the ROK, the United States, and Japan until 
North Korea retreats from its withdrawal from the IAEA and 
allows an overall nuclear inspection" [chonmyon haek sachal]. 
The editorial also emphasizes that "exclusive negotiations 
between the United States and North Korea should be held after 
North Korea returns to the IAEA and allows the inspection." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
900-word 
editorial entitled "North Korea's Adventurous Choice" analyzing 
the reason for North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. The 
editorial analyzes this action by North Korea as "a reaction 
against the agency's repeated acts, unfavorable to North Korea, 
following the United States" and as an expression of its 
"determination to be separated from the IAEA, which has 
ceaselessly raised new issues even after North Korea allowed 
nuclear inspections." Pointing out the possibility that "the 
keen confrontation between North Korea's strong strategy and the 
U.S. intent to show its stern resolution to punish the North 
will further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula," 
the editorial stresses the need to make efforts to find a way 
"from confrontation to dialogue." The editorial also comments 
on the "need to review closely the reason for North Korea 
remaining in the NPT, after withdrawing from the IAEA."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok by Yi Yun-song on </F>
15 June -- recorded; place not given] 
  [Text] [Yi Yun-song] Sanctions mean war. Therefore, we 
cannot be responsible. This is a threatening remark repeatedly 
being made by the North Korean side. However, sanctions clearly 
attach a precondition that it forces a dialogue. Some people 
are buying large amounts of daily necessities, which is even all 
the more instigating anxiety. We will hear about the current 
situation from Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. Hello, Prime 
Minister. 
  [Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok] Hello. 
  [Yi Yun-song] Even if war does not break out immediately, do 
we have to be prepared for even the slightest possibility? 
  [Prime Minister Yi] Yes, we have to be prepared. There is a 
saying: Be prepared, and you will have no cause for regrets. I 
believe that we must be prepared for even the slightest 
possibility so that we can live in security. A civil defense 
exercise was carried out today. People are wondering if it was 
carried out because of the current troubled situation. That is 
not so. We are to hold civil defense exercises twice a year in 
June and September. I want to clearly say that today's exercise 
was no more than a scheduled exercise, it was not carried out 
because an unusual situation has taken place. 
  [Yi Yun-song] The government is worrying about apathy by the 
people regarding security and also over the excessive 
apprehension and crisis awareness. People are even saying that 
they do not know what to think. What is the government's clear 
position? 
  [Prime Minister Yi] I believe that we must differentiate 
between being aware of security and being apprehensive about 
security. Awareness of security means being prepared for the 
slightest possibility of a calamity so that there will be no 
regrets later. Being apprehensive about security is an unsound 
reaction stemming from ignorance over what the current situation 
is and how it will develop. The current situation is a 
situation in which we do not have to be worried. However, there 
exists our counterpart, North Korea. I emphasized the need to 
be aware of security even though we know that they will not dare 
provoke us again when viewing our strong preparations, but we 
must be prepared for the slightest possibility. Being 
apprehensive makes the people act abnormally, such as buying 
large amounts of daily necessaries, which may bring about social 
confusion. I believe North Korea is aiming at social confusion. 
Therefore, we must not react unsoundly without any solid ground 
over the current situation. 
  [Yi Yun-song] From two to three days ago people living in 
well-to-do residential areas started buying large amounts of 
daily necessities. Fortunately most of the people are observing 
the situation and are restraining from impulse purchases. What 
is your view on this matter? 
  [Prime Minister Yi] Since we are under a situation in which 
we are fully prepared, I would like to clearly say that war will 
not break out immediately and would like to ask the people not 
to be worried. I would like to ask the people to assume the 
attitude of always being prepared for the slightest possibility. 
  [Yi Yun-song] Thank you. 
  [Prime Minister Yi] Thank you.

  [Text] On 15 June, the government quickly obtained and has 
already begun examining a draft of the UN Security Council 
resolution for imposing sanctions against the North, which the 
U.S. Government has worked out. Kim Chin-sok has this report: 
  [Begin Kim Chin-sok recording] A draft of the UN Security 
Council resolution for imposing sanctions, which the U.S. 
Government has worked out, was obtained today by our government. 
  One high-ranking government official disclosed: We obtained 
a draft of the resolution for imposing sanctions against the 
North-- which has been approved by U.S. President 
Clinton--through the ROK Embassy in the United States this 
afternoon and have begun examining it. 
  According to the official, the content of the draft follows: 
  First, there will be a one-month grace period before the 
imposition of sanctions. This means sanctions will be imposed 
unless there is a report that relations between North Korea and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] have been 
completely restored within a month. 
  Next, sanctions will be imposed in such a way to ban exports 
of all kinds of weapons to North Korea, in addition to halting 
UN economic, technological, and cultural aid. 
  This draft is more intense than has been reported by foreign 
news reports. 
  In addition, Russia's proposal to hold an international 
conference will be followed if the IAEA reports to the UN 
Security Council that North Korea has agreed to completely 
cooperate with the IAEA. This means that the proposal is not a 
precondition to the imposition of sanctions. 
  Copies of this draft were also distributed today to China, 
Russia, Britain, and France--permanent members of the UN 
Security Council--as well as to our government. 
  The government official explained that since the draft was 
worked out, the United States has already had close 
consultations with our government, and sent a copy of this draft 
to us on a top priority basis. 
  Of course, there is the possibility that the content of this 
draft will be revised to a considerable extent, depending upon 
consultations between the United States and the countries 
concerned, particularly China and Russia. 
  The government's policy is to make all diplomatic efforts to 
ensure our position is fully reflected in this process. [end

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said Wednesday that moves are afoot at the U.N. 
Security Council to complete a draft resolution on North Korea 
this week for adoption in two to three weeks' time. 
  Han made the remark at a meeting of lawmakers and local 
chapter heads from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party held at 
the Lawmakers Hall of the National Assembly. 
  The foreign minister's remarks are understood to signify 
that 
Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] would cause the U.N. resolution to be advanced by 
one week from the original schedule. 
  With regard to China's position on sanctions against 
Pyongyang, Han said, "Intensive diplomatic efforts to win the 
constructive cooperation of China are underway. China is well 
aware that North Korea is accountable for the current critical 
situation of its nuclear row. 
  "Pyongyang's quitting the IAEA will not affect the status of 
the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Therefore, as long 
as North Korea does not quit the NPT, the nuclear safeguards 
accord and inspection obligations with the IAEA remain 
effective," he emphasized.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok said on Wednesday he is positive North Korea will not 
dare to provoke a war against the South. 
  "Preparedness and morale on the part of our Armed Forces are 
higher than any other time in the past, who have the ability to 
crush any North Korean provocation," Yi said. 
  In an interview with the three major televisions in Seoul, 
the premier said that at the moment there is no sign of 
provocation or any unusual military movement in North Korea. 
The prime minister said the fire power of the South Korean and 
U.S. Forces are enormous and the two countries maintain a close 
cooperative system. 
  "Today's civil defense drill was to check our security 
preparedness but the drill was not due to any growing danger of 
war," he said. The premier observed that North Korea seems 
trying to apply some shock therapies like the withdrawal from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. "But, the strategy does 
not go the way they wish," he added.

  [Text] Tourist trips to the truce village of Panmunjom 
have been suspended this week because of repair work at a 
briefing room for tourists at the truce village, a UN Command 
(UNC) spokesman said yesterday. The spokesman said the 
suspension of trips has nothing to do with the tension fueled by 
the North Korean nuclear program. 
  "The briefing room for tourists who come to see Panmunjom 
and 
nearby underground tunnels dug by North Koreans is very old and 
we need to repair it," said Kim Yong-kyu of the UNC. "That's 
why tours to Panmunjom have been temporarily suspended. They 
will resume Monday," said Kim. He denied a news report that the 
suspension of the trips was related to the existing tensions.

  [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said that signs have 
been detected through various sources that North Korea has 
recently been conducting tests for detonators of nuclear bombs. 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said this today at a meeting of 
Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers and local chapter chairmen. 
He said that although there were no signs of North Korea having 
conducted nuclear testing to determine the success of nuclear 
weapons development, he has obtained, from various sources, 
signs that North Korea has been conducting tests of detonators 
used in exploding nuclear bombs. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae 
said that North Korea must therefore have developed a nuclear 
explosion device at least to an elementary stage. 
  Regarding North Korea's recent military moves, Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae said: North Korea has continued 
provocative demonstrations by conducting inspections assessing 
the combat-readiness of the entire armed forces under the 
supervision of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces since the 
middle of last April and by having its party Military Commission 
begin inspections confirming its war preparedness posture. 
  Defense Minister Yi said that in the event of North Korean 
provocation, the ROK will prevent it from spreading into an 
all-out war with an immediate and powerful counterattack. 
Saying that the Defense Ministry is keeping an eye on all the 
North Korean moves through thorough intelligence activities, he 
disclosed 13 military intelligence photographs of the North 
Korean area, including the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon.

  [Text] KYODO News Agency reported on 15 June from New York 
that regardless of the official notification to the United 
States on its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], North Korea is continuing to recognize nuclear 
inspection activities, such as the work to measure and regulate 
inspection machines by the two inspectors dispatched from the 
IAEA. 
  Quoting a U.S. Government official, KYODO News Agency 
reported that North Korea had hinted that it would expel the 
inspectors when it declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, but it 
seems that North Korea allowed inspection activities by the IAEA 
inspectors to avoid strong measures against the North by the 
international community, such as the strengthening of economic 
sanctions by the UN Security Council. 
  This official also said it is important that the inspectors 
carry out activities, not that they are still in North Korea. 
He hinted that the content of the sanction resolution against 
the North will be influenced if the inspectors are expelled. 
  He also said that as long as North Korea allows the 
inspectors to continue inspection activities, sanctions by the 
UN Security Council will not be strengthened abruptly. In 
particular, he said that the withdrawal from the IAEA and the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by North Korea are 
significantly different, and emphasized that it is necessary for 
North Korea to implement the requirements of the NPT. Thus, he 
did not attach much importance to the fact that North Korea 
withdrew from the IAEA.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States have shifted into top gear to conduct joint 
intelligence surveillance of North Korean military activities, 
sources at the Defense Ministry said Wednesday. 
  The allied forces took the action after determining that the 
chances of an unexpected military provocation by North Korea are 
high following its withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, the sources said. 
  The United States is expected to increase the intensity of a 
draft resolution on U.N. sanctions against North Korea. 
Pyongyang has said it would regard the imposition of sanctions 
as an act of war. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said last week that South 
Korean and U.S. military forces have completed preparations for 
three possible stages -- the beginning of sanctions, limited 
North Korean provocations and an all-out war. 
  The intelligence surveillance operation would go into full 
operation if and when sanctions were imposed, Yi said. 
  At present, the United States and South Korea have deployed 
U-2R reconnaissance aircraft, E-3C early warning planes, KH-9 
spy satellites and all other possible means to monitor North 
Korean movements around the clock while thoroughly analyzing the 
pictures and information gathered, the sources said. 
  Washington has already sent military analysts and 
intelligence officials to South Korea to support the operation, 
they added. 
  The South Korean military, meanwhile, is rechecking its 
decision- making system in order to meet possible limited 
provocations by North Korea, and strengthening the defense of 
public and government buildings and facilities and military 
command posts that could be targeted in a North Korean attack, 
they said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The Citizens Coalition 
for Economic Justice on Wednesday asked the United States to 
stop making acts of fomenting a "war atmosphere" on the Korean 
peninsula for the sake of its own national interests. 
  In a statement it issued in connection with the North Korean 
nuclear question, the coalition stressed that the Untied States 
should refrain from making provocative remarks such as "military 
sanctions being considered." 
  "In particular, the United States should not take any 
military actions that could be regarded by North Korea as the 
provocation of a war," it said. 
  Emphasizing that no fratricidal war should recur between the 
same people, the coalition said the South Korean Government 
should display the intent of resolving the matter through 
dialogue while North Korea should ensure nuclear transparency 
under the basic South-North agreement.

  [Text] Paris, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The United States had 
accepted the principle of U.S. military withdrawal from South 
Korea in a "secret agreement" signed with North Korea last 
February, the French daily LIBERATION quoting a senior North 
Korean official here reported Wednesday. 
  The report said that the official, Pak Tong-chun, head of 
the 
North Korean mission in Paris, claimed that Washington accepted 
the principle of pulling 37,000 American troops out of South 
Korea under the frame of a "secret" bilateral agreement which 
was agreed in December 1993 in New York and concluded last 
February. 
  "The United States asked us not to leak this, but they 
breached all the promises later," Pak was quoted as saying. 
  The daily said Pak failed to produce any evidence and a 
spokesman for the U.S. State Department declined a comment on 
Pak's allegation. 
  Meanwhile, in an interview with the INTERNATIONAL HERALD 
TRIBUNE, Pak denied North Korea's nuclear development but said 
his country is prepared to wage a war if it is necessary to 
safeguard "our essential national interests." He said that any 
North Korean attack on the United States, China or Japan with 
nuclear weapons would be a suicidal act. "We cannot even think 
of attacking South Korea, our same people," Pak told the TRIBUNE. 
  Asserting that the United States had invented all problems 
like the theory of North Korean attack simply to justify their 
presence in South Korea, Pak said that North Korea has reached 
the limit of patience and has no intent of making concessions 
any further.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Yi Chong-su's report from Washington] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that former U.S. President 
Carter, who will visit North Korea today, has a nonofficial 
package offer to solve the North Korean nuclear issue and 
U.S.-North Korean relations simultaneously. 
  In an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System, KBS, 
today a U.S. scholar, who has reportedly played a 
behind-the-scenes role for former U.S. President Carter's visit 
to North Korea, revealed that former President Carter's 
nonofficial package offer contains the improvement of U.S.-North 
Korean relations and the measures for guaranteeing the overall 
security of the Korean peninsula in return for guaranteeing 
North Korea's nuclear transparency. 
  This scholar, who did not want to be identified, said that 
if 
former President Carter achieved no success in his visit to 
North Korea this time, public opinion in the United States would 
quickly turn toward imposing sanctions against North Korea 
within or without the framework of the United Nations.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
conferred with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Chongwadae 
[presidential offices] Tuesday evening on ways to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear question. 
  Carter is set to visit Pyongyang Wednesday morning through 
Panmunjom to discuss the nuclear issue with the North Korean 
leadership. 
  During the talks over dinner that lasted two and half an 
hours, President Kim pointed out that the nuclear question has 
arrived at a critical stage because of Pyongyang's announced 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  A source said the president explained to Carter about the 
Seoul government's firm stance toward the nuclear situation. 
  President Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear 
development should be thwarted by all means and that if 
Pyongyang presses ahead with nuclear development, sanctions 
through the United Nations would be unavoidable, he said. 
  The source said that President Kim asked the former U.S. 
President to convey Seoul's concern and position with regard to 
North Korea's announced withdrawal from the IAEA, and to 
successfully persuade the North Koreans to respond affirmatively 
to international demands. 
  Former President Carter was learned to have explained about 
the purpose of his visit to Pyongyang and promised to relay 
Seoul's position to Pyongyang correctly. 
  After the meeting, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said the 
meeting was held in an amicable atmosphere, adding, however, 
that Kim and Carter decided not to disclose the contents of 
their talks. 
  According to Chu, Carter said he would not discuss his 
mission prior to his visit to Pyongyang, but would explain about 
the feelings he would have during his talks with North Korean 
leaders when he returns to Seoul from the North. 
  On Wednesday morning, Carter would meet Deputy Prime 
Minister 
Yi Hong-ku before leaving for Pyongyang via Panmunjom. 
  He would return to Seoul Saturday morning and meet with 
President Kim.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter crossed through the heavily fortified border 
village of Panmunjom Wednesday on his way to Pyongyang for talks 
with North Korean leader Kim Il-song, hoping to find a solution 
to the nuclear crisis without the United Nations having to 
resort to sanctions. 
  He met with Deputy Premier and Minister of the National 
Unification Board (NUB) Yi Hong-ku earlier in the morning before 
heading for Pyongyang via Panmunjom. 
  Carter also met with President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu Tuesday. 
  The former U.S. leader is scheduled to meet with North 
Korean 
President Kim Il-song Wednesday evening and will likely convey 
the international community's concern over Pyongyang's 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods and abrupt withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  He also plans to inform Kim Il-song of Seoul's and 
Washington's firm position that if Pyongyang does not accept 
IAEA inspections, United Nations sanctions are inevitable. 
  Carter, however, is likely to emphasize that if North Korea 
guarantees nuclear transparency, it can improve its relations 
with the United States and receive economic support from various 
countries, a diplomatic source said. 
  The former president plans to stay in Pyongyang four days 
before returning to Seoul via Panmunjom Saturday to brief 
President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks. 
  He will later hold a press conference to discuss his meeting 
with Kim Il-song before departing from Seoul.

  [Text] Panmunjom, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalyn arrived in the truce village 
of Panmunjom around 10:10 A.M. Wednesday and were taken to Peace 
House on the Southern side of the border by American Ambassador 
James Laney for a 30-minute break before the big crossover. 
  They were led into the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) 
conference room at 10:50 A.M., pulling up in a motorcade of four 
vehicles. The former President, clad in a dark grey suit, 
emerged from a Cadillac with his wife and waved to the press 
without answering any questions. 
  Showing some emotion as he stopped at the Military 
Demarcation Line, which is only about 5cm in width, Carter waved 
at both halves of the divided peninsula for a few minutes. 
  -- Carter came to Seoul once before -- in June 1979 when he 
stayed overnight at Camp Casey -- but this was his first visit 
to Panmunjom. 
  The former U.S. leader will make history of sorts by 
becoming 
the first person to go to the North via Panmunjom and return to 
Seoul, again via the truce village. 
  Previous foreign visitors, including U.S. Rep. Gary Ackerman 
and U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali, had all passed 
through Panmunjom to enter North Korea but flew out directly 
from Pyongyang to Beijing. 
  -- Pak Im-su, deputy chief liaison officer, and two others 
came down from the North Korean side to greet Carter. 
  Forrest Chilton, U.N. secretary to MAC, introduced Carter to 
Pak and the former President headed to the Northern side after a 
brief entry procedure. 
  The ex-first couple posed for the media -- CNN, China's 
XINHUA news agency and Russia's TASS -- again in front of 
Panmungak on the northern side. 
  --The mood was unusually tense on the southern side because 
of the status of the former U.S. President, according to Seoul 
officials. 
  "He may be an ex-President, but the U.S. side is providing 
security as if he were an incumbent," said one official. "A 
mobile task force is waiting within one minute's running 
distance." 
  Inside sources pointed to a significant increase in the 
number of security officials from both the South Korean and 
American military. 
  Two officials from the U.S. Presidential Security Office 
reportedly entered North Korea Monday for a prior safety check, 
attesting to the tight preparations by the U.S. side. 
  The vice director of the International Department at the 
North's Nodong Party, Song Ho-kyong, was spotted on a stairway 
about 30 meters from the demarcation line as part of Pyongyang's 
welcoming committee. He remained aloof until he saw Carter 
arrive in Panmunjom, then trotted down the stairs to welcome him. 
  -- The Carters had to send their luggage ahead two hours in 
advance after regular customs clearance. Officials said the 
procedure was the same as airport customs clearance, conducted 
by customs officials specially dispatched for the day. 
  Later, Chilton made a brief announcement that Carter had 
successfully entered North Korea at the end of the crossover. 
  He said the South had asked the North to guarantee the 
former 
President's safety at the demarcation line, and North Korea 
readily agreed.

  [Text] Former U.S. President Carter, who went to North 
Korea via Panmunjom, met North Korean President Kim Il-song just 
a few minutes ago. Following is a report by Cho Tal-ung: 
  [Begin Cho Tal-ung recording] Before holding a meeting with 
North Korean President Kim Il-song, former U.S. President Carter 
was received by Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam welcomed former U.S. President Carter by using the 
expression my old friend, as if he was an old friend. 
  It was learned that former U.S. President Carter, who is in 
North Korea, met North Korean President Kim Il-song this evening 
and exchanged basic positions regarding the North Korean nuclear 
issue. Concrete contents of the talks, however, has not been 
revealed. It seems that in today's talks only a principled 
position was conveyed and opinions on concrete matters were not 
exchanged. 
  Western sources view that while staying in Pyongyang for 
three nights and four days, after exchanging views on 
multifaceted measures with the high-ranking leaders of North 
Korea to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, former 
President Carter will meet with President Kim Il-song again to 
carry out a final negotiation. 
  Former President Carter arrived in Panmunjom at 1010 [0110 
GMT] with his wife Rosalyn and his entourage by car and after a 
brief entry procedure, they went to the North by riding in 16 
cars after being guided by North Korea Deputy Foreign Minister 
Song Ho-kyong at Panmunjak. After arriving in Pyongyang, former 
President Carter was welcomed by Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam 
and they talked for a moment. Then he was guided to the state 
guest house. 
  Former President Carter and his entourage will return to 
Seoul on 18 June via Panmunjom and explain to President Kim 
Yong-sam the result of his visit to North Korea and leave Seoul 
after holding a news conference summing up his visit to South 
and North Korea. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Chongwadae [presidential 
offices] is closely watching Jimmy Carter's visit to North 
Korea, concerned that Pyongyang may utilize the former U.S. 
President's meeting with strongman Kim Il-song for propaganda 
purposes both at home and abroad as well as for a political 
compromise. 
  A knowledgeable source said Wednesday that if Carter is 
greeted by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong at 
Panmunjom, it might be a North Korean tactic to turn his visit 
into a political negotiation between Washington and Pyongyang. 
The source pointed out that "We have to watch with concern how 
the high-ranking official greets him at Panmunjom." 
  He said, "North Korea has made it a rule to greet former 
heads of state through the chairman or staff of the Committee 
for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries." He speculated 
that having a Foreign Ministry official meet Carter at Panmunjom 
would signal political negotiation rather than a cordial 
reception. 
  As to reports that Chinese President Jiang Zemin refused to 
discuss the North Korean nuclear problem with President Clinton 
over the phone, he explained, "China seems discontent that 
Pyongyang has not consulted beforehand with it on the 
announcement to quit the International Atomic Energy Agency."

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam stressed today that the 
government is fully prepared to handle any provocation from 
North Korea. 
  At Chongwadae [presidential offices] today, President Kim 
held a meeting with businessmen, including the presidents of 
finance institutions. There he pointed out that the people's 
insensitivity to national security is a problem. At the same 
time, however, people should not be uneasy about national 
security. He also stressed that, as the president, he should 
safeguard the state and defend people's lives and property and 
he has been mapping out solid countermeasures to be fully 
prepared to ward off any provocation from North Korea. People 
may have trust in the president and government. 
  President Kim expressed strong confidence in national 
security by stating: We can handle, in a brief space of time, a 
provocation from North Korea because the government is 
maintaining an unprecedentedly solid system of cooperation 
between the ROK and the United States; because the government is 
maintaining an around-the-clock system to watch the North; 
because the morale in the military is higher than ever before as 
politically oriented soldiers have been removed; and because our 
firing power and maneuverability are in an excellent status. 
  President Kim made it clear once again: The government is 
coping with the matters related to the North on the basis of the 
great principle that North Korea should not possess nuclear 
capability and that peace on the Korean peninsula should be 
maintained. Although North Korea is showing an unstable and 
shocking attitude toward the United States through withdrawing 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency, all of their 
strategies are not working as they planned. 
  President Kim predicted that the countries concerned at the 
UN Security Council are now fine-tuning the wording of sanctions 
against North Korea. They will put sanctions into action in two 
or three weeks after they complete their consultations on the 
intensity of the sanctions. They will heighten the intensity of 
sanctions gradually. 
  President Kim asked the financiers to make efforts, equipped 
with confidence in national security, to achieve this year's 
goal of 6 percent economic growth, to keep the increase in 
commodity prices under 6 percent, and to achieve an annual 
export goal of $90 billion.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The presidential office 
has gone on alert -- this time not to counter North Korea but to 
soothe a South Korean public shaken by the shadow of war. 
  The stock market plummeted over 19 points Tuesday on the 
announcement of North Korea's withdrawal from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Pyongyang's pledge to go to war 
if necessary in case of U.N. sanctions. 
  Food hoarding has begun as anxious shoppers thronged 
supermarkets to stock up on groceries and the country held a 
large-scale mock war drill on Wednesday. 
  The presidential office has made an inner judgement, based 
on 
around-the-clock monitoring of the North Korean military and the 
border, that there are no clear signs of a coming war. But 
presidential aides decided it was time to take action when food 
hoarding and other signs of creeping war anxiety emerged this 
week. 
  Chief Secretary Pak Kwan-yong called in all senior 
presidential aides for a meeting Wednesday morning to seek input 
on how to provide assurances on the country's security 
capabilities while administering a dose of reality on imminent 
U.N. sanctions against North Korea. 
  Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said after the meeting 
that all participants agreed sanctions will not lead to 
immediate war as North Korea has suggested, but that they are a 
means to draw Pyongyang back to the negotiating table to resolve 
the nuclear crisis. 
  In other words, they decided the people must realize that 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his regime will resort to 
dialogue only when they are taken to the edge of the cliff, Chu 
said. 
  At the same time, they wanted to build up public confidence 
and the government's credibility in terms of national security, 
he said. 
  "Some people are buying up instant noodles and rice because 
they are inclined more toward the North Korean war rhetoric that 
sanctions mean immediate war," said the spokesman. "We want to 
convince the people that although the public and the government 
do stand ready for the possibility of war, they have to behave 
calmly so that they don't jumble up the entire distribution 
network." 
  But equally important, the public must be made to understand 
the exact situation on the Korean peninsula and what is 
happening on the North Korean nuclear problem so that they can 
be ready for even a 0.1 percent chance of war, according to 
officials. 
  The sources said the meeting's participants held the foreign 
media partly responsible for South Koreans' war anxiety, citing 
the arrival of special news teams to cover the tense situation 
and exaggerated coverage of what is really going on. 
  President Kim Yong-sam personally instructed the Foreign and 
Defense ministries to keep reporters briefed on all changes so 
they can relay the news to the public, and the two ministries 
are expected to carry out the instruction from Thursday.

  [Text] This is a military news report. 
  The 1994 reserve generals' advisory council meeting was held 
on 14 June at the War Buddies' Hall in the War Memorial, where 
some 200 people participated, including Yi Yang-ho, chief of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff; high-ranking Armed Forces leaders; and 
reserve generals of the Army, Navy, and the Air Force. 
  The meeting was held to discuss pending military issues 
through explanations about the National Defense policy and the 
latest North Korean military situation. Our Armed Forces' 
military readiness posture related to North Korea's nuclear 
issue and major national defense policies were discussed at the 
meeting. 
  In a speech delivered prior to today's meeting, General Yi 
said: Under the circumstances in which tension is mounting on 
the Korean peninsula because of the latest North Korea's nuclear 
issue, our Armed Forces are completely equipped with military 
preparedness on the basis of the ROK-U.S. military relations. 
  General Yi continued to say: The issue of redeeming the 
peacetime operational command right--on which an agreement was 
reached between high-ranking military officials concerned of the 
ROK and the United States last year--seems to be settled before 
the end of this year. We are planning to develop the Armed 
Forces through the promotion of military exchanges and 
cooperation with neighboring nations. 
  (Cho Song-tae), chief of the Policy-making Office of the 
Ministry of National Defense, said that our Armed Forces' 
military preparedness related to North Korea's nuclear issue is 
solid. He added that we are mapping out all military 
countermeasures against an emergency on the basis of the 
ROK-U.S. combined military capability. 
  Cho analyzed: North Korea is now suffering from triple 
hardships--an unrest inside its own system, an economic crisis, 
and an international isolation brought about by the nuclear 
issue. To solve these problems, North Korea is capable of 
launching an accidental provocation at any time. Our Armed 
Forces are building up military preparedness to give immediate 
punishment against this. 
  In today's meeting, the director of the Intelligence on 
North 
Korea Department and the director of the Strategic Planning 
Department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters gave 
explanations about pending military tasks and also had in-depth 
discussions with the participants.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government is devising a strong punitive and retaliatory 
strategy against possible military provocation by North Korea in 
case the UN Security Council slaps economic sanctions on 
Pyongyang, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said Wednesday. 
  Speaking at a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers 
and local chapter chairmen, Yi said North Korea had completed 
war preparations by July 27, 1993, stockpiling military supplies 
and expanding and strengthening underground facilities after 
forming a separate war preparation command. 
  Yi said, however, there were no particular signs of North 
Korean military movements related to possible provocation at 
present. 
  The government is strengthening the country's military 
preparedness in stages while drawing up joint defense strategy 
with the U.S. Forces, Yi said. 
  He also said that North Korea is believed to have extracted 
enough plutonium to make one or two nuclear weapons. Although 
it is not certain if the North has a complete nuclear bomb, he 
said he could not rule out the possibility of Pyongyang having 
developed a primitive explosive device. 
  With regard to military cooperation between the United 
States 
and South Korea in case of North Korean provocation, Yi said he 
and his U.S. counterpart are in constant contact through a hot 
line. Moreover, he said the two countries are ready to hold 
urgent security and military conferences in times of emergency.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- A civil defense exercise, 
including an air-raid drill, was conducted for 20 minutes across 
the country Wednesday afternoon. 
  In view of the tension over North Korea's nuclear program, 
the exercise stressed war preparedness for the first time since 
1992, when the focus was shifted to preparations for such 
disasters as floods and earthquakes. 
  In Seoul, an air-raid siren sounded at 2:00 P.M. and a 
yellow smoke bomb was set off in front of the Daewoo building at 
2:05, indicating that the building had been "hit" by a chemical 
bomb. 
  Toxicity fighting units rushed to the building and 
ambulances 
and first-aid teams evacuated 30 "injured" people from the 
building to eight hospitals, including the Red Cross hospital. 
  At 2:08, black smoke spewed from the building's third and 
ninth floors, indicating they had been hit by bombs. Fire 
trucks brought the blaze under control while rescue teams 
evacuated people from the building with ropes. Destroyed power 
and telephone lines and water pipes were repaired immediately. 
  Participating in the air-raid drill at the building were 33 
vehicles, including 16 fire trucks and nine ambulances, 400 
civil servants and Daewoo civil defense corps members. 
  Other people in the building were evacuated to its 
basements. 
  In addition, a vehicular traffic control drill took place on 
a road near Chungnang-chon River, assuming that the road had 
been inundated. 
  No military aircraft, such as helicopters, were used in the 
exercise because of inconvenience caused to citizens and for 
fear that North Korea would use the move in its anti-South 
propaganda offensive, officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The government, expecting 
that the tension over North Korea's withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will drag on, has 
begun monitoring the prices of basic consumer goods such as 
rice, ramyon (instant noodles) and jewelry, as well as the stock 
market, every day. No hoarding of daily necessities has yet 
been observed, but the supply shortages and resulting runaway 
inflation expected from a steep escalation in tension would 
throw the economy into confusion, officials said Wednesday. To 
prepare for an emergency, the government has started checking 
fluctuations of consumer prices and the supply and demand of key 
consumer goods on a daily basis, they added. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is 
monitoring the prices of rice and other farm products, the 
Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea movements in the 
financial markets such as interest rates, withdrawals, share 
prices and foreign investment, the ministry of trade, industry 
and energy the prices of manufactured goods, and the Ministry of 
Transportation foreign tourist arrivals. 
  No unusual price movements for such items as rice and ham 
have been detected, the Economic Planning Board said. 
  The government has started daily price checks in preparation 
for unexpected developments after North Korea bolted from the 
IAEA, but nothing unusual has been observed so far, a board 
official said. 
  The government's daily checks come as tensions are expected 
to rise in the wake of North Korea's abrupt withdrawal, he 
added. In case the situation worsens and the economy weakens, 
the government will set in motion an emergency system. 
  Purchases of food, fuel, first-aid drugs, flashlights and 
candles for emergencies are increasing and some prices are on 
the rise.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] urged the government Wednesday to forge an 
independent nuclear policy, including re-examination of the 
Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  The appeal was contained in an announcement on the party's 
basic position and policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
The DLP issued the statement after a meeting of party lawmakers 
and local chapter chairmen in the morning. 
  It was the first time the ruling party has enunciated the 
need to form an independent nuclear policy and reconsider the 
denuclearization declaration. 
  Heated debate has occurred among segments in the ruling 
party 
and the Kim Yong-sam administration over whether South Korea 
must take another look at the declaration as North Korea has 
been systematically and impudently violating the declaration. 
  In a statement read by DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin, the 
ruling 
party again urged Pyongyang to implement the inter-Korean 
accords and the Denuclearization Declaration issued Dec. 31, 
1991. 
  "North Korea should also stop developing nuclear weapons 
immediately and in order to prove it, it should retract its 
decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency," Pak said. 
  The DLP is urging North Korea to accept unconditional and 
comprehensive IAEA inspections not only to maintain nuclear 
transparency in the future but also to assist international 
efforts to determine its nuclear activities in the past, the 
spokesman said. 
  The DLP statement asked the international community to 
cooperate in U.N. sanctions against North Korea aimed at 
resolving the nuclear dispute. Addressing the Kim 
administration, the statement said the government should prepare 
thoroughly for the effective execution of sanctions within the 
framework of international rules and the United Nations. 
  The party said the country ought to establish law and order 
and tight national security by liquidating "left-leaning" 
forces, including the radical student organization Hanchongnyon, 
which are "openly and publicly supporting the North's 
dictatorial regime under an anachronistic illusion and without 
realizing the changes taking place worldwide." 
  In addition, the party expressed concern that if national 
policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute is divided in a 
crisis, it may induce a misjudgement on the part of the 
Pyongyang regime. 
  All South Koreans should unite against the North's ambition 
to conquer by force and communize the South, the statement said. 
  Earlier in the meeting, DLP leaders received reports from 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae 
on the U.S.- drafted sanctions resolution and military 
activities in the North.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The leaders of two 
splinter parties called Wednesday for an end to 
government-opposition political strife until the nuclear row 
with North Korea is settled. 
  In a joint statement issued that day, Chairman Kim Tong-kil 
of the United People's Party and Chairman Park Chan-chong of the 
New Political Reform Party also urged social organizations to 
halt internal strife and concentrate on easing the tension over 
North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  They warned that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency would lead to "a dangerous 
consequence of threatening to break the peace and security on 
the Korean peninsula," urging the North to "suspend all military 
intimidation and resume inter-Korean dialogue for a peaceful 
solution of the nuclear problem." 
  The government should establish a national consensus on how 
to overcome the crisis before the inter-Korean confrontation 
over the nuclear issue leads to a tragic result, they said, 
calling for an emergency national meeting on the current 
situation and an inter-Korean summit. 
  They charged that the government's fickle and unprincipled 
policy has pushed the nuclear issue to a critical phase and that 
President Kim Yong-sam is partly responsible as he has wavered 
from the basic principle of Seoul's North Korea policy.
