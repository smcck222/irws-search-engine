"Left-Leaning Trend in Student and Labor Movements Causes 
Worries"] 
  [Text] In addition to the recent investigation of core 
members of the National Federation of University Student 
Councils [Hanchongnyon], the prosecutor's office and police 
began to investigate dissident and labor movements that are 
carrying out procommunist acts benefiting the enemy. This being 
the recent situation, the people are seriously worried about 
left-leaning procommunist forces. These forces, who were held 
back in the past, have become active recently. People pointed 
out this is the result of relaxed anticommunist consciousness 
and of failure to properly implement the functions of public 
security organizations since the civilian government was 
inaugurated. This paper carries an in-depth examination of the 
true aspects of the "left-leaning procommunist forces" in our 
society, as well as of the failure in public security functions. 
  As clearly elucidated by party Secretary Kim Chong-il in his 
work, "Historic Experiences in Socialist Construction and Our 
Party's General Line: Let us have a sense of confidence to 
enter a new stage of socialist construction by firmly 
maintaining the chuche cause expelling all challenges at home 
and abroad." This article, which reminds one of a teaching of 
the North Korean Workers' Party, was carried in a document of 
the Hanchongnyon's Central Standing Committee last February. 
  Even though the entire student movement has been recently 
weakened, the prosecutor office's and police have launched a 
roundup of core members of Hanchongnyon because they accept 
North Korean allegations without questions and because their 
"ideological radicalism" has deepened. 
  Besides, this year the student movement has launched a 
powerful offensive against the incumbent regime, unlike last 
year. This worked as a factor that keyed up public security 
authorities, whose main mission is to maintain public order and 
stability of the system. 
  The 1994 document of Hanchongnyon's deputies defined the 
incumbent regime as a "colonial regime with subordinative and a 
comprador nature to the U.S. imperialists." Thus, public 
security authorities observe that the degree of attack on the 
present regime has strengthened remarkably compared to that in 
the early stage of the civilian government. 
  It is a general view that such "ideological radicalism" of 
the student movement has deepened since the collapse of Eastern 
Europe. 
  So-called Marxism-Leninism believers and the chuche idea 
faction [Chusapa]--two leading factions of the student movement 
in the 1980's--have been unable to clearly explain the collapse 
of the socialist camp with existing theories. 
  This being the case, the Marxist-Leninist camp developed a 
"Trotsky faction," which inherited Trotsky's idea, Russia's 
communist, on international communism, while Chusapa's 
ideological dependence on Kim Il-song's chuche idea has been 
deepened. 
  "The Revolutionary International Socialist Workers Union" 
[Hyoksano]--a transformed Marxist-Leninist faction--was formed 
in November 1992. Since Hyoksano was formed, it organized 
regional committees in Seoul, Ulsan, Masan, and Changwon, and 
branch chapters in Inchon and Anyang. Thus, it has a nationwide 
organizational system. 
  Hyoksano even dispatched its members to the consultation 
office for foreign workers located in Kurodong, Seoul, and 
propagandized the idea of international communism to the illegal 
foreign workers. Thus, Hyoksano is keenly interested in 
international solidarity of socialist workers. 
  The prosecutor's office arrested 11 major class members of 
Hyoksano in November 1993. However, the people view that the 
forces of this organization, which has a deep and firm 
foundation in labor circles, have not been completely eliminated. 
  In particular, the prosecutor's office revealed that North 
Korean revolutionary songs, including "The Fatherland Is One," 
were among the songs sung by the workers of the "K" industrial 
firm in Inchon during their strike, and 170 out of 366 leaflets 
spread in industrial sites last year propagandized the socialist 
revolutionary idea, going beyond the limit of the average 
workers movement. Thus, the prosecutor's office believes that 
left-leaning ideology is expanding. 
  Meanwhile, the Chusapa, which is leading the student 
movement, maintains that the collapse of Eastern Europe is an 
inevitable result of following Marxism-Leninism without 
criticism, and to solve this problem, people should assume the 
chuche idea as an ideological base. 
  "Let us decorate the anti-U.S. and antiwar struggle with 
victory with indomitable spirit, and achieve the brilliant cause 
of great national unity amid the fierce wind of a confederal 
system." 
  This is the content of leaflets spread during the meeting of 
unification forerunners in Suwon campus of Kyonghui University 
last March. As shown in their leaflets, the students use the 
exact same words as North Korea. 
  The result of the prosecutor's office investigation of 
documents confiscated from Hanchongnyon's planning department 
last April shows that the recordings of the "Voice of National 
Salvation," North Korea's clandestine broadcasting network 
directed at South Korea, numbered more than half of the total of 
149, and that most of the leaflets they spread were 
reproductions of North Korean allegations. 
  People also point out that animation of the movement of some 
"left-leaning procommunist" forces is a result of the 
curtailment of public security functions. Thus, the people call 
for "early recovery" of public security functions. 
  It is true that the Agency for National Security Planning, 
the prosecutor's office, the police, and other public 
security-related agencies dealing with procommunist criminals, 
were criticized as an advance guard for security of the regime 
and as a means to suppress democratic movements under the 
authoritarian governments in the past. The scale of these 
organizations was also expanded according to the degree of 
necessity for maintaining their political system. 
  However, since the civilian government was inaugurated, the 
number of student movement organizations has decreased, and 
dissident figures, who carried out antigovernment struggles, 
have now joined the government, thus changing the atmosphere. As 
a result, consciousness of the importance of public security has 
been relatively weakened, and each public security office 
reduced its staff or transferred its members to public welfare 
and intelligence fields. 
  Public security-related officials candidly admit that 
because 
of this atmosphere, investigators in the anticommunist domain 
almost suspended their operation until Hanchongnyon's 
procommunist acts benefiting the enemy became an issue. 
  The number of criminals who were detained on charges of 
violating the National Security Law was 449 in 1990; 320 in 
1991, and 305 in 1992. However, as if to prove the 
security-related officials' remarks, the number of criminals 
drastically decreased to 122 in 1993 when the civilian 
government was inaugurated. As of late May this year, 69 figures 
are detained. 
  Reduction in the number of detainees reflects the gradual 
disappearance of cases in which public security authorities 
unreasonably applied laws and regulations, and curtailment of 
the overall movement. On the other hand, this means that the 
morale of anticommunist investigators declined because 
security-related authorities were treated lightly and 
accordingly, their investigations were passive. 
  The investigators complain that with the demoted position of 
security-related offices, they can hardly carry out even 
essential investigations. 
  A security-related official in the prosecutor's office said 
that it is true that the past regimes abused public security to 
maintain security of the regime, and carried out unreasonable 
investigations. As a result, disputes over human rights 
violations took place ceaselessly, and people held unfavorable 
views about security- related authorities. However, since the 
times have changed, consciousness of the authorities and people 
should also change. Besides, support for security-related 
offices should increase so public security functions can 
actively cope with recent left-leaning procommunist movements.

CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Chon Yuk, CHUNGANG ILBO managing editor: "Are </F>
State Secrets Protected Properly?"] 
  [Text] Every power struggle or international competition 
involves a fierce intelligence war. Therefore, how a state or 
organization steals or protects secrets demonstrates its overall 
management ability. And it often serves as a key factor 
determining victory or defeat. 
  In the Sixth Republic era, President No Tae-u and Kim 
Yong-sam, then chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], 
frequently waged such war against each other. The first 
confrontation came in about April 1990, shortly after the 
three-party merger. At the time, Pak Chol-on, then minister of 
state, who was wielding real power as President No's virtual 
alter ego, fired the first shot with his remark: "If I open my 
mouth ...." Kim Yong-sam responded by facing President No at 
Chongwadae over a Manila envelope he carried with him. Taking 
out a document from the envelope, he said to the president, 
"Such covert operations against me...! I might as well take to 
the streets and die at the hands of people, but not at your and 
your men's hands." 
  The document he pulled out was a top-secret plan concerning 
a 
so-called operation to incapacitate YS [Kim Yong-sam], which 
President No had been briefed about by So Tong-kwon, director of 
the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], a few days 
earlier and which he asked his chief secretary, No Chae-pong, to 
study. The president was so shocked that he sent for his 
physician following YS's departure. NSP Director So lost face 
with the president and No Chae-pong, the chief secretary, came 
under a secret NSP investigation. Chongwadae staff would recall 
that the incident made President No realize, with fear, YS's 
terrible destructive power for the first time. 
  In another round, YS found himself the loser. In the summer 
of 1991, he went to Cheju, ostensibly on vacation. While there, 
he staged, in part openly, a demonstration demanding an early 
nomination by the president for him as the DLP's presidential 
candidate. President No had repeatedly cautioned YS to refrain 
from raising issues relating to a political agenda as the 
president still had 19 months to serve. And this defiance by YS 
infuriated the president. 
  President No called in YS, who had just returned from Cheju, 
to show him a document--a list of campaign pledges prepared by a 
research institute run by YS' close aide. The list began with "I 
will thoroughly liquidate the military culture." 
  "Do you think that you should be allowed to do things like 
this already?" President No demanded. The revelation enraged YS. 
He summoned the aide and told him to "get lost--to America or 
wherever." 
  There was a time YS implicitly showed off his information 
gathering power to President No. In about September 1991, when 
Chongwadae and the NSP were unaware of opposition merger 
negotiations under way between Kim Tae-chung and Yi Ki-taek, the 
president heard for the first time what was going on from YS at 
one of their weekly meetings. The result was that the president 
took action against the NSP officials concerned, censuring them 
for the blunder. "No one knows better about Kim Tae-chung than I 
do," said YS to the president, with evident pride. 
  Leaks of secrets in the Sixth Republic were so bad that 
people called the Administration a "water-like government." 
Former President Chon Tu-hwan, then in exile at Paektamsa, a 
Buddhist temple, was fully aware of visible and invisible 
pressures which Chongwadae and the NSP were then applying on him. 
  A typical case was the "Lake Leman plan" designed to banish 
Mr. Chon overseas against his wishes to return to his Yonhuidong 
home. Upon discovering the plan, Mr. Chon, taking it as the last 
straw, phoned to President No protesting vehemently. He also 
kept a recording of the telephone conversation. 
  Espionage war like this waged between the present and former 
state leaders shows how easily core secrets and information of 
the government can be leaked in a climate that mixes up public 
and private interests. At the same time, it raises concern over 
the fact that our state secrets are being utilized more as tool 
of internal power struggle than for national security, because 
the loophole can lead to leaks of national security secrets. 
  Chongwadae is said to be extremely sensitive to security 
these days in the wake of a secret visit to Korea of James 
Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 
which was exposed by press photos. There was also a case of a 
Korean military officer on active duty leaking military secrets 
to a Japanese correspondent. In yet another case, information on 
a top-secret strategic process in the North-South dialogue was 
exposed by an opposition assemblyman. Chongwadae's concern over 
the continued divulgences is understandable. 
  It is a matter of course that each nation has its secrets 
that, for the sake of protecting and preserving its security and 
interests, cannot be divulged to others. Especially in advanced 
countries, national security and diplomatic secrets, 
confidential internal memos and personnel regulations of 
administrative organizations, and business and personal secrets 
are strictly excluded from the objects of the freedom of 
information by law. At the same time, there are established 
criteria governing what are state secrets and who should protect 
them, as well as the balance of the freedom of information and 
that of speech. 
  In comparison, Korea seems to have many problems with its 
management of state secrets, in principle and in ability. 
Deplorable indeed are abuses of such secrets for the mere 
convenience of the ruler, the slack discipline and the lack of 
ethical standards in this country, as seen in the Sixth Republic 
case of a Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for 
diplomatic and security affairs--a symbol of national security 
itself--who could easily seek asylum overseas. 
  If the present civilian government can restore the control 
of 
state secrets to where it belongs by correcting the flaws and 
disorder of the Sixth Republic, and without curtailing the 
people's right to know, the accomplishment will by itself save 
the regime from criticism of "incompetency." 
  It can be said that the teaching of Han Feizi that "plans 
succeed when secrets are kept, conspiracies fail when secrets 
leak" is a wise saying touching at the cardinal point of 
information control capability.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan is considering 
lowering the limit on the amount of yen travelers to North Korea 
may carry if the United Nations imposes sanctions against the 
North over its refusal to allow inspections of its suspect 
nuclear program, officials said Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The Foreign Exchange Law sets the limit of the amount of yen 
a traveler can carry abroad at 5 million yen, regardless of 
their destination, but Finance Ministry officials said North 
Korea could be an exception. 
  "It's possible (to lower the ceiling on yen to be carried by 
travelers to North Korea) with an interpretation of the law. It 
could only be (done) with a notice by the finance minister," 
said an official at the ministry's International Finance Bureau. 
  "We are afraid of being told by the United States and others 
that the current ceiling hampers the effect of economic 
sanctions," the official said on condition of anonymity. 
  But an official at the ministry's Customs and Tariff Bureau 
acknowledged that people going to North Korea via third 
countries, such as China, could thwart the special measure. 
  Some ministry officials said the impact of lowering such a 
ceiling will be limited because customs officials estimate the 
amount of yen a traveler to North Korea carries at about 200,000 
to 300,000 yen. 
  Most travelers from Japan to North Korea are among some 
250,000 North Koreans living in Japan, many of whom are 
Japan-born descendants of forced laborers brought over when the 
Korean peninsula was under Japanese rule between the early 1900s 
and 1945. 
  The U.S. has asked Japan to stop the remittance of any money 
to North Korea. 
  Although it is not known how much money is actually sent to 
North Korea from Japan, trade and banking sources estimate the 
sum at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills. 
  In a related development, Japanese commercial banks have 
stopped remitting U.S. dollars to North Korea, although they 
have not halted sending cash in other currencies. Bankers say 
the move is in line with a U.S. law that prohibits U.S. banks 
from remitting dollars to North Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Tuesday [14 June] the government will deal with 
discrimination against Koreans living in Japan in the wake of 
reported assaults on students going to pro-Pyongyang schools. 
"That (Korean) children have been hurt is intolerable," Hata 
told a session of the House of Councilors Budget Committee. 
Hata said he will urge all ministries and agencies to think 
about appeals to stop such racial discrimination. 
  In recent weeks there have been frequent reports of Korean 
students being subjected to abusive language by Japanese and in 
some cases of the ethnic uniforms of female Korean students even 
being ripped to shreds. Police suspect that there must be a 
sense of discrimination against pro-Pyongyang Koreans behind the 
scenes amid the international tension over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear arms development program. 
  National Public Safety Commission Chief Hajime Ishii and 
Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai told the same committee session 
that the situation is "regrettable," adding that the government 
will intensify investigations and improve measures to protect 
foreigners' human rights.

  [Text] Sapporo, June 14 KYODO -- A pro-Pyongyang group of 
Korean residents demanded Tuesday [12 June] that police 
apologize for investigating a 24-year-old member of the group on 
unsubstantiated suspicion of violating a stimulant drug control 
law. 
  The Committee for the Protection of the Rights of Koreans in 
Hokkaido, part of the Hokkaido Chapter of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun), made the 
demand at a press conference, claiming the investigation was 
illegal. The accusation followed a recent mistaken raid on the 
office of another Chongnyun chapter and related facilities in 
Kyoto, where local police said earlier Tuesday it will issue a 
statement expressing regret over the incident. 
  The committee said officers from the Chuo police station in 
Sapporo raided the home of the unidentified Korean man, a 
company executive in the city, on May 31 and forced him to give 
a urine sample for testing, but could find no evidence he had 
violated the law. The committee discovered the result of the 
test when it asked the police about the investigation June 2. 
The man, whose nationality is South Korean but who belongs to 
the pro-Pyongyang group, told the committee he suffered mental 
stress as a result of the investigation and his business had 
also suffered, the committee said. The police gave the man no 
explanation either before or after the investigation, it said. 
  Chae Hong-chol, head of the International Division of 
Chongnyun's Hokkaido Chapter, told the press conference he feels 
the police are hostile to Koreans and should have been more 
cautious considering the recent controversial raids on Chongnyun 
offices in Osaka and Kyoto. 
  Toshiaki Igarashi, deputy head of the police station, said 
the raid was legal because it was done with the authorization of 
the court.

  [Text] Kyoto, June 14 KYODO -- The Kyoto Prefectural 
Police Department announced Tuesday [14 June] it will soon issue 
a statement expressing regret over its mistaken raid earlier 
this month on the offices of a pro-Pyongyang group of Korean 
residents in the prefecture. 
  The Kyoto police said it will present the document to the 
Kyoto Chapter of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyun) and other Chongnyun-related groups raided on 
unjustified suspicion of violating the National Land Utilization 
Law. 
  The statement will be issued under the name of Hisao 
Asakura, 
head of the crime prevention department of the prefectural 
police, officials said. It will repeat the police's view on the 
raid, saying that false information obtained from the Kyoto 
municipal government is to blame for the mistake, but that the 
Kyoto police regret the trouble given to the Chongnyun groups, 
they said. However, Chongnyun demands the Kyoto police 
apologize, not just regret. 
  Police searched 27 Chongnyun-related sites after it was 
tipped by the Kyoto City Government that the group contravened 
the law obliging purchasers of land to report the deal to 
authorities. More than eight hours after the raid, the city 
found evidence that the group had reported the purchase of a 
43,000-square-meter plot of land it obtained to relocate its 
school. 
  The Kyoto police decided to issue the statement after the 
National Police Agency (NPA) instructed it to convey the feeling 
of regret clearly, officials said. The NPA also issued a 
memorandum Tuesday to all prefectural police departments in 
connection with the mistaken raid, asking the heads of the 
prefectural police forces to be cautious in investigations and 
keep in mind "the rare case" of the raid in Kyoto.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- North Korea's possible 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 
depends on moves taken by the United States, a senior official 
of Pyongyang's ruling party was quoted as saying Wednesday. 
  Kim Yong-gon [name as received], deputy head of the Korean 
Workers Party's International Department, brushed aside 
allegations of North Korea's nuclear arms development during a 
meeting in Pyongyang with two visiting House of Representatives 
members of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
LDP officials said. Kim called the alleged nuclear arms 
development a fabrication and a plot aimed at isolating North 
Korea from the international community, the officials said, 
quoting reports received from the two, including former Defense 
Agency Chief Taku Yamasaki. 
  In response to the LDP members' call for North Korea to stay 
in the NPT regime, Kim said its withdrawal "depends on what 
action the U.S. will take," the officials said. He also said 
Pyongyang "will counter dialogue with dialogue, sanctions with 
reprisals, and war with war," they added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan has received a draft 
resolution the United States plans to submit to the UN Security 
council to impose sanctions on North Korea for its suspected 
nuclear arms development program, a chief government spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
  The proposed sanctions "are in no way easygoing," Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said without elaboration.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Wednesday Japan will accept in principle draft 
sanctions against North Korea mapped out by the United States. 
  The proposed sanctions are on the whole close to what Japan 
thinks proper to cope with the nuclear crisis, Kakizawa said 
after an emergency meeting of government leaders called to 
discuss the issue. 
  The U.S. plans to propose a sanctions resolution to the UN 
Security Council over the nuclear standoff triggered by North 
Korea's refusal to allow international inspections of its 
suspected nuclear arms development program.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan will inform the 
United States that it will accept in principle its draft 
sanctions against North Korea to be presented to the U.N. 
Security Council over the nuclear crisis, government officials 
said. 
  "On the whole, (the proposed sanctions) are close to what 
Japan thinks proper, so we will in principle accept them," 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told reporters after attending an 
emergency meeting of government leaders on the nuclear standoff. 
  The United States plans to propose a sanctions resolution to 
the Security Council over the nuclear standoff triggered by 
North Korea's refusal to allow International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) checks of its suspected nuclear arms development 
program. 
  Japanese U.N. Ambassador Hisashi Owada will inform his U.S. 
counterpart of Japan's acceptance of the draft early Thursday 
[16 June], the officials said. 
  They declined to disclose, however, if the draft sanctions 
would include an order to halt bank remittances of cash from 
pro-Pyongyang Koreans living in Japan to North Korea. Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai only said the sanctions would 
"not be easy" for North Korea. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata discussed the nuclear crisis 
with 
Kakizawa, Kumagai and senior foreign ministry officers in the 
meeting at his official residence. In the meeting, Hata said 
there are three principles on which Japan should act in dealing 
with the sanctions, the officials said. These are imposing 
sanctions step by step as a means of maintaining dialogue with 
the North, keeping close contact with the U.S., South Korea and 
other permanent Security Council members, and doing whatever is 
possible within the framework of the Constitution. 
  Also present at the emergency talks were Vice Foreign 
Minister Kunihiko Saito and the ministry's director-general of 
the Foreign Policy Bureau, Shunji Yanai. The Foreign Ministry 
officials were quoted as saying there is a feeling even among 
the 10 nonpermanent Security Council members that the nuclear 
issue cannot be left as it is. 
  The Security Council consists of five permanent members -- 
Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. -- as well as the 10 
nonpermanent members.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa may visit the United States possibly later this month 
or early July for talks with U.S. officials, government sources 
said Wednesday [15 June]. 
  Kakizawa is considering making the trip after the budget for 
fiscal 1994 passes the Diet around June 23 or 24, the sources 
said. 
  He is expected to meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. 
  Kantor has reportedly been urging Kakizawa to visit the U.S. 
to promote talks on bilateral trade framework negotiations. 
  Japan and the U.S. agreed last month to resume the trade 
framework talks, which broke down in February when President 
Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met in 
Washington. 
  The two countries have been holding working-level talks 
since 
then and are scheduled to hold vice ministerial talks in Tokyo 
on June 22 and 23 between Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. 
  Kakizawa is also likely to discuss North Korea's alleged 
nuclear development with Christopher along with measures to be 
taken by the United Nations, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold working group meetings on bilateral trade "Framework" 
talks in Tokyo later this week and next week to discuss 
government procurement areas, the Foreign Ministry announced 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The working group meeting on telecommunications equipment 
will be held Thursday and Friday, and the meeting on medical 
equipment will be held June 22 and 23, both in Tokyo, the 
ministry said. 
  Ministry sources have said vice ministerial-level meetings 
on 
the Framework talks between Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi 
will be held June 22 and 23 in Tokyo. 
  Barshefsky is expected to arrive in Japan on June 21, the 
sources said. 
  Japan and the U.S. agreed in May to restart the Framework 
talks after reaching common ground on the definition of 
objective criteria that it would be both quantitative and 
qualitative yardsticks instead of numerical targets for each of 
the negotiation sectors. 
  Government procurement of medical and telecommunications 
equipment is one of the three priority areas along with 
automobile and auto parts, and insurance business.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry 
has told construction companies to handle on their own an 
expected U.S. lawsuit over allegedly inflated work costs on a 
U.S. naval base due to bid-rigging, ministry sources said 
Tuesday [14 June]. 
  In a move to distance itself from a potentially costly 
bilateral row, the ministry sent a document to a construction 
industry organization, saying each company is responsible for 
coping with the suit, which it says is a civil case, according 
to its own judgment. 
  The document was dated June 6 and sent to the Japan 
Federation of Construction Contractors as a simple liaison. The 
document is in effect designed to make clear to the United 
States that the ministry has nothing to do with the case, a 
senior ministry official said. "We drew up the document to 
remove the misunderstanding within the U.S. Government that the 
ministry is behind the alleged bid-rigging and the companies' 
handling of the issue," the official said on the condition of 
anonymity. "The industry should also supply clear accounts on 
the case for an accurate understanding by the U.S.," he said. 
  The U.S. Government is seeking a total of 1.1 billion yen in 
compensation from some 70 Japanese construction companies for 
the alleged overcharge for work done at the base at Atsugi near 
Tokyo. 
  Rampant alleged collusion to rig bids in construction 
contracts, a practice called "dango," has been criticized by the 
U.S. as a major obstacle to the U.S. companies' entry into the 
Japanese construction market. The U.S. is expected to start 
filing suits in autumn after the new U.S. fiscal year begins. 
U.S. officials recently visited Japan to seek talks with the 
companies involved, but many of them refused meetings, the 
officials said. Washington wrongly views the cold shoulder as a 
move orchestrated by the ministry, they said. The ministry 
stressed in the document that it has given no instructions or 
advice to the companies concerning the case.

  [Text] Nagoya, June 14 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. 
purchased 4.65 billion dollars worth of automobile parts and 
materials from U.S. suppliers during fiscal 1993, up 5 percent 
from the year before, company officials said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  At an annual meeting in San Francisco of North American 
parts 
suppliers exporting to Japan, Toyota's Director, Noritaka 
Shimizu said spending on U.S. parts has grown over four times 
from 1.1 billion dollars in 1988, according to the officials. 
  During fiscal 1993, Toyota's U.S. branches bought 3.51 
billion dollars worth of American parts, while Japan's 
operations spent 1.14 billion dollars. Toyota expects purchases 
for fiscal 1994 will total 5.28 billion dollars, the officials 
said. 
  Toyota says its increase of U.S. parts suppliers from 415 in 
March 1993 to 448 in March 1994 is one reason for the increase 
in purchases, as well as a new factory that opened in March at 
Toyota motor manufacturing, U.S.A. Inc. located in Kentucky.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
may hold subcabinet-level talks next week to find ways to 
improve American access to Japan's auto and auto parts markets, 
a senior Trade Ministry official said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  The two parties are narrowing differences as much as 
possible 
during the current ongoing working-level auto trade talks, said 
the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), who declined to be named. 
  But difficult issues will be left to the next stage of talks 
which may be held next week at the earliest between Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, MITI vice chief for international affairs, and Jeffrey 
Garten, U.S. commerce undersecretary for international trade, 
the official said, indicating that the controversial issue of 
how to set "objective criteria" in gauging openness of Japan's 
auto markets will be suspended. 
  Japan and the U.S. held working-level talks in Tokyo on 
Monday and Tuesday and will continue into an unscheduled third 
day Wednesday. 
  The senior MITI official said the two countries next week 
will resume talks designed to expand foreign access to Japan's 
glass market, a topic newly added to the priority fields of the 
trade "framework" negotiations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
ended three days of working-level auto trade talks in Tokyo 
Wednesday [15 June] apparently without reaching consensus on 
setting "objective criteria" as an instrument to gauge openness 
of Japan's auto market. 
  "Mutual understanding on differences has been deepened," an 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) told a press conference, adding the atmosphere at the 
talks was "cordial." 
  The officials of the two countries met Monday and Tuesday 
and 
then extended their talks for a third day Wednesday, to discuss 
measures to improve the U.S. access to the Japanese auto market 
and criteria to evaluate implementation of the measures, the 
MITI official said. 
  "The Japanese side fully understands the U.S. position, 
including a proposal on the most critical issue," the official 
said. 
  But the official declined to disclose further details of the 
talks, saying both parties agreed to keep quiet. 
  He said issues that have yet to be settled during the latest 
talks will be put on hold until the next round of working-level 
talks, expected to be held in Washington in the second half of 
next week. 
  The latest working-level gathering followed last week's 
subcabinet-level meeting in Tokyo where both parties failed to 
bridge difference over objective criteria, the thorniest issue 
under the bilateral trade "Framework" talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan will not change its 
policy on the planned tax reform in line with a reportedly 
renewed U.S. demand for freezing a sales tax hike until the 
economy recovers, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Wednesday 
[15 June]. 
  Fujii, speaking at a press meeting, was referring to a 
report 
that U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen made a renewed 
request in a letter. 
  "The basic direction remains unchanged," he said, noting the 
government and ruling parties are at the "final stage" of 
deciding on the tax reform. 
  Japan promised in its March market-opening package to detail 
the tax reform by the end of this month and make it into law by 
the year-end. This came after criticism from the U.S. over a 
6.2 trillion yen tax cut adopted in February for the current 
year only. 
  The aim is to implement multi-year tax cuts, and a 
consumption tax hike not only to offset the tax cuts but also to 
secure funds for welfare in the aging society in the 21st 
century. 
  Fujii neither denied nor confirmed the existence of the 
letter, saying he is in constant contact with the U.S. side to 
exchange views. 
  The two sides have agreed not to comment on these regular 
talks, he added. 
  According to the letter reported by a Japanese daily, 
Bentsen 
called for greater income tax cuts and freezing of the tax hike 
until the Japanese economy recovers clearly. 
  The letter dated Tuesday came on the same day as the 
government's tax commission prepared the basis of its report due 
out next week. 
  The report will include a three-year gap between tax cuts 
and 
hike, and a net revenue surplus. 
  Pressed by reporters about the prospect of winning U.S. 
support, Fujii refrained from commenting directly. 
  The tax issue is a domestic issue but Japan is working on it 
from the standpoint of contributing to the world economy as well 
to coordinate policy with other leading nations, he said. 
  "There are some compromises involved, and we must make 
efforts to win understanding," he said.

  [Text] Fukuoka, June 14 KYODO -- Police Tuesday [14 June] 
recaptured and took into custody three more Chinese suspected of 
being illegal immigrants who fled the Fukuoka Immigration Bureau 
on Sunday. 
  The three are among the 26 Chinese minors who fled the 
bureau 
en masse, of whom a total of 22 have been recaptured, police 
said. The 26, including two girls, were taken into custody on 
may 18 after they were found hiding in a warehouse in Fukuoka, 
western Japan, with more than 100 adult Chinese, who were all 
arrested on suspicion of illegally entering Japan. 
  The immigration officials also found 22,000 yen in cash 
hidden in a cigarette box left on a shelf in one of the 
detention center rooms. The officials suspect the money is what 
is left of the 30,000 yen which one of the Chinese took when 
fleeing the center. 
  A senior immigration official earlier said the escape began 
Sunday evening when one of the Chinese asked for hot water. 
When a bureau official opened the door, 10 Chinese minors 
jumped on him and two other immigration officials, handcuffed 
them and stole about 30,000 yen from a drawer before escaping, 
the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Foreign minister Koji 
Kakizawa reiterated hope Wednesday [15 June] that Japan will 
become a permanent member with veto power on the UN Security 
Council. 
  "When a question arises and Japan cannot accept it at any 
cost, in order to reject it with all its might, it should be no 
problem for Japan to be a permanent member with veto," Kakizawa 
said in answer to questions at a House of Councillors Budget 
Committee session. 
  The minister said Japan should act to reflect views of the 
Asian region and small countries if it wins permanent membership 
with veto power. 
  Japan and Germany are now the only likely candidates for 
permanent seats should the Security Council expand the number 
from the current five, he said. 
  The council now groups Britain, China, France, Russia and 
the 
United States, which have veto power as the major victor nations 
of World War II, and 10 nonpermanent members selected from UN 
member nations for two-year terms. 
  Other countries including Brazil, Egypt, India and Nigeria 
have been named as candidates, but they have failed to win 
majority support among UN members, the minister said. 
  Earlier this month, Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to 
the 
UN, asked a UN panel to discuss reorganization of the Security 
Council given Japan's bid for a permanent seat, but he did not 
mention veto.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 15 KYODO -- A large Japanese 
economic delegation arrived in Yangon Wednesday [15 June] for 
talks with Myanmarese [Burmese] leaders on promotion of 
bilateral trade and Japanese investment. 
  The 50-member delegation led by Kazuo Haruna, chairman of 
Marubeni Corp., represents the powerful Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren). Haruna is vice chairman of the 
federation. 
  During a four-day visit, the mission will confer with Prime 
Minister Gen. Than Shwe and other government and business 
leaders on ways for Japan to help promote the country's 
transition to a market economy, mission members said. 
  The mission members will also discuss Japan's investment in 
Myanmar and expansion of bilateral trade, they said. 
  It is the first visit to Myanmar by a large-scale Japanese 
economic delegation since the 1988 military coup and suppression 
of a democratic movement. 
  The mission includes senior officials of major Japanese 
corporations, including general trading firms, banks, department 
stores and heavy machinery makers. 
  The delegation was welcomed upon arrival by Myanmar 
officials 
led by Brig. Gen. David Abel, minister for national planning and 
economic development.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner said Tuesday [14 Jun] he is not convinced the country's 
economy is rebounding. 
  Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA), distanced himself from bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno, who said Monday the economy has moved "one step 
toward a recovery." 
  "I cannot confidently say the economy has entered a recovery 
phase, although I do feel much better about it," Terasawa said 
at a press conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  He said he will wait before declaring an economic recovery, 
citing capital spending and foreign exchange rates as his main 
concerns. 
  "My concerns will dissapear if capital spending firms up," 
Teresawa said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The government should 
increase its investment in public-sector construction projects 
by an average 7.1 percent every year through fiscal 2000 to 
maintain an annual economic growth rate of 2 to 3.5 percent 
until 2010, a government study group said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  The group, formed by the Construction Ministry to estimate 
mid- and long-term construction investment by the public sector, 
said that spending by the private sector on building plants, 
offices and shops will remain weak until at least fiscal 2000. 
  Private-sector firms are taking time to adjust inventories 
accumulated during the "bubble economy" era of the late 1980's, 
it said, adding public-sector investment will be a key factor to 
sustain Japan's economic growth. It said the 7.1 percent 
desired increase is calculated based on an assumption that Japan 
wants to maintain an annual 3 to 3.5 percent economic growth in 
real terms through the 2000 business year, which ends March 2001. 
  Should Japan want to maintain the economic growth for 10 
years from the 2001 business year at a pace between 2.6 and 2.9 
percent, the government will find it necessary to increase its 
construction investment by an average 2.7 percent every year, 
the group added. The rate can be lower than for earlier years 
because private-sector investment will have recovered by then, 
it said. If the government increased such investment at lower 
paces, the economic growth target will not be sustainable, the 
group added. 
  With public-sector spending on construction projects boosted 
to the recommended rates in those periods, the scale of Japan's 
construction market, including housing, private-sector business 
facilities and public-sector construction projects, will reach 
about 870 trillion yen for the decade through the 2000 business 
year. The scale will then reach to about 1,180 trillion yen for 
the next decade, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- The Japanese economy is 
expected to start recovering from around summer if recent 
positive signs continue to spread and absorb such prevailing 
concerns as the yen's rise, a banking industry leader said 
Tuesday [14 June]. "If things go smoothly, I expect an economic 
recovery will become clear from around summer," Toshio Morikawa, 
chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, 
told a regular news conference. 
  Morikawa joined Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and 
government leaders in painting a brighter picture of the economy 
following last Friday's release of the central bank's quarterly 
"Tankan" business sentiment survey for May. The survey showed 
improved sentiment on a broad front for the first time in five 
years. 
  "The Tankan indicated that the economy is heading toward 
improvement," Morikawa said. Also echoing comments by Mieno and 
government leaders, however, Morikawa remained cautious about 
declaring the economy has hit bottom. "Both positive and 
negative factors still exist," he said, particularly citing such 
risks as the yen's rise, tough labor conditions, and sluggish 
capital investment. 
  As upcoming positive factors, Morikawa said consumers will 
receive at the end of the month the first of two payments from 
the 5.5 trillion yen in income tax cuts, and that Diet passage 
of the fiscal 1994 budget has come into sight. Regarding labor 
problems, Morikawa, expressing his view as president of Sumitomo 
Bank, indicated his opposition to the idea of reducing starting 
salaries to boost recruitment, an idea proposed last week by 
Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers 
Associations (Nikkeiren). "It is difficult for companies to 
increase recruitment when they are restructuring," he said, 
noting that his bank intends to cut back hiring of new graduates 
next spring as part of a plan to reduce the overall workforce. 
Management has already presented the plan to the labor union, 
he said. 
  Asked about the direction of interest rates, Morikawa said 
both short- and long-term rates will remain stable at low levels 
for the time being as the economy is not yet recovering. 
Commenting on a reported plan by the finance ministry to 
deregulate private housing loans, Morikawa said deregulation 
will help "improve user convenience," welcoming the plan and 
brushing aside user concerns that rates will be set higher. He 
said that banks are expected to develop new services to meet 
demand, such as loans with fixed rates amid the current low-rate 
trend. 
  The ministry is reportedly planning to include the 
deregulatory step in a second market-opening package to be 
issued by the end of June.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii vowed Tuesday [14 Jun] to continue taking measures to make 
the recent bright signs in the economy spread but remained 
cautious over the economic outlook, citing currency rate 
directions. 
  "Bright signs are certainly appearing," Fujii told a news 
conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  He was referring to improvements for the first time in five 
years mentioned Friday in the Bank of Japan's quarterly "Tankan" 
survey of business confidence for May. 
  But he refused otherwise to offer his assessment and outlook 
on the economy, saying, "overall assessment is done by the Bank 
of Japan and the Economic Planning Agency." 
  "My job is to pin utmost efforts to put those bright signs 
on 
a steady path," Fujii said, particularly calling for early 
passage of the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  The delayed budget for the current fiscal year that began 
April 1 is under deliberation at the House of Councillors after 
passing the House of Representatives last week. The government 
is now running with a stopgap budget. 
  Concerning the yen's resurgence against the dollar these 
past 
few days, Fujii said the currency rate direction is a problem as 
he and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno have been saying. 
  "We are closely watching the currency rate movements from 
the 
standpoint of the economy," he said. 
  He reiterated that Japan is in close contact with other 
Group 
of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations to cooperate in 
stemming "undesirable volatility" as the G-7 finance ministers 
and central bankers reaffirmed at their April meeting in 
Washington. 
  Mieno told a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting 
Monday that it looks like the economy has moved "one step" 
toward recovery but noted that various uncertainties prevent him 
from describing the economy as having gone "two or three steps 
forward." 
  Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa 
told reporters after the Tuesday cabinet meeting, "I can't say 
yet the economy has turned around although I feel more 
optimistic." 
  Both Mieno and Terasawa cited lingering concern over the 
yen's rise and sluggish corporate capital investment as the 
major factors for the cautiousness.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Wednesday [15 June] expressed his government's determination 
to reform Japan's economic system "drastically." 
  Speaking at the 16th trade conference, Hata said, "the 
reform 
will likely involve pain. But the government's goal of 
upgrading the overall standard of the Japanese people cannot be 
achieved without such efforts," according to an official of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  The conference took place at the prime minister's official 
residence, with foreign businesspeople attending a meeting of 
the highest trade body of the government for the first time. 
  The meeting is designed to receive views and opinions from 
government officials and business leaders on deregulation and 
other market-opening measures announced at the end of March, the 
official told reporters. 
  Horst Kramp, the head of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said most of the trade barriers that afflicted 
foreigners in the past have been successfully removed. 
  But Japan should make further efforts to get rid of 
remaining 
barriers, such as administrative guidance that effectively 
limits foreign business activity and complex business licensing 
procedures, Kramp said, according to the official. 
  James Wogsland, vice chairman of Caterpillar Inc. of the 
United States, urged the Japanese Government to identify and 
remove trade barriers on a sector-by-sector basis. 
  He also demanded that Japan reform its distribution system 
to 
facilitate penetration of imports. 
  Suvit Wanglee, the head of the Board of Trade of Thailand, 
voiced hope the Japanese business community, especially 
corporations operating in Thailand, will cooperate with local 
companies in order to foster Thai industries. 
  "Japan should serve as a locomotive for world economic 
growth," the official quoted Suvit as saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The Japanese economy 
appears to be recovering but further watch is needed to see if 
it can pick up strongly, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno 
said Wednesday [15 June]. 
  "Assessing the most recent statistics, possibility is strong 
that the economy has moved one step forward toward a recovery 
from my recent assessment that it is showing signs of bottoming 
out," Mieno told a regular press meeting in repeating his 
earlier comments. 
  "But we must carefully watch the sustainability and tempo of 
the recovery," he noted, refusing to say the 37-month recession 
has hit a bottom. 
  Indicating uncertainty over the strength of the recovery, 
Mieno stressed that bottom implies a strong V-shaped pickup. 
  Pressed by reporters to comment on downside risks, Mieno 
said 
he could not ignore them, but "I feel the economy is moving in a 
good direction." 
  "That's why I said at the Diet (earlier this week) that a 
further careful watch is needed to judge whether the economy has 
moved two or three steps forward," Mieno said. 
  In his comments on Monday at the House of Councilors Budget 
Committee, the central bank chief described the economy with the 
word "recovery" for the first time since Japan suffered a 
double-dip recession just a year ago after showing signs of 
recovery. 
  The rosier assessment came after his bank's quarterly 
"Tankan" business report for May released Friday with 
improvements on a broad front for the first time in five years. 
  As positive factors indicated by the Tankan, Mieno cited 
improvements in personal consumption, recovery of exports, and 
optimistic projections in industrial output and corporate 
earnings. 
  These bright spots stemmed from progress in inventory 
adjustments and corporate restructuring efforts, and the 
spreading effects of the latest macroeconomic measures, Mieno 
noted. 
  But negative factors also prevail, he said, pointing in 
particular to uncertain currency rates, the still-tough labor 
and capital investment conditions, and increased competition 
with other Asian nations. 
  Mieno declined to comment directly on recent market views 
that the central bank has changed its monetary stance from loose 
to neutral stance in the short-term money market. 
  "Our stance to decide on monetary policy based on the state 
of the economy remains unchanged...And it now is to check 
carefully the tempo and sustainability of the recovery." 
  On the recent rise in long-term market rates, he said 
fluctuations are natural for market rates, and they will return 
to levels reflecting the economic state in the longer run. 
  Considering recent global moves to regulate financial 
derivatives, Mieno said financial authorities should pave the 
way for the private sector to set up its own rules and enhance 
the use of such "effective" risk-hedging tools. 
  The measures include improving statistics and disclosure to 
grasp transactions, he said. 
  Central bankers from major nations shared this view when 
they 
gathered in London last week. 
  Concerns led by the United States are increasing over 
financial derivatives, such as options and swaps, that their 
off-balance transactions may cause unnecessary volatility. 
  In Japan, however, tough regulations exist over such 
advanced 
products, and financial authorities are instead worried about 
losing international position.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
has instructed his senior advisers to help implement an 
information highway which could create a 123 trillion yen market 
and 2.43 million new jobs, government officials said Wednesday 
[15 June]. 
  They said the information highway project calls for setting 
up a nationwide optical fiber network to connect every Japanese 
home by 2010, as recommended in a recent report by an advisory 
panel to the posts and telecommunications minister. 
  Hata told reporters Tuesday night his cabinet hopes to 
establish an in-house research organization because bureaucratic 
red tape has prevented speedy work on the subject. 
  In testimony before the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee on Tuesday night, Hata said he is aware of criticism 
that Japan lags behind the United States and other countries in 
proceeding with its own information highway project. 
  He said he wants the nation's private sector to fully 
participate in the project, which could be a Japanese version of 
the U.S. information superhighway launched by Vice President Al 
Gore. 
  A high-ranking government source said the Hata cabinet plans 
to open the in-house research arm within this month or by early 
July at the latest. 
  Members of the new group will include the prime minister, 
the 
chief cabinet secretary and posts and telecommunications and 
trade ministers, the source said. 
  Hata told reporters on Wednesday morning his administration 
will get advice from the private sector although the new group 
will not have private sector people as members.

told Japanese business leaders Tuesday [14 Jun] his government 
is willing to allow self-service gas stations in Japan on 
certain conditions, as part of deregulation, government 
officials said. 
  Hata was responding to a proposal by Isao Nakauchi, vice 
chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren), that self-service gas stations be introduced in 
Japan. 
  During the meeting at Hata's official residence, Nakauchi 
also asked Hata for his leadership in implementing deregulation. 
  Keidanren executives handed a petition to Hata, asking him 
to 
cut the number of economic regulations in half over the next 
five years, and map out a plan for scrapping and privatizing 
government-backed corporations as well as consolidating 
government departments.

  [Text] HONG KONG, June 15 (AFP) -- North Korea is 
"prepared" for war if the United States keeps pushing for 
inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear program, President Kim 
Il-Song has been quoted as saying. In a meeting June 1 in 
Pyongyang with King Norodom Sihanouk, the North Korean leader 
also said he wanted direct negotiations with Washington to 
tension on the Korean peninsula, according to the Cambodian 
leader. Kim added that North Korea would not start a war with 
South Korea, although it would resist if attacked, Sihanouk told 
the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW in an interview to appear 
Thursday. 
  "The words were not hostile at all," Sihanouk, a close 
friend 
of Kim who maintains a residence in Pyongyang, told the Hong 
Kong-based newsweekly in Beijing. But he quoted Kim as saying 
the United States, by pushing for nuclear inspections, wanted to 
turn North Korea into "a man without defence secrets, just a 
naked man." "We cannot accept that. We would rather accept a 
war. If they decide to make war, we accept the war, the 
challenge we are prepared for," Kim was quoted as saying. "They 
want us to take off our shirts, our coats, and now our trousers 
-- and after that, we will be nude, absolutely naked." 
  North Korea announced this week it was pulling out of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency after resisting attempts by 
the UN agency to determine if it extracted ingredients for a 
nuclear bomb from its small reactor. 
  Sihanouk quoted Kim as saying: "The Americans know perhaps 
that we have no nuclear weapons, but they want to know what is 
exactly our defence system with conventional weapons." "That is 
the reason they want the UN atomic agency to make inspections in 
depth," Kim added. 
  Explaining why he took two weeks to convey Kim's remarks, 
Sihanouk told the REVIEW that the North Korean leader had asked 
him at the time to pass on the remarks to the king's "American 
friends." "But I have had no opportunities to tell (U.S.) 
officials," the monarch said. "No, I don't need to tell the 
officials, as I have been telling you (the REVIEW)."

To Withdraw From IAEA" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Foreign Minister Kim 
Yong-nam sent a notice on June 13 to Warren Christopher, 
secretary of state of the United States of America, the 
depository state of the statute of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], in accordance with paragraph D of Article 
XVIII of the IAEA's statute, informing him of the decision of 
the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to 
immediately withdraw from the IAEA. 
  The notice was correctly conveyed to the permanent mission 
of 
the USA at the United Nations through the permanent mission of 
the DPRK at the U.N. on June 13. 
  With this, the Government of the Democratic People's 
Republic 
of Korea completed all the legal procedures to withdraw from the 
IAEA. 
  The notice sent by Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam to the U.S. 
state secretary says: 
  I wish to remind you that the Secretariat of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA/agency) invoked the 
authority of the agency's Board of Governors to adopt on June 
10, 1994 an unjust board's "resolution," imposing "sanctions" 
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), an 
action that has jeopardized the supreme interests of the DPRK, 
flagrantly encroached upon its sovereign rights and dignity, and 
created such a circumstance which makes it impossible for the 
DPRK to maintain normal relations with the IAEA any longer. 
  The further inspections for the continuity of safeguards we 
have accepted with goodwill despite our unique status based on 
the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our declared 
withdrawal from the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, and the more we have dealt with the agency Secretariat, 
the worse the problem has become rather than be resolved. This 
is the serious lessons and conclusion that we have drawn from 
what we have so far experienced in accepting the agency's 
inspections. 
  All the facts demonstrate that the IAEA Secretariat has 
pursued the dishonest political purposes of stifling the DPRK 
under the pretext of its inspections rather than seek a fair 
resolution of the nuclear issue. 
  With regard to the recent adoption by the agency Secretariat 
of another unjust "resolution" despite our strong opposition and 
warnings, I have been authorized to inform, through you, the 
Government of the United States of America, the depository 
government, that, in accordance with paragraph D of Article 
XVIII of the IAEA's statute, the Government of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea decided to withdraw from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency as of June 13, 1994.

  [Text] In connection with the decision of the DPRK 
Government to immediately withdraw from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam notified on 
13 June U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the trustee 
of the agency's ratification treaty, of this in accordance with 
Clause D of Article 18 of IAEA regulations. 
  The letter of notification was correctly conveyed to the 
U.S. 
permanent mission at the United Nations through the permanent 
mission of the DPRK at the United Nations on 13 June. 
  In this connection, the DPRK Government has completed all 
legal procedures related to its withdrawal from the IAEA. 
  The content of the letter of notification about the 
withdrawal follows: 
  I recall to mind: By adopting an unjust resolution of 
imposing sanctions on us through the convocation of the Board of 
Governors on 10 June 1994, the Secretariat of the IAEA has 
endangered the highest interest of our country; has gravely 
infringed upon the country's sovereignty and dignity; and has 
created a situation in which the normal relations between us and 
the IAEA can no longer be maintained. 
  In a unique status in which we temporarily suspended the 
effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, the more inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of 
safeguards we have undergone with good will and the more 
(?contacts) we have made with the agency's Secretariat, the more 
serious the question has become, far from being resolved. This 
is a serious lesson and a conclusion that we have reached while 
undergoing the agency's inspections up to now. 
  All the facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat does not 
desire 
an aboveboard resolution of the nuclear issue, but is pursuing 
its impure political purpose of crushing [apsal] us under the 
pretext of inspections. 
  The agency's Secretariat has again adopted an unjust 
resolution in spite of our strong opposition and warning. In 
this connection, as authorized, I notify the U.S. Government, 
the trustee country, through you, of the fact that the DPRK 
Government decided to withdraw from the IAEA as of 13 June 1994, 
in accordance with Clause D of Article 18 of the agency's 
regulations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Just Self-Defensive Measure"] </F>
  [Text] The plot of the United States and some quarters of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat to 
isolate and crush our Republic has finally entered a stage of 
reckless actions [mubunbyolhan silchondangyee]. 
  As it has already been reported, the 10 June IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting shamelessly demanded the opening of our 
military sites on the pretext of the nuclear issue and adopted 
an extremely unreasonable resolution on the suspension of the 
agency's assistance to our country. 
  Regarding this, the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a 
statement protesting the IAEA Secretariat's unreasonable 
resolution, announcing our withdrawal from the IAEA, clearing 
that inspections for the continuity of safeguards which we have 
accepted in our unique status will no longer be allowed, and 
reaffirming that UN sanctions will be regarded immediately as a 
declaration of war. 
  Our withdrawal from the IAEA is, by all means, a just 
measure 
to protect the nation's dignity and sovereignty. As everyone 
knows, we joined the IAEA to strengthen international 
cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities and to further 
develop our independent nuclear power industry, not to receive 
somebody's pressure or sanctions while be bound by the agency. 
  However, some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat who kowtows 
to 
the U.S. policy of crushing the Republic laid from the beginning 
obstacles and difficulties in the way of resolving the issue by 
creating nonexistent inconsistency [purilchi]. By doing so, 
they compelled us to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] [urirohayogum haengmugijonpabangjijoyakeso 
taltoehagi anumyon andoege mandueosumnida]. 
  Furthermore, they have led the situation to the extent they 
will finally impose sanctions, not satisfied with making demands 
on allowing inspections not for guaranteeing the continuity of 
safeguards in our special status following the temporary 
suspension of our withdrawal from the NPT but tantamount to 
routine and ad hoc inspections [chongimit pijonggi sachal]. 
  The more we receive inspections from the agency, the more 
pressure and difficulties are imposed on us and our Republic's 
security and sovereignty are threatened. 
  All these are clear proofs that the United States and the 
agency's Secretariat are attempting to encroach upon our 
sovereignty and to crush us by using the leverage of inspection 
[sachariranun kongganul]. Under such condition, is there any 
reason for us, who regard sovereignty as our life line, to 
remain in the agency and receive unreasonable pressure, having 
the nation's dignity and sovereignty infringed upon? Likewise, 
how can we promote international cooperation in the realm of 
nuclear activities and develop our nuclear power industry 
independently when the agency arbitrarily tyrannizes 
[chonhoeingul pursinugo] over its member nations by standing on 
their heads and serves as a maid of the United States, losing 
its impartiality and principles of democracy? 
  Our decision to withdraw from the IAEA is a just 
self-defensive measure against the agency which is scheming 
outrageously to impose unreasonable sanctions against us and to 
penetrate into our military sites. The IAEA Secretariat's 
recent adoption of a resolution on us is an unpardonable act 
that gravely encroaches upon our Republic's dignity and 
sovereignty, and is an intolerable insult to our people. 
  With the adoption of an unreasonable resolution, the IAEA 
Secretariat has failed to perform its mission as an 
international organization and openly joined hands with the 
imperialist forces who attempt to crush our socialist system. 
By doing so, the IAEA Secretariat, as a stooge of the 
imperialists, resulted in smearing ink on its face with its own 
hands by weakening its credit in international community. 
  The agency's sanctions against us is, in essence, a prelude 
to a UN resolution. We have clearly affirmed that the UN 
resolution will be regarded as a declaration of war. No 
pressure nor threat will get through on us. Pressure and threat 
will in fact strengthen our will and conviction all the more. 
  Our people will resolutely deal with it in case any 
unreasonable sanctions are imposed on us in the wake of the 
unreasonable resolution the IAEA Secretariat recently adopted.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea, Sunday met and had a friendly talk with the delegation of 
the Japan-Korea Friendship Exchange Association of Agricultural 
Farmers headed by Masao Yoshida, former Social-Democratic member

he witnessed the achievements made by the Korean people in 
socialist construction under the banner of the chuche idea, 
closely rallied around the great leader His Excellency President 
Kim Il-song and the dear leader His Excellency Kim Chong-il. 
  Noting that Korea has made great achievements in agriculture

looks of farmers of the northern half of Korea engaged in 
farming even in areas near the Military Demarcation Line. 
  He said he got a good knowledge of the progress of socialist 
construction in Korea, seeing the splendid apartment houses of 
Tongil street built under the wise guidance of the dear leader 
His Excellency Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, has 
urged the UN Security Council to leave the way open for North 
Korea to change its mind over international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities. While reaffirming Australia's willingness 
to abide by any decision the Security Council might take on 
sanctions, Senator Evans said in Manila that the situation would 
have to be handled delicately. Trevor Watson reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Watson] Senator Evans said he would 
deplore any decision that drove the North Koreans beyond the 
point of no return in their dealings with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency or the world community. Nobody, he says, 
knows if sanctions will do that or encourage the North to be 
more open in the future. 
  [Evans] Will it serve the purpose for keeping them committed 
in the future and to ensure that we at least know there won't be 
diversion of nuclear material in the future, or will it be the 
trigger which in fact pushes them over the brink to walk away 
from the Nonproliferation Treaty altogether? [end recording]

  [Text] In answering an AFP correspondent inquiring about 
Vietnam's reaction on the IAEA's [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] decision to pose punitive sanctions on the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, a spokesman of our Foreign Ministry 
on 14 June said: 
  Vietnam follows with deep concern recent developments of the 
nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. We believe that all 
members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, have 
similar obligations in the nuclear issue. We are always 
persistent in our belief that the solution for this complicated 
issue can only be reached through resolute and serious 
negotiations between the parties concerned on the basis of 
equality and respect to each other's independence and 
sovereignty and to international laws. 
  All actions at variance with that direction will only worsen 
the already complicated situation, and will harm the trend of 
peace, stability, and cooperation for the Pacific region which 
all countries in the region are striving to maintain.

<F P=106> [Romain Franklin report: "Pyongyang Confirms Withdrawal </F>
From IAEA"] 
  [Text] Pak Tong-chun, the representative of the general 
delegation of North Korea in France, confirmed yesterday to 
LIBERATION that his country had withdrawn from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and that the United States, which is 
the depositary for the ratification instruments of the signatory 
states, had been officially notified of this on Monday, 13 June, 
in accordance with the required procedure. Nevertheless, North 
Korea is still a member of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
On the other hand, "if sanctions are decided by the United 
Nations," Mr. Pak said, North Korea "would no longer have any 
reason to stay in the NPT" and "will declare war on all those 
who seek to align themselves with the American strategy aimed at 
strangling our Republic," which, he continued, "can no longer 
tolerate attacks on its sovereignty." 
  The North Korean representative also asserted that the 
United 
States accepted the principle of a withdrawal of its military 
forces from South Korea (37,000 men) within the framework of a 
"secret" bilateral agreement concluded between the two countries 
in New York in December 1993 and signed in February. Pak did 
not provide any evidence of this, however. "The United States 
asked us not to divulge this, but since then it has reneged on 
all its promises," he continued. 
  A State Department spokesman responsible for Korean affairs 
contacted in Washington refused to comment on these allegations. 
He did confirm, however, that a "broad, comprehensive approach" 
was the "goal of the talks held between North Korea and the 
United States." According to him, Washington agreed, among other 
things, to provide "a guarantee of the non-use of nuclear arms 
on the Korean peninsula and diplomatic recognition" of the 
Pyongyang regime. In exchange, Pak said, Pyongyang "will return 
to the NPT and will once again authorize ad hoc IAEA 
inspections." 
  "If the negotiations between North Korea and Washington had 
carried on as we requested, the whole problem would have been 
resolved," Pak said. However, the United States repeated on 
Monday that direct negotiations with Pyongyang would only be 
possible if North Korea "regularized its situation with the 
IAEA." 
  The United States is preparing to submit a preliminary draft 
resolution to the United Nations aimed at imposing "phased" 
sanctions. This process will require "a certain amount of 
time," Washington said. It might take even longer since Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin said Tuesday that he wanted to make any 
"phased" sanctions "dependent" on the holding of a international 
conference on Korea. President Clinton does not want this 
proposed conference to become an "obstacle" to the imposing of 
sanctions.

  [Text] The Chinese Government has released an official 
statement that it is watching developments regarding North 
Korea's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. 
  In an explanation of its government's position released 15 
hours after North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, 
the Chinese Foreign Ministry disclosed that North Korea did not 
officially notify the Chinese Government, stressing that it is 
watching with deep interest developments related to North 
Korea's nuclear issue. Such a comment by the Chinese Government 
hints that North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA 
without prior consultations with the Chinese and that China is 
failing to establish a diplomatic response. 
  China's XINHUA News Agency only carried a brief report on 
North Korea's statement 14 hours after Pyongyang issued the 
statement, quoting North Korea's NODONG SINMUN.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 (YONHAP) -- In the wake of North 
Korea's abrupt decision to quit the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), hawkish voices are growing louder in the Japanese 
Government calling for the United Nations Security Council 
[UNSC] to adopt a resolution on immediate, rather than gradual, 
economic sanctions against North Korea, a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said Wednesday. 
  The official said, "Japan had demanded that the UNSC adopt a 
warning resolution first before monitoring the situation and 
passing a sanctions resolution against North Korea. But now 
that North Korea has withdrawn from the IAEA, Japan does not 
have any ground for proposing milder and gradual steps by the 
international community." 
  At a recent meeting with South Korea and the United States, 
Japan had proposed that the Security Council adopt a warning 
resolution first before taking the second step of imposing 
relatively mild economic sanctions. Under this proposal, if 
North Korea did not accept IAEA inspections despite the U.N. 
measures, the council would take strong action including 
suspension of trade and remittances from Koreans residing in 
Japan. 
  But with the Stalinist state's withdrawal from the IAEA, the 
Security Council may adopt a strong sanctions resolution from 
the outset that includes suspension of remittances by 
pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan to North Korea, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government may send Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa to the United States late this month to discuss 
future measures after a U.N. resolution is adopted, as the 
tension on the Korean peninsula continues to rise. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata talked with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton over the telephone Tuesday, promising 
that Japan will cooperate with the Security Council within the 
limits of its Constitution if sanctions are slapped on North 
Korea.

<F P=106> [By Vijayan Menon, Chan Cheng Tuan and Esther Tan] </F>
  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Fri -- The Barisan Nasional [BN] 
Supreme Council today unanimously accepted Parti Demokratik 
Sabah, [PDS] [Sabah Democratic Party] and Parti Bersatu Rakyat 
Sabah [PBRS] [Sabah United People's Party] into the coalition. 
  PBRS, launched on March 15, is headed by former PBS [Party 
Bersatu Sabah -- Sabah United Party] secretary-general Datuk 
Joseph Kurup while PDS is headed by former PBS deputy president 
and Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Bernard Dompok. 
  The PDS has 12 Assemblymen and four MPs while Kurup is the 
only Assemblyman in the PBRS. 
  With their entry, the ruling coalition has 49 State 
Assemblymen in the 54-seat house. Apart from the 13 from PDS 
and PBRS, UMNO [United Malays National Organization] has 22, 
Sabah Progressive Party (six), Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat [Akar] 
[People's Justice Organization] (six) and the Liberal Democratic 
Party (two). The PBS, in Opposition, has five Assemblymen. BN 
chairman and Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said 
the council considered applications from three parties to become 
components of the coalition. 
  "After discussing at length, we unanimously decided to 
accept 
the PDS and the PBRS but rejected the application of Parti Setia 
[Loyalty Party]," he told reporters after chairing an hour-long 
meeting of the BN Supreme Council at the UMNO headquarters in 
the Putra World Trade Center here. 
  Parti Setia, headed by Suhaidin Langkap, was formed in 
October last year and it contested 15 seats in the Sabah State 
elections but faired miserably with nearly all the candidates 
losing their deposits. 
  Asked whether any conditions were attached to the acceptance 
of the two parties, Dr. Mahathir said there were none and they 
were accepted as full members. 
  Earlier, Dr. Mahathir said the UMNO supreme council had also 
made its stand on the applications by the PBRS and PDS to join 
the BN. 
  On whether the council discussed the appointment of a Sabah 
deputy chief minister, he replied: "This is not the 
responsibility of the BN Supreme Council. 
  "It is up to me to decide on the post and other vacant 
positions in consultation with the Sabah chief minister," he 
said. 
  Asked whether the acceptance of the two parties would cause 
problems as there were other Sabah BN parties which had 
expressed reservations on the inclusion of the two, he said: 
  "The decision was unanimous... as such we do not think there 
will be any problem." On the objection of Akar, he said Akar, 
like the other two component parties, gave their views. 
  "After we listened to all their views we made the decision 
and everyone agreed." 
  Asked whether this would further consolidate the coalition's 
strength in Sabah, he said it would become stronger. 
  Questioned on whether this would encourage the call for an 
early general election, he laughed and quipped: "There are so 
many encouraging signs that even I am confused." 
  On whether the council discussed the general election, Dr. 
Mahathir said, there were questions about the election. 
  "I explained about the elections ... how to hold elections, 
what needs to be organised, election machinery and co-operation 
among the component parties." 
  On whether there was a possibility of a general election 
being held this year, he replied: "Maybe. Perhaps next year."

  [Excerpt] Johor Baharu, 18 May -- Illegal fishing 
activities in Malaysian waters by Vietnamese fishermen who are 
former military personnel well trained in warfare are posing a 
new threat to the country. This follows the discovery of a 
rocket-launcher and several automatic rifles in two Vietnamese 
fishing trawlers detained in Terengganu recently. 
  Abdul Hamid Syukor, chairman of the Marine Division of the 
Fishery Department said that from the national security 
viewpoint, the discovery of the weapons is serious and at the 
same time a danger to the country's maritime officials. "Even 
though there were no clashes when the weapons were seized, the 
seizure was something serious because these Vietnamese were well 
trained in using war weapons," he said to reporters after 
visiting the marine fishery center here. Therefore, maritime 
officers have been instructed to conduct thorough examinations 
on Vietnamese trawlers involved in illegal fishing in the area. 
  Abdul Hamid said the trawlers were found during the 
incidents 
on 4 and 7 March to be armed with one rocket-launcher, one light 
machine gun, two M-16 rifles, and two AK-47 rifles, as well as 
eight ammunition magazines, 13 rounds of 40mm ammunition, and 
485 rounds of ammunition. He added the two trawlers had been 
detained by two Royal Malaysian Navy patrol boats at 150 
nautical miles in Pahang waters early in the morning. [passage

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 15 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
has asked the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to 
assist in its joint move with Denmark to draw up an 
international regulation to curb dumping of toxic chemicals in 
developing countries. 
  Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding 
said Tuesday, he made the request to UNEP Under 
Secretary-General Elizabeth Dowdeswell since UNEP had been an 
active and strong supporter of international chemical safety 
programmes. 
  Dowdeswell was also briefed on the discussion I had with 
Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken, Law told reporters 
after receiving Dowdeswell, who is on a two-day official visit 
here. 
  Monday, Malaysia and Denmark agreed to work together in 
formulating an international regulation to control the 
trafficking of banned and restricted chemicals like DDT 
[dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane] from industrialised nations 
to developing countries. 
  Law said during their one-hour meeting, they also discussed 
a 
wide range of subjects, among them, the role of UNEP in the 
restructuring of the global environmental facilities, where he 
hoped UNEP could play a much bigger role. 
  He said they also discussed Agenda 21, the world's action 
plan to protect the environment. 
  Malaysia also suggested a possible dialogue among Southeast 
Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand on environment 
matters. 
  Dowdeswell, who is on her first visit here, said the UNEP 
was 
very keen to work with Malaysia and Denmark on enforcing the ban 
on toxic chemicals dumping since UNEP had been promoting 
chemical safety.

<F P=106> [Article by Tsutomu Yamaguchi from Washington; part one of </F>
three-part series entitled "North Korea's Suspected Development 
of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure: The United States Is 
Becoming Restless at the Stalemate"; first paragraph is YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
development of nuclear arms has suddenly been launched into even 
greater confusion with the DPRK's unexpected replacement of fuel 
rods from its experimental nuclear reactor. The focal issue 
will now be what will come out of multilateral discussions at 
the UN Security Council, apart from how North Korea, which 
maintains a confrontational attitude toward the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime led by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), will behave from now on. Will the UN discussions 
lead to a breakthrough in the situation or will they lead to an 
even more dangerous direction? Let us look at the structure of 
this crisis, including how Japan is coping with the situation. 
  "Since June last year, we have carried on negotiations with 
the DPRK, with patience and flexibility. But the question was 
returned to the UN Security Council because the DPRK had 
destroyed the basis for the IAEA to determine how much plutonium 
had been diverted." On 3 June, the IAEA reported to the UN 
secretary general that the inspection of the fuel rods became 
impossible. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci 
(special envoy on North Korean nuclear matters) held a news 
conference and his face reflected fatigue and disappointment. 
He was on record only a week ago making public a prospect that 
the third-round of high level talks with the DPRK might be held 
in early June. It was going to be a successful overcoming of 
domestic hawks' criticism of "appeasement." 
  At that third-round of talks, the assistant secretary of 
state said both countries were scheduled "to talk over the total 
settlement of the nuclear problem and the problems related to 
normalization of relations between the two countries." Was it 
not what the DPRK nuclear diplomacy intended -- bringing the 
U.S. Government to the negotiating table by declaring its 
intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] in March last year? 
  At this vital time, why did the DPRK dare to remove fuel 
rods 
from a reactor? Although what had happened behind the scenes 
was shrouded in mystery, the assistant secretary of state's 
words sounded as though he was greatly mortified. Well-informed 
people in the United States are now divided into two groups in 
their interpretation of the suspected DPRK nuclear arms 
development program with which the DPRK has been playing with 
the United States, a super power. One is the nuclear card theory 
that the DPRK is using the suspicion itself as an allurement to 
win the largest possible compromise out of the West. Another is 
an argument that the DPRK is attempting to establish military 
predominance in the region and to get economic as well as 
diplomatic compromises by eventually possessing a nuclear 
capability. 
  The six policy options mentioned in a report titled "The 
North Korean Nuclear Program and U.S. Government Policy Options" 
published on 1 June by the Congressional Research Service 
strongly reflect polarization of views on the DPRK. While the 
first option says to await the collapse of the Pyongyang regime, 
which cannot survive until the DPRK's nuclear capability becomes 
a serious threat, the second option suggests a policy of making 
a package settlement of the problems pertaining to the Korean 
peninsula and it has become the basis of the foreign policy the 
Clinton administration has pursued so far. 
  The third option is about the UN-imposed economic sanctions 
now under hot debate. These sanctions are anticipated when 
diplomatic efforts mentioned in the second option fail. 
  The remaining choices are related to military options: the 
fourth suggests reinforcement of the U.S. military presence in 
the Korean peninsula, including redeployment of tactical nuclear 
weapons and the fifth contains a tough proposal to launch 
limited attacks on the suspected nuclear facilities. The fifth 
was exactly what hawkish Republican Senator John McCain had 
proposed in a letter to the President late last month. It may 
be difficult to get the support of Japan and the Republic of 
Korea, who do not in earnest wish to intensify tension in the 
Korean peninsula situation, for the fourth and fifth options. 
  As a result, the report insists on a sixth option, a gradual 
withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK. It amounts to an 
abandonment of mission and the East Asian stability centered 
around the Korean peninsula will be greatly harmed. 
  The congressional report that dared to mention "abandonment" 
as the last option most eloquently reflects the irritation and 
the state of running out in countermeasures on the U.S. 
Government's part. 
  Now the situation is heading toward the third option -- UN 
imposed sanctions, but President Clinton on his European tour 
said: "There is still time to avoid UN sanctions," indicating 
his wish to avoid stepping into the unpredictable next phase. 
  Since its start, the Clinton administration has pursued 
diplomacy based on three pillars -- human rights, economic 
security, and nuclear nonproliferation. But, the human rights 
diplomacy suffered a big setback by extending the 
most-favored-nation treatment to China and economic security has 
not yielded any conspicuous success. For Clinton's diplomacy, 
the last fortress is nuclear nonproliferation for which a talk 
is scheduled next spring to negotiate whether the NPT should be 
reexamined or unconditionally extended. 
  There is no guarantee that the DPRK would make a compromise, 
even if the U.S. Government succeeded in getting support on 
imposing the UN sanctions. It will not be long before President 
Clinton has to make a painful decision whether to defend the 
last fortress or to pull back.

<F P=106> [Article by Takushi Kawada from Seoul; part two of </F>
three-part series entitled "North Korea's Suspected Development 
of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure: Involvement of the 
United States, China, Russia, and Japan Deepens"] 
  [TEXT] On 6 June, the United States, the Republic of 
Korea, and Japan conferred in Washington on the DPRK's nuclear 
question, and an old general abruptly left Pyongyang for 
Beijing. He is 75-year-old Choe Kwang, chief of the general 
staff of the People's Army and a member of the party Politburo. 
During World War II, he was said to have engaged in partisan 
resistance activities with President Kim Il-song and at present 
he ranks ninth in the hierarchy. Choe immediately went into 
talks with his Chinese counterpart and extolled "friendship 
between China and the DPRK." 
  In the evening of 7 June, the following day, ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam deplaned at a military air base in Seoul after an 
official visit of Russia and read a statement: "Russia pledged 
resolute measures to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear 
arms." 
  Only in the Korean peninsula does serious confrontation 
continue after the end of the Cold War. As suspicion over the 
nuclear arms development program is getting more serious, brisk 
activities are going on in the four neighboring [word as 
published] countries -- the United States, China, Russia, and 
Japan. Both South and North Korea are all out to work on China 
and Russia and heated behind-the-scenes negotiations are going 
on at such organizations as the UN Security Council. On 8 June, 
ROK Foreign Minister Han Song-ju will arrive in Beijing and 
Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa will visit Seoul and Beijing 
over the weekend. 
  "The Korea peninsula has once more become an arena of 
rivalry 
among the peripheral four powers. South and North Korea joined 
the United Nations simultaneously three years ago, pledging 
coexistence in their basic agreement, but the nuclear problem 
has completely changed the picture." So said with a sigh North 
Korean affairs specialist Kim Nam-shik, fellow at the Peace 
Study Institute in Seoul, comparing the present situation with 
that of the Yi Dynasty. 
  In the later 19th century, the Korea peninsula, China, 
Czarist Russia, and Japan were rivals for rights and interests 
and Japan colonized Korea after the Sino-Japanese and the 
Russo-Japanese wars. It is needless to say the present situation 
is different from that of those days when imperialism was 
rampant. But fellow Kim pointed out: "Although what matters 
today is nuclear, not the territory, the resembling situation is 
that the peripheral powers are stepping up their influence over 
the Korean peninsula for their own security and interests." 
  As the forefront of East-West confrontation during the Cold 
War days, the Korean peninsula maintained a confrontational but 
stabilized situation in two distinct camps -- North Korea 
supported by China and the Soviet Union and South Korea with the 
backing of the United States and Japan. 
  Following the Cold War's end, the ROK normalized relations 
with the former Soviet Union and China, tipping the power 
balance over the Korean peninsula in one breath. 
  At one time, the South and North sought to construct a 
unique 
order of coexistence but the DPRK finally chose a way to use the 
suspected nuclear arms development program as the means to get a 
U.S. guarantee indispensable "for the maintenance of the present 
order on equal terms." As a result, the United States was 
compelled to further its involvement in the Korean peninsula and 
China, Russia, and Japan became strongly concerned due to 
further complication of the nuclear matters. 
  From this viewpoint, the situation in the Korean peninsula 
can be described as a grandiose diplomatic war between the South 
and North and the Big Four to build a new order of stability in 
the peninsula with the nuclear problem as their keyword. 
  The United States is steadily making preparations for when 
sanctions may be imposed with the cooperation of Japan and the 
ROK with a proposition of "nuclear nonproliferation." But the 
positive fact that must not be overlooked is that none of the 
parties, South and North Korea, the United States, China, 
Russia, or Japan, want sanctions imposed. It is their true 
intention to evade the situation that goes against building a 
new order. 
  According to diplomatic sources, the present position of the 
United States, the ROK, and Japan that they would "impose 
sanctions if necessary" is a policy to apply pressure on the 
DPRK to become more flexible and it is thought to be a 
considerably long time before actual sanctions would take place. 
How are South and North Korea and the four other nations going 
to deal with the dangerous factor of nuclear problems and of 
building a new stability? The DPRK will not easily abandon the 
nuclear card unless it is confident of its survival. 
  Well-informed sources in North Korean affairs predicted the 
future development this way: "DPRK President Kim Il-song is not 
embarrassed at all. Rather, he is indignant with the United 
States for the `nonfulfillment of promises.' There is a good 
reason to believe that the Pyongyang leadership will look for a 
new logic to make compromises on the nuclear inspection and 
shift its position for dialogue, while consolidating readiness 
to undergo preliminary sanctions. On the other hand, it is 
conceivable that it may seek a new solution through the octonary 
negotiation [as proposed by Russia]." They added, "The current 
situation is different from ideological confrontation during the 
Cold War. It poses another problem that crisis may be amplified 
by complex interests of the countries involved."

  [Text] In response to the DPRK (North Korea) announcement 
on its immediate withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), a government source said on 14 June that the 
government had begun to review its stance toward UN Security 
Council [UNSC] resolutions. The Japanese Government has been 
taking a moderate attitude toward North Korea, calling for a 
UNSC warning before imposing any sanctions. However, some 
quarters in the government are calling for stronger actions to 
cope with North Korea's high-handed attitude. The government 
has reportedly started consulting the United States and the ROK 
to jointly urge the UNSC to adopt immediate sanctions. 
  On the same day, a top Foreign Ministry official hinted at a 
change in Japan's stance toward UNSC resolutions, saying: 
"Japan has been calling for step-by-step sanctions beginning 
with a warning by the UNSC, but this does not mean Japan wants 
to disturb the efforts of the international community." In 
addition, a Foreign Ministry source said stronger sanctions are 
likely to be imposed: "The UNSC may include Japan's ban on 
remittances to North Korea from the first stage." In that case, 
the government will face a difficult situation since the 
remittance ban is expected to arouse much controversy in Japan. 
  To cope with the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan, the 
United States, and the ROK held working-level talks in 
Washington on 4 June. Moreover, U.S. Under Secretary of State 
for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff visited Japan and the ROK 
from 10 to 11 June to finalize a motion to be submitted to the 
UNSC. 
  The Japanese Government has been insisting that UNSC 
sanctions be implemented moderately on a step-by-step basis, 
since impatient measures would obtain support from neither China 
nor the Japanese public. In line with the moderate policy, 
Japan requested the UNSC issue a warning against North Korea 
prior to imposing sanctions. 
  The United States and the ROK initially showed consideration 
for Japan's position, and agreed to jointly seek step-by-step 
sanctions. Yet the two nations then showed slightly different 
positions, calling for a UNSC decision on suspension of 
technological aid and cultural exchanges by the United Nations, 
rather than bans on remittances or oil exports. 
  Following North Korea's announcement of its immediate 
withdrawal from the IAEA, the United States and the ROK have 
assumed a firm attitude. In a phone call with Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa on the morning of 14 June, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher hinted at a U.S. policy to strengthen the 
UNSC resolution, saying: "We may have to reconsider our proposal 
to the UNSC."

Koji Kakizawa said at the 14 June House of Councilors' Budget

  [Text] At the upper house Budget Committee session on 14 
June, Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda expressed a 
positive stance toward introduction of the Theater Missile 
Defense (TMD) System. 
  In response to questions by Councillors Taizo Nozawa and 
Fumio Saito on Japan's defense system to counter threats from 
the DPRK's (North Korea) "Nodong-1" missiles, Kanda said: "We 
do not presently have an adequate defense system. We must have 
some sort of large-scale air defense system, such as the TMD." 
  The United States is planning to develop the TMD with the 
participation of Japan and other nations; and, at the Japan-U.S. 
security talks in March, foreign and defense ministers of the 
two nations agreed to "continue talks" on whether Japan should 
join the project. However, the Japanese Government has not so 
far determined its official policy on the project.

  [Text] Commenting on the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor 
Agreement that is due to be reviewed at the end of July, a 
senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] said on 13 June, "The Japanese Government will 
not seek to repeal the agreement." His comment made clear that 
the Japanese Government plans to keep the agreement in effect 
without review until the end of July 1996. Japan and the United 
States are set to hold regular talks on the agreement for two 
days beginning 15 June in Tokyo. 
  The agreement, which was concluded between Japan and the 
United States in August 1991, is effective for five years. The 
agreement carries a provision that requires the two countries to 
"review whether to repeal it or not" at the end of July 1994. 
The agreement sets a 20 percent share of foreign-made 
semiconductors in the Japanese chip market as the target of 
effort. Japan has deeply repented concluding the agreement with 
the United States, claiming that the target of effort has been 
exploited by the United States as a numerical target. 
  For that reason, Japan has long thought of insisting on an 
early repeal of the agreement, but there is a strong view within 
MITI that, with the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
just resumed, "Japan cannot argue with the United States over 
another sticky trade issue." 
  Though the Japanese Government has decided to keep the 
agreement in effect, the same senior MITI official made it clear 
that the Japanese Government will seek to repeal the agreement 
at the end of July 1996 when it expires, saying, "The agreement 
will not be extended after the end of July 1996."

  [Text] A team, which includes Governor Ota, that is 
visiting the United States to demand a resolution on the issues 
of bases in Okinawa ended its activities in Hawaii on the 
morning of 12 June (at dawn on 13 June, Japan time) and is 
heading for the U.S. mainland. The team extracted from the 
commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii a partial 
abolishment of the training across Okinawa Prefecture's Route 
104. On the issue of the naval port in Naha, rough going was 
indicated for specifying a place to move it. The team is facing 
bright prospects and thick walls. The stage for negotiations is 
moving to Washington, where attention is focusing on whether the 
team will be able to gain concrete answers from the State and 
Defense Departments and whether its members will be able to gain 
support from Congress. 
  The U.S. Military has continually emphasized its 
contribution 
to the security of Asia and its consideration for the lives of 
residents. The team does not wish to interpret as lip service 
the declaration of former Marine Commandant Stackpole, attached 
to the Pacific Fleet at Okinawa, that there would be a partial 
abolition of training across Route 104. 
  Whether the "partial abolition" of training becomes a step 
to 
the total abolition of the training that crosses Route 104 and 
whether it will become linked to an abolition of gun platforms 
near residential areas, self-control over their use, and a 
decrease in the frequency of training are all specific points 
that need to be ascertained through talks with high-ranking 
government officials. 
  Concerning the reversion of the naval port in Naha, while it 
has become a formal topic for the Japan-U.S. joint committee, 
the team's having received the explanation that the endeavor is 
facing difficulties shows that one cannot view with optimism the 
governor's negotiations in Washington. 
  The team visiting the United States has three important 
proposals, including the return of Yomitan Airfield. The team 
will also ask for items on which Japan and the United States 
have not yet agreed: Futenma Airfield, the Okuma Recreation 
Center, and the return and/or reduction of water and air areas. 
Their diplomatic skill will be called into question on whether 
a hole can be opened in the thick walls of the U.S. side. 
  The group learned from the Hawaiian State Government the 
details on how the Kahorawe [name as received] Island training 
ground used for live-firing exercises by the U.S. Navy and 
Marines and in Rimpac exercises was returned through the union 
of the residents' movement, the state government, and the 
state's congressmen. On the basis of special U.S. Congress 
legislation, the state and the military authorities reportedly 
agreed on a plan to dispose of unexploded bombs and use the 
site. The legislation now before the Diet for the transfer of 
specified facilities from the military appears realistic. From 
the record of Kahorawe's return, Governor Ota's team obtained 
information for promoting the future return of the bases and use 
of the sites.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hope for Progress in Issues Related to Military </F>
Bases"] 
  [Text] In postwar Okinawa, there have been two cases in 
which the Okinawan people put up a united front in a "people's 
struggle." Needless to say, one of these was the struggle for 
the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese rule, and the other was the 
"struggle for land." The first struggle came to a successful 
conclusion for the most part on 15 May 1972. However, the 
second struggle has yet to end, strictly speaking. Today, U.S. 
military bases which occupy a large portion of the land on 
Okinawa still continue to suppress and hamper the livelihood of 
the Okinawan people and impede Okinawa's reconstruction and 
development projects as well as its future, even though 23 years 
have already passed since reversion. 
  Recently, however, it is heartening to see new moves toward 
settling Okinawa's land problems. 
  One such move is the fact that the United States, which is 
the most important of the parties concerned in the land issue, 
has started inspecting, evaluating, and considering the issue. 
Taking into consideration the changes in the international 
political situation and the military scene due to the collapse 
of the Cold War structure, it is only natural that the United 
States has decided to review the matter. 
  Another move is one that has been brought about by the 
collapse of the political structure in which the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] continuously held on to power since 1955, 
changes in the domestic political situation, and changes in the 
government's attitude regarding the issue of military bases on 
Okinawa. 
  Politicians from different parties are also moving toward 
helping enact a bill on special measures for promoting the use 
of land currently occupied by military bases, upon their return. 
  Finally, let us not overlook the fact that the local chapter 
of the LDP has revised its policy regarding military bases. 
  In the past, it seemed that military base issues were a 
specialty of the local reformist forces. Local conservative 
parties, including the local chapter of the LDP, appeared to be 
passive about military base issues, entrapped in the framework 
of the Japan-U.S. security arrangement upheld by the LDP, which 
dominated national politics. However, the local conservatives 
bid farewell to their past at the local LDP chapter's convention 
held on 10 June. They spelled out a local-interests-oriented 
platform, asserting that "a new economic system and a 
reconstruction of the social structure is being sought," and 
that "progress has not been made despite efforts to reduce 
excessive reliance on military bases by calling for their 
consolidation and retrenchment." 
  As the history of postwar "people's struggles" show, the 
only 
time that the Okinawan people emerged victorious was when they 
were able to put up a united front. Among the problems that 
Okinawa faced were the struggle for reversion and the struggle 
to uphold the four principles regarding safeguarding the 
Okinawan people's land. Such problems were basically related to 
domestic policies and foreign affairs. Okinawans were up 
against the United States as well as their own home country. 
Against such a solid wall, the greatest power that could pierce 
an opening in this wall toward solving these problems is their 
unity and determination. As former U.S. Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger has written in his book, the strength and 
determination of the local people can change both foreign and 
national policies. 
  Currently, Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota is visiting the 
United States in a bid to resolve such issues related to 
military bases as the return of the naval port in Naha, return 
of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and suspension of live-shell 
firing exercises across prefectural route 104. On 10 June, Ota 
met with Hawaii Governor John Waihee and held a news conference 
with U.S. reporters, during which he explained the situation of 
U.S. military bases on Okinawa and tried to gain understanding 
on the purpose of his U.S. visit. During the same news 
conference, U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie, who is a 
member of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, 
disclosed that a provision for a total review of U.S. military 
bases on Okinawa has been included in a bill calling for a 
review of national defense for fiscal year 1995. The bill was 
recently approved by the House Armed Services Committee. The 
representative reportedly has also said: "Firm demands by 
Governor Ota are necessary so that the United States will 
actually conduct a total review of its military bases on 
Okinawa." It is hoped that with the Okinawan people firmly 
backing him up, the governor can turn his U.S. visit and his 
efforts at "direct diplomacy" into a tremendously fruitful 
mission. 
  Although it may be a little early at this stage, groundwork 
should eventually be laid down to handle matters in the event 
the land occupied by military bases are turned over. In this 
regard, it is urged that a law on special measures for promoting 
diversion of military-occupied land be enacted during the 
current Diet session by all means.

  [Text] Kin -- Yoshimoto Masanori, lieutenant governor of 
the Okinawa Prefectural Government, observed a live-firing 
exercise conducted by the U.S. Marine Corps on Okinawa across 
Prefectural Highway No. 104 on the morning of 14 June. The 
live-firing exercise was the fifth such exercise since the 
beginning of this year. During his observation, the lieutenant 
governor surveyed how the highway was blockaded during the 
live-firing exercise and how the exercise affected the lives of 
residents. This is the first time that the lieutenant governor 
has observed an exercise since taking office. Meanwhile, a rally 
was staged to protest the live-firing exercise in Kodai, Igei 
District, under the auspices of the Okinawa Peace Movement 
Center. Rally participants blocked about 70 armed U.S. Marines 
trying to march through the rally, sparking a brief jostle 
between the Marines and labor unionists. 
  Lieutenant Governor Masanori and other prefectural 
government 
officials arrived at Prefectural Highway 14 at 0800 on the 
morning of 14 June when the live-fire exercise began. Katsuhiro 
Yoshida, chief of Kin town, told the lieutenant governor: 
"Forty years of live-firing exercise have turned Mt. Onna into 
a treeless mountain. Nature there is being destroyed. Red soil 
from training grounds where trees and rocks have disappeared are 
destroying Kin Bay. I want the live-firing exercise halted 
immediately." The town chief also pleaded with the lieutenant 
governor for an early enactment of the Military Land Conversion 
Law to promote the effective use of military lands to be 
returned. 
  In response, the lieutenant governor said: "U.S. Forces in 
Okinawa are certainly moving to cut back their training. 
However, the live-firing exercise is not a problem that can be 
resolved simply by streamlining and scaling back U.S. military 
bases in Okinawa. The exercises should be halted completely. I 
intend to speak out against the exercises with the residents' 
sufferings in mind." 
  One shell after another was fired into Mt. Onna when the 
lieutenant governor observed the live-firing exercise.

"Economic Measures With View To Effect Overseas; Growing 
Mobility of Capital; Japan's Surplus Does Not Cause Bad Effects"] 
  [Excerpts] 1) Currently, international capital 
movements are increasing. Economic stimulus measures should be 
considered under an open macro model like the "Mandel-Fleming 
model." According to the model, the higher capital mobility is 
and the smaller the relative weight a country has in the global 
economy, the less effective are measures to expand demand. When 
we consider the degree of capital mobility and our size in the 
world economy, as well as the effects that future income produce 
on current savings, we cannot expect too much effect from this 
February's comprehensive economic measures. 
  2) Even though we cannot expect effects on domestic 
income, the chances are good for ripple effects on other 
nations' income. Also, Japan's current accounts surplus does not 
cause a worsening of the world business climate. 
  3) Policy dialogues are ever more needed so as to 
mutually understand each country's policies and gauge the 
effects that domestic demand expansion will have on every other 
nation. 
<H5>  Fears of Comprehensive Economic Measures's Ineffectiveness </H5>
  It has been 20 years since the shift to a floating exchange 
rate system, and during this time economic interchange 
domestically and abroad has become quite activated. Impacts that 
Japanese economic policies have on other nations' economies can 
no longer be disregarded. The comprehensive economic measures 
announced February 1994 have drawn attention not only at home 
but from abroad as well, and the United States has repeatedly 
expressed its disappointment. 
  As the interdependence of domestic and foreign economies 
grows, one must use open macro models covering not just the 
domestic but the foreign as well when scrutinizing the effects 
of economic countermeasures. However, a major point at issue in 
evaluating these comprehensive economic measures is how large 
the ultimate direct increase in demand will be. We can hardly 
find any cases in which changes in things like exchange rates 
and interest rates and their effects are explicitly considered. 
  A typical case of a Keynesian model taking the scope of 
capital mobility into consideration is the Mandel-Fleming model. 
In this model what is distinctive is the point that it 
emphasizes the role of capital mobility. When capital mobility 
is high under a floating exchange rate market, measures to 
expand internal demand are cutting taxes, augmenting public 
investment, and setting rates of interest on the high side. That 
will bring a massive capital influx and force up currency 
values. For small nations, the result will be that foreign 
demand (current account balances) will decrease to that extent 
even if measures to expand domestic demand are adopted, and 
overall demand will be unchanged, making measures on the macro 
business climate quite invalid. 
  However, as Japan is no small nation and since we cannot 
conceive of domestic and foreign interest rates being congruent 
as U.S. economist Robert Mandel hypothesized, we cannot apply 
this conclusion as is. If we take these into consideration and 
revise them, measures stimulating internal demand would not be 
ineffective but would bring on high interest rates, a strong 
yen, financial balances going into deficit, and a shrinkage in 
the current accounts balance surplus. So, we are led to the 
conclusion that we cannot expect much of a rise in the domestic 
business climate. [passage omitted] 
  The world's current account balances taken together add up 
to 
zero; however, when we consider such things as that limitation 
not applying to financial balances or the ripple effects from 
other nations, we cannot always get results precisely according 
to the model. Still, we may not be able to call adopting the 
Mandel style of thinking inappropriate. 
  Lately, attention is being drawn to ideas that seek to get 
decisions on consumption and savings by explicitly taking into 
consideration even income expected in the future. When one 
brings those ideas into decisions about consumption and savings, 
the effectiveness of measures to stimulate internal demand 
becomes lower. If we look into these ideas, policies cutting 
income taxes become totally ineffective regardless of whether 
financial resources are from increased taxes or issuance of 
government deficit bonds. Deficit government bonds mean 
increased taxes in the future, but since consumption is decided 
upon by taking that into consideration, even if taxes are cut, 
savings will merely increase, preparing for future increased 
taxes. Such thinking is called "Ricardo's neutrality thesis." 
  This idea is often applied in criticizing the Ministry of 
Finance's challenge to the issuance of deficit government bonds, 
but I cannot believe this thesis will be rigorously put into 
effect. Yet, there is corroborative analysis that we cannot 
negate this thesis. Graph 2 [not translated] shows the ratios of 
the government's net receipts to gross domestic product (GDP) 
and shifts in household savings rates in Japan. In times of 
growing government net receipts, the domestic savings rate 
decreases; therefore, we may be unable to ignore completely that 
thesis even in Japan. 
  If we thus take into consideration savings rate changes due 
to policies, the economic stimulative effects will be even less. 
  It is not that such theoretical ideas as the above have been 
totally ignored in the recent policy debates. In evaluating the 
economic measures this time, we saw many adopting views dubious 
about the effects of tax cuts which projected increased taxes. 
On the other hand, we also came across arguments which, from a 
standpoint not assuming the neutrality thesis's effectuation, 
would link recent high interest rates to issuance of government 
deficit bonds by cutting taxes. 
  However, on exchange rates, arguments emerge such as that 
the 
United States will work to induce a higher yen if Japan does not 
adequately stimulate domestic demand, or that stimulating 
internal demand will cut current account surpluses and so reduce 
external frictions and hence "the wise way is to stimulate 
internal demand if we want to avoid a higher yen." Yet, there is 
very little sense of its being axiomatic that we will get a high 
yen from stimulating domestic demand. Consequently, we do not 
know how correctly the measures for stimulating domestic demand 
are being evaluated. 
<H5>  Ripple Effects Overseas Cannot Be Ignored </H5>
  When the scale of direct stimulation of domestic demand is 
small or when the private sector reacts to government actions in 
such a way as to offset them, there are no ripple effects either 
at home or abroad. Nor do current account surpluses change. 
However, if the offsetting effects by the private sector are not 
so large, measures to stimulate domestic demand may not be 
effective, we cannot ignore their ripple effect overseas. 
  To reflect on this point, let us consider a simple global 
model resembling the economic structure for all nations. If we 
include each nation's method for determining incomes, the sum of 
external demand will be zero. Hence, we can treat the world as a 
closed economy. In short, the world's business climate is 
determined by the scale of the total of internal demand in all 
nations. Global income and decisions on interest rates do not 
relate either to capital mobility or to the degree of mutual 
trade dependence. Moreover, whatever nation uses them, effective 
demand measures will have the same impact on global income. The 
issue is how the effects are apportioned to each nation. 
  In cases such as in the Mandel-Fleming model where they are 
balanced and internal and external interest rates are in accord, 
the distribution from measures stimulating internal demand will 
be determined by a nation's size. Hence, when a major nation 
puts internal-demand expansion measures into effect, the impact 
at home will be great while the ripple effect on foreign nations 
will be small. More so than if the United States boosts its 
internal demand, Japan's stimulating its internal demand would 
have the effect of causing the portion spilling over into other 
nations to be larger. 
  However, when capital mobility is not very great, since the 
currency of the nation carrying out such policies does not rise 
very much, the ripple effect abroad will become a bit smaller. 
  In addition, although the scale of ripple effects will 
differ 
under a variety of major factors, those are assuredly in a 
positive direction. A rise in interest rates will come about 
through this process and that is often criticized by foreign 
nations. For other nations, however, the effect of lowering the 
value of the currency will be larger than the rise in interest 
rates. 
<H5>  Give Weight to Policy Dialogues With Other Nations </H5>
  In Japan's current expansion of its current accounts 
balance, 
there is an aspect of ripple effects of the U.S. economic 
expansion. The ripple effect from the United States is 
defensive. Problem is that, seeing the surpluses caused by that 
and view this as robbing it of employment. Also, economic growth 
rates have often been an aim of promises made abroad; however, 
the smaller a nation is which stimulates its internal demand the 
more other nations' income will grow without increasing domestic 
income. It is absurd to judge its contribution to a foreign 
nation's economy from the resulting economic growth rate. 
  Again, from the fact that global internal demand determines 
the world's business climate, surpluses in Japan's current 
accounts do not cause adverse effects on the world's business 
climate. To say that Japan's current account surpluses are a 
problem, we must say that foreign nations' current account 
deficits--the other side of Japan's current account 
surpluses--restrain global internal demand. 
  However, aside from such cases as heavily indebted 
developing 
nations, such restraints are inconceivable for advanced nations 
whose capital mobility is high. For example, we cannot conceive 
of the U.S. economic policies being constrained by current 
account deficits. If there were such an aspect to the United 
States, we would not have to concern ourselves with the matter 
of how to get the United States to take up fiscal moderation. 
This problem is always an issue when considering reforms of the 
international currency system, but no solution has been found 
yet. Where could there be an advanced nation whose economic 
policies are being restrained because its current accounts are 
in deficit? 
  With measures stimulating domestic demand by tax cuts and 
public investment, if an easy-money policy is adopted at the 
same time, when increases in income cannot be expected much, 
interest rates will fall and currency will lose value. Hence, 
impacts can be expected domestically. But an easy-money policy 
has adverse effects on other nations' incomes by raising 
currency valuations; therefore, it is undesirable for those 
nations' economies. It should be also clear from this that it is 
absurd to evaluate the degree of contribution to foreign 
nations' economies by economic growth rate record. 
  In any case, ripple effects vary greatly depending on 
policies; therefore, exchanges of views on what kinds of 
policies each nation seeks to adopt become important. Policy 
dialogues internally and abroad will become increasingly vital 
in the future so that to judge whether for the world as a whole 
the scale of internal demand is appropriate.

Bank of Japan: "Extend Export Exchange Contracts to Four or Five 
Years--Strive To Avoid Losses From Quotation Differences; Part 
of Financial Activities for Which Comprehensive Management Is 
Needed"] 
  [Text] 1) The manner in which currency risk 
management is conducted in Japan's export industries is one of 
the reasons that corporate performances falter when the yen 
appreciates. If export industries improve risk management 
through longer term exchange contracts, business deterioration 
can be avoided to some extent even if the yen appreciates. 
  Industrial structure changes necessitated by yen 
appreciation 
can also be carried out more smoothly. 
  2) If exchange risks are hedged beforehand, the action 
will become a pressure against yen appreciation and currency 
adjustments will proceed rapidly; therefore, it will become a 
factor in curbing excessive investments in the export business 
and in restraining trade imbalances. 
  3) To develop stablility and soundness in the Japanese 
economy, the reassessment of ALM (Assets and Liabilities 
Management) process of individual corporations and agumentation 
of their management structures are necessary. 
<H5>  6-Month Period Is Too Short for Hedging </H5>
  The exchange fluctuation rate was 10 percent, on an annual 
basis, during the 20 years from 1973 to 1992. That means that 
Japanese export industries continued to export while shouldering 
the risk that yen-denominated sales proceeds which fluctuate 
about 10 percent annually. During the same 20-year period from 
1973 to 1992, the number of automobiles sold in the U.S. market 
fluctuated at an annual rate of 10 percent. This can be called 
the "business risk" of fluctuating sales affected by changes in 
the economy. In other words, as for exports, the "exchange risk" 
that proceeds would decrease because of the yen's appreciation 
was as big a risk as the "business risk" of declining sales and 
receipts due to deteriorating business conditions. 
  Many people think that "the currency risk should naturally 
be 
big for export industries," and that is actually true. The 
problem is, although the exchange risk can be hedged by simply 
using forward exchange contracts, that action has been neglected. 
  It is commonly believed that "export industries are using 
forward exchange contracts as a hedge." At present, however, 
forward contracts of export industries cover, at the most, only 
about half of the annual exports, i.e., only sales up to about 
six months ahead. Japan's export industries cannot stop 
exporting suddenly even if the yen appreciates. If exports are 
to be continued with existing production capabilities, it is 
clear that, if the yen appreciates (after six months), 
yen-denominated sales proceeds would decrease and difficulties 
would arise (even if product prices are raised on 
dollar-denominated basis, sales volume would decline; therefore, 
yen-denominated proceeds would decrease). Therefore, business 
would slump in Japan if the yen appreciates. 
  Since forward exchange contracts of present export 
industries 
cover too short a duration, there is practically no hedge 
against exchange risks. It might be said that they are 
conducting business operations while carrying an enormous 
exchange risk. To avoid this, they must conclude forward 
contracts covering exports over a longer period of time. 
Considering the depreciation period of the current export 
production lines and the employment situation, flexibility of 
product prices, etc., forward exchange contracts needed as 
actual risk hedges must cover four to five years and over 10 
times the current monetary amount. Then, the predicament of 
carrying the obvious and enormous exchange risk of business 
deterioration from yen appreciation can be evaded. 
  If exports spreading over four or five years are hedged, the 
exports made with current facilities will be settled on a 
yen-denominated basis even if the yen appreciates; therefore, 
there will be ample time for corporate structural changes in 
case the management strategy is taken to reduce exports in 
stages and promote local production. Also, management can avoid 
sudden setbacks caused by yen appreciation. 
  The same line of thinking should apply when making new 
capital investments. When setting up production lines for 
exports, basically, the exchange rate that can be contracted 
into the future must be made the standard. Proceeds of exported 
products that are manufacturd at these export production lines 
should be received in dollars in the future. The export proceeds 
to be received in the future should basically be hedged and the 
possible contract rate should become the basis of investment 
planning. Concretely, annual capital investments will be hedged 
with the output intended for exports to be used as the basis to 
calculate the dollar-denominated cash flow. 
  If such exchange risk hedges had been in place in the past, 
what would've been the effects on currency markets and 
macroecnomics? If Japan's export industries had exercised 
exchange risk management and concluded long- and medium-term 
forward exchange contracts for anticipated exports, the yen 
would have appreciated sooner under the dollar-selling pressure 
of forward contracts and industrial structure changes would have 
proceeded rapidly while the present trade frictions could have 
been averted to some extent. 
<H5>  Concept To Increase Corporate "Current Value" </H5>
  Long- and medium-term forward exchange contracts are 
basically similar to the short-term forward contracts frequently 
used in export contracts and have been used by Japanese 
corporations since early 1980's to hedge currency risks of 
foreign currency-denominated debentures issued by corporations. 
  Meanwhile, long- and medium-term forward exchange contracts 
from an ALM standpoint, including hedging of future exports, 
have become possible institutionally through the abolishment of 
the actual demand rule in 1984. Subsequently, the ALM concept 
has not permeated the corporate circle and even today, hedging 
operations are limited to hedges against financial risks, such 
as hedging foreign currency-denominated corporate bonds and 
hedging a company's product inventories through short-term 
export contracts. Movements to hedge against exchange risks, 
from an overall corporate ALM standpoint, are not apparent. 
  To control risks, such as those created by currency 
fluctuations, Japanese corporations must basically reassess the 
past process of business management and change to a 
comprehensive ALM setup. First, in the past emphasis tended to 
be focused on profits and losses of a settlement period revealed 
through financial accounting. Hereafter, it is important to 
introduce the concept of increasing the current value of the 
entire corporation. 
  Second, in the past attention tended to be directed to 
financial risk management, but hereafter, attention must be paid 
to overall corporate risk management, based on cash flow in 
business operations, such as future payments for exports and raw 
materials. Third, the use of hedging measures, such as 
derivatives, are important to control risks. 
  Periodic profits and losses based on financial accounting 
can 
be exaggerated, e.g., by including latent profits of stock 
holdings or through various other settlement manipulations. In 
such cases, since the values that should be realized in the 
future are being preempted for the current year, it is the same 
as passing the bill for that amount to subsequent years. 
Actually, there are cases that latent losses are being carried 
on the basis of book rate valuations because of forward contract 
extensions or that latent losses are being carried because of 
price declines of stock holdings; therefore, there are many 
cases that the periodic profits and losses appear favorable, but 
the real conditions of the company are worsening. 
  In enforcing ALM, therefore, the operations must include 
control of latent profits and losses. To do this, the concept of 
"current value," which expresses the real economic value, must 
be employed. "Current value equals book value plus or minus 
latent profits and losses" and the "current value profits and 
losses equal periodic profits and losses plus or minus latent 
profits and losses." Therefore, the aim of ALM is to increase 
the "current value" of a company by including all of the 
potential profits and losses in a consolidated form. A company's 
current value is assessed in the stock market as the total 
market value of its shares; therefore, increasing the current 
value has the same effect as increasing its stock prices. 
  Since a company's current value is computed on the basis of 
"current value of its assets and liabilities," ALM is concerned 
with market values of assets and liabilities. Risk calculations 
are made by figuring out how current values of assets and 
liabilities are altered by risk factors, such as interest and 
exchange rate fluctuations, commodity price variations, etc. 
Risk management, employing hedging measures, should be carried 
out to minimize these risks and maximize the company's current 
value. This series of actions constitutes "ALM." 
  In the process of calculating current values, it is 
necessary 
to consider the entire cash flow, including future receipts and 
payments expected by the company. This action is the first step 
in sound "ALM" that considers latent profits and losses. At 
present, financial cash flows, such as interest payments and 
foreign bond issuances, are managed relatively well, but there 
are many cases that cash flows involving exports and raw 
materiel payments are taken for granted and not considered as 
factors for risk management. In other words, interest and 
exchange rate risks affecting financial status are managed, but 
risks involving exports, imports, and raw materials tend to be 
neglected although the concerned sums are relatively large. The 
exchange risk affecting the sales of export industries is a 
typical example. 
  Furthermore, since these risks are often managed separately, 
the interrelationships between risks tend to be ignored. Since 
there are cases that risks hedge against each other, it is 
essential to consider comprehensive risk management which takes 
into account all of the company's risks. 
  For example, let us consider the case of a company, which is 
engaged in exports to the United States, issuing 
dollar-denominated corporate bonds. If the yen appreciates, the 
yen-denominated value of cash inflow from future exports to the 
United States will decrease, but since the yen-denominated value 
of cash outflow in future payments on dollar bonds will also 
decrease, both are hedging each other against exchange risks. If 
attention is paid only to the exchange risk in the financial 
sector and dollar bonds are hedged on yen-denominated basis, the 
exchange risk is being enlarged from the overall company 
standpoint. 
<H5>  Swaps, Etc., Are Inexpensive </H5>
  Risk management must be flexible when undertaking ALM. The 
use of long- and medium-term forward exchange contracts as well 
as the derivatives market, such as swaps, futures and options, 
will become important. Derivatives are useful in providing the 
required amount of control, when needed, of necessary risks and 
they are inexpensive. 
  Take exchange risks for example, there are cases that 
European automobile manufacturers have concluded long-term 
forward exchange contracts on exports to Japan, and leading 
U.S.-European corporations have fully established ALM setups. 
They are also aggressively using derivatives for hedging 
purposes. 
  In Japan, although there are many corporations dealing with 
exports and imports, there has been little progress in the 
establishment of ALM systems and utilization of risk hedging 
measures. If individual corporations establish the ALM 
structure, corporate values and performances will stabilize, and 
that will in turn lead to stability of the macroeconomics of 
this collective corporate body.

<F P=106> [Article in three installments by political reporters, Shuzo </F>
Sato for the first installment, Koichi Kobata for the second 
installment, and Isamu Niwa for the third installment: "Stormy 
Sailing--Hata `Minority Coalition' Regime"] 
<H5>  [30 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] "Recalling the period of eight months, I am proud to 
say that the coalition government has curved out a path for 
great and new Japanese politics. Ours has now become a 
government of a minority coalition, but we will do our best for 
smooth progress of Japan with sincerity and joint efforts." 
  On the night of 28 April [1994], at his first press 
conference since assuming the office, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata showed a touch of vexation at the condition in which he was 
forced to start the "Hata regime" with the minority of the 
ruling coalition. 
  Prime Minister Hata is "the choice" of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], and his government was born by easily obtaining 
a majority of votes--274 votes in the lower house and 127 votes 
in the upper house. Although the second coalition government 
appeared to make a smooth start, the foothold of the government 
crumbled from its foundation all at once when the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition 
government. 
  The genuine ruling coalition bolstering the government 
numbers 182, a little over one-third of the total in the lower 
house. The coalition force will only be 202 members even if to 
count the members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the new party of 
Mirai [the Future Party]. Sakigake left the coalition, pledging 
to cooperate from the outside of the cabinet and Mirai broke 
away from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and is assuming the 
pro-coalition stance. Things are severer in the upper house as 
the coalition holds 62 persons which account for only about 
one-fourth of the total strength. This explains the conditions 
under which "none of the bills can be passed" (a leading member 
of the ruling coalition in the upper house). 
  In his cabinet formation, Prime Minister Hata picked eight 
members from Shinseito and six from Komeito. The "Shinsei-Komei" 
tie has thus become strong. He has staffed his official 
residence by an excellent pair from Shinseito, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Naoto Kitamura. He reappointed Mr. Hirohisa Fujii to the post of 
finance minister who deals with tax system issue and Mr. Hajime 
Ishii to the post of home affairs minister who takes charge of 
political reform. Both of them are Shinseito members and thus in 
essence the prime minister has clearly indicated the "Shinseito 
leadership." 
  In the Hosokawa government, a rift between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
deprived the official residence of its centripetal force. That 
became a factor in inviting bureaucratic leadership. Hata seeks 
to solidify his official residence thereby to exercise power of 
control over bureaucrats. There are such aims in "Hata's 
personnel management." 
  The fate of Hata government hangs on a tax system reform and 
a bill for rezoning of single-seat constituencies with a 
proportional representation system. We can see that Hata 
cabinet poised to attempt a frontal breakthrough on these two 
pending bills. 
  With the SDPJ's secession from the government and Sakigake's 
cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, policy 
coordinations within the ruling coalition are likely to proceed 
smoothly unlike in the past. However, problem lies after that. 
At his press conference, Prime Minister Hata expressed his 
expectations for cooperation from both the LDP and the SDPJ, 
saying that "there was a word (from the SDPJ) that it would 
cooperate as best as it can for the benefit of the nation" and 
that, although we and the LDP may have clashes over some issues, 
"I believe the LDP will extend its cooperation on policy 
matters, and I would like to ask it to do so." However, the 
situation is not as optimistic as that. 
  The ruling coalition government desires to present the 
rezoning bill to the Diet as soon as possible after the fiscal 
1994 budget is approved. In addition to the election strategy of 
Shinseito which wants to carry out the election under a new 
system, the coalition government believes that "such a step can 
forestall the introduction of a no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet by the LDP and the SDPJ" (a leading member of the ruling 
coalition). 
  However, there is a tenacious voice, within both the LDP and 
the SDPJ, calling for the dissolution of the lower house and a 
general election under the existing system; therefore, 
undoubtedly there will be fierce quarrels between ruling and 
opposition parties after passage of the proposed budget. 
  With the "question of 100 million yen loans" from the Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking firm to former Prime Minister Hosokawa still 
remaining unsettled, the issue may easily turn into a factor for 
a great turbulence, depending on the opposition parties' 
approach to the issue. There are many seeds of fiery 
confrontation between ruling and opposition parties, including 
measures to cope with issues of nuclear development in the DPRK 
(North Korea). 
  In the Hosokawa regime, the initiative under the "Ichi-Ichi 
[Ichiro and Yuichi] line" by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa and Kometo Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa surfaced in 
various aspects. With the SDPJ and Sakigake having left the 
coalition, the "Ichi-Ichi line" could very well be brought out 
in relief in the Hata government. In what form will the 
opposition to such development take place? 
  Sadao Yamahana, member of the SDPJ and former minister in 
charge of political reform, asserted at a meeting of the party's 
Diet members on 28 April [1994] that "the Hata cabinet will be 
unable to fulfil the role greater than one assigned to a budget 
management cabinet." Voicing his feelings of desperation, a 
leading member of the ruling coalition made the following 
remarks: "We have no other choice but to make desperate efforts 
for the first two months. If we keep striving with the given 
minority, we may enlist sympathy for the weakling." 
  Without carrying enough "fuel," the ship "Shinsei-Hata Maru" 
is compelled to launch out on a stormy sea, bearing the destiny 
of the coalition government on its shoulder. The sea route to 
follow is invisible. The "political change in June theory" is 
increasingly acquiring a flavor of reality. 
<H5>  [1 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  }[Text] "Nobody knows what may happen tomorrow in the 
political world. Nothing has shown this more vividly than the 
recent political change," deplores one of Shinseito leaders. 
  Before dawn of 26 [April 1994], SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama announced his party's secession from the coalition 
government at a press conference he held urgently. 
  The SDPJ's secession from the government, the new Hata 
regime 
suddenly slid down to a "minority ruling coalition." A Komeito 
leader said, "A momentary judgment often sways one's fate, 
bringing one's prosperity or fall." 
  At his first inaugural press conference on 28 April, Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata touched on the formation of a joint 
parliamentary union called the "Reform" which led to [Hata's] 
"fall into Hell from Heaven" (a leading Shinseito member) 
through the SDPJ's secession from the government. Gnawing his 
lips, the prime minister made the following remarks: "I did not 
know that things were proceeding that way. As things were 
getting serious, I became aware that there were some mutual 
misunderstandings, but it was already too late then." His words 
sounded as if to suggest a difficult future of the Hata regime. 
  The unfolding new political situation of the Hata regime 
foreshadows a desperate struggle and confusion involving both 
ruling and opposition parties. There are three major forces: the 
"ruling coalition" formed by Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New 
Party [JNP], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the 
Liberal Party; the LDP; and the SDPJ. In addition, Sakigake, 
which shifted to cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, 
and Mirai, a new party which has broken away from the LDP, will 
also be entangled complicatedly. 
  China's RENMIN RIBAO reported: "Viewed from a historic 
angle, 
Japan's political situation is reminiscent of its `age of civil 
strife.' A great upheaval is continuing, and the map of the 
political quarters will remain unclear until the end of the next 
election." 
  The "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa 
displayed a initiative in the former Hosokawa regime and also in 
making the current Hata regime. The high-handed political 
methods of this line drove Sakigake, which is led by former 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, into outside-Cabinet 
cooperation and invited the SDPJ's "rebellion." Though not 
openly, a voice calling for reconsidering the "Ichi-Ichi line" 
is being raised gradually inside Shinseito and Komeito, and the 
"Ichi-Ichi line" appears to have reached the crucial point. 
  Mr. Ozawa and his followers are now elaborating on the next 
gambit to make up for their "great miscalculation" that resulted 
in the SDPJ's secession from the government. It is a gambit for 
setting off a split between the LDP and the SDPJ and making the 
political situation fluid toward a new realignment of the 
political world. To this end, it will be sought to pass a bill 
on rezoning of single-seat constituency system for lower house 
even at the cost of prolonging the current Diet session 
(scheduled to end on 29 June). This is because when the 
single-seat constituency system is realized, a large number of 
LDP and SDPJ Diet members will lose their seats, thereby 
inevitably accelerating the realignment of the political world. 
  Prior to such a development, both the LDP and the SDPJ, the 
two giants of the "1955 system," with their strategies to expand 
their influences by bringing about a Diet dissolution and a 
general election under the existing medium-size constituency. 
After its secession from the government, the SDPJ immediately 
had its general secretary talk with the LDP's secretary general, 
exploring the way for the "LDP-SDPJ tieup." Fierce offensive and 
defensive battles are inevitable between new and old forces over 
handling of the proposed budget and the single-seat constituency 
rezoning bill until the end of the current Diet session. 
  Amid this process, activities for "liquidizing" the 
political 
situation will further deepen, and "various combinations of 
alliance and league will be groped for below the surface of the 
water" (a leading SDPJ member). The minor new parties, Sakigake 
and Mirai, "must rack their brains over how to steer themselves 
among alliances and leagues and grab a casting vote" (a leading 
Sakigake member). 
  Only a few days have passed since the Hata cabinet started, 
but a theory is already afloat in Nagata-cho [where Diet 
building is located] that "the general election will be held on 
24 July." This marks the beginning of a war of information on 
the political situation. 
  The plot of the "24 July" theory is as follows: Toward the 
end of June, the issue of extending the session of the Diet will 
be raised over the handling of the proposed budget and the 
singel-seat constituency rezoning bill. Such an extension will 
conflict with deadlines set for the settlement of the ruling 
coalition's tax reform bills and the government's market-opening 
measures. There is also a strong possibility that the LDP and 
the SDPJ will jointly bring forward a no-confidence motion 
against the cabinet. The political situation will get 
"liquidized" at a stroke. The Naple summit (the meeting of 
leaders of advanced countries), to be held from 8 to 10 July, is 
also around the corner. Under this scenario, through a period 
covering before and after the summit meeting, the lower house 
will be dissolved and the holding of the general election will 
be publicly announced. 
  "Anything could happen from now on and I will not be 
surprised." 
  "I will race ahead, bracing myself like a soldier on the 
battlefield." 
  These sharp words have been uttered successively by ruling 
and opposition party lawmakers who were leaving for their local 
constituencies to spend a long consecutive holidays. 
<H5>  [2 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] "It is an extremely weak cabinet by a minority 
ruling coalition. More than half of the lawmakers elected by the 
people do not entertain expectations." "When the prime minister 
is not the top strong man leading Shinseito (the largest party 
in the ruling camp), we know that the power has a dual 
structure." 
  On the evening of 28 April [1994] when the Hata regime 
started, LDP President Yohei Kono scathingly criticized the 
Shinseito-led new government. The use of the phrase "extremely 
weak cabinet" was even suggestive of his tenacious desire to 
overthrow the cabinet. 
  The LDP was cheered by the SDPJ's secession from the 
government. It sets out to build a "joint front" with the SDPJ, 
saying that "the LDP versus non-LDP shackles have now been 
removed" (a leading member). On 27 April, the day after the 
secession was declared, [LDP] Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and 
[SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo confirmed close tieup in 
the future Diet operation, and this position was reconfirmed at 
a later meeting of the Diet Affairs Committee chairmen. 
  The catchword of the tieup is "opposition to the high-handed 
use of power." This means that they will join hands under the 
logic that "an enemy's enemy is a friend" in opposition to the 
so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" political method employed by 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa, "a method ignoring parliamentary 
democracy" in the LDP's view. 
  One of the leading members of the LDP says that "when the 
LDP 
and the SDPJ join hands, they can grab and exercise 
life-and-death power over all bills." Their strategy is very 
clear. 
  Their position is that they may allow the proposed fiscal 
1994 budget to be approved, but that "things will be different 
after that." Immediately after the budget is approved, they will 
submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet and ask for 
its general resignation. While taking these actions, they will 
be even ready for the dissolution of the lower house and the 
general election. 
  LDP President Kono even went so far as declaring that "after 
the budget approval, there will be no more work to do for the 
new government." Until then, they are planning to undercut the 
government by thoroughly inquiring into former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's alleged improprieties. 
  Under this strategy, they are going to take the offensive 
for 
the "recapturing of standing committee chairmanships." The LDP 
and the SDPJ have 280 seats (206 seats for the LDP and 74 seats 
for the SDPJ) in the lower house, and this strength enables the 
opposition camp to form, so to speak, a "stable majority (270 
seats). They thus reckon that "theoretically, every post can be 
recaptured" (a leading member of the Mitsuzuka faction). As a 
first step, to bind the new government's hands and feet, the 
focuse of their target is in having surrendered the chairmanship 
of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Rules and 
Administration--the the key post for steering of the Diet. 
  However, at this stage, such tieup between the LDP and the 
SDPJ aims at no farther than the "overthrowing of the cabinet." 
In addition to the fear of the tieup being exposed to criticism 
that it marks a retrogression toward the 1955 system, there is 
an opposing view within the LDP that "the SDPJ is too afar from 
LDP in terms of policy" (a leading member of the Watanabe 
faction). Secretary General Mori, at the 28 April summit 
meeting, stated that "the joint struggle will be restricted 
within the house (Diet steering)," stressing that it did not 
presuppose a great coalition. The same is the case with the 
SDPJ. Immediately after the tieup was mutually confirmed, the 
party headquarters was flooded with the calls of protest, and it 
was busy explaining that "we are not joining in the work of 
restoring the LDP regime" (a leading member). 
  Since it lost the office in July 1993, the LDP has 
constantly 
been exposed to the danger of another split. During the period, 
20 members left the party through confrontations between 
supporters of the political reform legislation and those calling 
for a prudent approach, and the post-Hosokawa turmoil over 
former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's defection and 
formation of a new party. The intraparty situation is not 
monolithic, and the aftereffects of those events are lingering. 
The executive leadership is busy working to avoid a split, and 
party reform is also left halfway. A leader admits the actual 
situation that "people see the coalition shaking; yet we hear no 
voice saying that let the LDP have power." 
  There are signs that the political world is drifting toward 
a 
"tripolar structure" divided largely by the ruling coalition, 
the LDP, and the SDPJ-Sakigake. Amid these signs, it is doubtful 
that any one bloc can single-handedly assume power. Both the LDP 
and the SDPJ are not free from the danger of intraparty split as 
well. 
  An elder lawmaker says: "From now on, we will be in the 
world 
of the history of the `Three States' [China's old wartime 
history book]. Activities will be swayed by party interests and 
individual interests. You may see a friend yesterday turn 
against you today." The LDP clearly upholds the position of 
overthrowing the present cabinet, and yet it fails to depict a 
firm scenario of its seizure of power. In such a condition the 
LDP is about to rush into the work of promoting fluidity in the 
political situation.

<F P=106> [Articles in three installments by ASAHI SHIMBUN political </F>
reporters; Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Etsuya Saito, Seiki Nemoto: "Hata 
Government Heading for Vortex of Realignment"] [30 Apr 94 p 2] 
  [Text] "The trend of the times cannot be halted. It has 
progressed beyond my expectations." 
  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] spoke thus during the selection of a successor to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. A political upheaval occasionally 
moves beyond the expectations of politicians. For Ozawa, who 
revolved the stage in a drama of a series of political changes 
from the previous prime minister's announcement of resignation 
to the inauguration of the new Hata cabinet, the withdrawal by 
the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] and the fall (of the 
administration) to a minority ruling coalition were undoubtedly 
unexpected evolvements as well. 
  Ozawa's initial strategy was to link the Hosokawa cabinet's 
departure to act 2 of political reorganization. His plan was to 
destroy the framework of the "LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]" 
versus the "non-LDP" that divided the ruling parties and the 
opposition and to marshal together a new political force by 
attracting a portion of the LDP and the SDPJ rightwing with 
Shinseito and Komeito in the center. 
<H5>  Non-LDP Exposes Limmitations </H5>
  The framework of the "non-LDP" forming the coalition 
administration had already exposed its limitations during the 
midpoint of the Hosokawa government. 
  In February [1994] the people's welfare tax concept 
initiated 
by Shinseito and Komeito was withdrawn due to opposition by the 
SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger]. The liberalization of the rice 
market and the political reform-related law also faced a 
"crisis" because of resistance by the SDPJ Diet members. 
Dissatisfaction was expressed by Shinseito that "under the 
present coalition framework, a policy evolvement with mobility 
is impossible." Meanwhile, the SDPJ also intensified its 
distrust of Ozawa et al for their "strongman tactics." 
  Regarding the selection of Hosokawa's successor, Ozawa tried 
his luck at "changing the coalition makeup." Support for former 
deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe was 
his trump card. His calculation was as follows: The SDPJ splits 
over support for Watanabe and its leftwing bolts from the 
administration. The gap is filled by deserters from the LDP. 
  Against this shakeup by Ozawa and his aides, the SDPJ braced 
itself to resist by uniting with Sakigake party and a portion of 
the DSP [Democratic Social Party] to which the SDPJ drew closer 
by its response to the people's welfare tax concept. The moves 
in search of a marshaling of "social democratic/liberal" forces 
including a portion of the LDP surfaced, and talk of an 
"LDP-SDPJ coalition" based on "an eye for an eye, and a tooth 
for a tooth" viewpoint was heard within the SDPJ. 
  The contradictions within the coalition 
administration--i.e., 
distortions between combinations of the political parties and 
policies, and differences in political methods--suddenly emerged 
with Hosokawa's resignation announcement. Each party definitely 
sensed the coming of "act 2 of reorganization." However, given 
the sudden resignation notice, every party was caught 
unprepared. An agreement by the coalition ruling parties to 
maintain the coalition framework and unified support for Hata 
constituted a kind of "political ceasefire." "The real battle 
comes two months from now." This was the view of the executives 
of each party. 
<H5>  SDPJ Rightwing Also Breaks Away </H5>
  However, the formation of the "Kaishin" [Renovation] new 
faction in the lower house raised unexpected tremors within the 
political circles. As the Shinseito executives admitted that "we 
underestimated the SDPJ," Ozawa had apparently never dreamed 
that it would result in the SDPJ's secession from the 
administration, forcing the Hata administration into the 
position of a minority government. 
  The greatest miscalculation was probably forcing secession 
by 
the SDPJ rightwing forces that had been the most aggressive 
supporters of the coalition. Even General Seceretary Wataru 
Kubo, who had taken pains to maintain solidarity with the 
coalition parties in the face of attacks from the SDPJ leftwing, 
vented his anger at the surprise formation of the new faction by 
stating: "There is a limit to my patience." 
  The leaders of the SDPJ who left the government are already 
making contacts with the leaders of the LDP and Sakigake party. 
Their mottoes are: "Let us protect the principles of democracy" 
and "let us be antifascists." Criticism of Ozawa's tactics thus 
continue. 
<H5>  Encirclement by LDP-SDPJ </H5>
  Contrary to the spliting of both the LDP and the SDPJ 
envisioned by Ozawa, an ironic twist is in the making of an 
"anti-Shinseito and anti-Komeito encirclement" by the LDP and 
SDPJ that have sustained the 1955 political system. However, 
major LDP-SDPJ differences concerning the basic policies of 
foreign affairs and defense remain, and there is a lack of 
realism in their cooperation. Their sole unity may exist in 
their joint struggle for an early dissolution of the lower house 
and a general election. 
  There are also serious internal circumstances in the 
coalition administration following the SDPJ's separation. There 
is fear within Shinseito and Komeito of a decline into a 
minority administration, and criticism within the DSP bursting 
forth against Chairman Keigo Ouchi who proposed the formation of 
the new faction. The Japan New Party is also affected by a 
fallout among its members. 
  With the inauguration of a minority administration resulting 
from the SDPJ secession, what is the future direction of 
political realignment? Will the formation of a policy-oriented 
framework which is seen as a "temporary ceasefire" revive 
itself? Without anyone seemingly convinced of it, the 
realignment drama moves on to the next act. 
<H5>  [1 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] LDP President Yohei Kono used the term "tactics" 
four times and the term "high-handed" three times in his short 
statement. "The high-pressure, high-handed tactics of Shinseito 
does not represent the inherent posture of parliamentary 
democracy." 
  It was on the morning of 26 April [1994] when the SDPJ 
rejected the newly formed faction "Kaishin" [Rennovation] and 
was asked by reporters for its thoughts concerning its secession 
from the coalition administration. Although he mentioned no 
names, it was clear that Kono's barbs were aimed at Shinseito 
General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the man behind Prime Minister 
Hata. 
  Kono had previously maintained that "what Ozawa has in mind 
is only how to retain his position of power." He once warned 
Michio Watanabe, who had indicated his desire to join Ozawa in 
seeking government rule, saying: "The man you are trying to join 
hands with is trying to destroy the LDP." 
<H5>  Strong Reaction Against Tactics </H5>
  "Pro-Ozawa" or anti-Ozawa?" The axis of the opposition which 
caused confusion in the political situation until the 
inauguration of the Hata cabinet was, more than anything else, 
"Ozawa's tactics and orientation." The sudden formation of the 
new faction "Kaishin" among the ruling parties by Ozawa et al 
led to the SDPJ's decision to leave the coalition is found in 
the tactics rather than in the confrontation over ideas and 
policies. 
  The SDPJ has become an opposition party. The possibility of 
an "LDP-SDPJ union" is also mentioned. However, there is no 
reason to expect that a "joint struggle" based on reaction 
against Ozawa's tactics alone will continue forever. There are 
many Dietmen within the LDP who also support the policies 
advocated by Ozawa--for example, his debate for a "ordinary 
nation" that will welcome international contribution in military 
actions. The LDP executive branch has tended in the past to 
avoid frontal argument against Ozawa's policy contentions. It 
stems from the fear that, if it intrudes, policy distortions 
will inevitably surface and could invite the party to split 
again in seeking solutions. 
  "The LDP has remained intact merely as a `ruling party' but 
with disparate ideas. After it lost its ruling power, those who 
could no longer tolerate the situation slipped away to join the 
administration parties. Unless some steps are taken soon, the 
party will only weaken." 
  Thus spoke an executive of the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction in 
self-derision while watching LDP deserters form the new party 
"Mirai" [Future] and the Liberal Party. 
  Being anti-Ozawa per se cannot constitute an axis for 
reorganization. Ideas and policies that form a "nucleus" are 
necessary to create a full-fledged framework. In that context, 
it was the aggregation of the "social democratic/liberal" forces 
that nebulously took form. 
<H5>  Aggregation of Liberals a Difficult Task </H5>
  On 27 April [1994] in a room at the National Diet Library, 
the following dialogue took place between Hiroyuki Sonoda, 
secretary general of Sakigake, and Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of the SDPJ. 
  [Sonoda] It is risky to join the LDP in its present state. 
  [Kubo] The SDPJ shares the same view. We prefer to emphasize 
cooperation with Sakigake party. 
  [Sonoda] In order to do so, the SDPJ must change 
drastically. 
  [Kubo] We understand that. 
  The six ruling parties and the LDP control about 200 seats 
respectively in the lower house. In contrast, the SDPJ and 
Sakigake together hold only about 90 seats. It sounds good to 
say that they hold the casting votes, but one false step could 
plunge them into oblivion in a whirl of reorganization. The key 
may be said to depend on whether they will be able to use the 
experience of the Hosokawa administration as a stepping stone 
and set a direction based on `realpolitik.' 
  The question is whether the "social democrats and liberals" 
can display a clear policy on such issues as the direction of 
welfare and obligation amid tax system reform and the 
relationship between the Constitution and interntional 
contribution. Rengo Chairman Yamagishi, who adopts a posture of 
support for the SDPJ, have any clear convictions, either. There 
is even a possibility that they will simply remain "reactionary" 
in opposition to the actions of Ozawa et al. 
<H5>  Watanage Is Unconvinced </H5>
  "Policies of the LDP and Shinseito are virtually identical. 
The shifting alignment of the political parties should have 
inherently depended on their policies." 
  It is reported that Watanabe, who ended up staying within 
the 
LDP, still gripes about his indeterminate feelings to the 
members of his faction. 
  Watanabe's abandonment of his decision to leave the LDP and 
the SDPJ's split from the coalition have further clouded the 
direction of political realignment. Political parties and Diet 
members must determine their positions before making their next 
moves. Will it be the "eradication of distorted policies" or 
"pro or con stance vis-a-vis Ozawa's methods?" The tide toward 
realignment also involves a quarrel over opposing axes. 
<H5>  [2 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] It was the forming of a new faction "Kaishin" that 
plunged the Hata administration into a minority ruling party. 
However, there was a foreshadowing event. Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito had thrust a "dagger" (Komeito 
Secretary Geneneral Yuichi Ichikawa) called "policy" in the face 
of the SDPJ that heated tensions to the boiling point. 
  On 18 April [1994] when policy discussions among the 
coalition ruling parties faced rough sailing, Ozawa met Hata at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told him: "I will do it. We 
may become a minority party. We could perhaps become an 
opposition party. Is that all right with you?" 
  The slogans of "political reform" and "non-LDP" that united 
the Hosokawa administration faded, and basic policy differences 
among the parties can no longer be kept secret. Meanwhile, 
Japan-U.S. economic relations and the issue of nuclear weapons 
development by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [North 
Korea] are approaching dangerous waters for Japan's diplomacy. 
Unless its policies are solidified, the "Hata administration," 
which may be regarded as its final trump card, will soon find 
itself a blind alley. 
<H5>  All-Out Emphasis on U.S. Relations </H5>
  In the policy discussions, Ozawa strongly demanded an 
inclusion of specific responses to the Korean Peninsular problem 
including "emergency legislation." He refused to compromise on a 
hike in the consumption tax rate, giving the continuation of the 
tax reduction measure which had become a public half-promise to 
the United States as his premise. Providing the backdrop was his 
posture of an all-out emphasis on the U.S. relations and 
cooperations when he said: "After the Cold war, as long as Japan 
keeps relations with the United States as its axis, our tasks 
concerning national security and economic policy are clear." 
  For Ozawa, the policy problems are problems of content as 
well as problems of decisionmaking process. 
  The Hosokawa administration as an "eight-horse carriage" 
ranging from the Shinseito to the SDPJ with different 
backgrounds has paid a high price for political coordination. 
The government's response has been on the defensive, and the 
Gulf war experience of being viewed coldly by the international 
society flashes through Ozawa's mind. It is not surprising if he 
thought that the Hata administration cannot cope unless its mode 
of operation is changed 180 degrees and a Shinseito-led 
leadership is established. 
<H5>  Outlook of a "Ordinary Nation" </H5>
  In fact, this also constitutes the heart of the "political 
reform" envisioned by Ozawa. 
  Because of the introduction of the "political 
party-oriented" 
single-seat constituency system, the LDP-SDPJ "dango" politics 
under the 1955 political system and the LDP's "total mainstream 
faction" politics will be rejected with power concentrated on 
the prime minister and speedier political decisionmaking as 
principal aims. The outlook for the future is a Japan that 
transcends "one-nation pacifism" and becomes a "ordinary nation" 
actively involved in the world in security terms. 
  Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita explained the 
"essense" of LDP politics in a recent lecture. "I highly 
evaluate the postwar role played by the SDPJ. In our policy 
choices, it would be just right if we implement three years from 
now what the SDPJ says." 
  Meanwhile, in the "Ozawa-style politics," the desire is seen 
to realize in a purer form the policies which the LDP was 
compelled to advance in increments while paying consideration to 
the SDPJ. 
  The fact that Koji Kakizawa, who was appointed foreign 
minister soon after leaving the LDP, immediately advocated a 
change in the government's interpretation, contending that "the 
exercise of the right of collective defense is not permitted by 
the constitution," may be considered as an indication (of 
Ozawa's style). The kind of assurance that the 1955 system 
offered to the people, for better or worse, does not exist there. 
<H5>  Spreading Rumor of a Government Change in June </H5>
  However, the SDPJ's split from the coalition immediately 
pushed the policy evolvement, which was targeted by Ozawa and 
embraced by Prime Minister Hata in terms of its direction, into 
a murky zone. In the political circles, a view is rapidly 
spreading that the Hata administration will last at best until 
the passing of FY94 budget and "a change in government in June" 
is publicly rumored. 
  At a press conference after his inauguration, the prime 
minister indicated his strong desire for a breakthrough in 
Japan-U.S. relations. However, a powerful administrative base is 
indispensable to change the economic structure through a 
continuing large-scale tax reduction and deregulation, which are 
decisive factors for trade surplus reduction, including a rein 
on the bureaucracy. There is also deep apprehension that how far 
the prime minister is being seriously considered as the 
counterpart in negotiations by the United States, which feels 
uneasy about the Hata administration's future. 
  There is a strong view that the confused political situation 
will continue for several months, with hints of a dissolution 
and a general election. Meanwhile, there are no signs of 
business recovery, improvement of Japan-U.S. relations has 
stalled, and the situation in the Korean peninsula is fraught 
with tensions. 
  The price paid by the prime minister and Ozawa is enormous.

<F P=106> [Article by AERA editorial board staff member Nobuo </F>
Kobayashi: "180 Days of Discord Between Ozawa and Yamagishi"] 
  [Text] It seems that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the strongman of the Hata 
administration, and Chairman Akira Yamagishi of the Japan Trade 
Union Confederation [Rengo], a big organization of eight million 
members, are generally thought to be on friendly terms with each 
other. 
  However, Shinseito, Nihon Shinto [Japan New Party], the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and others formed a new 
parliamentary group Kaishin [Renovation] on 25 April, 
immediately after the nomination of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
When the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] bolted from 
the coalition government in opposition to the formation of 
Kaishin on the following day, 26 April, Chairman Yamagishi said 
at once at a press conference concerning SDPJ's action: "I can 
understand the SDPJ's action and would like to support it." 
That remark made one wonder: "Has his relationship with Ozawa 
changed?" 
  When asked about the matter, Chairman Yamagishi said in 
reply: "Ozawa is a neo-conservative and I am a social democrat. 
From the beginning he has lived on the other side of the river, 
and I have come more and more to feel the distance." 
  In April, three attempts were made to arrange a meeting 
between the two men, but Chairman Yamagishi refused all of them. 
It is said that not only has Yamagishi never had a meeting with 
Ozawa since the beginning of this year, but also that he has not 
talked with Ozawa over the telephone at all. 
  Ozawa and Yamagishi played the lead roles in establishing 
the 
Hosokawa coalition government last summer, which put an end to 
the one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
However, it seems that the relationship between the two men has 
completely cooled, judging from Yamagishi's remarks. Are they 
really at odds with each other? 
  Let us set the hands of the clock back one year. On 20 
February last year, Ozawa and Yamagishi had a meeting. That was 
an important move which heralded the collapse of the LDP 
administration. The meeting was arranged by Tokai University 
Professor Kenzo Uchida, who is a common friend of the two men 
and one of the brains of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Ozawa told Yamagishi that the then Hata faction was 
determined to bolt from the LDP, and Yamagishi promised Ozawa 
that he would exercise his influence over the SDPJ. Thus, they 
reached a fundamental agreement concerning the establishment of 
a non-LDP coalition government. Professor Uchida says: "It is 
like the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu in the Meiji 
Restoration. Each had his own intentions and the two men got on 
well with each other until the passage of political reform 
bills." 
  The two men then had two meetings after the establishment of 
the Hosokawa administration, but, as Yamagishi says, they have 
not met since 16 December last year. 
  In fact, a meeting was once arranged for the two men on 4 
March this year. A mediator at that time was Dietman Akira 
Fukida, who was a leader of the Kato group built around 
Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato. Kato and others joined 
Shinseito in April, but they were regarded as "Ozawa's detached 
force" at that time. However, the Ozawa side asked for a 
postponement just before the scheduled meeting, and talks 
through this route were stopped. 
  At that time, the problem of the reshuffle of the cabinet 
was 
on the boil. It is not clear why the meeting was postponed and 
came to naught. When urged to have a meeting again and again by 
different sources, Yamagishi betrayed his strong dissatisfaction 
by saying: "Ozawa is rude and is contemplating divide-and-rule 
tactics." 
  Then came the post-Hosokawa period in April. Yamagishi named 
three mediators: besides Professor Uchida mentioned above, 
Rengo Secretary General Etsuya Washio, a strongman in Rengo, and 
Chairman Mototaka Ito of the Japan Postal Workers' Union.

  [Text] According to Yamagishi, when former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation on the night of 8 
April, Uchida and Washio one after the next asked Yamagishi over 
the phone to have a meeting with Ozawa. Four days later, on 12 
April, Ito met with Yamagishi in person and urged him to meet 
with Ozawa. 
  Uchida says: "I often told Yamagishi that 'it is about time 
to meet with Ozawa.' Yamagishi must have had a feeling that 'it 
is that guy who canceled the meeting, though he is a mere 
stripling.'" 
  About that time, the Ozawa side seemed to have a motive to 
arrange a meeting between the two men in order to prevent the 
move toward "a union between the LDP and the SDPJ, because it 
was thought that that union could be effected only through the 
mediation of Yamagishi, if it was to be effected at all. The 
circles close to Ozawa asked for Ito's cooperation by 
whispering: "We have positive evidence that Yamagishi is 
working for a union between the LDP and the SDPJ." 
  Ito explains the situation: "Ozawa asked me to arrange a 
meeting with Yamagishi because he had something to explain. 
Ozawa wanted to know if he could obtain a promise that the tax 
problem could be solved within the year in policy discussion 
with the SDPJ." 
  At the meeting of Yamagishi and Ito on 12 April, it was 
decided after all that "now is not the time for a meeting 
between Ozawa and Yamagishi." Three days later, on 15 April, 
Ito met with Yamagishi again, and after saying that "he will 
meet with Ozawa tomorrow," he had a meeting with Ozawa at All 
Nippon Airline's hotel in Tokyo on the following day, 16 April. 
The exact contents of the meeting are not known, but it seems 
that a discussion was held concerning the evaluation of the 
LDP's Michio Watanabe, the former deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister. 
  Incidentally, Washio, another mediator, is said to be the 
leader of the next generation in Rengo as well as a strong rival 
of Yamagishi. Moreover, Washio has close ties to Ozawa and is a 
positive advocate of political alignment. 
  Yamagishi is a born member of the SDPJ and has a deep 
feeling 
toward the SDPJ, while Washio's generation, which is twelve 
years younger than Yamagishi's, is gradually losing nostalgia 
for the SDPJ. The Japanese Federation of Iron and Steel 
Workers' Unions, of which Washio is chairman, conducted in the 
last year's general election "selective recommendation" in order 
to exclude SDPJ left- wing members from recommendation, and 
recommended, instead, five candidates from Shinseito. 
  When Ozawa asked for additional assistance, Washio gave him 
a 
forward-looking answer: "I will ask some of our locals to give 
their cooperation to Shinseito's candidates." 
  It is no wonder that Washio's and Ito's action as 
intermediaries for arranging a meeting between Yamagishi and 
Ozawa seemed to Yamagishi as Ozawa's intervention in Rengo. 
That is what Yamagishi means by "divide and rule." 
  Yamagishi explains the reason for his refusal to meet with 
Ozawa: "I am conducting legitimate self-defense against a 
surprise attack aimed at inducing the breakup of the SDPJ and at 
luring some of the right-wing members of the party. Moreover, 
if the cheerleader of the SDPJ meets with Ozawa, that will incur 
distrust." 
  However, he is very shrewd because he conveyed an unofficial 
message to the Ozawa side at the same time: "I am not saying 
that I will not meet with Ozawa." Yamagishi has not discarded 
"the Ozawa card," and Diet upper house member Sadao Hirano, a 
close aid to Ozawa, holds the view that the relationship between 
the two men is not thoroughly estranged. Hirano says: "The two 
men are fully aware of each other's political power. However, 
to think of the labor union is one thing, to think of Japan is 
another. When Ozawa had to make a decision under the 
restriction of time, that may have appeared too hasty to 
Yamagishi."

  [Text] Meanwhile, Ozawa, too, is conducting underground 
activities toward the LDP, holding "the Yamagishi card." 
  What has happened to the relationship between the two men 
since the SDPJ left the government? "Kaishin went so far as to 
expel the SDPJ. We are now on fighting terms with Ichi-Ichi 
[Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa]." 
  When such remarks by Yamagishi were leaked out to Nagata-cho 
[the center of Japan's politics], those who were looking forward 
to "a general election through the coalition of the LDP and the 
SDPJ under the multiseat constituency system" were encouraged, 
and SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama advocated "dissolution of 
the House of Representatives through mutual consent." 
  Meanwhile, Yamagishi was writing a different scenario, 
displaying "the LDP card." The plan was to push for 
resignation, through the pressure of Yuaikai, which is a pro-DSP 
[Democratic Socialist Party] labor union within Rengo, and DSP 
Chairman Keigo Ouchi, who took action to form "Kaishin." That 
was to shake Ozawa up and at the same time to pave the way for 
the SDPJ to return to the coalition government. Then, on 16 
May, Yamagishi said to DSP Dietman Eisei Ito and others, "The 
Hata administration will remain a minority government unless it 
resigns en masse and makes a fresh start." This remark was made 
five days before SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo made the 
same remark. 
  In opposition to Yamagishi's speech and conduct aiming at 
both "dissolution" and "returning the SDPJ to the coalition 
government," the general tendency within Rengo was against "the 
union between the LDP and the SDPJ." At the meeting of Rengo's 
Central Executive Committee, held on 19 May, all joined in to 
swell the chorus of calls for "a flat no to the union between 
the LDP and the SDPJ." Some leaders of Rengo testified that "the 
purpose of the meeting was to contain Yamagishi." It is not 
clear whether Ozawa moved behind the scenes. 
  Meanwhile, Ozawa's footing is no longer as firm as it used 
to 
be. Concerning the formation of "Kaishin" and the SDPJ's 
withdrawal from the coalition government, former Economic 
Planning Agency Director General Koichiro Aino, a leader of 
Shinseito, said, "Ozawa committed a gross blunder." 
  This is the first time that Ozawa was publicly criticized by 
name within Shinseito. On 19 May, Aino was released by Ozawa 
from the post of chief director of the Lower House's Committee 
on Rules and Administration. That night, Keiwa Okuda, chairman 
of the Lower House's Committee on Rules and Administration, is 
said to have said in excitement, "Why did Ozawa fire my 
right-hand man without prior consultation? I can never tolerate 
such a thing." Okuda is, in effect, the most influential man 
after Ozawa in Shinseito. Aino, who is Okuda's confident, says 
in a casual manner, "Ozawa the Terrible is the image made by the 
media. Younger members have ceased to be afraid of Ozawa 
because I do not fear him." 
  Now, on 26 May, the Political Reform Promotion Council [Ad 
Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform], consisting of members 
of business and labor, announced such emergency proposals as the 
"holding of a general election under the new system." In 
response to this, on the same day 88 supra-party Diet members, 
excepting members of the Japan Communist Party, became promoters 
and engaged in a signature-collecting campaign "against a 
general election under the current multiseat constituency 
system," which was to be completed by 10 June. At a press 
conference of the Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform, 
Professor Uchida and Rengo Acting Chairman Jinnosuke Ashida were 
present. It is said that it was DSP Secretary General Takashi 
Yonezawa who asked Washio to restore a good relationship between 
Ozawa and Yamagishi. Ashida is the top leader of Yuaikai which 
supports Yonezawa. Those who mediated for a meeting between 
Ozawa and Yamagishi are also advocates of political reform. 
  Ouchi expressed his intention to resign as chairman of the 
DSP on 1 June. Yonezawa, who had acted as a liaison in the 
formation of "Kaishin," was elected as the next chairman and 
Ouchi was made a scapegoat. On the following day, 2 June, at a 
meeting of Rengo's central committee, Yamagishi highly evaluated 
Ouchi's resignation, saying, "I hope that the SDPJ will present 
its political ideas and return to the non-LDP coalition 
government as soon as possible. 
  This can be construed to mean that Yamagishi has shown a 
sign 
for the restoration of a good relationship with Ozawa.

  [Text] The nuclear power subcommittee (whose chairman is 
Yoshihiko Morozumi, an adviser to the Electric Power Development 
Co.) of the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory organ to 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], 
released on 10 June an interim report proposing revisions to the 
nuclear cycle. The proposals included one for putting off 
operating a second reprocessing plant for extracting plutonium 
from spent nuclear fuel. The government's Atomic Energy 
Commission is presently working to revise its long-term plan to 
use nuclear power and on 22 June is planning to decide on 
revising the nuclear fuel cycle. The government's position -- 
which has been positive on using plutonium as a fuel made, in a 
sense, in Japan -- has greatly changed direction. 
  The subcommittee's report also takes into consideration the 
growing international concern regarding nuclear proliferation as 
the result of such issues as the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea's (North Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
In addition, the urgency of the plan to use plutonium has waned 
with the easing of the uranium supply, which has slowed down the 
plan. Concerning the nuclear fuel cycle, the report calls for 
expanding the production of enriched uranium to fuel nuclear 
reactors. On the other hand, the report postpones the planned 
second reprocessing plant, for which the plan until now had been 
to commence operations around the year 2010.

"Bureaucrats and the Coalition": "Lack of Progress in 
`Deregulation' and 'Decentralization'"] 
  [Text] On 13 May, the following conversation took place 
between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Daiei's Chairman and 
President Isao Nakauchi when he visited the prime minister's 
official residence bearing a Keidanren [Federation of Economic 
Organizations] petition for relaxation of government regulations. 
  [Prime Minister] "I need you to do what you can to eliminate 
the discrepancies between domestic and foreign prices." 
  [Nakauchi] "But the Finance Ministry is keeping an eye on us 
on beer [prices]." 
<H5>  Dissatisfaction With Lower Beer Prices </H5>
  On 14 April, Daiei reduced domestic beer prices by 7 
percent. 
Daiei has maintained its lowered retail prices despite the 1 May 
rise in the liquor tax, in what was a strong competitive blow to 
smaller and mid-sized liquor retail outlets. According to 
Nakauchi, the action even had reverberations within the Ministry 
of Finance's National Tax Administration Agency, which oversees 
the industry. 
  Officials of the National Tax Administration Agency's 
Alcoholic Beverage Tax Division maintain, "Beer is priced by 
open market forces. We cannot interfere." However, keeping 
prices low in the face of the division's instruction that the 
impact of increased taxes be passed on to the consumer certainly 
had to annoy the bureaucrats. Even though Nakauchi is 
championing the cause of lower prices as Keidanren's vice 
president in charge of administrative reforms, there are 
whispers in Kasumigaseki that "He is just trying to expand sales 
for his own retail operation." 
  "Last summer, large retail outlets of over 10,000 square 
meters in size were granted licenses through a special exemption 
clause. A further easing of regulations is uncalled for." On 
12 May, the day before Nakauchi met with the prime minister, the 
National Tax Administration Agency rejected seven separate 
petitions for deregulation on liquor sales at a session of the 
"Import Expansion, Improving Market Access and Distribution" 
working subcommittee of the Promotion Headquarters for 
Administrative Reform held at the prime minister's official 
residence. 
  At the working subcommittee session, eight government 
ministries and agencies concerned agreed to "take positive 
steps" on only two of the 71 proposals on the distribution 
sector made by a private sector hoping for deregulation. It was 
evident that in all areas, there is a deeply rooted resistance 
to any actual loosening of control. 
<H5>  Recommendations Outside Jurisdiction </H5>
  The passive attitude of the various government agencies 
toward deregulation has become more pronounced with the advent 
of the Hata administration. "To facilitate any easing of 
regulations, some guarantee of the political authorities' 
determination to immplement such measures is necessary, but that 
is improbable in the current situation where the budget is not 
even passed, " (a senior Ministry of Construction official) 
voiced cynical insight into the dubious footing of the minority 
coalition government. 
  In the midst of this, the machinations of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry are elaborately orchestrated. 
In 16 areas where it has no jurisdiction, such as in rice and 
liquor sales, the ministry presented a mid-May report 
recommending a sweeping easing of regulations. The senior 
officials of the ministry have even personally approached the 
working subcommittee's experts from academia and the business 
sector. 
  In lieu of offering a menu of choices to the experts and the 
prime minister, who are looking for impressive deregulation 
measures, the ministry has adopted a strategy to win acceptance 
of its own plan to "gradually ease regulations" under its 
jurisdiction, such as those embodied in the Large Retail Store 
Law. 
  However, inasmuch as deregulation is part of international 
commitments, the pressure for them nonetheless persists. In the 
final stage, the bureaucrats are inwardly prepared to table at 
least some minor deregulation measures as they stage a game of 
"awaiting the prime minister's political decision." 
  What the central government ministries and agencies 
vehemently oppose is the decentralization of government powers. 
<H5>  Finally Eviscerating the Legal Provisions </H5>
  "In the end, we had no choice but to compromise." So say 
Ministry of Home Affairs senior officials looking back on their 
struggle since January to liaise with other ministries and 
government bureaus in seeking to establish "regional 
amalgamation." 
  Regional amalgamation will be established by the amendment 
of 
the Local Government Act, enabling various prefectural-level 
governments or municipalities to work together on issues such as 
refuse disposal. The pillar of regional amalgamation was its 
ability to demand that the central government delegate authority. 
  However, the overwhelming resistance from the other 
ministries has resulted in the appendage of numerous provisions 
enhancing central government involvement to the proposed bill. 
In the final draft, requests to delegate authority can only be 
granted for "powers closely related to regional amalgamation." 
  The negotiations between the various ministries and agencies 
overlapped the final days of the Hosokawa administration and the 
birth of the Hata administration. Evidence of active leadership 
by the Prime Minister's Office was barely visible. 
  The issue of information disclosure is as prominent as the 
issue of decentralization. Koshiro lshida, director general of 
the Management and Coordination Agency, has recently started to 
emphasize that the proposed reforms will be "the most sweeping 
reforms in half a century." Nobuyoshi Namikawa, secretary 
general of the People's Conference on Administrative Reform, is 
worried: "That is what bureaucrats say when they mean, `We are 
not going to make this easy'."

Land Agency: "Revive Japanese Economy Through Creativity; The 
Key Is Improved Productivity"] 
  [Text] When Japan's productivity per unit-time is 
compared with Europe and the United States, it ranks the lowest. 
There is no future for Japan's economy without overcoming its 
low productivity. How can the productivity be raised? This 
writer proposes not the TQC [total quality control] which led 
Japan's postwar economy to success, but TPC [total productivity, 
creativity encouragement], which is a newly coined term that 
appeals for the formation of a high system of creativity. 
<H5>  Low Labor Productivity </H5>
  Japan's economy today may be said to be in considerably 
serious circumstances compared with other postwar periods. It is 
caused by high costs of manufacturing and low productivities of 
the service industries. Without surmounting them, there can be 
no medium or long-term breakthrough for Japan's economy. The 
only solution is to raise the per-hour productivity per worker. 
  In Japan's case, growth rate of its workers and average 
annual total work hours by the workers are gradually declining. 
In order to increase the gross domestic product [GDP], it is 
necessary to raise the productivity beyond offsetting the 
decline. 
  When the unit-time productivity per worker is compared with 
major nations of Europe and the United States (OECD purchasing 
power, parity-base), the trend is gradually upward, it still 
remains in the lowest position. Conversely, the annual total 
work hours are the longest among the major nations. Moreover, 
the commuting time is also the longest. 
  The Japan's livelihood-related asset-and-service price level 
is said to be high internationally and that is partly because of 
its high land prices. However, the fundamental factor is its low 
productivity. It is also because of the low rate of 
capitalization for informationalization of the POS [point of 
sale] system and the EOS [supplementary ordering system]. In 
addition, although the productivity of manufacturing industries 
is considerably higher than tertiary industries, it is low 
compared to major Western nations except for a portion of the 
production workplaces. The reasons are: long work hours, 
substantively low wages followed by high service costs for 
distribution, and excessive indirect personnel. 
  In any case, with the bubble era as a watershed, Japan's 
manufacturing industries once viewed as the world's top find 
themselves in dire circumstances because of high costs stemming 
from surplus plant-and-equipment and personnel, a sharp drop in 
demand, and the impact of a high yen, in addition to 
dissemination in the West of production methods once considerd 
as Japan's forte. 
  The point of economic structural reform is how to minimize 
the gap between the purchasing power parity (currently about $1 
= 190 yen) and the foreign exchange rate. For example, assuming 
that the purchasing power parity is $1 = 150 yen, Japan's 
productivity will rise by slightly under 30 percent to reach 
above 90 percent of the U.S. productivity. Methods to reduce 
the gap are as follows: 1) Promote import of livelihood assets, 
materials, and parts by utilizing the high yen, 2) reverse 
import of finished products and parts by shifting production 
overseas, 3) avoid high-yen pressures by reducing the current 
account surplus, and 4) improve productivity in the service 
industries and the manufacturing industries. Both 1 and 2 have 
been implemented in the past and will probably accelerate in the 
future. As a result, they will be tied to 3. The formidable 
task is how to improve productivity in 4. 
<H5>  Reexamination of Labor Practices </H5>
  Consequently, the way of living, labor practices, commercial 
practices, and corporate practices of the Japanese people must 
change. These tasks have become possible under the changes in 
current circumstances that include a torrid international 
economic environment, a rebellion by consumers, and the changes 
in value concepts of the Japanese people. 
  The changes in value concepts of the Japanese are rooted in 
a 
desire for freedom (liberation from shackles), a desire for 
friendship and association, and a rise in "self first." They 
appear from the standpoint of youths, for example, as a 
decreasing desire to belong to an organization (a rise of those 
desiring change in employment and those changing employment), 
changes in life outlook (manifesting one's own abilities as a 
part of life as contrasted to working as a company person, 
emphasis on a lifestyle to suit one's tastes), an increase among 
males with emphasis on the home, leisure time as a priority in 
one's livelihood, greater weight on leisure and sports, and 
enhanced concern about health and environment. 
  Modernization of awareness and value concepts among the 
Japanese is thus moving forward. However, individual needs that 
emanate from such value concepts are still not satisfied. 
According to a public opinion poll, reasons for dissatisfaction 
regarding leisure activities include a lack of everyday free 
time or a lack of extended vacations and holidays. The energy 
spent toward fulfilling those needs could provide momentum for 
improvement of unit-time productivity and a major change in the 
domestic-type industrial structure. 
  How do we organically combine "self-realization," "authority 
and responsibility," "tension and release," "power of 
concentration," "creativity," and "approach to the consumer" to 
organize a highly creative system? Among the component elements 
of productivity, how do we compress the ratio of personnel 
costs, and how do we enhance values (profits) based on 
creativity? What must we do concretely to improve corporate 
creativity? The principal directions are as follows: 
  1) Streamline the upper echelons of the management sector 
through staff minimization and thus form a strong leadership 
abounding in creativity. Management must detect the deep and 
true currents and focus on the people, return to the point of 
origin of the organization, indicate directions and visions, and 
resolutely implement bold operational reforms from within in 
order to boost creativity. 
  2) Strengthen planning and R&amp;D capabilities. For this 
purpose, a climate of utilizing and nurturing workers of 
superior talent and innovation is demanded. 
  3) Simplify and shorten decisionmaking processes within the 
organization. Respond swiftly by reducing unnecessary checks and 
controls and by clarifying responsible persons without having 
them lean on each other. 
  4) Transfer authority to subordinates and persons in charge, 
or to subsidiaries, plants, and responsible sectors. Although 
this will incur greater responsibility, it will also invoke 
greater initiative and volition. 
  5) Emphasize results through work evaluation. For the 
intellectual workers, "creativity" through "concentration" is 
the decisive factor between success and failure regardless of 
the time factor. A fair evaluation of the results inspires 
morale and creates a favorable cycle in producing further 
favorable results. 
  6) Shorten the sales channels, and unify manufacture and 
sales. Swift response will be possible through reduction of 
distribution costs and understanding of needs of the consumers 
and clients. 
  7) Promote reduction of work hours. Recreation is 
indispensable for creativity, and it is important to provide an 
environment and work arrangement by utilizing paid vacations 
which tend to be underused. 
  8) Use information machines and instruments effectively and 
develop software. Not only can it provide efficient and improved 
standard business affairs through concentrated management, but 
it will also facilitate intellectual support for non-standard 
business affairs and a systematic networking of individual 
knowledge. 
<H5>  Enhancement of Morale </H5>
  These measures help to encourage individuals to respond to 
the trends of the times such as decentralization of authority, 
individualization, and independence. It is also important to 
conduct a general check of the production process which is the 
source of a strong manufacturing industry whether any problems 
exist including the morale of workers. Also, while reengineering 
has recently been in the limelight, its popularity is conversely 
accompanied by a sense of anxiety. It is necessary to pay full 
attnetion to the following points. First, the terminology is not 
appropriate, and it carries a strong inorganic sense of emphasis 
on information machines and equipment and less emphasis on 
humans. Second, because of the emphasis on improving medium and 
long-term efficiency, the medium- and long-term research themes 
tend to be overlooked. Third, the United States has inherently 
been strong in creativity and stresses elimination of waste. 
  Today half a century after the World War II, the Japanese 
are 
enjoying material affluence and are finally beginning to move 
toward mental freedom. The companies and organizations comprised 
of such Japanese find it necessary to devise various 
organizational schemes to bring out maximum use of potential 
talent while considering the independence, sense of 
self-sufficiency, and fulfillment of the workers. This is not an 
idealistic theory. In fact, the companies that are prospering 
despite the major recession have and are implementing a new 
sense of management concept. A representative example is as 
follows. 
  Company A (a chemical company with partial listing, less 
than 
1,000 employees) is improving its productivity while increasing 
its profits and continues to boost its earnings/profits. 
Compared to the overall manufacturing industry, its 
capitalization and profit rate are also high. In addition, it is 
coping aggressively with reduction of work hours. In order to 
encourage planned cutbacks in overtime and use of vacations, 
with the promotion of thorough analysis of each worker's duties 
and office automation, the annual total work hours last year was 
slightly above l,830 hours or about 130 hours less than the 
manufacturing industry as a whole. Incidentally, the per 
unit-time productivity in FY92 was about 50 percent above the 
overall manufacturing industry. 
  The secret of its progress is a powerful leadership with 
high 
creativity, a client-oriented management posture, high worker 
morale based on transfer of authority to those in charge, 
thorough pragmatism and efforts to reduce costs (the sales 
plateau price-ratio dropped about five points in the past five 
years and fell below the 50-percent level), capability to 
develop new products through emphasis on R&amp;D, and unity of 
manufacturing and sales. In addition, it should be specially 
pointed out that about a quarter of all its employees were 
deployed with priority in the R&amp;D and new project sectors 
following an overall reexamination of business affairs and 
expansion of information systems. These aspects are generally 
held in common in other smoothly operating companies. 
  Japan's economy as a whole lags far behind Europe and the 
United States. We should work to create new industries with high 
productivity, centering on the so-called service industries in 
the developing stage. It is important to thus elevate overall 
productivity. Furthering the services and software aspects of 
the economy will be inevitable in the future. Development in 
advanced tertiary industries which provide high-level services 
at relatively low prices must be promoted in a diversified range 
of personal needs including health, medical care, leisure time 
and activities, sports, shopping, academic studies, and safety. 
  These areas have recently expanded their market scale. For 
example, sales in areas close at home such as home-nursing care, 
bathing services, baby-sitting, "karaoke" boxes, TV games 
(particularly software), general sports facilities, cultural 
classrooms, and security services have grown markedly. Also 
drastic modal changes are taking place in retail industries. 
With new types of convenience stores and discount stores as 
their engines, overall productivity is rising and employment is 
expanding. A proper environment to promote such trends is 
necessary. In other words, in addition to reexamination of the 
regulations, it is urgent that we strengthen and expand such 
infrastructures as advanced information and communications, 
livelihood, transportation, and research, and support pioneers. 
It is also important to utilize the foreign capital and the 
wisdom of foreigners who have advanced into these areas. The 
National Land Agency is currently following up the 4th national 
general development plan and the capital region basic plan 
drafted in the late 1980's and is reviewing them with care. 
<H5>  Recommendation of TPC </H5>
  The development of advanced tertiary industries is also 
linked to the revival of manufacturing industries. This is 
because reduction of service costs that depend on the outside, 
the supply of high-value capital assets and systems, and 
participation in new businesses based on the use of superior 
human resources become feasible. 
  Japan as a whole forms a well-balanced chain from 
"productivity improvement per unit-time" and "promotion of 
reduced work hours (raise of hourly pay)" to "increase of free 
time" to "fulfilment of personal needs." In other words, if 
reform on the supplier side progresses, the conditions to 
satisfy personal needs on the consumer side are in order. That 
is, the aim is to "work (study) well, and play well." 
  It means that "productivity improvement per unit-time" 
contributes not only to competitiveness and growth of Japan's 
economy but also to expansion of domestic demand by satisfying 
personal needs and to change in the domestic demand-type of 
industrial structure. We would like to call the series of 
measures for productivity improvement per unit-time toward these 
targets TPC [total productivity, creativity encouragement] after 
Japan's once-successful TQC [total quality control]. Perhaps now 
is the time to boost a TPC movement among the people nationwide, 
focusing on the organizational managment aspects of individual 
awareness, behavior, and enterprise.

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Akio Yamamoto, reporter of </F>
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Tokyo Securities Department: "Growing Risk 
of Personnel Liabilities"] 
<H5>  [13 Apr 94 p 17] </H5>
  [Text] Companies have begun facing the problems of 
"labor liabilities" such as retirement benefits and pensions for 
their employees. With their employment adjustments, payments to 
those retiring are growing sharply and generating huge special 
losses. Until now, they have gotten by somehow by disposing of 
assets or borrowing from banks, but there is no guarantee that 
those methods will work indefinitely. It is time to pay the 
piper for the contradictions of lifetime employment and the 
seniority pay system that had been put off to the future. 
<H5>  Companies That Have Been Lucky </H5>
  Since the end of 1993, president Kenji Kano of the big 
software developer INES has repeatedly been told, "I want to 
know why you have cut your staff back so much." 
  In November 1993 the company sought voluntary resignations 
and 302 persons responded. Before that 250 people had resigned 
for their own reasons, and by the start of the first quarter of 
1994, one-fourth of its staff of 2,067 had left the company. 
  The reason such a large staff cutback possible is that 
average employee age is a young 30 years. Employees who resigned 
were mainly those in their 20's who had been with the company 
two to four years. Including bonuses, total payments for 
resignation allowances came to 1.44 billion yen (2.6 million yen 
per person). One can see how light that burden was if it is 
compared to the total of 3.6 billion yen (12.2 million yen per 
person) that Shokusan Jutaku Sogo Co., Ltd. paid last June after 
soliciting 250 voluntary resignations among those mainly in 
their 50's. 
  It was also lucky that much of the 14.3 billion yen procured 
in a publicly offered new stock issue in March 1990 still 
remained as current deposits and had not been put into 
facilities investment under the business recession followed 
immediately. 
  Listed firms that have cut staff by more than 100 by 
soliciting voluntary resignations exceeded 20 in fiscal year 
1993 alone, but few companies covered resignation bonuses from 
funds on hand as INES did. Even in the software industry, where 
it is said that "some 10 percent of employees have no work," 
making up funds for resignation bonuses is a bottleneck and one 
sees no firms resolutely cutting back staff. 
  How do companies that have solicited voluntary resignations 
usually cope with the financial aspects? A typical example of 
that is Tamura Electric Works, Ltd., which solicited voluntary 
resignations in the summer of 1992. 
  This company paid out a total of 7 billion yen to 698 
persons 
resigning voluntarily (36 percent of its total staff). To cope 
with this, it raised 3 billion yen by selling off land, golf 
course memberships, and borrowed the remainder from a number of 
banks including its main-force Fuji Bank. 
  The handling for accounting purposes is that 3 billion yen 
in 
normal resignation bonuses is written off as resignation payroll 
reserves. The extra 4 billion yen in resignation bonuses is 
counted as a special loss, taking the form of a partial covering 
of losses by extra profits from the asset disposal gain. 
  Ordinary resignation fund reserves, which are an item on 
balance sheets, also have not actually been secured as funds on 
hand. Therefore, says General Affairs Division Chief Minoru 
Takahashi, it was necessary that "with deciding to solicit 
voluntary resignations, our officers went around" seeking the 
cooperation of the banks at the same time. 
  Denki Kagaku Kogyo, which October 1993 solicited voluntary 
resignations (382 persons), and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing, 
which made a solicitation January 1994 (297 persons), procured 
their resignation bonus funds--2.2 and 1.8 billion yen 
respectively--by selling off idle assets and getting the banks' 
cooperation. 
<H5>  Hard To Borrow From Banks </H5>
  Lately, cases have begun emerging in which companies are 
being forced to do last-resort fund procurement to pay 
resignation bonuses. To cover the procurement for, and special 
losses accompanying its solicitation of 178 voluntary 
resignations, Orient Watch Co., Ltd. sold off its main factory 
in Hino City, Tokyo, March 1994. It sold its storage area, 
amounting to one-third of its acreage to Seiko-Epson, its 
number-two stockholder, for over 3.1 billion yen (a disposal 
gain of 2.9 billion yen), and by leasing this back it has 
continued operations. The company holds 5 billion yen of its 
stock by book value, but as of late September 1993 was holding 
1.7 billion yen in latent losses. Even as it defers personnel 
adjustments, its asset value is dropping and a company executive 
says, "In a situation where we have no prospect for earnings 
recovery, it is hard to borrow even from banks." 
  There are more companies which, separately from the firms' 
own finances, hold in trust as "pensions" the funds for needed 
for future resignation bonuses. Yet, the problem of operating 
stagnation even in company pensions is quite onerous. The totals 
for company pensions grow year by year and had reached a scale 
of 50 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993. However, if 
adjusted for market price, some 2.8 trillion yen is gone with 
the wind due to the effects of stock-price stagnation. 
<H5>  If Environment Deteriorates... </H5>
  Nagasakiya Co., Ltd., whose unprecedentedly expensive 
resignation bonuses were so much discussed, seems currently to 
be carrying latent losses close to 10 percent in qualified 
pensions accumulating to 19 billion yen. With a total of some 10 
billion yen in resignation funds, including pensions, to be 
disbursed by 17 April [1994], the company will be drawing down 
over 2 billion yen in pension assets. But it is also possible 
that it will force loss- cutting on its stock, and if it tries 
to avoid that, its latent loss would expand even more. 
  Although a glimmer of light has become visible in the 
business climate, few forecast a rapid recovery in business 
earnings. It even seems likely that there will be more 
corporations unable to come back without restructuring that 
includes employment adjustments. Unprepared firms are raising 
the funds after undergoing great difficulty, but if the 
environment worsens, it may even become an actual matter of not 
meeting "labor liabilities." 
<H5>  [14 Apr 94 p 17] </H5>
  [Text] In the December quarter of 1993, Japan IBM 
effected a personnel reduction of some 3,000 persons, amounting 
to over a 10 percent of its whole staff. Its total payout of 
resignation funds, including the portion for pensions, is 
unknown; but under special losses in the name of resignation 
funds, it tallied 45 billion yen. This is mainly payments of 
extra retirement bonuses and payments to employees under 50 
years of age who are not eligible for qualified pensions. 
<H5>  "Total Amount From Current Deposits" </H5>
  Its allowances for resignation bonuses are under the same 
dual system as other Japanese firms: resignation payment 
reserves and pensions. "We are guided by our parent company in 
the United States and do the management of resignation expenses 
strictly, having kept a setup for covering the total amount by 
drawing it down from current deposits," says Katsunori Asakura, 
deputy chief for financial fund planning. The company made no 
asset sales in the previous quarter, and its long- and 
short-term debts are being reduced so that it takes the form of 
internal procurement which copes by making a 35.7 billion yen 
cut in inventory. 
  In general, U.S. firms have larger allowances for 
resignation 
expenses than Japanese firms. the U.S. Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) requires for fixed-benefit type pensions 
that differences between the current valuation of pension assets 
and the amount payable, which estimates future pay raises also, 
be accounted as that quarter's pension expenses. When the actual 
contributed amount exceeds the pension expenses in the account, 
the difference is added to assets as a prepaid expense. 
Conversely, when a sum less than pension expenses is 
contributed, the shortfall is added to liabilities as an unpaid 
expense. In corporate accounting, obligations to employees are 
actively maintained. 
  When Japanese firms make employment adjustments, one reason 
for their cash position troubles is their inadequate 
accumulation of resignation payment reserves. Certified public 
accountant Ikuo Nishikawa criticizes that inadequacy, saying, 
"Japanese resignation expense reserves do not make a projected 
calculation using actuarial statistics but have merely gone back 
to current values under a set discount rate for the sum needed 
for payment at quarter's end." 
  In actuality, too, there are many companies which adopt, as 
is, the tax law standard that accepts as a loss up to 40 percent 
of the amount to be paid at quarter's end. This is calculated by 
postulating the sum to be paid should all employees resign at 
the end of a certain quarter with 12 years of remaining service, 
discounted at a rate of 8 percent. The possibility is high that 
accumulations will be inadequate simply from not considering 
such things as future pay increases. 
  Limitations have also been pointed to in the aspect of 
securing funds accumulated in readiness for future payments. 
Professor Aishi Imafuku of Nihon University says, "The funds 
reserved are directed into one investment or another; and, with 
reductions in the investment value of land or stocks, instances 
are emerging of the basic assets of resignation funds becoming 
inadequate." 
  Managing Director Yoichi Sugimoto of the Japan Securities 
Industry Welfare Pension Fund, controlling the pension assets 
for some 150,000 persons working in securities firms, asserts, 
"The biggest issue for Japan's company pensions is asset 
management by book value." Not a few pension funds even carry 
latent losses. 
  Over the past several years, U.S. companies have tallied 
huge 
deficits and pushed forward with bold restructuring. The U.S. 
IBM's fourth-quarter 1992 operating deficit was about $8.2 
billion and its final deficit for the year went above $4.9 
billion while its costs related to restructuring rose to $11.6 
billion. 
  It effected staff cuts of 32,000 persons, equivalent to 
nearly 10 percent of its total work force. Its supplementary 
resignation costs covering extra resignation funds were $2.3 
billion and totalled $5.4 billion when the share due in the 
following fiscal year are included. Yet, its pension expenses 
were $838 million, growing by no more than just over $300 
million above the previous quarter. It is a big contrast to the 
dire distress which Japanese firms go through even in paying out 
ordinary resignation funds. 
<H5>  Great Difference Between Japan and the United States </H5>
  Where Japan differs greatly from the United States is not 
merely in the sense of obligations owed to employees and their 
security. For the size of liabilities a firm will carry forward 
into the future, its liabilities still to be accumulated for 
pensions and its expenses in a period are vital information for 
investors, but in Japan these are not adequately disclosed. 
  In the United States, not only are shortfalls in 
accumulations of pension assets added into the balance sheets, 
but such items as the market value of pension assets and pension 
expenses are also entered. In statements of cash-flow accounts, 
cash appropriated for pension funds is disclosed. In Japan, once 
an appropriation is made to a pension fund outside of the 
company, it becomes an off-the-book asset and only the book 
value of pension assets is disclosed. Pension expenses also are 
lumped together as legal welfare expenses and become unknown to 
anyone on the outside. 
  The Hitachi, Ltd.'s total of pension assets and resignation 
payment allocations as of the end of March 1993 was about 725 
billion yen. That differs greatly from the approximately 570 
billion yen at Toshiba, where the scale of staffing and average 
age are not very different. On the grounds that "We have no 
obligation to disclose it," expenses for the quarter are not 
revealed; however, cumulatively a gap in expenses of about 150 
billion yen would have existed in the past. 
<H5>  Era for Deferrals Is Passing </H5>
  The era is passing in which under the systems of lifetime 
employment and seniority wages premising a high growth rate 
firms could defer expenses, and the need is growing to set up 
conditions for corporate ratings that even allow global 
comparisons. The issue of "labor liabilities," while subsuming 
complex elements tied to the social system, is a topic that 
makes it urgently necessary to take up a clarification of the 
obligations and security measures that companies owe their 
employees as well as disclosure of information to 
investors.

<F P=106> [Article by Tsutomu Yamaguchi from Washington; part one of </F>
three-part series entitled "North Korea's Suspected Development 
of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure: The United States Is 
Becoming Restless at the Stalemate"; first paragraph is YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
development of nuclear arms has suddenly been launched into even 
greater confusion with the DPRK's unexpected replacement of fuel 
rods from its experimental nuclear reactor. The focal issue 
will now be what will come out of multilateral discussions at 
the UN Security Council, apart from how North Korea, which 
maintains a confrontational attitude toward the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime led by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), will behave from now on. Will the UN discussions 
lead to a breakthrough in the situation or will they lead to an 
even more dangerous direction? Let us look at the structure of 
this crisis, including how Japan is coping with the situation. 
  "Since June last year, we have carried on negotiations with 
the DPRK, with patience and flexibility. But the question was 
returned to the UN Security Council because the DPRK had 
destroyed the basis for the IAEA to determine how much plutonium 
had been diverted." On 3 June, the IAEA reported to the UN 
secretary general that the inspection of the fuel rods became 
impossible. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci 
(special envoy on North Korean nuclear matters) held a news 
conference and his face reflected fatigue and disappointment. 
He was on record only a week ago making public a prospect that 
the third-round of high level talks with the DPRK might be held 
in early June. It was going to be a successful overcoming of 
domestic hawks' criticism of "appeasement." 
  At that third-round of talks, the assistant secretary of 
state said both countries were scheduled "to talk over the total 
settlement of the nuclear problem and the problems related to 
normalization of relations between the two countries." Was it 
not what the DPRK nuclear diplomacy intended -- bringing the 
U.S. Government to the negotiating table by declaring its 
intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] in March last year? 
  At this vital time, why did the DPRK dare to remove fuel 
rods 
from a reactor? Although what had happened behind the scenes 
was shrouded in mystery, the assistant secretary of state's 
words sounded as though he was greatly mortified. Well-informed 
people in the United States are now divided into two groups in 
their interpretation of the suspected DPRK nuclear arms 
development program with which the DPRK has been playing with 
the United States, a super power. One is the nuclear card theory 
that the DPRK is using the suspicion itself as an allurement to 
win the largest possible compromise out of the West. Another is 
an argument that the DPRK is attempting to establish military 
predominance in the region and to get economic as well as 
diplomatic compromises by eventually possessing a nuclear 
capability. 
  The six policy options mentioned in a report titled "The 
North Korean Nuclear Program and U.S. Government Policy Options" 
published on 1 June by the Congressional Research Service 
strongly reflect polarization of views on the DPRK. While the 
first option says to await the collapse of the Pyongyang regime, 
which cannot survive until the DPRK's nuclear capability becomes 
a serious threat, the second option suggests a policy of making 
a package settlement of the problems pertaining to the Korean 
peninsula and it has become the basis of the foreign policy the 
Clinton administration has pursued so far. 
  The third option is about the UN-imposed economic sanctions 
now under hot debate. These sanctions are anticipated when 
diplomatic efforts mentioned in the second option fail. 
  The remaining choices are related to military options: the 
fourth suggests reinforcement of the U.S. military presence in 
the Korean peninsula, including redeployment of tactical nuclear 
weapons and the fifth contains a tough proposal to launch 
limited attacks on the suspected nuclear facilities. The fifth 
was exactly what hawkish Republican Senator John McCain had 
proposed in a letter to the President late last month. It may 
be difficult to get the support of Japan and the Republic of 
Korea, who do not in earnest wish to intensify tension in the 
Korean peninsula situation, for the fourth and fifth options. 
  As a result, the report insists on a sixth option, a gradual 
withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK. It amounts to an 
abandonment of mission and the East Asian stability centered 
around the Korean peninsula will be greatly harmed. 
  The congressional report that dared to mention "abandonment" 
as the last option most eloquently reflects the irritation and 
the state of running out in countermeasures on the U.S. 
Government's part. 
  Now the situation is heading toward the third option -- UN 
imposed sanctions, but President Clinton on his European tour 
said: "There is still time to avoid UN sanctions," indicating 
his wish to avoid stepping into the unpredictable next phase. 
  Since its start, the Clinton administration has pursued 
diplomacy based on three pillars -- human rights, economic 
security, and nuclear nonproliferation. But, the human rights 
diplomacy suffered a big setback by extending the 
most-favored-nation treatment to China and economic security has 
not yielded any conspicuous success. For Clinton's diplomacy, 
the last fortress is nuclear nonproliferation for which a talk 
is scheduled next spring to negotiate whether the NPT should be 
reexamined or unconditionally extended. 
  There is no guarantee that the DPRK would make a compromise, 
even if the U.S. Government succeeded in getting support on 
imposing the UN sanctions. It will not be long before President 
Clinton has to make a painful decision whether to defend the 
last fortress or to pull back.

<F P=106> [Article by Takushi Kawada from Seoul; part two of </F>
three-part series entitled "North Korea's Suspected Development 
of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure: Involvement of the 
United States, China, Russia, and Japan Deepens"] 
  [TEXT] On 6 June, the United States, the Republic of 
Korea, and Japan conferred in Washington on the DPRK's nuclear 
question, and an old general abruptly left Pyongyang for 
Beijing. He is 75-year-old Choe Kwang, chief of the general 
staff of the People's Army and a member of the party Politburo. 
During World War II, he was said to have engaged in partisan 
resistance activities with President Kim Il-song and at present 
he ranks ninth in the hierarchy. Choe immediately went into 
talks with his Chinese counterpart and extolled "friendship 
between China and the DPRK." 
  In the evening of 7 June, the following day, ROK President 
Kim Yong-sam deplaned at a military air base in Seoul after an 
official visit of Russia and read a statement: "Russia pledged 
resolute measures to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear 
arms." 
  Only in the Korean peninsula does serious confrontation 
continue after the end of the Cold War. As suspicion over the 
nuclear arms development program is getting more serious, brisk 
activities are going on in the four neighboring [word as 
published] countries -- the United States, China, Russia, and 
Japan. Both South and North Korea are all out to work on China 
and Russia and heated behind-the-scenes negotiations are going 
on at such organizations as the UN Security Council. On 8 June, 
ROK Foreign Minister Han Song-ju will arrive in Beijing and 
Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa will visit Seoul and Beijing 
over the weekend. 
  "The Korea peninsula has once more become an arena of 
rivalry 
among the peripheral four powers. South and North Korea joined 
the United Nations simultaneously three years ago, pledging 
coexistence in their basic agreement, but the nuclear problem 
has completely changed the picture." So said with a sigh North 
Korean affairs specialist Kim Nam-shik, fellow at the Peace 
Study Institute in Seoul, comparing the present situation with 
that of the Yi Dynasty. 
  In the later 19th century, the Korea peninsula, China, 
Czarist Russia, and Japan were rivals for rights and interests 
and Japan colonized Korea after the Sino-Japanese and the 
Russo-Japanese wars. It is needless to say the present situation 
is different from that of those days when imperialism was 
rampant. But fellow Kim pointed out: "Although what matters 
today is nuclear, not the territory, the resembling situation is 
that the peripheral powers are stepping up their influence over 
the Korean peninsula for their own security and interests." 
  As the forefront of East-West confrontation during the Cold 
War days, the Korean peninsula maintained a confrontational but 
stabilized situation in two distinct camps -- North Korea 
supported by China and the Soviet Union and South Korea with the 
backing of the United States and Japan. 
  Following the Cold War's end, the ROK normalized relations 
with the former Soviet Union and China, tipping the power 
balance over the Korean peninsula in one breath. 
  At one time, the South and North sought to construct a 
unique 
order of coexistence but the DPRK finally chose a way to use the 
suspected nuclear arms development program as the means to get a 
U.S. guarantee indispensable "for the maintenance of the present 
order on equal terms." As a result, the United States was 
compelled to further its involvement in the Korean peninsula and 
China, Russia, and Japan became strongly concerned due to 
further complication of the nuclear matters. 
  From this viewpoint, the situation in the Korean peninsula 
can be described as a grandiose diplomatic war between the South 
and North and the Big Four to build a new order of stability in 
the peninsula with the nuclear problem as their keyword. 
  The United States is steadily making preparations for when 
sanctions may be imposed with the cooperation of Japan and the 
ROK with a proposition of "nuclear nonproliferation." But the 
positive fact that must not be overlooked is that none of the 
parties, South and North Korea, the United States, China, 
Russia, or Japan, want sanctions imposed. It is their true 
intention to evade the situation that goes against building a 
new order. 
  According to diplomatic sources, the present position of the 
United States, the ROK, and Japan that they would "impose 
sanctions if necessary" is a policy to apply pressure on the 
DPRK to become more flexible and it is thought to be a 
considerably long time before actual sanctions would take place. 
How are South and North Korea and the four other nations going 
to deal with the dangerous factor of nuclear problems and of 
building a new stability? The DPRK will not easily abandon the 
nuclear card unless it is confident of its survival. 
  Well-informed sources in North Korean affairs predicted the 
future development this way: "DPRK President Kim Il-song is not 
embarrassed at all. Rather, he is indignant with the United 
States for the `nonfulfillment of promises.' There is a good 
reason to believe that the Pyongyang leadership will look for a 
new logic to make compromises on the nuclear inspection and 
shift its position for dialogue, while consolidating readiness 
to undergo preliminary sanctions. On the other hand, it is 
conceivable that it may seek a new solution through the octonary 
negotiation [as proposed by Russia]." They added, "The current 
situation is different from ideological confrontation during the 
Cold War. It poses another problem that crisis may be amplified 
by complex interests of the countries involved."

  [Text] In response to the DPRK (North Korea) announcement 
on its immediate withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), a government source said on 14 June that the 
government had begun to review its stance toward UN Security 
Council [UNSC] resolutions. The Japanese Government has been 
taking a moderate attitude toward North Korea, calling for a 
UNSC warning before imposing any sanctions. However, some 
quarters in the government are calling for stronger actions to 
cope with North Korea's high-handed attitude. The government 
has reportedly started consulting the United States and the ROK 
to jointly urge the UNSC to adopt immediate sanctions. 
  On the same day, a top Foreign Ministry official hinted at a 
change in Japan's stance toward UNSC resolutions, saying: 
"Japan has been calling for step-by-step sanctions beginning 
with a warning by the UNSC, but this does not mean Japan wants 
to disturb the efforts of the international community." In 
addition, a Foreign Ministry source said stronger sanctions are 
likely to be imposed: "The UNSC may include Japan's ban on 
remittances to North Korea from the first stage." In that case, 
the government will face a difficult situation since the 
remittance ban is expected to arouse much controversy in Japan. 
  To cope with the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan, the 
United States, and the ROK held working-level talks in 
Washington on 4 June. Moreover, U.S. Under Secretary of State 
for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff visited Japan and the ROK 
from 10 to 11 June to finalize a motion to be submitted to the 
UNSC. 
  The Japanese Government has been insisting that UNSC 
sanctions be implemented moderately on a step-by-step basis, 
since impatient measures would obtain support from neither China 
nor the Japanese public. In line with the moderate policy, 
Japan requested the UNSC issue a warning against North Korea 
prior to imposing sanctions. 
  The United States and the ROK initially showed consideration 
for Japan's position, and agreed to jointly seek step-by-step 
sanctions. Yet the two nations then showed slightly different 
positions, calling for a UNSC decision on suspension of 
technological aid and cultural exchanges by the United Nations, 
rather than bans on remittances or oil exports. 
  Following North Korea's announcement of its immediate 
withdrawal from the IAEA, the United States and the ROK have 
assumed a firm attitude. In a phone call with Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa on the morning of 14 June, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher hinted at a U.S. policy to strengthen the 
UNSC resolution, saying: "We may have to reconsider our proposal 
to the UNSC."

  [Text] On the prospect of UN disciplinary measures 
regarding the DPRK's (North Korea) announcement to secede from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa said at the 14 June House of Councilors' Budget 
Committee meeting: "I think it will be economic sanctions." He 
then said: "Some people have an apprehension that the phased and 
gradual measures, which we proposed, may be shortened. We hope 
that North Korea will understand the international community's 
stance and will not launch hasty countermeasures." He made 
these remarks in a response to a question by Fujio Saito of the 
Liberal Democratic Party.

  [Text] At the upper house Budget Committee session on 14 
June, Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda expressed a 
positive stance toward introduction of the Theater Missile 
Defense (TMD) System. 
  In response to questions by Councillors Taizo Nozawa and 
Fumio Saito on Japan's defense system to counter threats from 
the DPRK's (North Korea) "Nodong-1" missiles, Kanda said: "We 
do not presently have an adequate defense system. We must have 
some sort of large-scale air defense system, such as the TMD." 
  The United States is planning to develop the TMD with the 
participation of Japan and other nations; and, at the Japan-U.S. 
security talks in March, foreign and defense ministers of the 
two nations agreed to "continue talks" on whether Japan should 
join the project. However, the Japanese Government has not so 
far determined its official policy on the project.

  [Text] Commenting on the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor 
Agreement that is due to be reviewed at the end of July, a 
senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] said on 13 June, "The Japanese Government will 
not seek to repeal the agreement." His comment made clear that 
the Japanese Government plans to keep the agreement in effect 
without review until the end of July 1996. Japan and the United 
States are set to hold regular talks on the agreement for two 
days beginning 15 June in Tokyo. 
  The agreement, which was concluded between Japan and the 
United States in August 1991, is effective for five years. The 
agreement carries a provision that requires the two countries to 
"review whether to repeal it or not" at the end of July 1994. 
The agreement sets a 20 percent share of foreign-made 
semiconductors in the Japanese chip market as the target of 
effort. Japan has deeply repented concluding the agreement with 
the United States, claiming that the target of effort has been 
exploited by the United States as a numerical target. 
  For that reason, Japan has long thought of insisting on an 
early repeal of the agreement, but there is a strong view within 
MITI that, with the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
just resumed, "Japan cannot argue with the United States over 
another sticky trade issue." 
  Though the Japanese Government has decided to keep the 
agreement in effect, the same senior MITI official made it clear 
that the Japanese Government will seek to repeal the agreement 
at the end of July 1996 when it expires, saying, "The agreement 
will not be extended after the end of July 1996."

  [Text] A team, which includes Governor Ota, that is 
visiting the United States to demand a resolution on the issues 
of bases in Okinawa ended its activities in Hawaii on the 
morning of 12 June (at dawn on 13 June, Japan time) and is 
heading for the U.S. mainland. The team extracted from the 
commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii a partial 
abolishment of the training across Okinawa Prefecture's Route 
104. On the issue of the naval port in Naha, rough going was 
indicated for specifying a place to move it. The team is facing 
bright prospects and thick walls. The stage for negotiations is 
moving to Washington, where attention is focusing on whether the 
team will be able to gain concrete answers from the State and 
Defense Departments and whether its members will be able to gain 
support from Congress. 
  The U.S. Military has continually emphasized its 
contribution 
to the security of Asia and its consideration for the lives of 
residents. The team does not wish to interpret as lip service 
the declaration of former Marine Commandant Stackpole, attached 
to the Pacific Fleet at Okinawa, that there would be a partial 
abolition of training across Route 104. 
  Whether the "partial abolition" of training becomes a step 
to 
the total abolition of the training that crosses Route 104 and 
whether it will become linked to an abolition of gun platforms 
near residential areas, self-control over their use, and a 
decrease in the frequency of training are all specific points 
that need to be ascertained through talks with high-ranking 
government officials. 
  Concerning the reversion of the naval port in Naha, while it 
has become a formal topic for the Japan-U.S. joint committee, 
the team's having received the explanation that the endeavor is 
facing difficulties shows that one cannot view with optimism the 
governor's negotiations in Washington. 
  The team visiting the United States has three important 
proposals, including the return of Yomitan Airfield. The team 
will also ask for items on which Japan and the United States 
have not yet agreed: Futenma Airfield, the Okuma Recreation 
Center, and the return and/or reduction of water and air areas. 
Their diplomatic skill will be called into question on whether 
a hole can be opened in the thick walls of the U.S. side. 
  The group learned from the Hawaiian State Government the 
details on how the Kahorawe [name as received] Island training 
ground used for live-firing exercises by the U.S. Navy and 
Marines and in Rimpac exercises was returned through the union 
of the residents' movement, the state government, and the 
state's congressmen. On the basis of special U.S. Congress 
legislation, the state and the military authorities reportedly 
agreed on a plan to dispose of unexploded bombs and use the 
site. The legislation now before the Diet for the transfer of 
specified facilities from the military appears realistic. From 
the record of Kahorawe's return, Governor Ota's team obtained 
information for promoting the future return of the bases and use 
of the sites.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hope for Progress in Issues Related to Military </F>
Bases"] 
  [Text] In postwar Okinawa, there have been two cases in 
which the Okinawan people put up a united front in a "people's 
struggle." Needless to say, one of these was the struggle for 
the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese rule, and the other was the 
"struggle for land." The first struggle came to a successful 
conclusion for the most part on 15 May 1972. However, the 
second struggle has yet to end, strictly speaking. Today, U.S. 
military bases which occupy a large portion of the land on 
Okinawa still continue to suppress and hamper the livelihood of 
the Okinawan people and impede Okinawa's reconstruction and 
development projects as well as its future, even though 23 years 
have already passed since reversion. 
  Recently, however, it is heartening to see new moves toward 
settling Okinawa's land problems. 
  One such move is the fact that the United States, which is 
the most important of the parties concerned in the land issue, 
has started inspecting, evaluating, and considering the issue. 
Taking into consideration the changes in the international 
political situation and the military scene due to the collapse 
of the Cold War structure, it is only natural that the United 
States has decided to review the matter. 
  Another move is one that has been brought about by the 
collapse of the political structure in which the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] continuously held on to power since 1955, 
changes in the domestic political situation, and changes in the 
government's attitude regarding the issue of military bases on 
Okinawa. 
  Politicians from different parties are also moving toward 
helping enact a bill on special measures for promoting the use 
of land currently occupied by military bases, upon their return. 
  Finally, let us not overlook the fact that the local chapter 
of the LDP has revised its policy regarding military bases. 
  In the past, it seemed that military base issues were a 
specialty of the local reformist forces. Local conservative 
parties, including the local chapter of the LDP, appeared to be 
passive about military base issues, entrapped in the framework 
of the Japan-U.S. security arrangement upheld by the LDP, which 
dominated national politics. However, the local conservatives 
bid farewell to their past at the local LDP chapter's convention 
held on 10 June. They spelled out a local-interests-oriented 
platform, asserting that "a new economic system and a 
reconstruction of the social structure is being sought," and 
that "progress has not been made despite efforts to reduce 
excessive reliance on military bases by calling for their 
consolidation and retrenchment." 
  As the history of postwar "people's struggles" show, the 
only 
time that the Okinawan people emerged victorious was when they 
were able to put up a united front. Among the problems that 
Okinawa faced were the struggle for reversion and the struggle 
to uphold the four principles regarding safeguarding the 
Okinawan people's land. Such problems were basically related to 
domestic policies and foreign affairs. Okinawans were up 
against the United States as well as their own home country. 
Against such a solid wall, the greatest power that could pierce 
an opening in this wall toward solving these problems is their 
unity and determination. As former U.S. Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger has written in his book, the strength and 
determination of the local people can change both foreign and 
national policies. 
  Currently, Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota is visiting the 
United States in a bid to resolve such issues related to 
military bases as the return of the naval port in Naha, return 
of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and suspension of live-shell 
firing exercises across prefectural route 104. On 10 June, Ota 
met with Hawaii Governor John Waihee and held a news conference 
with U.S. reporters, during which he explained the situation of 
U.S. military bases on Okinawa and tried to gain understanding 
on the purpose of his U.S. visit. During the same news 
conference, U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie, who is a 
member of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, 
disclosed that a provision for a total review of U.S. military 
bases on Okinawa has been included in a bill calling for a 
review of national defense for fiscal year 1995. The bill was 
recently approved by the House Armed Services Committee. The 
representative reportedly has also said: "Firm demands by 
Governor Ota are necessary so that the United States will 
actually conduct a total review of its military bases on 
Okinawa." It is hoped that with the Okinawan people firmly 
backing him up, the governor can turn his U.S. visit and his 
efforts at "direct diplomacy" into a tremendously fruitful 
mission. 
  Although it may be a little early at this stage, groundwork 
should eventually be laid down to handle matters in the event 
the land occupied by military bases are turned over. In this 
regard, it is urged that a law on special measures for promoting 
diversion of military-occupied land be enacted during the 
current Diet session by all means.

  [Text] Kin -- Yoshimoto Masanori, lieutenant governor of 
the Okinawa Prefectural Government, observed a live-firing 
exercise conducted by the U.S. Marine Corps on Okinawa across 
Prefectural Highway No. 104 on the morning of 14 June. The 
live-firing exercise was the fifth such exercise since the 
beginning of this year. During his observation, the lieutenant 
governor surveyed how the highway was blockaded during the 
live-firing exercise and how the exercise affected the lives of 
residents. This is the first time that the lieutenant governor 
has observed an exercise since taking office. Meanwhile, a rally 
was staged to protest the live-firing exercise in Kodai, Igei 
District, under the auspices of the Okinawa Peace Movement 
Center. Rally participants blocked about 70 armed U.S. Marines 
trying to march through the rally, sparking a brief jostle 
between the Marines and labor unionists. 
  Lieutenant Governor Masanori and other prefectural 
government 
officials arrived at Prefectural Highway 14 at 0800 on the 
morning of 14 June when the live-fire exercise began. Katsuhiro 
Yoshida, chief of Kin town, told the lieutenant governor: 
"Forty years of live-firing exercise have turned Mt. Onna into 
a treeless mountain. Nature there is being destroyed. Red soil 
from training grounds where trees and rocks have disappeared are 
destroying Kin Bay. I want the live-firing exercise halted 
immediately." The town chief also pleaded with the lieutenant 
governor for an early enactment of the Military Land Conversion 
Law to promote the effective use of military lands to be 
returned. 
  In response, the lieutenant governor said: "U.S. Forces in 
Okinawa are certainly moving to cut back their training. 
However, the live-firing exercise is not a problem that can be 
resolved simply by streamlining and scaling back U.S. military 
bases in Okinawa. The exercises should be halted completely. I 
intend to speak out against the exercises with the residents' 
sufferings in mind." 
  One shell after another was fired into Mt. Onna when the 
lieutenant governor observed the live-firing exercise.

<F P=106> [Article by Miyako Suda, professor at Gakushuin University: </F>
"Economic Measures With View To Effect Overseas; Growing 
Mobility of Capital; Japan's Surplus Does Not Cause Bad Effects"] 
  [Excerpts] 1) Currently, international capital 
movements are increasing. Economic stimulus measures should be 
considered under an open macro model like the "Mandel-Fleming 
model." According to the model, the higher capital mobility is 
and the smaller the relative weight a country has in the global 
economy, the less effective are measures to expand demand. When 
we consider the degree of capital mobility and our size in the 
world economy, as well as the effects that future income produce 
on current savings, we cannot expect too much effect from this 
February's comprehensive economic measures. 
  2) Even though we cannot expect effects on domestic 
income, the chances are good for ripple effects on other 
nations' income. Also, Japan's current accounts surplus does not 
cause a worsening of the world business climate. 
  3) Policy dialogues are ever more needed so as to 
mutually understand each country's policies and gauge the 
effects that domestic demand expansion will have on every other 
nation. 
<H5>  Fears of Comprehensive Economic Measures's Ineffectiveness </H5>
  It has been 20 years since the shift to a floating exchange 
rate system, and during this time economic interchange 
domestically and abroad has become quite activated. Impacts that 
Japanese economic policies have on other nations' economies can 
no longer be disregarded. The comprehensive economic measures 
announced February 1994 have drawn attention not only at home 
but from abroad as well, and the United States has repeatedly 
expressed its disappointment. 
  As the interdependence of domestic and foreign economies 
grows, one must use open macro models covering not just the 
domestic but the foreign as well when scrutinizing the effects 
of economic countermeasures. However, a major point at issue in 
evaluating these comprehensive economic measures is how large 
the ultimate direct increase in demand will be. We can hardly 
find any cases in which changes in things like exchange rates 
and interest rates and their effects are explicitly considered. 
  A typical case of a Keynesian model taking the scope of 
capital mobility into consideration is the Mandel-Fleming model. 
In this model what is distinctive is the point that it 
emphasizes the role of capital mobility. When capital mobility 
is high under a floating exchange rate market, measures to 
expand internal demand are cutting taxes, augmenting public 
investment, and setting rates of interest on the high side. That 
will bring a massive capital influx and force up currency 
values. For small nations, the result will be that foreign 
demand (current account balances) will decrease to that extent 
even if measures to expand domestic demand are adopted, and 
overall demand will be unchanged, making measures on the macro 
business climate quite invalid. 
  However, as Japan is no small nation and since we cannot 
conceive of domestic and foreign interest rates being congruent 
as U.S. economist Robert Mandel hypothesized, we cannot apply 
this conclusion as is. If we take these into consideration and 
revise them, measures stimulating internal demand would not be 
ineffective but would bring on high interest rates, a strong 
yen, financial balances going into deficit, and a shrinkage in 
the current accounts balance surplus. So, we are led to the 
conclusion that we cannot expect much of a rise in the domestic 
business climate. [passage omitted] 
  The world's current account balances taken together add up 
to 
zero; however, when we consider such things as that limitation 
not applying to financial balances or the ripple effects from 
other nations, we cannot always get results precisely according 
to the model. Still, we may not be able to call adopting the 
Mandel style of thinking inappropriate. 
  Lately, attention is being drawn to ideas that seek to get 
decisions on consumption and savings by explicitly taking into 
consideration even income expected in the future. When one 
brings those ideas into decisions about consumption and savings, 
the effectiveness of measures to stimulate internal demand 
becomes lower. If we look into these ideas, policies cutting 
income taxes become totally ineffective regardless of whether 
financial resources are from increased taxes or issuance of 
government deficit bonds. Deficit government bonds mean 
increased taxes in the future, but since consumption is decided 
upon by taking that into consideration, even if taxes are cut, 
savings will merely increase, preparing for future increased 
taxes. Such thinking is called "Ricardo's neutrality thesis." 
  This idea is often applied in criticizing the Ministry of 
Finance's challenge to the issuance of deficit government bonds, 
but I cannot believe this thesis will be rigorously put into 
effect. Yet, there is corroborative analysis that we cannot 
negate this thesis. Graph 2 [not translated] shows the ratios of 
the government's net receipts to gross domestic product (GDP) 
and shifts in household savings rates in Japan. In times of 
growing government net receipts, the domestic savings rate 
decreases; therefore, we may be unable to ignore completely that 
thesis even in Japan. 
  If we thus take into consideration savings rate changes due 
to policies, the economic stimulative effects will be even less. 
  It is not that such theoretical ideas as the above have been 
totally ignored in the recent policy debates. In evaluating the 
economic measures this time, we saw many adopting views dubious 
about the effects of tax cuts which projected increased taxes. 
On the other hand, we also came across arguments which, from a 
standpoint not assuming the neutrality thesis's effectuation, 
would link recent high interest rates to issuance of government 
deficit bonds by cutting taxes. 
  However, on exchange rates, arguments emerge such as that 
the 
United States will work to induce a higher yen if Japan does not 
adequately stimulate domestic demand, or that stimulating 
internal demand will cut current account surpluses and so reduce 
external frictions and hence "the wise way is to stimulate 
internal demand if we want to avoid a higher yen." Yet, there is 
very little sense of its being axiomatic that we will get a high 
yen from stimulating domestic demand. Consequently, we do not 
know how correctly the measures for stimulating domestic demand 
are being evaluated. 
<H5>  Ripple Effects Overseas Cannot Be Ignored </H5>
  When the scale of direct stimulation of domestic demand is 
small or when the private sector reacts to government actions in 
such a way as to offset them, there are no ripple effects either 
at home or abroad. Nor do current account surpluses change. 
However, if the offsetting effects by the private sector are not 
so large, measures to stimulate domestic demand may not be 
effective, we cannot ignore their ripple effect overseas. 
  To reflect on this point, let us consider a simple global 
model resembling the economic structure for all nations. If we 
include each nation's method for determining incomes, the sum of 
external demand will be zero. Hence, we can treat the world as a 
closed economy. In short, the world's business climate is 
determined by the scale of the total of internal demand in all 
nations. Global income and decisions on interest rates do not 
relate either to capital mobility or to the degree of mutual 
trade dependence. Moreover, whatever nation uses them, effective 
demand measures will have the same impact on global income. The 
issue is how the effects are apportioned to each nation. 
  In cases such as in the Mandel-Fleming model where they are 
balanced and internal and external interest rates are in accord, 
the distribution from measures stimulating internal demand will 
be determined by a nation's size. Hence, when a major nation 
puts internal-demand expansion measures into effect, the impact 
at home will be great while the ripple effect on foreign nations 
will be small. More so than if the United States boosts its 
internal demand, Japan's stimulating its internal demand would 
have the effect of causing the portion spilling over into other 
nations to be larger. 
  However, when capital mobility is not very great, since the 
currency of the nation carrying out such policies does not rise 
very much, the ripple effect abroad will become a bit smaller. 
  In addition, although the scale of ripple effects will 
differ 
under a variety of major factors, those are assuredly in a 
positive direction. A rise in interest rates will come about 
through this process and that is often criticized by foreign 
nations. For other nations, however, the effect of lowering the 
value of the currency will be larger than the rise in interest 
rates. 
<H5>  Give Weight to Policy Dialogues With Other Nations </H5>
  In Japan's current expansion of its current accounts 
balance, 
there is an aspect of ripple effects of the U.S. economic 
expansion. The ripple effect from the United States is 
defensive. Problem is that, seeing the surpluses caused by that 
and view this as robbing it of employment. Also, economic growth 
rates have often been an aim of promises made abroad; however, 
the smaller a nation is which stimulates its internal demand the 
more other nations' income will grow without increasing domestic 
income. It is absurd to judge its contribution to a foreign 
nation's economy from the resulting economic growth rate. 
  Again, from the fact that global internal demand determines 
the world's business climate, surpluses in Japan's current 
accounts do not cause adverse effects on the world's business 
climate. To say that Japan's current account surpluses are a 
problem, we must say that foreign nations' current account 
deficits--the other side of Japan's current account 
surpluses--restrain global internal demand. 
  However, aside from such cases as heavily indebted 
developing 
nations, such restraints are inconceivable for advanced nations 
whose capital mobility is high. For example, we cannot conceive 
of the U.S. economic policies being constrained by current 
account deficits. If there were such an aspect to the United 
States, we would not have to concern ourselves with the matter 
of how to get the United States to take up fiscal moderation. 
This problem is always an issue when considering reforms of the 
international currency system, but no solution has been found 
yet. Where could there be an advanced nation whose economic 
policies are being restrained because its current accounts are 
in deficit? 
  With measures stimulating domestic demand by tax cuts and 
public investment, if an easy-money policy is adopted at the 
same time, when increases in income cannot be expected much, 
interest rates will fall and currency will lose value. Hence, 
impacts can be expected domestically. But an easy-money policy 
has adverse effects on other nations' incomes by raising 
currency valuations; therefore, it is undesirable for those 
nations' economies. It should be also clear from this that it is 
absurd to evaluate the degree of contribution to foreign 
nations' economies by economic growth rate record. 
  In any case, ripple effects vary greatly depending on 
policies; therefore, exchanges of views on what kinds of 
policies each nation seeks to adopt become important. Policy 
dialogues internally and abroad will become increasingly vital 
in the future so that to judge whether for the world as a whole 
the scale of internal demand is appropriate.

Bank of Japan: "Extend Export Exchange Contracts to Four or Five 
Years--Strive To Avoid Losses From Quotation Differences; Part 
of Financial Activities for Which Comprehensive Management Is 
Needed"] 
  [Text] 1) The manner in which currency risk 
management is conducted in Japan's export industries is one of 
the reasons that corporate performances falter when the yen 
appreciates. If export industries improve risk management 
through longer term exchange contracts, business deterioration 
can be avoided to some extent even if the yen appreciates. 
  Industrial structure changes necessitated by yen 
appreciation 
can also be carried out more smoothly. 
  2) If exchange risks are hedged beforehand, the action 
will become a pressure against yen appreciation and currency 
adjustments will proceed rapidly; therefore, it will become a 
factor in curbing excessive investments in the export business 
and in restraining trade imbalances. 
  3) To develop stablility and soundness in the Japanese 
economy, the reassessment of ALM (Assets and Liabilities 
Management) process of individual corporations and agumentation 
of their management structures are necessary. 
<H5>  6-Month Period Is Too Short for Hedging </H5>
  The exchange fluctuation rate was 10 percent, on an annual 
basis, during the 20 years from 1973 to 1992. That means that 
Japanese export industries continued to export while shouldering 
the risk that yen-denominated sales proceeds which fluctuate 
about 10 percent annually. During the same 20-year period from 
1973 to 1992, the number of automobiles sold in the U.S. market 
fluctuated at an annual rate of 10 percent. This can be called 
the "business risk" of fluctuating sales affected by changes in 
the economy. In other words, as for exports, the "exchange risk" 
that proceeds would decrease because of the yen's appreciation 
was as big a risk as the "business risk" of declining sales and 
receipts due to deteriorating business conditions. 
  Many people think that "the currency risk should naturally 
be 
big for export industries," and that is actually true. The 
problem is, although the exchange risk can be hedged by simply 
using forward exchange contracts, that action has been neglected. 
  It is commonly believed that "export industries are using 
forward exchange contracts as a hedge." At present, however, 
forward contracts of export industries cover, at the most, only 
about half of the annual exports, i.e., only sales up to about 
six months ahead. Japan's export industries cannot stop 
exporting suddenly even if the yen appreciates. If exports are 
to be continued with existing production capabilities, it is 
clear that, if the yen appreciates (after six months), 
yen-denominated sales proceeds would decrease and difficulties 
would arise (even if product prices are raised on 
dollar-denominated basis, sales volume would decline; therefore, 
yen-denominated proceeds would decrease). Therefore, business 
would slump in Japan if the yen appreciates. 
  Since forward exchange contracts of present export 
industries 
cover too short a duration, there is practically no hedge 
against exchange risks. It might be said that they are 
conducting business operations while carrying an enormous 
exchange risk. To avoid this, they must conclude forward 
contracts covering exports over a longer period of time. 
Considering the depreciation period of the current export 
production lines and the employment situation, flexibility of 
product prices, etc., forward exchange contracts needed as 
actual risk hedges must cover four to five years and over 10 
times the current monetary amount. Then, the predicament of 
carrying the obvious and enormous exchange risk of business 
deterioration from yen appreciation can be evaded. 
  If exports spreading over four or five years are hedged, the 
exports made with current facilities will be settled on a 
yen-denominated basis even if the yen appreciates; therefore, 
there will be ample time for corporate structural changes in 
case the management strategy is taken to reduce exports in 
stages and promote local production. Also, management can avoid 
sudden setbacks caused by yen appreciation. 
  The same line of thinking should apply when making new 
capital investments. When setting up production lines for 
exports, basically, the exchange rate that can be contracted 
into the future must be made the standard. Proceeds of exported 
products that are manufacturd at these export production lines 
should be received in dollars in the future. The export proceeds 
to be received in the future should basically be hedged and the 
possible contract rate should become the basis of investment 
planning. Concretely, annual capital investments will be hedged 
with the output intended for exports to be used as the basis to 
calculate the dollar-denominated cash flow. 
  If such exchange risk hedges had been in place in the past, 
what would've been the effects on currency markets and 
macroecnomics? If Japan's export industries had exercised 
exchange risk management and concluded long- and medium-term 
forward exchange contracts for anticipated exports, the yen 
would have appreciated sooner under the dollar-selling pressure 
of forward contracts and industrial structure changes would have 
proceeded rapidly while the present trade frictions could have 
been averted to some extent. 
<H5>  Concept To Increase Corporate "Current Value" </H5>
  Long- and medium-term forward exchange contracts are 
basically similar to the short-term forward contracts frequently 
used in export contracts and have been used by Japanese 
corporations since early 1980's to hedge currency risks of 
foreign currency-denominated debentures issued by corporations. 
  Meanwhile, long- and medium-term forward exchange contracts 
from an ALM standpoint, including hedging of future exports, 
have become possible institutionally through the abolishment of 
the actual demand rule in 1984. Subsequently, the ALM concept 
has not permeated the corporate circle and even today, hedging 
operations are limited to hedges against financial risks, such 
as hedging foreign currency-denominated corporate bonds and 
hedging a company's product inventories through short-term 
export contracts. Movements to hedge against exchange risks, 
from an overall corporate ALM standpoint, are not apparent. 
  To control risks, such as those created by currency 
fluctuations, Japanese corporations must basically reassess the 
past process of business management and change to a 
comprehensive ALM setup. First, in the past emphasis tended to 
be focused on profits and losses of a settlement period revealed 
through financial accounting. Hereafter, it is important to 
introduce the concept of increasing the current value of the 
entire corporation. 
  Second, in the past attention tended to be directed to 
financial risk management, but hereafter, attention must be paid 
to overall corporate risk management, based on cash flow in 
business operations, such as future payments for exports and raw 
materials. Third, the use of hedging measures, such as 
derivatives, are important to control risks. 
  Periodic profits and losses based on financial accounting 
can 
be exaggerated, e.g., by including latent profits of stock 
holdings or through various other settlement manipulations. In 
such cases, since the values that should be realized in the 
future are being preempted for the current year, it is the same 
as passing the bill for that amount to subsequent years. 
Actually, there are cases that latent losses are being carried 
on the basis of book rate valuations because of forward contract 
extensions or that latent losses are being carried because of 
price declines of stock holdings; therefore, there are many 
cases that the periodic profits and losses appear favorable, but 
the real conditions of the company are worsening. 
  In enforcing ALM, therefore, the operations must include 
control of latent profits and losses. To do this, the concept of 
"current value," which expresses the real economic value, must 
be employed. "Current value equals book value plus or minus 
latent profits and losses" and the "current value profits and 
losses equal periodic profits and losses plus or minus latent 
profits and losses." Therefore, the aim of ALM is to increase 
the "current value" of a company by including all of the 
potential profits and losses in a consolidated form. A company's 
current value is assessed in the stock market as the total 
market value of its shares; therefore, increasing the current 
value has the same effect as increasing its stock prices. 
  Since a company's current value is computed on the basis of 
"current value of its assets and liabilities," ALM is concerned 
with market values of assets and liabilities. Risk calculations 
are made by figuring out how current values of assets and 
liabilities are altered by risk factors, such as interest and 
exchange rate fluctuations, commodity price variations, etc. 
Risk management, employing hedging measures, should be carried 
out to minimize these risks and maximize the company's current 
value. This series of actions constitutes "ALM." 
  In the process of calculating current values, it is 
necessary 
to consider the entire cash flow, including future receipts and 
payments expected by the company. This action is the first step 
in sound "ALM" that considers latent profits and losses. At 
present, financial cash flows, such as interest payments and 
foreign bond issuances, are managed relatively well, but there 
are many cases that cash flows involving exports and raw 
materiel payments are taken for granted and not considered as 
factors for risk management. In other words, interest and 
exchange rate risks affecting financial status are managed, but 
risks involving exports, imports, and raw materials tend to be 
neglected although the concerned sums are relatively large. The 
exchange risk affecting the sales of export industries is a 
typical example. 
  Furthermore, since these risks are often managed separately, 
the interrelationships between risks tend to be ignored. Since 
there are cases that risks hedge against each other, it is 
essential to consider comprehensive risk management which takes 
into account all of the company's risks. 
  For example, let us consider the case of a company, which is 
engaged in exports to the United States, issuing 
dollar-denominated corporate bonds. If the yen appreciates, the 
yen-denominated value of cash inflow from future exports to the 
United States will decrease, but since the yen-denominated value 
of cash outflow in future payments on dollar bonds will also 
decrease, both are hedging each other against exchange risks. If 
attention is paid only to the exchange risk in the financial 
sector and dollar bonds are hedged on yen-denominated basis, the 
exchange risk is being enlarged from the overall company 
standpoint. 
<H5>  Swaps, Etc., Are Inexpensive </H5>
  Risk management must be flexible when undertaking ALM. The 
use of long- and medium-term forward exchange contracts as well 
as the derivatives market, such as swaps, futures and options, 
will become important. Derivatives are useful in providing the 
required amount of control, when needed, of necessary risks and 
they are inexpensive. 
  Take exchange risks for example, there are cases that 
European automobile manufacturers have concluded long-term 
forward exchange contracts on exports to Japan, and leading 
U.S.-European corporations have fully established ALM setups. 
They are also aggressively using derivatives for hedging 
purposes. 
  In Japan, although there are many corporations dealing with 
exports and imports, there has been little progress in the 
establishment of ALM systems and utilization of risk hedging 
measures. If individual corporations establish the ALM 
structure, corporate values and performances will stabilize, and 
that will in turn lead to stability of the macroeconomics of 
this collective corporate body.

<F P=106> [Article in three installments by political reporters, Shuzo </F>
Sato for the first installment, Koichi Kobata for the second 
installment, and Isamu Niwa for the third installment: "Stormy 
Sailing--Hata `Minority Coalition' Regime"] 
<H5>  [30 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] "Recalling the period of eight months, I am proud to 
say that the coalition government has curved out a path for 
great and new Japanese politics. Ours has now become a 
government of a minority coalition, but we will do our best for 
smooth progress of Japan with sincerity and joint efforts." 
  On the night of 28 April [1994], at his first press 
conference since assuming the office, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata showed a touch of vexation at the condition in which he was 
forced to start the "Hata regime" with the minority of the 
ruling coalition. 
  Prime Minister Hata is "the choice" of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], and his government was born by easily obtaining 
a majority of votes--274 votes in the lower house and 127 votes 
in the upper house. Although the second coalition government 
appeared to make a smooth start, the foothold of the government 
crumbled from its foundation all at once when the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition 
government. 
  The genuine ruling coalition bolstering the government 
numbers 182, a little over one-third of the total in the lower 
house. The coalition force will only be 202 members even if to 
count the members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the new party of 
Mirai [the Future Party]. Sakigake left the coalition, pledging 
to cooperate from the outside of the cabinet and Mirai broke 
away from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and is assuming the 
pro-coalition stance. Things are severer in the upper house as 
the coalition holds 62 persons which account for only about 
one-fourth of the total strength. This explains the conditions 
under which "none of the bills can be passed" (a leading member 
of the ruling coalition in the upper house). 
  In his cabinet formation, Prime Minister Hata picked eight 
members from Shinseito and six from Komeito. The "Shinsei-Komei" 
tie has thus become strong. He has staffed his official 
residence by an excellent pair from Shinseito, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Naoto Kitamura. He reappointed Mr. Hirohisa Fujii to the post of 
finance minister who deals with tax system issue and Mr. Hajime 
Ishii to the post of home affairs minister who takes charge of 
political reform. Both of them are Shinseito members and thus in 
essence the prime minister has clearly indicated the "Shinseito 
leadership." 
  In the Hosokawa government, a rift between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
deprived the official residence of its centripetal force. That 
became a factor in inviting bureaucratic leadership. Hata seeks 
to solidify his official residence thereby to exercise power of 
control over bureaucrats. There are such aims in "Hata's 
personnel management." 
  The fate of Hata government hangs on a tax system reform and 
a bill for rezoning of single-seat constituencies with a 
proportional representation system. We can see that Hata 
cabinet poised to attempt a frontal breakthrough on these two 
pending bills. 
  With the SDPJ's secession from the government and Sakigake's 
cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, policy 
coordinations within the ruling coalition are likely to proceed 
smoothly unlike in the past. However, problem lies after that. 
At his press conference, Prime Minister Hata expressed his 
expectations for cooperation from both the LDP and the SDPJ, 
saying that "there was a word (from the SDPJ) that it would 
cooperate as best as it can for the benefit of the nation" and 
that, although we and the LDP may have clashes over some issues, 
"I believe the LDP will extend its cooperation on policy 
matters, and I would like to ask it to do so." However, the 
situation is not as optimistic as that. 
  The ruling coalition government desires to present the 
rezoning bill to the Diet as soon as possible after the fiscal 
1994 budget is approved. In addition to the election strategy of 
Shinseito which wants to carry out the election under a new 
system, the coalition government believes that "such a step can 
forestall the introduction of a no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet by the LDP and the SDPJ" (a leading member of the ruling 
coalition). 
  However, there is a tenacious voice, within both the LDP and 
the SDPJ, calling for the dissolution of the lower house and a 
general election under the existing system; therefore, 
undoubtedly there will be fierce quarrels between ruling and 
opposition parties after passage of the proposed budget. 
  With the "question of 100 million yen loans" from the Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking firm to former Prime Minister Hosokawa still 
remaining unsettled, the issue may easily turn into a factor for 
a great turbulence, depending on the opposition parties' 
approach to the issue. There are many seeds of fiery 
confrontation between ruling and opposition parties, including 
measures to cope with issues of nuclear development in the DPRK 
(North Korea). 
  In the Hosokawa regime, the initiative under the "Ichi-Ichi 
[Ichiro and Yuichi] line" by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa and Kometo Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa surfaced in 
various aspects. With the SDPJ and Sakigake having left the 
coalition, the "Ichi-Ichi line" could very well be brought out 
in relief in the Hata government. In what form will the 
opposition to such development take place? 
  Sadao Yamahana, member of the SDPJ and former minister in 
charge of political reform, asserted at a meeting of the party's 
Diet members on 28 April [1994] that "the Hata cabinet will be 
unable to fulfil the role greater than one assigned to a budget 
management cabinet." Voicing his feelings of desperation, a 
leading member of the ruling coalition made the following 
remarks: "We have no other choice but to make desperate efforts 
for the first two months. If we keep striving with the given 
minority, we may enlist sympathy for the weakling." 
  Without carrying enough "fuel," the ship "Shinsei-Hata Maru" 
is compelled to launch out on a stormy sea, bearing the destiny 
of the coalition government on its shoulder. The sea route to 
follow is invisible. The "political change in June theory" is 
increasingly acquiring a flavor of reality. 
<H5>  [1 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  }[Text] "Nobody knows what may happen tomorrow in the 
political world. Nothing has shown this more vividly than the 
recent political change," deplores one of Shinseito leaders. 
  Before dawn of 26 [April 1994], SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama announced his party's secession from the coalition 
government at a press conference he held urgently. 
  The SDPJ's secession from the government, the new Hata 
regime 
suddenly slid down to a "minority ruling coalition." A Komeito 
leader said, "A momentary judgment often sways one's fate, 
bringing one's prosperity or fall." 
  At his first inaugural press conference on 28 April, Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata touched on the formation of a joint 
parliamentary union called the "Reform" which led to [Hata's] 
"fall into Hell from Heaven" (a leading Shinseito member) 
through the SDPJ's secession from the government. Gnawing his 
lips, the prime minister made the following remarks: "I did not 
know that things were proceeding that way. As things were 
getting serious, I became aware that there were some mutual 
misunderstandings, but it was already too late then." His words 
sounded as if to suggest a difficult future of the Hata regime. 
  The unfolding new political situation of the Hata regime 
foreshadows a desperate struggle and confusion involving both 
ruling and opposition parties. There are three major forces: the 
"ruling coalition" formed by Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New 
Party [JNP], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the 
Liberal Party; the LDP; and the SDPJ. In addition, Sakigake, 
which shifted to cooperation from the outside of the cabinet, 
and Mirai, a new party which has broken away from the LDP, will 
also be entangled complicatedly. 
  China's RENMIN RIBAO reported: "Viewed from a historic 
angle, 
Japan's political situation is reminiscent of its `age of civil 
strife.' A great upheaval is continuing, and the map of the 
political quarters will remain unclear until the end of the next 
election." 
  The "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa 
displayed a initiative in the former Hosokawa regime and also in 
making the current Hata regime. The high-handed political 
methods of this line drove Sakigake, which is led by former 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, into outside-Cabinet 
cooperation and invited the SDPJ's "rebellion." Though not 
openly, a voice calling for reconsidering the "Ichi-Ichi line" 
is being raised gradually inside Shinseito and Komeito, and the 
"Ichi-Ichi line" appears to have reached the crucial point. 
  Mr. Ozawa and his followers are now elaborating on the next 
gambit to make up for their "great miscalculation" that resulted 
in the SDPJ's secession from the government. It is a gambit for 
setting off a split between the LDP and the SDPJ and making the 
political situation fluid toward a new realignment of the 
political world. To this end, it will be sought to pass a bill 
on rezoning of single-seat constituency system for lower house 
even at the cost of prolonging the current Diet session 
(scheduled to end on 29 June). This is because when the 
single-seat constituency system is realized, a large number of 
LDP and SDPJ Diet members will lose their seats, thereby 
inevitably accelerating the realignment of the political world. 
  Prior to such a development, both the LDP and the SDPJ, the 
two giants of the "1955 system," with their strategies to expand 
their influences by bringing about a Diet dissolution and a 
general election under the existing medium-size constituency. 
After its secession from the government, the SDPJ immediately 
had its general secretary talk with the LDP's secretary general, 
exploring the way for the "LDP-SDPJ tieup." Fierce offensive and 
defensive battles are inevitable between new and old forces over 
handling of the proposed budget and the single-seat constituency 
rezoning bill until the end of the current Diet session. 
  Amid this process, activities for "liquidizing" the 
political 
situation will further deepen, and "various combinations of 
alliance and league will be groped for below the surface of the 
water" (a leading SDPJ member). The minor new parties, Sakigake 
and Mirai, "must rack their brains over how to steer themselves 
among alliances and leagues and grab a casting vote" (a leading 
Sakigake member). 
  Only a few days have passed since the Hata cabinet started, 
but a theory is already afloat in Nagata-cho [where Diet 
building is located] that "the general election will be held on 
24 July." This marks the beginning of a war of information on 
the political situation. 
  The plot of the "24 July" theory is as follows: Toward the 
end of June, the issue of extending the session of the Diet will 
be raised over the handling of the proposed budget and the 
singel-seat constituency rezoning bill. Such an extension will 
conflict with deadlines set for the settlement of the ruling 
coalition's tax reform bills and the government's market-opening 
measures. There is also a strong possibility that the LDP and 
the SDPJ will jointly bring forward a no-confidence motion 
against the cabinet. The political situation will get 
"liquidized" at a stroke. The Naple summit (the meeting of 
leaders of advanced countries), to be held from 8 to 10 July, is 
also around the corner. Under this scenario, through a period 
covering before and after the summit meeting, the lower house 
will be dissolved and the holding of the general election will 
be publicly announced. 
  "Anything could happen from now on and I will not be 
surprised." 
  "I will race ahead, bracing myself like a soldier on the 
battlefield." 
  These sharp words have been uttered successively by ruling 
and opposition party lawmakers who were leaving for their local 
constituencies to spend a long consecutive holidays. 
<H5>  [2 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] "It is an extremely weak cabinet by a minority 
ruling coalition. More than half of the lawmakers elected by the 
people do not entertain expectations." "When the prime minister 
is not the top strong man leading Shinseito (the largest party 
in the ruling camp), we know that the power has a dual 
structure." 
  On the evening of 28 April [1994] when the Hata regime 
started, LDP President Yohei Kono scathingly criticized the 
Shinseito-led new government. The use of the phrase "extremely 
weak cabinet" was even suggestive of his tenacious desire to 
overthrow the cabinet. 
  The LDP was cheered by the SDPJ's secession from the 
government. It sets out to build a "joint front" with the SDPJ, 
saying that "the LDP versus non-LDP shackles have now been 
removed" (a leading member). On 27 April, the day after the 
secession was declared, [LDP] Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and 
[SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo confirmed close tieup in 
the future Diet operation, and this position was reconfirmed at 
a later meeting of the Diet Affairs Committee chairmen. 
  The catchword of the tieup is "opposition to the high-handed 
use of power." This means that they will join hands under the 
logic that "an enemy's enemy is a friend" in opposition to the 
so-called "Ichi-Ichi line" political method employed by 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa, "a method ignoring parliamentary 
democracy" in the LDP's view. 
  One of the leading members of the LDP says that "when the 
LDP 
and the SDPJ join hands, they can grab and exercise 
life-and-death power over all bills." Their strategy is very 
clear. 
  Their position is that they may allow the proposed fiscal 
1994 budget to be approved, but that "things will be different 
after that." Immediately after the budget is approved, they will 
submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet and ask for 
its general resignation. While taking these actions, they will 
be even ready for the dissolution of the lower house and the 
general election. 
  LDP President Kono even went so far as declaring that "after 
the budget approval, there will be no more work to do for the 
new government." Until then, they are planning to undercut the 
government by thoroughly inquiring into former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's alleged improprieties. 
  Under this strategy, they are going to take the offensive 
for 
the "recapturing of standing committee chairmanships." The LDP 
and the SDPJ have 280 seats (206 seats for the LDP and 74 seats 
for the SDPJ) in the lower house, and this strength enables the 
opposition camp to form, so to speak, a "stable majority (270 
seats). They thus reckon that "theoretically, every post can be 
recaptured" (a leading member of the Mitsuzuka faction). As a 
first step, to bind the new government's hands and feet, the 
focuse of their target is in having surrendered the chairmanship 
of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Rules and 
Administration--the the key post for steering of the Diet. 
  However, at this stage, such tieup between the LDP and the 
SDPJ aims at no farther than the "overthrowing of the cabinet." 
In addition to the fear of the tieup being exposed to criticism 
that it marks a retrogression toward the 1955 system, there is 
an opposing view within the LDP that "the SDPJ is too afar from 
LDP in terms of policy" (a leading member of the Watanabe 
faction). Secretary General Mori, at the 28 April summit 
meeting, stated that "the joint struggle will be restricted 
within the house (Diet steering)," stressing that it did not 
presuppose a great coalition. The same is the case with the 
SDPJ. Immediately after the tieup was mutually confirmed, the 
party headquarters was flooded with the calls of protest, and it 
was busy explaining that "we are not joining in the work of 
restoring the LDP regime" (a leading member). 
  Since it lost the office in July 1993, the LDP has 
constantly 
been exposed to the danger of another split. During the period, 
20 members left the party through confrontations between 
supporters of the political reform legislation and those calling 
for a prudent approach, and the post-Hosokawa turmoil over 
former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe's defection and 
formation of a new party. The intraparty situation is not 
monolithic, and the aftereffects of those events are lingering. 
The executive leadership is busy working to avoid a split, and 
party reform is also left halfway. A leader admits the actual 
situation that "people see the coalition shaking; yet we hear no 
voice saying that let the LDP have power." 
  There are signs that the political world is drifting toward 
a 
"tripolar structure" divided largely by the ruling coalition, 
the LDP, and the SDPJ-Sakigake. Amid these signs, it is doubtful 
that any one bloc can single-handedly assume power. Both the LDP 
and the SDPJ are not free from the danger of intraparty split as 
well. 
  An elder lawmaker says: "From now on, we will be in the 
world 
of the history of the `Three States' [China's old wartime 
history book]. Activities will be swayed by party interests and 
individual interests. You may see a friend yesterday turn 
against you today." The LDP clearly upholds the position of 
overthrowing the present cabinet, and yet it fails to depict a 
firm scenario of its seizure of power. In such a condition the 
LDP is about to rush into the work of promoting fluidity in the 
political situation.

<F P=106> [Articles in three installments by ASAHI SHIMBUN political </F>
reporters; Hiroshi Tsuchiya, Etsuya Saito, Seiki Nemoto: "Hata 
Government Heading for Vortex of Realignment"] 
[30 Apr 94 p 2] 
  [Text] "The trend of the times cannot be halted. It has 
progressed beyond my expectations." 
  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] spoke thus during the selection of a successor to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. A political upheaval occasionally 
moves beyond the expectations of politicians. For Ozawa, who 
revolved the stage in a drama of a series of political changes 
from the previous prime minister's announcement of resignation 
to the inauguration of the new Hata cabinet, the withdrawal by 
the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] and the fall (of the 
administration) to a minority ruling coalition were undoubtedly 
unexpected evolvements as well. 
  Ozawa's initial strategy was to link the Hosokawa cabinet's 
departure to act 2 of political reorganization. His plan was to 
destroy the framework of the "LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]" 
versus the "non-LDP" that divided the ruling parties and the 
opposition and to marshal together a new political force by 
attracting a portion of the LDP and the SDPJ rightwing with 
Shinseito and Komeito in the center. 
<H5>  Non-LDP Exposes Limmitations </H5>
  The framework of the "non-LDP" forming the coalition 
administration had already exposed its limitations during the 
midpoint of the Hosokawa government. 
  In February [1994] the people's welfare tax concept 
initiated 
by Shinseito and Komeito was withdrawn due to opposition by the 
SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger]. The liberalization of the rice 
market and the political reform-related law also faced a 
"crisis" because of resistance by the SDPJ Diet members. 
Dissatisfaction was expressed by Shinseito that "under the 
present coalition framework, a policy evolvement with mobility 
is impossible." Meanwhile, the SDPJ also intensified its 
distrust of Ozawa et al for their "strongman tactics." 
  Regarding the selection of Hosokawa's successor, Ozawa tried 
his luck at "changing the coalition makeup." Support for former 
deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe was 
his trump card. His calculation was as follows: The SDPJ splits 
over support for Watanabe and its leftwing bolts from the 
administration. The gap is filled by deserters from the LDP. 
  Against this shakeup by Ozawa and his aides, the SDPJ braced 
itself to resist by uniting with Sakigake party and a portion of 
the DSP [Democratic Social Party] to which the SDPJ drew closer 
by its response to the people's welfare tax concept. The moves 
in search of a marshaling of "social democratic/liberal" forces 
including a portion of the LDP surfaced, and talk of an 
"LDP-SDPJ coalition" based on "an eye for an eye, and a tooth 
for a tooth" viewpoint was heard within the SDPJ. 
  The contradictions within the coalition 
administration--i.e., 
distortions between combinations of the political parties and 
policies, and differences in political methods--suddenly emerged 
with Hosokawa's resignation announcement. Each party definitely 
sensed the coming of "act 2 of reorganization." However, given 
the sudden resignation notice, every party was caught 
unprepared. An agreement by the coalition ruling parties to 
maintain the coalition framework and unified support for Hata 
constituted a kind of "political ceasefire." "The real battle 
comes two months from now." This was the view of the executives 
of each party. 
<H5>  SDPJ Rightwing Also Breaks Away </H5>
  However, the formation of the "Kaishin" [Renovation] new 
faction in the lower house raised unexpected tremors within the 
political circles. As the Shinseito executives admitted that "we 
underestimated the SDPJ," Ozawa had apparently never dreamed 
that it would result in the SDPJ's secession from the 
administration, forcing the Hata administration into the 
position of a minority government. 
  The greatest miscalculation was probably forcing secession 
by 
the SDPJ rightwing forces that had been the most aggressive 
supporters of the coalition. Even General Seceretary Wataru 
Kubo, who had taken pains to maintain solidarity with the 
coalition parties in the face of attacks from the SDPJ leftwing, 
vented his anger at the surprise formation of the new faction by 
stating: "There is a limit to my patience." 
  The leaders of the SDPJ who left the government are already 
making contacts with the leaders of the LDP and Sakigake party. 
Their mottoes are: "Let us protect the principles of democracy" 
and "let us be antifascists." Criticism of Ozawa's tactics thus 
continue. 
<H5>  Encirclement by LDP-SDPJ </H5>
  Contrary to the spliting of both the LDP and the SDPJ 
envisioned by Ozawa, an ironic twist is in the making of an 
"anti-Shinseito and anti-Komeito encirclement" by the LDP and 
SDPJ that have sustained the 1955 political system. However, 
major LDP-SDPJ differences concerning the basic policies of 
foreign affairs and defense remain, and there is a lack of 
realism in their cooperation. Their sole unity may exist in 
their joint struggle for an early dissolution of the lower house 
and a general election. 
  There are also serious internal circumstances in the 
coalition administration following the SDPJ's separation. There 
is fear within Shinseito and Komeito of a decline into a 
minority administration, and criticism within the DSP bursting 
forth against Chairman Keigo Ouchi who proposed the formation of 
the new faction. The Japan New Party is also affected by a 
fallout among its members. 
  With the inauguration of a minority administration resulting 
from the SDPJ secession, what is the future direction of 
political realignment? Will the formation of a policy-oriented 
framework which is seen as a "temporary ceasefire" revive 
itself? Without anyone seemingly convinced of it, the 
realignment drama moves on to the next act. 
<H5>  [1 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] LDP President Yohei Kono used the term "tactics" 
four times and the term "high-handed" three times in his short 
statement. "The high-pressure, high-handed tactics of Shinseito 
does not represent the inherent posture of parliamentary 
democracy." 
  It was on the morning of 26 April [1994] when the SDPJ 
rejected the newly formed faction "Kaishin" [Rennovation] and 
was asked by reporters for its thoughts concerning its secession 
from the coalition administration. Although he mentioned no 
names, it was clear that Kono's barbs were aimed at Shinseito 
General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the man behind Prime Minister 
Hata. 
  Kono had previously maintained that "what Ozawa has in mind 
is only how to retain his position of power." He once warned 
Michio Watanabe, who had indicated his desire to join Ozawa in 
seeking government rule, saying: "The man you are trying to join 
hands with is trying to destroy the LDP." 
<H5>  Strong Reaction Against Tactics </H5>
  "Pro-Ozawa" or anti-Ozawa?" The axis of the opposition which 
caused confusion in the political situation until the 
inauguration of the Hata cabinet was, more than anything else, 
"Ozawa's tactics and orientation." The sudden formation of the 
new faction "Kaishin" among the ruling parties by Ozawa et al 
led to the SDPJ's decision to leave the coalition is found in 
the tactics rather than in the confrontation over ideas and 
policies. 
  The SDPJ has become an opposition party. The possibility of 
an "LDP-SDPJ union" is also mentioned. However, there is no 
reason to expect that a "joint struggle" based on reaction 
against Ozawa's tactics alone will continue forever. There are 
many Dietmen within the LDP who also support the policies 
advocated by Ozawa--for example, his debate for a "ordinary 
nation" that will welcome international contribution in military 
actions. The LDP executive branch has tended in the past to 
avoid frontal argument against Ozawa's policy contentions. It 
stems from the fear that, if it intrudes, policy distortions 
will inevitably surface and could invite the party to split 
again in seeking solutions. 
  "The LDP has remained intact merely as a `ruling party' but 
with disparate ideas. After it lost its ruling power, those who 
could no longer tolerate the situation slipped away to join the 
administration parties. Unless some steps are taken soon, the 
party will only weaken." 
  Thus spoke an executive of the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction in 
self-derision while watching LDP deserters form the new party 
"Mirai" [Future] and the Liberal Party. 
  Being anti-Ozawa per se cannot constitute an axis for 
reorganization. Ideas and policies that form a "nucleus" are 
necessary to create a full-fledged framework. In that context, 
it was the aggregation of the "social democratic/liberal" forces 
that nebulously took form. 
<H5>  Aggregation of Liberals a Difficult Task </H5>
  On 27 April [1994] in a room at the National Diet Library, 
the following dialogue took place between Hiroyuki Sonoda, 
secretary general of Sakigake, and Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of the SDPJ. 
  [Sonoda] It is risky to join the LDP in its present state. 
  [Kubo] The SDPJ shares the same view. We prefer to emphasize 
cooperation with Sakigake party. 
  [Sonoda] In order to do so, the SDPJ must change 
drastically. 
  [Kubo] We understand that. 
  The six ruling parties and the LDP control about 200 seats 
respectively in the lower house. In contrast, the SDPJ and 
Sakigake together hold only about 90 seats. It sounds good to 
say that they hold the casting votes, but one false step could 
plunge them into oblivion in a whirl of reorganization. The key 
may be said to depend on whether they will be able to use the 
experience of the Hosokawa administration as a stepping stone 
and set a direction based on `realpolitik.' 
  The question is whether the "social democrats and liberals" 
can display a clear policy on such issues as the direction of 
welfare and obligation amid tax system reform and the 
relationship between the Constitution and interntional 
contribution. Rengo Chairman Yamagishi, who adopts a posture of 
support for the SDPJ, have any clear convictions, either. There 
is even a possibility that they will simply remain "reactionary" 
in opposition to the actions of Ozawa et al. 
<H5>  Watanage Is Unconvinced </H5>
  "Policies of the LDP and Shinseito are virtually identical. 
The shifting alignment of the political parties should have 
inherently depended on their policies." 
  It is reported that Watanabe, who ended up staying within 
the 
LDP, still gripes about his indeterminate feelings to the 
members of his faction. 
  Watanabe's abandonment of his decision to leave the LDP and 
the SDPJ's split from the coalition have further clouded the 
direction of political realignment. Political parties and Diet 
members must determine their positions before making their next 
moves. Will it be the "eradication of distorted policies" or 
"pro or con stance vis-a-vis Ozawa's methods?" The tide toward 
realignment also involves a quarrel over opposing axes. 
<H5>  [2 May 94 p 2] </H5>
  [Text] It was the forming of a new faction "Kaishin" that 
plunged the Hata administration into a minority ruling party. 
However, there was a foreshadowing event. Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito had thrust a "dagger" (Komeito 
Secretary Geneneral Yuichi Ichikawa) called "policy" in the face 
of the SDPJ that heated tensions to the boiling point. 
  On 18 April [1994] when policy discussions among the 
coalition ruling parties faced rough sailing, Ozawa met Hata at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told him: "I will do it. We 
may become a minority party. We could perhaps become an 
opposition party. Is that all right with you?" 
  The slogans of "political reform" and "non-LDP" that united 
the Hosokawa administration faded, and basic policy differences 
among the parties can no longer be kept secret. Meanwhile, 
Japan-U.S. economic relations and the issue of nuclear weapons 
development by the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [North 
Korea] are approaching dangerous waters for Japan's diplomacy. 
Unless its policies are solidified, the "Hata administration," 
which may be regarded as its final trump card, will soon find 
itself a blind alley. 
<H5>  All-Out Emphasis on U.S. Relations </H5>
  In the policy discussions, Ozawa strongly demanded an 
inclusion of specific responses to the Korean Peninsular problem 
including "emergency legislation." He refused to compromise on a 
hike in the consumption tax rate, giving the continuation of the 
tax reduction measure which had become a public half-promise to 
the United States as his premise. Providing the backdrop was his 
posture of an all-out emphasis on the U.S. relations and 
cooperations when he said: "After the Cold war, as long as Japan 
keeps relations with the United States as its axis, our tasks 
concerning national security and economic policy are clear." 
  For Ozawa, the policy problems are problems of content as 
well as problems of decisionmaking process. 
  The Hosokawa administration as an "eight-horse carriage" 
ranging from the Shinseito to the SDPJ with different 
backgrounds has paid a high price for political coordination. 
The government's response has been on the defensive, and the 
Gulf war experience of being viewed coldly by the international 
society flashes through Ozawa's mind. It is not surprising if he 
thought that the Hata administration cannot cope unless its mode 
of operation is changed 180 degrees and a Shinseito-led 
leadership is established. 
<H5>  Outlook of a "Ordinary Nation" </H5>
  In fact, this also constitutes the heart of the "political 
reform" envisioned by Ozawa. 
  Because of the introduction of the "political 
party-oriented" 
single-seat constituency system, the LDP-SDPJ "dango" politics 
under the 1955 political system and the LDP's "total mainstream 
faction" politics will be rejected with power concentrated on 
the prime minister and speedier political decisionmaking as 
principal aims. The outlook for the future is a Japan that 
transcends "one-nation pacifism" and becomes a "ordinary nation" 
actively involved in the world in security terms. 
  Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita explained the 
"essense" of LDP politics in a recent lecture. "I highly 
evaluate the postwar role played by the SDPJ. In our policy 
choices, it would be just right if we implement three years from 
now what the SDPJ says." 
  Meanwhile, in the "Ozawa-style politics," the desire is seen 
to realize in a purer form the policies which the LDP was 
compelled to advance in increments while paying consideration to 
the SDPJ. 
  The fact that Koji Kakizawa, who was appointed foreign 
minister soon after leaving the LDP, immediately advocated a 
change in the government's interpretation, contending that "the 
exercise of the right of collective defense is not permitted by 
the constitution," may be considered as an indication (of 
Ozawa's style). The kind of assurance that the 1955 system 
offered to the people, for better or worse, does not exist there. 
<H5>  Spreading Rumor of a Government Change in June </H5>
  However, the SDPJ's split from the coalition immediately 
pushed the policy evolvement, which was targeted by Ozawa and 
embraced by Prime Minister Hata in terms of its direction, into 
a murky zone. In the political circles, a view is rapidly 
spreading that the Hata administration will last at best until 
the passing of FY94 budget and "a change in government in June" 
is publicly rumored. 
  At a press conference after his inauguration, the prime 
minister indicated his strong desire for a breakthrough in 
Japan-U.S. relations. However, a powerful administrative base is 
indispensable to change the economic structure through a 
continuing large-scale tax reduction and deregulation, which are 
decisive factors for trade surplus reduction, including a rein 
on the bureaucracy. There is also deep apprehension that how far 
the prime minister is being seriously considered as the 
counterpart in negotiations by the United States, which feels 
uneasy about the Hata administration's future. 
  There is a strong view that the confused political situation 
will continue for several months, with hints of a dissolution 
and a general election. Meanwhile, there are no signs of 
business recovery, improvement of Japan-U.S. relations has 
stalled, and the situation in the Korean peninsula is fraught 
with tensions. 
  The price paid by the prime minister and Ozawa is enormous.

<F P=106> [Article by AERA editorial board staff member Nobuo </F>
Kobayashi: "180 Days of Discord Between Ozawa and Yamagishi"] 
  [Text] It seems that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, the strongman of the Hata 
administration, and Chairman Akira Yamagishi of the Japan Trade 
Union Confederation [Rengo], a big organization of eight million 
members, are generally thought to be on friendly terms with each 
other. 
  However, Shinseito, Nihon Shinto [Japan New Party], the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and others formed a new 
parliamentary group Kaishin [Renovation] on 25 April, 
immediately after the nomination of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
When the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] bolted from 
the coalition government in opposition to the formation of 
Kaishin on the following day, 26 April, Chairman Yamagishi said 
at once at a press conference concerning SDPJ's action: "I can 
understand the SDPJ's action and would like to support it." 
That remark made one wonder: "Has his relationship with Ozawa 
changed?" 
  When asked about the matter, Chairman Yamagishi said in 
reply: "Ozawa is a neo-conservative and I am a social democrat. 
From the beginning he has lived on the other side of the river, 
and I have come more and more to feel the distance." 
  In April, three attempts were made to arrange a meeting 
between the two men, but Chairman Yamagishi refused all of them. 
It is said that not only has Yamagishi never had a meeting with 
Ozawa since the beginning of this year, but also that he has not 
talked with Ozawa over the telephone at all. 
  Ozawa and Yamagishi played the lead roles in establishing 
the 
Hosokawa coalition government last summer, which put an end to 
the one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
However, it seems that the relationship between the two men has 
completely cooled, judging from Yamagishi's remarks. Are they 
really at odds with each other? 
  Let us set the hands of the clock back one year. On 20 
February last year, Ozawa and Yamagishi had a meeting. That was 
an important move which heralded the collapse of the LDP 
administration. The meeting was arranged by Tokai University 
Professor Kenzo Uchida, who is a common friend of the two men 
and one of the brains of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Ozawa told Yamagishi that the then Hata faction was 
determined to bolt from the LDP, and Yamagishi promised Ozawa 
that he would exercise his influence over the SDPJ. Thus, they 
reached a fundamental agreement concerning the establishment of 
a non-LDP coalition government. Professor Uchida says: "It is 
like the alliance between Satsuma and Choshu in the Meiji 
Restoration. Each had his own intentions and the two men got on 
well with each other until the passage of political reform 
bills." 
  The two men then had two meetings after the establishment of 
the Hosokawa administration, but, as Yamagishi says, they have 
not met since 16 December last year. 
  In fact, a meeting was once arranged for the two men on 4 
March this year. A mediator at that time was Dietman Akira 
Fukida, who was a leader of the Kato group built around 
Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato. Kato and others joined 
Shinseito in April, but they were regarded as "Ozawa's detached 
force" at that time. However, the Ozawa side asked for a 
postponement just before the scheduled meeting, and talks 
through this route were stopped. 
  At that time, the problem of the reshuffle of the cabinet 
was 
on the boil. It is not clear why the meeting was postponed and 
came to naught. When urged to have a meeting again and again by 
different sources, Yamagishi betrayed his strong dissatisfaction 
by saying: "Ozawa is rude and is contemplating divide-and-rule 
tactics." 
  Then came the post-Hosokawa period in April. Yamagishi named 
three mediators: besides Professor Uchida mentioned above, 
Rengo Secretary General Etsuya Washio, a strongman in Rengo, and 
Chairman Mototaka Ito of the Japan Postal Workers' Union.

  [Text] According to Yamagishi, when former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa announced his resignation on the night of 8 
April, Uchida and Washio one after the next asked Yamagishi over 
the phone to have a meeting with Ozawa. Four days later, on 12 
April, Ito met with Yamagishi in person and urged him to meet 
with Ozawa. 
  Uchida says: "I often told Yamagishi that 'it is about time 
to meet with Ozawa.' Yamagishi must have had a feeling that 'it 
is that guy who canceled the meeting, though he is a mere 
stripling.'" 
  About that time, the Ozawa side seemed to have a motive to 
arrange a meeting between the two men in order to prevent the 
move toward "a union between the LDP and the SDPJ, because it 
was thought that that union could be effected only through the 
mediation of Yamagishi, if it was to be effected at all. The 
circles close to Ozawa asked for Ito's cooperation by 
whispering: "We have positive evidence that Yamagishi is 
working for a union between the LDP and the SDPJ." 
  Ito explains the situation: "Ozawa asked me to arrange a 
meeting with Yamagishi because he had something to explain. 
Ozawa wanted to know if he could obtain a promise that the tax 
problem could be solved within the year in policy discussion 
with the SDPJ." 
  At the meeting of Yamagishi and Ito on 12 April, it was 
decided after all that "now is not the time for a meeting 
between Ozawa and Yamagishi." Three days later, on 15 April, 
Ito met with Yamagishi again, and after saying that "he will 
meet with Ozawa tomorrow," he had a meeting with Ozawa at All 
Nippon Airline's hotel in Tokyo on the following day, 16 April. 
The exact contents of the meeting are not known, but it seems 
that a discussion was held concerning the evaluation of the 
LDP's Michio Watanabe, the former deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister. 
  Incidentally, Washio, another mediator, is said to be the 
leader of the next generation in Rengo as well as a strong rival 
of Yamagishi. Moreover, Washio has close ties to Ozawa and is a 
positive advocate of political alignment. 
  Yamagishi is a born member of the SDPJ and has a deep 
feeling 
toward the SDPJ, while Washio's generation, which is twelve 
years younger than Yamagishi's, is gradually losing nostalgia 
for the SDPJ. The Japanese Federation of Iron and Steel 
Workers' Unions, of which Washio is chairman, conducted in the 
last year's general election "selective recommendation" in order 
to exclude SDPJ left- wing members from recommendation, and 
recommended, instead, five candidates from Shinseito. 
  When Ozawa asked for additional assistance, Washio gave him 
a 
forward-looking answer: "I will ask some of our locals to give 
their cooperation to Shinseito's candidates." 
  It is no wonder that Washio's and Ito's action as 
intermediaries for arranging a meeting between Yamagishi and 
Ozawa seemed to Yamagishi as Ozawa's intervention in Rengo. 
That is what Yamagishi means by "divide and rule." 
  Yamagishi explains the reason for his refusal to meet with 
Ozawa: "I am conducting legitimate self-defense against a 
surprise attack aimed at inducing the breakup of the SDPJ and at 
luring some of the right-wing members of the party. Moreover, 
if the cheerleader of the SDPJ meets with Ozawa, that will incur 
distrust." 
  However, he is very shrewd because he conveyed an unofficial 
message to the Ozawa side at the same time: "I am not saying 
that I will not meet with Ozawa." Yamagishi has not discarded 
"the Ozawa card," and Diet upper house member Sadao Hirano, a 
close aid to Ozawa, holds the view that the relationship between 
the two men is not thoroughly estranged. Hirano says: "The two 
men are fully aware of each other's political power. However, 
to think of the labor union is one thing, to think of Japan is 
another. When Ozawa had to make a decision under the 
restriction of time, that may have appeared too hasty to 
Yamagishi."

  [Text] Meanwhile, Ozawa, too, is conducting underground 
activities toward the LDP, holding "the Yamagishi card." 
  What has happened to the relationship between the two men 
since the SDPJ left the government? "Kaishin went so far as to 
expel the SDPJ. We are now on fighting terms with Ichi-Ichi 
[Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa]." 
  When such remarks by Yamagishi were leaked out to Nagata-cho 
[the center of Japan's politics], those who were looking forward 
to "a general election through the coalition of the LDP and the 
SDPJ under the multiseat constituency system" were encouraged, 
and SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama advocated "dissolution of 
the House of Representatives through mutual consent." 
  Meanwhile, Yamagishi was writing a different scenario, 
displaying "the LDP card." The plan was to push for 
resignation, through the pressure of Yuaikai, which is a pro-DSP 
[Democratic Socialist Party] labor union within Rengo, and DSP 
Chairman Keigo Ouchi, who took action to form "Kaishin." That 
was to shake Ozawa up and at the same time to pave the way for 
the SDPJ to return to the coalition government. Then, on 16 
May, Yamagishi said to DSP Dietman Eisei Ito and others, "The 
Hata administration will remain a minority government unless it 
resigns en masse and makes a fresh start." This remark was made 
five days before SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo made the 
same remark. 
  In opposition to Yamagishi's speech and conduct aiming at 
both "dissolution" and "returning the SDPJ to the coalition 
government," the general tendency within Rengo was against "the 
union between the LDP and the SDPJ." At the meeting of Rengo's 
Central Executive Committee, held on 19 May, all joined in to 
swell the chorus of calls for "a flat no to the union between 
the LDP and the SDPJ." Some leaders of Rengo testified that "the 
purpose of the meeting was to contain Yamagishi." It is not 
clear whether Ozawa moved behind the scenes. 
  Meanwhile, Ozawa's footing is no longer as firm as it used 
to 
be. Concerning the formation of "Kaishin" and the SDPJ's 
withdrawal from the coalition government, former Economic 
Planning Agency Director General Koichiro Aino, a leader of 
Shinseito, said, "Ozawa committed a gross blunder." 
  This is the first time that Ozawa was publicly criticized by 
name within Shinseito. On 19 May, Aino was released by Ozawa 
from the post of chief director of the Lower House's Committee 
on Rules and Administration. That night, Keiwa Okuda, chairman 
of the Lower House's Committee on Rules and Administration, is 
said to have said in excitement, "Why did Ozawa fire my 
right-hand man without prior consultation? I can never tolerate 
such a thing." Okuda is, in effect, the most influential man 
after Ozawa in Shinseito. Aino, who is Okuda's confident, says 
in a casual manner, "Ozawa the Terrible is the image made by the 
media. Younger members have ceased to be afraid of Ozawa 
because I do not fear him." 
  Now, on 26 May, the Political Reform Promotion Council [Ad 
Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform], consisting of members 
of business and labor, announced such emergency proposals as the 
"holding of a general election under the new system." In 
response to this, on the same day 88 supra-party Diet members, 
excepting members of the Japan Communist Party, became promoters 
and engaged in a signature-collecting campaign "against a 
general election under the current multiseat constituency 
system," which was to be completed by 10 June. At a press 
conference of the Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform, 
Professor Uchida and Rengo Acting Chairman Jinnosuke Ashida were 
present. It is said that it was DSP Secretary General Takashi 
Yonezawa who asked Washio to restore a good relationship between 
Ozawa and Yamagishi. Ashida is the top leader of Yuaikai which 
supports Yonezawa. Those who mediated for a meeting between 
Ozawa and Yamagishi are also advocates of political reform. 
  Ouchi expressed his intention to resign as chairman of the 
DSP on 1 June. Yonezawa, who had acted as a liaison in the 
formation of "Kaishin," was elected as the next chairman and 
Ouchi was made a scapegoat. On the following day, 2 June, at a 
meeting of Rengo's central committee, Yamagishi highly evaluated 
Ouchi's resignation, saying, "I hope that the SDPJ will present 
its political ideas and return to the non-LDP coalition 
government as soon as possible. 
  This can be construed to mean that Yamagishi has shown a 
sign 
for the restoration of a good relationship with Ozawa.

  [Text] The nuclear power subcommittee (whose chairman is 
Yoshihiko Morozumi, an adviser to the Electric Power Development 
Co.) of the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory organ to 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], 
released on 10 June an interim report proposing revisions to the 
nuclear cycle. The proposals included one for putting off 
operating a second reprocessing plant for extracting plutonium 
from spent nuclear fuel. The government's Atomic Energy 
Commission is presently working to revise its long-term plan to 
use nuclear power and on 22 June is planning to decide on 
revising the nuclear fuel cycle. The government's position -- 
which has been positive on using plutonium as a fuel made, in a 
sense, in Japan -- has greatly changed direction. 
  The subcommittee's report also takes into consideration the 
growing international concern regarding nuclear proliferation as 
the result of such issues as the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea's (North Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
In addition, the urgency of the plan to use plutonium has waned 
with the easing of the uranium supply, which has slowed down the 
plan. Concerning the nuclear fuel cycle, the report calls for 
expanding the production of enriched uranium to fuel nuclear 
reactors. On the other hand, the report postpones the planned 
second reprocessing plant, for which the plan until now had been 
to commence operations around the year 2010.

"Bureaucrats and the Coalition": "Lack of Progress in 
`Deregulation' and 'Decentralization'"] 
  [Text] On 13 May, the following conversation took place 
between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Daiei's Chairman and 
President Isao Nakauchi when he visited the prime minister's 
official residence bearing a Keidanren [Federation of Economic 
Organizations] petition for relaxation of government regulations. 
  [Prime Minister] "I need you to do what you can to eliminate 
the discrepancies between domestic and foreign prices." 
  [Nakauchi] "But the Finance Ministry is keeping an eye on us 
on beer [prices]." 
<H5>  Dissatisfaction With Lower Beer Prices </H5>
  On 14 April, Daiei reduced domestic beer prices by 7 
percent. 
Daiei has maintained its lowered retail prices despite the 1 May 
rise in the liquor tax, in what was a strong competitive blow to 
smaller and mid-sized liquor retail outlets. According to 
Nakauchi, the action even had reverberations within the Ministry 
of Finance's National Tax Administration Agency, which oversees 
the industry. 
  Officials of the National Tax Administration Agency's 
Alcoholic Beverage Tax Division maintain, "Beer is priced by 
open market forces. We cannot interfere." However, keeping 
prices low in the face of the division's instruction that the 
impact of increased taxes be passed on to the consumer certainly 
had to annoy the bureaucrats. Even though Nakauchi is 
championing the cause of lower prices as Keidanren's vice 
president in charge of administrative reforms, there are 
whispers in Kasumigaseki that "He is just trying to expand sales 
for his own retail operation." 
  "Last summer, large retail outlets of over 10,000 square 
meters in size were granted licenses through a special exemption 
clause. A further easing of regulations is uncalled for." On 
12 May, the day before Nakauchi met with the prime minister, the 
National Tax Administration Agency rejected seven separate 
petitions for deregulation on liquor sales at a session of the 
"Import Expansion, Improving Market Access and Distribution" 
working subcommittee of the Promotion Headquarters for 
Administrative Reform held at the prime minister's official 
residence. 
  At the working subcommittee session, eight government 
ministries and agencies concerned agreed to "take positive 
steps" on only two of the 71 proposals on the distribution 
sector made by a private sector hoping for deregulation. It was 
evident that in all areas, there is a deeply rooted resistance 
to any actual loosening of control. 
<H5>  Recommendations Outside Jurisdiction </H5>
  The passive attitude of the various government agencies 
toward deregulation has become more pronounced with the advent 
of the Hata administration. "To facilitate any easing of 
regulations, some guarantee of the political authorities' 
determination to immplement such measures is necessary, but that 
is improbable in the current situation where the budget is not 
even passed, " (a senior Ministry of Construction official) 
voiced cynical insight into the dubious footing of the minority 
coalition government. 
  In the midst of this, the machinations of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry are elaborately orchestrated. 
In 16 areas where it has no jurisdiction, such as in rice and 
liquor sales, the ministry presented a mid-May report 
recommending a sweeping easing of regulations. The senior 
officials of the ministry have even personally approached the 
working subcommittee's experts from academia and the business 
sector. 
  In lieu of offering a menu of choices to the experts and the 
prime minister, who are looking for impressive deregulation 
measures, the ministry has adopted a strategy to win acceptance 
of its own plan to "gradually ease regulations" under its 
jurisdiction, such as those embodied in the Large Retail Store 
Law. 
  However, inasmuch as deregulation is part of international 
commitments, the pressure for them nonetheless persists. In the 
final stage, the bureaucrats are inwardly prepared to table at 
least some minor deregulation measures as they stage a game of 
"awaiting the prime minister's political decision." 
  What the central government ministries and agencies 
vehemently oppose is the decentralization of government powers. 
<H5>  Finally Eviscerating the Legal Provisions </H5>
  "In the end, we had no choice but to compromise." So say 
Ministry of Home Affairs senior officials looking back on their 
struggle since January to liaise with other ministries and 
government bureaus in seeking to establish "regional 
amalgamation." 
  Regional amalgamation will be established by the amendment 
of 
the Local Government Act, enabling various prefectural-level 
governments or municipalities to work together on issues such as 
refuse disposal. The pillar of regional amalgamation was its 
ability to demand that the central government delegate authority. 
  However, the overwhelming resistance from the other 
ministries has resulted in the appendage of numerous provisions 
enhancing central government involvement to the proposed bill. 
In the final draft, requests to delegate authority can only be 
granted for "powers closely related to regional amalgamation." 
  The negotiations between the various ministries and agencies 
overlapped the final days of the Hosokawa administration and the 
birth of the Hata administration. Evidence of active leadership 
by the Prime Minister's Office was barely visible. 
  The issue of information disclosure is as prominent as the 
issue of decentralization. Koshiro lshida, director general of 
the Management and Coordination Agency, has recently started to 
emphasize that the proposed reforms will be "the most sweeping 
reforms in half a century." Nobuyoshi Namikawa, secretary 
general of the People's Conference on Administrative Reform, is 
worried: "That is what bureaucrats say when they mean, `We are 
not going to make this easy'."

Land Agency: "Revive Japanese Economy Through Creativity; The 
Key Is Improved Productivity"] 
  [Text] When Japan's productivity per unit-time is 
compared with Europe and the United States, it ranks the lowest. 
There is no future for Japan's economy without overcoming its 
low productivity. How can the productivity be raised? This 
writer proposes not the TQC [total quality control] which led 
Japan's postwar economy to success, but TPC [total productivity, 
creativity encouragement], which is a newly coined term that 
appeals for the formation of a high system of creativity. 
<H5>  Low Labor Productivity </H5>
  Japan's economy today may be said to be in considerably 
serious circumstances compared with other postwar periods. It is 
caused by high costs of manufacturing and low productivities of 
the service industries. Without surmounting them, there can be 
no medium or long-term breakthrough for Japan's economy. The 
only solution is to raise the per-hour productivity per worker. 
  In Japan's case, growth rate of its workers and average 
annual total work hours by the workers are gradually declining. 
In order to increase the gross domestic product [GDP], it is 
necessary to raise the productivity beyond offsetting the 
decline. 
  When the unit-time productivity per worker is compared with 
major nations of Europe and the United States (OECD purchasing 
power, parity-base), the trend is gradually upward, it still 
remains in the lowest position. Conversely, the annual total 
work hours are the longest among the major nations. Moreover, 
the commuting time is also the longest. 
  The Japan's livelihood-related asset-and-service price level 
is said to be high internationally and that is partly because of 
its high land prices. However, the fundamental factor is its low 
productivity. It is also because of the low rate of 
capitalization for informationalization of the POS [point of 
sale] system and the EOS [supplementary ordering system]. In 
addition, although the productivity of manufacturing industries 
is considerably higher than tertiary industries, it is low 
compared to major Western nations except for a portion of the 
production workplaces. The reasons are: long work hours, 
substantively low wages followed by high service costs for 
distribution, and excessive indirect personnel. 
  In any case, with the bubble era as a watershed, Japan's 
manufacturing industries once viewed as the world's top find 
themselves in dire circumstances because of high costs stemming 
from surplus plant-and-equipment and personnel, a sharp drop in 
demand, and the impact of a high yen, in addition to 
dissemination in the West of production methods once considerd 
as Japan's forte. 
  The point of economic structural reform is how to minimize 
the gap between the purchasing power parity (currently about $1 
= 190 yen) and the foreign exchange rate. For example, assuming 
that the purchasing power parity is $1 = 150 yen, Japan's 
productivity will rise by slightly under 30 percent to reach 
above 90 percent of the U.S. productivity. Methods to reduce 
the gap are as follows: 1) Promote import of livelihood assets, 
materials, and parts by utilizing the high yen, 2) reverse 
import of finished products and parts by shifting production 
overseas, 3) avoid high-yen pressures by reducing the current 
account surplus, and 4) improve productivity in the service 
industries and the manufacturing industries. Both 1 and 2 have 
been implemented in the past and will probably accelerate in the 
future. As a result, they will be tied to 3. The formidable 
task is how to improve productivity in 4. 
<H5>  Reexamination of Labor Practices </H5>
  Consequently, the way of living, labor practices, commercial 
practices, and corporate practices of the Japanese people must 
change. These tasks have become possible under the changes in 
current circumstances that include a torrid international 
economic environment, a rebellion by consumers, and the changes 
in value concepts of the Japanese people. 
  The changes in value concepts of the Japanese are rooted in 
a 
desire for freedom (liberation from shackles), a desire for 
friendship and association, and a rise in "self first." They 
appear from the standpoint of youths, for example, as a 
decreasing desire to belong to an organization (a rise of those 
desiring change in employment and those changing employment), 
changes in life outlook (manifesting one's own abilities as a 
part of life as contrasted to working as a company person, 
emphasis on a lifestyle to suit one's tastes), an increase among 
males with emphasis on the home, leisure time as a priority in 
one's livelihood, greater weight on leisure and sports, and 
enhanced concern about health and environment. 
  Modernization of awareness and value concepts among the 
Japanese is thus moving forward. However, individual needs that 
emanate from such value concepts are still not satisfied. 
According to a public opinion poll, reasons for dissatisfaction 
regarding leisure activities include a lack of everyday free 
time or a lack of extended vacations and holidays. The energy 
spent toward fulfilling those needs could provide momentum for 
improvement of unit-time productivity and a major change in the 
domestic-type industrial structure. 
  How do we organically combine "self-realization," "authority 
and responsibility," "tension and release," "power of 
concentration," "creativity," and "approach to the consumer" to 
organize a highly creative system? Among the component elements 
of productivity, how do we compress the ratio of personnel 
costs, and how do we enhance values (profits) based on 
creativity? What must we do concretely to improve corporate 
creativity? The principal directions are as follows: 
  1) Streamline the upper echelons of the management sector 
through staff minimization and thus form a strong leadership 
abounding in creativity. Management must detect the deep and 
true currents and focus on the people, return to the point of 
origin of the organization, indicate directions and visions, and 
resolutely implement bold operational reforms from within in 
order to boost creativity. 
  2) Strengthen planning and R&amp;D capabilities. For this 
purpose, a climate of utilizing and nurturing workers of 
superior talent and innovation is demanded. 
  3) Simplify and shorten decisionmaking processes within the 
organization. Respond swiftly by reducing unnecessary checks and 
controls and by clarifying responsible persons without having 
them lean on each other. 
  4) Transfer authority to subordinates and persons in charge, 
or to subsidiaries, plants, and responsible sectors. Although 
this will incur greater responsibility, it will also invoke 
greater initiative and volition. 
  5) Emphasize results through work evaluation. For the 
intellectual workers, "creativity" through "concentration" is 
the decisive factor between success and failure regardless of 
the time factor. A fair evaluation of the results inspires 
morale and creates a favorable cycle in producing further 
favorable results. 
  6) Shorten the sales channels, and unify manufacture and 
sales. Swift response will be possible through reduction of 
distribution costs and understanding of needs of the consumers 
and clients. 
  7) Promote reduction of work hours. Recreation is 
indispensable for creativity, and it is important to provide an 
environment and work arrangement by utilizing paid vacations 
which tend to be underused. 
  8) Use information machines and instruments effectively and 
develop software. Not only can it provide efficient and improved 
standard business affairs through concentrated management, but 
it will also facilitate intellectual support for non-standard 
business affairs and a systematic networking of individual 
knowledge. 
<H5>  Enhancement of Morale </H5>
  These measures help to encourage individuals to respond to 
the trends of the times such as decentralization of authority, 
individualization, and independence. It is also important to 
conduct a general check of the production process which is the 
source of a strong manufacturing industry whether any problems 
exist including the morale of workers. Also, while reengineering 
has recently been in the limelight, its popularity is conversely 
accompanied by a sense of anxiety. It is necessary to pay full 
attnetion to the following points. First, the terminology is not 
appropriate, and it carries a strong inorganic sense of emphasis 
on information machines and equipment and less emphasis on 
humans. Second, because of the emphasis on improving medium and 
long-term efficiency, the medium- and long-term research themes 
tend to be overlooked. Third, the United States has inherently 
been strong in creativity and stresses elimination of waste. 
  Today half a century after the World War II, the Japanese 
are 
enjoying material affluence and are finally beginning to move 
toward mental freedom. The companies and organizations comprised 
of such Japanese find it necessary to devise various 
organizational schemes to bring out maximum use of potential 
talent while considering the independence, sense of 
self-sufficiency, and fulfillment of the workers. This is not an 
idealistic theory. In fact, the companies that are prospering 
despite the major recession have and are implementing a new 
sense of management concept. A representative example is as 
follows. 
  Company A (a chemical company with partial listing, less 
than 
1,000 employees) is improving its productivity while increasing 
its profits and continues to boost its earnings/profits. 
Compared to the overall manufacturing industry, its 
capitalization and profit rate are also high. In addition, it is 
coping aggressively with reduction of work hours. In order to 
encourage planned cutbacks in overtime and use of vacations, 
with the promotion of thorough analysis of each worker's duties 
and office automation, the annual total work hours last year was 
slightly above l,830 hours or about 130 hours less than the 
manufacturing industry as a whole. Incidentally, the per 
unit-time productivity in FY92 was about 50 percent above the 
overall manufacturing industry. 
  The secret of its progress is a powerful leadership with 
high 
creativity, a client-oriented management posture, high worker 
morale based on transfer of authority to those in charge, 
thorough pragmatism and efforts to reduce costs (the sales 
plateau price-ratio dropped about five points in the past five 
years and fell below the 50-percent level), capability to 
develop new products through emphasis on R&amp;D, and unity of 
manufacturing and sales. In addition, it should be specially 
pointed out that about a quarter of all its employees were 
deployed with priority in the R&amp;D and new project sectors 
following an overall reexamination of business affairs and 
expansion of information systems. These aspects are generally 
held in common in other smoothly operating companies. 
  Japan's economy as a whole lags far behind Europe and the 
United States. We should work to create new industries with high 
productivity, centering on the so-called service industries in 
the developing stage. It is important to thus elevate overall 
productivity. Furthering the services and software aspects of 
the economy will be inevitable in the future. Development in 
advanced tertiary industries which provide high-level services 
at relatively low prices must be promoted in a diversified range 
of personal needs including health, medical care, leisure time 
and activities, sports, shopping, academic studies, and safety. 
  These areas have recently expanded their market scale. For 
example, sales in areas close at home such as home-nursing care, 
bathing services, baby-sitting, "karaoke" boxes, TV games 
(particularly software), general sports facilities, cultural 
classrooms, and security services have grown markedly. Also 
drastic modal changes are taking place in retail industries. 
With new types of convenience stores and discount stores as 
their engines, overall productivity is rising and employment is 
expanding. A proper environment to promote such trends is 
necessary. In other words, in addition to reexamination of the 
regulations, it is urgent that we strengthen and expand such 
infrastructures as advanced information and communications, 
livelihood, transportation, and research, and support pioneers. 
It is also important to utilize the foreign capital and the 
wisdom of foreigners who have advanced into these areas. The 
National Land Agency is currently following up the 4th national 
general development plan and the capital region basic plan 
drafted in the late 1980's and is reviewing them with care. 
<H5>  Recommendation of TPC </H5>
  The development of advanced tertiary industries is also 
linked to the revival of manufacturing industries. This is 
because reduction of service costs that depend on the outside, 
the supply of high-value capital assets and systems, and 
participation in new businesses based on the use of superior 
human resources become feasible. 
  Japan as a whole forms a well-balanced chain from 
"productivity improvement per unit-time" and "promotion of 
reduced work hours (raise of hourly pay)" to "increase of free 
time" to "fulfilment of personal needs." In other words, if 
reform on the supplier side progresses, the conditions to 
satisfy personal needs on the consumer side are in order. That 
is, the aim is to "work (study) well, and play well." 
  It means that "productivity improvement per unit-time" 
contributes not only to competitiveness and growth of Japan's 
economy but also to expansion of domestic demand by satisfying 
personal needs and to change in the domestic demand-type of 
industrial structure. We would like to call the series of 
measures for productivity improvement per unit-time toward these 
targets TPC [total productivity, creativity encouragement] after 
Japan's once-successful TQC [total quality control]. Perhaps now 
is the time to boost a TPC movement among the people nationwide, 
focusing on the organizational managment aspects of individual 
awareness, behavior, and enterprise.

  [Text] Companies have begun facing the problems of 
"labor liabilities" such as retirement benefits and pensions for 
their employees. With their employment adjustments, payments to 
those retiring are growing sharply and generating huge special 
losses. Until now, they have gotten by somehow by disposing of 
assets or borrowing from banks, but there is no guarantee that 
those methods will work indefinitely. It is time to pay the 
piper for the contradictions of lifetime employment and the 
seniority pay system that had been put off to the future. 
<H5>  Companies That Have Been Lucky </H5>
  Since the end of 1993, president Kenji Kano of the big 
software developer INES has repeatedly been told, "I want to 
know why you have cut your staff back so much." 
  In November 1993 the company sought voluntary resignations 
and 302 persons responded. Before that 250 people had resigned 
for their own reasons, and by the start of the first quarter of 
1994, one-fourth of its staff of 2,067 had left the company. 
  The reason such a large staff cutback possible is that 
average employee age is a young 30 years. Employees who resigned 
were mainly those in their 20's who had been with the company 
two to four years. Including bonuses, total payments for 
resignation allowances came to 1.44 billion yen (2.6 million yen 
per person). One can see how light that burden was if it is 
compared to the total of 3.6 billion yen (12.2 million yen per 
person) that Shokusan Jutaku Sogo Co., Ltd. paid last June after 
soliciting 250 voluntary resignations among those mainly in 
their 50's. 
  It was also lucky that much of the 14.3 billion yen procured 
in a publicly offered new stock issue in March 1990 still 
remained as current deposits and had not been put into 
facilities investment under the business recession followed 
immediately. 
  Listed firms that have cut staff by more than 100 by 
soliciting voluntary resignations exceeded 20 in fiscal year 
1993 alone, but few companies covered resignation bonuses from 
funds on hand as INES did. Even in the software industry, where 
it is said that "some 10 percent of employees have no work," 
making up funds for resignation bonuses is a bottleneck and one 
sees no firms resolutely cutting back staff. 
  How do companies that have solicited voluntary resignations 
usually cope with the financial aspects? A typical example of 
that is Tamura Electric Works, Ltd., which solicited voluntary 
resignations in the summer of 1992. 
  This company paid out a total of 7 billion yen to 698 
persons 
resigning voluntarily (36 percent of its total staff). To cope 
with this, it raised 3 billion yen by selling off land, golf 
course memberships, and borrowed the remainder from a number of 
banks including its main-force Fuji Bank. 
  The handling for accounting purposes is that 3 billion yen 
in 
normal resignation bonuses is written off as resignation payroll 
reserves. The extra 4 billion yen in resignation bonuses is 
counted as a special loss, taking the form of a partial covering 
of losses by extra profits from the asset disposal gain. 
  Ordinary resignation fund reserves, which are an item on 
balance sheets, also have not actually been secured as funds on 
hand. Therefore, says General Affairs Division Chief Minoru 
Takahashi, it was necessary that "with deciding to solicit 
voluntary resignations, our officers went around" seeking the 
cooperation of the banks at the same time. 
  Denki Kagaku Kogyo, which October 1993 solicited voluntary 
resignations (382 persons), and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing, 
which made a solicitation January 1994 (297 persons), procured 
their resignation bonus funds--2.2 and 1.8 billion yen 
respectively--by selling off idle assets and getting the banks' 
cooperation. 
<H5>  Hard To Borrow From Banks </H5>
  Lately, cases have begun emerging in which companies are 
being forced to do last-resort fund procurement to pay 
resignation bonuses. To cover the procurement for, and special 
losses accompanying its solicitation of 178 voluntary 
resignations, Orient Watch Co., Ltd. sold off its main factory 
in Hino City, Tokyo, March 1994. It sold its storage area, 
amounting to one-third of its acreage to Seiko-Epson, its 
number-two stockholder, for over 3.1 billion yen (a disposal 
gain of 2.9 billion yen), and by leasing this back it has 
continued operations. The company holds 5 billion yen of its 
stock by book value, but as of late September 1993 was holding 
1.7 billion yen in latent losses. Even as it defers personnel 
adjustments, its asset value is dropping and a company executive 
says, "In a situation where we have no prospect for earnings 
recovery, it is hard to borrow even from banks." 
  There are more companies which, separately from the firms' 
own finances, hold in trust as "pensions" the funds for needed 
for future resignation bonuses. Yet, the problem of operating 
stagnation even in company pensions is quite onerous. The totals 
for company pensions grow year by year and had reached a scale 
of 50 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993. However, if 
adjusted for market price, some 2.8 trillion yen is gone with 
the wind due to the effects of stock-price stagnation. 
<H5>  If Environment Deteriorates... </H5>
  Nagasakiya Co., Ltd., whose unprecedentedly expensive 
resignation bonuses were so much discussed, seems currently to 
be carrying latent losses close to 10 percent in qualified 
pensions accumulating to 19 billion yen. With a total of some 10 
billion yen in resignation funds, including pensions, to be 
disbursed by 17 April [1994], the company will be drawing down 
over 2 billion yen in pension assets. But it is also possible 
that it will force loss- cutting on its stock, and if it tries 
to avoid that, its latent loss would expand even more. 
  Although a glimmer of light has become visible in the 
business climate, few forecast a rapid recovery in business 
earnings. It even seems likely that there will be more 
corporations unable to come back without restructuring that 
includes employment adjustments. Unprepared firms are raising 
the funds after undergoing great difficulty, but if the 
environment worsens, it may even become an actual matter of not 
meeting "labor liabilities." 
<H5>  [14 Apr 94 p 17] </H5>
  [Text] In the December quarter of 1993, Japan IBM 
effected a personnel reduction of some 3,000 persons, amounting 
to over a 10 percent of its whole staff. Its total payout of 
resignation funds, including the portion for pensions, is 
unknown; but under special losses in the name of resignation 
funds, it tallied 45 billion yen. This is mainly payments of 
extra retirement bonuses and payments to employees under 50 
years of age who are not eligible for qualified pensions. 
<H5>  "Total Amount From Current Deposits" </H5>
  Its allowances for resignation bonuses are under the same 
dual system as other Japanese firms: resignation payment 
reserves and pensions. "We are guided by our parent company in 
the United States and do the management of resignation expenses 
strictly, having kept a setup for covering the total amount by 
drawing it down from current deposits," says Katsunori Asakura, 
deputy chief for financial fund planning. The company made no 
asset sales in the previous quarter, and its long- and 
short-term debts are being reduced so that it takes the form of 
internal procurement which copes by making a 35.7 billion yen 
cut in inventory. 
  In general, U.S. firms have larger allowances for 
resignation 
expenses than Japanese firms. the U.S. Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) requires for fixed-benefit type pensions 
that differences between the current valuation of pension assets 
and the amount payable, which estimates future pay raises also, 
be accounted as that quarter's pension expenses. When the actual 
contributed amount exceeds the pension expenses in the account, 
the difference is added to assets as a prepaid expense. 
Conversely, when a sum less than pension expenses is 
contributed, the shortfall is added to liabilities as an unpaid 
expense. In corporate accounting, obligations to employees are 
actively maintained. 
  When Japanese firms make employment adjustments, one reason 
for their cash position troubles is their inadequate 
accumulation of resignation payment reserves. Certified public 
accountant Ikuo Nishikawa criticizes that inadequacy, saying, 
"Japanese resignation expense reserves do not make a projected 
calculation using actuarial statistics but have merely gone back 
to current values under a set discount rate for the sum needed 
for payment at quarter's end." 
  In actuality, too, there are many companies which adopt, as 
is, the tax law standard that accepts as a loss up to 40 percent 
of the amount to be paid at quarter's end. This is calculated by 
postulating the sum to be paid should all employees resign at 
the end of a certain quarter with 12 years of remaining service, 
discounted at a rate of 8 percent. The possibility is high that 
accumulations will be inadequate simply from not considering 
such things as future pay increases. 
  Limitations have also been pointed to in the aspect of 
securing funds accumulated in readiness for future payments. 
Professor Aishi Imafuku of Nihon University says, "The funds 
reserved are directed into one investment or another; and, with 
reductions in the investment value of land or stocks, instances 
are emerging of the basic assets of resignation funds becoming 
inadequate." 
  Managing Director Yoichi Sugimoto of the Japan Securities 
Industry Welfare Pension Fund, controlling the pension assets 
for some 150,000 persons working in securities firms, asserts, 
"The biggest issue for Japan's company pensions is asset 
management by book value." Not a few pension funds even carry 
latent losses. 
  Over the past several years, U.S. companies have tallied 
huge 
deficits and pushed forward with bold restructuring. The U.S. 
IBM's fourth-quarter 1992 operating deficit was about $8.2 
billion and its final deficit for the year went above $4.9 
billion while its costs related to restructuring rose to $11.6 
billion. 
  It effected staff cuts of 32,000 persons, equivalent to 
nearly 10 percent of its total work force. Its supplementary 
resignation costs covering extra resignation funds were $2.3 
billion and totalled $5.4 billion when the share due in the 
following fiscal year are included. Yet, its pension expenses 
were $838 million, growing by no more than just over $300 
million above the previous quarter. It is a big contrast to the 
dire distress which Japanese firms go through even in paying out 
ordinary resignation funds. 
<H5>  Great Difference Between Japan and the United States </H5>
  Where Japan differs greatly from the United States is not 
merely in the sense of obligations owed to employees and their 
security. For the size of liabilities a firm will carry forward 
into the future, its liabilities still to be accumulated for 
pensions and its expenses in a period are vital information for 
investors, but in Japan these are not adequately disclosed. 
  In the United States, not only are shortfalls in 
accumulations of pension assets added into the balance sheets, 
but such items as the market value of pension assets and pension 
expenses are also entered. In statements of cash-flow accounts, 
cash appropriated for pension funds is disclosed. In Japan, once 
an appropriation is made to a pension fund outside of the 
company, it becomes an off-the-book asset and only the book 
value of pension assets is disclosed. Pension expenses also are 
lumped together as legal welfare expenses and become unknown to 
anyone on the outside. 
  The Hitachi, Ltd.'s total of pension assets and resignation 
payment allocations as of the end of March 1993 was about 725 
billion yen. That differs greatly from the approximately 570 
billion yen at Toshiba, where the scale of staffing and average 
age are not very different. On the grounds that "We have no 
obligation to disclose it," expenses for the quarter are not 
revealed; however, cumulatively a gap in expenses of about 150 
billion yen would have existed in the past. 
<H5>  Era for Deferrals Is Passing </H5>
  The era is passing in which under the systems of lifetime 
employment and seniority wages premising a high growth rate 
firms could defer expenses, and the need is growing to set up 
conditions for corporate ratings that even allow global 
comparisons. The issue of "labor liabilities," while subsuming 
complex elements tied to the social system, is a topic that 
makes it urgently necessary to take up a clarification of the 
obligations and security measures that companies owe their 
employees as well as disclosure of information to 
investors.

    [Text]NTT Data Communications will establish June 1 a 
Multimedia 
Business Promotion Headquarters, a new company-wide strategy 
organization which will draft the basic concepts needed to drive 
the company's multimedia business forward. The new organization 
will handle multimedia related business planning, development, 
and implementation as well as information source management and 
allocation activities. Through these efforts NTT DATA hopes to 
offer a variety of new services which exploit multimedia 
technologies. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 1 Jun 94 p 2, Tokyo NIKKAN

  NEC has developed a 0.25-micron aluminum wiring technique, 
which it intends to use for 256Mbit DRAM production. The company 
has replaced photo resist used as a mask material with silicon 
oxide, which makes it possible to lay wires in circuits with 
slightly irregular surface. Photo resist needs to be 2 microns 
thick, but silicon oxide needs to be only 0.2 micron thick. 
Since silicon oxide is etched slower than conventional photo 
resist, it is more suited for use in designing finer circuit 
patterns. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 1 Jun 94 p 5) 
  Oki Electric will enter the thin-film transistor LCD driver 
IC market. The company, which manufactures 6 million units of 
super-twisted nematic and other LCD driver ICs per month, plans 
to start producing TFT LCD driver ICs at its Miyazaki plant in 
August, but does not intend to invest in new production 
equipment. The TFT LCD market is said to exceed 500 billion yen 
($4.81 bil) in 1996 or 1997, and targeting PC LCD makers Oki is 
aiming to boost TFT LCD driver IC output to over 1 million units 
per month within two to three years. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO

  The MPT Telecommunications Council has reported that the 
development of a nationwide optical communications network will 
cost 75-95 trillion yen ($721.15-913.46 bil), including 42 
trillion yen ($403.85 bil) estimated to cost to lay optical 
fiber cables underground. The council has submitted 
recommendations concerning network development to the Minister 
of Posts and Telecommunications. The report recommends that the 
network be built in three stages until 2010. The first-phase, 
which should be completed by 2000, will connect cities with 
prefectural government seats covering 20% of population; 
the 
second-phase, which should be finished by 2005, will expand the 
network to include cities with a population of over 100,000 
covering 60% of population; and the third-phase should be 
completed by 2010. The council estimates that the development of 
the network will result in the creation of a 123 trillion yen 
($1.18 tril) market and the generation of 2.43 million jobs in 
2010. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 1 Jun 94 p 1, Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO

  Tokyo Electron (TEL) will introduce in June an NTT-developed 
circuit design logic synthesis tool. The Parthenon Basic uses a 
high-level language developed by NTT and allows designers to 
develop electronic circuits like C programming. The workstation 
version of the basic package including a simulator and logic 
synthesis tool is priced at 720,000 yen ($6,923), with TEL 
aiming to sell 300 sets the first year. TEL will not just sell 
the package but also assist customers in developing ASICs based 
on the circuit designs created using the tool. (Tokyo NIKKAN

  Hitachi intends to nearly triple production of color 
super-twisted nematic LCDs this year. While thin-film transistor 
LCDs are attracting a great deal of attention in the LCD market, 
HITACHI has concluded that demand for STN LCDs will be growing 
stronger for use in low-cost PCs and portable data terminals. 
The company's Taiwanese subsidiary is scheduled to begin 
producing color STN LCDs this fiscal year. Together with a new 
TFT LCD line that will begin full-scale production in the second 
half of this year, Hitachi's annual LCD business in fiscal 1994 
is expected to reach 50 billion yen ($480.8 mil). (Tokyo NIHON

  Shibaura Seisakusho has developed and started marketing LCD 
glass substrate wet processing system. The HC Series is a 
single-substrate process system that can stably carry out 
cleaning and chemical processes. The system consists of process 
tools such as a scroll brush, high-flow-velocity flat nozzle, 
cavitation jet, and mechanical sonic shower. System prices start 
at 50 million yen ($480,769). The company projects fiscal 1994 
sales of 50 systems. (Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 1 Jun 94 p 9) 
  Mitsubishi Kasei has developed a technique for completely 
automating the entire optical disk production process. The 
company will construct an automated production system at its 
Mizushima plant in Okayama Prefecture and will install a 
fully-integrated automated line at the main North Carolina plant 
of Verbatim, which was acquired by Mitsubishi Kasei. The line 
will have the capacity to produce 200,000 disks per month and 
will begin full-scale operations next year. There are plans for 
a further fully-automated line in Europe. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 15) 
  NEC has developed an optical communications semiconductor 
laser using a material with low toxicity. Developed through 
metal organic chemical vapor deposition, the semiconductor laser 
uses liquid tertiary butyl amine (TBA) and tertiary butyl 
phosphine (TBP) as its materials. Since TBA and TBP are 
considerably less toxic than current gas materials, costs of 
assuring safety can be reduced considerably. The semiconductor 
achieves a threshold current of 9mA at 20 degrees C, an 
oscillation efficiency of 0.4W/A, and an output of 15mW at 100 
degrees C. The company plans to switch to new materials for 
manufacturing optical communications semiconductor lasers at its 
labs within the year. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 1, Tokyo

  Toshiba has developed a 2.7V amp IC for use in personal 
handy 
phone systems (PHSs). The IC, which consists of two MES FETs, 
has ions implanted in circuits where current runs in order to 
lower resistance and increase current. It requires 2.7V to 
operate; conventional ICs require 4V. It amplifies sound signal 
output to 180mW, enough to power the PHS. The company explains 
that since the IC's transistor electrodes use heat-resistant 
tungsten the IC is suited to be mass-produced. (Tokyo NIKKEI 
SANGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 5) 
  NEC has developed a technique for making 0.2-micron-wide 
electrodes using titanium silicide. Called the DIET method, the 
technique implants ions into a silicon monocrystal substrate to 
turn the surface into an amorphous surface and sputters with 
titanium. Then, the substrate goes through a thermal process at 
800-900 C to convert the amorphous state into crystal, and 
titanium not reacted on is removed. Since the new technique 
requires only one thermal process, resistance can be maintained 
at a low level. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 7) 
  MPT will set up an Internet Service Committee, a group 
devoted to promoting the commercialization of the Internet, the 
world's largest computer network. In addition to carriers such 
as NTT and KDD, committee members will include AT&amp;T Jens, 
Internet Initiative (IIJ), Fujitsu, and NEC. The new committee 
is the first organization of corporations committed to dealing 
with commercial Internet issues. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 2

  Eleven major electronics and data communications equipment 
manufacturers Including Hitachi, Fujitsu, and NEC will in July 
launch a Multimedia Promotion Council aimed at establishing 
industry-wide multimedia standards and lobbying for deregulation 
required to expand the multimedia market. The new group wants to 
prevent chaos in a market now characterized by multiple 
standards, and plans to call on users to participate in the 
organization as well. Other members include Toshiba, Mitsubishi 
Electric, Oki Electric, Matsushita Electric, Sony, Sharp, Sanyo 
Electric, and Matsushita Communication Industrial. (Tokyo NIKKEI 
SANGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 7) 
  Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a flash memory cell 
featuring a low threshold voltage error. The new cell is 
implemented using the thin-film transistor method instead of 
single-crystalline silicon. With conventional flash memory 
cells, 1,000 C dry oxidation is used to form tunnel oxide. 
Fujitsu instead used chemical vapor deposition to form 
10nm-thick tunnel oxide at 800 C. The use of CVD film has 
reduced the erase voltage error to 0.59V, down from 1.16V of 
conventional dry oxide films, meaning that this approach may 
help enhance the reliability of memory operation. The test 
device has a gate length of 2 microns, which the company claims 
can be reduced to 0.5 micron. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 
94 p 7) 
  Milliwave, a government/industry-funded R&amp;D company, and 
Fujitsu have jointly developed a milliwave receiver IC. The new 
IC down-converts milliwave (60GHz) signals to a frequency level 
that can be processed by existing devices, and also has an 
amplification capability. HEMTs (high electron mobility 
transistors) are created on a GaAs (gallium arsenide) substrate 
to implement all the necessary functions on chip. It consumes 
5mW and achieves a noise factor of 6.8dB. Milliwave was 
established by the Japan Key Technology Center, NEC, Fujitsu, 
and Obayashi Corp. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 7) 
  Mitsubishi Electric has developed a GaAs (gallium arsenide) 
FET for use in radio communications devices. Designed using a 
0.35-micron process, the GaAs FET achieves an output of 500mW at 
18GHz and a gain of 9.5dB. In order to lower the resistance of 
and improve the reliability of the FET's gate electrode, the 
electrode has two layers, tungsten silicide and gold layers. On 
a GaAs substrate, GaAs and silicon oxide layers are deposited. 
After 0.5-micron-wide circuit pattern is burned on the silicon 
oxide layer, etching is applied until the width of a recess, a 
trench, becomes 0.35 micron. Then, tungsten and gold is 
deposited to form a gate. Finally, unnecessary electrode 
residuals and silicon oxide are removed to form the T-shaped 
electrode whose large section is conducive to lowering 
resistance. Mitsubishi plans to begin sampling in August and 
volume production at its Kita-Itami plant within the year. The 
sample price will be set at 10,000 yen ($95.24). (Tokyo DEMPA

  NEC has developed a technique for forming 0.25-micron low- 
resistance aluminum interconnection, a technique deemed 
necessary for the manufacture of 1Gbit DRAMs. The wafer is 
exposed to organic titan gas (TDMAT) before going through an 
aluminum chemical vapor deposition process, which eliminates the 
need for an underlying film and reduce interconnection 
resistance. The technique can be used to create trenched 
aluminum wiring with an aspect ratio of over 5. (Tokyo DEMPA 
SHIMBUN 3 Jun 94 p 5) 
  NEC has developed a silicon-on-silicon (SOS) multi-chip 
module (MCM) technique which mounts multiple LSIs placed on a 
silicon substrate as a chip set. The technique reduces the 
circuit pitch of MCM substrates to 20 microns, 1/5 the length 
conventionally required of 100MHz or faster signal transmission. 
Therefore, compared to printed circuit boards and ceramic 
substrates, the SOS MCM requires 1/8 and 1/3, respectively, the 
surface mount area. Most SOS MCMs will be smaller than 20mm 
square, so they can be mounted on existing packages such as quad 
flat packs (QFPs). The company also claims that manufacturing 
costs will be kept about the same as PCBs. NEC is aiming to 
commercialize SOS MCMs two to three years from now. (Tokyo NIHON 
KOGYO SHIMBUN 3 Jun 94 p 7) 
  NTT has developed a friction force microscope (FFM) capable 
of observing the distribution of friction force on the surface 
of an object in the order of atoms. The FFM uses an atomic force 
microscope (AFM) to measure the precise distribution of friction 
force applied to a sample by scanning it with a probe, 
functioning as a sensor, contacting it on the surface of the 
sample. The FFM uses its photo diode to measure how the probe 
moves vertically and how it becomes twisted, and displays the 
measurements on a computer monitor. In an experiment, the 
company succeeded in observing a sample by pressuring its 
surface with a force of 30 nanonewtons, not strong enough to 
destroy atoms. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 5) 
  NEC has developed a silicon bipolar transistor prototype 
that 
operates at very low temperature at double the speed of the 
transistor operating at room temperature. The new technique is 
expected to pave the way for implementation of ultra-high-speed 
BiCMOS LSIs for use in supercomputers. The company has optimized 
concentration and distribution of impurities in the bipolar 
transistor's collector and base regions to improve its current 
amplification and cut-off frequency at low temperature. 
Conventional bipolar transistors suffer performance 
deterioration when operating at low temperature, a bottleneck 
for developing a viable BiCMOS LSI that can operate at low 
temperature. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 9) 
  Japan's government will in fiscal 1994 draft its first-ever 
five- year plan aimed at computerizing the nation's bureaucracy. 
The government will draft a basic plan covering overall 
methodology and plans for cooperation and coordination among 
different ministries, while each ministry will create its own 
action plan. A project committee spanning four ministries has 
been formed and is now at work. Among other things, the plan 
calls for the installation of one PC per ministry employee and 
conversion to an electronic paperless system for official 
documents by 1999. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Fujitsu will stop developing a GaAs (gallium arsenide) CPU 
for its VPP500 parallel supercomputer and instead use the 
next-generation 0.35-micron CMOS LSI for a new model due out in 
the second half of 1995. The VPP500 is the first parallel 
supercomputer powered by GaAs LSIs and has 355gigaFLOPS 
(floating point operations per second) capability. Fujitsu 
thinks that the use of less expensive CMOS LSIs will help lower 
the parallel supercomputer price to less than 1 billion yen 
($9.5 mil) while maintaining the current performance level. With 
the company's decision, its GaAs LSI production subsidiary 
Fujitsu Quantum Device will specialize in the manufacture of 
GaAs chips for communication equipment. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 1) 
  NEC has developed an inter-layer insulator formation 
technique for 256Mbit DRAM production. The new technique uses 
biased ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) CVD (chemical vapor 
deposition) to form silicon nitride oxide and helps reduce the 
number of process steps to 1/10 the current level. Insulators 
made using the newly-developed technique are not absorbent and 
are expected to contribute to higher device reliability. (Tokyo 
NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 6) 
  NEC has developed a technique for forming a 0.04-micron-deep 
PN junction, which has been deemed necessary for implementing 
0.1-micron-class CMOS LSIs. After forming oxide and polysilicon 
layers on a silicon substrate, boron ions are implanted into the 
substrate. The substrate then goes through a 1,000 C RTA (rapid 
thermal anneal) process to shallowly diffuse the boron ions in 
the substrate. The company has test-fabricated a 0.18-micron 
PMOS element using the so-called BDSOX technique and confirmed 
that the element is almost free from fluctuations in threshold 
voltage. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 4) 
  Hitachi has developed a CMOS gate array capable of 
integrating high-speed RAM. Models of the HG72E series can 
integrate up to 288Kbits of embedded RAM: 4Kbit and 64Kbit RAMs 
have cycle times of 4.5ns and 6.2ns, respectively. The new 3.3V 
gate array is suitable for use in video memory and cache memory 
applications. The company will start taking design orders in 
September in Japan and the U.S. An 18,000-gate model with 
64Kbits of RAM supplied in a 160-pin package is priced at 5,000 
yen ($47.62) apiece in lots of 10,000. Hitachi plans to increase 
production to 100,000 units a month by June 1995. (Tokyo NIKKAN

  NTT will completely overhaul its satellite communications 
service. It will abolish its current rule of dedicating each 
transponder to one channel, and switch over to a system whereby 
a single transponder can be devoted to multiple channels for 
different customers. It will also permit use of ground stations 
and other earth equipment not procured by NTT. After working out 
the details of the service, NTT will apply to MPT as early as 
this year for approval for the changes. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Fujitsu has developed a 64Mbit synchronous DRAM and will 
begin shipping samples in August. Designed using 0.35 
double-metal CMOS processes, 140 million elements are integrated 
on a 232-sq.-millimeter chip, about the same size as a 64Mbit 
DRAM chip. The synchronous DRAM, which comes in two types, the 
MB81164440 configured 16Mword x 4bit x 4bank and the MB81164840 
configured 8Mword x 8bit x 4bank, has a three-step pipeline 
structure and operates at a clock speed of 100MHz on 3.3V. The 
chip also uses the company's proprietary interface, Terminated 
LVTTL, for data transfer between memory and a CPU. The 8bit 
model achieves a data transfer rate of 100Mbyte/s, the 
equivalent of sending 260 newspaper pages in 1/12 of a second, 
and an access time of 6ns. Sample prices will be set at 
150,000-200,000 yen ($1,429-1,905). The chip maker's Mie plant 
will initially produce 64Mbit synchronous DRAMs, but Fujitsu 
will install 8-inch wafer processing equipment for volume 
production at its Iwate plant to begin production at 1 million 
units per month three years from now. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 8 Jun

  KDD has developed an OSI (open systems interconnection) 
communications hybrid IC. The OSI Engine integrates a 16bit CPU, 
64Kbyte RAM, communications control LSI, gate array, and other 
circuits on a 3x2.5cm silicon substrate. The use of the hybrid 
IC reduces the number of components needed for an OSI 
communications board to about 10, 1/5 the number required of 
conventional boards, and considerably cuts costs. The new IC 
takes 1/4 the space on board and enables third parties to 
develop card adapters for handheld information devices. KDD is 
considering selling a low-priced PC communications board using 
the OSI engine through subsidiaries and supplying the IC to 
system makers. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Jun 94 p 1) 
  NEC has developed an LSI circuit which enables operations on 
1.2V at 1GHz, 10 times faster than conventional circuits. The 
MOS current mode logic, which integrates MOS and bipolar 
transistor techniques, has the same structure as MOS transistors 
and yet is capable of regulating current and provides both 
economy and performance. The circuit also uses an adaptive 
pipeline control circuit to reduce power consumption to 1/5 the 
level of CMOS circuits. The use of the new circuit will enable 
portable phones and battery-operated devices to improve 
performance and extend battery lifespan. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 8

  NEC has developed a technique for removing particles from 
wafers using ionized alkaline water. The technique is 
particularly effective in removing particles that are generated 
a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In an experiment, 
the company confirmed that the new technique reduced the number 
of particles on wafer from over 20,000 just after the CMP 
process to less than 100. Ionized alkaline water can reduce the 
amount of particles to 1/5 the level achieved by alkaline 
chemical with comparable pH. Once the new technique is put into 
practical use, cleaning chemical neutralization processes will 
significantly be simplified and production costs will be 
reduced. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 8 Jun 94 p 9) 
  MPT plans to reexamine Japan's current telecommunications 
sector dichotomy whereby NTT handles domestic operations 
exclusively while KDD provides only international services. The 
ministry is getting ready to review NTT's overall business, 
including further divestiture slated for fiscal 1995, and a 
reconsideration of the long-standing dichotomy will be part of 
this effort. International communications operations were split 
off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation to 
form KDD in 1953, and Japan's unusual telecommunications 
industry dichotomy, unique among leading industrial nations, has 
remained in place ever since. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 8 Jun 94 p 2) 
  Tokin has developed the industry's smallest optical isolator 
for use in 0.98-micron communications systems. The 4mm-diameter 
isolator uses CdMnHgTe (cadmium manganese mercury telluride) 
crystal and features lower noise than that of a 1.48-micron 
optical isolator which is used as a substitute for a 0.98-micron 
isolator, halving the power consumption of an excitation light 
source. The new isolator helps reduce the optical amplifier 
size. The company will start producing it in October, aiming for 
sales of 10 billion yen ($96.2 mil) in fiscal 1996. (Tokyo 
NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 9 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a ferroelectric memory 
transistor based on a metal oxide substrate made of strontium 
titanate. Although metal oxide is usually an insulator, the new 
material to which impurities are doped behaves as a 
semiconductor. With conventional ferroelectric memory 
transistors based on a silicon substrate, oxygen atoms contained 
in the ferroelectric layer are diffused in the substrate and 
adversely affect semiconductor characteristics, making 
development of high- density devices difficult. Since the 
strontium titanate is also an oxide, this problem can be 
avoided. The new substrate is optically transparent and 
therefore will help develop brighter LCDs if it is used for LCD 
thin-film transistors. The company will announce the results at 
the International Device Research Conference to be held at the 
University of Colorado beginning June 20. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO 
SHIMBUN 9 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Mitsubishi Electric has developed a technique for regulating 
ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) switch efficiently. The 
technique requires less than 1/10 the amount of memory needed by 
conventional ICs to regulate data traffic. The company has 
developed a 2x6mm prototype controller chip designed using a 
0.5-micron CMOS process incorporating the technique. With 
link-ups to 16 lines, the chip is capable of processing data at 
622Mbit/s, the equivalent of 150,000 lines. The company is 
aiming to develop a commercial version of the chip one year from 
now. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 10 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Mitsubishi Electric has developed two next-generation DRAM 
processing techniques. One of them is intended for 256Mbit DRAM 
production and is to form a capacitor which is made of BST 
(barium strontium titanate) films with a dielectric constant of 
350 and uses a platinum-made electrode. Since the high 
dielectric constant is conducive to storing more charges per 
area, capacitors can be made into smaller flat sheets, 
simplifying a cell structure. Capacitors usually use nitride 
films with a dielectric constant of 7.4, requiring 
three-dimensional structure to secure enough capacity. The new 
technique can cut capacitor formation processes by half compared 
to conventional processes and guarantee a yield of more than 
90%. The other technique which MITSUBISHI plans to use for 
1Gbit DRAM production develops a vertical transistor shaped like 
a Greek character, phi. The technique places a capacitor 
directly on a transistor and builds a bit line into an SOI 
(silicon on insulator) substrate. The company claims that the 
transistor helps reduce memory chip size by 35-48%, the 
number 
of processes by 15-31%, and production costs by 
45-64% 
compared to conventionally available approaches. (Tokyo DEMPA

  Hitachi has developed a technique for reducing LSI data 
transfer bus power consumption. The "charge distribution" method 
features an additional signal line to a set of signal lines used 
to transfer information. The additional line helps reduce the 
amount of charges that must be removed to turn the signal level 
from high to low. The company fabricated a 16bit- wide test 
device using 0.5-micron technology and confirmed the device 
consumed just 1.4mW in data transfer mode at a clock cycle of 
40MHz, down from conventional 11mW. The technique is expected to 
help reduce entire LSI power consumption by 20%. (Tokyo

  [Text] Washington, 13 Jun -- Concerning the DPRK's 
announcement on 13 June of its withdrawal from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN diplomatic source indicated: 
"The act is in line with a carefully-worked out plan for phased 
steps to deal with moves of the United States and Europe." The 
DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its 
official secession from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT). Pyongyang's decision to pull out of the IAEA is 
considered an act aimed at upgrading its diplomatic cards by 
showing the United States and the United Nations its readiness 
"to withdraw from the NPT anytime." 
  The purpose of participating in the IAEA is to promote 
exchanges, and to study knowhow and technology for the peaceful 
use of nuclear power -- which is a different purpose from 
joining the NPT. Also, according to the rules, the DPRK's 
withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its 
departure from the NPT. 
  In a government statement, North Korea referred to its 
"special position" (of holding up a decision to withdraw from 
the NPT). It is necessary for Pyongyang to maintain this 
special position to continue to reject demands to accept nuclear 
inspections in accordance with safeguard arrangements, while 
remaining in the NPT.

  [Text] New York, June 14 KYODO -- The United States on 
Tuesday [14 June] appeared ready to submit a graduated sanctions 
resolution to the UN Security Council over North Korea's 
continued rejection of demands for inspections of its nuclear 
facilities, UN diplomatic sources said. 
  The sources said the initial phase of sanctions will include 
a freeze of UN Development aid for North Korea's free economic 
and trade zone project in the Tumen river basin along with a 
halt on economic, scientific and cultural assistance. If North 
Korea continues to refuse to cooperate with the inspections 
required under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), a 
second phase of sanctions would be imposed. These would include 
an embargo on military exports to Pyongyang, a freeze on North 
Korean foreign assets, and a ban on the flow of hard currency 
into North Korea from overseas, the sources said. A third phase 
of sanctions would include a comprehensive trade embargo and 
travel ban on North Korea, the sources suggested. 
  Meanwhile, South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported North 
Korea's envoy to the United Nations Pak Kil-yon has warned that 
North Korea will leave the NPT if sanctions are imposed on 
Pyongyang. North Korea threatened to pull out of the NPT in 
March 1993 over demands that it grant inspectors access to two 
undeclared nuclear sites. It later suspended its withdrawal 
decision after high-level walks with the U.S. Pak met with 
representatives of the 10 nonpermanent members of the Security 
Council on Tuesday and informed them that North Korea has 
formally notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
of its decision to withdraw from the monitoring agency. Pak 
also acknowledged that two IAEA inspectors are still in North 
Korea. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday confirmed that it 
has received North Korea's notification that it was pulling out 
of the agency. 
  YONHAP, quoting Pak, reported Pyongyang will not allow any 
further IAEA inspections since it has withdrawn from the agency, 
although the nuclear checks are still required under the NPT. 
Pak said a resolution to the nuclear stalemate depends on the 
U.S., insisting that Washington should change its attitude and 
return to negotiations, according to YONHAP. 
  UN Spokesman Joe Sills said North Korea is still subject to 
inspection provisions of the NPT despite its withdrawal from the 
IAEA. According to Sills, North Korea is the third nation to 
have left the IAEA, following Honduras and Nicaragua. Nicaragua 
later rejoined the IAEA. There are 164 signatory nations to the 
NPT, and 121 members in the IAEA, Sills said. 
  U.S. Government officials said the two IAEA inspectors in 
North Korea were continuing with their activities of monitoring 
and adjusting IAEA observation equipment at North Korean nuclear 
facilities. The officials said that it is essential that the 
inspectors carry out their activities beyond just being in North 
Korea. They reiterated their concern that the situation could 
become worse if the inspectors are asked to leave.

    NTT Data Communications will establish June 1 a Multimedia 
Business Promotion Headquarters, a new company-wide strategy 
organization which will draft the basic concepts needed to drive 
the company's multimedia business forward. The new organization 
will handle multimedia related business planning, development, 
and implementation as well as information source management and 
allocation activities. Through these efforts NTT DATA hopes to 
offer a variety of new services which exploit multimedia 
technologies. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 1 Jun 94 p 2, Tokyo NIKKAN

  NEC has developed a 0.25-micron aluminum wiring technique, 
which it intends to use for 256Mbit DRAM production. The company 
has replaced photo resist used as a mask material with silicon 
oxide, which makes it possible to lay wires in circuits with 
slightly irregular surface. Photo resist needs to be 2 microns 
thick, but silicon oxide needs to be only 0.2 micron thick. 
Since silicon oxide is etched slower than conventional photo 
resist, it is more suited for use in designing finer circuit 
patterns. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 1 Jun 94 p 5) 
  Oki Electric will enter the thin-film transistor LCD driver 
IC market. The company, which manufactures 6 million units of 
super-twisted nematic and other LCD driver ICs per month, plans 
to start producing TFT LCD driver ICs at its Miyazaki plant in 
August, but does not intend to invest in new production 
equipment. The TFT LCD market is said to exceed 500 billion yen 
($4.81 bil) in 1996 or 1997, and targeting PC LCD makers Oki is 
aiming to boost TFT LCD driver IC output to over 1 million units 
per month within two to three years. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO

  The MPT Telecommunications Council has reported that the 
development of a nationwide optical communications network will 
cost 75-95 trillion yen ($721.15-913.46 bil), including 42 
trillion yen ($403.85 bil) estimated to cost to lay optical 
fiber cables underground. The council has submitted 
recommendations concerning network development to the Minister 
of Posts and Telecommunications. The report recommends that the 
network be built in three stages until 2010. The first-phase, 
which should be completed by 2000, will connect cities with 
prefectural government seats covering 20% of population; 
the 
second-phase, which should be finished by 2005, will expand the 
network to include cities with a population of over 100,000 
covering 60% of population; and the third-phase should be 
completed by 2010. The council estimates that the development of 
the network will result in the creation of a 123 trillion yen 
($1.18 tril) market and the generation of 2.43 million jobs in 
2010. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 1 Jun 94 p 1, Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO

  Tokyo Electron (TEL) will introduce in June an NTT-developed 
circuit design logic synthesis tool. The Parthenon Basic uses a 
high-level language developed by NTT and allows designers to 
develop electronic circuits like C programming. The workstation 
version of the basic package including a simulator and logic 
synthesis tool is priced at 720,000 yen ($6,923), with TEL 
aiming to sell 300 sets the first year. TEL will not just sell 
the package but also assist customers in developing ASICs based 
on the circuit designs created using the tool. (Tokyo NIKKAN

  Hitachi intends to nearly triple production of color 
super-twisted nematic LCDs this year. While thin-film transistor 
LCDs are attracting a great deal of attention in the LCD market, 
HITACHI has concluded that demand for STN LCDs will be growing 
stronger for use in low-cost PCs and portable data terminals. 
The company's Taiwanese subsidiary is scheduled to begin 
producing color STN LCDs this fiscal year. Together with a new 
TFT LCD line that will begin full-scale production in the second 
half of this year, Hitachi's annual LCD business in fiscal 1994 
is expected to reach 50 billion yen ($480.8 mil). (Tokyo NIHON

  Shibaura Seisakusho has developed and started marketing LCD 
glass substrate wet processing system. The HC Series is a 
single-substrate process system that can stably carry out 
cleaning and chemical processes. The system consists of process 
tools such as a scroll brush, high-flow-velocity flat nozzle, 
cavitation jet, and mechanical sonic shower. System prices start 
at 50 million yen ($480,769). The company projects fiscal 1994 
sales of 50 systems. (Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 1 Jun 94 p 9) 
  Mitsubishi Kasei has developed a technique for completely 
automating the entire optical disk production process. The 
company will construct an automated production system at its 
Mizushima plant in Okayama Prefecture and will install a 
fully-integrated automated line at the main North Carolina plant 
of Verbatim, which was acquired by Mitsubishi Kasei. The line 
will have the capacity to produce 200,000 disks per month and 
will begin full-scale operations next year. There are plans for 
a further fully-automated line in Europe. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO

  NEC has developed an optical communications semiconductor 
laser using a material with low toxicity. Developed through 
metal organic chemical vapor deposition, the semiconductor laser 
uses liquid tertiary butyl amine (TBA) and tertiary butyl 
phosphine (TBP) as its materials. Since TBA and TBP are 
considerably less toxic than current gas materials, costs of 
assuring safety can be reduced considerably. The semiconductor 
achieves a threshold current of 9mA at 20 degrees C, an 
oscillation efficiency of 0.4W/A, and an output of 15mW at 100 
degrees C. The company plans to switch to new materials for 
manufacturing optical communications semiconductor lasers at its 
labs within the year. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 1, Tokyo

  Toshiba has developed a 2.7V amp IC for use in personal 
handy 
phone systems (PHSs). The IC, which consists of two MES FETs, 
has ions implanted in circuits where current runs in order to 
lower resistance and increase current. It requires 2.7V to 
operate; conventional ICs require 4V. It amplifies sound signal 
output to 180mW, enough to power the PHS. The company explains 
that since the IC's transistor electrodes use heat-resistant 
tungsten the IC is suited to be mass-produced. (Tokyo NIKKEI 
SANGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 5) 
  NEC has developed a technique for making 0.2-micron-wide 
electrodes using titanium silicide. Called the DIET method, the 
technique implants ions into a silicon monocrystal substrate to 
turn the surface into an amorphous surface and sputters with 
titanium. Then, the substrate goes through a thermal process at 
800-900 C to convert the amorphous state into crystal, and 
titanium not reacted on is removed. Since the new technique 
requires only one thermal process, resistance can be maintained 
at a low level. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 7) 
  MPT will set up an Internet Service Committee, a group 
devoted to promoting the commercialization of the Internet, the 
world's largest computer network. In addition to carriers such 
as NTT and KDD, committee members will include AT&amp;T Jens, 
Internet Initiative (IIJ), Fujitsu, and NEC. The new committee 
is the first organization of corporations committed to dealing 
with commercial Internet issues. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 2

  Eleven major electronics and data communications equipment 
manufacturers Including Hitachi, Fujitsu, and NEC will in July 
launch a Multimedia Promotion Council aimed at establishing 
industry-wide multimedia standards and lobbying for deregulation 
required to expand the multimedia market. The new group wants to 
prevent chaos in a market now characterized by multiple 
standards, and plans to call on users to participate in the 
organization as well. Other members include Toshiba, Mitsubishi 
Electric, Oki Electric, Matsushita Electric, Sony, Sharp, Sanyo 
Electric, and Matsushita Communication Industrial. (Tokyo NIKKEI

  Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a flash memory cell 
featuring a low threshold voltage error. The new cell is 
implemented using the thin-film transistor method instead of 
single-crystalline silicon. With conventional flash memory 
cells, 1,000 C dry oxidation is used to form tunnel oxide. 
Fujitsu instead used chemical vapor deposition to form 
10nm-thick tunnel oxide at 800 C. The use of CVD film has 
reduced the erase voltage error to 0.59V, down from 1.16V of 
conventional dry oxide films, meaning that this approach may 
help enhance the reliability of memory operation. The test 
device has a gate length of 2 microns, which the company claims 
can be reduced to 0.5 micron. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 
94 p 7) 
  Milliwave, a government/industry-funded R&amp;D company, and 
Fujitsu have jointly developed a milliwave receiver IC. The new 
IC down-converts milliwave (60GHz) signals to a frequency level 
that can be processed by existing devices, and also has an 
amplification capability. HEMTs (high electron mobility 
transistors) are created on a GaAs (gallium arsenide) substrate 
to implement all the necessary functions on chip. It consumes 
5mW and achieves a noise factor of 6.8dB. Milliwave was 
established by the Japan Key Technology Center, NEC, Fujitsu, 
and Obayashi Corp. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 2 Jun 94 p 7) 
  Mitsubishi Electric has developed a GaAs (gallium arsenide) 
FET for use in radio communications devices. Designed using a 
0.35-micron process, the GaAs FET achieves an output of 500mW at 
18GHz and a gain of 9.5dB. In order to lower the resistance of 
and improve the reliability of the FET's gate electrode, the 
electrode has two layers, tungsten silicide and gold layers. On 
a GaAs substrate, GaAs and silicon oxide layers are deposited. 
After 0.5-micron-wide circuit pattern is burned on the silicon 
oxide layer, etching is applied until the width of a recess, a 
trench, becomes 0.35 micron. Then, tungsten and gold is 
deposited to form a gate. Finally, unnecessary electrode 
residuals and silicon oxide are removed to form the T-shaped 
electrode whose large section is conducive to lowering 
resistance. Mitsubishi plans to begin sampling in August and 
volume production at its Kita-Itami plant within the year. The 
sample price will be set at 10,000 yen ($95.24). (Tokyo DEMPA

  NEC has developed a technique for forming 0.25-micron low- 
resistance aluminum interconnection, a technique deemed 
necessary for the manufacture of 1Gbit DRAMs. The wafer is 
exposed to organic titan gas (TDMAT) before going through an 
aluminum chemical vapor deposition process, which eliminates the 
need for an underlying film and reduce interconnection 
resistance. The technique can be used to create trenched 
aluminum wiring with an aspect ratio of over 5. (Tokyo DEMPA 
SHIMBUN 3 Jun 94 p 5) 
  NEC has developed a silicon-on-silicon (SOS) multi-chip 
module (MCM) technique which mounts multiple LSIs placed on a 
silicon substrate as a chip set. The technique reduces the 
circuit pitch of MCM substrates to 20 microns, 1/5 the length 
conventionally required of 100MHz or faster signal transmission. 
Therefore, compared to printed circuit boards and ceramic 
substrates, the SOS MCM requires 1/8 and 1/3, respectively, the 
surface mount area. Most SOS MCMs will be smaller than 20mm 
square, so they can be mounted on existing packages such as quad 
flat packs (QFPs). The company also claims that manufacturing 
costs will be kept about the same as PCBs. NEC is aiming to 
commercialize SOS MCMs two to three years from now. (Tokyo NIHON 
KOGYO SHIMBUN 3 Jun 94 p 7) 
  NTT has developed a friction force microscope (FFM) capable 
of observing the distribution of friction force on the surface 
of an object in the order of atoms. The FFM uses an atomic force 
microscope (AFM) to measure the precise distribution of friction 
force applied to a sample by scanning it with a probe, 
functioning as a sensor, contacting it on the surface of the 
sample. The FFM uses its photo diode to measure how the probe 
moves vertically and how it becomes twisted, and displays the 
measurements on a computer monitor. In an experiment, the 
company succeeded in observing a sample by pressuring its 
surface with a force of 30 nanonewtons, not strong enough to 
destroy atoms. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 5) 
  NEC has developed a silicon bipolar transistor prototype 
that 
operates at very low temperature at double the speed of the 
transistor operating at room temperature. The new technique is 
expected to pave the way for implementation of ultra-high-speed 
BiCMOS LSIs for use in supercomputers. The company has optimized 
concentration and distribution of impurities in the bipolar 
transistor's collector and base regions to improve its current 
amplification and cut-off frequency at low temperature. 
Conventional bipolar transistors suffer performance 
deterioration when operating at low temperature, a bottleneck 
for developing a viable BiCMOS LSI that can operate at low 
temperature. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 9) 
  Japan's government will in fiscal 1994 draft its first-ever 
five- year plan aimed at computerizing the nation's bureaucracy. 
The government will draft a basic plan covering overall 
methodology and plans for cooperation and coordination among 
different ministries, while each ministry will create its own 
action plan. A project committee spanning four ministries has 
been formed and is now at work. Among other things, the plan 
calls for the installation of one PC per ministry employee and 
conversion to an electronic paperless system for official 
documents by 1999. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Fujitsu will stop developing a GaAs (gallium arsenide) CPU 
for its VPP500 parallel supercomputer and instead use the 
next-generation 0.35-micron CMOS LSI for a new model due out in 
the second half of 1995. The VPP500 is the first parallel 
supercomputer powered by GaAs LSIs and has 355gigaFLOPS 
(floating point operations per second) capability. Fujitsu 
thinks that the use of less expensive CMOS LSIs will help lower 
the parallel supercomputer price to less than 1 billion yen 
($9.5 mil) while maintaining the current performance level. With 
the company's decision, its GaAs LSI production subsidiary 
Fujitsu Quantum Device will specialize in the manufacture of 
GaAs chips for communication equipment. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 6 Jun 94 p 1) 
  NEC has developed an inter-layer insulator formation 
technique for 256Mbit DRAM production. The new technique uses 
biased ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) CVD (chemical vapor 
deposition) to form silicon nitride oxide and helps reduce the 
number of process steps to 1/10 the current level. Insulators 
made using the newly-developed technique are not absorbent and 
are expected to contribute to higher device reliability. (Tokyo 
NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 6) 
  NEC has developed a technique for forming a 0.04-micron-deep 
PN junction, which has been deemed necessary for implementing 
0.1-micron-class CMOS LSIs. After forming oxide and polysilicon 
layers on a silicon substrate, boron ions are implanted into the 
substrate. The substrate then goes through a 1,000 C RTA (rapid 
thermal anneal) process to shallowly diffuse the boron ions in 
the substrate. The company has test-fabricated a 0.18-micron 
PMOS element using the so-called BDSOX technique and confirmed 
that the element is almost free from fluctuations in threshold 
voltage. (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 4) 
  Hitachi has developed a CMOS gate array capable of 
integrating high-speed RAM. Models of the HG72E series can 
integrate up to 288Kbits of embedded RAM: 4Kbit and 64Kbit RAMs 
have cycle times of 4.5ns and 6.2ns, respectively. The new 3.3V 
gate array is suitable for use in video memory and cache memory 
applications. The company will start taking design orders in 
September in Japan and the U.S. An 18,000-gate model with 
64Kbits of RAM supplied in a 160-pin package is priced at 5,000 
yen ($47.62) apiece in lots of 10,000. Hitachi plans to increase 
production to 100,000 units a month by June 1995. (Tokyo NIKKAN 
KOGYO SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 7) 
  NTT will completely overhaul its satellite communications 
service. It will abolish its current rule of dedicating each 
transponder to one channel, and switch over to a system whereby 
a single transponder can be devoted to multiple channels for 
different customers. It will also permit use of ground stations 
and other earth equipment not procured by NTT. After working out 
the details of the service, NTT will apply to MPT as early as 
this year for approval for the changes. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO 
SHIMBUN 7 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Fujitsu has developed a 64Mbit synchronous DRAM and will 
begin shipping samples in August. Designed using 0.35 
double-metal CMOS processes, 140 million elements are integrated 
on a 232-sq.-millimeter chip, about the same size as a 64Mbit 
DRAM chip. The synchronous DRAM, which comes in two types, the 
MB81164440 configured 16Mword x 4bit x 4bank and the MB81164840 
configured 8Mword x 8bit x 4bank, has a three-step pipeline 
structure and operates at a clock speed of 100MHz on 3.3V. The 
chip also uses the company's proprietary interface, Terminated 
LVTTL, for data transfer between memory and a CPU. The 8bit 
model achieves a data transfer rate of 100Mbyte/s, the 
equivalent of sending 260 newspaper pages in 1/12 of a second, 
and an access time of 6ns. Sample prices will be set at 
150,000-200,000 yen ($1,429-1,905). The chip maker's Mie plant 
will initially produce 64Mbit synchronous DRAMs, but Fujitsu 
will install 8-inch wafer processing equipment for volume 
production at its Iwate plant to begin production at 1 million 
units per month three years from now. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 8 Jun

  KDD has developed an OSI (open systems interconnection) 
communications hybrid IC. The OSI Engine integrates a 16bit CPU, 
64Kbyte RAM, communications control LSI, gate array, and other 
circuits on a 3x2.5cm silicon substrate. The use of the hybrid 
IC reduces the number of components needed for an OSI 
communications board to about 10, 1/5 the number required of 
conventional boards, and considerably cuts costs. The new IC 
takes 1/4 the space on board and enables third parties to 
develop card adapters for handheld information devices. KDD is 
considering selling a low-priced PC communications board using 
the OSI engine through subsidiaries and supplying the IC to 
system makers. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Jun 94 p 1) 
  NEC has developed an LSI circuit which enables operations on 
1.2V at 1GHz, 10 times faster than conventional circuits. The 
MOS current mode logic, which integrates MOS and bipolar 
transistor techniques, has the same structure as MOS transistors 
and yet is capable of regulating current and provides both 
economy and performance. The circuit also uses an adaptive 
pipeline control circuit to reduce power consumption to 1/5 the 
level of CMOS circuits. The use of the new circuit will enable 
portable phones and battery-operated devices to improve 
performance and extend battery lifespan. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 8

p 5, Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 8 Jun 94 p 9) 
  NEC has developed a technique for removing particles from 
wafers using ionized alkaline water. The technique is 
particularly effective in removing particles that are generated 
a chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In an experiment, 
the company confirmed that the new technique reduced the number 
of particles on wafer from over 20,000 just after the CMP 
process to less than 100. Ionized alkaline water can reduce the 
amount of particles to 1/5 the level achieved by alkaline 
chemical with comparable pH. Once the new technique is put into 
practical use, cleaning chemical neutralization processes will 
significantly be simplified and production costs will be 
reduced. (Tokyo NIHON KOGYO SHIMBUN 8 Jun 94 p 9) 
  MPT plans to reexamine Japan's current telecommunications 
sector dichotomy whereby NTT handles domestic operations 
exclusively while KDD provides only international services. The 
ministry is getting ready to review NTT's overall business, 
including further divestiture slated for fiscal 1995, and a 
reconsideration of the long-standing dichotomy will be part of 
this effort. International communications operations were split 
off from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation to 
form KDD in 1953, and Japan's unusual telecommunications 
industry dichotomy, unique among leading industrial nations, has 
remained in place ever since. (Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN 8 Jun 94 p 2) 
  Tokin has developed the industry's smallest optical isolator 
for use in 0.98-micron communications systems. The 4mm-diameter 
isolator uses CdMnHgTe (cadmium manganese mercury telluride) 
crystal and features lower noise than that of a 1.48-micron 
optical isolator which is used as a substitute for a 0.98-micron 
isolator, halving the power consumption of an excitation light 
source. The new isolator helps reduce the optical amplifier 
size. The company will start producing it in October, aiming for 
sales of 10 billion yen ($96.2 mil) in fiscal 1996. (Tokyo 
NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 9 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a ferroelectric memory 
transistor based on a metal oxide substrate made of strontium 
titanate. Although metal oxide is usually an insulator, the new 
material to which impurities are doped behaves as a 
semiconductor. With conventional ferroelectric memory 
transistors based on a silicon substrate, oxygen atoms contained 
in the ferroelectric layer are diffused in the substrate and 
adversely affect semiconductor characteristics, making 
development of high- density devices difficult. Since the 
strontium titanate is also an oxide, this problem can be 
avoided. The new substrate is optically transparent and 
therefore will help develop brighter LCDs if it is used for LCD 
thin-film transistors. The company will announce the results at 
the International Device Research Conference to be held at the 
University of Colorado beginning June 20. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO 
SHIMBUN 9 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Mitsubishi Electric has developed a technique for regulating 
ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) switch efficiently. The 
technique requires less than 1/10 the amount of memory needed by 
conventional ICs to regulate data traffic. The company has 
developed a 2x6mm prototype controller chip designed using a 
0.5-micron CMOS process incorporating the technique. With 
link-ups to 16 lines, the chip is capable of processing data at 
622Mbit/s, the equivalent of 150,000 lines. The company is 
aiming to develop a commercial version of the chip one year from 
now. (Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 10 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Mitsubishi Electric has developed two next-generation DRAM 
processing techniques. One of them is intended for 256Mbit DRAM 
production and is to form a capacitor which is made of BST 
(barium strontium titanate) films with a dielectric constant of 
350 and uses a platinum-made electrode. Since the high 
dielectric constant is conducive to storing more charges per 
area, capacitors can be made into smaller flat sheets, 
simplifying a cell structure. Capacitors usually use nitride 
films with a dielectric constant of 7.4, requiring 
three-dimensional structure to secure enough capacity. The new 
technique can cut capacitor formation processes by half compared 
to conventional processes and guarantee a yield of more than 
90%. The other technique which MITSUBISHI plans to use for 
1Gbit DRAM production develops a vertical transistor shaped like 
a Greek character, phi. The technique places a capacitor 
directly on a transistor and builds a bit line into an SOI 
(silicon on insulator) substrate. The company claims that the 
transistor helps reduce memory chip size by 35-48%, the 
number 
of processes by 15-31%, and production costs by 
45-64% 
compared to conventionally available approaches. (Tokyo DEMPA

SHIMBUN 10 Jun 94 p 5, Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO SHIMBUN 10 Jun 94 p 9) 
  Hitachi has developed a technique for reducing LSI data 
transfer bus power consumption. The "charge distribution" method 
features an additional signal line to a set of signal lines used 
to transfer information. The additional line helps reduce the 
amount of charges that must be removed to turn the signal level 
from high to low. The company fabricated a 16bit- wide test 
device using 0.5-micron technology and confirmed the device 
consumed just 1.4mW in data transfer mode at a clock cycle of 
40MHz, down from conventional 11mW. The technique is expected to 
help reduce entire LSI power consumption by 20%. (Tokyo

  [Text] The meeting of the commission on the roundtable for 
national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia was held 
energetically at Damnak Chan Pavilion in the Royal Palace. 
  His Excellency [H.E.] Ung Teaseam, under secretary of state 
for information, told national and international correspondents 
at the end of this first meeting that the participants discussed 
the first issue, that is, a cease-fire. Regarding this issue, 
the representatives of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] 
and National Assembly followed His Majesty's idea. To speed up 
a concrete schedule for the cease-fire, the RGC representatives 
proposed a starting date of 30 June or earlier. 
  Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge [KR] side proposed that a control 
committee be set up and still refused to accept the proposed 
schedule. 
  The roundtable meeting adjourned at 1200 and will resume 
work 
tomorrow morning at 0900.

  [Text] On 15 June, His Excellency [H.E.] Keo Put-reaksmei 
sent a brief report on the result of the 15 June roundtable to 
His Majesty the King. Here is an excerpt of this report: 
  This morning's discussion merely turned round and round on 
the first topic, that is, the cease-fire, and could not move on 
to the second topic despite the efforts of the party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]. 
  1. The cease-fire: 
  The PDK announced this morning in a statement that it had 
already replied to His Majesty's request for a yes or no answer, 
that is, it was most delighted to have a cease-fire. After 
that, this party proposed the setting up of a committee to 
discuss how the cease-fire should be observed so that it would 
not be just a simple cease-fire. This party stressed further 
that a cease-fire date could not be specified without prior 
discussion on this matter. 
  The Royal Government [RG]'s side, through H.E. Yu Hokkri, 
proposed 30 June 1994, beginning at noon, as the start of the 
cease- fire and proposed that there should be just an 
inter-Cambodian committee without any foreigners to control the 
cease-fire. 
  2. The minimal policy program: 
  The RG party avoided discussing this matter, claiming that 
the king's 12 June message did not require the roundtable to 
discuss this matter before the first topic in the agenda, that 
is, the cease-fire. 
  On its part, the PDK proposed that this minimal policy 
program be discussed as well, claiming that the two topics have 
[words indistinct] value and that it had already given the 
answer concerning the first topic through this morning's 
statement. This party insisted that the cease-fire [words 
indistinct] national reconciliation. 
  The two sides mutually understood the strong and weak points 
of each other's strategies and hoped that the roundtable would 
be able to reach a common point of view beneficial to the 
Cambodian nation and people. 
  The meeting ended at 1200 in a good atmosphere and will 
resume on the morning of 16 June.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 16 (AFP) -- A fresh attempt to 
negotiate an end to Cambodia's civil war ran into the sands 
Thursday, as talks between the government and the radical Khmer 
Rouge made no headway on even fundamental issues, officials said. 
  "There was no positive result from the meeting," the 
undersecretary of information, Ing Teasean, said after the 
second fruitless day of talks. 
  The meeting was the second round in the bid to end the Khmer 
Rouge's guerrilla conflict, which has sapped the government that 
emerged from UN-sponsored elections last year. 
  Ing Teasean said the Khmer Rouge "still don't accept a 
proposal for a ceasefire date" set for June 30 by King Norodom 
Sihanouk. "They are still being evasive." 
  The Khmer Rouge spokesman, Mak Ben, retorted: "We want a 
true ceasefire. We shall avoid a ceasefire which cheats one 
another and misleads national and international public opinion." 
  Officials said the two approaches were entirely at odds with 
each other. The government has insisted that Khmer Rouge agree 
to a truce before it makes a major political concession, by 
handing cabinet posts to guerrillas deemed "acceptable." 
  But the guerrillas say the plan is only acceptable provided 
the new power-sharing arrangement is introduced before the 
ceasefire. 
  They are also demanding that the existing government and 
parliament are scrapped -- a position that government officials 
say would utterly destroy the UN-led process of democratisation. 
  The Khmer Rouge -- blamed for the death of a million 
Cambodians in a reign of terror in the 1970s -- boycotted last 
year's UN-supervised polls and have since continued a guerrilla 
struggle against the government installed by the polls. 
  They control between 10 and 15 percent of the country, and 
stage hit-and-run raids on towns held by Cambodian armed forces, 
a ramshackle and poorly equipped alliance of former 
comrades-in-arms to the Khmer Rouge. 
  Under King Sihanouk's proposals, the ultra-nationalist 
guerrillas would surrender the land under their control, and 
merge their fighters with the Cambodian army. 
  Few in Phnom Penh were surprised by Thursday's deadlock. 
  A previous round hosted by King Sihanouk at his residence in 
North Korea last month also failed to make progress -- and on 
Wednesday, the monarch warned through his representative at the 
talks, Nhoek Chulong that he would not bother to organise 
further sessions if there were no headway. 
  Co-premier Hun Sen said earlier this week that he saw "no 
hope" for the negotiations and suggested the Khmer Rouge problem 
could be solved through a combination of social development and 
military pressure.

<F P=106> [Address by Chan Youran, leader of the Democratic Kampuchea </F>
[DK] delegation at the roundtable meeting in Phnom Penh on 15 
June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] With respect to the samdech [title of Nhoek 
Chulong, Sihanouk's representative at the meeting] royal 
representative: 
  I. Our Democratic Kampuchea delegation attends this meeting 
of the roundtable commission -- which was born of the roundtable 
meeting under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty [H.M.] King 
Norodom Sihanouk in Pyongyang on 27 May -- with a profound will 
to continue the process and efforts to achieve national 
reconciliation, national union, and genuine peace in Cambodia. 
  The roundtable is the inspiration of the king, who initiated 
this with a resolute desire to see the Cambodian motherland 
achieve national reconciliation, national union, and permanent 
peace so that all his children can live and earn a living 
normally. 
  II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] fully assists 
and supports the king's astute initiative because national 
reconciliation and national concord to unite all national forces 
and genuine and permanent peace in Cambodia are the sacred and 
profound aspirations of our entire nation and people at home and 
abroad. The Cambodian nation and people [words indistinct] do 
not need war. The war of more than a decade has made our nation 
and people go through great suffering and destruction. 
Therefore, whatever is making the war continue does not 
correspond to the interests of our nation and people. All kinds 
of problems, national and social, which are already serious, 
will worsen. War brings outside interference and allows 
foreigners an opportunity to split the nation and fuel the war 
even more. These are great dangers directly affecting the 
suvival of our Cambodian nation, people, and race. 
  As the king has reminded us, war will lead Cambodia to 
death, 
peace and national reconciliation will lead us to national 
survival. The king has shown that the way to save the nation and 
prevent it from extinction has only one magic formula: national 
reconciliation and union. As long as there are meetings and 
discussions, gradual results, be they small or large, will be 
achieved. 
  The samdech royal representative: 
  III. Our PDK delegation is happy with this meeting of the 
roundtable commission. We agree with the two items on the 
agenda set up by H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk on 5 June. These 
are: 
  1. Discussion of the unconditional, immediate, and permanent 
cease-fire throughout the country; 
  2. Discussion of the minimal policy program for national 
reconciliation and peace. 
  The two items are due for discussion at this meeting and at 
subsequent meetings of our roundtable commission because they 
are topical issues that have to be discussed. 
  IV. Concerning the item on the cease-fire, H.M. King Norodom 
Sihanouk has asked for a yes or no reply. Therefore, we would 
like to express our view on this matter in accordance with the 
king's question. 
  We, the PDK, are happy to have a cease-fire. We are happy 
for a cease-fire, now, we have been in the past, and we will be 
in the future because the PDK, like the rest of the nation and 
people, has been the victim. The PDK does not want to wage war 
and fight. The Cambodian nation and people do not want fighting 
and war. We want the war to end quickly and we want to achieve 
national reconciliation and peace quickly. We hold that it is 
necessary to establish a genuine and permanent cease-fire 
throughout the nation with proper and adequate control over the 
commission or technical group to be set up for this purpose. 
  V. On the minimal policy program, our view is that to 
achieve national reconciliation in accordance with the profound 
will and aspiration of our nation and people, all parties ought 
to compromise and make mutual concessions. We hold that to 
achieve national reconciliation and national union, all of us 
ought to have an acceptable basis on which to work together. On 
this basis, we will discuss together what the PDK should give to 
the two-prime ministers government and what the latter should 
give to the PDK. 
  The samdech royal representative: 
  VI. We hold that in the past, now, and in the future, all of 
us should put national reconciliation and national concord above 
everything else and strive to meet to discuss and gradually 
achieve results until we reach full achievement. 
  In this spirit, we would like to propose that our roundtable 
commission meet once or twice a month from now on. 
  Finally, we wish for good results from the meeting of our 
roundtable commission, chaired by the samdech royal 
representative, to move toward achieving national reconciliation 
and to rally all Cambodian national forces so that Cambodia has 
peace and that every Cambodian can live and earn a living 
peacefully forever.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 16 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia is concerned 
about the increasing tension on the Korean peninsula and hopes 
that conflicting sides return to the negotiating table to seek 
diplomatic solution, head of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM) 
Executive Board Nana Sutresna said here Thursday. 
  President Suharto has asked Nana Sutresna to investigate 
what 
steps he can take as the chairman of NAM to help ease the 
tension. 
  The tension in Korea has increased after some Western 
countries accuse North Korea of having nuclear facilities and 
keep pushing for Pyongyang nuclear inspections. 
  The United States has proposed economic sanction against 
North Korea at the UN level because Pyongyang resists the 
inspections. 
  North Korea announced this week it was pulling out of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency after resisting the 
inspection attempt. 
  Flanked by State Secretary/Minister Murdiono, Nana Sutresna 
was reporting to President Suharto results of the ministerial 
meeting of NAM held in Cairo, Egypt recently. 
  The participants of the Cairo meeting, according to 
Sutresna, 
hailed the steps taken by Indonesia as the current NAM chairman, 
in trying to help solve the problem on the Korean peninsula. 
  President Suharto has sent letters to North Korea President 
Kim Il-Song and UN Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali 
regarding the matter, he said. 
  He also explained about the upcoming NAM meeting in Jakarta 
to discuss the debt burden faced by the 18 most poorest 
countries which are members of NAM. 
  Meanwhile, the NAM chairman has appointed some Indonesian 
economists led by Wijoyo Nitisastro to help the NAM member 
countries solve their debt problem. 
  He said that apart from the 18 countries, there are other 
NAM 
members wishing to attend the Jakarta meeting expected to be 
held before August 17, the Indonesian Independence Day.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] BERITA BUANA discusses President Suharto's 
criticism of the recent press coverage of the country's purchase 
of 39 East German warships. Speaking at a ceremony to hand over 
three East German ships in Teluk Ratai, Lampung, President 
Suharto said press freedom had been abused in setting one person 
against another. 
  BERITA BUANA believes the head of state's remarks should 
serve as a warning to the press, which seems to make it appear 
that the purchase is handled by Minister for Research and 
Technology Habibie alone. The truth is that the purchase of the 
ships is jointly handled by the Indonesian Armed Forces 
headquarters, the Defense and Security Department, the Finance 
Department, the National Development Planning Agency, and the 
Agency for the Study and Application of Technology. Therefore, 
journalists are urged not to present half-truths in their 
coverage and they must also maintain their independence and 
sense of responsibility.

<F P=106> [Weekly news conference by President Fidel V. Ramos with </F>
domestic and foreign correspondents at Malacanang Palace in 
Manila -- live; passages in brackets in Tagalog] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ramos] I also have a 
statement in regard to the Korean peninsula nuclear issue. You 
will recall, ladies and gentlemen, that I made a statement on 
this just four days ago. But of course there are now new 
developments. 
  This is in regard to the still unconfirmed reports -- these 
are still unconfirmed -- that Pyongyang intends to withdraw from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. And if that step 
has not yet been officially taken by North Korea, we urge North 
Korea to remain in the IAEA so that an early and peaceful 
resolution through patient negotiation and creative diplomacy 
can be found to resolve this issue. 
  Our concern here stems from the possibility of nuclear 
proliferation, because such proliferation is a destabilizing 
factor for global and regional security, and in turn will derail 
and disturb and possibly [word indistinct] normal economic 
growth and sustained development in our part of the world, if 
not in the entire globe itself. And as a developing country, 
certainly, we want to move our economic, social, and political 
development forward without disturbances of this nature. 
  I also have a statement in regard to the reported testing by 
China four days ago, or 10 June, where a nuclear test was 
reportedly undertaken at its testing site at Lop Nur. And as 
you all know, as a signatory of the United Nations treaty on 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, the Philippines is strongly 
against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and this includes 
observance of a testing moratorium. So that in the end we hope 
that all of these tests will stop through a -- or be made to 
cease -- through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent Manny Mogato] With Pyongyang ominously 
sounding the war drums and with Seoul (?gearing) to dance to the 
same music, in case of actual conflict between the two Koreas, 
the United States -- being committed to the defense of South 
Korea -- will certainly be drawn into the war. Mr. President, 
will the Philippines be also drawn into the same conflict by 
virtue of our mutual defense treaty with the United States? 
  [Ramos] No, that's very, very farfetched. You will recall 
that the Philippines joined in the so-called police action on 
the Korean peninsula -- which was occasioned by the invasion by 
North Korea of South Korea across the 38th parallel -- because 
of a UN Security Council resolution, not a defense treaty with 
any country. But before we could send our troops there, a law 
had to be passed, and this was Republic Act 573, the so-called 
Peptok Law, passed by Congress in September 1950. So, it's not 
automatic that the Philippines rushes into the fray. After all, 
we are not the policeman of the world. But we have expressed 
our concern. 
  In my statement four days ago I cited five major reasons: 
  -- Because of our nonnuclear provisions in the 
Constitution, in the basic law; 
  -- Our membership in the IAEA board of governors, that is, 
Ambassador Rey Arcilla, who is based in Austria; 
  -- Our proximity to the Korean peninsula. We are close 
enough, we are much closer than the United States; 
  -- The some 13 -- to maybe more -- thousand Filipinos in 
South Korea; and; 
  -- I mentioned it a while ago, the possible crippling and 
paralysis of economic activity in our part of the world. 
  In which, again, [developing countries will become such a 
pity. The developed countries might benefit because of the war.] 
What about us? Those are my concerns. 
  So, we have called for patient negotiation, consultation, 
and 
creative diplomacy so that perhaps we can find the acceptable 
solutions before sanctions are applied. 
  [Mogato] Follow-up, Mr. President. As member of the ASEAN, 
what do you think will be the role of the ASEAN in diffusing the 
threats of war in the Korean peninsula? 
  [Ramos] Well, certainly the ASEAN-member countries can take 
positions as we have done on a national basis. We are of course 
always in consultation within ASEAN with our sister countries. 
But as far as I know, ASEAN as a bloc has not yet come up with 
a position. Although in the recent senior officers' meeting of 
the ASEAN Regional Forum which deals with security and defense 
matters, there was already at that level -- this is a lower 
level -- expressed the concerns of the ASEAN countries about the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  Of course, I think you are aware of the initiatives of 
Russia 
to convoke an international conference that will involve now the 
principal negotiators with the two Koreas. I hope that 
something will come out of this, because this is really in the 
realm of creative diplomacy and patient negotiation. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Thailand and three other countries of the lower 
Mekong basin are expected to reach an agreement for the use of 
the mighty Mekong River within two months, ending three years of 
painstaking negotiations, according to a UN official. 
  Denis J. Halliday, the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP)'s Resident Representative to Thailand and Hong Kong, said 
the agreement for the sustainable use of the Mekong is expected 
to be finalized between August and September. 
  "This is the hope of all four governments," he said. 
  The UNDP acts as facilitator for talks among the four 
riparian countries -- Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Victnam. 
  In February 1993 the four riparian countries agreed to set 
up 
a Mekong Working Group to draft a Future Framework of Mekong 
Cooperation before the end of 1993. A drafting working group 
under UNDP chairmanship was to focus on two areas; principles 
for the sustainable utilization of the Mekong River system; and 
institutional and management issues relating to the mechanism of 
cooperation. 
  "We are optimistic. A lot of work is on-going. There is a 
lot 
of donor interest. All four governments recognize the importance 
of water management. Governments work slowly and cautiously but 
it's happening," said Halliday. 
  The pending negotiation on the new framework has also 
technically suspended the official re-entry of Cambodia into the 
the 1957 Mekong committee. Although a Mekong official says the 
official admission of Cambodia is purely technical, the country 
itself was quite worried. 
  Ing Kieth, Cambodia's Minister of Public Works and 
Transport, 
said his country wishes to officially re-enter into the Mekong 
Committee as soon as possible so that the committee could be 
fully functional. 
  Cambodia dropped out in 1975 when Khmer Rouge guerillas took 
control of the country. The absence of Cambodia prompted 
remaining members to set up an Interim Mekong Committee in 1978. 
  Ing, who is also chief of the Cambodian Cabinet, was 
speaking 
after a four-day visit here at the invitation of the Ministry of 
Science Technology and Environment. 
  Dr. Prathet Sutabut, director general of the Department of 
Energy Development and Promotion, said that as soon as Cambodia 
signs an agreement to resume its membership of the panel, the 
Interim Mekong Committee will become the Mekong Committee. 
  "Cambodia has in fact resumed its participation in Mekong 
Committee activities in 1991 after signing the peace agreement 
in Paris. Now it wishes to officially resume membership," said 
Dr. Prathet who headed a Thai technical drafling working 
committee. 
  Prathet said the Interim Mekong Committee is now in the 
final 
stage of negotiation. He did not say when a meeting of the 
drafting committee would be held. It last met in January in 
Vientiane. 
  Ing Kieth said he had already conveyed Cambodia's wish on 
the 
issue to senior Thai ministers during his visit, including 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak and Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri. 
  "We want to nomlalize our participation in the Mekong panel. 
We agree to the necessity and importance of early 
re-establishment of the Mekong Committee. My country has been 
out of the activities. We need to rebuild the country to seek 
support from outside," Ing said. He expected that Prasong would 
convey this message to the Thai govemment. 
  Some sticking points remained with regard to the negotiation 
on Article 5 of the draft agreement concerning the utilization 
of water. Vietnam, located in the lowest stream, has expressed 
concems about the utilization of water of the upstream 
countries, in panicular that the diversion of waters from the 
mainstream and the use of water in the dry season will affect 
the flow downstream. 
  Ing Kieth said Cambodia appreciated Vietnam's concerns. If 
the upper countries consume much water, Vietnam would certainly 
suffer from the intrusion of sea water into its delta. 
  The minister urged the present negotiation also take into 
account Mekong committee's 1957 basis documents which provided 
safeguards against unfair use of water of the upstream nations. 
  Thailand was a leading opponent of the use of the old 
documents which it said constituted an interference in the 
upstream nations' sovereignty in using waters in the basin and 
and placed obstacle to the advancement of national water 
resource development related to the mainstream.

  [Text] Thailand will allow foreigners to hold more shares 
in the local insurance business as part of a liberalization 
policy, which in compliance with the GATT agreement. Speaking 
after opening the first ASEAN Insurance Congress at the 
Shangri-la Hotel in Bangkok yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister 
Suphachai Phanitchaphak stressed the need to draw up a plan 
aimed at expanding the insurance business in the future. Mr. 
Suphachai says the plan will call for the issuance of more 
licenses for operating the business here and for the expansion 
of equities held by foreigners. 
  At present foreigners are allowed to hold an equity of 25 
percent in a local insurance firm. The new plan is likely to 
allow foreigners to hold 49 percent of the total shares. Mr. 
Suphachai said ASEAN countries should formulate a joint plan to 
open their insurance markets. This is to provide a maximum 
benefit for those who use the service and to minimize effects on 
the business following the liberalization. He said ASEAN should 
also open a joint market in some areas to help strengthen the 
insurance business.

  [Text] The House of Representatives votes today on a 
controversial charter reform motion submitted by Phalang Tham 
[PTP] MPs, a crucial decision that could also decide the fate of 
hunger striker Chalat Worachat and the Chuan coalition. 
  The motion was put on the House agenda after the rebel 
Phalang Tham MPs who sponsored it won overwhelming support 
yesterday from their party colleagues that rendered the 
pro-Chuan Phalang Tham leadership helpless. With promised 
support from the opposition, the motion is certain to be moved 
up the agenda for deliberation today. 
  A New Aspiration Party source claimed last night Bunchu had 
told Chuan that he would resign as deputy prime minister to show 
political responsibility. 
  The report could not be immediately confirmed, but Chuan 
called an urgent meeting of coalition leaders before midnight. 
  Earlier, Bunchu was reported to have apologized to Chuan for 
the problems his party had caused the coalition. 
  Chalat is expected to end his protest if the motion is 
passed. But its passage would be a major snub to Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai, who has strongly opposed the "political 
intimidation" directed against his government. 
  Opposition parties will be a decisive factor in the 
tumultuous test of strength between Chuan and political action 
groups pushing aggressively for a brand new constitution. The 
motion needs simple majority support from MPs attending today's 
House meeting. 
  Chuan's Democrat Party yesterday rejected a face-saving 
compromise floated by some of the Phalang Tham MPs who sponsored 
the motion. They suggested that since the motion calls for the 
formation of a House committee to draft a new constitution, a 
committee already set up by Parliament President Marut Bunnak to 
study political reform should be entrusted with the job if the 
motion is passed. 
  Democrat Spokesman Akhom Engchuan reiterated yesterday that 
the democrats would not vote for the notion. But he said 
whatever decision was made today by the House, Chalat "must 
respect it". Democrat whip Churin Laksanavisit added that it was 
unlikely Democrats MPs would be allowed a free vote. 
  Government whips will meet today to finalize the coalition 
stand on the motion before it is debated. 
  The opposition bloc has pledged considerable support for the 
motion although the second biggest party, Chat Phatthana, said 
it would vote for the motion only if the MPs who sponsored it 
can justify their action. A faction in the Chat Thai Party 
vowed to block the motion, so did the tiny Prachakon Thai Party. 
  The opposition's announcement yesterday of its own motion 
seeking political reform strongly indicated the bloc "doesn't 
want to miss the democratic train," observers said. 
  Social Action Secretary-General Chaloem Yubamrung said 
yesterday the opposition would vote for the Phalang Tham motion 
  Prime Minister Chuan last night emphasized his belief the 
current pro-reform campaign was directed at his Democrat Party. 
But he was adamant that a House dissolution was not a way out 
of the crisis. 
  Asked if he would dissolve the House if the opposition 
joined 
with Phalang Tham to pass the motion, Chuan said: "It (House 
dissolution) is still very far off." 
  Chuan yesterday discussed the political situation with the 
Phalang Tham leadership, including Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu 
Rotchanasathian and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, 
Communications Minister Winai Somphong, and Deputy Interior 
Minister Chamni Sakdiset. 
  An informed source said Democrat leaders who had been 
analysing the political situation believed a House dissolution 
was inevitable if the Phalang Tham motion was passed today. 
  Chuan and other Democrat leaders went into a huddle with 
Phalang Tham leaders again at Parliament about 7 o'clock last 
night. A source who attended the meeting quoted Bunchu as 
expressing deep regret to Chuan for "having let Phalang Tham 
cause so many problems." 
  Bunchu also told Chuan to "wait and see what will happen" if 
the Phalang Tham motion was passed by Parliament, according to 
the source. It was not known if Bunchu was hinting he would 
resign or pull Phalang Tham out of the coalition to allow Chuan 
to bring in an opposition party in a Cabinet reshuffle. 
  Rumours abounded yesterday about the Democrats "approaching" 
two major opposition parties -- Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana. 
Chat Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha called an urgent meeting 
yesterday evening with deputy party leaders, said Chat Tha 
spokesman Pratuang Wichanpricha who admitted that he did not 
know what the meeting was all about. 
  Some Democrat MPs compared Phalang Tham with the Democrat 
Party six years ago when Democrat rebels doomed the Prem 
government by violating a coalition resolution on a copyright 
amendment. They said Phalang Tham would "owe the people an 
explanation" if the government crumbled as a result of the 
controversial motion. 
  An estimated 10,000 people turned up in front of Parliament 
yesterday to join a pro-Chalat rally. Leading reformists have 
already declared victory, voicing confidence that the motion 
would be surely passed. 
  But considering Chalat's initial demands, passage of the 
motion could be just the beginning of another painstaking 
process that might bring the whole episode back to square one, 
observers said. 
  Chalat started his hunger strike after the opposition and 
Senate joined hands to kill proposed constitutional amendments 
drawn up by an ad hoc House committee. But the emotional 
campaign and the Democrats' tough stand against "political 
intimidation" soon spiralled into an antigovernment crusade with 
opposition MPs joining the fray and supporting the radical 
reformists. 
  The government has pointed out that there is one question 
that the pro-Chalat side has tried to avoid: Will Chalat resume 
his fast if the Phalang Tham motion fails to produce 
satisfactory motion?

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief General Wimon Wongwanit 
yesterday welcomed the move to include representatives of the 
military on the Committee for Democratic Development set up by 
House Speaker Marut Bunnak. 
  He said all opinions should be heeded in a democracy. 
  Gen Wimon said people should not misinterpret the 
participation of the military as interference in politics. 
  "I have stated several times that the military has a policy 
of non-interference in politics. I will not let the Army become 
involved," he said. 
  Gen Wimon said soldiers and their families made up 300,000 
people, constituting a large part of the community. 
  "Opinions from all sectors should be listened to in a 
democracy." 
  He said he did not think it improper for military 
representatives to join the panel because "they can present 
another view on the panel". 
  "Don't you think military personnel are also Thai people who 
are entitled to political rights?" he asked. 
  Gen Wimon said although he was a soldier, he could not be 
barred from exercising his right under a democratic system. 
  "I have performed my duty under a democratic system and it 
does not involve my military career." 
  Gen Wimon said he had not yet been officially informed 
whether military representatives would be invited to join the 
committee. 
  He said he personally would not sit on the committee.

  [Text] A dissolution of Parliament would not have a 
significant negative impact on the country's economic growth, 
bankers and securities analysts said yesterday. 
  Despite the possibility that the government may dissolve 
Parliament or reshuffle the coalition if it fails to win a 
compromise over constitutional changes, many analysts are 
confident the growth rate for the entire year will stay above 8 
percent. 
  If the government motion for constitutional changes is 
defeated today and Parliament is dissolved, the shock to the 
economy would only last one to two months, according to Olan 
Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank. 
  Still, the growth rate for all of 1994 would remain above 8 
percent. He said the political crisis would not lead to a "dead 
end" for Thailand's economy which he predicted would post a 
growth rate of 8.1 percent even with a House dissolution. 
  "There is nothing to worry about in the short run. The world 
economy is recovering. There is nothing to worry about at all, 
even if Parliament is dissolved," he said optimistically in an 
interview with The Nation. 
  He emphasized yesterday that a change in the government was 
a 
normal process in a democracy. 
  The stock market reacted cautiously yesterday to the 
uncertain political outlook with a moderate 1.4 percent drop, by 
19.35 points to 1,359.53. 
  Olan said the government should decide how to best improve 
the situation. 
  "I believe that if the government announces a House 
dissolution tonight (last night), the stock index will rise 
tomorrow (this morning) since investors prefer a more stabilized 
situation," he said. 
  Worawi Wangli, president of Nakhonthon Bank, said the 
situation is not as bad as during the May 1992 bloodshed. 
  He said the Thai Bankers Association would not become 
involved in the political crisis. "This is the task of 
politicians," he said. 
  An analyst at Thai Investment &amp; Securities Co said if 
the 
government is defeated today, the stock market support line 
would be 1,332 points, and if the situation worsened, the index 
could plunge to 1,284 points. 
  "If the House is dissolved or the Cabinet is reshuffled, the 
resistance line may be between 1,372-1,392 points," the analyst 
predicted. 
  She added that any impact on the economy would be shortlived 
but she did not expect an important impact on the stock market 
as at most, only some political figures would be changed, and 
that would not dramatically affect economic structures. 
  Somchai Phakaphasawiwat, adviser to the House's economic 
subcommittee, said some infrastructure projects could be further 
delayed if there is a political change and that could affect the 
overall economy. However, economic growth will remain healthy 
as the budgets for the fiscal year would be spent as usual. 
  "The stock market may benefit from the change as foreign and 
local investors see a clearer political situation. Volatility 
may occur, but only for a short time," said Somchai.

    [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok vernacular dailies -- 
KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT and SIAM POST -- carry editorials commenting 
on the political situation following the submission to the House 
by 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's a motion to set up a new 
constitution redrafting committee, in a bid to ease up political 
tension following a hunger strike by activist Chalat Worachat. 
  KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT's 400-word editorial, on page 2, 
entitled: 
"For the Sake of Democracy, Do Not Stop Phalang Tham's Motion," 
notes that the setting up of the "Democracy Development 
Committee" proposed by House Speaker Marut Bunnak has, to a 
certain extent, alleviated the "severity" of the political 
tension caused by the hunger strike. "We are satisfied with the 
attitude of the government and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in 
this regard. However, it is necessary for all parties concerned 
to prove their sincerity with action." 
  The editorial says: "We regard as the right step the motion 
submitted by 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's for the deliberation of 
the house, the setting up of an extraordinary committee to 
compile, rewrite, and draft a constitution. 
  "The Phalang Tham MP's have done their job in the 
legislative 
branch. Such a move will not affect the image of the government 
or create any rift within the coalition. The Phalang Tham 
party's endorsement of the motion will prove that it truly 
adheres to the principles of democracy, and not the political 
etiquette of being a partner of the coalition government. We 
feel that the Democrat Party, as the leading core of the 
coalition, should be broad minded enough not to oppose the 
decision of the Phalang Tham Party." 
  In conclusion, the editorial says: "The government should 
generously allow the house speaker to place the motion on the 
house agenda as soon as possible. All political parties, both 
in the coalition and opposition bloc, must allow their MP's to 
vote freely with the sense of responsibility toward democratic 
development and the country." 
  SIAM POST's 350-word editorial, on page 4, entitled: 
"Democracy," notes: "Many political observers believe that the 
current political conflict will not lead to the violence of the 
'May 1992' incident because all concerned parties abide by the 
laws and are aware of their rights and freedom." 
  "The problem that may arise now is the effect of the Phalang 
Tham Party motion after it is passed into law on the 
now-functioning parliament constitutional amendment commission 
and the parliamentary mechanism. 
  "This is a new political phenomenon worth everybody's keen 
attention. Meanwhile, the New Aspiration Party is planning to 
submit a motion to the house to amend Article 211 of the 
Constitution to pave way for the formation of the constitution 
drafting council." 
  The editorial points out that the people are confused by 
political parties and politicians. "What is happening now 
indicates that our political parties and politicians lack unity 
and discipline. Hence, the cabinet cannot function smoothly and 
the parliamentary mechanism might eventually fall apart."

  [Text] Leipzig (DDP/ADN) -- The International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) has not yet been officially informed that North 
Korea is to leave. Statements from the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry have only come through the media, IAEA spokesman 
Hans-Friedrich Meyer said today on Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk 
(MDR). The IAEA inspectors have also not yet been asked to 
leave the country. 
  Meyer stressed that North Korea leaving the IAEA does not 
automatically mean it has to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. Separate control agreements exist here. These also 
still allow for on-the-spot checks. 
  According to the IAEA spokesman, the nuclear danger posed by 
North Korea is being "played up by the media." "The IAEA has 
never said that North Korea has bombs."

  [Text] Frankfurt am Main (DDP/ADN) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is expecting written confirmation 
today of North Korea's withdrawal from the organization, IAEA 
spokesman David Kyd said on Hessischer Rundfunk radio today. At 
the same time, Kyd contradicted reports over the past few days 
that North Korea had threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. "North Korea has not done that," Kyd 
stressed. 
  North Korea has been in a grey area after it announced in 
1993 that it would leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty but 
then withdrew this application at the last minute. "They are 
neither a member nor a nonmember of the treaty, but the 
community of nations considers North Korea still to be a 
member." Now we are concerned only with how the country will 
react in the future, he said. 
  As things stand, it does not appear that North Korea wants 
to 
sell material suitable for the production of nuclear weapons, 
Kyd said, but they had to continue to follow developments. 
Despite reports from the secret services, it is still not clear 
whether North Korea has nuclear bombs. The only thing they are 
certain of is that the country has more plutonium in its 
possession than it officially admitted to, Kyd said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- North Korea's Minister of 
People's Armed Forces O Chin-u said North Korea will never again 
permit inspections of its nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a speech carried 
Wednesday by Radio Pyongyang. 
  In a broadcast monitored in Tokyo by the SHIN-A NEWS AGENCY, 
O said North Korea took the "defensive measure of pulling out of 
the IAEA and will never again permit inspections" because of the 
agency's "arrogant and insolent" demands for nuclear checks. 
  The broadcast comes as IAEA officials are pointing out that 
despite North Korea's announcement Monday that it was pulling 
out of the agency, it is still subject to nuclear inspections by 
the IAEA under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  O's speech was made at a welcome reception for a Vietnamese 
military delegation visiting Pyongyang, led by Defense Minister 
Gen. Doan Khue, SHIN-A reported.

<F P=106> [By Wilfredo G. Reyes] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has reaffirmed its commitment to a common 
economic exploration and development program for the disputed 
Spratly Island group but has remained silent on an accompanying 
proposal for a phased military force reduction among contending 
claimants in the area. 
  In an official statement, House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr., 
who is currently in Beijing in his official capacity as 
president of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
Inter-parliamentary Organization (AIPO), said Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reaffirmed his 
country's support for the adoption of a common economic 
exploration and development program in the area. 
  Messrs. de Venecia and Qian agreed that a common economic 
development program in the island group "could include 
fisheries, minerals, oil and gas exploration, maritime 
arrangements, and weather forecasting." 
  But Mr. Qian was noncommittal on Mr. de Venecia's remarks 
regarding a four-year old proposed "concomitant reduction of 
forces (which) would be a prelude to eventual demilitarization 
of the Spratlys." However, Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin of 
Beijing's National People's Congress (NPC) assured the AIPO 
delegation that Chinese parliamentarians support proposals for 
contending parties to temporarily shelve their claims to 
sovereignty to the islands. 
  Current strategic assessments of forces stationed in the 
islands have manifested continuing constructions of air and 
naval support facilities, aimed at facilitating force buildup 
during crisis situations. 
  The AIPO delegation had earlier held discussions with 
President Jiang Zemin, NPC standing committee chairman and 
former security chief Qiao Shi, as well as Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Zhu Liang, during which Mr. Jiang had vaguely 
assured the delegation that his government would "play a 
positive role, not a negative role" in dealing with the 
currently brewing crisis in the Korean peninsula. 
  Mr. Jiang had also issued the customary assurance that his 
country "will not be a threat to its neighbors in Asia or to 
world peace," pointing out that increases in his country's 
defense budget were caused merely by "inflation adjustment." 
  For his part, Mr. de Venecia sought views on China's 
experiences with special economic zones, reforestation, forest 
conservation, mass housing, operation of township enterprises, 
and waste disposal. 
  Mr. de Venecia led a 12-man ASEAN delegation composed of 
Reps. Antonio Cuenco of Cebu, Victor Ortega of La Union, and 
Roque Ablan Jr. of Ilocos Norte; Deputy Speaker Eugene Yap Giau 
Cheng and Teo Tee of Singapore; Tjokong Tarigan Sibero and 
Benjamin Massakh of Indonesia; Shahidan Kassim and Chor Chee 
Heung of Malaysia; and, Adm. Prawit Siwaraks and Burirak Namwat 
of Thailand.

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum opened a four-day working-level meeting 
here Monday to discuss manpower development. 
  The 10th meeting is being attended by representatives from 
17 
APEC member countries, Chile, which is scheduled to join the 
group in November, and the Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Committee (PECC). 
  Discussions will be held in four subcommittees -- the 
education forum, the economic development network, the 
management network and the industrial technology network. 
  Participants are expected to concentrate on an occupational 
training program proposed by South Korea at the fifth APEC 
ministerial conference and the manpower development projects 
agreed at the APEC leaders' meeting in Seattle, Washington, last 
year. 
  The APEC occupational training program calls for exchanges 
of 
teachers, technology and technicians, job training, equipment 
support and the formation of a network to exchange information 
on occupational training. 
  Pae Yong-sik, an official of South Korea's Economic Planning

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>
  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 6 Jun -- The aim of the newly created 
Mongolian Democratic Rebirth Party is the renewal of the country 
on the basis of democratic principles and taking into account 
the specific conditions and tasks of our society at the present 
stage, as well as the principles of human civilization as a 
whole. Dashiyn Byambasuren said this today in an interview with 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He opened the founding forum of 
this new political force today with brief introductory remarks. 
The former head of the first multiparty coalition government in 
Mongolia's history set up an organizing committee with a group 
of like-minded people, which submitted a report "On the 
sociopolitical situation in the country and the tasks of the 
party" and the draft rules and program of the Mongolian 
Democratic Rebirth Party for debate by delegates. 
  We favor a state with strong democratic power, a society of 
civic accord and genuine market relations in the economy. Our 
party regards strong presidential power and a small, highly 
professional parliament to be most acceptable for Mongolian 
conditions, D. Byambasuren noted. 
  On the matter of collaboration with other political forces, 
D. Byambasuren said: "We favor close cooperation with all 
parties if our views are common or similar. The Mongolian 
Democratic Rebirth Party favors the formation of a general 
democratic front." 
  Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian at 1117 GMT on 6 
June notes the following: 
  "Congress delegates adopted the party's rules and program 
and 
elected its ruling bodies. Dashiyn Byambasuren becomes chairman 
of the party, and the publicist Luvsangiyn Purevdorj its general 
secretary. With this the congress concluded its work."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Vietnam wants to join 
international mechanisms in the Asia-Pacific region, Vietnamese 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan said here Thursday [16 June]. 
  In a 20-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, 
Vu Khoan thanked Japan for calling on the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to expand its 
assistance to Indochina countries, including Vietnam, at last 
week's OECD meeting in Paris, foreign ministry officials said. 
  Vu Khoan was quoted as telling Kakizawa that Vietnam is 
making preparations to join the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). 
  He did not specify any other Asia-Pacific groupings Vietnam 
is interested in joining, but Hanoi has expressed willingness to 
participate in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) 
and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the 
future, according to the officials. 
  Kakizawa replied that Japan wants to help Vietnam take 
active 
part in the Asia-Pacific region and will continue to make 
efforts to expand OECD assistance to the region, the officials 
said. 
  Turning to Vietnam's diplomatic relations, Vu Khoan told 
Kakizawa that ties with the United States are improving, with 
the two sides recently agreeing to set up liaison offices in 
each other's country. 
  Vietnam's relations with China are also improving, although 
some problems remain, and Hanoi wants to solve those problems 
through negotiations, Vu Khoan was quoted as saying. 
  Negotiations over several disputed land and sea boundaries, 
including the row over the Spratly Islands, have been under way 
since Vietnam and China reestablished diplomatic relations in 
1991, but have failed to make much progress. 
  Kakizawa welcomed Vietnam's recent economic and social 
developments and told Vu Khoan he hopes Hanoi will continue 
making efforts to normalize relations with China and the U.S., 
the officials said. 
  Kakizawa and Vu Khoan agreed to cooperate in implementing 
Japan's economic cooperation with Vietnam, they said.

  [Text] Russia is the last leg of Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet's visit to the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia 
is a large trading partner of Vietnam and the country is still 
regarded as the powerful nation in the eyes of a large number of 
people in the world. On this occasion, the Voice of Vietnam 
brings you a review of economic relations between Vietnam and 
Russia, and also between Russia and other countries. 
  To broaden economic ties with the outside world is an 
obvious 
strategy for the current economic situation in Russia. Russia 
has been turning military friends into economic partners as well 
as traditional trading partners including Germany and other 
countries in Eastern Europe. Russia has entered the markets in 
some Western European countries and Asia, especially Northern 
Asia. 
  Since 1990, relations between South Korea and Russia have 
developed favorably. Two-way trade reached $1.6 billion in 
1993, doubling that of the previous year. China has become the 
second biggest trading partner of Russia after Germany. Being 
an heir of the former USSR, Russia has been integrating into 
economic cooperation in the region. The shuttled mission of 
Russian economic groups to the Asia-Pacific region demonstrates 
the country's interest in broadening economic ties in the region. 
  Russia has been a traditional trading partner of Vietnam. 
Two-way trade value exceeded the target of $300 million, mainly 
in energy, oil and gas exploitation, industry, agriculture, 
trade, and transport. 
  Together with the visit to Russia by Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and the visit to Vietnam by Russian 
Deputy Prime Minister Yarov, the visit to Russia by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet will create new prospects for bilateral 
cooperation between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Doan Duy Thanh, chairman of Vietnam Chamber </F>
of Commerce and Industry by an unidentified radio correspondent 
on the former's recent visit to the UK, France, Belgium, and 
Italy; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Summary] [Doan Duy Thanh] The visit to Western European 
countries by the Vietnamese delegation of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry was aimed at increasing contacts with our 
counterparts in the UK, France, Belgium, and Italy to enable a 
better exchange of working experiences. The chambers of 
commerce in these countries have been established for nearly a 
hundred years. Therefore, we need to exchange management and 
organizational experiences with our colleagues in those 
countries. We also went there to look for import-export and 
trading counterparts. 
  [Correspondent] "Despite being very far away from us, the 
government and people of these Western European countries have 
sympathized with and lent great material and spiritual support 
to Vietnam. What is their current understanding and evaluation 
of the renovation undertaking in Vietnam? Is there anything new 
in their assistance to Vietnam?" 
  [Doan Duy Thanh] It is possible to say that these countries 
highly evaluate the Vietnamese renovation. They always say that 
Vietnam can become a country with a strong economy. They also 
say that the direction taken by Vietnam is correct. In 
particular, they highly evaluate our political stability because 
an economy cannot succeed without political stability. 
  These four countries have enjoyed time-honoured relations 
with our country. They all want to help us. For example, 
England is the first country to sponsor their importers and 
exporters in doing business with Vietnam. France has helped 
Vietnam a lot in dealing with the Paris Club and the IMF. 
However, the businessmen in these four countries do not 
thoroughly understand Vietnam's economic situation. On our 
trip, we tried to help them with their misgivings by clearly 
presenting Vietnam's difficulties, problems, and favorable 
conditions for business. 
  [Correspondent] "Dear comrade, the UK, France, Belgium, and 
Italy all are developed countries. According to you, what can 
Vietnam learn from these countries?" 
  [Doan Duy Thanh] Those countries have a lot of experience in 
business management. They also possess a high level of 
technology in many areas. They can help us and we can learn 
from them in the fields of the capital market, business 
consultancy, the introduction of a share holding system, banking 
services, auditing, computing, tourism, port and airport 
management, and so forth. 
  [Correspondent] Could you brief us on the commercial 
cooperation between Vietnam and those countries and the 
prospects for that cooperation in the future? 
  [Doan Duy Thanh] Our development has been very good in 
recent 
years. Regarding trading, it is possible to say that our goods 
have penetrated all markets. We spotted Vietnamese goods in 
France, Italy, Belgium, and the UK. With new favorable 
conditions, I think Vietnamese goods will definitely do better 
in the Western European and European Common markets. 
  [Correspondent] "Thank you, comrade."

  [Text] Australia says the international community may have 
no choice but to take stronger action against North Korea 
following its decision to withdraw from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. Camille Funnell reports in a statement 
issued from New York Australia's foreign minister, Senator 
Evans, called on North Korea to reconsider its decision: 
  [Begin Funnell recording] Senator Evans said uncertainty 
about the nature of North Korea's nuclear activity is the cause 
of instability in the Asia-Pacific region, and he said it 
undermines the interest of all countries in the region in 
preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Senator Evans warned 
the international community will have little choice but to take 
stronger action, including through the United Nations Security 
Council, if North Korea does not display a more constructive 
position. He said it is in everyone's interest, not the least 
to North Korea, to reconsider its decision and return to the 
negotiating table. [end recording]

  [Text] The Australian Government has called in China's 
ambassador to Australia to protest last week's nuclear test by 
China. Camille Funnell reports that the Chinese envoy was 
summoned by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
  [Funnell] Australian officials say that ambassador Chunlai 
Shi was told Canberra strongly protested the underground 
explosion on 10 June. Officials say the ambassador was reminded 
Australia was one of the countries that protested China's last 
nuclear test in October 1993. The ambassador was told China's 
latest test was out of step with efforts to negotiate a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, with China's own support 
for nuclear disarmament, and also with its commitment to 
negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty by 1996.

  [Text] Australia has warned the South Pacific to improve 
its economic performance in a speech in Sydney by Pacific 
Affairs Minister Gordon Bilney. In Australia's first policy 
statement on the Pacific since the end of the Cold War, Mr. 
Bilney warns that donor countries cannot continue giving aid if 
Pacific island governments don't pursue high economic growth. 
Mr. Bilney said past policies had not worked despite large 
injections of aid and growth is still low, unlike comparable 
Caribbean economies. Mr. Bilney said the South Pacific must 
urgently face problems like population explosion and 
deforestation to avoid a nightmare vision of mass unemployment, 
urban slums, and lawlessness. Among the most controversial 
areas in Australia's policy advice is selling off indebted 
national airlines and filling up land, which are generally held 
in commune to attract foreign investment.

  [Text] Australia's space research program has taken a step 
forward with the opening of an earth resources satellite station 
in Hobart. The $2.7 million [Australian dollars] facility was 
built by the University of Tasmania; the federal government's 
scientific research organization, the CSIRO [Commonwealth 
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization]; and the 
Australian Space Council. 
  (Don Chocran) of the Space Council says the station will be 
used to receive information from space on the state of the 
earth, including oceans, weather pattern, and temperatures: 
  [Begin (Chocran) recording] The ground station is used for 
receiving images from satellites in space -- those are optical 
images and radar images. And in addition to its use to 
monitoring the environment, it's also used as a backup for the 
Alice Springs station which receive data or images from space 
for monitoring our resources and our environment. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia is looking to dramatically expand trade 
and investment links with its nearest Asian neighbor, Indonesia. 
Later this month, Prime Minister Paul Keating will be making 
his third trip to Jakarta in just two years to promote 
Australian business. He is preceded by Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans, who was in the Indonesian capital last night to launch 
the biggest trade promotion Australia has yet staged in Asia. 
Michael Marr was there. 
  [Begin recording] [Marr] The Australia Today promotion got 
off to a musical start in Jakarta last night where jazz 
musicians played at the opening of this three-week business and 
cultural exposition. The two nations, which have had their fair 
share of disagreements over the past few decades, got enough 
beat to get into a program and as Foreign Minister Gareth Evans 
put it, a good and needed ballast to the relationship. And in 
this case, its ballast is a commercial kind. Some 500 companies 
are expected to take part in the $12 million Australia Today 
promotion despite the problems of red tape and the importance of 
good political connections. Senator Evans argues there are 
several opportunities for Australian business in this country of 
190 million people. 
  [Evans] When you've got a country of 190 million people, 
almost, the fourth biggest in the world, with a rapidly 
developing economy as this one has, right on our doorstep, maybe 
it's simply crazy not to recognize the scale and the opportunity 
that it represents. 
  [Marr] Has enough been done in the past to expand the 
commercial ties between Australia and Indonesia? 
  [Evans] Well, there have been a lot of Australian businesses 
with their feet on the ground now for a very long time and I 
think their credibility has been important in building the base 
on which we're now erecting and further extending. I think the 
government has worked very hard at developing the kind of 
climate within which business can flourish and that's happened 
particularly of course over the last four or five years. 
Generally speaking however, it's important that Australian 
businesses themselves get out and put the groundwork [words 
indistinct]. Governments can only do so much. At the end of the 
day it's the entrepreneurial instinct that's going to win the 
reward. 
  [Marr] Now, $12 million has been spent on this promotion and 
it's bound, of course, to promoting Australian business here. 
Some people have suggested that it would be far better to adopt 
a direct, high profile, more targeted strategy. Is this going 
to work? 
  [Evans] What this is all about is changing basic innovative 
perception. There's still the perception up here that we are a 
land of mines and tourist beaches and agriculture -- another 
socially developed high-tech, value-added, capable kind of a 
society; and that matters when people at the decision-making 
level, not only in government but in business, are determining 
whether or not to trade with [words indistinct] or accept an 
investment or engage in a joint venture. You've got to have a 
background perception that work for a truly sophisticated 
advanced country. We know from surveys that that perception is 
not quite spread about at the moment and this whole promotion is 
about changing just that perception. 
  [Marr] The organizers of Australia Today say they'd be 
scrupulous in following up their efforts. Such big time 
promotions elsewhere in Asia have produced variable results in 
the past. If that's so, Indonesia need to show some tangible 
outcome if it's to justify a $12 million budget. [end recording]

  [Text] Opposition parties today boycotted Fiji's 
parliament after Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka warned that 
there might be another coup against the government and that it 
might involve bloodshed. Mr. Rabuka, who led the two coups in 
1987, told parliament during a debate on crime and punishment, 
there could be no guarantee Fiji would not have another coup nor 
that it would be bloodless as was the case in 1987. The prime 
minister said some people blamed present lawlessness in Fiji on 
the 1987 coups but he would not apologize for having overthrown 
the elected government of the late Dr. Timoci Bavandra. 
  Mr. Rabuka pointed to a recent speech in which President 
Ratu 
Sir Kamisese Mara warned that poor urban Fijians could become a 
destabilizing force if their situation was not improved. 
Referring to the fact that Fiji's Indian population represent 
the bulk of the business class, Mr. Rabuka said indigenous 
Fijians felt disadvantaged and that their (?souls) were 
starving. With new circumstances he said no one could guarantee 
there would not be another coup. Following Mr. Rabuka's remark, 
members of the opposition National Federation Party and the Fiji 
Labor Party walked out and refused to return causing the House 
of Representatives to adjourn its proceedings until tomorrow.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Papua New Guinea [PNG] has suddenly found it 
difficult to borrow overseas to fund its increasing budget 
deficit. To secure its latest loan, it had to sign over to a 
syndicate of foreign banks led by the Union Bank of Switzerland 
first rights to government revenue from major resource projects. 
Here is Sean Dorney. 
  [Begin recording] [Dorney] PNG has received something of a 
jolt from the international commercial banking community. In 
its first attempt in a number of years to borrow from 
non-concessional sources overseas, it has found the banks 
reluctant and skeptical about its financial management. The PNG 
Government was looking to borrow US$160 million that it wanted 
to repay over five years. But, after 12 months of tough 
negotiations, it could get only US$90 million to be paid back 
over three years and it had to give the banking syndicate led by 
the Union Bank of Switzerland rights to first call over its 
revenues from its mining and oil projects. They'll be paid into 
a bank account in London and if PNG defaults the banks take the 
revenue. The resource revenues in taxes and dividends are paid 
into what is called the mineral resources stabilization fund. 
And the finance minister, Masket Iangalio, had to push an 
amendment bill through the PNG parliament last week to allow 
payment into the fund to go to London, not to the Bank of PNG. 
The fund was set up in the 1970s to help PNG cope with wide 
fluctuations in revenue resulting from sharp movements in the 
world's prices of copper and gold. PNG's former prime minister, 
Rabbie Namaliu, is aghast at the bank's demand. 
  [Namaliu] What concerns me and the opposition very much is 
the fact that this is the first time ever in our history since 
independence that we have been asked to mortgage national assets 
to foreign banks in order for us to obtain commercial loan. And 
that's really worrying because not even our grit [as heard] has 
been accepted by commercial banks, and, in fact, before we could 
go and borrow commercially without problems and risk because, 
basically because, the international financial community still 
had a great deal of confidence in this country. 
  [Dorney] Mr. Namaliu claims that confidence has been wrecked 
by the Wingti government's policies of the past three years 
including such moves as renegotiating the Pago gold mine 
agreement. The finance minister, Mr. Iangalio, admits he is 
disappointed by the terms demanded by the foreign banks. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Vanuatu is calling for greater trade among South 
Pacific island countries to address economic problems raised by 
Australia in the launching of its policy statement on the South 
Pacific. 
  Speaking in Sydney yesterday, Australia's minister for 
Pacific island affairs, Gordon Bilney, warned the South Pacific 
that it must improve its economic performance to avoid a bleak 
future. Vanuatu's prime minister, Maxime Carlot Korman, says 
Australia has raised the issues at the right time: 
  [Begin Korman recording] I think the subject announced by 
Mr. 
Bilney is the subject of the day. It is so important and I 
think we can work together to find a solution and make the 
situation change in the level of economy. [end recording] 
  However, Mr. Carlot Korman said he does not believe the 
situation is as bad as Australia has suggested. In his address, 
Mr. Bilney said that unless the region faces its problem 
urgently the result could be urban slums, mass unemployment, and 
lawlessness.

<F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; first </F>
in a series entitled "Japan and the United States -- the Picture 
Shakes": "President Becomes an `Organ'"; first graph is 
newspaper's introduction] 
  [Text] Just as the Cold War has ended and Asia is rising, 
Japan-U.S. relations are shaking up from the foundation in all 
aspects including politics, economy, and security. In the five 
decades since the end of the world war, Japan has depended on 
the United States for leads to finding "answers" to economic 
problems as well as "answers" to diplomatic issues. But now 
with the world changing, the leads are also becoming 
complicated. The two countries' relations have changed from 
those of Japan "running after" the United States to those of the 
two "running in parallel," with an eye on each other. 
<H5>  Disappeared Face of Human Rights </H5>
  Several influential local U.S. newspapers in their 31 May 
issues carried in their readers' letter columns a little 
extraordinary contribution. The letter related to a Clinton 
administration decision made earlier to extend the most favored 
nation (MFN) status for China. 
  "U.S. exports to China have generated new jobs for 150,000 
people. In the 21st century, China will become a major pillar 
of the world economy." Insisting so, the letter made fervent 
pleas that the extension of the MFN status was very beneficial 
to the United States. The letter ended with: "By Bill Clinton, 
U.S. President." 
  President Clinton has in the past repeatedly criticized 
China 
for belittling human rights, and has taken a cautious stand on 
the question of extending MFN status to that country. But in 
the letter, the president's face as a "human rights defender" 
was gone. 
  About a year and a half have passed since Mr. Clinton became 
the first president after the Cold War ended. The United States 
has begun to comment on Clinton in various manners. He has been 
called "inconstant," "unprincipled," "a commoner," "a president 
who talks to people open heartedly," and so forth. All of these 
expressions are rather right on target as far as we see in 
letters to newspapers. 
  But what is coming to be accepted more popularly in 
Washington recently is the view that this president has brought 
more fundamental change to the United States. "He has 
fundamentally changed the U.S. President's image" as Ann Luis, 
former vice chairman of the Democratic Party National Committee, 
said. 
<H5>  Political Robot </H5>
  A U.S. President is always compelled to make decisions and 
to 
carry them out. Kennedy did it at the time of the Cuban crisis, 
Reagan at the time of U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks, Bush at 
the time of the Gulf War, and so forth. There has always been 
an image of a U.S. President being a "great gun on a great ship." 
  In contrast, however, President Clinton is a sort of 
"organ." 
He considers presidency as a function or an organ, and deals 
with issues mechanically. 
  Evidence that endorse this view is countless. Let us take 
the ranking officials' meetings in the White House. The 
president is said to often ask the following kind of question of 
the officials at those meetings: "Wait a minute. One of your 
subordinates said something a little differently 10 days ago. 
This way, we cannot make a correct judgment." 
  According to WASHINGTON POST reporter Bob Woodward, 
Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, described 
his impression of Clinton on seeing him for the first time: "He 
does not need any presidential assistants. He himself is an 
assistant." 
  His abilities in collecting information is so great as to be 
called "the president who has met more executives than anyone in 
history" ranging from big corporation heads to small and medium 
businessmen." He has a superb memory. An American journalist 
said: "He can recall the name of a reporter whom he met more 
than a year ago, after staring at him for a while. 
  From him emerges an image of "a political robot equipped 
with 
high-tech components" rather than someone with resolve and power 
to carry out his resolve to quote a person with Heritage 
Foundation, a Republican Party think tank. As long as he is a 
"robot," he will not hesitate to change his position, depending 
on the information fed into him. 
  The extension of the MFN status for China was only one 
example. Over the Haiti issue, he did not hesitate to go back 
on his earlier word and to decide to accept refugees from there. 
When he found Congressional objections strong on the issue of 
reducing financial deficits, he did not hesitate to drop the 
idea of introducing a new energy tax that had been a major 
selling point [in his policy on reducing deficits]. "Being 
inconstant" is not the right expression for him because all 
these things are conclusions that a political robot would arrive 
at only naturally. 
<H5>  Neither White Nor Black </H5>
  One might ask if this new image of a president would 
continue 
even after Clinton. On that question, the prevailing 
observation in the present United States is that it would 
probably "continue" into the future. 
  The first reason for this is that Clinton was elected by the 
people of the "baby boomer generation" who were born after the 
world war -- the group now with dominant power in the United 
States. Arthur Michel, an attorney who is well versed in 
Japan-U.S. issues, remarked: "A major unique point of the baby 
boomers is that their sense of value varies. At this time when 
U.S. citizens' sense of values has diversified, if policies are 
set firm around some axis, they will work only to their 
disadvantage. 
  The second reason is that now with the Cold War structure 
gone, the other superpower, which the United States could use as 
an "opposite-pole yardstick" in making its own judgment, has 
disappeared. Consequently, U.S. behavior has come to bear a 
color that is "neither white nor black." 
  There can be differences of view on the question of whether 
the U.S. President's image has changed because of Clinton. At 
least there is no question to the fact that the present 
presidency has changed into a functional type and is able to 
change its positions easily. A key to understanding the 
present-day United States can be found in that fact, however 
strange it may sound.

<F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; second </F>
in a series entitled "Japan and the United States -- The Picture 
Shakes": "Ally Is Ignorant of the Security Pact?"] 
  [Text] On the seventh floor of the U.S. State Department 
building, there is a section behind a heavy door with frosted 
glass. Behind this door are the offices of the secretary and 
deputy secretary, and a conference room. Each morning, Deputy 
Secretary Strobe Talbott assembles the department's 20 assistant 
secretaries in a room decorated entirely in the English style 
for a staff meeting. 
<H5>  "Pearl Harbor Syndrome" </H5>
  The central topic at the 2 June staff meeting was how to 
deal 
with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of nuclear 
arms. On the previous day, Hans Blix, International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) secretary general, had just reported to the 
UN Security Council that it had become impossible to verify 
whether North Korea engaged in nuclear development in the past. 
Both Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary for 
political-military affairs who is in charge of the issue, and 
Winston Lord, assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, were present at the meeting. 
  The State Department had so far regarded the North Korean 
nuclear issue as one link in the global issue of "nuclear 
nonproliferation." The fact that Lord gave a long briefing 
during the day's meeting shows that the State Department has 
begun to perceive the problem as a security issue for East Asia. 
On the day after the meeting, Shunji Yanai, director general of 
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Foreign Policy Bureau, and 
Kim Sam-hun, ROK envoy in charge of the nuclear issue, came to 
the State Department. 
  As the focus of the issue is turning to East Asia, a certain 
anxiety is spreading in the United States. William Watts, 
president of Potomac Associates, which specializes in public 
opinion polls, calls this the "Pearl Harbor syndrome," meaning, 
distrust of Japan. Watts says, "If Japan does not cooperate in 
economic sanctions in the North Korean issue, or it restricts 
the use of U.S. military bases in Japan, the U.S. Congress will 
explode." That is, right now, after North Korea has announced 
its withdrawal from the IAEA, the relationship of trust between 
Japan and the United States may collapse from its very 
foundation depending on how the problem is handled. 
<H5>  "No" is Not Acceptable </H5>
  THE WASHINGTON POST's editorial on 5 June pointed out that 
in 
case of a North Korean crisis, it would be more difficult to 
build an alliance in the Pacific, compared to forming an 
alliance against Iraq during the Gulf war. It said, the reasons 
are: North Korea has close relations with Japan, and pacifist 
tendencies in Japan make Japan take a passive attitude toward 
security issues. 
  It seems that the U.S. message to Japan on this issue, 
expressed in various forms, is: "Do not take an indifferent 
attitude; deal with it seriously." 
  How does Japan react to this? During the intergovernmental 
discussions on the Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) program in 
Tokyo last year, which lasted for nine hours, the Japanese team 
spoke only for a total of seven minutes. 
  Of course, within the Japanese Government, many people have 
come to realize the seriousness of the situation. For example, 
after U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit last April, 
various government offices, including the Cabinet Security 
Affairs Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Defense 
Agency, have compiled their own reports. These documents 
discuss possible actions North Korea may take, the responses of 
Japan and the United States, and amendments that will be needed 
to Japanese laws. 
  According to U.S. Government officials, when Perry came to 
Japan, the United States asked for "Japan's cooperation within 
the limits of the Constitution." What this means in more 
precise terms is: The United States will not ask Japan to send 
its Self-Defense Forces to the Korean peninsula, but with regard 
to the use of U.S. military bases in Japan, when prior 
consultations are held with Japan in accordance to the "Exchange 
of Notes" on Article VI of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan 
should not say "no." Japanese Government reports have generally 
agreed to this line of argument. 
No Consensus Among Government Ministries and Agencies 
  However, U.S. concerns are not limited to advance 
preparations for the crisis. Recently, the following incident 
occurred: 
  Concerning the issue of remittances from Japan to North 
Korea, the Ministry of Finance sent a senior official to the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury to inform it that, "Under 
current laws, it would be difficult to completely halt 
remittances." This incident became a basis for major U.S. 
newspapers to report that "Japan is not positive about sanctions 
against North Korea." Disconcerted by such reports, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs quickly defended Japan by saying "we can halt 
the remittances," and it pleaded with the State Department that 
"to avoid aggravating American distrust of Japan, the U.S. 
Government should issue a statement announcing 'Japan says it 
can do it [stop the remittances]'." 
  The major U.S. papers have now modified their previous 
reports, stating that Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said at the 
Japan-ROK foreign ministerial meeting that "taking gradual steps 
is important; Japan intends to take responsible action within 
the limits of the Constitution." The United States is certainly 
unsettled at Japan's lack of international sense as evidenced by 
the fact that powerful Japanese ministries have given 
contradictory information to the side on an issue closely 
affecting Japan. 
  A number of senior officials of the previous U.S. 
administration criticize the Clinton administration, saying, "If 
it were the Bush administration, we would have obtained China's 
cooperation, and solved the problem earlier." Such a criticism 
applies to Japan, if you paraphrase a little: "If the Japanese 
Government's strategy were more viable, we would have..."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Akio Takahata] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 13 Jun -- Concerning the DPRK's 
announcement on 13 June of its withdrawal from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN diplomatic source indicated: 
"The act is in line with a carefully-worked out plan for phased 
steps to deal with moves of the United States and Europe." The 
DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its 
official secession from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT). Pyongyang's decision to pull out of the IAEA is 
considered an act aimed at upgrading its diplomatic cards by 
showing the United States and the United Nations its readiness 
"to withdraw from the NPT anytime." 
  The purpose of participating in the IAEA is to promote 
exchanges, and to study knowhow and technology for the peaceful 
use of nuclear power -- which is a different purpose from 
joining the NPT. Also, according to the rules, the DPRK's 
withdrawal from the IAEA will not immediately lead to its 
departure from the NPT. 
  In a government statement, North Korea referred to its 
"special position" of holding up a decision to withdraw from the 
NPT. It is necessary for Pyongyang to maintain this special 
position to continue to reject demands to accept nuclear 
inspections in accordance with safeguard arrangements, while 
remaining in the NPT.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Yi Tong-pok, former special </F>
assistant to the ROK prime minister, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's 
Yukiyoshi Fujimura in Seoul; date not given; first paragraph is 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The ROK has so far taken a generally calm attitude 
with regard to the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
development of nuclear arms. However, after North Korea started 
to adopt a tough position, beginning with the replacement of 
nuclear fuel rods, quarters concerned and experts in South Korea 
are beginning to take a more pessimistic view that "may be the 
suspicions are true." One such person is Yi Tong-pok, former 
special assistant to the prime minister, and spokesman for the 
ROK delegation during the North-South prime ministerial talks. 
We interviewed Yi on what the DPRK will do next. 
  [Fujimura] How do you view the tough attitude adopted by 
North Korea? 
  [Yi] Looking at the recent exchanges, I do not think they 
are merely using the development of nuclear arms as a "nuclear 
card." They have now clearly indicated their intention to 
develop nuclear arms. 
  [Fujimura] What do you think is the present state of their 
development of nuclear weapons? 
  [Yi] North Korea already possesses enough plutonium to make 
one to three atomic bombs. Given another two years, they will 
actually be able to make nuclear bombs. They are also building 
two new reactors. Compared to existing reactors, one will have 
10 times the capacity of current reactors, and the other, 40 
times. Together, they can produce 200 kg of plutonium each year. 
This means that if things go on like this, North Korea will 
become a nuclear superpower in three or four years. 
  [Fujimura] Will North Korea compromise under the pressure of 
economic sanctions? 
  [Yi] Because the United States has been sending the wrong 
signals to North Korea recently, North Korea is taking the 
United States lightly. It probably thinks that the United 
States is incapable of imposing economic sanctions. 
  [Fujimura] Do you think there is a possibility that North 
Korea will start a war? 
  [Yi] I cannot really say the possibility does not exist, but 
I think the possibility is very slim. North Korea has merely 
conducted test launches of its missiles; they are not yet ready 
for active deployment. With their present military capability, 
they are quite incapable of launching an attack.

  [Text] It is speculated that talks may possibly be held 
between the United states and the DPRK (North Korea) around late 
June on DPRK's suspected nuclear development. Regarding this 
speculation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai indicated 
his negative view at a news conference held on the morning of 15 
June, and said: "Judging from the developments so far and the 
U.S. position, it is difficult to imagine that such talks will 
be held unless DPRK meets the demands of the international 
community."

  [Text] The Japanese Government on 15 June informally 
received a draft resolution the United States plans to submit to 
the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on North Korea for 
its suspected development of nuclear weapons. In response, 
relevant ministries and agencies will begin studying concrete 
ways to put the sanctions into effect. There is a possibility 
the UN Security Council will amend the draft resolution, and the 
task prior to making a final decision on the draft resolution is 
how to persuade China, which is still cautious about imposing 
any sanctions against North Korea, to change its stance. 
  Former U.S. President Carter entered North Korea on 15 June 
and the Japanese Government plans to closely watch how North 
Korean leaders respond to the draft resolution during their 
talks with the former U.S. President, after concluding that 
their response to the draft resolution will affect future 
developments in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  On 15 June, Prime Minister Hata held an emergency meeting 
with government officials at his official residence in the 
evening to discuss how to deal with the draft resolution. The 
Japanese Government has decided to notify the U.S. Government of 
its basic agreement with the draft resolution, but government 
officials are tight-lipped about the draft resolution, saying, 
"We cannot reveal the substance of the draft resolution." A 
government source said, "The draft resolution, as a whole, is 
close to what Japan has asserted." The government source 
stressed that in formulating the draft resolution, the United 
States has accepted, to some extent, what the Japanese 
Government has asserted since Japan, the United States, and 
South Korea held the trilateral talks in Washington on 4 June. 
  After the meeting with the prime minister, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Kumagai said: "Japan has been extremely cautious about 
the sanctions against North Korea. Japan has maintained that 
the sanctions should not simply be a punishment for North Korea, 
but should have the effect of making North Korea return to the 
starting point. I do now know for sure how the draft resolution 
will be handled in the future, but Japan intends to politely 
convey what it thinks to other relevant nations." In this way, 
the government spokesman indicated that Japan would work to 
reflect its assertions in the sanctions through the United 
States and the rest of the permanent members of the UN Security 
Council when the UN Security Council votes on imposing sanctions. 
  The issue of halting remittances by ethnic Koreans residing 
in Japan to North Korea has been a focal point in the sanctions 
against North Korea, but it remains unclear how the issue will 
be dealt with in the future. The issue is believed not to be 
included in the sanctions that will be imposed in accordance 
with the draft resolution, but there is the possibility of the 
issue being incorporated in the sanctions one way or another. 
With regard to the remittances by ethnic Koreans residing in 
Japan to North Korea, they may be excluded from the sanctions. 
A Foreign Ministry source said, "Once the UN Security Council 
votes to adopt a resolution imposing the sanctions against North 
Korea, all nations involved are obliged to comply with the 
sanctions." Thus, he indicated that Japan will not be held 
solely responsible for the remittances. A government source on 
15 June said the Finance Ministry's interpretation is that "it 
is difficult for the government to halt the remittances under 
the current Foreign Exchange Management Law without a UN 
resolution." 
  If the UN Security Council votes to adopt a resolution 
slapping sanctions on North Korea, the government would have no 
trouble halting the remittances. However, if the UN Security 
Council fails to adopt a resolution slapping sanctions on North 
Korea in the face of China's opposition, and multinational 
sanctions are imposed instead, the government would face 
difficulty dealing with the remittances. 
  According to the same government source, the draft 
resolution 
strongly calls on North Korea to return completely to the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and demands the 
imposition of several sanctions against North Korea. 
Specifically, the draft resolution is believed to call for 
suspension of international assistance to the Tumen development 
project, and cultural exchanges. 
  The sanctions envisioned by the draft resolution will have 
no 
great impact on Japan, but they are likely to adversely affect 
developing countries. The government source said "it would not 
be simple" to win support from China and developing countries 
which are members of the UN Security Council. Japan is poised 
to do everything it can do to persuade them in the United 
Nations.

  [Text] Now that the DPRK (North Korea), the country 
suspected of developing nuclear arms, has unilaterally announced 
its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), the Hata government is being compelled to make difficult 
choices in its actions. The government on 14 June was busy 
collecting information and studying actions to take, but with 
the North Korean announcement having come just at the time when 
the UN Security Council was getting ready to discuss the North 
Korean issue, (according to a source in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs) the government is having hard time trying to figure out 
what this "challenging act defying and going against the demand 
of the international community" means. 
  Speaking at the House of Councillors' Budget Committee on 
the 
same day, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata strongly urged North Korea 
to reconsider its decision. Meanwhile, there is a growing mood 
that sanctions would be unavoidable. For instance, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in a telephone conversation with 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa indicated a thinking of taking 
further positive actions against North Korea. 
<H5>  What Is the Real Intention? </H5>
  "The problem is that we do not know their real intention." 
Prime Minister Hata remarked to the press corps in the Diet on 
14 June. The [North Korean] announcement on the withdrawal [from 
the IAEA] made him wonder as it showed that the country was 
withdrawing from the IAEA while remaining a member of the 
Non-Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It was a puzzle because 
under that condition, North Korea would have continued 
obligations to accept nuclear inspections. Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai gave this interpretation, "It showed 
half the body but the other half remains hidden." 
  Interpretations of the government offices [on North Korea's 
action] can be summarized as it representing: 1) retaliation 
against the IAEA for its punitive action to suspend 
technological assistance; and 2) an act of declaring that the 
party with which it will negotiate is the United States before 
UN Security Council starts its debate [on the North Korean 
question] and warning the United States that its next action 
will be withdrawal from the NPT. 
  But still the truth is that the government is unable to 
understand this tough stand of North Korea. Government 
officials emphasize the need for cool response, saying, "We can 
never tell what that country will do. The best thing to do is 
to not make too much fuss over this. North Korea must be happy 
to see its one word has caused uproar in whole of Japan. 
<H5>  Sanctions Unavoidable </H5>
  Whatever the true intention of North Korea may be, the 
dominant view of the government officials is that the impact of 
the North Korean action on the UN Security Council in its debate 
would be unavoidable. Depending on what China, the country 
which is cautious on the issue of sanctions, chooses to do, it 
is possible that the United Nations may not get to pass a 
resolution and, instead, a number of nations will come to agree 
on actions of sanctions without a UN resolution." But the 
Foreign Ministry's view is that of wanting to expedite 
preparations for sanctions in cooperation with other offices 
concerned. A middle-level official of the ministry said, 
"Sanctions will be unavoidable. Things having come this far, it 
is possible that a tough action (a resolution) will be agreed 
to. The resolution may come as early as this week." 
  The Japanese Government in the past has insisted on phased 
actions that would begin with "moderate actions," but according 
to a government source, it "can no longer say such a thing." 
  Prime Minister Hata told the press corps in the Diet on the 
evening of 14 June, "That country has a man called Mr. 
(President) Kim Il-song. Some things cannot be resolved without 
his decision. This matter increasingly is becoming a matter that 
also cannot be resolved without a resolute decision by him." 
Hata appeared to be acutely feeling that the situation is 
getting more serious than before.

<F P=106> [Article by Iwao Ono of YOMIURI SHIMBUN's political desk; </F>
part three of three-part series entitled "North Korea's 
Suspected Development of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure": 
"The United States Is Dubious About Japanese Readiness"] 
  [Text]As tension mounts over the DPRK's suspected nuclear 
arms development program, worries about "Japan becoming an 
ostrich" are spreading among Japanese and U.S.diplomatic circles. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST of the United States last autumn made a 
satirical comment on Japan's indifference to the security 
matters in connection with the North Korean problem: "When 
confronted by danger, a coward ostrich digs its head into the 
sand and pretends not to have seen the danger." With this 
comment in mind, I am concerned whether "Japan's domestic 
readiness is all right," as debates at the UN Security Council 
[UNSC] are now going in earnest. 
  Japanese Foreign Ministry sources consider that it will 
"require some time" before the UNSC comes up with certain 
measures. Toward the end of the current Diet session scheduled 
on 29 June, situations are looming that the head-on clash 
between the ruling and opposition parties over the presentation 
of a no-confidence vote in the cabinet and the last-minute 
decision of the measure in relation to the North Korea problem 
will have to be made at almost the same time. 
  Because of this, not only overseas but also within the 
Japanese Government, there are persistent apprehensions whether 
or not the minority Hata regime is fully prepared to act when 
sanctions against the DPRK are imposed. 
  Prime Minister Hata's North Korean strategy can be 
summarized 
as: first, to make the utmost diplomatic efforts to settle the 
problem peacefully; second, to insist on a gradual enforcement 
of sanctions under a UN resolution, when sanctions become 
inevitable; and third, to commit Japan to independent sanctions 
in concerted efforts of three nations -- Japan, the United 
States, and the ROK -- even devoid of a UN resolution. However, 
it became apparent that the three nations are not necessarily in 
monolithic unity when they met 4 June. 
  Japan's Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign 
Ministry Consolidated Foreign Policy Bureau, made an opening 
proposal to adopt "a resolution of warning before anything 
else." To this, Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of 
state, and Kim Sam-hoon, ROK ambassador for nuclear problems, 
showed strong irritation, saying "such time has already gone," 
and demanded Japan stop remittances from Japan to North Korea, 
quoting the concrete amount to be "500-600 million yen." 
  As a matter of fact, the Japanese Government has completed 
checks on ministry ordinances to make possible an immediate 
response to concrete sanctions, while pursuing dialogue. With 
reference to two precedents of past sanctions on the DPRK and 
the recent one on Iraq, the government finished working out the 
measures, except restriction on the reentry of temporary 
visitors to the DPRK in view of human rights. Foreign Ministry 
sources say: "The present ordinances are sufficient in view of 
the past experience of economic sanctions." 
  For Japan, however, it really needs a just cause -- a UN 
resolution. At the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs 
Committee on 3 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa was asked 
what sort of measures Japan, the United States, and the ROK will 
take if the United Nations failed to adopt the sanctions 
resolution. He indicated Japan's intention of making maximum 
efforts to cooperate and listed stopping remittances to the DPRK 
from Japan and trade between the two countries as concrete 
measures to be taken. At about the same time, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai replied: "It is improper to comment 
when there is a possibility of having a dialogue," when he was 
asked the same question at the House Cabinet Committee. He was 
said to have frowned at hearing the foreign minister's answer: 
"How can he answer like that while I was trying to make it as 
ambiguous as possible." 
  As for stopping remittances, sanctions effectiveness will be 
greatly hampered without a UN resolution, because money can be 
sent through third countries. The Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] is certain to oppose such measures if a UN 
resolution does not come along. With the political situation 
getting more and more fluid, Prime Minister Hata, who wishes 
SDPJ's eventual return to the coalition can hardly decide on the 
North Korean problem that may delicately affect his future plan 
of reshuffling the cabinet. 
  The Japanese Government has not made its position clear on 
the matter of logistic support, such as fuel supply, of U.S. 
Navy ships on the sea blockade mission to insure the 
effectiveness of sanctions, because it foresees an inevitable 
controversy over the constitutionality of the rights to 
collective self-defense. Comments are being made about the 
possible amendments to the Self Defense Forces and Commodities 
Control Laws, but Defense Agency sources see the situation as: 
"The hurdle to be cleared is high and the political situation 
does not attest to entering into debates on the subject." 
  The 7 June HERALD-TRIBUNE of the United States made a severe 
comment on that matter: "The Hata cabinet's vulnerability makes 
us dubious about Japanese cooperation to make the sanctions 
effective. The Hata regime has its hands full of domestic 
problems." Despite debates based on the past experience of 
ministries that imposed sanctions, it is doubtful if a unified 
cabinet program can be worked out. 
  The crisis management over the neighboring Korean peninsula 
carries incomparably heavier weight than that during the Gulf 
War days. Though a minority government leader, Prime Minister 
Hata cannot escape from reality.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 16 Jun Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] One of the sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) 
for its suspected nuclear arms development is to suspend 
remittance. Concerning this measure, a government source stated 
on the evening of 15 June: "According to the Finance Ministry, 
it will be difficult to take this measures without a UN 
resolution. In saying it is difficult, the ministry means such 
a measure cannot be taken." 
  It is speculated that in the Foreign Exchange and Foreign 
Trade Control Law that restrictions can be imposed on payment 
"for the purpose of faithfully fulfilling international treaties 
that our country has concluded or other international 
commitments." According to the same source, the judgment seems 
to indicate that a UN resolution can be taken as an 
"international commitment" but this regulation cannot be applied 
to "multilateral-type" sanctions.

  [Text] With the DPRK (North Korea) having announced its 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
the question of imposing sanctions against that country has 
entered a critical stage. However, the sanctions are not 
expected to affect Japanese industry much because the scale of 
Japan's trade with North Korea is small while travel between 
these two nations is close to nonexistent. 
<H5>  Trade </H5>
  Japan-DPRK trade ran to about 100 billion yen a year from 
the 
late seventies and early eighties. During that period, Japan's 
exports to North Korea continuously exceeded its imports by a 
ratio of almost 2:1. But since North Korea announced a policy 
to balance imports and exports in 1986, Japan's exports to the 
country decreased by half [the next year] and Japan has imported 
more than it has exported since 1987. Overall trade came down 
to a 50-60 billion yen level. 
  Japan's main exports to North Korea used to be manufactured 
products, like machinery. But since 1992, textile products, 
such as woolen fabrics, and automobiles have been its major 
export items. As for imports from North Korea, nonferrous metals 
used to be major products, but recently men's suits and coats, 
mushrooms, and anthracite coal have come to be major items. 
<H5>  Aviation and Traveling </H5>
  There are no regular airline services between Japan and 
North 
Korea. Only chartered planes operate from Nagoya and Niigata 
Airports. Mushrooms are the major air-freighted product from 
North Korea, and personnel exchanges are limited to special 
delegations. In case sanctions are taken, all of these airline 
operations will be suspended. 
  As for surface shipping, even the Transport Ministry does 
not 
know accurate conditions. However, it is estimated that about 
100 North Korean ships enter Japan every year. With 
instructions from the Foreign Affairs Ministry or the Defence 
Agency, the Maritime Safety Agency can conduct on-the-spot 
inspections on these ships entering Japan by sending patrol 
boats, but it is still uncertain how far the agency can go in 
restricting entry of North Korean ships as part of economic 
sanctions. 
<H5>  Reaction From Business Circles </H5>
  Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Federation of 
Economic Organizations [Keidanren], at a 13 June news 
conference, commented: "This [DPRK issue] is an important 
security issue for Japan, and we must take it seriously. I hope 
that, if possible, North Korea will soon revert to a position 
that can be accepted by the international community so that 
sanctions will be avoided." Minoru Makihara, president of 
Mitsubishi Corporation, said: "I think Japan can make moves on 
its own more actively in close contact with the Untied States. 
Although the sanctions' impact on Japan's economy will be 
small, this is a problem that is taking place in Asia. How will 
the government deal with it if the United States decides to wash 
its hands of this matter?"

  [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue, which has grown 
increasingly tense following North Korea's announcement of its 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
has caused a subtle ripple in the confused political situation 
in Japan. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]; Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister; and Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, former chairman of 
the Policy Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], who are all proponents of a 
"conservative-conservative coalition," are pushing for a 
realignment of established political parties on the basis of a 
policy consensus. They are citing the North Korean nuclear 
issue as one important policy that needs a consensus. With the 
current Diet session set to close on 29 June, the North Korean 
nuclear issue may become not only an important diplomatic task 
for Japan, but one factor in unsettling the political situation. 
  As far as the North Korean nuclear issue is concerned, the 
government's position is: "There is no option for Japan but to 
sincerely carry out what the United Nations decides" (said a 
senior Foreign Ministry official). Some government officials 
are voicing concern over Japan's overreaction to North Korea's 
withdrawal from the IAEA, saying: "What is important is that 
our nation must refrain from making a big fuss. North Korea 
would be pleased to find its simple announcements or comments 
trigging a big fuss in Japan" (said a government source). 
  The North Korean nuclear crisis was a hot issue in the 
Hosokawa government, the handling of which the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] bitterly disputed with Shinseito and 
Komeito. The SDPJ may become a hurdle for proponents of the 
"conservative- conservative coalition" who intend to seek a 
coalition by "putting aside past grudges." 
  While the United Nations is certain to begin a full-fledged 
debate on sanctions against North Korea, China is still taking a 
wary position. The prevailing view is that serious domestic 
debates will be held in "the far future" on how Japan should 
actually deal with sanctions (said a Foreign Ministry source). 
In the closing days of the current Diet session, the political 
situation is expected to be strained over a no-confidence motion 
against the Hata cabinet, and the handling of a bill on the 
demarcation for a new single-seat constituency system and a new 
proportional representation system; no drastic developments are 
expected to occur before the current Diet session closes. 
  North Korea has made it clear it wants to negotiate only 
with 
the United States. Japanese Government officials are concerned 
that the "North Korean nuclear issue could become a factor in 
destabilizing the political situation in Japan" because the 
issue is bound to strain things (said a senior Foreign Ministry 
official).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The DPRK's Withdrawal From the IAEA Will Not </F>
Bring a Solution to the Nuclear Issue"] 
  [Text] On 13 June, North Korea announced its decision to 
immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). 
  Although the act was meant to oppose an IAEA resolution to 
freeze technical aid to the country, it runs counter to the 
international community's hope for nuclear nonproliferation. 
Thus, it is very regrettable. 
  It is unclear whether this is Pyongyang's final attitude 
toward the problem of the country's suspected nuclear weapons 
development. But its withdrawal from the IAEA will not bring a 
solution to the issue. We again call for the country to hear 
the opinion of the international community. 
  Prior to Pyongyang's announcement, Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa visited South Korea and China to discuss the 
DPRK's suspected nuclear program with his counterparts. 
  In Japan-ROK talks, the two countries agreed that the time 
has come for the UN Security Council [UNSC] to take appropriate 
measures, including economic sanctions, and that such measures 
should be aimed at encouraging North Korea to change its 
attitude. 
  Meanwhile, in Japan-PRC foreign ministerial talks, China 
questioned the effectiveness of sanctions and stressed the need 
to resolve the issue through dialogue. 
  In this sense, China has not changed its cautious approach 
toward imposing sanctions. However, considering the fact that 
the PRC did not express clear opposition to sanctions, and that 
it abstained from a vote on the IAEA resolution calling for the 
freeze of technical aid to the DPRK, it can be said Beijing has 
indicated some flexibility in dealing with the issue. 
  In talks with the United States, Japan has asserted 
implementing phased sanctions. It said the United Nations 
should first adopt a "resolution of warning," and then it should 
lay an embargo on the export of weapons and suspend technical 
aid to the DPRK, and finally it should implement all-out 
sanctions, including the suspension of remittances to the 
country. 
  Some U.S. newspapers reported the Japanese assertion, 
commenting: "Japan is reluctant to carry out economic sanctions 
against North Korea." The Japanese Embassy at Washington 
strongly rebutted it, saying: "The report is inaccurate." 
  In a series of talks, Foreign Minister Kakizawa reiterated 
Japan's position that although it strongly hopes for resolving 
the issue through dialogue, "Japan will take responsive measures 
within the limits of the Constitution if the UNSC makes a 
decision." 
  Japan has taken a position against nuclear proliferation. 
Thus, if the DPRK promotes nuclear development, it will affect 
the basis of Japan's security policy. 
  Japan, the United States, and the ROK should not be in 
disarray over a basic policy toward the DPRK. Otherwise, 
Pyongyang will continue to take a hard-line attitude. 
  It is very regrettable that when the nuclear issue has 
entered a serious situation, Japan has made no in-depth 
discussions on the matter. 
  The government has failed to discuss fully the nuclear issue 
because of opposition parties' attempt to nail cabinet ministers 
down with a slip of tongue to urge them to step down. At the 
same time, the government has avoided discussions on detailed 
measures to deal with the issue. This is problematic. 
  At a 13 June House of Councillors' Budget Committee session, 
officials of concerned ministries and agencies were asked about 
the issue of imposing sanctions on the DPRK. Without exception, 
they all answered: "We are studying measures, but we cannot 
disclose them." If the government continues to take such an 
attitude, there will be no progress in discussions on the 
nuclear issue. It will also remain unclear what the "within the 
limits of the Constitution" means. 
  Senior officials of both ruling and opposition parties are 
concerned about what will happen after the budget bill is 
enacted. They are only arguing whether they should submit a 
motion of no confidence against the cabinet or the cabinet 
should resign en masse. Such an attitude is tantamount to the 
evasion of responsibility to be assumed as people's 
representatives and will endanger the nation's future.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What is North Korea Thinking Of?"] </F>
  [Text] North Korea, which is suspected of developing 
nuclear weapons, announced that it will immediately withdraw 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and issued a 
statement rejecting all nuclear inspections. These actions will 
deepen suspicions about North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development and heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. The 
situation has worsened to the point where we have to really 
worry. 
  North Korea has completed the removal of all the fuel rods 
from a five-megawatt experimental atomic reactor in defiance of 
the IAEA's demand for halting the action. In reaction, the IAEA 
has voted to adopt a resolution imposing "sanctions" against 
North Korea that include suspending technological cooperation. 
North Korea has reacted to the IAEA's sanctions by announcing 
its withdrawal from the IAEA. North Korea's reaction was beyond 
our anticipation. 
  Meanwhile, North Korean President Kim Il-song recently told 
an American expert: "If issues, including normalizing relations 
between North Korea and the United States, are settled as a 
package deal and the United States provides us with assistance 
in our effort to shift to light-water atomic reactors, we will 
be willing to freeze our nuclear program." 
  If North Korea quits the IAEA, it will obviously become 
impossible for both the United States and North Korea to hold 
dialogue and spur debates on a resolution in the UN Security 
Council on imposing sanctions against North Korea. We would 
like to ask North Korea: "What on Earth are you thinking of?." 
  We would like to focus on two points of North Korea's recent 
statement. 
  First, North Korea has announced that it will quit the IAEA, 
but it has not expressed its intention to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  North Korea joined the NPT in 1985 and signed a safeguards 
agreement with the IAEA in 1992 to accept nuclear inspections. 
In March 1993, however, North Korea rejected an IAEA demand for 
special nuclear inspections of two undeclared nuclear facilities 
in Yongbyon and then announced that it would quit the NPT. 
Later, following talks with the United States, North Korea 
expressed its intention to temporarily suspend its withdrawal 
from the NPT. Since then, North Korea has taken the stand that 
it accepts only bona-fide nuclear inspections while maintaining 
that it holds a "special status" while it delays withdrawal from 
the NPT. 
  If North Korea quits the IAEA and rejects all nuclear 
inspections, this means it remains in the NPT without having 
nuclear inspections. This is a flagrant violation of the NPT. 
The "special status" theory, which North Korea has expounded, 
is no longer convincing. 
  Second, North Korea's rejection of all nuclear inspections 
would make it impossible to determine whether or not it has 
developed nuclear weapons in the past or has diverted plutonium 
extracted from fuel rods to nuclear weapons development. North 
Korea's rejection of all nuclear inspections would also make it 
impossible to check that country's nuclear program in the 
"future." 
  How should the international community deal with North 
Korea's dangerous actions? 
  What is important is that the international community should 
deal coolly with the North Korean nuclear issue and take a 
resolute attitude without overreacting to any of North Korea's 
actions. 
  To that end, the international community needs to find out 
what North Korea's real intentions are, and sensibly monitor 
North Korean signals. Former U.S. President Carter will be 
visiting North Korea. Liberal Democratic Party members will also 
be visiting Pyongyang following a visit by Social Democratic 
Party of Japan members. They will have a good opportunity to 
feel out their real intentions. 
  Since North Korea wants to resolve the nuclear issue through 
dialogue with the United States, the United States should not 
close the channel for dialogue. It is important for the United 
States to cooperate with the UN Security Council and other 
nations. 
  The role to be played by China, North Korea's most friendly 
ally, is increasingly growing important. During his meeting 
with Choe Kwang, visiting General Staff chief of the Korean 
People's Army, Chinese President Jiang Zemin stressed the 
inseparability of China and North Korea, describing Sino-North 
Korean relations as "teeth and lips." North Korea cannot 
maintain itself for a long period without China's supplies of 
oil and spare parts for weapons. 
  China has frequently advocated "peace and stability" on the 
Korean peninsula and the "denuclearization" of the Korean 
peninsula. North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA may jeopardize 
this. We hope that China will seriously persuade North Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by political reporter Yasunori Matsuno: "Different </F>
Appraisals of Kakizawa's Visit to China"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa recently visited 
South Korea and China to discuss measures to deal with North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. However, his 
first trip abroad since becoming the foreign minister has been 
assessed variously. A negative appraisal has been given to the 
result that his visit clarified differences between Japan, the 
U.S.-ROK group, and China in their stands toward a UN resolution 
calling for imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK. 
Meanwhile, the fact that his visit enabled people to understand 
somewhat why China is negative about sanctions has been assessed 
positively. 
  In a series of talks, Kakizawa stressed the importance of 
resolving the DPRK nuclear issue "through dialogue." He also 
indicated that the study of "measures, including sanctions" at 
the UN Security Council would back up efforts for a peaceful 
solution to the problem. 
  During talks with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Tarnoff, 
Seoul stressed that "UN-led economic sanctions are necessary." 
But in talks with Kakizawa held at a later date, it supported 
the idea of "the United Nations taking gradual steps," such as 
adopting a resolution of warning, instead of immediately 
imposing sanctions. 
  As such, South Korea took different attitude toward the DPRK 
issue in talks with Japan than it took in talks with the United 
States. This seems to be because Seoul gave consideration to 
the Hata cabinet, which is persuading the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan to return to the ruling coalition, and it thought 
it was not good to press Kakizawa hard over the sanctions issue 
prior to his visit to China, which is negative about sanctions. 
  In China, Kakizawa asked Beijing to "actively participate in 
studying sanctions at the United Nations." "He thus tried to 
have China join in positive discussions on measures to deal with 
North Korea, including economic sanctions," (according to a 
senior Foreign Ministry official). However, Beijing did not 
change its negative stand toward sanctions. 
  Through a series of talks, "it became clear that there is a 
difference of policy toward the DPRK in the U.S.-ROK group, 
which thinks economic sanctions to be inevitable; China, which 
is negative about sanctions; and Japan, which stands in between. 
Kakizawa's visits have brought about this bad result," 
according to a diplomatic source in China. 
  On the other hand, Kakizawa's talks with Beijing clarified 
that China questions the effectiveness of economic sanctions and 
is opposed to UN-led sanctions, although the nation considers 
the current situation surrounding the DPRK nuclear issue as 
serious, noting, "It is a difficult, worrisome situation." A 
source, who accompanied Kakizawa on his trip, evaluates this 
result highly, saying: "We now know China is still undecided. 
This gives us a hint as to how we should approach the PRC." 
  It is said that "moves by Japan, which stands in between the 
U.S.-ROK group and China, will become more and more important" 
in dealing with the nuclear issue, (according to a Foreign 
Ministry source). If the United Nations adopts a resolution 
calling for sanctions, the situation will become more serious. 
How should Japan cope with such a situation? "Kakizawa 
diplomacy will likely face a crucial moment at the time," 
(according to the same source).

  [Text] The government will submit an additional request as 
early as this week to China, which wants to become a GATT 
member this year, asking it to lower tariffs on about 300 mining 
and manufacturing industrial goods, including chemical and 
electric appliances. Japan has already asked China to lower 
tariffs and remove nontariff barriers on some 3,800 goods. The 
total number of goods, if the items on the additional request 
are included, will become about 4,100. 
  Regarding the 3,800 goods, the government submitted a demand 
last March and received a tentative answer from China in late 
May. However, since the contents of the response are not 
"satisfactory," (according to a government source), the 
government, in addition to submitting the additional request, 
plans to work on China during future bilateral negotiations to 
positively accept the demands. 
  Regarding China's GATT membership, a GATT working-level 
meeting is scheduled to be held in Geneva starting on 27 June. 
It seems that Japan and China will have bilateral negotiations 
at that time.

  [Text] Capetown, 14 Jun -- South African Trade Minister 
Tleber Manuel [name as published] granted an interview to a 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Capetown. During the 
interview, the minister indicated an intention to visit Japan 
this year to hold talks with Japanese leaders on measures to 
increase trade with Japan and Japanese investment in the 
country, following similar talks with the United States and the 
European Union (EU). He stated that, in addition to investment 
in resources-related industries, South Africa hopes that direct 
foreign investment will lead to an improvement of the social 
infrastructure in such areas as housing construction, 
electrification, and water supply as well as in tourism, to 
which the Mandela administration is attaching importance. 
  Both the United States and the EU have moved toward closer 
trade relations with South Africa. For example, they have 
decided to apply general preferential duties to the country, 
which has put an end to its apartheid policy following a 
constituent parliamentary election in April. In showing 
interest in consultations with Japan, the trade minister stated: 
"Japan has been positively investing in foreign nations, and it 
has enjoyed trade surpluses." He expressed hope that Japan will 
help revitalize the South African economy by promoting both 
investment and trade.

  [Text] The "Kayu-Kai," which consists of senior leaders of 
various factions of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], held a 
meeting at the party headquarters on the afternoon of 14 June to 
exchange views on measures to deal with the current political 
situation. Among the participants were Seiroku Kajiyam, former 
party general secretary, and Koko Sato, former chairman of the 
party policy affairs research council. As a result, they 
reached a consensus that the party should insist on submitting a 
motion of no-confidence in the cabinet following the passage of 
the draft budget for fiscal 1994. They confirmed the plan to 
support the party executives under President Yosuke Kono, who 
plan to submit the no- confidence motion. After the meeting, 
Sato and other leaders met with President Kono to convey their 
views. 
  Participants in the meeting stated one after another their 
views against the Hata cabinet. For example, one participant 
said: "The Hata cabinet is a minority administration endorsed by 
the fewest Dietmen ever. Therefore, the cabinet deserves a 
no-confidence motion."

  [Text] While ruling and opposition parties waged their 
political battle -- over such issues as a possible no-confidence 
motion against the Hata Cabinet -- with the current Diet session 
set to close 29 June, ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a survey by 
interview of all House of Representatives members to hear their 
views on questions like the dissolution of the House for a 
general election and the no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet. 
  On the focal issue of a no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet, the survey results that reflected the current chaotic 
political situation. While almost equal numbers of Diet members 
supported and opposed the motion, over 20 percent said they 
still cannot decide their position on it. 
  Asked what the Hata Cabinet should do after the 1994 budget 
is approved, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito members 
insisted that a next general election should be held only under 
the new electoral district system. But nearly 60 percent of 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] members said that either the House of 
Representative should be dissolved for an election under the 
current medium electoral district system or the Hata Cabinet 
should resign en masse. 
  The interview results showed that the members' opinions were 
also divided over the question of future political realignment. 
For example, while a majority of SDPJ members favored a 
tripolar political system, nearly 90 percent of Shinseito and 
Komeito members were in favor of a two-party system. 
  When asked what the Hata Cabinet should do after the passage 
of the budget, which is expected to take place around 24 June, 
15 percent of the Diet members said: "The House of 
Representatives must be immediately dissolved. We have no 
choice but to hold an election under the current system." 
Twenty-three percent said: "The election should be conducted 
under the new system." Moreover, 21 percent of Diet members, 
mostly from Shinseito and Komeito, said that while the next 
election should be conducted under the new system, "the house 
should not be dissolved before the end of this year," in view of 
the fact that the government faces so many tasks at home and 
abroad and that the "non-LDP" camp is not prepared for the next 
election. In addition, 29 percent of respondents, mostly from 
the LDP and SDPJ, gave "other opinions," most of which were 
those seeking the cabinet's resignation. 
  Broken down by the political parties, in the LDP, 40 percent 
-- the largest proportion -- gave "other opinions"; 19 percent 
favored "an election under the current system"; while 23 
percent, mostly the advocates of the new system within the 
party, favored "an election under the new system." In the SDPJ, 
26 percent supported "an election under the current system," 24 
percent favored "an election under the new system," and 30 
percent gave "other opinions." The results show views in these 
two parties are diverse. 
  Asked "what will you do if a no-confidence motion on the 
cabinet is presented," the number who said they would support or 
oppose it was almost the same. Among those who gave "other 
opinions," most were of the view that they will have to wait and 
see. For example, former SDPJ Chairman Sadao Yamahana said: 
"Our stand on the motion will be decided depending on who will 
submit the motion and for what reason." As such, it appears 
likely that whether the no-confidence motion will pass or not 
will come to depend on how this group of people will move. 
  Asked about the way the next coalition government should be 
formed in case the Hata Cabinet resigns, Diet members responded 
in diverse manners. A little less than 20 percent said it 
should be "a coalition with the SDPJ back," "a government led by 
the current coalition with part of the LDP and the SDPJ 
participating," or "a caretaker government." Almost 10 percent 
said it should be "an LDP-led government" or "a coalition 
comprised of the LDP, the SDPJ, and Sakigake." 
  About 60 percent of the Diet members of Shinseito and 
Komeito 
wanted it to be "a continuation of the current coalition with 
part of the LDP and SDPJ added to it," indicating their strong 
desire to only "reorganize" the current coalition. Nearly half 
of the SDPJ members said they wanted the SDPJ to return to the 
coalition. The LDP members naturally wanted to control the new 
government. Some of them also replied in favor of "a 
conservative and moderate government led by the LDP" and "an 
alliance of conservatives led by the LDP and Shinseito."

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii by </F>
unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place, date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the ruling and 
opposition parties can agree on tax reform? 
  [Fujii] I have read a newspapers' serial interviews with 
party officials in charge of tax affairs, and realized most of 
us stand on common ground. In the aging society, we cannot 
excessively depend on certain social levels. Although each 
party has its own opinion on methodology of tax reform, all 
parties have the same goal. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] is calling 
for tax increase according to an estimate mechanically 
calculated, and many people are criticizing such a businesslike 
way. 
  [Fujii] Frankly speaking, I wanted to carefully deal with 
the subject. However, it is hard to promote tax reform debates 
without some quantitative guidelines. We have no specific 
intention in the policy. 
  We have to constantly work on administrative reform. The MOF 
plans to comprehensively review structure and manpower needs of 
92 subsidiary organizations. Regarding unfair taxation, it is 
about time to reconsider consumption tax exemption for smaller 
businesses. 
  Taxes on interest should be imposed on all bank accounts 
held 
by individuals, and we think the taxpayer number system may be 
introduced when the reformed pension system gives a number to 
each individual. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion of proposals for 
consumption tax reduction for certain commodities? 
  [Fujii] Some foreign countries indeed have lightened sales 
taxes on foodstuff, but most of them do so because the regular 
sales tax rates are over 10 percent. Also, I think it is 
difficult to determine the realm of tax reduction items. I 
think (the introduction of a lightened tax) is questionable. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think a tax increase for welfare 
expenditures should be determined now in package with an income 
tax cut? 
  [Fujii] While the combination of the income tax cut and the 
consumption tax hike is called a net tax hike, I am not sure if 
that is an appropriate expression. But, that is the 
government's position. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your stance on local government 
bodies' requests to share an increased consumption tax? 
  [Fujii] Many welfare policies are carried on at the local 
level, and local government bodies need stable revenue resources 
for that. But that can be widely covered by various existing 
systems. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you give some examples? 
  [Fujii] Reinforcement of local allocation taxes and transfer 
taxes may be a possible measure. Those systems probably do not 
look fresh, but can be effective. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does the government intend to indicate the 
rate of the consumption tax increase in its tax reform plan to 
be announced in the end of June? 
  [Fujii] As a minority government, we must carefully listen 
to opinions of coalition members, the opposition, and the 
public. But the MOF itself wants to incorporate the tax rate in 
the plan. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Some say all the tax reform plan should 
have is a decision to continue income tax cut. 
  [Fujii] In that case, we would have to issue 
deficit-covering bonds with no brake. We must have a permanent 
revenue and fundamental tax system reform to secure the income 
tax cut.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Foreign-made semiconductor 
chips captured more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in 
the January-March period, according to both Japanese and U.S. 
calculations, the Trade Ministry said Tuesday [14 June]. 
  The foreign share for the reporting quarter came to 22.0 
percent under a Japanese formula, a marginal drop from 22.1 
percent in the fourth quarter of 1993, while the same share 
under a U.S. method stood unchanged at 20.7 percent. 
  The foreign chip share for the year's first quarter remained 
nearly identical to that in the preceding quarter, a clear 
contrast from the downtrend seen in the first quarter of past 
years, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) said. A 1991 bilateral chip trade accord calls 
for Japan to maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the 
foreign share above the 20 percent level. 
  Both domestic chip consumption and foreign chip sales in 
Japan declined in the January-March period from the preceding 
quarter in terms of value. However, the pace of the fall for 
both figures, which are not available according to mutual 
agreement, was smaller in the latest quarter than in previous 
years, the official said. "The latest statistics signal that the 
penetration of foreign chips in the Japanese market has been on 
the rise," the MITI official said. 
  Tori Sato, incoming chairman of the Electronic Industries 
Association of Japan's Users' Committee of Foreign 
Semiconductors, said in a statement that "the fact that the 
foreign share remained close to the level attained in the fourth 
quarter of 1993 indicated that both sides continue to make 
progress in promoting access to the Japanese semiconductor 
market." "We encourage foreign products to continue to work 
with us in promoting greater cooperation between industries, so 
that everyone will be able to prosper in the Japanese market," 
said Sato, also executive vice president of Hitachi Ltd. 
  In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said 
in a statement, "the U.S. is pleased to see a market share of 
over 20 percent has been maintained for two quarters in a row." 
"The latest reading is extremely important for the fate of the 
ongoing Japan-U.S. trade framework talks," he said. 
  The 1991 chip accord incorporates two different methods for 
calculating the foreign share in Japan. The U.S. counts only on 
the sales of foreign chips in the open market. The Japanese 
formula allows a broader measurement that includes so-called 
"captive" sales of U.S. companies to their Japanese subsidiaries 
and those by Japanese companies under foreign brand names. 
  Based on the latest calculation, Japan and the U.S. will 
hold 
chip trade talks in Tokyo on Wednesday and Thursday. The 
meeting will focus on reviewing implementation of steps agreed 
on during the Hawaii talks in March this year, including the 
"design-in" cooperation program for making semiconductors from 
the development stage, the MITI official said.

<F P=106> [By Siti Rahil] </F>
  [Text] Singapore, June 15 KYODO -- The United States has 
formally informed Japan it opposes the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) plan for an East Asian Economic Caucus 
(EAEC), official Japanese and ASEAN sources said Wednesday [15 
June]. 
  The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo conveyed Washington's opposition 
to 
the EAEC proposal to the Japanese Government June 7, saying the 
caucus would have a negative effect on the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  It marks the first time that the administration of President 
Bill Clinton, which has taken a wait-and-see attitude on the 
EAEC, has explicitly opposed the proposal. 
  The embassy also told Japanese officials that Thailand, 
which 
is the current chairman of ASEAN, and Brunei, as the ASEAN 
chairman of the U.S.-ASEAN dialogue this year, will be informed 
about Washington's stance. 
  The declaration of U.S. opposition to the caucus comes soon 
after ASEAN officials briefed the U.S. Government during the 
u.S.-ASEAN dialogue meeting in Washington in may on the details 
of the EAEC as formulated by ASEAN in a blueprint on the EAEC 
concept. 
  According to the blueprint, the EAEC is not "a subsidiary 
organ of APEC but would function independently of it." 
  It points out that even though ASEAN agreed last year that 
the EAEC would function as a caucus within APEC, it is not a 
caucus "of" APEC. 
  The blueprint also says "the caucus would determine its own 
agenda" and "the results of the caucus' discussions need not be 
reported to APEC meetings unless deemed necessary." 
  At the Washington meeting, ASEAN officials assured the U.S. 
Government that the EAEC would not be confrontational and would 
be compatible with the U.S.-favored APEC forum. U.S. Assistant 
Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord did not 
give a response at the time. 
  The administration of former President George Bush had 
bitterly opposed the plan for the EAEC, which would exclude the 
U.S. because of worries that it would become a confrontational 
economic weapon of Asian economies against the developed world. 
But the Clinton administration initially appeared to move 
toward a softer stance. 
  Washington's latest opposition makes it more difficult for 
Japan to accept ASEAN's invitation to join the EAEC. So far, 
Japan has remained cool toward the issue because of fear of 
antagonizing the U.S. 
  The absence of Japan, Asia's economic powerhouse, from the 
EAEC would put the proposal in a quandary and analysts say ASEAN 
may now have no choice but to make further changes to the EAEC 
concept.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- About 250 representatives 
of Japanese and foreign automakers and dealers attended a 
seminar held in Tokyo Tuesday [14 June] to help promote sales of 
cars imported from the United States. 
  The Japan Automobile Dealers Association, which sponsored 
the 
session, told those attending that the number of Japanese 
dealers selling imported cars has increased because they are not 
barred by affiliated makers from selling products of other 
manufacturers. The association said the number of such dealers 
will continue to increase if imported cars are competitive in 
quality and price. 
  Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Motor Co. (Japan) Ltd., and 
other representatives of the Big Three U.S. automakers explained 
their marketing strategies in Japan. 
  The seminar was organized by the association to help promote 
Japan-U.S. negotiations for a new framework of bilateral trade. 
The association said it plans to hold a similar seminar for 
cars imported from Europe.

  [Text] Washington, June 16 KYODO -- Okinawa Prefecture 
urged the United States to curtail its bases in southernmost 
Japan in a full-page WASHINGTON POST advertisement Thursday [16 
June], saying aircraft noise and shooting drills are hurting the 
residents' living conditions and the environment. 
  The ad is timed with Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota's visit 
to 
the U.S., starting Thursday, to press the White House and the 
Pentagon on the issue. Ota said in the ad that his past two 
visits to the U.S. to seek a solution to the problems failed to 
produce any concrete results. 
  Ota is scheduled to meet commanding officers of the 
Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Fleet. In Washington he will hold 
talks with State Department and Pentagon officials as well as 
with members of the Senate and House of Representatives Armed 
Services Committees. 
  Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are 
concentrated in Okinawa, comprising a cluster of islands 
northeast of Taiwan. The ad calls for the return of the U.S. 
naval port in Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and 
live-ammunition exercises. 
  Okinawa was reunited with Japan on May 15, 1972 after a 
27-year occupation, under the condition that U.S. Forces would 
be allowed to continue to use the bases there.

  [Text] Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, 
in a 15 June interview with NHK, declined to directly comment on 
the draft sanctions resolution that the United States has 
prepared to submit to the UN Security Council [UNSC], merely 
saying: China's position remains unchanged. The PRC has 
maintained a cautious stance on imposing sanctions against the 
DPRK. 
  As a result, it is expected that for the time being, 
behind-the-scenes maneuverings -- including possible revisions 
to the draft resolution -- will continue among UNSC member 
nations, with attention focused on how China will react to the 
U.S. proposal.

  [Text] Niigata, June 15 KYODO -- International economic 
sanctions against North Korea would result in mass starvation in 
the country, a semiofficial research institute said Wednesday 
[15 June]. 
  The Economic Research Institute for North-East Asia, 
partially financed by the Niigata prefectural and municipal 
governments, argued that many of the 23 million North Koreans 
will not be able to keep themselves alive if serious sanctions 
take effect. 
  Tension over the country's suspected nuclear arms 
development 
program heightened further Monday when North Korea declared it 
would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear safeguard watchdog. 
  The move drastically raised the prospect of early UN 
sanctions against Pyongyang, or U.S.-coordinated sanctions along 
with such countries as Japan and South Korea if there is no 
agreement within the UN Security Council. 
  The institute, headed by economist Hisao Kanamori, said many 
North Koreans are already living on the verge of hunger due to 
an extreme dearth of food supplies. 
  Based on released statistics, the institute said food 
supplies in the country, although on a steady decline, should 
still be enough to provide a daily average of 2,000 kilocalories 
per person, an amount sufficient for North Koreans to do 
everyday work. 
  But the figure is deplorable for the ordinary citizen 
because 
of the priority given in food supplies to government bureaucrats 
and military officials. 
  Also distorting the statistics is the fact that feed for 
animals is included. 
  The institute has estimated that an average citizen receives 
a meager 1,400 kilocalories of food every day, an amount that 
makes active labor quite hard. 
  "We have made an estimation on the living conditions of 
North 
Koreans for which little information is available. We hope it 
will serve as material for discussions on sanctions," said 
Makoto Nobukuni, chief economist at the institute.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] will urge 
Japan, the United States and China to make efforts to reopen 
high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, a party official 
said Thursday [16 June]. 
  Kazo Watanabe, director of the second largest opposition 
party's General Affairs Bureau, told a news conference at the 
Japan National Press Club that Japan and North Korea should also 
resume talks as early as possible to establish diplomatic 
relations. Officials of the (North) Korean Workers' Party have 
told SDP officials in Pyongyang they want to unconditionally 
restart normalization talks stalled since November 1992, 
Watanabe said. 
  An SDP delegation headed by Watanabe visited North Korea for 
six days up to Wednesday as part of efforts to promote ties with 
the North's ruling party. The SDP has traditionally maintained 
close relations with the Korean Workers' Party. 
  Watanabe also said the SDP will oppose the idea of slapping 
sanctions on North Korea as a means of ending Pyongyang's 
alleged quest for nuclear weapons. 
  Two legislators of the primary opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party are also visiting Pyongyang for talks on North Korea's 
nuclear program.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan's overall merchandise 
trade surplus fell back sharply in may after five straight gains 
with imports soaring both in value and volume on the yen's rise, 
the Finance Ministry said Thursday [16 June]. The politically 
sensitive surplus with the United States, however, continued to 
rise. 
  The overall customs-cleared trade surplus fell an unadjusted 
15.9 percent to 6.54 billion dollars, scoring a double-digit 
fall for the first time since December 1991, the ministry said 
in a preliminary report. Imports rose 12.3 percent to 21.54 
billion dollars, and exports gained 4.2 percent to 28.07 billion 
dollars. 
  A ministry official, briefing reporters, said import volume 
rose sharply on the yen's rise, citing the 16.1 point rise in 
the trade index for import volume. 
  Regarding the effect of the yen's rise on exports, he said 
the index for export volume fell 2.5 points to post the fourth 
straight decline, but the price index was at 7.0 points to 
inflate the export value. 
  In yen terms, the trade surplus fell 21.6 percent to mark 
the 
fourth consecutive decline, with exports falling 3.0 percent and 
imports rising 4.5 percent. 
  The dollar averaged 103.17 yen in the latest reporting 
month, down 7.4 percent from 110.85 yen the preceding year. 
  The official noted a special factor involving the "Golden 
Week" holidays in early May that were longer than in the 
previous year. Companies increased their exports in late April 
ahead of the holidays to prevent any gaps in covering foreign 
orders. But he said this alone would not lead to such sharp 
declines in the overall surplus. 
  Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, 
cited a lot of information indicated in May. The May figures 
are insufficient to judge that the overall trade gap turned 
firmly lower due to holiday factors, he said. "But we must take 
note of the increases in import volume," Takagi said, adding 
that imports are increasing despite ongoing sluggish domestic 
demand, and that Japanese manufacturers are indeed facing tough 
price competition from cheaper imports in the unchanged market 
pie. Meanwhile, the surplus with the U.S. remained higher in 
reflecting lingering trade disputes, he said, adding that the 
dollar is unlikely to fall against the yen against this 
backdrop. Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. rose 7.5 percent 
from a year earlier to 3.04 billion dollars, the third 
consecutive monthly gain, the ministry said. 
  As for other major nations, the surplus with the European 
union fell 31.5 percent to 1.34 billion dollars for the fifth 
straight decline, and the surplus with other Asian nations edged 
0.5 percent lower to 4.03 billion dollars after rising for 24 
straight months. 
  Takagi traced the lower surplus with Asia to increased 
imports of cheaper products, led by clothing from China, that 
more than offset a relatively healthy increase in exports. In 
fact, imports of clothing posted a strong rise in May, gaining 
26.9 percent from the previous year. 
  Among other major import gainers were office equipment, up 
46.9 percent, and semiconductor and other electronics parts, up 
39.2 percent. Imports for crude oil fell 14.8 percent although 
the import volume rose 4.6 percent, stemming from lower prices 
that averaged 15.39 dollars, down 18.5 percent from 18.88 
dollars. 
  As for major export gainers, semiconductor and other 
electronics parts rose 30.2 percent, and engines and motors 
increased 21.9 percent. Exports for audiovisual equipment fell 
22.3 percent, and those for automobiles dropped 11.7 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan's trade surplus 
appears to be shrinking, but the still-rising gap with the 
United States is worrisome, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito 
said Thursday. 
  The merchandise trade figures for May released earlier in 
the 
day underscored "the rising imports and falling exports in terms 
of volume," Saito told a regular news meeting. "But I want to 
see if that becomes a fixed trend, and I'm worried about the 
unchanged (upward) trend with the U.S.," Saito said. 
  The May preliminary figures showed that Japan's surplus fell 
15.9 percent from a year before to score the first fall in six 
months, but the gap with the U.S. continued to rise for the 
third month in a row, gaining 7.5 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The Diet will pass the 
long- overdue state budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 
1, next Wednesday [22 June] at the earliest, Diet sources said 
Wednesday. 
  A leading member of the House of Councillors Budget 
Committee, Masakuni Murakami of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), proposed in talks with Juro Saito, head 
of LDP upper house members, Tuesday night that the upper house 
pass the budget next Wednesday "for the sake of the people," the 
sources said. 
  But Saito reportedly said he considered June 27 an 
"appropriate" date to pass the delayed budget. 
  According to the sources, LDP chief Yohei Kono, Secretary 
General Yoshiro Mori, Saito, Murakami and other members of the 
party's upper house executives will meet Thursday to decide 
their budget strategy. 
  On June 8 the House of Representatives approved the 73.08 
trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. The current Diet session 
ends June 29.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A private think tank urged 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [14 June] to slash 
government spending by 20 trillion yen and nearly halve the 
number of government employees by the year 2004 to make Japan a 
tax-free nation in 2005. 
  In a report submitted to Hata and prepared by its study 
group, the PHP Institute said the government should trim state 
expenditures in a step-by-step manner starting in 1995 to avoid 
raising taxes. 
  Among key proposals in the report: 
  The government should 
  -- Privatize state universities immediately 
  -- Abolish the food agency which tightly regulates rice 
production and distribution 
  -- Ban special entities under the jurisdiction of government 
ministries which absorb retired ex-bureaucrats 
  -- Reduce the number of seats in the House of 
Representatives 
to 250 from the current 511 and that in the House of Councillors 
to 50 from the current 252 
  -- Reduce the number of national government employees by 45 
percent or 520,000 over the next five years 
  -- Integrate the current 21 government ministries and 
agencies and one office into six offices. 
  The institute also said the government could save a total of 
111 trillion yen by the year 2004 if it set aside the money 
saved under fiscal and administrative reforms for a fund for 
welfare purposes. More than half of the fund should be used for 
raising welfare standards to achieve a welfare nation without 
any tax in the year 2005, it said. 
  The report is roughly in line with a persistent opinion 
expressed by the institute's founder, the late Konosuke 
Matsushita, founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
Matsushita had said, "a high tax erodes the will to work. The 
nation should be run without any tax."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- A senior Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) member presented Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 
Wednesday [15 June] with a petition calling for the next general 
election to be held under the new electoral system approved by 
the Diet earlier this year. 
  The petition was signed by LDP lawmaker Yuji Tsushima and 
305 
other House of Representatives legislators, or more than half of 
the 511 lower house members. 
  The new electoral system combining 300 single-seat 
constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats has yet 
to be implemented pending passage of a bill defining the 
electoral districts. 
  Hata told Tsushima and other petitioners that he fully 
agrees 
with the thrust of their petition, officials said. 
  He called on proponents of the new electoral system to work 
together in their respective capacities to see it realized. 
  Tsushima, deputy chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, paid calls later in the day on leaders of the 
Social Democratic Party, New Party Sakigake, the Democratic 
Socialist Party and Komeito, as well as lower house Speaker 
Takako Doi.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A majority of the 511 
members of the Lower House [LH] have supported an interparty 
campaign calling for the next general election to be held under 
the new election system combining single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation, organizers of the drive said 
Tuesday [14 June]. 
  The organizers have collected signatures of 306 lower house 
legislators, including 42 ministers and parliamentary vice 
ministers who signed on condition that their names not be 
disclosed, they said. 
  The other 264 signers comprise 60 lawmakers from the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), 34 from the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [SDPJ-- Social Democratic Party of Japan], 49 from 
Shinseito, 42 from Komeito, 28 from the Japan New Party, 14 from 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 21 from New Party 
Sakigake, Group Seiun and Minshu No Kaze, five from the Liberal 
Party, five from the New Party Mirai, three from the former 
Kaikaku No Kai and three independents, they said. 
  The campaign was arranged to prevent the LDP and the SDP 
from 
proposing a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata that could result in an early lower house general election 
held under the still-existing multiseat constituency system, 
they said. 
  The organizers will show Hata the results Wednesday and urge 
him not to dissolve the lower house, they said. They will also 
meet SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono 
to brief them on the outcome. 
  Yuji Tsushima, acting chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs 
Research Council, and other organizers representing other 
parties met reporters to release the results of the campaign. 
  The new electoral system, under which 300 out of a reduced 
500 lower house seats would be elected from single-seat 
constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional 
representation system, was enacted in January, but it cannot 
take effect until boundaries of the 300 new single-seat 
constituencies are formally legislated.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- House of Councillors 
lawmakers from the ruling coalition and the opposition camp 
agreed Tuesday [14 June] on a wishy-washy plan for electoral 
reform in the upper house, skirting all drastic reform proposals. 
  Following a series of meetings by party representatives, it 
was agreed to increase the number of seats in four 
constituencies and cut those in four others to achieve more 
balanced representation. One seat will be added each to 
constituencies in Kanagawa, Saitama, Miyagi and Gifu 
Prefectures, while Hokkaido will lose two and Hyogo and Fukuoka 
one each. 
  The ruling and opposition parties excluding the Japan 
Communist Party plan to submit the reform bills in the current 
Diet session. Proposals to reduce the total number of seats by 
two from the current 252 and to introduce a vote-for-individual 
formula into the 100-seat proportional representation system 
were both scuttled. 
  Members of the 252-seat upper house are elected either in 
multiseat constituencies or in a 100-seat proportional 
representation system, in which votes are cast for parties, not 
individuals. 
  Because the parties failed to agree on any striking 
electoral 
reform, the upper house poll scheduled for summer will see 
little change from the current system. Diet passage of the 
proposed changes, however, is far from secured, with the end of 
the current session on June 29 approaching, political sources 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The current regular Diet 
session will wind up without an extension on June 29 and a new 
electoral map for the House of Representatives will be discussed 
in the next session, a key political leader predicted Wednesday 
[15 June]. 
  "I do not think there will be an extension of the Diet 
term," 
Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of New Party Sakigake [Shinto 
Sakigake], told a luncheon at the Japan National Press Club. 
  Although the government must have wanted to submit an 
as-yet-unformulated bill that redraws the electoral map for the 
lower house and to extend the 150-day Diet session, it runs 
short of time, he said. 
  "Therefore, there will be no need to extend the Diet term 
for 
debate on key issues," said Takemura, the chief cabinet 
secretary in the last government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  The 15-member Sakigake left the governing coalition in April 
due to differences over major policies and political approach 
with other coalition partners. 
  The administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Japan's 
first minority government since 1955, once appeared ready to 
extend the current Diet session and act upon the redistricting 
legislation in a move to avoid a possible no-confidence motion 
from the opposition camp. 
  The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party has made it 
clear it plans to bring down the Hata government in a 
no-confidence vote. The Social Democratic Party, the 
second-largest opposition force, has also threatened to submit 
the motion by itself.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives Budget Committee decided Thursday [16 June] to 
summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on June 21 to 
testify about his questionable personal finances, which drove 
him out of office in April. 
  Overriding the ruling coalition's objections, Budget 
Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi declared that his panel 
would summon the 56-year-old Hosokawa. As soon as Yamaguchi 
made the announcement, several lower house members openly 
protested while opposition party legislators, including those of 
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), applauded. Members of both 
the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social 
Democratic Party of Japan] are trying to use Hosokawa's plight 
to their advantage and force Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
minority government to step down. Budget panel chairman 
Yamaguchi is an SDP member. 
  The budget panel made the announcement a day after 
Hosokawa's 
former financial secretary appeared before the panel to say 
Hosokawa had indeed paid back a 100 million yen loan borrowed in 
1982 from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. The 
secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, testified under oath at the 
committee about the former premier's questionable financial 
deals, which led to Hosokawa's resignation in April. Miyama 
denied allegations that Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 
million yen loan and that it was received as a secret political 
donation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa has paid back a 100 million yen loan borrowed 
in 1982 from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm, 
Hosokawa's former financial secretary said Wednesday [15 June]. 
  Masatoshi Miyama testified under oath at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee about the former premier's 
alleged shady financial deals, which partly led Hosokawa to 
announce April 8 his intention to resign. 
  Miyama strongly denied allegations that Hosokawa may not 
have 
paid back the 100 million yen loan and that it was received as a 
secret political donation, adding he can "swear by heaven and 
earth." 
  The former secretary carried 20 million yen in cash to 
Sagawa 
Kyubin in fiscal 1983 and handed over 10 million yen annually 
from fiscal 1984 until the loan was paid back in full, he said. 
  Miyama, however, said Hosokawa did not pay back the interest 
on the 100 million yen loan. 
  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., which was later merged into Sagawa 
Kyubin Co., proposed to Miyama in February or March 1983 that 
the trucking group would pay the interest as a political 
donation for Hosokawa, and he accepted the proposal, Miyama said. 
  In his resignation announcement, Hosokawa said he discovered 
that loan interest was received by his office as a political 
contribution for him under an accord with Sagawa Kyubin. 
  About Hosokawa's alleged purchase of 300 shares in 
telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
(NTT), Miyama supported Hosokawa's previous explanations that 
the 1986 transaction was carried out by the former premier's 
late father-in-law, not by Hosokawa himself. 
  Miyama, however, said he did not tell Hosokawa's former 
financial consultant Shozo Fujiki that the stock transaction 
would be made by Hosokawa's father-in-law. 
  Shortly before Hosokawa's announcement to step down, Fujiki 
told a news conference that he had thought it was Hosokawa's 
transaction when he helped the deal. 
  "Now I feel it was insincere," said Miyama, suggesting he 
acted as Hosokawa's secretary when he arranged the transaction. 
  Fujiki also said during the news conference that Miyama 
asked 
a financial company if Hosokawa can borrow money for the NTT 
share purchase under a different person's name. Hosokawa was 
Kumamoto governor at that time. 
  Miyama denied the allegation, saying, "such a thing is not 
in 
my memory at all." 
  Miyama also said Hosokawa has not declared to tax 
authorities 
some 57 million yen in profit made through investments via 
former magazine publisher Yusei Kuwahata. 
  Miyama said most of the profits were used for Hosokawa's 
political activities. 
  Hosokawa said in his April 8 announcement he used his 
personal funds for dealings via an "old friend" from 1981 and 
obtained profits in a way he said could have violated the law. 
  After the Diet testimony by his former aide, Hosokawa 
emphatically said he now has a good reason to reject any call by 
the opposition that he testify himself, and his remarks were 
echoed by top officials of the ruling coalition. 
  The testimony clearly demonstrates that the corruption 
charges against Hosokawa are groundless, said Masuo Matsuoka of 
Japan New Party, which is headed by Hosokawa. 
  "That settled the whole issue," said Kozo Watanabe of 
Shinseito, another coalition party. 
  The two main opposition parties, the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, have no 
intention of stopping hounding the former prime minister. 
  They are poised to make a renewed demand for Hosokawa to 
testify, hoping to set the stage for submission of a motion of 
no confidence in the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  But the ruling coalition will dismiss such a call, coalition 
executives said. 
  "There is nothing left that requires further clarification 
from Hosokawa," one Shinseito kingpin said. 
  The testimony by Miyama has relieved the shaky coalition of 
concerns about possible political repercussions from the issue, 
insiders said. 
  The lingering broadside against Hosokawa's past financial 
impropriety "will have no impact on the political situation," 
said Shinseito's Watanabe. 
  Some coalition officials also took a swipe at the SDP's move 
to join forces with the LDP in demanding Hosokawa's testimony. 
  "That kind of action will make our alliance talks with the 
SDP impossible," one coalition executive said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The heads of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) 
agreed Thursday [16 June] to start consultations to pave the way 
for the country's No. 2 opposition party SDP to return to the 
ruling coalition, party officials said. 
  The two leaders also agreed to set up a policy forum, the 
officials said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and DSP Chairman Takashi 
Yonezawa attended the meeting arranged by the nation's largest 
labor organization, the Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
(Rengo), which provides the main base of support for the two 
parties. The DSP is a junior party in the coalition. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and DSP Secretary General 
Kansei Nakano also attended the session. Rengo President Akira 
Yamagishi represented the 8 million strong labor group at the 
meeting. 
  Murayama told the meeting his party will continue to carry 
out reform policies formulated during the administration of 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, of which the SDP was a 
member party. 
  Yonezawa was quoted as saying he hopes for exchanges of 
opinion between the two parties so that they can deepen their 
understanding and realign the coalition framework. 
  Yamagishi said divisions between the two parties are having 
a 
detrimental effect on Rengo. 
  Yamagishi urged them to rebuild the coalition framework of 
the Hosokawa administration, which preceded the present 
government of prime minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  The SDP, the largest force in the Hosokawa government, 
withdrew from the coalition in late April after the abrupt 
formation of a parliamentary bloc excluding the party, forcing 
Hata to form the first minority government in nearly four 
decades.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives on Thursday [16 June] approved a bill to 
introduce product liability for the first time in Japan and sent 
it to the House of Councillors. 
  The upper house is expected to endorse the bill as early as 
next week, setting the stage for the enforcement of the 
legislation one year later. The new law, the first of its kind 
in Japan, will make it easier for consumers to prove 
manufacturer liability for damage stemming from defective 
products. 
  The legislation had met strong opposition from some 
lawmakers 
within the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest opposition 
party, who had demanded that blood products be exempted. The 
Japan Society of Blood Transfusion had joined the LDP in 
demanding an exemption of blood for transfusion, saying that the 
bill could hurt the blood supply. The opposition did not lead 
any change in the draft bill, but forced the government to 
attach seven resolutions making it clear that an unavoidable 
spread of viruses through blood transfusion at the current 
scientific standards and blood transfusion reactions do not 
constitute defects.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel 
called Thursday [16 June] for "urgently" implementing a set of 
economic restructuring measures to revitalize Japan's economy 
toward the next century. "The Japanese economy now stands at 
the crossroads," the Industrial Structure Council said in a 
report, citing such problems as the rapid aging of the 
population, the lingering current account imbalance and the 
"excessive" strength of the yen. 
  The report urged the government to formulate a reform 
program 
by effectively combining three types of steps -- macroeconomic 
restructuring measures like social infrastructure improvement, 
microeconomic reforms such as deregulation and narrowing of the 
price gap between Japan and other countries, and overhauling the 
industrial structure for new business creation. 
  The advisory body to the minister of international trade and 
industry said the government's failure to carry out these 
measures would deprive the Japanese economy of "industrial 
vitality" toward the next century, promote "industrial 
hollowing" and eventually degrade the overall life standard of 
the Japanese people. "The report is not merely a collection of 
recommendations that simply depict a vision of Japan's future 
economy," a ministry official said. "But it reflects a strong 
sense of crisis among council members about the future course of 
the Japanese economy," the official said. 
  The council cited 12 industrial sectors as having growth 
potential toward the 21st century. They are housing-related 
services, medical and welfare services, culture, urban 
development, environmental improvement, energy, distribution, 
new manufacturing technology, labor services, business support, 
information and communications, and cultural services involved 
in Japan's internationalization. 
  The proposed reform steps would help create a substantial 
amount of new business opportunities in Japan, with the market 
size of such business growing to 210 trillion yen in 2000 from 
the current 130 trillion yen in the 12 sectors combined. The 
council also said the reforms would produce 2.5 million new jobs 
by 2000. 
  If large-scale industrial restructuring is carried out, the 
Japanese economy could achieve an annual growth rate of more 
than 3 percent by the turn of the century, the report said. It 
also said Japan's manpower structure would undergo big changes 
under the proposed economic reform. 
  The proportion of workers in services and livelihood-related 
sectors would increase while those in distribution and 
transportation would drop, for example, the report said. 
Without the proposed reforms, Japan's economic growth would 
slow to an annual average of 1.6 percent during 1992-2000 and an 
average 1.2 percent during 2000-2010, the report said. The 
council said Japan should propose industrial policy coordination 
among developed countries as a way to spur new business 
creation, a step that may present solutions for global 
unemployment. 
  The issue of trade and labor standards should be addressed 
in 
a manner that would enable free trade to be pursued in 
developing countries while upgrading labor conditions there, the 
report said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- A government panel 
advocated a new national development plan Thursday [16 June] 
designed to enhance exchanges among regions and make local 
communities more open to the world. 
  The National Land Development Council's study group also 
called for concrete steps to transfer functions as the nation's 
capital from Tokyo, which it says should become a real 
cosmopolis. 
  The recommendations are included in the group's review on 
the 
Fourth Comprehensive National Development Plan, the nation's 
basic development blueprint compiled in 1987. 
  The council endorsed the group's final report Thursday, 
which 
will serve as the policy outline for the next comprehensive 
plan. The National Land Agency plans to start working on the new 
plan this autumn. 
  The report points to drastic socioeconomic changes since the 
1987 blueprint, such as a declining birth rate and the prolonged 
recession following the burst of speculation bubbles in the late 
1980s. 
  To adjust the national development policy to the changing 
circumstances, the government should fashion a completely new 
plan aimed more at activating exchanges and alliances among 
local communities, it argues. 
  Among recommendations, it advocates formulating "regional 
cooperation axes" under which regions build up multi-layer 
exchanges in cultural, industrial and social fields. 
  The report also urges fostering "small cosmopolis" or local 
communities that maintain direct overseas exchanges in specific 
fields. 
  It notes the importance of creating a high-technology 
service 
industry based on high-power telecommunications networks and of 
more active involvement in environmental issues. 
  All these steps should focus on transforming the national 
development policy from a hardware-oriented to software-oriented 
one, it says. 
  The agency plans to hold dialogues with people nationwide 
from July to September in an effort to seek their understanding 
on the policy shift.

  [Text] Nagoya, June 15 KYODO -- Japan's top automaker 
Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday [15 June] its automobile 
production in June is likely to mark the first year-on-year rise 
in 13 months, fueled by brisk demand for the newly introduced, 
low-priced RAV4 recreational vehicle. 
  The company said June production is expected to top the 
previous year's level of 313,000 units, the first year-on-year 
rise since may last year. 
  "There is a strong possibility that domestic automobile 
sales 
will begin to pick up in the latter half of this year, spurred 
by the marketing of new models," said Iwao Isomura, vice 
president of the company. 
  The company said orders for the RAV4 model totaled 17,000 in 
the first month after it was marketed, far surpassing the 
monthly sales target of 2,000 units. 
  It said it plans to introduce restyled versions of 
medium-sized cars "Vista" and "Camry" in July at prices 
comparable to their old models. 
  Isomura expressed hope that Toyota's car sales will expand 
in 
July, enabling the company to attain its sales goal of 2.16 
million units this year.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Toshiba Corp. said Tuesday 
[14 Jun] it will begin global marketing of a new red-light 
semiconductor laser diode that significantly increases the 
storage capacity of optical disk systems. 
  The TOLD9151mb operates at a wavelength of 685 nanometers, 
compared with the 780 nanometers currently used in optical disk 
systems, Toshiba said. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. 
  The smaller spot size allows almost double the volume of 
information to be stored on the same size disk, it said. 
  Mass production of the device, at some 60,000 units per 
month, will begin at the end of the year. Toshiba has begun 
shipping samples of the laser diode at a price of 15,000 yen per 
unit.

  [Text] An official of the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and 
Energy revealed recently that Intercore, an American investment 
company dealing in electricity which has signed an agreement on 
a project to build a 100-megawatt electric plant in Phnom Penh 
seems to be having problems. 
  The official said that one and a half months have elapsed 
since an agreement was signed on construction of an electric 
plant on 26 April between the company and the Ministry of 
Industry, Mines, and Energy. But, until now, this big American 
company has not gotten in touch with the ministry. He added 
that one week after the official signing ceremony held under the 
joint chairmanship of the second prime minister and His 
Excellency Charles Twining, U.S. ambassador, a representative of 
the American company went to remind the ministry to quickly find 
a location for the plant so that construction arrangements for 
the project could be made after a short trip to the United 
States. 
  Half of the 90-day initiation period for the American 
company 
to start construction has now elapsed. According to the 
agreement, if nothing is initiated within 90 days after the 
signing, the agreement is considered worthless. 
  The ministry has already arranged a plot of land, 10,000 
square meters, near the SKD [Cambodian Distillery Plant] for 
building the plant as requested by the representative. 
  Another official of the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and 
Energy revealed that the American company seems to be having 
problems. He added that the ministry will wait a few more weeks 
at most before concluding that the company really faces problems 
if it remains silent.

  [Text] The Public Relations Office of Surin Province 
reported that yesterday officials of military unit 2332, of 
Infantry Task Force 23 attached to the Suranari force, were 
informed that a group of six Cambodian bandits armed with five 
AK rifles and one RPG gun illegally crossed the border to 
capture four Thai citizens and take them into Cambodia. 
  The infantry task force then set up a temporary operations 
center to coordinate assistance to the hostages and ordered the 
local troops of the Suranari force to search for the bandits. 
As a result, the bandits released one hostage to procure 20,000 
baht in cash as ransom for the release of the remaining 
hostages. Further developments will be reported later.

<F P=106> [Report on 29 May interview with Deputy Prime Minister Tran </F>
Duc Luong by SAIGON GIAI PHONG correspondent Oanh Van; place not 
given] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong returned to 
Hanoi on the afternoon of 29 May after his visit to the United 
States from 18-28 May. During his 10-day visit to the United 
States, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong met and had 
contacts with many high-ranking U.S. officials as well as 
representatives of the U.S. business circle. On his return 
home, the deputy prime minister gave an interview to the 
newspaper SAIGON GIAI PHONG. He said: 
  - I led the Vietnamese delegation to visit the United States 
at the invitation of the "International Conference on Economic 
Development." We attended three seminars held in Washington, 
New York, and San Francisco. U.S. business circles showed great 
interest in these seminars. The number of participants in these 
seminars consistently exceeded the figure of people invited. At 
the Washington seminar, only 200 people were invited but there 
were as many as 250 people attending. At the New York seminar, 
there were 200 people participating compared with only 150 
people invited. Most of the questions raised by U.S. business 
concerns were very realistic, substantial, and practical. U.S. 
business concerns believe that the time is ripe for them to 
enter Vietnam. 
  We also met U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, a number of 
U.S. congressmen, and the U.S. [Senate] Foreign Relations 
Committee. Through these meetings, the U.S. side agreed with 
the Vietnamese side that it is now time to end the post-war 
period of tension and to start the process of gradually building 
normal relations and advance toward building fine foreign 
relations between the United States and Vietnam. This is in the 
interests of the United States, Vietnam, and the trend toward 
peace, stability, and cooperation in the region. 
  While in the United States, I also visited the president of 
the World Bank, the director-general of the International 
Monetary Fund, and the chairman of the UN Development Program. 
All of the heads of these organizations affirmed that they 
would provide positive assistance to various cooperative 
projects with Vietnam. 
  [Correspondent] Did the U.S. business concerns mention any 
obstacles encountered while investing in Vietnam 
  [Tran Duc Luong] Apart from highly appreciating the 
opportunities for doing business in Vietnam, U.S. businessmen 
also pointed out three main obstacles encountered by them when 
engaged in doing business in Vietnam. They are: 1. The 
Vietnamese legal system is not perfect; 2. Vietnam's 
infrastructure is still weak; and 3. Vietnam's administrative 
procedures are cumbersome and complex. 
  [Correspondent] Did we sound out the prospects for exporting 
Vietnamese goods to the United States? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] During various contacts, both the U.S. 
political circles and U.S. businessmen admitted that to promote 
increased trade investment between the United States and 
Vietnam, we need the efforts of both sides. It is precisely 
because of this that they [U.S. businessmen] also were concerned 
about how to help Vietnam export its goods to the United States. 
Vietnam's exports, including rice and beer, to the United 
States have been made in small quantities. While in the United 
States, I was told by the U.S. business concerns that it welcome 
the return of Vietnamese goods to the U.S. market after many 
years of absence. I met with groups of U.S. businessmen and we 
initially agreed on the signing of certain contracts for the 
export of goods to the United States. Of course, the export of 
goods to the United States can develop satisfactorily only when 
the United States grants Vietnam the most-favored nation status. 
  [Correspondent] As you have already met Secretary of State 
Christopher, could you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, speak of the 
substance of the meeting? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] The meeting was focused on the relations 
between the two countries and other regional issues. 
  [Correspondent] Did the two sides deal with the follow-up 
"road map" of U.S.-Vietnamese relations? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] At various meetings and seminars where they 
spoke, U.S. officials never dealt with any "timetables." They 
only said that the bilateral relations would achieve rapid 
development if residual issues are satisfactorily resolved. 
  [Correspondent] Will the Assistant U.S. Secretary of State 
Winston Lord arrive in Vietnam in late June for visit? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] I met Mr. Winston Lord after I had met Mr. 
Warren Christopher. At that meeting, Mr. Winston Lord handed me 
a note from the U.S. State Department on its consent to a 
decision to officially make public the news about the 
establishment of liaison offices in the capitals of the two 
countries. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any reaction from the U.S. 
public? When will the liaison offices be opened in the two 
countries' capitals? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] This news met with a warm welcome from the 
U.S. public, particularly from U.S. business circles. Many 
people in business in the U.S. even asked the U.S. Government to 
move further toward promptly granting Vietnam the most-favored 
nation status. 
  The liaison offices will function like Consulates General. 
Mr. James Habi who has been nominated by the U.S. Government to 
head the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi said in a seminar that at 
the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi, there would be economic 
specialists whose duty is to provide assistance to U.S. 
businessmen. At present, the two countries are finalizing 
various procedures about administration and staffing so the two 
offices can soon be put into operations. The U.S. side also took 
me on a visit to the building where the Vietnamese Liaison 
Office in the United States will be headquartered. The building 
is located within the foreign embassies' quarter in Washington. 
This building, formerly belonging to Vietnam, has been well 
maintained by the U.S. side. 
  [Correspondent] During his meeting with you, did Secretary 
of 
State Warren Christopher say that increased U.S.-Vietnamese 
relations would have an impact on regional peace and stability? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] Both the United States and Vietnam hold 
that the Asia-Pacific region in general and the Southeast Asian 
region in particular is a dynamically developing region with 
fine economic prospects. This trend requires countries in the 
region to take responsibility for maintaining peace and 
stability so the region can develop favorably. The United 
States realizes Vietnam's important role in Southeast Asia and 
wants Vietnam to shoulder [ganhs vacs] the common duty of 
maintaining regional peace and stability. For its part, Vietnam 
believes that the United States has an important say and role in 
maintaining regional peace and stability and hopes that the 
United States will fulfill this mandate. Increased 
U.S.-Vietnamese relations will certainly have a positive impact 
on the region. 
  [Correspondent] Will the two countries' embassies in their 
respective capitals be opened in the not-too-distant future? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] No one can give a specific timing. The 
only thing I know is that if the two governments continue to 
resolve their residual issues as they are doing now, the process 
of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese relations will achieve rapid 
progress. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by Minh Ha, </F>
correspondent of the SAIGON GIAI PHONG, on relations between 
Vietnam and Southeast Asian countries] 
  [Text] With the recent friendly official visit to Myanmar 
[Burma] by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, our leaders have thus far 
visited all countries in the Southeast Asian region, and have 
laid an important foundation for a new period of cooperation 
between Vietnam and countries in the region. On this occasion, 
Comrade Nguyen Manh Cam, member of the Party Central Committee 
Political Bureau and minister of foreign affairs granted SAIGON 
GIAI PHONG an exclusive interview. 
  [Correspondent] Dear minister: Our leaders have visited all 
countries in the Southeast Asian region, and many leaders in the 
region have also visited us. Through all these high level 
visits, what can we say about Vietnamese-Southeast Asian 
relations, and particularly Vietnamese-ASEAN relations? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] The implementation of the foreign affairs 
policy in the direction of diversification and 
multilateralization has rapidly boosted our relationship with 
countries in the Southeast Asian region and this will certainly 
be developed even more rapidly in the period to come. The 
recent visits exchanged between Vietnamese leaders and leaders 
of ASEAN countries reflect the common aspiration of countries in 
the region as well as ourselves to speed up the expansion of our 
multifaceted cooperative relations. 
  The fine relations between Vietnam and Southeast Asian 
countries are evidence that the current trend in the region is 
cooperation for development. In parallel with the development 
of bilateral relations between Vietnam and each of the Southeast 
Asian countries, all ASEAN countries also wish that Vietnam will 
soon become an official member of the ASEAN organization. On 
our part, with positive support from ASEAN, we are taking 
practical steps to prepare for full membership of ASEAN soon. 
When Vietnam becomes an official ASEAN member, it will not only 
consolidate and develop the bilateral and multilateral relations 
between Vietnam and ASEAN, but will also contribute positively 
to the trend of cooperation and development in Southeast Asia in 
particular, and Asia-Pacific in general. 
  [Correspondent] How should Vietnam prepare to join this 
organization? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] The cooperation among ASEAN members cover 
many fields, not only economy and trade, but also science and 
technology, culture, education, tourism, physical education, 
sports, and so forth. We need to study the activities of each 
of the committees and the features and magnitude of their 
projects, and from there we can prepare suitable steps for each 
field so that once we become a full member of ASEAN, we will be 
able to integrate immediately into the smooth-running 
cooperation mechanism of the organization. 
  We also need to study more thoroughly the operational 
regulations of ASEAN in order to determine appropriate 
cooperation methods that will ensure efficiency and benefits for 
both our country and the countries in the region. In addition, 
we should consult with and learn from the experiences of ASEAN 
members -- from both their successes and failures during the 
cooperation process and in the operation of national committees, 
as well as the regulation and coordination of various domestic 
sectors so that we can arrange our activities in accordance with 
ASEAN requirements. 
  [Correspondent] Vietnam has become an observer of ASEAN. 
What are the next steps from now until we become an official 
member of ASEAN? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] Some ASEAN countries have suggested that 
we 
choose either one of the two following ways. The first option 
is to gradually join in committees and cooperation projects, and 
once we have joined all the committees and projects we would 
become an official member. The other option is to join 
selectively a number of committees and cooperation projects in 
certain fields, then we would become an official member and 
could continue to join in the remaining committees and projects. 
Many friends in ASEAN countries have advised us not to pursue 
perfection, and to choose the second option. I agree with that 
advice. 
  So far, as an observer, Vietnam has joined six committees 
and 
five specific cooperation projects of ASEAN. We will soon be 
able to officially join the organization and then we will 
continue to join other cooperation projects. 
  [Correspondent] What will be the effects in the event of 
Vietnam obtaining full ASEAN membership? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] The cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN 
in general, and with each ASEAN member country, will become 
closer once we become an official member of ASEAN. It will be 
beneficial for both Vietnam and ASEAN, the development of our 
country, and the region. It will also be an important 
contribution to the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation 
in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  [Correspondent] Is it true as somebody has suggested that if 
Vietnam joins ASEAN in the current situation, it will suffer 
some difficulties caused by the unequal development levels and 
the different economic structures in Vietnam and ASEAN member 
countries? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] It is true that there is an inequality in 
economic development between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries, 
but within the ASEAN organization itself the development levels 
of member countries are also unequal. ASEAN member countries, 
therefore, do not see it as an obstacle. In fact the 
comprehensive cooperation will create conditions for 
complementing each other, helping slow countries to catch up 
with fast developing ones, thus boosting development in the 
whole region. For that reason all ASEAN member countries have 
made it clear that they wish Vietnam to become a full member of 
ASEAN soon. 
  [Correspondent] ASEAN will become a free trade (AFTA) region 
in the next ten years. How would that effect the Vietnamese 
economy if by then Vietnam were still not a ASEAN member? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] When ASEAN member countries complete the 
establishment of the free trade region (AFTA), all merchandise 
exchanged among the countries concerned will be subjected to low 
tax or be free of tax. The tax scale will be reduced to about 5 
percent to nil. If by then Vietnam is still not a member of 
ASEAN, we will not have those privileges, and our trade 
activities will face certain difficulties as our exported goods 
to ASEAN will be taxed at a higher rate, thus reducing their 
competitiveness. If Vietnam is then a member of the free trade 
region, the trade relations between Vietnam and ASEAN member 
countries will benefit and expand speedily, thus contributing to 
the development of Vietnam and other countries in the region. 
  [Correspondent] Dear minister, what is the role of ASEAN in 
resolving common problems in the region? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] Honoring the principle of "unity in 
diversity" the ASEAN member countries cooperate but respect each 
other, implement joint decisions and work together but respect 
the sovereignty of each country. Thanks to that principle, 
ASEAN has become a regional organization, the voice of which has 
carried more and more weight in international and regional 
forums. It surely has a decisive role in resolving common 
regional problems. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, dear minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: We Should Discuss Japan's Bid for UNSC </F>
Permanent Membership] 
  [Text] Hisashi Owada, ambassador to the United Nations, at 
a meeting held by the working group on reforming the UN Security 
Council [UNSC], announced: "Japan is willing to do its best as 
a permanent member of the Security Council to work for world 
security and stability." 
  His comment indicates in clearer terms than before the 
government's stance that it wants to obtain a permanent seat in 
the UNSC to contribute to the international community. 
  Becoming a permanent member of the UNSC is an extremely 
important choice for Japan to make because it will determine its 
future course. However, no thorough discussions on this issue 
have yet been held, even in the Diet. We are deeply concerned 
that the government has repeatedly indicated its intention to 
seek a permanent seat in the UNSC while making no efforts to 
answer questions from the people or to form a national consensus. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has long displayed a positive 
attitude toward obtaining the permanent membership. At a 
question-and-answer session held at the Diet last month, he 
expressed his willingness by saying: "If Japan, a nonnuclear 
nation, joins the UNSC as a permanent member, it will strengthen 
UN functions." 
  In his speech given at the UN General Assembly last fall, 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa merely showed a moderate 
stance on Japan's bid to become a permanent UNSC member. 
Regarding the UNSC reform issue, he said: "It is important to 
actively make good use of the member nations, which have the 
will and capability to contribute to world prosperity and 
stability." 
  It must be pointed out that "prosperity and stability" in 
Hosokawa's speech was changed to "security and stability" in 
Owada's remarks. Obviously, the Hata administration has gone a 
step further than the former administration. 
  Diplomatic authorities seem to think that Owada's recent 
remarks only indicate an already established policy in line with 
the stance expressed by Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa. 
  However, what is the meaning of Japan's joining the UNSC, 
which is comprised of five nuclear power nations, and how should 
Japan think of responsibilities and obligations to protect 
security in view of its pacifist Constitution? Regarding these 
basic questions, it cannot be said that we have had satisfactory 
discussions and explanations. 
  At the aforementioned question-and-answer session, Tomiichi 
Mirayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], called for revision or abolishment of the current UNSC 
permanent membership system and said: "Being a major power in 
the United Nations, obtaining an important post in the old 
United Nations should not be Japan's UN diplomatic objective." 
Although the Hata administration is expecting the SDPJ to 
return to the coalition, there still is a large gap between them 
regarding the issue of permanent UNSC membership. 
  Shinto Sakigake [New Harbinger] head Masayoshi Takemura even 
directly criticized the government by saying: "I doubt it is a 
good idea for the government to repeatedly express at diplomatic 
venues the positive stance of becoming a permanent member before 
forming a national consensus." 
  Because political leaders and parties have been absorbed in 
the political warfare under the current fluid political 
condition, they failed to deepen discussions on such important 
issue. This must be called political negligence. However, this 
does not mean that politicians should let bureaucrats take over 
the issue without going through formalities and making efforts 
to form a national consensus. 
  From the statement that Japan was asked to submit to the 
International Court of Justice to present its opinion on the 
legal status of the use of nuclear weapons, the government just 
deleted a sentence that said the use of nuclear weapons "is not 
necessarily a violation of international law." This must be 
taken as a lesson and the government must realize that a 
diplomatic stance will not be established without taking the 
people's will and sentiments into consideration. 
  On one hand, Prime Minister Hata explained how significant 
it 
is for Japan, "a nonnuclear nation," to become a permanent 
member of the UNSC. On the other hand, he accepted the Foreign 
Ministry's view that "the use of nuclear weapons is not a 
violation of the law" -- a view shared by nuclear nations -- 
until criticism erupted from various sectors. This indicates 
how shaky his determination is to carry through Japan's stance 
in the UNSC. 
  Therefore, we must immediately start in-depth discussion on 
what is the meaning of Japan's pursuing permanent UNSC 
membership by taking various viewpoints into consideration.

<F P=106> [Article by Seoul correspondent Yasunobu Shirouchi; first in </F>
a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected 
Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the 
International Community"; "The North's Strategy: North Korea 
Aims To Improve Ties With the U.S. as a Trump Card for Survival"] 
  [Text] Commenting on the second round of the U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks held last July, North Korean Premier Kang 
Song-san remarked: "The joint statement issued by North Korea 
and the United States at the end of the talks is a historical 
event ending 40 years of hostile relations between the two 
countries and laying the groundwork for resolving the nuclear 
issue." 
  In March last year, North Korea announced that it would quit 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). North Korea has 
since used its "nuclear card" to force the United States to hold 
a dialogue with it and push the international community around 
while holding up its actual withdrawal from the NPT. 
  The Korean peninsula has been a zone where superpower 
interests have clashed. The Koreans have a history of the 
superpowers defying their will and their nation's existence was 
denied. They have a deep-rooted desire to get neighboring 
superpowers to pay attention to the Korean peninsula and get 
them to listen to what they advocate. 
  North Korea aims to have U.S. Forces withdrawn from South 
Korea. President Kim Il-song's basic perception is that South 
Korea is occupied by U.S. Forces. The president has 
consistently asserted that the only way to end the division on 
the Korean peninsula is to make direct deals with the United 
States. In that sense, the "nuclear" is his most effective 
trump card. 
  Kang In-tok, head of the Far East Affairs Research Institute 
in Seoul, South Korea, who is well versed with North Korean 
affairs, has said: "For North Korea, the nuclear issue is a 
'strategy for survival'." North Korea is said to be suffering 
serious economic stagnation and if the present situation 
continues, it would be hard for North Korea to keep its present 
system in place. Kang also has explained that North Korea 
intends to use the "nuclear card" to receive economic aid from 
the United States after normalizing relations with the United 
States and obtain a U.S. guarantee for the maintenance of its 
system. 
  Many North Korea watchers in Seoul have pointed out that 
"North Korea is serious about developing nuclear weapons." 
Their common analysis is that North Korea aims to 1) reverse 
its inferiority in conventional war capability over South Korea; 
2) tighten the grip on its system that is being shaken by food 
shortages; and, 3) spurn outside pressure. 
  North Korea recently removed fuel rods at an experimental 
atomic reactor in defiance of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency's [IAEA] demand for halting their removal at the expense 
of the third round of the U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. A 
diplomatic source in Seoul has said: "North Korea did so 
because it was intent on developing nuclear weapons." 
  Yun Tok-min, a professor at the South Korean Foreign 
Ministry 
Diplomacy and Security Research Institute, has analyzed: "North 
Korea abruptly strained the situation on the Korean peninsula in 
an attempt to "make the United States acknowledge the 
inevitability of allowing North Korea to have one or two atomic 
bombs." He also has said North Korea might believe that the 
Clinton administration would give in to its threats. 
  The North Korean Foreign Ministry abruptly announced North 
Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA on 13 June, dealing a sharp 
body blow to brisk moves toward slapping sanctions against North 
Korea. The announcement did not use the term "North Korea's 
withdrawal from the NPT" and the announcement is taken as part 
of North Korea's operations aimed at holding talks with the 
United States. 
  The prevailing view is that "at present, the top priority 
task for North Korea is to prepare for a succession from 
President Kim Il-song to Secretary Kim Chong-il and the 
possibility is slim that North Korea will opt for war, which 
could result in its collapse" (says a Seoul-based expert on 
North Korea). Some experts on North Korea take the view that if 
economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, North Korea 
would make some concessions for fear that the sanctions may deal 
it a fatal blow. 
  Will North Korea aim to normalize relations with the United 
States without giving up its nuclear program? If the Kim 
Il-song regime aims to achieve these two incompatible goals, it 
would further deepen its international isolation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The latest Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor trade talks did not take up the issue of whether 
or not to terminate a bilateral microchip pact after the July 
1996 expiration, a senior Japanese Trade Ministry official said 
Thursday [16 June]. 
  "During the just-ended trade session, both parties agreed to 
take time toward July 31 this year in studying the issue," 
Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, 
told a press conference. 
  Japan and the United States must decide whether or not to 
end 
the 1991 chip accord by the end of July. 
  The accord calls for Japan to maintain a "gradual and 
steady" 
increase in the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market 
above 20 percent. 
  The two-day microchip trade talks followed an announcement 
that foreign-made semiconductors continued to seize more than 20 
percent of the Japanese market in the January-March period.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Thursday [16 June] evaluated foreign access to Japan's 
semiconductor market but avoided discussing whether or not to 
end a bilateral chip trade pact before the July 1996 expiration, 
a Japanese Trade Ministry official said. 
  During regular chip trade talks in Tokyo, both parties 
instead agreed to review the "appropriateness" of an earlier 
termination to the pact by the end of July this year, the 
Japanese official told a press conference. The U.S. "has made 
clear it has no interest" in an early termination, a U.S. 
official told reporters. "It is important to see the agreement 
will run its full course." Japan's stance on the issue has yet 
to be decided, the Japanese official said. 
  The July 1991 bilateral chip trade accord calls for Japan to 
maintain a "gradual and steady" increase in the foreign chip 
share of the Japanese market above the 20 percent level. Under 
the pact, both parties are required to decide at the end of July 
this year whether or not to end it before the 1996 expiration. 
  The two-day session, the second of its kind this year 
following the Hawaii gathering in March, came after Tuesday's 
announcement that foreign-made semiconductor chips continued to 
seize more than 20 percent of the Japanese market in the 
January-March quarter. 
  The latest meeting assessed the first-quarter foreign chip 
share, the recent increase in foreign chip sales in Japan and 
implementation of "design-in" joint cooperation programs for 
making chips from the development stage, the Japanese official 
said. Washington appreciates the latest foreign chip share, the 
U.S. Official said. 
  The Japanese side sought further marketing efforts from U.S. 
Chip makers, including securing a stable product supply, the 
Japanese official said, noting some types of foreign chips are 
in short supply in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said Wednesday [15 June] it 
will hold a public hearing in Tokyo on July 7 and 8 on imports 
of U.S.-grown apples. 
  The ministry said it will take applications from those who 
want to speak at the hearing until June 24. 
  With U.S. quarantine measures to prevent apple disease 
having 
already cleared Japanese requirements, Japan plans to lift its 
ban on imports of U.S. apples this fall. 
  Japan has kept its market closed to U.S. apples, citing 
worms 
and disease which it had said could contaminate Japanese crops. 
  Ministry sources said that at a similar hearing in April 
last 
year on imports of New Zealand apples, domestic apple growers 
clamored for the continued ban on foreign apples.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- As already reported, 
the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea in a statement of its spokesman declared that the DPRK 
would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] in answer to the grave encroachment upon the 
dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK by the Secretariat of the 
agency. 
  In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says the DPRK's 
withdrawal from the IAEA is a legitimate self-defensive measure 
to defend its sovereignty and existence as a dignified 
independent, sovereign state. 
  The responsibility for its withdrawal from the IAEA rests 
entirely with the agency, the analyst says, and goes on: 
  We joined the agency in September 1974, believing its 
impartiality and hoping that its assistance would be conducive 
to our peaceful nuclear activities. 
  After we signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] 
in 
December 1985 and concluded the safeguards agreement in January 
1992, however, the Secretariat of the agency has zealously 
joined the United States in its moves to isolate and stifle the 
DPRK, contrary to its mission and function, and some officials 
of the Secretariat intentionally created "inconsistency" and 
adopted a resolution demanding "a special inspection" of our 
military sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities. 
  Such unjustifiable acts of theirs resulted in forcing the 
DPRK to declare its withdrawal from the NPT. 
  It was for the removal of the U.S. nuclear threat and the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula that we joined the NPT. 
The Secretariat of the agency, however, encroached upon the 
supreme interests of our state and cried to stifle the DPRK, 
abusing the NPT. Under this condition, we could no longer hope 
for its help. Later, we temporarily suspended the effectuation 
of our declared withdrawal from the NPT in June 1993 on 
condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution to 
the nuclear issue would continue on an equal and fair basis. 
  Even in a unique status following the temporary suspension 
of 
our withdrawal from the NPT, we had honestly accepted 
inspections for the continuity of safeguards and allowed even 
"an additional inspection." But the United States and some 
pro-U.S. officials of the Secretariat had used inspections as a 
leverage for infringing on our sovereignty and stifling the 
DPRK, refusing to recognize its special status and intentionally 
laying obstacles to the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The agency's anti-DPRK moves reached the extent where it 
adopted an unreasonable "resolution" on the discontinuation of 
"its assistance" to the DPRK at the meeting of the governors' 
board on June 10, demanding the opening of our military sites to 
public under the pretext of the nuclear issue. 
  Such being the situation, we did not feel the need to have 
dealings with the agency any more and reached the conclusion 
that we could no longer hope for its help. 
  Now that we declared the withdrawal from the agency, we will 
not bound in the legal point of view to the "resolutions" or 
steps which the governors' board has adopted and taken or will 
adopt and take in the future, and we are not obliged to 
implement them. Now the agency is not in a position to dictate 
to us. 
  The freedom of choice is not a monopoly of the United States 
and the Secretariat of the agency. 
  Whether our special status following the temporary 
suspension 
of the withdrawal from the NPT is removed or we completely 
withdraw from it, fully depends on the future developments. 
  If the United States and its allies resort to a strong arm 
to 
stifle the DPRK, ignoring its special status and abusing the 
NPT, we cannot but make another choice.

<F P=106> ["Military Pressure Cannot Be Justified"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The United States is 
massing huge aggression forces around the Korean peninsula, 
scheming to impose "sanctions" upon the DPRK. Commenting on 
this, NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today says: 
  This eloquently proves that it does not want to truly solve 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but is trying to 
stifle the DPRK militarily on the pretext of the "nuclear 
development". 
  It is entirely wrong for the U.S. to put military pressure 
on 
the DPRK over the "nuclear issue". 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cropped up when 
the 
U.S. deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea and resorted to 
nuclear threat against the North. The United States has turned 
South Korea into the largest nuclear base in the Far East, 
targeting its Asian strategy against the Korean peninsula. 
Owing to the nuclear war moves of the United States, South 
Korea has turned into a most dangerous hotbed of a nuclear war 
in the world and the Korean people have to live under a constant 
nuclear threat of the U.S. thus the United States gave rise to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and is gravely 
threatening the DPRK with nuclear weapons. Yet it is increasing 
military pressure on the DPRK over its "nuclear development". 
This is a shameless act which reminds us of a guilty party 
filing the suit first. 
  The DPRK's nuclear activities, in view of their peaceful 
nature, cannot be a pretext of pressure. Its nuclear activities 
are designed to solve the problem of energy badly needed for 
economic construction and the DPRK's atomic energy facilities 
strictly serve this purpose. There is nothing else in its 
nuclear activities. Nevertheless, the U.S. is putting military 
pressure on the DPRK on groundless charges. This tells that the 
United States has not yet given up the scheme to stifle Korean 
socialism with strength. 
  In view of the sincere efforts made by the DPRK till now for 
a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the 
U.S. military pressure cannot be justified. 
  For a peaceful and fair solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, we have consistently called for dialogue and 
negotiation and made a signal overture for a package solution to 
the issue. 
  If the United States had come out to the third-round 
DPRK-U.S. talks and the nuclear issue had been solved in a 
package deal, the state would not have developed as now. 
  The DPRK's reactor core refueling cannot be a pretext of 
military pressure. 
  We urged the International Atomic Energy Agency five times 
to 
take measures needed for core refueling and notified the U.S. 
side that, if a package solution were achieved and the unique 
status of the DPRK removed, though belatedly, we could allow all 
the routine and ad hoc inspections including the selected 
preservation of fuel rods even in the course of core refueling. 
  Facts show that the failure to resolve the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula is wholly attributable to the United States 
and some dishonest quarters of the IAEA secretariat. 
  The criminal attempt to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula while blocking its 
solution can never be tolerated. 
  The Korean people who regard independence as their life and 
soul would decisively react, if the United States ventured a 
military provocation against the DPRK over the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam 
arranged a reception for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and 
his entourage on a visit to our country at the Moknan House last 
night. Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong and others officials 
concerned attended the reception. 
  Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam delivered a speech at the 
reception. He said he would like to believe that Mr. Carter's 
unusual current visit to our country would mark a good sign in 
gradually turning the distrust and hostility lasting between the 
two countries into relations of friendship, amity, and mutual 
respect [chimi kato sonsaengui pomsangchi anun ibon urinara 
pangmuni tunara saie chisoktoegoinnun pulsingwa choktaegamul 
sollingwa uho hosang chonjunguro chomcha pakkuo nagalsu innun 
choun chingjorago mitkkosiptta]. 
  He said that it is the current trend of international 
relations to advance toward reconciliation, friendship, and 
cooperation after the Cold War ended, and that it is also the 
common desire of the peoples of the two countries to establish 
normal relations [chongsangjogin kwangyerul maennun kosun] 
between the DPRK and the United States by ending [chongsan] 
hostile relations between them. 
  He said: If the United States respects our country's 
sovereignty and treats it as an equal partner by discarding the 
concept of confrontation with us, the pending issues between the 
DPRK and the United States, including the nuclear issue, will be 
resolved satisfactorily and the two countries can live on good 
terms with each other. He believes that this will immediately 
contribute to peace in Asia and the rest of the world. 
  He said that Jimmy Carter, crossing through Panmunjom, would 
have directly witnessed the tragic division of the Korean 
peninsula, as well as felt the pain of the Korean people -- the 
same nation with the same blood, who has suffered for nearly 50 
years because of its artificial division on the single territory 
and added: Our people ardently desire reunification and hope for 
a true peace. 
  Also, he said: I believe that you will be able to deliver 
our 
people's resolute desire for peace and our Republic's 
peace-loving position to the people of the United States and to 
the social circles throughout the world the way they really are 
[kunun ttohan tangsinduri uriinminui kyongyolhan tongil 
yolmanggwa uri konghwagukui pyonghwa aehojokin ipchangul 
migugindulka segye sahoegyee sasil kutaero chondal harirago 
minnundago malhaessupnida]. 
  He said: I think that Jimmy Carter's visit, made at his own 
initiative, and that of his entourage would lead to a thaw in 
the frozen relations between the two countries and to creating a 
peaceful environment. He stated: I hope that I can meet various 
U.S. politicians, including Mr. Carter, to openheartedly 
exchange views in the future as well. 
  Then, Jimmy Carter delivered a speech. He said that he is 
very pleased to come to the DPRK after anticipating it for three 
years. He said: The time has come to establish overall 
relations, including full friendship, understanding, trade, and 
exchange of visits, between the two countries. [tunaraga 
wanjonhan chinsongwa ihae muyok insa kyoryurul pirotan 
chonmyonjogin kwangyerul surip halttaega toettago hamyonso] The 
United States is ready to render its due cooperation to the DPRK 
to achieve this goal [i mokchogul sirhyonhame issoso ungdang 
chosonminjujuui inmin konghwagukkwa hyopchohal chunbiga toeo 
ittago malhaessumnida]. 
  He pointed out that it is the nuclear issue that has created 
a big misunderstanding between North Korea and the United States 
at present, and that if the nuclear issue is resolved clearly 
and the misunderstanding is removed, progress can be made in 
solving other problems. 
  He pointed out that he could not but feel sadness when he 
saw 
the division of Korea, crossing over the Demilitarized Zone 
today, and that the U.S. leaders believe that Korea should be 
reunified peacefully without fail, [migugui chodojadurun chosoni 
pandusi pyonghwajoguro tongil toeoya handago mitkko issumyo] and 
that he also believes that it can be done. 
  He said: Despite the differences in opinions between the two 
countries, those problems can be easily solved when the two 
countries make efforts together to achieve their common goals. 
These problems can be solved by direct talks between the two 
countries and their mutual understanding can be promoted as well 
[iwagwaun munjewa kwanryonhayo chijop hoedamul tonghayo 
hosangihaerul chungjin sikil su iddago malhaetta]. 
  Participants in the reception proposed a toast for the 
friendship, peace of the people of the two countries, for the 
long life and good health of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and for the 
good health of Mr. Jimmy Carter. 
  Pyongyang artists performed at the reception.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Foreigners denounced 
the pressure campaign of the United States and its followers 
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Alhaji A.B. Ziblim, general secretary of the National 
Convention Party of Ghana, in a statement June 7 expressed deep 
apprehensions over the pressure campaign of the United States 
and some other countries, saying the "presidential statement" 
published by the UN Security Council recently cannot be 
construed otherwise than part of the sinister political plot to 
destroy socialist Korea. 
  He contended that the Secretariat of the International 
Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN Security Council should abide by 
the principles of justice and impartiality, instead of complying 
with the unreasonable demand of the United States. 
  E. Balanandan, Politburo member of the C.C. [Central 
Committee], Communist Party of India (Marxist), in his statement 
June 5 referred to the U.S. act of inveigling even the UN 
Security Council and the IAEA in its campaign against the DPRK, 
ignoring the unique status of the DPRK after it temporarily 
suspended the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. He demanded that the United 
Nations renounce the double-standard policy and approach the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula on the principles of 
respect for sovereignty and impartiality. 
  E.K. Ganguli, director of the Asia-Pacific regional office 
of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in an interview with 
the KCNA correspondent in India June 5, denounced the anti-DPRK 
campaign of the United States and its followers and strongly 
urged that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be 
solved fairly through talks between the DPRK and the United 
States. 
  D.P. Maheshwari, chairman of the Indian Federation for World 
Cooperation and Cultural Relations, in an interview with the 
KCNA correspondent in New Delhi June 6 condemned as dastardly 
the acts of the United States in refusing to come out to 
third-round talks with the DPRK, kicking up a clamorous row for 
pressure against the DPRK on the basis of a unilateral and 
biased report submitted by some members of the IAEA Secretariat 
without so much as a study of the Korean-style method of reactor 
core refueling at the experimental atomic power plant. 
  A tough measure cannot be a solution to the issue, he said, 
adding that the U.S. imperialists should draw a proper lesson 
from the ignominious defeat it sustained in the Korean war and 
act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Foolish Ruse To Mislead Public Opinion'--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON in a 
commentary today denounces the United States which, displeased 
with the proposal and step of the DPRK for the establishment of 
a new peace arrangement, is alleging that the latter wrecked the 
Korean armistice agreement. 
  The analyst says: 
  The United States, far from accepting the DPRK's just 
proposal for ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, is crying 
over "the violation of the armistice agreement", taking issue 
with it. This is intended to cover up its crimes in having 
deliberately and systematically destroyed the Korean armistice 
agreement and armistice machine and shift the blame on to the 
other. 
  It is the United States that destroyed and scrapped the 
Korean Armistice Agreement. After it was signed in July 1953, 
the United States, a signatory to it, began violating it even 
before the ink on the agreement was dry. 
  The U.S. side had shipped new types of weapons including 
nuclear weapons into South Korea in secrecy by camouflaged 
method, afraid of the Korean Armistic Agreement in the past 
days. But now it is introducing and deploying them openly in 
broad daylight. 
  In March 1991 it was the United States that appointed a 
"general" of the South Korean army without legal authority or 
qualification in view of the Korean Armistice Agreement "senior 
member" of the U.S. side, thus incapacitating the armistice 
machine from fulfilling its function. 
  The U.S side's attempt to revive the armistice machine is 
intended to persist in war provocation moves and keep tensions 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States will be well advised to act with 
discretion, mindful that its perfidious act is not favourable to 
it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- South Korean youth and 
students waged anti-U.S. struggles in front of the "American 
Cultural Centres" in Taegu and Pusan, Seoul-based radio reports 
said. 
  Young people in Taegu Tuesday scattered copies of literature 
denouncing the United States for screwing up the situation of 
the Korean peninsula with nuclear pressure on the North, 
shouting anti- American slogans and pouring paint on the 
building of the "American cultural centre" in the city and a 
police post. 
  They accused the United States of driving South Korean 
agriculture into bankruptcy with pressure to open agricultural 
product market. 
  On the 15th, students under the Pusan-South Kyongsang 
Provincial Federation of General Student Councils staged a 
surprise demonstration in front of the "American Cultural 
Centre" in Pusan. 
  They occupied a road and condemned the United States for 
creating a war crisis, shouting "objection to the U.S. 
heightening tensions on the Korean peninsula" and other slogans. 
  In a statement they charged that the U.S. harms the peaceful 
atmosphere of the Korean peninsula, clamouring for 'sanctions' 
against the North with the approach of the 3rd round of North 
Korea- U.S. talks.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- Radio Voice of America 
Monday aired an article on the situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  The radio said that more than 40 years have passed since the 
Korean war ceased in July 1953, but huge Armed Forces of the 
belligerent parties are standing opposed to each other along the 
Military Demarcation Line on the Korean peninsula, with no peace 
agreement signed to completely end the state of war. 
  Noting that the international dispute over "full nuclear 
inspection" is facing the most grave crisis in which such a 
fabulous price as a second Korean war would have to be paid, the 
radio asked: Can the North Korean Army "be defeated" in this war? 
  Recalling that the United States has deployed Patriot 
missiles in South Korea and is reinforcing arms equipment of 
latest types and keeping the U.S. troops present in South Korea 
and the South Korean puppet army on the keen alert, the radio 
said: But we must remember that the Korean peninsula is not 
the Balkan peninsula and that, unlike Iraq, a vast desert area, 
80 percent of it is covered with mountains, and the North Korean 
Army the United States would deal with is a special army 
different from other adversaries in the past. 
  The radio said one must not forget that President Kim 
Il-song, the elder statesman who has dealt with the United 
States and Japan for a long time, and supreme commander of the 
Army Kim Chong-il lead the North Korean Armed Forces and people. 
  Noting that today the U.S. military is finding itself in the 
toughest spot over this problem, the radio said nobody has 
indicated a solution to it and days are going by in vexation.

  [Text] According to military sources, on 14 June the South 
Korean puppets committed a provocative act of illegally bringing 
recoilless guns into the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ]. 
  At around 09:15 [00:15 GMT] on 14 June, the puppet army's 
armed rascals brought in, and installed at an encampment, 90-mm 
recoilless guns inside the DMZ 600 meters south of the Military 
Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker No. 0412 in front of Kumsa-ri, 
Chorwon County. They took a firing position at our side, thereby 
gravely threatening the safety of our People's Army soldiers who 
were on routine duty at a guard post. 
  At around 08:40 [23:40 GMT] on the same day, a numerous 
number of the puppet army soldiers equipped with automatic 
weapons were inciting a war atmosphere while touring about this 
area by sneaking into the DMZ area southeast of the MDL Marker 
Nos. 0140 and 0170 in front of (?Mt. Taedok) in Changpung County 
on the western frontline and--prior to this, at around 07:50 
[22:50 GMT]--into the DMZ area south of the MDL Marker No. 0468 
in front of Mabang-ri, Chorwon County on the central front line. 
  This is the South Korean puppets' intentional and 
premeditated maneuverings aimed at artificially aggravating the 
situation inside the DMZ area on the MDL and arousing a 
North-South confrontation. 
  The South Korean puppets should profoundly consider the 
grave 
consequences the rascals will cause by their reckless 
provocative acts and should not do rash and thoughtless acts.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The puppets staged a 
large-scale "civilian defense training" all over South Korea 
Wednesday by mobilising a great number of people, according to 
radio reports from Seoul. 
  They kicked up a dust with training of taking shelter and 
training under simulated conditions of "chemical, biological and 
radioactive attack" under an imaginary "emergency state." 
  The South Korean bellicose elements blared that it was a 
training of taking shelter in the wartime "to be prepared 
against the situation caused by the 'nuclear issue' of the 
North." 
  Earlier, the puppets announced that a massive military 
exercise will be staged involving various means of war, with 6.5 
million men of the "civilian defense" forces and even U.S. 
troops present in South Korea participating in the training in 
the future. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are 
frequently staging war drills with increasing intensity, driving 
the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of 
strain. This indicates that their war hysterics to stifle the 
North has reached a very reckless stage.

  [Text] Timed to coincide with its attempt to further drive 
the situation on the Korean peninsula onto the brink of war with 
the U.S. imperialists by finding faults with our fictitious 
nuclear issue, the South Korean puppets staged a game with a 
large-scale civil defense drill across South Korea on 15 June by 
dragging out thousands of residents, according to radio reports 
from Seoul. 
  The puppets made a stir by blowing warning sirens at 1405 
all 
over places in South Korea and staging an evacuation drill 
preparing for all contingencies. In addition, the puppets ran 
amok in staging a drill simulating chemical, biological, and 
nuclear attacks in every place. 
  The South Korean warmongers incited war fever by babbling 
that the drill has been restored as a war time evacuation 
exercise to prepare for contingencies in the wake of the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  Prior to this, the puppets announced that in future drills, 
not only some 6.5 million reserve forces but also the U.S. 
Forces in South Korea will be mobilized and that it will wage a 
large-scale war exercise using various types of war equipment. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are 
continuously staging war exercises and increasing their degree 
by extremely heightening tension on the Korean peninsula. This 
shows that the rascals' war hysteria attempting to crush us has 
reached an extremely reckless stage.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Rash Act by War Maniacs"] </F>
  [Text] War preparations are being accelerated in a 
full-fledged manner in South Korea these days. They are making 
such rows as checking shelters everywhere and checking water 
pumping facilities. At the same time, they are conducting 
shelter-taking and fire-extinguishing exercises one after 
another. 
  Amid these rows, the puppets held the so-called 15th civil 
defense consultative meeting on 13 June. Repeating the 
stereotyped allegation of the North's so-called nuclear issue, 
they issued an instruction that the civil defense organization 
should be rechecked to prepare for an emergency, that the 
maintenance of the underground shelters, water-supply 
facilities, warning facilities, and emergency equipment should 
be completed by the end of this month. They also stated that 
they would expand the emergency summons exercise in order to 
ascertain the manpower to be mobilized in case of emergency. 
  In the meantime, a large-scale war exercise is being 
conducted in South Korea participated in by millions of civil 
defense unit members, puppet armed forces, and U.S. imperialist 
aggressor forces in South Korea. This is a phenomenon that one 
can see only on the eve of a war, and shows well how desperately 
the puppets are engaged in the maneuvers for a war of northward 
invasion. 
  The puppets rave that these war maneuvers are aimed at 
coping 
with someone's nuclear issue, but this is nothing but a 
sophistry to hide the danger of their maneuvers for a war of 
northward invasion. 
  The North's nuclear issue is the outcome of antisocialist, 
anti- DPRK maneuvers persistently pursued by the United States, 
and is a fiction invented to crush [apsal] our republic. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists are massively assembling 
the aggressor forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas 
under the pretext of the North's so-called development of 
nuclear weapons, raving that they have no alternative but to 
fight with us and that a preemptive attack on North Korea is an 
option. In so doing, the U.S. imperialists are watching 
thirstily for an opportunity to provoke a war. 
  Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam ring, the filthy war servant for 
the U.S. imperialists, not only placed the entire puppet armed 
forces in an emergency alert posture in order to put them into a 
war of northward invasion at any time, but is committed to a 
major suppression campaign against democratic forces, thus 
attempting to suppress and obliterate all the forces which stand 
in the way of their implementing the war policy. 
  The war preparation maneuvers being waged concurrently 
across 
South Korea show that the puppets are accelerating at a final 
stage the preparations for the provocation of the war of 
northward invasion which the puppets regard as a set course of 
action. 
  Moreover, not to be overlooked is the fact that the puppets 
are intensifying the so-called checking of shelters, rechecking 
of the civil defense organizations, and shelter-taking exercise 
at the same time when the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] adopted an absurd resolution on the suspension of the 
IAEA cooperation with our country and when the possibility of a 
UN sanction is being discussed. 
  In view of the international alliance which the puppets have 
pursued and the war preparations which they accelerated, we 
cannot but conclude that they are taking advantage of the 
present opportunity to light the fuse of a war of northward 
invasion. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is comprised of extremely vicious war 
fanatics who take no account of their fellow countrymen or the 
well-being of the nation. They are the filthy cat's paw of a war 
of the U.S. imperialists, and filthy and vicious national 
traitors. 
  Because of reckless war maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists 
and the puppet clique, an urgent situation is created now on the 
Korean peninsula in which a war could break out at any time, and 
the people of the world are expressing great worries over it. 
The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's war maneuvers are the foolish 
rash acts of those who lost reason and whose future is doomed. 
  We have already warned that there is no mercy in war. If the 
Kim Yong-sam ring undertakes the road of adventure by 
downgrading us, it will be their own destruction. The puppets 
should squarely see that all they gain from the war maneuvers is 
nothing but their own ruin, and they should act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Hanchongnyon Chairman Denounces Kim Yong-sam 'Regime' as </F>
Flunkeyist and Treacherous One" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Student Kim Hyon-chun, 
chairman of the second-term of the Federation of General Student 
Councils of South Korea, in an interview with HANGYORE SINMUN 
denounced the Kim Yong-sam "regime" as a flunkeyist and 
treacherous one. 
  In his interview he said it was proved that the present 
"regime" is a treacherous and flunkeyist "regime" which evaded a 
probe into the May 18 truth and opened rice market against the 
demand of the people over the last one year and coiled up 
tensions on the Korean peninsula with the introduction of 
Patriot missiles. 
  It is a judgement of Hanchongnyon that there is no need to 
expect from the Kim Yong-sam "regime" any longer, he said. 
  Touching on this year's reunification movement, he said that 
the federation would defend the principle of great national 
unity, demand the signing of a peace agreement and continue to 
maintain the keynote of the student movement in the 
reunification movement including a successful opening of the 
pan-national rally. 
  He demanded that the present "regime" renounce its 
anti-reunification attitude to suppress Hanchongnyon.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
North side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and 
Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) 
issued a statement to the press Tuesday denouncing the Japanese 
authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan. 
  He said that the raid on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters 
of Chongnyon by the Japanese police on June 6 was a downright 
expression of the Japanese authorities' heinous hostile policy 
toward the DPRK in collusion with the United States and the 
South Korean puppets. 
  The Japanese authorities are escalating crackdown on 
Chongnyon, talking about study of "measure for public peace at 
home" and establishment of "emergency security arrangements" he 
said, adding: 
  If the Japanese reactionaries think they can go scotfree 
after provoking Chongnyon, a dignified overseas citizens' 
organisation of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan with a futile 
design to realize the old dream of "greater East Asia 
coprosperity sphere", it would be a big mistake. 
  The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences 
of 
their anti-DPRK and anti-Chongnyon racket, immediately give up 
such moves and sincerely apologize for all the criminal acts 
they have committed up to now and punish the criminals. 
  The spokesman expressed the belief that the Korean youth and 
students at home and abroad under Pomchonghaknyon would actively 
turn out in a struggle to defend the democratic national rights 
of the Korean youth in Japan, our brothers and sisters, and the 
dignity of the homeland from the Japanese reactionaries' ever 
intensified fascist suppression.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Japanese people are 
denouncing the authorities' suppression of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  Hiromi Takahashi, representative member of the Edokawa Ward 
People's Society in Tokyo, Japan, for supporting the independent 
and peaceful reunification of Korea, charged that Japan has 
defined the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as "the 
enemy," fostering tension under the pretext of its "nuclear 
issue" and suppressing Chongnyon. 
  He urged the Japanese Government to take steps to prevent 
outrages against Koreans in Japan. Lawyer Takayuki Yoshida 
denounced the search of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of 
Chongnyon by the Japanese police and called for pooling strength 
in the struggle against "an emergency system" sought by the 
Japanese reactionary forces. 
  Takayoshi Yamanaka, vice-chairman of the All-Japan 
Federation 
of Peasants Unions, said though Japan must ask pardon of the 
Korean people for the issues of "comfort women for the Army" and 
forcible drafting, it is increasing tension in league with the 
United States and South Korea. 
  Warning that the suppression of Chongnyon today will reach 
the Japanese people tomorrow, he called for checking such 
fascist suppression.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held on 
June 15 at Changdok school, Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang 
Municipality, to welcome the delegation of Jilin Yuwen Middle 
School, China. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song conducted 
revolutionary activities, studying at Jilin Yuwen Middle School 
from January 1927 to Autumn of 1929. 
  Kang Chun-ho, principal of Changdok school said in his 
speech 
at the meeting that Jilin Yuwen Middle School with a long 
history is a proud school which actively struggled against the 
Japanese imperialist aggressors and reactionary warlords in the 
past and trained excellent revolutionaries of China in this 
course. The teachers and students of the school have better 
tended the statue of respected Comrade Kim Il-song erected at 
their school out of a noble desire to convey forever the undying 
revolutionary relics of Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of 
the Korean people, and develop the traditional Korea-China 
friendship down through generations, he said. 
  Zhao Zhongxin, secretary of the Party Committee of the 
school, who is heading the delegation, speaking next, referred 
to the fact that President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il 
sent precious gifts to the school several times with deep 
concdrn. He said that they consider the school a symbol of 
China-Korea friendship. 
  The friendship between Yuwen school and Changdok school is 
all the more precious because the two schools are the historical 
places where President Kim Il-song studied.

equipment 
has a wealth of precious experience in instruction and 
education, he laid stress on deepening friendship between the 
two schools.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Dangerous Military Action Aimed at Us"] </F>
  [Text] The recent situation surrounding the Korean 
peninsula is moving into an ill-boding direction with each 
passing day. As reported, the Rimpac military exercise 
participated in by the armed forces from the United States, 
Japan, and South Korea is being staged on the waters of the West 
Pacific Ocean close to our country, and this exercise which 
began at the end of May, will continue for 50 days until 
mid-July. 
  The exercise is being mobilized by the U.S. naval forces as 
its main force with some 60 additional naval ships and 200 
airplanes and vast forces of over 25,000 troops from 
participating nations. 
  Our attention is drawn to the fact that, for the first time 
in history, naval forces of the United States, Japan, and South 
Korea are staging joint operations and forming one single fleet. 
This is an intolerable, reckless, military action when 
considering the fact that the U.S. imperialists are perpetrating 
arms reinforcement maneuvers in South Korea under the pretext of 
so-called sanctions against us and laying the blame on the 
nonexistent nuclear issue. 
  The fact that the military bosses of the United States, 
Japan, and South Korea, who have been holding frequent 
conspiratorial conferences of aggression against us, have gone 
so far as to stage joint operations by organizing a joint naval 
fleet this time, vividly shows that the tripartite military 
alliance that was formed long ago with the United States as its 
main axis and with the aim of crushing our country and other 
socialist countries in Asia, has entered a practical stage. 
  Our people are watching with vigilance the U.S. 
imperialists' 
intention to persistently perpetrate the military action against 
our Republic through these joint operations that have become 
more unscrupulous, and strongly condemn the Rimpac-94 military 
exercise. 
  As reported, the DPRK Foreign Ministry, in its spokesman's 
press statement of 23 May regarding the recent moves of the 
situation surrounding the Korean peninsula in an ominous 
direction, called upon the United States not to cling to 
military action, but to respond to our peaceful initiatives. 
The dangerous military situation prevailing on the Korean 
peninsula and the area surrounding it, shows that our proposal 
for negotiations to establish a new solid peace-guarantee system 
which will replace the military armistice mechanism in our 
country, is correct and timely. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists are further expanding 
and 
strengthening military pressure on us through the Rimpac 
exercise in a bid to subdue us by force. 
  This is proven by the open remarks by an official of the 
Japan Defense Agency that the Rimpac-94 exercise is a political 
message to North Korea's nuclear program. 
  In particular, we cannot overlook the fact that the British 
paper SUNDAY TIMES of 5 June revealed that U.S. President 
Clinton was reviewing a plan to move the Rimpac military 
exercise site from the Pacific near Hawaii to the East Sea of 
North Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North Korea. 
  The U.S. imperialists are threatening and blackmailing us by 
mobilizing the multinational armed forces from Japan and South 
Korea. By so doing, the U.S. imperialists attempt to extremely 
aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and, thus, to 
invent an excuse for a military adventure against our Republic. 
  The U.S. imperialists will gain nothing from us through the 
Rimpac-94 exercises. The United States should not cling to the 
adventurous military action against us by mobilizing their 
follower countries, but should respond to our peaceful 
initiatives. 
  The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that any 
sanctions, 
pressure, or action for aggression does not work out in our 
Republic which treasures the country's sovereignty and the 
nation's dignity. They should behave with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Foreign newspapers 
strongly urged the United States and the South Korean 
authorities to pull down the concrete wall built by them in the 
area South of the Military Demarcation Line. 
  The Ghanaian paper GHANA TIMES said that the United States 
and the South Korean authorities have built the concrete wall 
for the purpose of perpetuating the division of Korea and 
blocking the people's movement for reunification. 
  The Dutch paper MANIFEST said that the South Korean 
authorities, instigated by the United States, have built the 
concrete wall under the pretext of preventing a fictitious 
"invasion from the North" and committed an anti-national crime 
to keep divided forever the Korean people who have lived as a 
homogeneous nation, boasting of the 5,000-year long history and 
brilliant culture. 
  The Indian magazine STUDENTS' FORUM said that with the 
concrete wall built the fellow countrymen in the North and the 
South are unable to freely come and go and inquire after the 
health of their families and relatives and overall opening in 
all realms of politics, the economy and culture between the 
North and the South is blocked. 
  The Peruvian paper LA REPUBLICA said that there is no wall 
in 
the area north of the Military Demarcation Line but wire 
entanglements marking the boundary line. It said that to pull 
down the concrete wall is the will of the Korean people and the 
requirement of the times and the preservation of the concrete 
wall is a shame of the nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article headlined "Glorious Course in Which Most 
Brilliant Era has Opened in Building of Our Party" on the lapse 
of 30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to 
work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK]. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has led the WPK over the past 30 years, 
taking upon himself the work of all domains of party building 
including the organisational, ideological and leadership 
departments. 
  The article says the history of his leadership over the 
party 
building is a history of unfailing loyalty in which he has 
firmly defended the lineage of the party established by the 
leader and glorified the party as a great revolutionary party, 
and a brilliant history in which he indicated the fundamental 
questions of the revolutionary party building with his 
extraordinary intelligence and comprehensively completed the 
theories of building of a working- class party in the present 
era. 
  The article goes on: 
  Expounded in the theories of the party building which have 
been historically developed by the dear leader in depth are all 
the principled questions of party building, including the basic 
principles of party building, the idea and theory of building 
the party in a prospective way, the guidelines for strengthening 
the party ranks organisationally and ideologically and 
intensifying the party's leadership over the revolution and 
construction, and the ways of achieving close unity with the 
masses. 
  The past 30 years of his leadership to our party is also a 
proud history in which he has fundamentally changed the looks of 
the party with his surprising organisational skill and 
leadership ability. 
  He has changed fundamentally in a historically short period 
all domains and units of the party work from the question of 
improving the party members' mode of thinking and style of work 
to the question of traits of cadres, from the intra-party 
affairs to the external activities of the party. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed immortal feats 
unprecedented in the history of the revolutionary party building 
in the course of his glorious 30 years of leadership to the work 
of our party. 
  The greatest feat performed by him in realizing the cause of 
building of our party is that he has laid solid organisational 
and ideological foundations for strengthening and developing the 
party into a revolutionary party of chuche united in one mind 
forever. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has said: 
  "The top echelon of the party has been built up, the 
organisational and ideological foundation of the party laid as 
firmly as a rock and its guidance system solidly established so 
as to carry on the ideas and leadership of our party. This is a 
brilliant success and a great victory in the building of our 
party." 
  A great victory worthy of special record in history has been 
won in the organisational and ideological building of our party 
under the guidance of the dear leader over the past 30 years. 
  In our party now, the ranks of cadres who constitute the 
backbone of its organisational and ideological foundation have 
been built with staunch revolutionaries who are sharing life and 
death with the party in any adversity. All our party members 
are vanguard fighters following the leader only with loyalty and 
filial piety. 
  In the aspect of ideological building, our party has become 
a 
pure ideological entity in which only one idea, the chuche idea, 
prevails. 
  Any heterogeneous idea or unsound trend contrary to the 
ideology and intentions of the leader cannot intrude into our 
party. 
  Great feats performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in the cause 
of 
building a revolutionary party of chuche also lie in that he has 
strengthened and developed our party into a powerful general 
staff of the revolution leading the revolutionary cause along an 
ever- victorious road with his invincible leadership ability. 
  In the course of his leadership of the cause of party 
building the party's leadership system has been established in 
our society on the highest level whereby to firmly ensure the 
party's leadership over all the domains and units of the 
revolution and construction. 
  Having strengthened and developed the party into an 
invincible revolutionary party linked to the masses by the 
strongest, close bonds of kinship is a great feat performed by 
Comrade Kim Chong-il in the cause of building the revolutionary 
party of chuche. 
  He has established throughout the party a revolutionary 
trait 
of working as demanded by the Chongsanri spirit and the 
Chongsanri method, thus turning the party into a revolutionary 
party always sharing the same destiny with the masses at all 
times in one lineage, a party without bureaucratism and abuse of 
power, for the first time in the history of the communist 
movement. 
  Having strengthened and developed the Workers' Party of 
Korea 
into indestructible militant ranks never seen before in the 
ideological and organisational aspects and in relations with the 
masses and set a model of the times in building a revolutionary 
party holds the most brilliant place in the revolutionary feats 
performed by the dear leader.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- A symposium in the 
domain of railways took place to mark the lapse of 30 years 
since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Speakers at the symposium noted that the dear leader 
regarded 
railway transport as a leading sector to which definite 
precedence over other branches of the national economy must be 
given and has led them to effect a signal change in their work. 
  They said an important feat performed by the dear leader in 
directing the work of railway transportation is that he defined 
"the drive for extra haulage on schedule without accident to 
implement the decision of the 18th plenary meeting of the 5th 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea" as a mass 
movement of loyalty which the railway workers should hold fast 
to and conduct vigorously, and led them to register brilliant 
successes in this movement. 
  Now, the railway transport domain, they said, has assumed 
its 
looks wonderfully as a pioneer of the national economy and is 
playing a big part in the transport of materials conducive to 
socialist economic construction.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Chang-kyun: "Global Food Shortage"] </F>
  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught as 
follows: 
  "The whole world is crying in distress because of the food 
crisis as numerous people are dying from starvation." 
  The current food situation is getting worse than ever 
before, 
causing dire social and political problems. 
  Statistics show that the world's grain output has diminished 
each year. In the past 8 years the world's per capita grain 
output has decreased by 8 percent on the average. It plummeted 
sharply last year in particular. According to an estimate by 
the UN Food and Agricultural Organization [FAO], the world's 
grain output in 1993 fell 3.5 percent from the 1992 level. 
  The drop in the grain output is not limited to any one 
country, region, or continent, but it is becoming a global 
phenomenon. 
  Last year the grain output fell sharply in major grain 
producing countries in particular. 
  In 1993 the U.S. corn output fell 54 million tons from the 
preceding year, and in Russia the grain output dropped by 6.8 
million tons in the same period. Japan's 1993 rice output was 
25 percent below the 1992 output, registering the lowest level 
since the end of World War II. In the Sevilla area in Spain the 
rice output dropped by one-third last year. 
  The situation in Africa is the same. Some African countries 
are producing only less than half of the amount of grain needed. 
  With the annual grain output diminishing each year, the 
world's total grain stock has shrunk to critical proportions. 
  The world's current food reserve is estimated at only 17 
percent of the total demand, the lowest point in 10 years. 
  The worldwide food shortage is creating a tragedy in which a 
countless number of people are dying from starvation. 
  Since early this year quite a few countries have asked for 
emergency food aid to tide over their food shortage. 
Reportedly, 46 countries currently need 4.5 million tons of 
food aid for their hungry children and women. 
  According to statistics, currently 1.5 billion people go 
hungry worldwide, and children suffering from malnutrition 
number 200 million. Each year more than 20 million people die 
from starvation. 
  In developing countries 550 million people are on the verge 
of starvation, the number of deaths from hunger reaching 
between 13 and 18 million. In Africa, 80 million people are in 
the immediate danger of starvation. One in every three Africans 
is suffering from malnutrition. 
  The hunger in capitalist countries is also serious. In the 
United States more than 30 million people go hungry. The number 
of hungry people is also increasing in the former Soviet Union 
now under capitalism and in East European countries as well. 
  The food shortage is causing social disorder and confusion, 
and even political crises, in a number of countries. 
  There are several reasons for the worsening food situation. 
  First, because of the inadequate soil conservation and 
management, a lot of farmland has been made unfit for farming 
or washed away by the floods. 
  Statistics show that in the past 10 years 150 million 
hectares of tropical forests have disappeared worldwide. This 
decrease in the forest acreage has caused a serious flood and 
drought damage and a massive washing away of arable land. Each 
year 6 million hectares of land is turning into a desert 
worldwide. 
  Each year 9 million hectares of arable land becomes unfit 
for 
farming because of the poor fertility of the soil. 
  Another reason for the diminishing grain output is the 
inadequate irrigation. 
  The total acreage of world's arable land is 1,475,420,000 
hectares. Of this total only 15 percent is under irrigation. 
The acreage under irrigation is less than 2 percent in the 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
  According to agricultural experts, water-related problems, 
such as drought, flood, and contaminated underground water, 
account for 80 percent of the damage to the growth of farm 
crops in developing countries. 
  Even a slight drought causes a serious damage to the crops 
in 
unirrigated areas and ruins the farming. In some parts of the 
Middle and Near East and Africa, the farm output has been 
minuscule because of the perennial drought. 
  Another reason for the failure to increase the farm output 
is 
related to the low level of scientific and technological 
knowledge of the rural population. 
  The question of boosting production depends in no small 
measure on the ability of the people directly involved. But in 
most countries in the world the general level of knowledge of 
the rural population is very low. There are 948 million 
illiterate adults worldwide, and most of them live in rural 
areas. 
  Incessant conflicts and armed clashes arising in many 
countries in the world are also causing serious losses to farm 
production. Numerous farmers abandon their devastated land to 
escape from the bloodshed, and a considerable acreage of 
farmland is diverted to the construction of military facilities. 
  There is a little prospect for improving the world food 
situation in the foreseeable future. The FAO warns that unless 
there is a drastic change in agricultural production, humanity 
would face a far more "serious food shortage" in the year 2000. 
  The current food crisis which is threatening the very 
existence of humanity must be overcome.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- A seminar of party 
cadres training centres was held here Tuesday on the lapse of 30 
years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work 
at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Speeches were made there on the subject "Holding in High 
Esteem the Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the Head of Our 
Party is a Great Historical Event Which Brought About a New 
Upswing in the Development of the Party and the Revolution" and 
other subjects. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has comprehensively completed and 
brilliantly applied the revolutionary theory and method 
including the chuche-based theory of the party building, thus 
victoriously leading the whole party and the entire people to 
the accomplishment of the socialist cause and performing the 
immortal feats for the party and revolution, the era and the 
history, the speakers said. 
  They noted that the feats performed by him in the work of 
training party cadres are that he has brought up cadres to be 
competent true leading men who have been tested politically and 
ideologically in a revolutionary way and prepared theoretically 
and practically and thus firmly built core elements to firmly 
defend and glorify the party, the revolution and the socialist 
system. 
  Today the socialism of our style is winning victory one 
after 
another and our party is displaying its invincible might, not 
wavering in any vicious anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists, the 
speakers pointed out, saying this is a clear demonstration of 
the greatness of the idea and the leadership of the dear leader. 
  Brilliant today and bright future of the party, the country 
and the people lie in holding him in high esteem at the head of 
the party and the revolution forever with loyalty and filial 
piety, the speakers stressed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea is preserving the revolutionary relics and 
remains as eternal wealth. 
  Recently the technical agency for the preservation of 
revolutionary sites manufactured a new fireproof and waterproof 
cloth and a glass cylinder, making it possible to permanently 
preserve historical mementoes, slogan-bearing trees, relics and 
remains of the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary 
struggle. 
  There are many revolutionary mementoes and remains in all 
parts of the country, especially in the area of Mt Paektu. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has long since made 
sure 
that the revolutionary relics and remains associated with the 
glorious revolutionary traditions of the Workers' Party of Korea 
were preserved well to be conveyed through generations. Saying 
the revolutionary slogan-bearing trees are wealth more precious 
than a thousand pieces of gold, he indicated the orientation and 
way of permanently preserving them in glass cylinders. 
  The officials and working people in charge of the 
preservation of revolutionary sites are building up the 
revolutionary battle sites and historical sites and preserving 
them well while discovering and arranging revolutionary 
historical materials and revolutionary mementoes. 
  Musums have been built in every place associated with the 
revolutionary traditions and relics and remains are preserved 
well in their original state. 
  Secret bases, slogan-bearing trees, relics and remains of 
the 
period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle are being discovered 
in large numbers through a vigorous unearthing of revolutionary 
relics. Entering the 90s alone, more than 11,650 slogan-bearing 
trees including those inscribed with the slogans "Let us uphold 
general Kim Il-song, the hero of the nation and great man of all 
people", "Woman general of Mt. Paektu Kim Chong-suk, woman 
general of the anti-Japanese war produced by Korea" and "The 
Paektu lodestar rose up above Mt. Paektu. It shines over three 
thousand-ri land", and new secret bases and many revolutionary 
relics and remains have been founded in Musan and Yonsa Counties 
of North Hamgyong Province and other places.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 15 
June was informed by the United States of North Korea's notice 
of withdrawal, and officially declared that North Korea was no 
longer a member state. 
  The United States, the trustee of the IAEA ratification 
treaty, delivered an official document to the IAEA Secretariat 
on 15 June which stated that North Korea was withdrawing from 
the IAEA. The official document received by the IAEA clearly 
points out that North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam 
officially notified the U.S. Government of the North Korean 
authorities' decision to withdraw from the IAEA as of 13 June. 
  With the receipt of the official document, the IAEA, as 
authorized by the United States which is the trustee country, 
declared that North Korea has given up its membership as of 13 
June and informed the 35 board of governor states and other 
member states. The IAEA reaffirmed, however, that North Korea's 
withdrawal of its member state status does not at all effect the 
nuclear security agreement signed between North Korea and the 
IAEA in 1991.

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea received the 
U.S.-drafted sanctions resolution on North Korea Wednesday and 
the president approved it, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said 
Thursday. 
  A unification and national security policy coordination 
meeting convened late Wednesday reviewed the draft received 
earlier in the day and agreed it was ready for United Nations 
consultations, he said. 
  "The draft, if adopted as it is, will be very effective, 
exerting great pressure on North Korea," Han said at a press 
conference. "It appropriately reflects the position of South 
Korea." 
  He predicted that it will take two to three weeks before the 
draft passes discussion within the Security Council and is 
finally adopted. 
  Meanwhile, he left the door open for dialogue with 
Pyongyang, 
saying it all depends on North Korea's attitude in the coming 
days. 
  "As we have said before, the purpose of the resolution is 
not 
sanctions themselves but to clear up the suspicion about North 
Korea's past nuclear activities and to secure nuclear 
transparency for the present," said Han. 
  "Before or even after the resolution is adopted, the door 
remains open for dialogue if North Korea carries out its 
obligations under the nuclear safeguards accord and cooperates 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," the foreign 
minister said. 
  The draft gives the communist state a 30-day grace period to 
unconditionally comply with the nuclear safeguards agreement and 
to implement the inter-Korean accord on denuclearization. 
  The U.S.-drafted resolution contains six points including a 
mandatory ban on weapons imports and exports, partial diplomatic 
sanctions, a ban on all flights except regular passenger 
services, and an embargo on any technological cooperation 
related to nuclear science. 
  These are the first-phase sanctions, he said, with 
second-phase action to include freezing funds remitted to North 
Korea, Han said. 
  The second-phase sanctions, including a freeze on all North 
Korean assets abroad, would be implemented immediately in the 
event of any negative behavior by Pyongyang such as withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said. 
  Asked about China's position on the draft, Han said it was 
probably given to Beijing late Wednesday and no reaction was yet 
forthcoming. 
  He suggested that the next phase of sanctions could well 
include a ban on China's crude oil supplies to its neighbor and 
traditional ally North Korea, saying "a number of stringent 
actions can be included." 
  "The resolution outlines clearly the conditions under which 
the sanctions will be abandoned before implementation and the 
conditions under which the sanctions will be stopped after 
implementation begins," Han explained. 
  "Whether these conditions have been met sufficiently for the 
involved parties to engage in dialogue, the judgement of the 
IAEA is crucial," he said, suggesting that North Korea will have 
to negotiate with the U.N. nuclear agency to defuse the problem. 
  The North announced earlier this week that it was quitting 
the IAEA in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions 
resolution on Pyongyang. 
  The foreign minister did not go into detail about specific 
means of South Korean participation in the sanctions, although 
the first- phase U.N. measures include suspension of bilateral 
and multilateral development assistance. 
  "If the sanctions go into effect, there will be much for us 
to do both bilaterally and multilaterally," said Han. 
  He indicated negotiations have been held on what to do about 
inter-Korean trade activities at this point, saying "The 
government does have thoughts on this issue." 
  "But the focus now is on U.N. measures. It would be improper 
to say what the thoughts are at this point," said Han.

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- Scores of representatives 
from the opposition camp and the academic and social circles 
said Thursday they would oppose punitive sanctions against North 
Korea for purposes other than securing nuclear transparency, 
even if such sanctions were contained in a U.N. resolution. 
  During a press conference at a Seoul hotel, 59 major 
opposition figures said in a joint statement that the North 
Korean nuclear problem should be solved peacefully through the 
basic South-North agreement and the joint declaration on 
denuclearization of Korean peninsula. 
  Among the participants were Rep. Yi Ki-taek, leader of the 
main opposition Democratic Party, YMCA Secretary-general Kang 
Mun-kyu, the Rev. Kim Kwan-sok and Chosun University President 
Yi Ton-myong. 
  They called on the U.S. Government to hold a third round of 
talks with North Korea for a package deal to settle the nuclear 
problem, also urging the South Korean Government to solve the 
issue through dialogue with the North. 
  "The most serious thing we are worrying about right now is 
the thought and action behind solving the nuclear row through 
sanctions," they said, emphasizing their opposition to sanctions 
by only South Korea, the United States and Japan or by the 
Americans alone. 
  They pointed out that the Korean people's survival is 
threatened by the vicious cycle of sanctions, repercussions and 
strong countermeasures without the principle of compromise and 
dialogue. 
  Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party convened a 
meeting of postholders to discuss the joint statement and urged 
DP leader Yi to reconsider his position on the nuclear issue. 
  DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin refuted their views on the crisis 
of the Korean peninsula as "dangerous logic justifying North 
Korea's nuclear weapons development in a tacit gesture."

<F P=106> [By Chong Pyong-chin] </F>
  [Text] North Korea conveyed to the United States a 
document on its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] on 15 June. On the same day, the United States 
completed its draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea 
to be presented to the UN Security Council. The situation with 
regard to the North Korean nuclear issue has become increasingly 
strained. 
  From the viewpoint that the coordination of opinion between 
the ROK and the United States is more important than ever under 
this situation, the government let all communication channels 
between Washington and Seoul, and between the United Nations and 
the Foreign Ministry become wide open. As long as our 
government, which is one of the parties most directly concerned 
with the North Korean nuclear issue, remains as a third party in 
negotiations on the nuclear issue, the United States, a party 
concerned with the negotiations, is sitting face to face with 
North Korea in the place of our government while negotiating 
with it on behalf of the United Nations and the IAEA which 
represent the international community. 
  Nevertheless, some people's criticism is that the United 
States shows an attitude of dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue as a line in the chain of its own diplomatic 
policy, and our government is not effectively responding to the 
U.S. policy of approach toward the issue. As the North Korean 
nuclear issue has lately brought about an excessive "sense of 
simulated crisis [kasangjok wigigam]" on the Korean peninsula, 
the aged doubt [haemugun pulsingam] that "the United States has 
a passive opinion [sogukchogin kyonhae] on tensions on the 
Korean peninsula because it wants to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue in its own way" seems to be raised again. In 
short, people note that the ROK and the United States have yet 
to build a belt of consensus in which they can share even 
specific interests [kuchejogin ihaekkaji kongyuhanun 
konggamdaega hyongsongdoeji anko itta]. 
  It is learned that the ROK and the United States have a good 
system for pre- or post-coordination of their opinion and that 
there is a relatively wide belt of consensus between the two. 
Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Bill Clinton have held talks over 
the telephone at every critical stage for every important issue. 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher have also held frequent talks in person or 
over telephone. In addition, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun has 
paved way for pictorial cooperation between the two countries by 
visiting the United States, and Robert Gallucci, U.S. ambassador 
in charge of the North Korean nuclear issue, will visit our 
country and Japan in the near future to round off the 
cooperation system between the ROK, the United States, and Japan. 
  On the other hand, however, some people note that "the two 
countries have held frequent talks for coordination of opinion 
but seem to have failed to reach a complete agreement to share 
even interests." 
  When North Korea declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, the 
United States, a suzerain state of the agency, branded [kyujong] 
North Korea's attitude as "an unforgivable act against the 
international community," and some U.S. sections made without 
hesitation such strong utterances as "they would not hesitate in 
imposing even military sanctions." Meanwhile, our government 
held an emergency meeting on measures against North Korea's 
declaration. However, it said "it would adhere to its original 
policy of using both dialogue and sanctions." Yi Hong-ku, 
deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification 
Board, who presided over the meeting, made it clear that "UN 
sanctions will be sanctions for dialogue." These facts cause us 
to assume that the ROK and the United States have a different 
awareness of the crisis on the Korean peninsula. 
  There have been more contradictions in cooperation between 
the ROK, the United States, and Japan. When Ambassador Kim 
Sam-hun visited the United States and held working-level talks 
with the United States and Japan, he said "the three countries 
are cooperatively coping with the North Korean nuclear issue." 
However, when faced with the unexpected variable of North 
Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, they showed wavering attitudes 
in reaching agreements and coordinating opinions. A ranking 
official of our government prospected, "This fact [North Korea's 
withdrawal from the IAEA] will not influence UN sanctions 
against North Korea and, accordingly, it will take two or three 
weeks, as scheduled, for the UN Security Council to formally 
discuss sanctions against the North." The United States, 
however, immediately prepared a draft resolution on sanctions 
against the North and opened it to public on the following day. 
They differed from each other in way of understanding the 
matter. 
  In addition to the withdrawal from the IAEA, North Korea has 
begun to show another card, that is, the withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Situation will all the more 
require the partnership among the ROK, the United States, and 
Japan, particularly between the ROK and the United States, in 
coping with the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] The government decided to support the resolution 
calling for sanctions against the North which was drafted by the 
United States and which is being discussed among the UN Security 
Council member states, and to maintain close cooperation with 
friendly countries for the passage of the resolution through the 
United Nations. This decision was made at a meeting of the 
unification and security-related ministers after they were 
informed by the United States yesterday of the draft resolution 
on sanctions against the North. 
  In this connection, a responsible Foreign Ministry official 
said that ample discussion was held with our government prior to 
the U.S. draft of the resolution calling for sanctions against 
the North which stipulates an arms embargo and a one-month grace 
period and that it thus well reflects our government's position. 
  The Foreign Ministry official said that because former U.S. 
President Carter made clear in his remarks that North Korean 
nuclear transparency was the premise for normalization of 
U.S.-North Korean relations, this does not significantly deviate 
from the basic policy of the ROK and the United States to solve 
the North Korean nuclear problem thoroughly and comprehensively.

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- A majority of South 
Korean scholars with doctoral degrees believe that North Korea 
has brought on the nuclear dispute in order to wiggle out of its 
economic difficulties. 
  In a survey conducted by the Seoul Research Center, more 
than 
half (50.5 percent) of 182 scholars polled said Pyongyang 
started the nuclear row to obtain U.S. economic aid. 
  Some 20.3 percent said North Korean leaders caused the 
nuclear standoff to quell economic and social instability in 
their country. 
  The survey was conducted May 14-15 on sociologists, 
political 
scientists, nuclear and other scientists. The margin of error 
was not disclosed. 
  According to 10.4 percent of the pollees, Pyongyang raised 
the nuclear issue as a means of defending itself against the 
joint U.S.- South Korean annual military exercise "Team Spirit." 
Some 17 percent viewed the nuclear row as preparations for war. 
  Asked about their sense of danger, 27.4 percent said they 
felt none at all, 32.4 percent said a little and 23.6 percent 
replied they felt more or less in peril and worried about the 
situation. 
  Some 11.5 percent said they felt at considerable danger but 
there was no way of preparing while only 4.9 percent said they 
sensed a lot of danger and were preparing for it. 
  Meanwhile, 56.5 percent said they believe North Korea 
already 
has nuclear bombs and will make more while 41.7 percent think 
Pyongyang has the capability but has not yet made any. 
  Commenting on former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to 
Pyongyang, 39.5 percent expect a temporary effect, 27.4 percent 
said Carter could not make any strong demands of North Korean 
President Kim Il-song because he is visiting in a private 
capacity, and 22.5 percent expected a slight achievement from 
carter's visit although they felt it was undesirable for a 
former American leader to get involved. 
  Only 5.4 percent said they thought Carter's visit would be 
an 
effective method of resolving the issue and 4.9 percent said 
there would be no result at all. 
  With regard to North Korea's withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, 43.9 percent said it was a 
North Korean plot to induce U.S. economic aid while hiding its 
nuclear capability under a shroud. 
  However, 28.5 percent said Pyongyang decided to quit the 
IAEA 
as a result of the international community's bid to impose 
sanctions on it. That's why the United States should withdraw a 
draft resolution on sanctions and induce Pyongyang back to the 
negotiating table, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 (YONHAP) -- North Korea plans to move 
the Japanese wives of Korean men in the North to near the 
Yongbyon nuclear estate for use as a "human shield" against 
possible attack by the United States, a leading Japanese weekly, 
SHUKAN BUNSHUN, reported in its latest June 23 issue. 
  The weekly said the Japanese wives of those Korean men 
repatriated from Japan to North Korea in the late 1950s are 
officially estimated at 1,831 but their number would actually 
run to thousands. 
  The report said it had obtained the information that some 
Japanese women in North Korea flashed an "SOS" to Japanese 
authorities, saying "we are about to be sent to an area near 
nuclear facilities." 
  "If this is true, Pyongyang apparently intends to use the 
Japanese wives as a human shield against possible U.S. attack on 
nuclear facilities," a Japanese Defense Agency official was 
quoted by the weekly as saying. 
  "This could also be a blackmail or retaliation against the 
Japanese Government moving to join international sanctions 
against North Korea over the nuclear question."

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- A 36-year-old North 
Korean arrived at Kimpo airport Thursday, months after defecting 
to a third country to seek asylum in the South, the Agency for 
National Security Planning (NSP) said. 
  Chin Kwang-ho, born to an ethnic Korean family repatriated 
to 
the North from Japan, was working as a driver at a supply base 
in a North Korean military academy when he defected in early 
February, according to the NSP. 
  Grievances over the severe discrimination against Koreans 
repatriated to the North from Japan drove Chin to flee, the 
agency said. 
  The South Korean Government decided to accept him from a 
humanitarian point of view. 
  Chin has a mother and an elder sister still living in North 
Korea, the NSP said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- North Korean lumberjacks 
at Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia toil up to 22 hours a 
day under sub-human working and living conditions, it was 
revealed Tuesday. 
  Six North Korean loggers, who earlier fled the camps and 
then 
resettled in South Korea last month, told a joint news 
conference at the Press Center that camp working hours usually 
run about 16 hours and sometimes up to 22 hours a day. 
  In addition to the long hours, most of the lumberjacks are 
not fed properly and many cannot work because of extreme hunger, 
they added. 
  The six are Choe Chong-nam, 36, Kim Sung-chol, 33, Kim 
Tong-un, 35, Paek Ho-chol, 28, Won Yu-nam, 25, and Chang Il-un, 
30. They have resettled in the South after arriving in Seoul 
May 18 from a third country. 
  "Food was not supplied properly and there were cases where 
some lumberjacks had to catch rats or frogs and eat them," said 
Kim Tong-un. 
  "But they could not complain about the inhuman conditions 
because, if they did, they would be prosecuted as political 
criminals," he said. 
  A lumberjack can make up to 100 won to 130 won (50 to 65 
U.S. 
dollars) a month. But workers receive such maximum pay only 
about two months out of the year, Kim Sung-chol said. Wages 
come to much less during the rest of the year. 
  Pay is halved by the time it reaches the individual worker's 
pocket when deductions are made for such necessities as meals 
and equipment, he said. 
  Nevertheless, jobs at Siberian logging camps are difficult 
to 
land in North Korea because there are too many people who want 
to work there despite the harsh conditions, Won Yu-nam said. 
  Won said North Korea sent only convicted criminals to 
Siberian logging camps before the collapse of communism in the 
Soviet Union and East European countries in 1989. 
  Since then, however, Pyongyang has sent only workers with 
clean personal backgrounds, he said. 
  Commenting on their motive for escaping from the camps, Choe 
Chong-nam said that since he did not have enough money on which 
to live in Russia, he traded in Chinese and South Korean goods 
to make money on the side. 
  "But a party functionary found out and demanded a payoff 
from 
me," he said, explaining that was the direct reason for his 
escape. 
  Choe said he lived with an ethnic Korean family for a while 
but decided to resettle in South Korea as North Korean agents 
were doggedly pursuing him. 
  He said he did not know much about South Korea but in the 
process of selling South Korean goods, he found out about life 
in the South bit by bit. 
  Choe explained that he also listened to South Korean radio 
broadcasts and realized that South Koreans have much higher 
living standards than people in the North. 
  Kim Tong-un said that after fleeing, he hesitated for some 
time before deciding to resettle in the South. He said he was 
worried that his family would have to suffer because of him. 
  The former loggers said they could not disclose the details 
of how they escaped from the camps and wandered across vast 
areas of Russia because there are still many other fleeing North 
Korean lumberjacks hoping to resettle in the South.

  [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry will 
make public parts of the Korean war (1950-1953) documents 
received from Russia on June 25, officials said Saturday. The 
documents are being translated into Korean by Foreign Ministry 
officials and staff at the South Korean Embassy in Russia, they 
said. 
  "The documents include telegraph messages between Kim 
Il-song 
and Joseph Stalin. They can substantially prove North Korea 
made the first provocation against South Korea," said one 
official, "Once the papers are translated, they will carry much, 
much value." North Korean still insists that Seoul made the 
first attack. 
  Russia gave South Korean President Kim Yong-sam the war 
documents when the latter visited Moscow last week. The bundle 
contains over 600 pages of over 200 items including 
communication North Korea had with the former Soviet Union and 
China from January 1949 to October 1950. For example, the 
materials show Kim Il-song requested Moscow's support for the 
war in January 1950 and Stalin agreed the following month. They 
include an attack plan prepared by Russian military officials in 
May 1950 and the kind of weapons Soviets supplied to North Korea 
between September 1949 and April 1950. 
  Officials said the original papers will be kept by the 
government and sensitive materials will be kept confidential.

  [Text] It has been revealed that the five North Koreans 
who were recently deported from Russia for attempting to obtain 
nuclear materials [haek mulchil] were diplomats. 
  (Basilev), spokesman for the Counter-Intelligence

North Koreans who tried to obtain materials [mulchil] for use in 
manufacturing nuclear weapons were designated as figures to be 
avoided [kipi inmul], that is, unwelcome diplomats in the 
country where they work, and were deported from Russia in the

  [Text] Regarding our country's media reports that China 
will provide military assistance to North Korea in case a 
military collision breaks out on the Korean peninsula, a 
spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied such reports, 
reported ITAR-TASS in a Beijing-dispatched story. 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a telephone 
interview with ITAR-TASS, strongly denied such reports by saying 
that the reports are a absolutely groundless fiction [chonjoguro 
ssulttae omnun hogurago]. 
  The news agency reported that the spokesman, however, kept 
silent on reports that a close woman relative of North Korean 
President Kim Il-song visited Beijing at the end of May and 
agreed with the Chinese side to receive food and energy if 
economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Choe Won-sok] </F>
  [Text] Korea and China agreed yesterday to set up four 
subcommittees to strengthen industrial alliances in the fields 
of automobiles, aircraft, time division exchanges (TDX) and high 
definition TVs (HDTV). 
  The four subpanels will hold their inaugural meetings in 
September but the venues have yet to be decided. 
  The agreement was reached in the inaugural meeting of the 
Korea- China Industrial Cooperation Committee held at the 
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy in the Kwachon government 
office complex. 
  Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Kim Chol-su led a 31- 
member Korean team to the conference, while Wang Zhongyu, 
Chinese minister of State Economic and Trade Commission, headed 
his country's 36-member delegation. 
  Industrial cooperation in the four areas was initially 
agreed 
on in the summit talks between President Kim Yong-sam and 
Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng held in Beijing in March. At the 
summits it was also decided to set up the Korea-China Industrial 
Cooperation Committee. 
  As for cooperation in cars, the two ministers agreed to 
focus 
efforts on automotive parts for the time being. 
  In particular, China requested Korean investment in its 
development of 30 kind of automotive parts. 
  On the list are fuel and ignition systems, pistons, filters, 
drum brakes, steering systems, shock absorbers, air conditioner 
compressors, air bags, door locks, motors, auto lamps and 
special bearings. 
  In the field of TDX digital switching systems, the two 
ministers concurred on the necessity of expanding the Chinese 
communications network through a Korean-Chinese joint venture in 
Shandong which is now manufacturing small-sized systems capable 
of handling 2,000-3,000 phone lines. 
  Wang promised that his country will help Korean companies 
take part in the construction of a communications network in the 
province of Hunan. 
  In the case of aircraft, the two ministers agreed to equally 
share expenses in the development and manufacture of 
medium-sized planes with some 100 seats in accordance with a 
memorandum on bilateral cooperation in the development of 
commercial aircraft signed in Seoul June 6. 
  Korea and China will consider allowing third countries to 
take part in the project in case they have high tech which is 
not available to them. 
  The two countries will jointly conduct a market survey as 
soon as possible to choose an appropriate model to be developed. 
  With regards to HDTVs, the two ministers agreed in principle 
to jointly develop and manufacture them. 
  But they decided to collaborate from the research stage over 
what type of HDTVs they will develop as the world is still 
undecided about type. 
  To substantiate cooperation, Korean and Chinese HDTV experts 
will gather in a workshop to be held in October, probably in 
Seoul. 
  In the meantime, Korea and China agreed to pursue industrial 
alliances in natural resources and electricity in additions to 
the four areas and expand exchanges of industrial specialists as 
well.

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has been 
invited to a summit of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) opening in Budapest this December, 
the Foreign Ministry announced Thursday. 
  Ministry officials said it has yet to be decided whether 
President Kim Yong-sam will attend the summit. 
  A senior CSCE officials' committee in Prague Wednesday 
unanimously approved inviting South Korea to attend and make a 
contribution, the ministry said. 
  The summit is scheduled for Dec. 5-6 in Budapest. 
  South Korea is the second non-member to be invited to a 
conference meeting after Japan, which participated in the 
Helsinki summit in 1992. 
  The 52-member CSCE does not hold annual summits, but 
officials here predicted that the top-level conference will 
eventually be regularized. 
  Seoul is a strong advocate of creating a regional security 
dialogue forum in Northeast Asia, and taking part in the CSCE 
meeting will provide know-how on the mechanisms and operation of 
such dialogue, ministry officials said.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Min-pae: "Why Does the Democratic Liberal </F>
Party Call For Reconsideration of the Denuclearization 
Declaration on the Korean Peninsula?"] 
  [Text] In a statement released during a meeting of its 
lawmakers and district chapter chairmen on 15 June, the 
Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] demanded that "the government 
reconsider the denuclearization declaration on the Korean 
peninsula." This attracts the people's attention. 
  The DLP, as a ruling party, has called upon the government 
to 
reconsider the denuclearization declaration on the Korean 
peninsula "only if it is not observed." It is very significant, 
because the DLP, of the same family of the government, has urged 
it to reconsider the declaration and to independently formulate 
steps to deal with it. 
  This is not the first time the DLP has made such remarks. 
Figures -- who believed that to play the game with Kim Il-song, 
an atmosphere for negotiations will never be created if North 
Korea is not cornered -- have demanded that the North-South 
denuclearization declaration be reconsidered. During a 
parliamentary inquiry in the meeting of National Assembly 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yi Se-ki, chairman of the 
party Policy Committee, and lawmakers Hwang Myong-su and Pak 
Chong-su have also called for its reconsideration. Many 
lawmakers seem to have the same feeling as the above-mentioned 
lawmakers. 
  The reconsideration of the denuclearization declaration 
means 
the revision of "the denuclearization declaration on the Korean 
peninsula" agreed upon by the North and South during talks in 
Panmunjom on 31 December 1991. We have observed this agreement, 
while North Korea has ignored it by maintaining a radiochemical 
laboratory in Yongbyon and extracting plutonium from there. They 
ask: How can South Korea abide by it under these circumstances? 
North Korea consistently moves forward with its nuclear 
development program, while the denuclearization declaration on 
the Korean peninsula has only fettered our nuclear sovereignty 
[haekchugwon]. They said, therefore, that its reconsideration is 
indispensable. 
  The government's official position regarding this is that 
"the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula must 
be maintained." During a parliamentary inquiry last year, 
Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung hinted at the 
possibility of its reconsideration. He was criticized by people 
after he made such remarks and, thereby, retracted them. If the 
government officially decides on its position regarding the need 
for its reconsideration, it will face difficulties in urging 
North Korea to abandon its nuclear development program, as well 
as to accept nuclear inspections. Also, big problems can be 
created in relations with the United States, which has pursued 
the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula. 
  Then, why does the DLP call for it? The figures who have 
called for its reconsideration said: "This is because we can 
effectively use the card, the reconsideration of the 
denuclearization declaration, to exert more pressure against 
North Korea in dealing with Kim Il-song." In other words, this 
is another card to induce North Korea to the negotiations table. 
  Along with this, the DLP demand includes a message to the 
United States.

<F P=106> [By MUNHWA ILBO reporter Kim Chae-mok] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Assuming his post with the 
birth of the Kim Yong-sam administration, Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu faced his greatest challenge as minister from the 
middle of last March through early April. To put it more 
precisely, from 17 through 31 March, when the results of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nuclear inspection 
of North Korea [NK] were officially announced to be 
"unsatisfactory," and when the United Nation's Security Council, 
with China participating, adopted a statement on the NK nuclear 
issue, Minister Han truly seemed to be treading on thin ice. It 
was not difficult to read the sense of crisis from his facial 
expressions and manner of speech. [passage omitted] 
  On 17 March, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] [passage 
omitted] reiterated its established position, "If NK 
satisfactorily accepts IAEA nuclear inspections--an item in its 
agreement with the United States, and if there is progress in 
working-level contact for a North-South exchange of special 
envoys, the opening of a third round of U.S.-NK talks could be 
realized. However, if there is no change in the NK attitude, the 
South Korea [SK]-U.S. response cannot help but enter into a "new 
stage." Here, of course, a new stage of the NK nuclear issue 
refers to a situation in which hard-line actions, such as 
referring the NK nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, would 
be taken. 
  However, this MOFA position seemed to disappear with one 
"hard-line" statement given on this day at 5:00 PM by Kim 
Sam-hun, Ambassador for Nuclear Affairs. "As for the government, 
it has worked with a fundamental objective of resolving the NK 
nuclear issue through dialog. However, NK refused inspection of 
indoor nuclear facilities at its Yongbyon radiochemical 
laboratory, despite its agreement on February 15th with the IAEA 
on inspection scope and procedures," said Ambassador Kim in a 
press conference he called. "We now have strong doubts about 
whether to continue efforts to resolve the problem through 
dialog," Kim continued, "I have made clear the position that if 
efforts at dialog fail repeatedly in the future, `all possible 
alternatives' would be considered." And he said that "we are 
asking ourselves maybe that time has come." Thus he repeatedly 
made strong statements, signifying things were entering into a 
stage in which sanctions would be taken, such as referring the 
issue to the United nation's Security Council [UNSC]. 
  Of course, these strong statements by Ambassador Kim were 
not 
his own decision. In a meeting with reporters on same day at 
about 9:40 PM, he showed a calm position, "there has been no 
change in our principal position, that we will continue to have 
dialog as long as possible, but if things don't work out in 
spite of this, we will have no choice but to enter a new stage, 
such as referring the issue to the UNSC. We will be watching the 
outcome of the special session of the IAEA Board of Governors 
scheduled for March 21st." 
  Then, who caused this "sudden change" in our position? 
Primarily, it was Kim's direct superior, Minister Han 
Sung-chu--Ambassador Kim also plays the role of special aid to 
Minister Han. Han seemed to be the person who put the final 
touches on Kim's statement, then why did Han give Kim such 
instructions to change it for the press conference? This leaves 
us with the question: who was it that moved Minister Han? 
  At about 3:00 PM on this day, Minister Han had a phone 
conversation with chief of Blue House [Presidential office] 
Secreatry for Foreign and National Security, Chong Chong-uk. 
Originally, Chief Chong had visited the Unification Board at 
about 11:00 AM, and immediately after a meeting with Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok tried to meet with Minister Han. At 
that time, however, Han was in the middle of a meeting with U.S. 
Deputy Defense Secretary Weisner. Failing to meet Minister Han, 
Chief Chong conveyed the Blue House's position with a telephone 
call. "The content of the Foreign Ministry statement is too 
weak. In the present circumstances, isn't a stronger message to 
NK needed? I think it would be good for the minister to hold a 
press conference directly and show a strong response," requested 
Chief Chong. It has not been confirmed whether Chief Chong 
stressed that this position was the intention of President Kim 
Yong-sam. It is not difficult to surmise that Minister Han did 
not feel good about Chong's statement. Afterwards, it has been 
said that, as if judging that he could not opposed the will of 
the Blue House head on, Minister Han called on Ambassador Kim 
Sam-hun and had him hold the press conference in his place. 
Ultimately, the hard-line mood of Chief Chong and others in the 
Blue House was the source of this day's "mixed-up announcement" 
by the Foreign Ministry. 
  Here, some in the media, such as the "Chosun Ilbo," through 
editorials, etc., in their 18 March edition characterized the 
Han-centered nuclear diplomacy of the last year as a failure, 
even calling for the complete replacement of the 
nuclear-diplomacy team. 
  With the situation like this, it appears Minister Han could 
not help but be tense. As if having reached some decision, 
Minister Han sent notification to the press center through a 
spokesperson that he would be holding a press conference on the 
afternoon of the 18th. For informal press-conference-type 
meetings between the foreign minister and reporters, 
notification was normally given at least one or two days in 
advance. So as news of the Han press conference on this day 
become know immediately after lunch, the press room suddenly 
grew tense. Stories even went out that Minister Han might be 
going to express an intention to take responsibility and resign. 
The reporters moved busily, preparing against all possible 
situations, such as reporting to their main offices and calling 
for camera crews. 
  However, going to the press room at about 2:20 PM, as soon 
as 
Minister Han took his seat, he began the session with a "pointed 
joke," "My first reason for meeting with you today is to show 
you that I still have my job." [passage omitted] The stress in 
his face was so clear as to give one a sense of tragic heroism, 
even the reporters listened somberly." Han said "the present 
situation of the NK nuclear issue are as we had original thought 
out in our road map. It will be fortunate if it is resolved 
well, but we have already clarified repeatedly that if it is 
not, we would show a new response. It is a fact of which we have 
also notified the other side, NK. The question is whether this 
is the time for a new response. That right now is not the moment 
is the only thing that is clear. However, with an understanding 
that the time is drawing near, there was a need to give a 
stronger response." Up to this point, he sound as if he were 
rationalizing the strong-response policy, such as referring the 
issue to the Security Council, elucidate the day before by 
Ambassador Kim on his orders. 
  However, the words Minister Han really wanted to say 
continued at the end. "It is true we were unable to realize the 
objective of our road map of `resolving the NK nuclear issue.' 
However, for the next objective (economic sanctions) we must get 
the support of China and other member nations of the Security 
Council. We needed to show the IAEA as well as China and other 
members of the Security Council that we have exhausted all 
possible means of dialog." This was a strong objection to the 
criticism of some concerning Minister Han, that, although 
efforts at dialog brought no resolution of the nuclear issue, 
his diplomacy was not one producing "no real results," in a 
word, that it was not the mere extension of a meaningless 
nuclear diplomacy his critics claim it to be. Negotiation and 
dialog are needed for the peaceful resolution of the nuclear 
issue, and if a peaceful resolution should fail, then dialog 
will also be needed for a coercive resolution through the 
sanctions of the international community against NK, he says. To 
put it another way, dialog, while a means of peaceful 
resolution, is at the same time a lever for acquiring a 
justification in preparation against the event there is no 
change in the NK attitude. 
  Minister Han's opinions continued. "NK has been earning 
time, 
but in the last year or so, has it obtained money or oil?" he 
countered, stating bluntly, "U.S. satellite intelligence, the 
analysis of the IAEA inspection team, Deputy Defense Secretary 
Weisner whom I had a meeting yesterday, and U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher with whom I spoke on the phone, all agree that 
there is no clear evidence that NK improved its 
nuclear-development technology or made new attempts at 
developing nuclear [weapons] during the last year or so, nor 
does it appear that they did." During the last year or so, NK 
probably only gained a more severe sense of isolation from the 
international community, he added. 
  Minister Han continued, "We must question whether, apart 
from 
`continuing dialog and turning the issue over to the UNSC when 
this does not work,' there could have been other methods we 
could have used for resolving the NK nuclear issue during the 
last year or so." "The trend of the times is to immediately draw 
hasty conclusions about success and failure. But there can be 
some problems which cannot be solved, no matter who adopts what 
means. The NK nuclear issue is just such a problem," he stressed 
strongly. 
  Given the mood of the IAEA, referral of the NK nuclear issue 
to the UNSC is now unavoidable; this is a movement of the 
international community which we cannot stop, concluded Han. 
However, he also pointed out in detail the dangers of the 
materialization of UNSC sanctions. In the event the UNSC decides 
on sanctions, any form of NK nuclear inspection whatsoever will 
become unlikely; it is unknown when and in what form 
unpredictable NK might take some unexpected actions; 
negotiations and dialog would be cut off; and it is inevitable 
that the initiative of both SK and the U.S. concerning the NK 
nuclear issue would be comparatively reduced. "Resolution of 
the NK nuclear issue is in stopping in advance the possibility 
of a NK provocation, which might take place five to ten years 
from now. It's not like Hitler's armies are going to be invading 
now," he said, asking, "Is there really a need for us to incite 
the provocation of NK?" 
  These ideas of Minister Han have the character of a 
refutation of the criticism of some that the NK nuclear issue 
should have been referred to the Security Council earlier, and 
at the same time seem to be saying that efforts at finding a 
solution through dialog must be continued in the early stages 
after the issue is handed over to the UNSC and before concrete 
sanctions are adopted. 
  His ideas of resolution through dialog were repeatedly 
stressed even on March 22nd, the day after the IAEA Board of 
Governors decided to refer the issue to the Security Council. 
Saying, "The Security Council's NK sanctions or resolution 
calling for inspections are, on the one hand, for pressuring NK 
into accepting nuclear sanctions, and on the other hand, for 
making NK draw its own conclusion that reaching a resolution 
through dialog would be better than having sanctions placed on 
it," he made it clear that it was a "Security Council discussion 
for inducing dialog." 
  Going one step further, Minister Han, as if taking aim at 
the 
hard-line forces opposing his resolution through dialog, said, 
"The nature of the NK nuclear issue is not keeping someone from 
doing something, but making someone do something. In this sense, 
it can be compared to pulling a calf out of a vegetable garden." 
"Because if you try to drag the calf out by beating it, it's 
easy to end up ruining the garden, you have to pull it out by 
giving it a carrot and soothing it," he said. 
  It is a fact that this theory of Minister Han's, that 
fundamentally the NK nuclear issue must be solved by placating 
NK, has run up against the opposition of senior, policy decision 
makers in government ministries, such as Blue House, Unification 
Board, Ministry of National Defense [MND], Agency for National 
Security Planning [NSP], and most scholars of international 
politics. 
  At what point, then, does Minister Han actually differ from 
what policy decision makers? 
  The Blue House Secretary General Pak Kwan-yong, Secretary of 
foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk and 
Secretary of Unification Affairs Chong Se-hyon belong to the 
group called, "hard-line forces." Almost all officials below 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok of the Unification Board have 
argued for a strong response. Only Ku Pon-tae, Chief of the 
North-South Dialog Executive Office, has usually stressed a 
flexible response. He is classified as an exception within the 
Unification Board. 
  The MND has an "inborn" tendency to raise a strong voice. 
Both hard-line and moderate positions are reported to exist 
within the NSP. Particularly, in late March when Minister Han 
had the whole world against him, NSP moderates helped him as 
much as they could, reports one senior government official. 
  However, although positions are commonly classified as 
hard-line and moderate for convenience, those concerned are not 
too happy about being called hard-line or moderate. Minister Han 
says of himself, "I'm neither hard-line nor moderate, but a 
realist." Secretary Pak, Chief Chong and others within the Blue 
House strongly object to being labeled hard-liners. Who would 
not want to resolve the issue through dialog, they ask. It is 
only that there are some differences of opinion concerning ways 
of responding, depending on each situation, they say. 
  "If there is a difference in understanding between Minister 
Han and other diplomatic and security policy makers, it is that 
senior officials outside the MOFA are all displeased with 
Minister Han's "talking too much and showing too often and too 
many carrots as a card to play against NK," this source added. 
"Persons who are displeased with Minister Han and his tactical 
operation, and who are putting the brakes on it, also agree that 
the actual time to use the carrot toward NK must be after 
nuclear security has been secured," he said, "They only have 
mutual differing opinions on when to use the carrot with NK." 
  Putting together what this source said, there are no 
differences of opinion within the present administration's 
diplomacy and security team on strategy for resolving the NK 
nuclear issue; there are only some differences of perspective on 
the tactical operation of negotiations, dialog, and pressure. 
That is, the side which believes that in the event NK does not 
show sincerity in trying to resolve the nuclear issue and sticks 
to its attitude of refusing inspections, etc., strong pressure 
must be applied in order to bring a change of attitude are the 
so-called hard-liners; the officials of the Foreign Ministry 
symbolized by Minister Han believe that rather than pressure, 
the North must be given justification for participation in order 
to promote dialog. 
  However, Minister Han does not agree with the criticism 
about 
him that he talks too much and stresses dialog at a time when 
pressure must be applied. Han believes that we have nothing to 
loose by first providing NK with justification to enable it to 
respond to dialog. This means that if this effort at dialog to 
the last moment is successful, things could not be better; but 
even if it fails, then we can proceed to the next stage, 
extending our sympathy to the sanctions mood of the 
international community. 
  Some figures representative of those outside the 
administration classified as hard-liners are DLP lawmakers No 
Chae-pong and An Mu-hyok and many in the academic community. 
Their positions are generally follow the thinking below. 
  "We have now reached the stage to implement a coercive 
diplomacy against NK. For the success of coercive diplomacy, we 
must send them a message that our will to prevent NK from making 
a nuclear weapon is stronger than its motivation to do so, and 
must make it credible. Although we have demanded nuclear 
inspections of NK, we have hesitated to set a time restriction 
as a final communication to make NK comply with this. Even 
concerning NK noncompliance, we have committed the error of 
trying to entice NK with a carrot rather than punishing it." 
  Even if this difference of perspective is one of 
understanding concerning tactical operations for enticing NK to 
dialog, not a gap at the strategic level, its causes and effects 
are in reality very great. To put it another way, the debate 
over whether pressure or providing a justification for dialog 
would be more effective in breaking through the NK nuclear 
impasse, bringing dialog and negotiations, appears to be due to 
fundamental differences in the parties' views of NK. 
  Minister Han's view of NK is designated either the courteous 
"Older Brother Theory," which says to embrace NK, or the 
"Non-zero Sum Game Theory," which says that NK's gain is not 
necessarily our loss. His metaphors given in a press conference 
last February 28 accurately show his view of NK. 
  "The younger brother (NK) comes into the room holding a hand 
grenade (nuclear weapon), insisting he will not talk with his 
older brother (SK). However, he says he can talk with the old 
man next door (the U.S.), come out of the room and hand over the 
grenade, and threatens to explode the grenade if the older 
brother calls the police (UN or power of the international 
community). From the older brother's point of view, should he 
really call the police at this time? I mean, even though it is 
obvious that, although all the police would have to do is 
conduct one operation, the house would be wasted." 
  However, the Blue House and other hard-line forces' view of 
NK, that only coercive diplomacy can bring NK to dialog, is 
different. 
  "We in no way want a war. Because we would have to pay too 
high a price. However, at the time of the Panmunjom Axe Murder 
Incident in 1976, when ROK-U.S. Combined Forces made a strong 
display of military force and threatened to turn Kaesong into 
rubble, the North held up the white flag and Kim Il-song 
apologized. For the resolution of the NK nuclear issue as well, 
we must display our power through close military cooperation 
between SK and the U.S. If we continue to be dragged about by 
North Korean strategy as we are now, not only we will be wasting 
our time but give time NK need to complete a nuclear-weapons 
system capable of threatening us. Thus, in order to prevent a 
catastrophe on the Korean peninsula, we must have our resolute 
policy of strength and determination."

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- The Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP) announced on Thursday it had rounded up 
10 poeple suspected of having formed an underground organization 
of the North Korean Workers' (Communist) Party. 
  The agency said the ten persons, charged with violating the 
National Security Law, were led by An Chae-ku, age 61, a 
lecturer at Kyonghee University. 
  An was previouly arrested in October 1979 and was given a 
life term for his involvement in the case of "Namminjon" or the 
"South Korean Front for National Liberation." He was released 
in a special parole in December 1988. 
  His colleagues arrested included Chong Hwa-yo, 30, chief 
editor of Hanbaek Planning Co.; Hong Chung-hui, 37, head of the 
Wonju Labor Training Institute; Yu Nak-chin, 66, a calligrapher 
and former North Korean agent; and Pak Nae-kun, 42, head of the 
Ilsin Foreign Language Institute in Suwon. 
  The announcement said An set up the underground organization 
at the instructions of North Korea after he was won over in May 
1991 by a visiting North Korean operative active in Japan who 
was identified only as a "Paek" aged 58. 
  He received an operation fund of 10 million won from Paek 
and 
joined the Workers' Party. An then recruited co-workers and set 
up the "Kukuk Chonwi" or "Front for National Salvation" in 
January 1993, the agency said. 
  A number of evidential materials such as the organization's 
statute, a congratulatory message from North Korea, copies of 
reports to North Korea and a short-wave radio were collected 
through searches of his home at Kalhyon-tong and private office 
at Taehung- tong in Seoul last June 14, it said.

  [Text] In preparation for an all-out North Korean 
provocation against the South, the Defense Ministry authorities 
decided to complete the maintenance and supplementation of the 
combined ROK-U.S. munitions support system for the U.S. 
reinforcement forces by the end of July. 
  The Defense Ministry authorities intends to officially sign 
with the United States in September an overall munitions support 
agreement on the storage, support, and cost sharing for the 12 
areas of major strategic materials, including ammunition and 
communications, and to include it in writing in the Wartime Host 
Nation's Support Agreement [WHNS] signed between the ROK and the 
United States in 1991, after getting approval of the National 
Assembly. 
  The WHNS stipulates military and civilian support for the 
U.S. reinforcement forces to be deployed on the Korean peninsula 
in case of emergency, and the U.S. side is stockpiling 
up-to-date military equipment, including new-type ammunition, in 
advance. 
  A senior government military official on 16 June said, "We 
are checking and supplementing this plan in order to smoothly 
supply military supplies, such as ammunition and weapons, in 
case a war drags on." 
  The government official said that this comprehensive and 
systematic munitions support plan will also comprise the plan to 
enhance the capacity to mobilize the defense industry and the 
organic cooperation between the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and the 
2d ROK Army which is not under the control of the Combined 
Forces.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>
  [Text] Criticism is mounting over some citizen's rash and 
thoughtless action of hoarding provisions against a possible war 
amid mounting tension over the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Military experts said such reckless acts would only 
aggravate 
the situation eventually by dancing to the North Korean tune of 
psychological warfare. 
  They said such emergency buying is quite unnecessary because 
the North's military preparations for invasion would be 
detectable at least three months in advance. 
  Some people, mainly in wealthy apartment complexes in 
Kangnam, south of the Han River, began showing a keen sense of 
insecurity this week in sharp contrast to their earlier lack of 
concern about national security. 
  Such a drastic change of attitude was apparently nudged by 
the ever-intensifying North Korean stance over the nuclear 
issues highlighting withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Following the reports on the hawkish policy of the North, 
lots of people rushed to supermarkets and other stores to buy 
such contingency provisions as ramyon (fried instant noodles), 
rice, butane gas and medicines. 
  At the Grand Department Store in Taechi-tong, Kangnam-ku, 
all 
660 20-kg packs of rice in the store were sold out Tuesday, 
compared with an average daily sale of 160 packs. Residents in 
the region had to form long lines to buy such daily necessities 
as flour, canned food, canned gases and candlesticks etc. 
  A similar phenomenon took place in other department stores 
in 
Sanggye-tong in northern Seoul and Sinchon, north of the Han 
River. 
  Small stores are also enjoying profits from a remarkable 
increase in sales of such contingency necessities as candles, 
matches, batteries, wooden chopsticks and soap. 
  In an attempt to hang on to as much cash as possible, most 
buyers paid with credit cards. 
  Nhongshim Corp., one of the largest ramyon makers, said it 
began producing 30 percent more ramyon than average a day since 
this week. 
  The Bank of Korea also started to issue more cash than in 
ordinary time -- 49.3 billion won (61 million dollars) on June 
10, 42.8 billion won the next day and 57.4 billion won Monday. 
  The spread of a sense of instability is also seen in the 
increase in the number of people applying for visas for foreign 
tours. 
  A travel agency official said that the application increased 
by 30 percent this week, adding, "Most of their planned trips 
seemed not to have special purposes." 
  Military experts said there is no need for the people to buy 
a large amount of provisions because during wartime they would 
be moved to public places like schools for safety and daily 
necessities will be rationed. 
  They said the current buying spree among some people would 
be 
of no use if hostilities were to occur, but would only cause 
panic among the people.

  [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- More than half of Korean 
businesses with 100 or more workers had completed 
labor-management wage negotiations as of Wednesday, showing a 
higher rate of settlement than last year, the Labor Ministry 
said Thursday. 
  The ministry reviewed wage negotiations at the 5,483 
businesses with 100 or more employees across the nation and 
found that labor and management at 2,761 firms, about 50.4 
percent, had agreed on pay hikes for this year. 
  The rate compares with the 39.3 percent recorded for the 
same 
period last year. The negotiation settlement rate reached 50 
percent on June 28 last year. 
  The average wage increase at businesses which have settled 
negotiations was 6.5 percent, a bit higher than last year's 5.2 
percent. The rise was attributed mainly to the relatively 
higher commodity prices earlier this year and the overall 
business recovery, according to ministry officials. 
  Of the large business groups, Samsung showed the highest 
rate 
of settlement with 30 of its 35 subsidiaries, about 85.7 
percent, having reached agreement, followed by Lucky-Goldstar 
with 66.7 percent of its businesses wrapping up pay negotiations. 
  The ministry expected that wage negotiations will be 
concluded earlier this year than in 1993, although some 
automobile and shipbuilding firms have reported disputes to the 
ministry after failing to conclude a settlement.

    [Editorial Report] Seoul TONG-A ILBO on 23 May reported on 
page 2 that with the local election date set for 27 June 1995, 
the government is planning to transfer over 500 responsibilities 
to local governments. The government believes this will 
accelerate local autonomy. These tasks concern regional 
matters, including issues such as public welfare, revitalization 
of the economy, local transportation and roads, promotion of 
agriculture, and boosting local customs and culture. The 
government is sending two information-gathering teams to 15 
cities in May and a final decision will be announced in December.

  [Text] We are now witnessing a relationship between those 
in power and the media, so difficult to understand, that common 
sense would have one believe we have returned to the dark tunnel 
of past authoritarian times. One example is the suit for the 
incredible sum of 2 billion won against Hangyore 
Sinmun. It was published in an article on the disclosure 
made in a press interview by Chong Chae-chung---who alleged the 
president's son, Kim Hyon-chol, said that he was involved in the 
bribery scandal involving the lobbying money of an unlicensed 
oriental-medicines company. This was at the time of the 14th 
presidential election. 
  Citizens from all walks of life uniformly applaudeding the 
courage of Hangyore Sinmum by giving statements, 
calling, or visiting the newspaper company, and criticizing this 
irrational attack on the press is also reminiscent of the 
atmosphere of society during the past era of authoritarianism. 
The "stubborn silence" of others in the media---who had been 
raising their voices on various events, but had to take care 
concerning this incident---also resembled the media of the past, 
ever servile before the powerful. 
  Through an editorial about the lobbying-money scandal 
involving the government and the center of power, Hangyore 
Sinmun has already pointed out the excessive abuse of power 
and immorality shown by this response. To reiterate, the first 
thing the Blue House should do concerning this incident is to 
reveal the truth sincerely and in detail, apologize for what it 
should be sorry for, and punish those who deserve it. Yet, the 
response of those in power, at least in the eyes of the public, 
has been to make economic threats and force the one who made 
the revelation to withdraw it. This is done by bringing criminal 
charges against the one who divulged the scandal, by applying 
"pressure" to the media not to report the information made 
public through an interview, and, concerning Hangyore 
Sinmun's report of this, by filing a suit for an outrageous 
amount. 
  Given this situation, no matter what words the Blue House 
mobilizes to explain itself, it will not be able to convince the 
public. According to the public's understanding of this 
incident, when Chong Chae-chung, just an ordinary man, stood 
against the powerful, criticizing the president's son, who is 
reported to have great political influence, he would not have 
told groundless lies. 
  Holding an emergency joint meeting of the Seoul-Area Press 
Labor Union Chairmen's Group [Ollonsa Nojowiwonjangdan] last 
December, the National Alliance of Press Labor Unions [Chonguk 
Ollon Nodong Chohap Yonmaeng] [NAPLU] characterized the suit by 
Kim Hyon-chol as a "new media-control measure," and decided to 
oppose this head-on. This was a natural decision made out of 
deep concern for the arrogant posture of those in power and for 
a [possible] return to the government-media relationship of the 
past. The NAPLU announced that it would set out on a 
reporter-petition drive, demanding a Blue House explanation of 
the political-funding bribery incident and an end to the 
oppression of the media. The question of to what extent the 
labor union chairmen who made this decision and the reporters 
responding to the petition drive will be able to return each to 
their respective companies and realize the purpose of this 
resolution through the printed page will become the standard for 
measuring where we in the press now stand. The unified might of 
the media is truly a powerful weapon for beating back the 
oppression of the media by those in power and is the most 
certain ally of the true democratization and genuine reform of 
society.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Malaysia will 
make the necessary moves to overcome United States opposition to 
the establishment of the EAEC [East Asia Economic Caucus]. 
  A U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo reportedly presented to the 
Japanese Government on 7 June a report stating Washington's 
opposition to the establishment of EAEC because it could cause a 
negative impact on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. 
This is the first time that the Clinton administration has 
issued a clear signal that it opposes the setting up of the 
EAEC. Prior to this, the administration embarked on a 
wait-and-see attitude. 
  Speaking to newsmen after witnessing the signing of two 
agreements involving the transfer of waste water treatment 
technology to Thailand and Iran, the prime minister confirmed 
that this was Washington's official stand regarding EAEC. 
  Regarding Japan, which has yet to articulate its stand on 
the 
EAEC, Dr. Mahathir said the government will continue to make 
clarifications so that the country accepts the establishment of 
the caucus.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs will seek a clarification from the British Foreign 
Office over British Trade Minister Richard Needham's remarks 
that Britain may take retaliatory action against Malaysia over 
the freezing of new government contracts for British companies. 
  Acting Foreign Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said the 
cabinet will discuss the remarks only after obtaining the 
clarification from the British Government. 
  "At this point, the government has no plan to issue any 
statement and will wait until the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
seeks the British clarification, including on the authenticity 
of the source of this news report," he said during a news 
conference here today. 
  The REUTERS report carried by several newspapers here today 
quoted Needham as saying that British Prime Minister John Major 
will be under pressure to retaliate if Malaysia continues the 
sanctions. 
  "The longer they leave it, the more likelihood there is of 
retaliation by the British side. The longer it goes on, the 
more voices will be raised against it," REUTERS quoted Needham 
as saying. 
  Malaysia froze the awarding of new government contracts to 
British companies after the British media slandered government 
leaders, including Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. 
  The British leaders have ever since been divided over the 
matter, although not a few of them have blamed their media for 
it. 
  Needham left for home yesterday after concluding his second 
visit in two weeks to the country. Needham, who led a 
delegation of private British investors and companies, met 
several national leaders during the visit. 
  Commenting on Needham's statement that the sanction may be 
lifted within six weeks, Abu Hassan said the government has not 
issued any decision. 
  "We do not reject private British companies, especially 
those 
involved in technology transfer. However, they must respect the 
government's stance," he said. 
  Commenting on Britain's readiness to help Malaysia counter 
pressure on the generalized system of preferences [GSP] by 
increasing trade with the European Union, Abu Hassan said the 
government welcomed any proposals that could increase the 
country's trade. 
  "However, this should not be used as a reason for Malaysia 
to 
lift sanctions against Britain. The two issues are entirely 
different," he said.

  [Text] Bachok, Tues. -- Fisheries enforcement officials 
detained two Thai fishing boats and seized weapons, including a 
revolver, a pump gun, and 153 rounds of ammunition about 26 
nautical miles from Pantai Bachok at 7.40am today. 
  Fisheries Director General Datuk Shahrom Abdul Majid said 
the 
weapons were found on board one of the boats. 
  "We also found two dogs on the boat " he added. 
  He said 19 Thai fishermen, between 17 and 4 years, from the 
boats were being detained at the Bachok Police Station for 
questioning. 
  He said it was the first case where firearms were found on 
foreign fishing boats caught for encroaching on Malaysian 
territorial waters. 
  He said the fishermen would be charged with fishing 
illegally 
in the exclusive economic zone and for possession of firearms.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 16 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The paper on 
proposals to attract foreign and Malaysian scientists and 
engineers working abroad to the country is ready and awaiting 
approval from the relevant government agencies, Science, 
Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said Thursday. 
  He said the working committee, headed by his deputy, Peter 
Chin, had finalised the paper recently and was waiting for 
government agencies such as the Public Services Department and 
Treasury to endorse it before presenting it to the cabinet for 
final approval. 
  The scheme was meant to meet the country's needs for 
scientists and engineers to fulfil its plan to be an 
industrialised nation by the year 2020, he told reporters after 
opening an exhibition on the beauty of nature at the National 
Museum here. 
  Law said that the incentive package, among others, offered 
the target group salaries comparable to that offered by other 
countries with fringe benefits including permanent resident 
status, if necessary.

  [Text] Malaysia Airlines [MAS] has entered into a 
tripartite alliance with Malaysian Helicopter Services and World 
Airways Incorporated to expand its fast-growing international 
cargo services business. Several agreements signed today 
between the parties would enable MAS to purchase cargo (?safes) 
and expand its business in the main markets of Europe, the 
United States, and the high-growth Asia-Pacific region beginning 
the 19th of this month. 
  MAS deputy managing director for marketing, Baharuddin 
Nordin, said the carrier would be able to tap the intra-European 
freight market centering around Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Zurich, 
Paris, and Brussels. It will also provide a direct link between 
Penang and Los Angeles and cater for electronic exports which 
are ballooning. This is evident by the 33 billion ringgit 
[Malaysian currency] in Malaysia's exports of the products in 
the January-September 1993 period. 
  Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines success in organizing annual 
haj 
pilgrimages to Mecca for thousands of Muslims has caught the eye 
of World Airways Incorporated. The Washington-based airline is 
now keen to organize pilgrimages for the growing Muslim 
population in America and China. World Airways executive vice 
president Encik [Mr.] Ahmad K. Khatib said in Kuala Lumpur that 
Malaysia had done exceptionally well in this area and the airway 
wants to emulate it, for it is not easy to organize flights for 
thousands of pilgrims. He said this to newsmen after a 
tripartite signing agreement beetween MAS, Malaysian Helicopter 
Services [MHS] and World Airways which will enable MAS to expand 
its international cargo business. MHS has a 24.9 percent stake 
in World Airways. 
  MHS executive director Wan Malik Ibrahim said World Airways 
could utilize the linkages Malaysia has developed with China to 
tap into the country's Muslim population which is said to be 
larger than the Muslim population in Malaysia.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 16 KYODO -- A Myanmar 
[Burma] military government leader made no reference to the fate 
of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under 
house arrest, during his meeting with a Japanese business 
mission Thursday [16 June], mission members said. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, secretary of the ruling State Law and 
Order Restoration Council, defended the house arrest of the 
Nobel Peace Prize winner and brushed aside the concept of human 
rights. "What are human rights as referred to by western people 
are targeted to limited people," Nyunt was quoted as telling the 
business delegation organized by the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren). July 5 will mark the fifth 
anniversary of Suu Kyi's house arrest. Diplomatic sources in 
Yangon said the military government plans to continue the arrest 
beyond that date. 
  Nyunt told the Keidanren mission that his government will 
make efforts to promote economic development and achieve 
political stability before moving toward a nation under civilian 
rule, mission members said. 
  Kazuo Haruna, chairman of Marubeni Corp. and head of the 
45-member team, told Nyunt it is regrettable that Japan's 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) has been suspended since 
1988 and expressed hope that it will be resumed as soon as 
possible, they said. 
  The mission, the largest Japanese delegation ever to visit 
the country, is holding talks with Myanmar leaders on projects 
including Myanmar's oil industry. The delegation is due to 
depart the country Saturday.

  [Text] A visiting Japanese economic mission led by Mr. 
(Kazuo Haruna), vice chairman of the Keidanren entrepreneurs 
organization and chairman of the Marubeni Corporation, 
accompanied by Japanese Ambassador Mr. Takashi Tajima paid a 
courtesy call on Vice Admiral Maung Maung Khin, chairman of 
Myanmar [Burma] Investment Commission and deputy prime minister, 
at the latter's office at 1100 this morning. 
  Later, the Japanese economic mission led by Mr. (Kazuo 
Haruna) held talks with the Myanmar delegation led by Vice Adm. 
Maung Maung Khin at the meeting hall of the Myanmar Investment 
Commission Office. Also present at the meeting were Brigadier 
General Abel, minister of national planning and economic 
development, and responsible departmental personnel. 
  First, Vice Adm. Maung Maung Khin welcomed the guests. Next, 
the Japanese economic mission leader expressed his appreciation 
for the opportunity to express his views. He explained that 
bilateral cooperation would benefit both sides and noted his 
entourage includes leading entrepreneurs. He went on to say 
investment, technical know how, and exports should be increased 
for private sector economic development. They will create more 
jobs which in turn will bolster economic development. He noted 
many investment opportunities for Japan exist in Myanmar. 
  Vice Adm. Maung Maung Khin expressed his happiness at 
meeting 
the Japanese entrepreneurs. He explained that local and foreign 
entrepreneurs are legally allowed to invest and engage in 
business activities in Myanmar. He noted that Myanmar is mainly 
utilizing its domestic resources for economic development. It 
also utilizes foreign assistance, and privatization of some 
state economic enterprises is being done in accordance with 
existing laws. 
  Following this, the Japanese mission inquired about the 
Myanmar Foreign Investment Law, privileges and incentives, and 
investment opportunities. Vice Adm. Maung Maung Khin, Brig. 
Gen. Abel, and responsible personnel answered the queries. The 
bilateral talks ended at 1200 noon. 
  At 1400, Brig. Gen. Abel explained Myanmar's prevailing 
situation, economic development, and investment opportunities to 
the Japanese economic mission at the hall of the International 
Business Center. Minister Abel next presented detailed 
explanations to queries raised by the Japanese mission. 
  Next, U Ohn Gyaw, minister of foreign affairs, extensively 
explained the activities relating to Myanmar's drug abuse 
control programs and environmental protection matters. The 
ceremony came to a close after Foreign Affairs Minister U Ohn 
Gyaw gave necessary explanations to queries raised by the 
delegation.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 17 KYODO -- Myanmar's 
[Burma] military junta is preparing "democratic foundations" for 
a civilian government, sources close to a Japanese business 
delegation quoted the chairman of the junta as saying Friday [17 
June]. 
  The sources said senior Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the 
ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), told a 
delegation from the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren) on Friday that, "though the military had to step in 
for a national emergency, the military should not stay in power 
for a long time." 
  "It is only natural that power be transferred to the 
civilian 
government. The SLORC is preparing democratic foundations 
before power transfer so that no more military intervention 
would be necessary in the future," Than Shwe was quoted by the 
sources as saying. 
  The 46-member delegation led by Kazuo Haruna, chairman of 
Marubeni Corp., arrived in Yangon on Wednesday for a four-day 
mission to explore investment possibilities in Myanmar. 
  SLORC Secretary Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, National Planning and 
Economic Development Minister Brig. Gen. David Abel and Foreign 
Minister Ohn Gyaw separately briefed the delegation Thursday on 
Myanmar's political, economic and foreign relations situations. 
  The delegation will be briefed by other ministers on various 
sectors of economy in the country later in the day, and it will 
visit industrial sites and a new port site near Yangon on 
Saturday before returning to Tokyo the same evening. 
  Myanmar's military seized power in a coup in September 1988 
and established the SLORC. 
  In May 1990 national elections the National League for 
Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide 
victory, but the military junta has refused to hand over power. 
  Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been under house 
arrest in Yangon since July 1989.

  [Text] Malaysia's Rapid Deployment Force, RDF, will be 
equipped with new weaponry such as tanks, armored personnel 
carriers, and light anti-aircraft missiles. Defense Minister 
Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said today the procurement of the 
equipment for the force, which was to be formalized, in 
September will be made in stages depending on the government's 
financial capability. 
  He said, initially the force would be supported by the 
current armored personnel carriers, APC, in the Royal Armored 
Corps, the Short Starburst manned portable anti-aircraft 
missile, the Hercules transport of the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF], and vessels from the Royal Malaysian Navy. 
  He said the purchase of more new equipment for the RDF 
requirement will be made in stages to provide the force with 
better mobility and fire power. He was speaking to newsmen 
after launching the ministry's Ma'al Hegira [Muslim New Year] 
celebration in Kuala Lumpur.

first time arming its ships with an air defense role. The RSN's 
six missile gunboats, MGB's, and support ships will be fitted 
with surface-to-air missiles. Acquired from France, the 
missiles will replace the Bofors anti-aircraft guns on the MGB's 
by next year. Second Defense Minister Dr. Lee Boon Yang 
described the upgrading exercise as practical. He said the 
introduction of improved technology like the Mistral missiles 
allows for the best use of RSN investment over the years. Dr. 
Lee was speaking at Brani Naval Base this morning when he 
visited the 185 Squadron.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Democratic Kampuchea Delegation on the </F>
Cease-fire;" dated 15 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. The entire Cambodian nation and people, 
including the people in Phnom Penh and in rural areas and 
abroad, are very tired of the longer than two-decade war. The 
Cambodian nation and people do not want war. They yearn for 
peace and want all Cambodian parties to reconcile, in genuine 
national unity and peace so that every Cambodian has a chance to 
live normally. 
  His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk thought about the 
roundtable meeting and the meeting of the roundtable commission 
to reconcile the nation and for peace. This represents his 
lofty desire to see all sides hold successive meetings, and to 
show increased mutual understanding until full national 
reconciliation and national concord are achieved. 
  The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] as a nationalist 
force has fought with the entire Cambodian nation and people for 
the survival of the Cambodian nation, people, and race for over 
15 years. It does not want to seek or seize power and is not 
greedy. As the victim, the PDK, like the Cambodian nation and 
people, want to quickly end the war and reconcile the nation. 
It wants to rally all national forces so that the Cambodian 
motherland has peace and national union again with independence 
and territorial integrity. 
  II. Now, in the past and future, the PDK has been happy to 
have a cease-fire. The PDK does not want war and fighting. We 
only want the war to end quickly and to achieve national 
reconciliation and peace quickly. The PDK holds that the 
cease-fire should be within the framework of a solution to 
achieve genuine national reconciliation and peace. Therefore, 
it is necessary to have a permanent cease-fire that is effective 
nationwide, with proper and adequate control by a commission or 
technical group to be set up to deal with this issue. We 
believe it is imperative to avoid using the cease-fire as a 
trick to cheat one another and the local and foreign public in 
order to continue fighting. In this case, it would not be a 
genuine cease-fire and fighting would continue. This would be 
against the will and aspiration of our nation and people who 
want to restore genuine national reconciliation and peace. 
  The Cambodian situation is very complex with the issues of 
war and national and social problems. Problems related to the 
war in Cambodia for over two decades have not been created by 
Cambodians and are not problems among Cambodians. These 
problems have been created by direct foreign interference and 
aggression. Fueling the war does not respond to the interest of 
the Cambodian nation and people. People are aware of the great 
suffering and destruction of the country during the over 
20-year-long war. Continuing the war only serves the interest 
of foreigners whose aim and strategy are to annex Cambodia and 
place it in their orbit. This is particularly true for the 
communist Vietnamese who want the war in Cambodia to continue. 
They have pushed Cambodians into fighting and killing 
nationalist Cambodians so that communist Vietnam has a chance to 
bring in Vietnamese nationals to annex Cambodia. 
  With this aim and strategy in mind, foreigners do not want 
national reconciliation, national union, and peace in Cambodia. 
They only want to fuel the war so that they have a pretext and a 
chance to interfere in Cambodia in every way. Therefore, the 
cease-fire is not in the hands of Cambodians. The fact is that 
the cease-fire is an old issue the communist Vietnamese had 
raised a long time ago. It is one of three conditions raised by 
the communist Vietnamese to eliminate the PDK and the Cambodian 
people's resistance forces. People are aware of this. 
  It should be recalled that the three conditions were: 
  1. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to implement a cease-fire; 
  2. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to hand over all its zones 
to the former State of Cambodia of the communist Vietnamese, and 
now to the two-headed government; and 
  3. Getting Democratic Kampuchea to demobilize all its 
troops. 
  III. Despite all this, the PDK holds that as long as 
Cambodians strive to meet, talk, compromise, and make mutual 
concessions, we will eventually and gradually solve all these 
problems and move toward national reconciliation. Talking about 
the cease-fire and national reconciliation without concrete 
evidence is like the present situation following the election of 
UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. People are aware 
of how bitter this has been. 
  This is the issue we have to discuss, now and in the future, 
until full national reconciliation and peace are achieved. The 
entire Cambodian nation and people are waiting to see a genuine 
cease-fire that is vital to them. 
  [Dated] 15 June 1994

  [Text] Teams of 40 to 50 soldiers have been stationed on 
the nation's trains to protect passengers from continued Khmer 
Rouge attacks, the commander of the Royal Army's train 
protection force said. 
  Service on the Phnom Penh-Battambang and Phnom 
Penh-Sihanoukville train lines was halted for most of May 
because of attacks and damage to the tracks but resumed on May 
21, said the commander, Sok Nearadei. 
  The Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Ministry 
of Defense authorised the resumption of service in late May, he 
said. The number of soldiers on board was doubled after service 
resumed. 
  "But I don't know whether they can maintain security for the 
passengers or not," he said. 
  Sok Nearadei has also contacted the provincial commanders on 
the trains' routes to make sure there have been no recent 
incidents that might jeopardize the safety of the passengers. 
  Since January 1993 there have been 72 attacks on the 
nation's 
two trains and their tracks, Sok Nearadei said. 
  In those attacks 76 people were killed, and 207 wounded. In 
addition, 10 train engines, 26 wagons, 11 bridges and 1,008 
meters of railway line were destroyed. 
  Though he said he hopes the teams of soldiers hired to 
protect the train will help to improve security, "Soldiers are 
helpless when it comes to the mines laid on tracks by guerrilla 
forces." 
  While local authorities in Kampot and Kompong Som Province 
have said that security seems to have improved, the train to 
Battambang is still plagued by Khmer Rouge activities. 
  On June 6 the Battambang train was delayed after the Kouk 
Trom bridge in northwestern Cambodia was destroyed. Service on 
the line currently ends in Pursat, but another train is running 
from Banteay Meanchey to Battambang.

  [Text] Denpasar, Bali, June 16 (OANA-ANTARA) -- 
Negotiations between Indonesia and the U.S. on quotas for 
textiles and textile products held here last week have suffered 
only a temporary setback, an industry and trade official has 
said. 
  "With the adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), the quota system, which is against the spirit of 
GATT, will certainly be scrapped," Assistant to the coordinating 
minister for industry and trade Kosim Gandataruna said in Nusa 
Dua (Bali) Wednesday. 
  After closing the 10th convention of the International 
Apparel Federation (IAF) here, he said: "If the negotiations 
have become stalled because of certain problems, this will not 
last for longer than a decade." 
  He said that in the short-term Indonesia's exports of 
textile 
and textile products to the U.S. will continue despite the 
failure of negotiations. 
  In reply to a question asking why the U.S. stubbornly 
maintained its uncompromising stance during the negotiations, he 
said that the U.S. side continues to link trade with, among 
other things, human rights practices in Indonesia.

  [Text] Bandung, KOMPAS -- Indonesia needs to embark on 
numerous domestic economic restructuring in an effort to compete 
with the other Asia-Pacific countries. The restructuring should 
be carried out not only through the issuance of deregulation 
packages but through the compatibility of the economic structure 
aimed at upgrading its competitiveness and providing a resilient 
national economy. 
  Speaking at the symposium on Reforms in the Asia-Pacific and 
Indonesia's Study on the Asia-Pacific at the Merdeka building in 
Bandung on 4 June, Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammed said, "We 
should absorb what is good." The other speakers were the head 
of the International Relations from CSIS, Drs. Bantarto Bandoro 
MA [Master of Arts], Drs. Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata MA and an 
economic observer, Dr. Shahrir. 
  According to Mari'e, all matters pertaining to the national 
economy should be carried out with a view to fortifying 
Indonesia's competitiveness at the international level. This 
needs to be carried out because countries which are competitive 
are becoming stronger than Indonesia, such as the PRC, Vietnam 
and India -- all of them recently embarked on extensive 
economic restructuring. 
  Mari'e said Indonesia should take full advantage of the 
opportunities which the Asia-Pacific region has to offer, 
particularly in trade activities, investments and exports. The 
glamorous economic era of the Atlantic countries has begun to 
decline and more countries are turning toward the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  Mari'e clarified that with the agreement reached at the 
Uruguay Round at the end of 1993, major changes and trends had 
occurred in the volume of international trade. This will bring 
about far-reaching implications and complications in connection 
with investments and international relations. 
  The Asia-Pacific region is a dynamic region and its 
development is rapidly expanding. It has become the locomotive 
for global economic development. Mari'e added that currently 
the population of the Asia-Pacific region amounts to 40 percent 
of the total world population. The region's Gross Domestic 
Product, GDP, has reached 50 percent. 
  According to Mari'e, the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific 
regional countries was recorded at an annual average of seven 
percent over the five consecutive years. This is a performance 
which had never been achieved by any region, including Europe. 
  Touching on APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], the 
finance minister said the grouping discussed the substance in 
greater depth. APEC would direct itself toward transforming the 
Asia-Pacific region into a region free from obstacles, paving 
the way for international trade and investment capital flows. 
  Mari'e said the 17-member APEC forum was established in 1989 
by the former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke. He said, 
"Even though the United States is currently experiencing an 
economic setback, APEC's development depends on the American 
interest." 
  Meanwhile, Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata called for lesser 
dependency 
on on any cooperation forum which only makes rhetoric calls, and 
Indonesia should learn a lesson from the U.S.-Japan conflict and 
the collapse of the G-15 summit in New Delhi. 
  Bob Sugeng also clarified that, in facing the problem of 
conflicting interests within APEC members, Indonesia is becoming 
more dependent on the global market. As such, it would be better 
for Indonesia to externalize its national economy by eliminating 
any sentimental or emotional rhetoric. 
  Indonesia should avoid being too involved in any cooperation 
group which practises emotional solidarity. It should take a 
pragmatic approach by increasing its bargaining power at 
international forums. Probably, Indonesia should embark upon 
such a pragmatic approach in cooperation forums such as the APEC. 
  Another economic observer, Shahrir, considered that by the 
year 2005, there would be a new world with free trade in which 
the Asia-Pacific region would be the nucleus for global trade. 
This depends on the APEC members capability of providing 
employment for their populace while maintaining a high economic 
growth rate.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Deregulation Package for Investments] </F>
  [Text] A new deregulation package was issued by the 
government which permits foreign investors to monopolize public 
interests. Due to the inability of domestic investors to operate 
the foreign investments, some 95 percent of the shares were 
permitted to be owned by foreign investors. As such, foreign 
investors are permitted to purchase a large portion of shares of 
the infrastructure in the public interest in sectors such as 
ports, the production and supply of electricity to the public, 
railway services, nuclear-powered electricity generating plants 
and the mass media. 
  The deregulation package which was issued is named 
Government 
Regulation No:20/1994. It was endorsed by President Suharto on 
19 May 1994. It was laid down in the regulation that foreign 
investments can be made through two methods -- through direct 
investments and through joint ventures. Foreign investors are 
permitted to own a 95-percent stake if investments are carried 
out through joint ventures. As for direct investments, foreign 
investors are permitted to own a 100-percent stake and their 
investments should be exclusively situated within industrialized 
zones. 
  In short, we fully understand the statement made by Sanyoto 
Sastrowardoyo, Minister of State for Investment and Chairman of 
the Investment Coordinating Board, who said: "This is a 
courageous and big breakthrough [preceding two words in 
English]." According to Sanyoto, the foreign investors had been 
waiting for such a deregulation package to commence their 
operations in Indonesia. The government regulation was in 
accordance with Regulation No: 1/1967. But what went wrong? A 
group of industrialists, parliamentarians and people doubted 
that the new deregulation package would be successful. 
  For example, Benny Sutrisno observed that the government 
could be fully liberal because it could totally absorb the 
market economy by making attractive investment offers to foreign 
investors, including the public sector. Benny Sutrisno said he 
would agree only if such an action was undertaken for the sake 
of strengthening the country's economy. Apart from this, 
questions were also raised on whether approximations were taken 
into consideration on the negative aspect of the deregulation 
package. But it was different with Kwik Kian Gie, a 
philanthrophist and economist. He was surprised at the 
government's decision to make an almost full offer of the public 
sectoral activities to foreign investors. He was confused over 
the definition of "the people's aspiration for a livelihood." 
  In fact, segments of the community are still in the dark 
over 
the government's strategy of offering the industrial sector to 
foreign investors. Therefore, it was probable that numerous 
persons have a similar opinion to that of Benny Sutrisno. The 
opinion was that it was clear that the government was 
independent in making the decision, which could prove to be 
critical. Those from the elite [preceding word in English] 
economic strata would definitely fall victim to this 
deregulation package. The public will definitely have to 
support the losses. This is considered to be an unfair practise. 
  Besides, there are those who considered that the 
deregulation 
package could spark off public anxiety because certain groups 
have varying convictions regarding the provisions of the 1945 
Constitution -- particularly the conflict which prevails between 
the ministers who favored the Government Regulation No: 20/1994 
and certain parliamentarians who were ill-informed of the 
deregulation package. In fact, the government should have held 
consultations with the members of the House of Representatives 
prior to the announcement of the new deregulation package, which 
could provoke a multitude of queries. 
  We had pledged to further strengthen our climate of openness 
and democracy. On 11 March 1966, we conscientiously pledged to 
implement and uphold Pancasila [State ideology] and the 1945 
Constitution. Then, why issue the new deregulation package, 
which is not in compliance with the provision of Chapter 14 of 
Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution which states: All branches 
of production which are of significant national importance and 
which are in the public interest are state property. If we are 
still unconvinced by this, then let us again look again at the 
contents of Guide Book 1 on Pancasila. Let us look again at 
Chapter II [Roman two] on the Basic National Development, the 
Development Objectives under item A and the Bases for National 
Development under item B. Regarding the first four out of seven 
bases laid down for our national development, there is clearly a 
stress laid on the bases being for benefit, joint ventures, 
democracy and equal justice. These are wanting in the new 
deregulation package.

  [Text] Bandung, REPUBLIKA -- The circulation of illegal 
anti-Chinese pamphlets has irritated college students in 
Bandung. They have expressed concern over allegations that 
their campus is masterminding the circulation. "The growing 
activities of Bandung college students have never degenerated 
and will never degenerate into racism and anarchy," a joint 
statement of the Bandung College Students Council said. 
  The Bandung college students have in fact been hit by the 
allegations because the circulation of the illegal pamphlets 
coincided with student demonstrations in the city over the 
Bapindo case [Indonesian Development Bank credit scandal] which 
was one of the focuses of the illegal pamphlets. 
  In the official statement, which was received by REPUBLIKA 
on 
Wednesday (8 June), they expressed concern over the circulation 
of the illegal pamphlets. The statement was signed by the 
general chairman of the Bandung Pedagogy College Students 
Council, head of the External Affairs Division of the Pasundan 
University Students Council, and president of the Bandung 
Islamic University Students Council. Students of the Pasundan 
University and the Bandung Islamic University have been the most 
frequent demonstrators over the Bapindo case. 
  They said: "We are concerned over the situation and are 
trying to study the current phenomenon while playing a role in 
restoring racial harmony." 
  For them, the Eddy Tansil mammoth corruption case, in which 
many senior state officials are implicated, has created a 
prolonged conflict. In addition, the case has also triggered 
racist moves and opinion. "Accordingly, we ask all interested 
parties to immediately and fairly settle the extremely 
destructive national case," concluded the statement. 
  Bandung has apparently become the source of illegal 
pamphlets 
and anti-Chinese rumors in recent weeks. Rumors that ethnic 
Chinese-owned shops have been and will be destroyed have 
surfaced several times. 
  Last Thursday, the chief of the West Java Provincial Police 
said he knew about the pamphlets and was studying the case. In 
the same week, copies of a letter warning the general public 
against being provoked by misleading issues emerged. The letter 
was handwritten and bore the unsealed name the Military District 
Command 0618/BS. 
  The Bandung college students have in fact been determined to 
continue demonstrations over the Bapindo case until Sudomo 
[chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council chairman], Sumarlin 
[chairman of the State Auditing Board], and Nasruddin 
Sumintapura [member of the Supreme Advisory Council] are tried. 
The determination angered Major General Muzani Syukur, 
commander of the Siliwangi Third Military Region Command, who 
later issued a ban on street demonstrations. 
  Anti-Chinese illegal pamphlets subsequently spread during 
the 
murky situation in which citizens were urged to take to the 
streets on Sunday (5 June). Armed Forces Commander General 
Feisal Tanjung said in Jakarta on Tuesday (7 June) that the 
pamphlets were made by persons who just wanted to kill time. 
  In the meantime, the Bandung college students of 1966 and 
1978 said in a separate statement that they reaffirmed support 
for the college student activism. In the statement to REPUBLIKA 
on Tuesday (7 June), they said that the college students have 
been cornered and considered a dangerous element in society. 
  The former college students who called themselves "old 
demonstrators" hoped that the college students would remain 
constant in the current struggle. "Either morally or 
physically," concluded Thomas Sitepu and friends.

  [Text] Melbourne, June 16 (OANA/ANTARA/REUTERS) - 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is in good condition 
after heart bypass surgery in Australia and could leave hospital 
next week, an Indonesian Consulate official said on Thursday. 
  "He's fine. Good condition. Stable. Next Monday or 
Tuesday, he could leave the hospital," Indonesia's Melbourne 
Vice Consul Bambang Tarsanto told REUTERS. 
  Alatas, 61, was admitted to the private Epworth Hospital in 
Melbourne on Sunday and underwent a three-hour quadruple bypass 
operation on Monday after suffering a heart attack last month. 
  Bambang said the foreign minister's departure from hospital 
and return to Indonesia would depend on advice from his surgeon, 
Professor Brian Buxton, the hospital's head of cardiac surgery. 
  But he said he had no idea when Alatas would return to work. 
  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating visited Alatas on 
Wednesday. 
  Alatas is a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement and in 
preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation.

  [Excerpt] Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] Prime 
Minister Khamtai Siphandon and Prime Minister Kang Song-san of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) expressed 
satisfaction over the growing relations of friendship and 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  This was said at a banquet hosted on the evening of June 3 
at 
the National Assembly Hall by the Lao Prime Minister in honour 
of his visiting DPRK counterpart. 
  Among those attending the banquet on the Lao side were 
Deputy 
Prime Minister and President of the Committee for Planning and 
Cooperation Khamphoui Keoboualapha, Foreign Minister Somsavat 
Lengsavat, National Assembly standing members, ministers and 
members of the Lao Committee in Support of the Peaceful 
Reunification of Korea. 
  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon said in his speech, "while 
visiting your beautiful country in December last year, I was 
very pleased to have seen its continued growth. Within 46 years 
alone, the Korean people boosted their spirit of self-reliance, 
building their own strength based on the Juche [self-reliance] 
idea and overcoming various difficulties and obstacles, hence 
enabling the DPRK, once a poor and backward country, to become 
the socialist one with increasingly advanced agriculture, 
industry and technical science." He added that these 
achievements were evidence of the capable and wise leadership of 
the Workers' Party of Korea with the Korean people's Great 
Leader Kim Il-song as the head. 
  He also said that the current visit by the DPRK government 
delegation came at a time when the Lao people were focusing 
their efforts on implementing the comprehensive renovation 
policy of the party as well as the state socioeconomic 
development plan for the period towards the year 2000, designed 
to further build and develop the people's democratic regime and 
raise the living standard of the people, making the country 
stronger and wealthier. He stressed that the task was certain to 
be successful thanks to the unity of the Lao people, who are 
one-minded and resolute in advancing along their chosen path, 
and to valuable experience gained from more than ten years of 
national defence and development combined with support from 
close and distant friendly countries. 
  He said, "this afternoon, we both expressed our will to 
further work towards closer and more fruitful friendly relations 
and cooperation between the Lao PDR and the DPRK." The Lao Prime 
Minister also confirmed Laos' consistent support for the Korean 
people's just cause of safeguarding and building their socialist 
fatherland on the northern part and of reunifying their country 
by peaceful means as well as making the Korean peninsula a 
peaceful, stable and nuclear-free zone. 
  On his part, Prime Minister Kang Song-san expressed deep 
thanks to the Lao government for extending warm hospitality to 
him and his delegation during their visit. He said, "we visited 
your country to further strengthen the relationship and 
cooperation between our two countries." He added that in recent 
years, delegations in more fields from the two countries have 
met and visited each other, he said. 
  The DPRK Prime Minister added, "we are very pleased to have 
visited the Lao PDR, a fraternal country, and to have seen with 
our own eyes actual achievements your people have scored in the 
task of building the new regime. Now the Lao people have greatly 
achieved the implementation of the socioeconomic development 
till the year 2000 for the prosperity of the country under the 
correct leadership of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party." 
  Speaking of the national development in his country, he said 
the Korean people are now realizing a policy of turning 
agriculture, industry and trade into priority areas, and are 
striving to achieve peaceful reunification of their country 
through setting up a federation based on the principle of 
national independence under the clear sighted leadership of both 
Great Leader Kim Il-song and Dear Leader Kim Jong-il. 
  He also said that from now on they would do their best to 
step up solidarity and friendship with the people of Asia as 
well as with the people of Laos. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit, Deputy 
Director of the Lao People's Army General Staff Department on 
June 3 denied allegations by Thailand that the Lao People's Army 
used chemical weapons along the Lao-Thai border, saying that the 
allegations were unfounded. 
  The army brigadier, who is also chairman of the 
sub-Committee 
for Lao-Thai Border Security Keeping, said in a press 
conference, "Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, member of the 
sub-Committee for Thai-Lao Border Security Keeping, made a 
statement through Thai Radio and Thai TV (Channel 3) on the 
evenings of May 26, 27 and 28 alleging that the Lao People's 
Army put chemical substances into water and on tree leaves in 
the area along Thai-Lao border opposite Thai Phayao's Chiang 
Khan District, Thai Nan's Mae Rin District and Ban Sok in Thai 
Uttaradit and that this caused death to Lao people and animals." 
  He said the same statement was also published in the May 27 
issue of "Thailand Times" and in the May 26 issue of "Daily 
News". 
  Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit categorically denied 
the 
Thai army officer's allegation and confirmed that the Lao 
People's Army neither spread chemical substances over those 
areas nor possessed any such chemical weapons, chemical 
substances, nor have they purchased any such chemical substances 
from abroad. He added that such a news report was simply a 
fabrication by Thai authorities. He stressed that not only was 
it slander against the Lao People's Army and the Lao PDR [Lao 
People's Democratic Republic] but also an act of sabotage 
against the Lao-Thai relations, causing trouble in the areas 
concerned and creating misunderstanding between the people of 
Laos and Thailand. 
  The Lao army officer also held that the one who created the 
event had to solve it. This means that Colonel Prasit 
Mongkhontham must admit his statement in front of the Lao side 
during the meeting of the committees for Lao-Thai border 
security keeping scheduled to take place in Vientiane late June 
this year. 
  He elaborated that to improve cooperation in common border 
security keeping both sides had to strictly implement the 
relevant agreement signed between the two committees for border 
security. Only in so doing would the two armies be able to 
fulfill their responsibilities to their respective governments 
for safeguarding peace and security along the common border.

General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council of the Union of Myanmar [Burma], is a great 
honor for our country, as it was the first country he visited on 
his overseas trip. During his four days here, in addition to 
holding official talks with H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
H.E. Gen. Than Shwe also called on H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, 
chairman of the party Central Committee. During the talks, the 
two leaders exchanged views on the situation in their respective 
country, thus enabling each other to understand more deeply the 
changes that are taking place. The most important event of the 
visit was the signing of three agreements by the two sides as 
reported earlier, namely the agreement on the international 
boundary; the agreement on the establisment of a joint 
commission for economic, scientific, and technical cooperation; 
and the agreement on tourism cooperation. I believe that the 
three agreements are politically and economically significant 
because they have laid down a basis for the strengthening of 
relations between our two countries in the future. 
  Therefore, it can be said that the visit was very successful 
and the two sides are very satisfied with its outcome. Before 
we came here, H.E. Chairman Than Shwe and H.E. President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan also met and had a chat with each other, reaffirming 
the success of this visit.

the delegation from the Propaganda and Training Board of the Lao 
People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee led by Osakan 
Thammatheva, member of the Party Central Committee and acting 
chief of the Propaganda and Training Board, returned to 
Vientiane on 16 June. The visit, which began on 9 June, was 
gloriously successful. During the visit, the Lao delegation 
discussed and exchanged experiences with a delegation from the

implementation of ideological work. The visit has contributed 
to enhancing the traditional solidarity between the two parties, 
two states, and two peoples of Laos and China. 
  In addition to visiting Beijing and calling on Chinese 
leaders, the Lao delegation visited Tianjin and Kunming. The 
delegation was accorded a warm welcome by Chinese hosts 
everywhere they went. The delegation has also invited a 
delegation from the CPC Central Committee Propaganda and 
Training Board to visit Laos.

  [Text] Australia, Asia's third largest economy, has 
reiterated its misgivings over the formal launching of the East 
Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), saying that its exclusion of the 
United States will only create "dangerous fissures" within 
Asia-Pacific. 
  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who left Manila 
yesterday after concluding a six day visit, disagreed with the 
Philippines' views that the EAEC will be a "meaningful bridge" 
between ASEAN and the developed countries. 
  Evans stressed the EAEC, a sub-regional grouping within 
Asia, 
was "potentially divisive." 
  "I think it's very dangerous to the region to develop into 
splits or fissures down the Pacific, as between the North 
American and East Asian economies. We've seen the dangers that 
may be involved in that," Evans explained. 
  Evans cited the recent trade disagreements between the 
United 
States and Japan and the United States and China. He said these 
potential splits within the Asia-Pacific may be transformed into 
wide divisions in the world trade areas if the EAEC pushes 
through. 
  He said that it would be more conducive and productive to 
develop the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which 
brings together trade powers from both sides of the Pacific 
including the United States, China and Japan. 
  Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo disagreed with 
Evans' position, stressing that the EAEC, a concept spearheaded 
by Malaysia, was a "value-added" item to APEC-member countries. 
  Romulo said Evans needs to be educated on the EAEC concept 
so 
that he would understand the positive effects of the forum 
within APEC. 
  The EAEC was conceived as a loose forum for APEC-member 
countries in Asia to discuss achievements gained and informal 
agreements arrived at during the APEC meeting last November in 
Seattle. 
  The EAEC has the support in the ASEAN which groups the 
Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and 
Indonesia. It has invited Japan to the forum but shut its doors 
to the United States and other North American countries . 
  "I guess we need to enlighten (Evans) further," adding he 
was 
informing other EAEC members of Australia's position on the 
issue. 
  Evans, however, supported the Philippines' stand in opposing 
the use of non-trade issues such as human rights and labor 
conditions on developing countries as prerequisites to trade 
relations with rich nations. 
  He stressed that while Australia puts priority in its human 
rights campaign, it shuns the use of this issue as a 
protectionist tool by developed countries such as the United 
States. 
  The United States recently granted its most favored nation 
status on trade to China, although earlier it had contemplated 
tying up the issue with China's human rights record .

  [Text] Another P [Philippine peso] 8.7 billion will be 
pumped into the agriculture and irrigation sectors in the coming 
months as the Ramos government primes up its countryside 
development program. 
  In a statement released yesterday, National Economic and 
Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito 
reported that President Ramos who also heads the NEDA Board has 
given the go signal for the implementation of six infrastructure 
development projects located in the countryside. 
  The largest budgetary outlay of P6.1 billion was earmarked 
for the Arterial Road Links Development Project. 
  Under the project, a total of 327.8 kilometers of arterial 
or 
secondary roads in different parts of the country will be 
cemented. 
  Once completed, 96 percent of the country's arterial road 
network will have been paved, Mr. Habito said. 
  Other projects in the approved package are: 
  -- The P399.8 million Angat Afterbay Regulator Dam which 
involves the rehabilitation of the main diversion structure of 
the Angat-Maasim River Irrigation System that serves about 
28,316 hectares of agricultural lands; 
  -- The P578.1 million Optimum Water Utilization and Rural 
Development Project, which includes the construction of the 
Aganan River Irrigation System to improve farm productivity and 
promote efficient water and land resource utilization through 
the improvement of irrigation facilities, construction of 
post-harvest facilities, and procurement of necessary equipment; 
  -- The P451.1 million Catubig Valley Rural Development 
Project, which will construct and provide agriculture and rural 
infrastructure as well as agricultural support services, flood 
protection and schistosomiasis control; 
  -- The P688.6 million 18th RP [Republic of the Philippines]- 
Japan Increased Food Production Program, under which the 
Japanese Government will provide commodity assistance in the 
form of fertilizers, pesticides, machinery and equipment; and 
  -- The P450 million U.S. Public Law 480 Title I for 1994 for 
the importation of soybean meal for sale to poultry and hog 
raisers and feedmillers in the country. 
  The approval of the projects dovetails with the economic 
thrust of the Ramos administration for agri-based industrial 
development in the different regions and growth areas. 
  At present, more than half of the industrial output of the 
country comes from Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces. 
  It is the medium-term design of government to disperse the 
industrial activities to the countryside. 
  Among the major growth areas being eyed by the Ramos 
Administration are the former U.S. military bases in Subic and 
San Fernando, the Northwestern Luzon growth quadrangle, the 
Cagayan de Oro-Iligan Corridor and the South 
Cotabato-Sarangani-General Santos area.

  [Text] Government and communist rebels have agreed to hold 
the second round of exploratory talks during the third quarter 
this year. The government panel, headed by Ambassador Howard 
Dee and the National Democratic Front (NDF) panel led by Luis 
Jalandoni reached the agreement during a marathon meeting at 
Breukelen, the Netherlands last 10 to 14 June. 
  In a joint statement, Messrs. Jalandoni and Dee said the 
next round of talks will "discuss and agree" on the sequence and 
the functions of different working committees. The reciprocal 
working committees in turn will study and make recommendations 
for the panels in order to forge a lasting peace settlement. 
  The talks were earlier stalled because of several 
misunderstandings on key issues. The NDF had also repeatedly 
questioned the sincerity of the government. 
  Last month, negotiations between two parties almost broke 
apart with the capture of Communist Party of the Philippines 
Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon. After President Ramos ordered 
her release, optimisms were raised on the gesture's effect on 
the talks. 
  Mr. Jalandoni said the talks which ended yesterday resulted 
in the "clarification of issues and perspectives on both sides." 
  Mr. Dee earlier complained about the NDF's hesitance to 
engage in preliminary talks, saying the political wing of the 
communist party failed to communicate with the government panel. 
Mr. Jalandoni said he is pleased with the outcome of the 
preliminary meeting. 
  "The Breukelen meeting is significant step on the long and 
tortuous road towards a just and lasting peace in our country," 
he said. He added the meeting showed the NDF's commitment to 
lasting peace in the country. 
  The two panels also signed a ten-point agreement preparatory 
to the resumption of the second round of talks.

  [Text] The House of Representatives held a meeting at 
Parliament today beginning at 1350. It was expected that the 
motion sponsored by Phalang Tham Party MPs proposing a special 
committee to redraft the Constitution would be taken up for 
discussion. 
  Before proceeding with the items on the agenda, which were 
already scrutinized by the house committees, the chairman of the 
session informed MPs that the Chat Phatthana Party requested the 
withdrawal of its motion on setting up a special committee to 
study guidelines to formulate a master plan for political 
reforms. The party said it wanted to make improvements on the 
proposal. The meeting approved the party's request. The 
chairman then asked whether any MP's would like to propose any 
other items for discussion, or proceed with items on the agenda. 
  The motion which the Chat Phatthana Party requested to 
withdraw was tabled as the 26th item, an urgent motion. The 
motion sponsored by Phalang Tham MP's was placed as the 28th 
item on the list. The fact that nobody proposed to move the 
motion up for discussion by the House of Representatives 
indicated that it would not be discussed today. And if it is 
debated according to the line on the agenda, the motion risks 
not being discussed at all during the present House session 
which is scheduled to recess by the end of July. 
  The House today discussed a report prepared by the committee 
in charge of holding celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary 
of the King's reign in 1996. MP's discussed the plan 
extensively from noon until evening. Most of those who took the 
floor proposed that the government hold celebrations worth the 
honor of His Majesty the King so that all people can take part 
in the campaign which should include activities which will 
benefit the general public. The House session continued until 
1800. 
  During the session, a delegation led by the deputy speaker 
of 
the House of Representatives of Kuwait visited parliament. The 
group is currently on a visit to Thailand until 19 June.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Day of Madness and Treachery"] </F>
  [Text] It was the ultimate anti-climax, probably the 
biggest twist of the year. The protest for constitutional reform 
by Chalat Worachat which began with a big bang ended with just a 
heart-breaking whimper. 
  After three weeks of tension and political cliff-hanging, 
the 
abrupt end of the protest by supporters of hunger striker Chalat 
last night and his decision to give himself up to police to face 
a lese majeste charge left observers almost dumbstruck. The 
surprise turn of events also left a host of questions that beg 
answers, particularly from Chalat himself and from the so-called 
Organisation for Political Reform. 
  Have all the tireless efforts of Chalat's sympathisers and 
democratic aspirants for constitutional and political reform 
gone down the drain? Was this melodrama which had been played 
out in a deadly serious fashion merely a carefully-plotted 
political charade to fool the entire nation just for the sake of 
fun. If so it was not funny at all given the damages, which are 
yet to be estimated, already inflicted on our economy and on our 
investment climate. Or was it, after all, typical Thai politics 
which is unique in itself? Or has political sanity finally made 
a comeback to our childishly insensible political world? 
  Although puzzled or disappointed by the twist, quite a few 
will certainly sigh in great relief now that the protest is over 
and the situation about to return to normal. For the Democrats, 
the unexpected event constituted a double triumph in a single 
day and it will certainly give them good, although unjustified, 
cause for celebration. 
  It would be nice to be able to give credit to someone for 
bringing this unfortunate political event to a peaceful end. 
But there is no one that deserves the credit, not even Chalat 
himself who may well have instigated his own political demise by 
the sudden about face, for which he owes many of his supporters 
and sympathisers a reasonable explanation. He cannot take any 
credit and neither can the Democrats nor the Phalang Tham [PTP]. 
  The Democrats have shown without any doubt that they had no 
intention whatsoever of ending the crisis despite the fact that 
it could probably have been resolved peacefully yesterday had 
the PTP rebels' motion for a panel to write a new charter been 
allowed to move forward, debated in Parliament and endorsed with 
the support of the Opposition. Yet, the Democrats chose to 
scuttle the motion and thus allowed the crisis to continue, at 
least until next Thursday when the House reconvenes. 
  The adjournment of the parliamentary session by Deputy House 
Speaker Wan Muhamat Nomatha until next week which effectively 
blocked the motion was not coincidental, but plotted in advance 
in collaboration with the New Aspiration Party. This coup de 
grace is proof positive of the Democrats' political intrigue and 
treachery which are unequalled by their fellow MPs in the other 
parties. It is a special craft learned, nurtured and honed from 
decades of political experience by the Democrats. 
  A victory and the sense of joy that goes with it, even 
temporarily, seems to be what the Democrats craved for, 
regardless of the cost that this country will be made to pay. If 
common sense and political sanity still prevail among the 
Democrats who seem to be blinded by their arrogance and 
stubbornness, the crisis should have ended with the Democrats 
rightfully claiming the credit. Yet, they knowingly and 
intentionally allowed the opportunity to slip past. 
  After all, there are no real winners in this political 
charade. There are only losers -- and the real losers are 
undoubtedly the people in general. 
  The unsavory political events in and out of Parliament 
yesterday were simply too much to digest, even by Thai 
standards. It was the ultimate in absurdity and defied all 
reason. 
  Where do the people get their hopes from now after the end 
of 
this farce? What trust is there for a government which is only 
good at political manoeuvring and intrigue, but which has failed 
completely in national administration? Can we still place our 
hope and the destiny of this country in the hands of the same 
incompetent politicians a year, a month or a week longer? 
  It's time we asked ourselves loudly whether we want a new 
hope -- perhaps a better future -- through a general election or 
should we just let ourselves go down the drain with this sinking 
ship of state?

<F P=106> ["Dangerous Nuclear Design" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign 
Minister, Koji Kakizawa, recently said "in view of the actual 
conditions of international politics, it is hard to state the 
use of nuclear weapons is a total violation of the international 
law," while the Japanese Government supported the super power's 
doctrine of "nuclear deterrent," contending that "it is 
impossible to deny even the nuclear deterrent by totally denying 
nuclear weapons." 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that what Japan seeks in 
accelerating nuclear armament is, in the long run, to use 
nuclear weapons as a means of realising its dominationist 
ambition. 
  It is a very grave development that the Japanese Government 
says "yes" to the use of nuclear weapons, the analyst says, and 
continues: 
  This sounds a note of warning that if Japan's nuclear 
armament were not checked, it would bring a serious disaster to 
mankind. 
  In actuality, the Japanese Government has stockpiled a large 
quantity of plutonium, seeking to convert Japan into a nuclear 
power. It launched even a space rocket capable of delivering 
nuclear warheads. This bespeaks that all the regions of the 
world are within Japan's nuclear range. 
  Japan, which is seeking the repetition of its past policy of 
aggression, will make no scruple of plunging the Asian people 
into a nuclear disaster for the purpose of conquering Asia and 
restoring its old colonial empire. 
  If the Japanese reactionaries, captive to reinvasion 
ambition, think that they will get scotfree after using nuclear 
weapons, it is a mistake. 
  Japan's nuclear armament and use of nuclear weapons will 
drive it to destruction.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 (KNS-KCNA) -- A symposium took place 
in Tokyo under the auspices of the Society of Koreans in Japan 
for Social and Legal Studies under the Association of Korean 
Social Scientists in Japan to expose the essence and injustice 
of the Japanese authorities' crackdown on Osaka and Kyoto 
organizations of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon). 
  Speakers at the symposium were unanimous in saying the 
crackdown cases were by no means accidental and they were 
absolutely deliberate and premeditated human rights abuses 
committed against the background of their malicious anti-DPRK, 
anti-Chongnyon campaign, and illegal acts of political 
suppression, and a typical national chauvinistic crime. 
  They said there is no change in the Korea policy of the 
Japanese government authorities resorting to anti-DPRK moves to 
isolate and stifle it on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear 
issue" and that the Japanese authorities' suppression of 
Chongnyon organizations was completely illegal from the legal 
point of view.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- Grint, an expert of the 
International Relations Institute of Britain, said that it is a 
big mistake to think "sanctions" can bring North Korea to its 
knees, according to Radio Voice of America on June 11. 
  He said that 30 years have passed since the United States 
took a step for a total trade embargo against Cuba, but it has 
still failed to overthrow Cuba. 
  North Korea has undergone more strict trade embargo 
sanctions 
by the United States for nearly 50 years than Cuba, he said, 
adding: 
  In fact, North Korea is a communist state subjected to 
pressure and sanctions of the U.S. and the West for the longest 
period. Therefore, North Koreans will never be frightened by any 
"sanctions".

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- Stanley Faulkner, 
vice-chairman of the International Liaison Committee for 
Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco), in a letter sent to 
the president of the United Nations General Assembly recently 
with regard to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, urged 
the implementation of the resolution of the 30th session of the 
UN General Assembly adopted in 1975, saying countries producing 
nuclear weapons have been increasing tensions against North 
Korea. Noting that, no matter in which country they may be, 
nuclear weapons pose a threat to peace, the letter stressed they 
are contrary to the mission of the United Nations. 
  It contended that the DPRK and the United States should sit 
at the negotiating table and settle the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula through dialogue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Kye Ung-tae, Politburo 
member and secretary of the C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK 
[Workers' Party of Korea], took the floor at a national seminar 
held here Thursday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 
start of work by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  He said: 
  On June 19, 1964 dear Comrade Kim Chong-il began to guide 
the 
party work at the party Central Committee, complying with the 
ardent desire and organisational will of the whole party and the 
entire people for him to lead in the van the sacred revolution 
to carry forward the cause of the respected leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song. With this great event our party has become a 
revolutionary party which successfully solved the question of 
inheriting the leader's cause for the first time in history. 
  With the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il standing at the 
head of the party, a great heyday has come in the building of 
our party and accomplishment of the revolutionary cause in the 
past 30 years, our party and people have been able to vigorously 
carry forward the revolutionary idea and feats of the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, our party has been able to exalt a 
glorious revolutionary party successfully carrying on the 
revolution for the independence of the popular masses under the 
banner of modelling the whole party and society on the chuche 
idea. 
  The dear leader clarified that the most correct way for the 
building of socialism and communism in our era is to dye the 
whole party and society with the chuche idea, the revolutionary 
idea of the great leader correctly reflecting the independent 
demand and interest of the popular masses. 
  An unprecedented change has taken place in all fields of 
socialist construction in a historically short period in our 
country under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il who has steadfastly turned the helm of revolution and 
construction to modelling the whole party and society on the 
chuche idea. 
  Under his wise guidance the work of modelling the whole 
party 
on the chuche idea has been stepped up, so that the features of 
our party as a great party have been fundamentally changed, its 
militancy and leadership role remarkably strengthened and the 
whole party and the entire people have formed an integral whole 
rallied close around the leader in an organisational and 
ideological way. 
  A great turn has taken place in socialist economic 
construction, cultural building and revolutionary armed force 
building as the driving force of our revolution has been 
strengthened and its role enhanced under the party's leadership. 
  Today the economy of our country has been more firmly 
consolidated as the socialist independent national economy, 
unaffected by any worldwide economic fluctuation and any 
economic blockade of the imperialists, and magnificent creations 
glorifying the Workers' Party era built in succession across the 
country to fundamentally change the features of the country. 
  Along with this, a great heyday of chuche-based literature 
and art has been brought by the rapid development of socialist 
national culture. 
  Under the energetic leadership of respected Supreme 
Commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il the modelling of the whole Army on the 
chuche idea has been propelled and thus our People's Army has 
grown up to be a true army of the party unfailingly loyal to the 
party and the leader and acting as one under the party's 
leadership and to be an unrivalled strong army equipped with 
powerful offensive and defensive means enough to defeat any 
aggressor at one stroke. 
  The immortal feats of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
who has ushered in the great heyday in building our party and 
carrying out the revolutionary cause with his profound 
revolutionary idea and great revolutionary practice will shine 
forever down through generations along with the history of the 
revolutionary struggle of the popular masses for independence.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Kim Ki-nam, secretary 
of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the Workers' Party of 
Korea[WPK], made a speech at the national seminar held here 
Thursday upon the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il began working at the C.C., the WPK. 
  He said the main fruition of the leadership of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il over the past three decades since he 
began to work at the WPK Central Committee is that he has 
strengthened and developed the WPK to be an ever-victorious 
revolutionary party of chuche type and to be authoritative 
vanguard of the world socialist movement standing in the 
foreground of modern history. 
  Noting that the dear leader's idea and theory of party 
building are the immortal banner of the building of the 
revolutionary party of chuche type, he said: 
  His idea and theory of party building serve as the guideline 
that, first of all, indicates the most correct way of building 
the working-class party as a leading political organization for 
realising the idea and guidance of the leader. 
  The dear leader gave the famous formulation that the 
working-class party is, in essence, the party of the leader, 
basing himself on the stark fact that the WPK was founded and 
has been strengthened and developed by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and on the principle of the chuche 
philosophy that the oneness of the ideology, leadership and 
unity must be ensured in the socio-political organism with the 
leader, its brain, in the centre. 
  Having formulated the essence and mission of the 
working-class party with the leader in the centre, he set it as 
the fundamental principle of party building to establish a 
monolithic ideological system in the whole party, thus becoming 
the first in history to indicate a correct way of building the 
party as the leader's. 
  His idea and theory of party building are a guideline that 
shows the most correct way of building the working-class party 
as a genuine party of the people which assumes responsibility 
for their destiny and serves them. 
  The working-class party is necessary for the people and only 
when it is united with the people in one mind, it has viability 
-- this is the basic stand of the dear leader toward the party 
building. 
  The dear leader has established chuche-based principles and 
mode of politics with benevolent politics and magnanimous 
politics as the main point and gave a full exposition of the 
revolutionary method of party work and popular working style. 
  The immortal significance of his idea and theory of party 
building also lies in that they are the guideline which 
indicates the most correct way of building the working-class 
party as an independent and creative party. 
  The dear leader has held high the banner of chuche, the 
banner of independence and creation in party building and party 
activities, wholly inheriting the idea and will of the respected 
leader President Kim Il-song, who had hewn the path of 
independence and creation under the banner of the great chuche 
idea. 
  With the dear leader's idea and theory of building an 
independent and creative party successfully realized, the WPK 
has been strengthened and developed to be the most dignified and 
authoritative party of chuche that maintains our way in the 
organizational and ideological work and in the establishment of 
leadership art and shapes and carries out the revolutionary line 
and policies of the party in our way. 
  Indeed, the dear leader's idea and theory of party building 
are an ideological and theoretical summing up of the historical 
experience and lesson gained in the communist movement in the 
20th century and the building of working-class party and an 
immortal banner of the revolutionary party building in the era 
of chuche.
