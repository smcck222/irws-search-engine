  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Han Song-yong, member 
of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee 
of the Workers' Party of Korea, made a speech at the national 
seminar held in Pyongyang on June 16 to commemorate the 30th 
anniversary of the start of work by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  The speaker elaborated on the wise leadership of the dear 
leader in establishing the monolithic leadership system of the 
party. 
  He said: 
  "The dear leader has energetically directed a substantial 
work of laying solid foundations of the party, putting the main 
stress on the cultivation of loyalty among the cadres, party 
members and other working people and on the defence of the 
centre of unity and leadership, that are carried forward through 
generations, thus successfully carrying out the difficult and 
complicated work of establishing the monolithic leadership 
system of the party in the whole party and society. 
  "The establishment of the party's monolithic leadership 
system over the revolution and construction in our country is a 
great historic event which provided a decisive guarantee for 
winning the final victory of the socialist cause. 
  "It, above all, gave a fundamental guarantee for carrying 
out 
socialist construction in our country strictly as intended and 
desired by the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  "Today the Korean people are unswervingly advancing 
socialist 
construction in accordance with the idea and intention of the 
great leader entirely because the party's monolithic leadership 
system over the revolution and construction has been firmly 
established. 
  "The establishment of this monolithic leadership system also 
provided a firm guarantee for victoriously advancing socialist 
construction by enhancing the party's leading role. 
  "The dear leader has converted the whole party and society 
into invincible units with strong organisation and discipline, 
which act as one under the unitary leadership of the leader. 
  "Thanks to the thorough establishment of the monolithic 
leadership system of the party by the dear leader, the 
politico-ideological strength of our society based on the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses has 
grown greater than ever before to provide a strong motive force 
of socialist construction, enhance the revolutionary zeal and 
creative enthusiasm of the people day by day, effect a constant 
revolutionary upsurge in all domains of socialist construction, 
and organise and mobilize the human and material forces of the 
whole country in a uniform, intensive and planned way in 
implementing the line and policies of the party." Ithe speaker 
stressed that the destiny of the socialist cause of ohe Korean 
people is staked on the monolithic leadership system of the 
party, which is the source of its sure victory.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il on June 15 sent a benevolent centenary birthday 
table to Yun Chin-ok residing in Kim Chaek City, North Hamgyong 
Province. 
  Born into a fisherman's family, she was subjected to all 
manner of maltreatment and humiliation in the period of the 
feudal rule and during the harsh Japanese imperialist rule. She 
could enjoy a happy life after the liberation of the country 
and, now, has attained the age of 100 years thanks to the 
popular health policy of the party and the state. 
  She is still in good health with a family of more than 50.

  [Excerpts] Hanoi, June 17 (AFP) -- Vietnam on Friday 
hardened its stance against China in the war of words over the 
South China Sea, saying Beijing had illegally given a US firm 
oil prospecting rights in a Vietnamese area that was not even 
part of the disputed Spratly Islands. 
  In response to Chinese accusations that Vietnam had been 
harassing its oil survey vessels, a Foreign Ministry statement 
said the area in question was entirely within Vietnam's 
exclusive economic zone and had been never been part of the 
Spratly Islands. 
  The statement implicitly denied any harassment of Chinese 
vessels, saying that Vietnam had only been carrying out 
legitimate survey work completely within its rights. 
  "China should not make declarations or carry out acts that 
violate Vietnam's incontestable sovereignty over this area," the 
statement said, adding that this would not help efforts to 
improve relations or secure peace in the region. 
  Vietnam has accused China of acting illegally by granting 
Crestone Energy Corp. a concession to explore in a huge swathe 
of the South China Sea that includes what the Vietnamese call 
the Tu Chinh area. 
  "Declarations that the Tu Chinh area lies within the 
maritime 
zone of the Spratly Islands and China's signature of an oil 
exploration contract with Crestone run contrary to legal 
principles and international conventions, in particular the 1982 
Law of the Sea," the statement said. 
  Vietnam's parliament is expected to ratify the UN maritime 
law during its session this month in a move seen as boosting 
Hanoi's legal arsenal in the dispute. [passage omitted covered 
by referent item] 
  Both sides have repeatedly pledged to resolve the dispute 
over the Spratly and Paracel islands through negotiations and 
avoid a repetition of the brief naval clash they fought in 1988. 
  But stepped up oil exploration across the area and new 
technology that enables oil firms to drill cheaper wells in deep 
waters is threatening to complicate the problem. 
  Oil firms here have downplayed the risk of confrontation, 
saying that they are more concerned over whether the promising 
geology under the South China Sea will actually yield commercial 
quantities of oil and gas. 
  "You're not going to see gunboats out there firing at each 
other," said one oil executive who insisted on anonymity, adding 
that he thought the dispute was mostly "shadow playing."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- North Korea will propose a 
compromise package to the United States to solve the nuclear 
confrontation if Washington agrees to resume bilateral talks, a 
Japanese politician Friday quoted a senior North Korean official 
as saying. 
  Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the (North) Korean Workers' Party 
in charge of international affairs, told Taku Yamasaki, a 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet member, late Thursday the 
package would incorporate "all points of concern for the United 
States," Yamasaki told reporters in a phone call from Pyongyang. 
  "If U.S.-N. Korea talks are reopened, we are ready to 
propose 
a lump compromise package regarding the nuclear issue, through 
which everything will be solved," Kim said in a four-hour 
meeting with Yamasaki, a former director general of the Defense 
Agency. 
  Pyongyang would offer to give up its current nuclear 
facilities if the U.S. helps North Korea to replace its 
graphite-moderated reactor program with light-water reactors, as 
the U.S. has previously offered to do. 
  Alluding to U.S. calls for sanctions against North Korea for 
its refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities, Kim 
warned against putting further pressure on Pyongyang. 
  "We cannot allow others to keep punching us," he was quoted 
as saying. 
  Yamasaki and LDP Diet member Yoichi Tani, a former head of 
the Hokkaido Development Agency, who also participated in the 
talks, urged Kim to seek a negotiated solution of the nuclear 
row. 
  "We strongly hope that North Korea will resolve its 
differences with the United States and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency with the wisdom of an upright man," they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher telephoned Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
early Friday morning [17 Jun] to inform him in advance of U.S. 
plans to issue an announcement on the North Korean nuclear 
situation, Kakizawa said. 
  Christopher called at around 5 A.M. [2000 GMT] to report in 
advance the contents of U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
announcement giving a tentative go-ahead to the reopening of 
diplomatic talks with North Korea, Kakizawa said at a press 
conference. 
  Kakizawa said he told Christopher Japan welcomes Washington 
seeking dialogue with Pyongyang and hopes North Korea will 
respond to the U.S. offer and accept and carry out international 
inspections of nuclear facilities. 
  Japan also hopes North Korea would offer a "sincere" reply 
to 
the call from the United States on Friday when former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter meets North Korean Leader Kim Il-song 
again because this is an important turning point toward 
sanctions, Kakizawa said. 
  Clinton announced U.S. willingness to open the third round 
of 
negotiations with Pyongyang at a press conference Thursday, 
saying there was "promising development" in Carter's personal 
mission in Pyongyang. 
  Carter, speaking on the CNN cable network from Pyongyang 
after a meeting Thursday with Kim, said he has received a 
personal commitment from the North Korean leader that 
international inspectors will be allowed to continue monitoring 
a controversial nuclear reactor in Yongbyon north of the North 
Korean capital. 
  Kakizawa quoted Christopher as saying the U.S. can not yet 
determine whether North Korea's latest overtures were "sincere" 
or a strategy to procrastinate moves toward imposing sanctions 
on Pyongyang. 
  Christopher was quoted as saying that negotiations at the 
United Nations on the proposed sanctions will continue. 
  Kakizawa said he telephoned Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
after 
the 30-minute call with Christopher.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Defense Agency chief 
Atsushi Kanda denied Friday that a U.S. study for possible use 
of Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) bases is linked to the 
current crisis over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Kanda admitted at a news conference the U.S. forces are 
conducting a study with Japanese bases, but stressed it has 
nothing to do with the deepening Asia-Pacific crisis. 
  "We have been conducting research and studies (on Japanese 
bases) to secure efficient operation in view of maintaining and 
boosting reliability of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," he 
said. 
  "Japan's Self-Defense Forces have been cooperating with 
these 
studies, and (the ongoing study) is one in line with them," 
Kanda said. "The U.S. forces are always doing (such studies). 
The study now under way has nothing to do with the North Korean 
issue." 
  The daily TOKYO SHIMBUN reported in its Friday edition that 
the U.S. forces are studying Air Self-Defense Force bases for 
possible use as airbases for fighters apparently in preparation 
for any military involvement in the Korean peninsula. 
  The U.S. appears to have already selected four bases in 
Chitose, Misawa, Matsushima and Komatsu as proper sites to serve 
as bases for U.S. fighters which would fly from the U.S. 
mainland, the daily said. 
  Kanda denied he has received any request from the U.S. for 
such use of Japanese bases. 
  The U.S. forces conduct studies on SDF bases to renew data 
once or twice every year, according to the Defense Agency.

  [Text] At a news conference this morning, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai commented on President Bill Clinton's 
remark earlier in the morning on the United States' willingness 
to resume talks with the DPRK. He said: 
  [Begin Kumagai recording] We welcome the present move toward 
the U.S.-DPRK talks. We would like to continue to maintain 
close cooperation with the countries concerned to strongly urge 
North Korea to demonstrate by its actual behavior that it 
observes the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and will fully 
implement the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
safeguards agreement. [end recording] 
  Kumagai also said that until the DPRK accepts nuclear 
inspections, it is necessary to consider various measures, 
including sanctions, at the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Asahikawa, Hokkaido, June 17 KYODO -- Former Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Friday [17 June] warned against 
overreaction by parties involved in the North Korean nuclear 
standoff. 
  Speaking to a gathering in Asahikawa on Japan's northernmost 
main island of Hokkaido, Kaifu said overreaction on the part of 
either North Korea or countries advocating sanctions against it 
could lead to a great setback for the international community. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) figure advised 
that all diplomatic efforts be exerted, making use of various 
personalities and channels, so that the dispute can be resolved 
through peaceful dialogue.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- A pro-Pyongyang of Koreans 
living in Japan said Wednesday [15 June] it will urge police to 
probe and take preventive measures against the growing number of 
discriminatory acts they are encountering [sentence as received]. 
  The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon) announced the move after issuing a statement showing 
some 120 discriminatory cases reported since April. The cases 
include verbal abuse and physical harassment such as knifing of 
clothing worn by Korean students. Female students of schools 
run by Chongnyon wear traditional Korean clothes for uniforms, 
which could make them a target. 
  Chongnyon called the situation "vicious violence," comparing 
it to the aftermath of the 1923 great Kanto earthquake, in which 
many Koreans were killed. Chongnyon officials told a news 
conference that discriminatory actions have noticeably increased 
since March in line with the international focus on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. The number of such 
actions reported to Chongnyon's Tokyo headquarters totaled about 
25 in April, but jumped to about 45 in May and some 50 for the 
first half of June, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Japan-Korea Friendship 
Association on Thursday [16 June] urged Japanese municipalities 
to recognize the political rights of Korean residents of Japan 
and abolish citizenship requirements for working in local 
governments. 
  The association at its general assembly adopted a resolution 
urging Japan to open the way for political participation of 
Korean residents at the regional level and to expand the 
employment of ethnic Koreans in public administration. 
  "Korean residents of Japan are now second, third, and fourth 
generations and have adopted the lifestyle of permanently 
residing in Japan," Shin Yon-sang, head of the pro-Seoul Korean 
Residents Union in Japan (Mindan), told the assembly. 
  "As local residents of Japanese society, I hope they will 
contribute to the development of the regions. We intend to 
proceed with our efforts to gain political participation rights 
on the local level," Shin said. 
  The campaign for granting voting rights and the right to run 
for political office at the local level to ethnic Koreans has 
gained momentum over the past year as a growing number of local 
assemblies have adopted resolutions backing political rights for 
non-Japanese permanent residents. 
  Some 680,000 ethnic Koreans currently live in Japan, many of 
them descendants of Korean laborers forcibly brought to Japan 
during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the peninsula. 
  An estimated 369,000 of the residents are affiliated with 
the 
pro-Seoul Mindan while another 247,000 belong to the 
pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon).

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan has yet to fix a 
schedule for Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's expected visit to 
South Korea, the top government spokesman said Friday [17 June]. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam expressed a desire to 
meet Hata as early as possible during Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa's recent visit to South Korea, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi kumagai said at a news conference. 
  "But nothing has yet been decided concerning when and how" 
the premier will make the journey, he said. 
  On Thursday, a senior Foreign Ministry official indicated 
Hata may visit South Korea for talks with Kim later this month 
or early next month. 
  A newspaper report said Friday the government has started 
preparations for a visit by Hata to South Korea on July 1-2. 
  It would be Hata's first visit to South Korea since assuming 
office in late April. The premier has voiced hope for an early 
visit to South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will likely hold subcabinet-level talks on telecommunications 
trade around June 22 and 23, a Foreign Ministry official said 
Thursday [16 June]. 
  The official was briefing reporters after the end of the 
first-day session of two-day working-level telecom trade talks 
in Tokyo. Both sides avoided discussing the quantitative aspect 
of "objective criteria" in gauging the openness of Japan's 
telecom market, the official said. Friday's session will also 
refrain from addressing quantitative criteria, the thorniest 
issue under the bilateral trade "framework" negotiations, he 
said. 
  Talks on improving U.S. access to the Japanese telecom 
market 
resumed in early June after a hiatus of three and half months 
following the Feb. 11 disruption of the summit talks between 
then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
are unlikely to reach accord on all of the three priority fields 
under the trade "framework" talks before the Naples summit of 
the Group of Seven key industrial countries in July, Trade 
Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday [17 June]. 
  Settlement on auto trade talks will probably be delayed 
beyond the July 8-10 summit, International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hata told a press conference. 
  But he added Japan could reach accord on "the overall 
direction" of bilateral auto trade during a meeting between 
Prime Minister Tstutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton to 
be held along with the Naples summit. 
  Japan previously expressed hope that talks on auto trade and 
two other priority framework sectors -- government procurement 
and insurance -- will be settled before the Naples G-7 meeting. 
  "There should be flexibility in bilateral framework 
negotiations," Hata said. 
  On Japan's economy, Hata said "the biggest concern" is a 
strong yen. 
  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno depicted a brighter 
economic prospect in his latest press conference amid an 
emerging sign of a recovery in various industrial sectors, Hata 
said. 
  But he added small companies are still struggling under the 
lingering uptrend of the yen against the dollar.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Thursday [16 June] agreed to continue efforts to expand 
foreign access to Japan's sheet glass market, a Trade Ministry 
official said. 
  The two countries confirmed the mutual efforts during sheet 
glass talks resumed under the trade "Framework" negotiations, an 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) told a press conference. "Both parties agreed to 
continue constructive talks for further penetration by imported 
sheet glass in this country," the official said. The official 
noted the two parties agreed to meet again in July or shortly 
after the Naples summit of the group of seven leading 
industrialized nations. 
  During Thursday's meeting, the first since December last 
year, Japanese negotiators explained that the volume-based share 
of foreign-made sheet glass in the Japanese market increased to 
5.6 percent in 1993 from 4.9 percent the previous year, 
according to the official. The Japanese negotiators were also 
quoted as saying the number of Japanese wholesalers handling 
foreign sheet glass rose to 39 at the end of last December from 
17 in June 1992. At present, there are 400 sheet glass 
wholesalers in Japan. 
  The Japanese side said it has taken steps to open Japan's 
sheet glass market in line with an action plan introduced two 
years ago, the official said. The Japanese sheet glass industry 
will send a trade mission to the U.S. in August to study the 
U.S. distribution system, according to the official. 
  Sheet glass trade is among a basket of existing trade pacts 
under the framework talks. The trade talks were launched in 
September last year, and held in October and December. But the 
talks were suspended following the Feb. 11 collapse of the 
summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The annual summits of the 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries have reached "an 
important crossroads" following the end of the Cold War, 
according to senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official Koichiro 
Matsuura. 
  The invitation to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to 
the G-7 summit in London in 1991 marked the diplomatic end to 
the Cold War structure, said Matsuura, former deputy foreign 
minister for economic affairs, in a recent interview with KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE. "But the G-7 nations have yet to form a consensus 
on what role their summits, marking their 20th anniversary at 
this year's Naples gathering, should play in the post-Cold War 
era," he said. The East-West confrontation of the 1970s and the 
first oil crisis in 1973 were prime movers in launching the 
summits, Matsuura said. "But now there is nothing that binds 
them together so firmly," he claimed. "They are now in a 
transitional stage." 
  Matsuura served as a sherpa, or personal representative of 
the prime minister, at the 1992 Munich summit and the 1993 Tokyo 
summit. He said the G-7 countries are having difficulty dealing 
with Russia, which has stumbled in implementing reform programs 
despite full- fledged aid commitment by the G-7 at last year's 
Tokyo summit. "How to define Russia's role in the summit 
framework will probably be taken up at the Naples summit," he 
said. "But G-7 leaders are unlikely to reach an accord on the 
matter and the topic will be carried into next year's summit in 
Canada." He said Russia appears to want to use its 
participation at the summit to give the world the impression it 
is an economic power. 
  Matsuura said the G-7 nations have effectively tackled trade 
and currency issues throughout the past 19 summit meetings, 
which began at Rambouillet, France, in 1975. He said a floating 
exchange rate system has come to function well, while new global 
trade rules are expected to take effect at the beginning of next 
year under the World Trade Organization (WTO) following the 
recent conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade 
talks. But macroeconomic issues, which Matsuura claims are "far 
more difficult" to cope with than currency and trade problems, 
are still pending, necessitating further policy coordination 
among the G-7. Matsuura said the Naples summit will give 
priority to how to achieve growth and employment simultaneously, 
an issue also discussed at the Tokyo summit under the "global 
growth strategy." 
  The economy is recovering smoothly in the United States 
while 
signs of a pickup are appearing in Japan, but this does not mean 
that global unemployment will be easily solved, he said. Global 
joblessness can be partly traced to structural problems that 
often require political solutions, he added. 
  Directly or indirectly, Japan will probably be asked to 
boost 
its domestic demand during the Naples summit as part of efforts 
to reduce global unemployment. But it is unlikely there will be 
any magic prescription for dealing with structural problems on 
the jobless issue, he said. 
  On the political front, Bosnia will top the Naples agenda in 
view of its geographical proximity to most summit member 
countries. The suspected nuclear arms program by North Korea 
could also be taken up if the situation becomes more serious, 
Matsuura said.

be able to revise its charter before 1996 to allow Japan to 
become a permanent member of its security council, former 
Japanese ambassador to the UN Yoshio Hatano predicted Thursday 
[16 June]. 
  Hatano also said in a speech that a midterm report on UN 
reform by a working committee, due this fall, will not detail an 
increase in the number of UN Security Council members. He said 
it would be impossible for the 184-nation working panel to 
produce an agreement.

  [Text] Dhaka, June 15 KYODO -- Japan will provide 22.97 
billion yen to Bangladesh under two loan agreements signed here 
Tuesday [14 June] between the two countries, the government said. 
  The main loan of 21.56 billion yen is for the construction 
of 
the Jamuna multipurpose bridge project, the Bangladesh 
Government said in a press release. The remaining 1.41 million 
yen loan is for financing a separate development project. 
  The bridge is being cofinanced by the World Bank and the 
Asian Development Bank, which are giving 200 million dollars 
each, the government said. 
  With the loan agreements signed Tuesday, the total amount of 
assistance to Bangladesh from Japan's Overseas Economic 
Cooperation Fund (OECF) comes to 481.59 billion yen, the OECF 
local office said in a press release. 
  The 4.8-kilometer-long bridge will carry electricity and gas 
lines as well as traffic, and will have telecommunications 
facilities in future. The bridge will be a great link between 
the two parts of Bangladesh divided by the Jamuna River and is 
expected to help spur economic growth, the OECF said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
acknowledged Friday that Japan has the capability to produce 
nuclear weapons but said it has not done so in line with its 
international treaty obligations. "It's certainly the case that 
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not 
made them," Hata told reporters inside the Diet building. 
  He said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its 
obligations as a nonnuclear power under the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Hata made the comment in 
connection with an alleged remark he made in a House of 
Councillors Budget Committee meeting earlier in the day. 
  The prime minister was quoted by parliamentarians as having 
said he "agrees absolutely" with an interpellator's view that 
Japan should confirm to other nations that it can indeed produce 
nuclear weapons, though it is refraining from doing so for 
political reasons. The interpellator, Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) Hiroshi Oki, cited the NPT and Japan's so-called three 
nonnuclear principles -- to not possess, manufacture or 
introduce nuclear weapons on its territory. 
  Hata denied to reporters that he made the alleged remark, 
though Oki insisted the prime minister "roundly affirmed" 
Japan's potential for producing nuclear weapons. It is believed 
to be the first time for the Japanese Government to directly 
acknowledge such potential in the Diet or publicly. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai called Hata's 
remarks 
a somewhat insufficient explanation of the government's true 
position. He told reporters that Japan "limits its use of 
nuclear energy to peaceful purposes, abstains from military 
utilization and does not endeavor to possess nuclear weapons 
technology or know-how."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The Agency of Natural 
Resources and Energy has instructed Tokyo Electric Power Co. to 
thoroughly investigate last month's accident at one of the 
company's nuclear reactors in Fukushima Prefecture, agency 
officials said Friday [17 June]. 
  The agency, part of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, suspects the metal fittings holding down jet pumps in 
Japan's boiling-water reactors may be defective after it learned 
that the fittings had been replaced in the early 1980s to 
prevent just such an accident. 
  Operations at the Fukushima No. 2 power plant's 
1,100-megawatt third reactor were closed down on May 30 when 
part of a metal fitting on one of the 20 jet pumps that regulate 
power output fell off. 
  Concern about the fittings 14 years ago, following a similar 
accident at a U.S. nuclear power facility, led Tokyo Electric 
Power to change the fittings on all its boiling-water reactors 
as a preventive measure. 
  According to the agency, the accident at an Illinois nuclear 
power plant in February 1980 was attributed to stress and 
corrosion around the holes for bolts that hold the jet pumps in 
place. 
  The power company replaced all the fittings in its reactors 
with a new type that was supposedly more resistant to stress and 
corrosion. The exchange operation was completed in 1984. 
  Since then, there have been no reports of any accidents 
related to the fittings, but the effects of stress and corrosion 
have been found at the Fukushima No. 1 power plant's first 
reactor and at the Hamaoka power plant's first reactor in 
Shizuoka Prefecture. 
  The Fukushima reactor, currently under investigation, was 
under construction at the time of the exchange operations and 
was installed with the newer-style fittings. 
  The same Fukushima reactor experienced trouble with its 
circulating-water pump in January 1989 and at that time, the jet 
pumps were removed from the reactor. 
  The agency suggested that the trouble with the metal 
fittings 
on the jet pumps may be related to the 1989 incident, but added 
that if trouble exists with the newer-style fittings, it may 
have to order the fittings on the boiling-water reactors be 
changed again. 
  The majority of Japan's nuclear power reactors are of the 
boiling-water type. An exception is the "Monju" reactor in 
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture along the coast of the Sea of Japan. 
It is a plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor, which has become 
the cornerstone of Japan's energy policies for the future.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said Thursday 
[16 June] his party will submit a no-confidence motion against 
the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  "We will submit a no-confidence motion against Hata 
cabinet," 
Kono told a faction meeting of LDP legislators at a Tokyo 
restaurant. "We cannot overlook this cabinet in silence." 
  Kono, however, did not state clearly when the LDP will take 
the action. 
  As the current Diet session approaches its final day June 
29, 
the LDP is intensifying its pressure on the government, 
threatening to submit a no-confidence motion at any time. 
  If the LDP secures enough support from the second largest 
opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, the passage of 
the motion is likely, resulting in either the cabinet's 
resignation en masse or Hata's calling a general election.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided Friday [17 June] to 
propose a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata as soon as the 1994 budget passes the Diet, party sources 
said. 
  The 73.08 trillion yen budget was approved by the House of 
Representatives on June 8 and is expected to clear the House of 
Councillors during the current session ending June 29. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono wants to meet at an early stage 
with 
Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan], and 
Masayoshi Takemura, head of New Party Sakigake (harbinger), to 
ask for cooperation on the planned no-confidence motion, they 
said. 
  Hata is not deserving of confidence, the sources said, 
because his minority government does not represent the will of 
the people. 
  The LDP also criticizes the ruling coalition for having lost 
credibility in international society as well by its reluctance 
to uncover the facts about questionable financial deals by 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the sources said. 
  If a no-confidence motion is approved by the Diet, Hata must 
either have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower 
house for a general election. 
  LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori, speaking at the party's 
headquarters Friday, said the budget is likely to be approved in 
the latter half of next week and the political situation will be 
"busy" thereafter. 
  Some powerful LDP figures, including former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe and former Transport Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, 
have insisted that "conservative" forces in the LDP should ally 
with those in the coalition government rather than seek 
cooperation with the SDP. 
  Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also reiterated at a 
press conference in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, on Friday that the LDP 
should not immediately propose a no-confidence motion. 
  However, the party made the decision to submit a 
no-confidence motion because it became more convinced that the 
SDP would cooperate, LDP sources said. 
  On Thursday, the LDP and the SDP cooperated to force a 
motion 
through the lower house budget panel summoning Hosokawa to 
testify next Tuesday under oath about his questionable personal 
finances, over which he was forced to resign in April. 
  Meanwhile, Yuichi Ichikawa, a major coalition government 
strategist, said Friday he will urge the SDP next week to come 
back into the ruling camp. 
  Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, a Buddhist-backed 
party in the ruling coalition, told reporters in Makubetsu, 
Hokkaido, that he wants to represent the ruling parties and meet 
SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo as early as the middle of next 
week to "exchange opinions frankly." 
  The SDP seceded from the coalition in April shortly after 
other ruling parties formed a lower house parliamentary group, 
"Kaishin," without consulting with the SDP. 
  Sakigake leader Takemura met some LDP members Friday and 
expressed a positive view on alliance with the LDP, political 
sources said. Takemura has also been eager to cooperate with 
the SDP, they said. 
  A high-ranking SDP official said Friday Hata's cabinet must 
resign en masse before the SDP will return to the ruling camp. 
  The official suggested the party may allow Hata to be prime 
minister again once a new cabinet is formed after his 
resignation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The ruling and opposition 
parties intensified their confrontation over the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee's decision Thursday [16 June] 
to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over his 
financial dealings. 
  The opposition parties forced a motion through the lower 
house budget panel to summon Hosokawa on June 21 to testify 
under oath about his questionable personal finances. The ruling 
parties committee members shouted "opposition," but they failed 
to override Budget Committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi's 
declaration that his panel summon the former premier. The 
opposition demanded that Hosokawa be summoned as his former 
secretary Masatoshi Miyama's testimony Wednesday was not enough 
to clarify his allegedly dubious money transactions. 
  In April Hosokawa gave up the premiership of the first 
coalition government in almost four decades when the opposition 
delayed Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget, demanding 
clarification of his financial affairs. 
  The ruling parties, upset by the committee's decision to 
summon Hosokawa, appealed to lower house speaker Takako Doi to 
brand the decision a result of "improper" procedures and nullify 
it. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which 
was forced out of power last August by Hosokawa's coalition 
government, is now assessing the timing of submitting a 
no-confidence motion against the minority government led by 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, political sources said. Hata, when 
asked about the decision to summon his predecessor, declined to 
comment, only saying "it is painful." 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic 
Party of Japan], the No. 2 opposition party which in April left 
the coalition, also aims at taking advantage of Hosokawa's 
plight to bring down the Hata cabinet. The opposition said that 
what Miyama told the panel Wednesday was not consistent with 
Hosokawa's earlier explanation about a 100 million yen loan from 
the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm in 1982. 
  Hosokawa insists he repaid the money by 1991 and that he had 
not known the interest arising from the loan was used as a 
political donation until two days before he announced his 
resignation in April. But Miyama told the panel he has informed 
Hosokawa's office that he handled the interest as a political 
donation at the end of 1993. 
  The opposition suspect Hosokawa might have used the entire 
100 million yen as illegal political donations. Several months 
after he received the money, in February 1983, Hosokawa ran 
successfully for election as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, 
southwestern Japan. 
  Hosokawa is also suspected of having been directly involved 
in purchasing several profitable stocks of Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone (NTT) Corp. in 1986. Although Hosokawa denies direct 
involvement in the deal, Miyama testified that the former 
premier has instructed him to help Hosokawa's father-in-law buy 
some NTT shares. Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu reportedly 
told former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, who heads the LDP's 
intraparty Political Reform Group, that he would support the 
submission if Hosokawa's summoning could be settled in a way 
easily understood by the public.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- A draft report on tax 
reforms worked out Thursday [16 June] by a tax panel of the 
ruling coalition called for phasing out tax privileges for small 
businesses, coalition officials said. 
  The report, to be presented to a meeting of coalition 
leaders 
early next week, did not propose a specific margin of raise for 
the consumption tax from the present 3 percent, leaving the 
decision up to the leaders. The coalition's tax reform package 
is expected to center on continued cuts in income and 
residential taxes after fiscal 1994 and a raise in the 
consumption tax. 
  Concerning a phaseout of tax privileges for small 
businesses, 
the report said the maximum annual sales of businesses that are 
allowed to keep the consumption tax they have collected from 
consumers should be cut to 20 million yen from the present 30 
million yen. It also called for abolition of the present system 
of allowing businesses with annual sales of less than 50 million 
yen to keep some of the consumption tax income. 
  In addition, the report said the maximum annual sales for 
businesses to which a simplified tax computation formula is 
applicable should be cut to either 300 million yen or 200 
million yen from the present 400 million yen. That decision is 
expected to be made by the tax panel in a meeting Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A draft report on tax 
reforms released Friday [17 June] by the government's tax 
commission calls for the shelving of part of a proposal that 
would reduce tax privileges for small businesses. 
  The report said a plan to lower the maximum annual sales, 
below which businesses are allowed to keep the consumption tax 
they have collected from consumers, from the present 30 million 
yen, should be shelved. 
  The report was released at a general meeting of the 
commission. 
  The commission is expected to present a report on a set of 
tax reform recommendations, focusing on income tax cuts and a 
raise in the consumption tax from the present 3 percent, to 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on June 22. 
  The draft report also said the maximum annual sales for 
businesses to which a simplified tax computation formula is 
applicable should be cut from the present 400 million yen but 
did not propose a margin for reduction. 
  It also called for a revision of the present system of 
allowing businesses with annual sales of less than 50 million 
yen to keep some of the consumption tax income. 
  The report did not propose a specific margin of increase for 
the consumption tax but did say tax burdens for Japanese will 
grow from increased fiscal demand for welfare measures. 
  It also said the combined maximum tax rate for income and 
residential taxes should be cut to 50 percent from the present 
65 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Newly elected Keidanren 
chief Shoichiro Toyoda said Thursday [16 June] deregulation is 
the single most important task for the country's most powerful 
business lobby. Toyoda, who was appointed chairman of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations on May 27, said it is the 
"mandate of our day" to pursue dramatic reforms of the 
political, bureaucratic and economic systems of the country. 
  Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan in his 
first public address as the head of Keidanren, Toyoda said 
deregulation is essential for Japan to create a more vigorous 
economy and gain international credibility. He promised that 
Keidanren under his reign will "think boldly and act steadily" 
to harmonize Japan's much-criticized social system into one that 
resembles those of other major countries. 
  Asked how Keidanren will have its schemes for social 
revolution realized, Toyoda, who is also chairman of Toyota 
Motor Corp., said the organization will do so through constant 
consultation with the government. He said clearly Keidanren 
will not wield its influence on policy-makers by funneling 
corporate donations to politicians as before. 
  Responding to a question about concerns that deregulation 
would lead to a higher jobless rate, he said he hopes the 
possibility can be avoided by creating jobs through the 
innovation of new technologies and industries. 
  He was cautious on the state of the economy, which some 
observers claim has turned a corner. "There are some quarters 
in the economy which are showing bright signs, but such unstable 
factors as the political fragility and the high yen have kept me 
from saying for sure that the economy has been improving," he 
said. 
  Calling for tax cuts and increased investments -- 100 
trillion yen more than the planned 430 trillion yen for the 
current decade -- in public works projects, Toyoda said a hike 
in indirect taxes such as the consumption tax is inevitable in 
order for the plans to take shape. He failed, however, to 
specify how far the now 3 percent consumption tax rate should be 
hiked.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will 
allow nonlife insurance companies to issue domestic convertible 
bonds (CBs) for the first time in almost five years in line with 
deregulation in the financial sector, ministry sources said 
Thursday [16 June]. The move will be welcomed by nonlife 
insurance companies that are gaining interest in procuring 
funds. A convertible bond is a bond that can be converted into 
the shares of a company at a fixed price. 
  Koa Fire and Marine Insurance Co. is seen issuing 30 billion 
yen in CBs as early as July, while Yasuda Fire and Marine 
Insurance Co., and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. are 
predicted to follow suit. 
  The ministry has so far restricted the issuance of CBs to 
prevent nonlife insurance firms from easily raising funds and 
making investments, the sources said. The CB market has been 
weak since the burst of the "bubble economy," but it is now 
showing signs of improvement. Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance 
Co. was the last nonlife insurance firm to issue CBs, in July 
1989.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry should hike the limit on its life 
insurance policies to allow for more medical care and welfare 
for Japan's aging population, an advisory group to the ministry 
said in a report Thursday [16 June]. The midterm report was 
drawn up by a private group commissioned by the head of the 
ministry's Post Office Life Insurance Bureau. 
  Noting that the current limit of 10 million yen for life 
insurance policyholders is not enough for high-quality coverage, 
the report urged the ministry to allow more expensive policies 
and pointed to a need for the contents of coverage to be 
improved. The report also urged active marketing of 
high-quality policies in the area outside of life and standard 
nonlife insurance. 
  The sector, which includes cancer and nursing care coverage, 
is dominated by foreign companies and the United States is 
requesting the sector's liberalization to be put on hold.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata 
on Thursday [16 June] requested the power industry to continue 
the temporary rate cut beyond September. 
  Hata made the request, the first of its kind to be done 
formally, during a breakfast meeting with power industry 
leaders, including Kohei Abe, head of the Federation of Electric 
Power Companies. 
  Hata said the power industry should reflect "anticipation of 
the Japanese people" in its rate policy. 
  Abe said the industry will decide whether or not to extend 
the rate cut by considering economic conditions like crude oil 
prices. 
  In November 1993, power and gas utilities implemented a 
temporary cut in their rates, valid until Sept. 30, to pass on 
to consumers the benefits of the yen's appreciation against the 
dollar. 
  On construction of nuclear power plants, Abe, president of 
Chubu Electric Power Co., said the industry will give priority 
to safety and environmental protection in selecting new 
locations. 
  Large-lot industrial power demand is still slack amid the 
overall economic slump, Abe said. 
  But he added power demand will turn up in a long-term, 
increasing the importance of nuclear power plants.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan's production of 
plastic resins in May increased from a year earlier for all four 
types of product, the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association 
said Thursday [16 June]. It was the first time in two and a 
half years that production marked year-on-year gains for all the 
four types. 
  Industry analysts said the increased output signals a 
recovery for the slumping petrochemical industry, but the 
association said demand for plastic resins is unlikely to make a 
full recovery soon. 
  Production of low-density polyethylene was up 6.0 percent, 
high- density polyethylene up 8.0 percent, polypropylene up 3.0 
percent and polystyrene up 6.0 percent, the association said. 
Production of polystyrene, used in household appliances, hit a 
monthly record of 112,700 tons.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Pretax profits of 95 firms 
listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) market climbed 16.2 percent 
in fiscal 1993 over a year earlier for the first rise in three 
years, a private think tank reported Friday [17 June]. 
  The Daiwa Institute of Research, affiliated with Daiwa 
Securities Co., predicted a 15.8 percent rise in the same firms' 
profits for the current fiscal year ending next March 31. 
  The think tank said the effects of restructuring measures 
will be quickly reflected in their business results because 
corporations listed on the OTC market are relatively small in 
scale. 
  The listed firms also consist mainly of processing and 
service industry firms, whose recovery was quicker than that of 
the materials, construction and electric companies which are 
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
  The institute said improvement of their financial balances 
also contributed to profit growth. 
  The combined deficit in their financial balances dropped 
19.3 
percent to 33.8 billion yen in fiscal 1993. 
  It said the OTC firms moved to raise funds through new stock 
issues and convertible bonds by decreasing borrowings from banks.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The government plans to 
review its long-term supply-demand projection for rice and other 
key agricultural products to prepare for drastic changes in 
agriculture under a new global trade accord, officials said 
Thursday [16 June]. 
  The current projection, approved by the cabinet in January 
1990, calls for a food self-sufficiency rate of 50 percent in 
the year 2000. But Japan's decision to end its decades-old ban 
on rice imports last December in order to sign the Uruguay round 
trade agreement has altered conditions on which the latest 
projection was made. The agreement calls for converting 
nontariff trade barriers such as import bans into tariffs but 
allows Japan to have a six-year grace period before doing so on 
condition that it imports 4 to 8 percent of its domestic rice 
consumption during the period. 
  Japan is to negotiate what to do over its rice market 
opening 
after the moratorium, making it uncertain what the domestic rice 
supply-demand will be after the year 2000. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is 
studying several options in projecting the supply-demand 
situation for rice and other key agricultural products after 
that year, ministry officials said. They include one case in 
which Japan will replace all import bans and quotas with 
tariffs, and another in which the grace period will be extended, 
they said. 
  To date, the ministry has reviewed its long-term 
supply-demand projection for rice and other key farm products 
every 10 years to set a guideline on domestic agricultural 
production.

-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Beijing 16 June 1994 
  Beloved compatriots: I have the honor to pay my great, most 
affectionate respects to the two supreme patriarchs and all 
venerable monks and to all my beloved compatriots. I would like 
to inform you of the following news: 
  Following thorough and exhaustive examinations, my very 
competent Chinese doctors were of the opinion that for me to be 
completely cured, I must undergo three or four additional 
sessions of anticancer chemotherary at the end of June, which 
will require me to stay in the PRC for another three or four 
months. 
  Although I have to live far away from you, venerable monks 
and beloved compatriots, all my heart and my thoughts will 
remain forever close to our revered motherland. Every morning, 
I make my prayer and pay my deference to the august image of our 
great guru, begging that full peace will return to all of 
Cambodia so that my beloved compatriots can once again live in 
happiness and enjoy prosperity as in the times of Sangkum Reas 
Niyum before the 18 March 1970 coup d'etat. 
  I wish the two supreme patriarches, all Buddhist monks, and 
all compatriots the five Buddhist blessings, that is, long life, 
social prestige, happiness, good health, and enlightment. 
  [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the Korean Roman Catholic Association in a statement June 16 
strongly urged the Japanese Government that the authorities stop 
suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) at once and severely punish those involved in 
it. 
  The Japanese authorities' recent fascist outrage against the 
Kyoto prefectural organization of Chongnyon following their open 
crackdown on its Osaka prefectural organizations is an 
unpardonable, heinous act of political suppression, the 
statement said. 
  It warned that if the Japanese authorities persist in their 
suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan by availing 
themselves of the international reactionaries' campaign for 
stifling the DPRK, they would be held entirely responsible for 
all the irretrievable consequences arising therefrom.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The first phase of 
sanctions proposed by the United States against North Korea over 
its nuclear recalcitrance is unlikely to have much effect on 
Japan, well-placed sources predicted Thursday [16 June]. 
  Japan has indicated that it supports in principle 
Washington's draft resolution to be submitted to the UN Security 
Council in response to North Korea's refusal to permit 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
  The sources pointed out, however, that the first phase of 
sanctions, including bans on arms trade and development 
assistance, would have only a minimal effect on Japan. The 
first phase of proposed sanctions, still subject to change, 
includes a ban on nonpassenger flights into North Korea, an 
embargo on technical and scientific cooperation, and 
participation in sports events, cultural, scientific, 
educational and diplomatic exchanges. Local governments 
bordering on the Sea of Japan which currently have exchanges 
with North Korea may be asked to exercise restraint in their 
relations if sanctions are adopted, the sources said. 
  With the absence of diplomatic relations between Tokyo and 
Pyongyang, bilateral cultural exchanges have been limited to 100 
or so North Koreans coming to Japan annually. A Justice 
Ministry survey reveals that some 16,000 North Koreans entered 
Japan in 1992, but 90 percent of these North Korean nationals 
were residents of Japan returning from a trip overseas. Only 
756 of the North Koreans coming to Japan entered the country as 
business-related people or tourists with 51 entering the country 
on cultural or sports exchanges. 
  The second phase of sanctions would more closely affect 
Japan 
since it would be asked to close down the flow of billions of 
yen in hard currency in support that Korean residents of Japan 
send to their relatives in North Korea. North Korea has warned 
that any sanctions imposed by the United Nations would be 
considered a declaration of war and has said Japan would not be 
able to evade its "deserved punishment."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The issue of whether to 
impose economic sanctions on North Korea has reached a 
"delicate" stage with recent new developments, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [17 June]. 
  He said the U.S.-proposed halting of remittances to North 
Korea would be effective, with other nations expected to 
cooperate if the United Nations decides to adopt such a 
resolution. 
  The United States has proposed a two-staged sanction plan 
against North Korea over its refusal to allow full international 
nuclear inspections. The halting of remittances is included in 
the second stage. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. is making last-ditch efforts to solve 
the issue through negotiations with former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter, who is now visiting Pyongyang. 
  "I must refrain from commenting because the North Korean 
issue is delicate with new developments in the making," said 
Fujii in an apparent reference to Carter's visit. 
  He noted that the Foreign Ministry is now tackling the issue 
and his ministry has not received any "details" over the 
U.S.-proposed sanctions. 
  Turning to the domestic issue, Fujii said the recent rises 
in 
long-term market rates reflected "market perception over the 
global trend and slight brightness in Japan's economy." 
  But he refused to comment directly on the interest rate 
directions, unlike Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno who said 
in his press remarks Wednesday that long-term rates would settle 
at levels reflecting the economic state in the longer run.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Friday [17 June] confirmed progress in working out 
qualitative criteria in telecommunications trade talks but did 
not discuss in depth the thorniest issue of setting quantitative 
yardsticks, officials said. 
  "In a cordial and positive atmosphere, there was a 
considerable progress to narrow difference on qualitative 
criteria," a U.S. trade official said, briefing reporters on two 
days of working-level talks on ways to enhance American access 
to the Japanese telecommunications market. 
  Telecom trade, covered under government procurement along 
with medical equipment, is one of three priority fields under 
the bilateral trade "Framework" negotiations launched in July 
last year. 
  A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said U.S. 
understanding 
has been deepened on a set of measures to open the Japanese 
telecom market, which were contained in a market-opening package 
released in March. 
  The U.S. official, who requested anonymity, said the talks 
focused on procedural problems and that the quantitative aspect 
of "objective criteria" as a tool to assess openness of the 
Japanese telecom market will be put on hold until higher-level 
talks expected in Tokyo next week. 
  But the official said that a specific time schedule for a 
meeting between Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi 
and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has yet 
to be fixed. 
  The expected subcabinet-level meeting will be shortly 
followed by further working-level negotiations, the official 
said. 
  The Japanese spokesman acknowledged that differences remain 
between the two parties over the Japanese-proposed "overall 
evaluation method" for selecting winners in tenders for 
government-sponsored projects. 
  The method, proposed in the March market-opening package, is 
designed to evaluate not only bid prices but product 
performances and functions. 
  "U.S. concerns are evident when looking at a number of 
exceptions and discretions attached," the U.S. trade official 
said. 
  The Japanese spokesman said, "It would not be correct to say 
Washington has given Japan 120 points on the latest evaluation 
proposal." 
  On another sticking point of whether or not Nippon Telegraph 
and Telephone Corp. (NTT) should be covered by government 
procurement talks, the U.S. official said, "The two sides have 
not been able to narrow differences on the area." 
  The U.S. official reiterated Washington's preparedness to 
review Japan's government procurement practices by the end of 
June in line with the 1988 bilateral agreement on government 
procurement. 
  "June 30 is one of a series of important dates for 
Japan-U.S. 
trade ties," the official said, quoting the recent remark by 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Provoker's Unreasonable </F>
Faultfinding"] 
  [Text] Today the world' public opinion highly appraises 
our decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] as a just self-defense measure and as a courageous 
decision that only the DPRK can make. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are arguing with us, 
taking a displeased attitude toward our decision. In other 
words, in a meeting with former U.S. President Carter on 14 
June, traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our withdrawal from the 
IAEA is an abnormal act, a challenge to the demands of the 
international community, and the like and babbled again about 
the inevitability of UN sanctions against the North. This is 
indeed a provoker's unreasonable faultfinding. 
  Although the puppets are clamoring about an abnormal act, a 
challenge, and the like, as a matter of fact, it is precisely 
the agency's Secretariat, which has followed the U.S. 
imperialists' plot to crush our Republic, who thrust us out of 
the agency. 
  As is known, since we joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] and concluded a safeguards agreement, we have 
sincerely received inspections pursuant to it. However, giving 
up its mission and function as an international organization, 
the agency's Secretariat adopted a resolution regarding a 
special inspection of our military facilities by intentionally 
fabricating inconsistence [uidojoguro purilchirul manduro naeso]. 
  Even after we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the 
declared withdrawal from the NPT, in an effort for a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue, the agency's Secretariat forced 
us to accept inspections equivalent to regular and nonregular 
inspections, not inspections to guarantee the continuity of 
safeguards. Hurriedly jumping at the distorted conclusion that 
it has become impossible to measure the fuel rods taken this 
time from the experimental reactor, the agency's Secretariat 
went so far as to adopt an unreasonable resolution of suspending 
the agency's coordination while demanding a special inspection 
of our military facilities. The agency Secretariat's arrogant 
and insolent maneuvers can be seen in this fact alone. 
  Thus, as we received the agency's inspections and as we 
showed sincerity and generosity, some quarters of the agency's 
Secretariat further intensified its pressure upon us, thereby 
escalating its maneuvers of crushing the Republic. 
  Under such circumstances, how can our Republic, which 
regards 
independence as its life, tolerate the agency's unwarranted 
acts? How can it idly look at the nation's dignity and 
sovereignty being trampled underfoot? 
  As clearly indicated in the statement, our withdrawal from 
the IAEA is because the agency perpetrated an act of gravely 
infringing upon our Republic's dignity and sovereignty. 
  Fair public opinion of the world says that the 
responsibility 
for North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA lies in this agency 
itself. Our decision taken this time is a just self-defending 
measure to defend our dignity and sovereignty. The 
responsibility for our withdrawal from the IAEA lies also in the 
South Korean puppets. The puppets, who have been frantic in 
crushing us in collusion with the United States and some 
quarters of the IAEA Secretariat, are presumptuously talking 
about abnormal, challenge, and the like. This is indeed a 
shameless act. 
  With no sophistry can the puppets escape their criminal 
responsibility for having driven the situation to this point. 
  At a press conference on 14 June, the puppets clamored that 
if the North fails to change its attitude the UN Security 
Council will take a stern measure. This reveals once again their 
insidious attempt to isolate and crush us. 
  UN sanctions are synonymous with a declaration of war 
against 
us. Therefore, the puppets' clamoring about the inevitability of 
UN sanctions is nothing but preaching of the inevitability of a 
declaration of war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is a ring of intolerable national 
traitors who are not interested in national destiny and who stop 
at nothing to do harm to fellow countrymen. The Kim Yong-sam 
ring will not go unpunished. If the Kim Yong-sam ring thinks 
that it can survive by doing harm to fellow countrymen, this is 
a foolish delusion. The puppets should not run wild like a mad 
dog.

<F P=106> ["`Nuclear Strategy' Directed Against Developing Countries" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a signed article on the further intensifying military 
threat of the imperialists and their followers against the DPRK 
and some developing countries under the pretext of 
"non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles". 
  The article says: 
  The United States is stepping up its military offensive 
against the developing countries more feverishly than before 
under the pretext of "nuclear non-proliferation". This tells 
that the United States' global strategy, nuclear strategy is 
being focussed on the developing countries. 
  One of the new "modes of fighting" of the United States at 
present is the "nuclear non-proliferation strategy". This 
"strategy" means that the United States will counter a "threat" 
from the "proliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles" of the 
developing countries with newly developed weapons. 
  To this end, the United States granted the U.S. President 
and 
commanders of U.S. forces greater powers to use nuclear weapons, 
and is actively developing micro-nukes of new generation and 
detecting devices. 
  The ulterior aim sought by it through the "nuclear non- 
proliferation strategy" is to prevent the developing countries 
from possessing or making nuclear weapons under the pretext of 
"nuclear non-proliferation" and thereby maintain its position as 
a nuclear power and intensify interference and domination over 
them. 
  In a word, this "strategy" is to establish a "new world 
order" in which the United States has the field to itself 
dominating the developing countries with a nuclear whip. 
  Today the sharp edge of attack of this "strategy" is 
directed 
at the DPRK. The United States is scheming to dispatch, in case 
of "contingency" on the Korean peninsula, reinforcements of 
600,000 troops, more than 200 warships, over 1,600 aircraft and 
even its forces deployed in Germany and Alaska. And, when 
unleashing another war in Korea, it is trying to inveigle Japan 
and other international reactionaries in it. 
  But the United States cannot bring us to our knees with 
strength. 
  The Korean people are determined and prepared to counter any 
military option of the United States. The United States must 
give up its new adventurous strategy.

  [Text] A news conference was held at our country's embassy 
in Moscow on 15 June regarding our country's Foreign Ministry 
statement dated 13 June on our withdrawal from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Reporters from Russian papers and 
news agencies attended the news conference. 
  Our country's ambassador Son Song-pil answered reporters' 
questions. He explained in detail the background of our 
country's Foreign Ministry statement and pointed out: A 
spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry issued a statement 
taking stern measures against the IAEA's unjust maneuvers of 
imposing sanctions against our country and its attempt to 
intrude into our country's military sites. 
  The action taken by our country is a due measure against the 
IAEA's unjust maneuvers. The IAEA Board of Governors meeting, 
following the U.S. policy of crushing the DPRK, adopted a 
resolution on suspending the agency's assistance to our country 
and demanded the opening of our military sites. This is 
obviously the agency's sanctions against us and, in essence, a 
prelude to UN sanctions. 
  Saying that we have made every possible effort regarding the 
core refueling operation, the envoy continued that the United 
States and the IAEA are, however, making a stir to impose 
sanctions and said: The IAEA sanctions are an intolerable 
humiliation to our people. Our people cannot negotiate with 
someone that infringes upon our nation's sovereignty and 
dignity. The more sanctions or pressures that are imposed on 
us, the stronger our volition will become and the freer our 
peaceful nuclear activities will become The stronger the 
pressure becomes, the more our people will sternly deal with it. 
It is our principled stance to respond to dialogue with dialogue 
and war with war. Sanctions and dialogue are incompatible. It 
is absurd that they insist on having dialogue while imposing 
pressure and sanctions. 
  He then answered the reporters' questions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The National Council of 
Christian Churches of South Korea released a statement Wednesday 
denouncing the U.S. imperialists for heightening the situation 
with each passing day, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  In the statement published in the name of the reunification 
committee it said the recent tension on the Korean peninsula is 
attributable to the wrong international order orchestrated by a 
nuclear power. The "nuclear issue" should be solved through 
dialogue, not by means of pressure or "sanctions", it stressed. 
  The statement urged that "the United States should give up 
its dream of settling the North's `nuclear issue' through 
sanctions and war." 
  It also urged the "government" authorities to make sincere 
efforts for reconciliation and unity, understanding that those 
in the North are fellow countrymen with the same blood and 
brothers who should work together to build a reunified country.

13 universities including Yonsei and Korea Universities in Seoul 
staged a demonstration Wednesday demanding a stop to the 
"civilian defence training," according to a radio report from

  In a literature they said that "the `government' is now 
trying to avoid the failure of its anti-popular policy by means 
of increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula through a massive 
anti-communist campaign." They branded the "training" as "one 
defining fellow countrymen as the enemy" and strongly demanded 
its stop. 
  On the 14th, 50 odd young people threw some 40 paint bottles 
at a police booth near Kyongpuk National University in Taegu and 
vanished after destroying its furniture.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The editorial board of 
the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation got through 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) the 
political treatise "The Future of the Nation Viewed From 
Anecdote of Pyongyang" authored by Kim Son-pil, a professor of 
political science at a university in Seoul, and broadcast it on 
June 12. 
  He recalled that his friend told him that when a member of 
the Seoul delegation to the Red Cross talks in Pyongyang, 20 odd 
years ago, asked a girl who looked to be around 15 years old how 
much the foundation stones of the statue of President Kim 
Il-song erected on Mansu Hill weigh, he said "the weight of the 
foundation stones of our father Marshal Kim Il-song's statue is 
the same as the total weight of the hearts of the 50 million 
people in the North and the South." 
  He wrote that what she said reflected the whole of the 
North, 
represented the mentality of its people and showed the true 
appearance of its society and the great potentials of its system. 
  Noting that what the people think about the statue of their 
leader and its foundation stones is a symbol of the 
singlehearted unity peculiar to the North, he said: 
  According to my knowledge gained through various channels, 
the North is the only country in the world that has actualized 
the political administration based on the unity of the people. 
In the North the intention of the leader is precisely the 
intention of the people and what the people think is what the 
leader thinks. The people say as intended by the leader and the 
latter shapes politics as desired by the former. 
  The leader's politics is, so to speak, the aspiration and 
will of the people. The leader takes care of the destiny of the 
people and shapes good policies for the people and the people 
remain faithful to the leader, entrusting their destiny to him. 
The secret of the North's singlehearted unity lies in that all 
the people have become one in everything. 
  When a journalist who came to Pyongyang from Seoul to cover 
the North-South dialogue in the 1970s asked an old woman how 
many members Premier Kim Il-song' family had, he answered "the 
members of our premier's family number 50 million." When the 
North-South dialogue was being held in the 1990's, a journalist 
from Seoul asked an old man where the Chong-il peak was. He 
answered: "Chong-il peak is in Mt. Paektu. The Koreans must 
know of Mt. Paektu and Chong-il peak." 
  The remarks of the old man are interpreted as meaning that 
the Koreans must know of the greatness and extraordinariness of 
supreme commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Chong-il. 
  In Western countries, supreme commander Kim Chong-il is 
praised as the greatest hero in the world who has become a 
bright light in the east predicted by Indian poet Tagor to 
illumine the universe, and created an oasis in the world as dry 
as a desert due to the lack of the leadership ability of 
statesmen in the present times. 
  The loyal heart of the people in the North in upholding and 
following the leader has become all the warmer while years 
passed by from the 70s to the 90s, and it has grown in eight now 
when the numbers of the nation have grown to 70 million than in 
the period when they totalled 50 million. 
  Such a singlehearted unity is unimaginable in the South. 
  It is a foolish dream to hope for a harmony of the people in 
the South where there is not a great man. 
  The anecdote of Pyongyang also tells that only a great man 
enjoys the loyalty of the people. 
  In Pyongyang blessed with two great men there is a 
philosophy 
and politics for the nation. The North has an ideological 
wealth for living its way and by itself. It is the political 
spirit peculiar to the North in the limelight of the planet to 
shape independent politics, neither depending on outside forces 
nor bowing to the pressure of foreign forces nor wavering in the 
western or eastern wind in the world where the big-power-first 
logic is forced. 
  In my opinion, the political philosophy and political spirit 
of the North have been so strong and steadfast that they are 
lauded by all the people. The North is now overcoming 
single-handed the pressure and blackmail of the United States 
and its Western allies not to be reduced again to other's slave 
and not to be subject to others. This spirit of the North looks 
far greater than that of the Koyro dynasty, a powerful country 
which lasted a thousand tears. 
  The singlehearted unity of the North is the greatest wealth 
of the nation. Such a unity in which all the people are united 
with the same purpose and obligation and harmonized with each 
other on the basis of virtues is a product of the extraordinary 
leadership of secretary Kim Chong-il. With this unity, the 
North, being a half of a divided small country, demonstrates the 
might of its political force, making dignified remarks to 
Western powers when it feels it necessary to do so, and keeping 
silence like a rock when it should do so. Such prestige and 
power of the nation which had never been seen in its history 
spanning [word indistinct] years are feats performed by 
secretary Kim Chong-il. 
  The leader being great, the history of the nation has been 
correctly established, the society enjoys abundance and the 
people have become beautiful in the North. 
  What is most difficult in the world is to make the people 
beautiful, I dare say. It is not difficult to make a [word 
indistinct] or build an industrial complex. But all sorts of 
hard works or a bible or a doctrine are not enough for making 
the people true human beings. 
  The North is the only earthly paradise on the globe which 
has 
resolved this human-historic task. 
  Noting that the human-historic question where lies the 
future 
of the nation has already been answered by the Pyongyang 
anecdote,the author of the treatise says: 
  It is the irresistible trend of the time that the people's 
mind tends toward the true leader of the nation. 
  The author concludes: 
  Public-minded South Korean people, though they are in the 
South, have their mind in the North. The mind tending towards 
the North -- this is the trend among the South Korean people who 
see through the future of the nation. 
  The political art of President Kim Il-song in his eighties 
and secretary Kim Chong-il in his fifties are combined together 
to strike the world with admiration. 
  Think that this is a light illumining the future of the 
nation. 
  Therefore, the foundation stones of the statue of President 
Kim Il-song on Mansu hill in Pyongyang weigh as much as the 
hearts of the 70 million fellow countrymen who follow the two 
great men, the hearts of all the people who believe in them as 
in heaven. In other words it is the weight of the universe. 
  The future of the nation lies in the North.

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshikazu Imari, member of TOKYO SHIMBUN's </F>
General Affairs Bureau in the United States; first in a series 
entitled: "Structure of North Korea's Suspected Development of 
Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the International Community": 
"U.S. Expectations; Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a 
Proposition; Deep-Rooted Apprehension About Japan Still Exists"] 
  [Text] The Clinton administration has been patient and 
making utmost diplomatic efforts in dealing with the DPRK (North 
Korea) over its suspected nuclear arms development. As former 
President Carter was about to leave for Pyongyang, North Korea 
announced on 13 June its secession from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The United States is struggling to prevent North Korea's 
nuclear arms development project because it thinks that, if 
North Korea is allowed "to have its way," nuclear states will 
emerge one after another, nuclear weapons will proliferate in 
the world, the system of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) and IAEA will collapse, and North Korea's nuclear project 
will become a serious threat to world peace. 
  In addition to the United States, Russia, Britain, and 
France, which own nuclear weapons, South Africa disclosed its 
temporary ownership of nuclear weapons. Also, there is a strong 
suspicion that such countries as India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, 
and Libya either own already or are currently developing nuclear 
arms. We still remember the news report on the IAEA's nuclear 
inspections of Iraq. We cannot completely rule out the 
possibility that North Korea's "nuclear" issue may become an 
incentive to the ROK and other Southeast Asian nations to move 
toward becoming nuclear nations. 
  There is a deep-rooted concern in the United States in 
particular, that Japan, which is well capable of developing 
nuclear weapons, will acquire nuclear weapons in the future. 
Japan has been stressing its peace Constitution and three 
nonnuclear principles. However, U.S. Congressman John Kasich 
said: "Sometimes, politicians change their fundamental demands. 
It is impossible to predict how politicians will act when they 
feel that their countrymen are exposed to a danger." 
  North Korea's nuclear arms development plan is directly 
linked to a denial of the diplomacy of the Clinton 
administration, which calls for "post-Cold War changes." The 
U.S. Government analyzes that North Korea already has one or two 
"nuclear weapons," which are either completed or still under 
construction. The United States also predicts that North Korea 
will be able to extract enough plutonium to make four or five 
bombs from spent fuel rods, which were recently removed from a 
reactor, and that a new reactor, which will be constructed as 
early as next year, will produce enough plutonium to produce 
from 10 to 12 bombs annually. The United States just cannot 
leave the North Korean plan to take its own course. 
  The U.S. Government has been patient and trying to settle 
the 
issue through dialogue with North Korea because tension will 
build up on the Korean peninsula and even a military collision 
cannot be avoided should hard-line measures be taken. If that 
happens, the U.S. forces in the ROK will be the first to suffer 
major casualties. Also, there is a fear of radiation pollution 
if North Korean nuclear facilities are destroyed. 
  The Congress and the public are keeping a strict watch on 
the 
Clinton administration. At a meeting of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Asia-Pacific affairs, 
Chairman Gary Ackerman addressed severe questions to the State 
Department. 
  He said: "It was (the diplomatic policy of the past) that if 
somebody told you at gun point to "give me your wallet," you 
would say "no unless you show me if the gun is loaded." Even if 
you demand North Korea, before sitting at a negotiation table, 
to give up all cards it has, I do not think it will listen." 
  The Cable News Network's recent survey over the telephone 
shows that 80 percent of the American people, or an overwhelming 
majority, said yes to the question of whether "the United States 
should impose economic sanctions against North Korea." Only 13 
percent of the respondents were against it and 7 percent said 
they did not know. 
  Moreover, in response to a question on whether if "military 
action should be taken to destroy North Korea's nuclear 
facilities," 46 percent of the respondents said yes and 40 
percent said no. 
  However, China, which is supplying oil and food to North 
Korea, still has not said that it will cooperate with the United 
Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea. Although 
Japan stresses officially that it will act in harmony with the 
United Nations, it is not actively supporting the idea of 
banning remittances to North Korea. The Clinton 
administration's irritation and confusion continue.

  [Text] Kozo Watanabe, head of the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] delegation which has just returned from a visit 
to the DPRK (North Korea), held a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club in Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo, on 16 June. With 
regard to the issue of North Korea's development of nuclear 
arms, Watanabe said, "This should still be resolved through 
dialogue; I am opposed to sanctions." The Japanese Government 
has informed the United States of its support of the draft UN 
Security Council resolution proposing five forms of sanctions, 
including arms embargo. His position directly contradicts 
government policy. 
  Watanabe further pointed out the need to: 1) ask Japan and 
other countries concerned to bring about an early reopening of 
talks between the United States and North Korea; 2) resume the 
Japan-DPRK normalization talks unconditionally; and 3) prepare 
for visits of North Korean VIP's to Japan to promote exchanges 
between various sectors of Japan and North Korea in order to 
create correct public opinion in Japan.

  [Text] The government appraises positively the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] resolution on sanctions against the DPRK (North 
Korea) drafted by the United States because "it provides for a 
grace period to serve as a warning, and Japan's position has 
been taken into consideration to a certain extent," (according 
to a top Foreign Ministry official). If the resolution is 
adopted, Japan will promptly perform its duties as a UN member. 
  The government appreciates in particular the fact that the 
objective of the sanctions -- to make North Korea change its 
mind -- is clearly indicated. It believes that providing for a 
grace period of 30 days from the adoption of the resolution 
before sanctions are actually implemented is "a result of 
accommodating Japan's original proposal" on "step-by-step 
sanctions starting with a warning resolution," (according to a 
Foreign Ministry source). 
  Since the draft resolution is being considered at the UNSC, 
the focus is now on how China will react. The government says 
that "at this point, we have absolutely no indication how China 
will act," (according to a top Foreign Ministry official). It 
believes that although China's response may change the substance 
of the resolution, "it is improbable that the resolution will 
become any tougher." It would like to see the resolution passed 
in the end in a form conducive to encouraging North Korea to 
change its attitude through discussions in the UNSC involving 
China.

  [Text] Concerning the U.S.-proposed draft sanctions 
resolution of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to deal with the 
DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, a government 
official said: "Japan will be able to participate in the first 
phase of sanctions without amending current laws." He thus 
indicated the government is preparing for sanctions against 
North Korea. However, if the UNSC fails to adopt the resolution 
and if Japan, the United States, and South Korea should carry 
out sanctions independently, Japan will be placed in a difficult 
position over the issue of halting remittances to the DPRK, a 
measure included in the second phase of sanctions. 
  Commenting on the U.S.-proposed resolution, a Foreign 
Ministry official said on 16 June: "If the situation remains as 
it is, less rigid (sanctions measures) will be adopted. Severer 
measures are unlikely. Also, the United States will not call 
for independent sanctions." He also indicated that unless 
Pyongyang orders International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspectors to leave the country, or it begins procedures for its 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), 
sanctions will be moderate. 
  Even if the U.S.-proposed resolution is adopted, actual 
sanctions would be carried out after a one-month grace period. 
The sanctions would include a ban on arms export, and halting 
UN economic and development assistance. Concerning a ban on all 
air traffic except passenger flights, a Foreign Ministry source 
said: "Chartered flights might be affected by the ban. As for 
passenger flights, North Korea has not allowed them to fly into 
the country since May last year. Only cargo planes carrying 
matsutake mushrooms are allowed to stop by." 
  The second phase would include a freeze on sending 
remittances to North Korea. To implement this measure, it is 
necessary for Japan to revise the Foreign Exchange Law. Article 
16 of the law stipulates that Japan can suspend remittances "if 
it is necessary to faithfully fulfill the treaties and 
international agreements Japan concluded." But the Finance 
Ministry asserts that an agreement among only Japan, the United 
States, and the ROK does not provide sufficient reason for 
freezing remittances. It notes the need to have a UN 
resolution, saying: "If it is impossible to revise the law, the 
alternative to implement the freeze would be to have a UN 
resolution." 
  The Foreign Exchange Law sets the limit of the amount of yen 
to be carried by a traveler to North Korea at 5 million yen. 
The Foreign Ministry has said it is possible to drastically 
lower this limit, and to halt remittances to the DPRK through 
Japanese financial institutions with the issuance of a ministry 
notice. But without a UN resolution, people going to North 
Korea via third countries, which do not participate in 
sanctions, could thwart the special measure. Without a UN 
resolution, sanctions would be less effective. This is the 
reason why Japan is reluctant to stop remittances.

<F P=106> [(Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; third </F>
in a series entitled: "Japan and the United States -- the 
Picture Shakes": "The Invincible `Super NEC'"] 
  [Text]Keeping USTR in Check 
  "I'm giving each of you 10 minutes. Go ahead." Thus began 
Assistant to the President Rubin. It was a late February 
meeting of the United States National Economic Council (NEC). 
  United States Trade Representative (USTR) Kantor led off the 
discussion, emphasizing that bringing back Super Article 301 of 
the Omnibus U.S. Trade Law (for designating and applying 
sanctions against unfair trading countries and activities) was 
indispensable for pressing Japan for further market opening. 
Taking the opposite position was Chairman Tyson of the 
President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). She explained 
that bringing back the article would only invite a backlash from 
other countries and argued that its effect would be slight. 
  Following the animated discussion, President Clinton settled 
the issue. "Okay, I understand what you're saying. We'll bring 
back Super 301 after making it a little more flexible." 
  This is the NEC, which is now involved in nearly all 
important U.S. economic policies. The circumstances of the 
NEC's "bringing back Super 301 after four years" were obtained 
from the testimony of a number of individuals related to the 
U.S. Government. 
  Under the President, the council consists of approximately 
20 
individuals centering around Rubin and Deputy Assistant Cutter 
(NEC deputy chief). The council usually meets in the small, 
windowless Roosevelt Room in the White House's West Wing. The 
NEC consists of nearly the same members as the cabinet. The 
difference is that the council is composed of deputy chiefs from 
subordinate agencies. These subordinate agencies flesh out the 
strategic details. On the whole, the NEC has become a powerful 
policy management squad. 
  How much power does the NEC have in this administration? At 
a meeting of NEC deputy chiefs in mid-March, Deputy Assistant 
Stanley Roth, who had just transferred from the Department of 
Defense to the National Security Council (NSC)/NEC, questioned 
USTR Kantor: "I'd like you to think about how China and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) view 
Japan-U.S. confrontation. If relations between Japan and the 
United States become strained due to trade problems, it will 
only give China and others an opening. It wouldn't be in the 
U.S. interest at all." 
  Following the rupture in February in the bilateral summit, 
not one person raised the "standard of revolt" against the 
USTR's taking a hard line against Japan. But when Cutter and 
Deputy Assistant Berger (NSC deputy chief) aligned themselves 
with Roth's statement, the entire government made a great shift 
to a soft line against Japan. 
<H5>  U.S. Business Planning Board </H5>
  The NEC had originally been a proposal of Republican Senator 
William Roth, who knows Japan well, during the preceding Bush 
administration. The aim was "to bring together everything from 
macroeconomics to trade and technology policy to make economic 
policy consistent." In other words, the NEC was to be "the U.S. 
version of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI]." 
  President Clinton, although a Democrat, quickly latched onto 
the concept. Soon after assuming office, he set about 
establishing the NEC. 
  In late April, President Clinton gave a handwritten letter 
to 
Secretary of State Christopher for him to deliver on his trip to 
Saudi Arabia. The letter pressured King Fahd to place his order 
with the U.S. company AT&amp;T for the 4 billion dollar 
telecommunications upgrade the country was planning. 
  The NEC is said to have been deeply involved in this letter, 
too. The NEC is seen as participating in nearly all large-scale 
business negotiations, including Motorola's deal for a switching 
system for mobile telephones in Beijing and orders for Boeing 
aircraft. The accompanying contracts for U.S. corporations is 
thought to total some 10 billion dollars (1.1 trillion yen). 
  For government and industry to join together to sell, there 
naturally has to be a judgment that "comprehensive security" 
includes not only economics but diplomacy as well. 
Consequently, the NEC's equivalent in Japan would be not MITI 
but an organization bringing together the functions of the 
foreign, finance, and trade ministries. The proper description 
of the NEC would be the "Business Planning Board of the United 
States, Inc." Perhaps for that reason, the word making the 
rounds in Washington is not NEC but "Super NEC." 
<H5>  Trade Order Crisis </H5>
  The urgent topic of U.S. economic revival is without a doubt 
in the background to the Clinton administration's drastic 
changes. However, criticism has begun. As Brookings Institute 
Senior Researcher Bosworth puts it, "Government intervention in 
private enterprise is seen as excessive no matter what." The 
criticism results from the clear contradiction between the 
current administration's line and the past U.S. position that 
consistently attacked Japanese and European "joint 
public-private practices," including subsidies and industrial 
policy. In addition, business negotiations tied to diplomacy 
are dogged with opaqueness. 
  It would be easy for Japan, in order to confront a United 
States that has established a powerful and centralized 
organization to increase exports and resolve trade friction, to 
create the same type of system. With an eye on the goal of 
protecting the world trade order, however, following the U.S. 
lead here is not what is required of Japan. Should not Japan 
promote market opening and play the role of advising the United 
States?

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshito Komatsu, Tokyo Economic Department </F>
reporter: "Admitting Investment Advisers Into Public Pension 
Business"] 
  [Text] The financial services sector has been added to the 
demands for deregulation under the Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
The demands encompasse a total of 12 items including 
deregulation of pension fund and off-shore markets and 
consolidation of licensing for advisors handling investment 
trusts and other regular investments. The question is, will such 
external pressure succeed in opening a way into Japanese 
financial markets which are considered closed in nature compared 
to those of other advanced nations and where the Ministry of 
Finance (MOF) is said to exercise immense authority? This short 
series of articles examines the nature of the U.S. demands, 
problem areas of the Japanese systems, and the outlook for 
deregulation. 
  The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) presented a 
report to the Japanese and U.S. governments which stated, "The 
interests of many Japanese citizens are being compromised in the 
management of pension funds." The ACCJ has prepared several 
documents of this nature since last year distributing them not 
only to agencies in Japan such as the MOF and Ministry of Health 
and Welfare (MHW), but to the U.S. Treasury and influential 
members of Congress in a stepped-up effort to open the Japanese 
pension fund market. 
  The foremost issue presented in these documents is the 
demand 
that investment advisers be allowed to participate in the 
management of public pension funds. The ACCJ assertion is 
concise. Presently, Japanese public pension funds can be managed 
only by trust banks and life insurance companies, but the 
documents assert that investment advisory firms which specialize 
in the management of stocks can manage such funds in a manner 
which provides a higher rate of return. Fiscal year 1992 returns 
on the welfare pension fund came were 5.86 percent (return on 
designated pension based on current market value) when managed 
by trust banks and 5.5 percent (return based on dividends paid 
on general accounts) when managed by life insurance companies. 
In contrast, investment advisers produced an average return of 
6.65 percent. 
  A portion of the public pension reserves of the national 
pension fund and welfare pension fund are managed by the Pension 
Welfare Service Public Corporation (PWSC). The PWSC borrows 
funds from the Funds Management Division of the MOF and 
contracts with life insurance companies and trust banks for the 
management of the funds. The total funds to be managed in fiscal 
year 1994 is roughly $23 trillion yen. If the rate of return 
were to improve one percent, assets would be enhanced by 230 
billion yen. 
  There are three ways to secure funds to stabilize long-term 
fiscal administration of pension funds. They include reductions 
in benefits, increases in insurance premiums and enhancement of 
returns through better management of funds. ACCJ stresses, 
"Enhancement of returns through better management by using 
investment advisers benefits the public, but revision of 
benefits or insurance premiums will not be in the interests of 
the public." 
  An official of the MHW obliquely glared at the deregulation 
request from the U.S. side and cynically remarked, "I can't 
imagine that the MOF will cave into the request to allow 
participation by investment advisors in the management of 
pension funds." The MHW had requested approval to contract with 
investment advisors in connection with this fiscal year's budget 
request, but the MOF rejected the request. The MHW asserts that 
it would be illogical to approve the request under external 
pressure, in view of the disapproval in connection with the 
budget request. 
  The excuse used by the MOF in rejecting the request was, 
"There is the question of maintaining safety in view of any 
absence of guarantee on the principal." Officials at the MHW 
were dissatisfied with the explanation saying, "It lacks 
persuasiveness." The reason is that although provisions do exist 
for inclusion of guarantees on principal in contracts with trust 
banks, such provisions are not included. 
  The PWSC calculated the results of long-term management in 
order to demonstrate the ability to safeguard principal even 
when it is not guaranteed. The basis for calculating the 
returns from FY73 to FY93 was to devide dividends by the value 
of all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during the 
period. The average annual rate of return for the 20 years was 
9.65 percent and the assumption is that such a rate provides for 
coverage of any short-term risk. During the 20-year period, 
there were three years in which year-to-year declines in returns 
were suffered, with the largest decline being at 27.4 percent, 
but the long-term effects of such declines were minimal. If 
rates of return are calculated in five-year cycles, only two 
declines were found to have taken place and the rate of the 
decline was minimal at 7.1 percent. 
  One informed official leaked behind-the-scenes information 
when he said, "It appears MOF officials reached the conclusion 
that pension fund markets may be opened in connection with the 
Japan-U.S. summit held in February." Reportedly, a memorandum 
had been prepared listing the assertions of the Japanese and 
U.S. governments to clarify the disputed points concerning the 
opening of pension fund markets. Suspension of the negotiations 
has resulted in a postponement, but it appears that the 
intention was for both governments to discuss the issue on the 
basis of the memorandum and for the prime minister to arrive at 
some sort of agreement during his visit to the United States. 
  U.S. sources say, "The United States has prepared 
retaliatory 
legislation for the financial services sector and the European 
Union is ready to take coordinated action." They also point out 
that unlike the automotive issue, very few people would be 
injured as a result of the participation of investment advisors. 
The question now posed is, what actions should be taken to 
increase the source of pension benefits in the face of an aging 
society? It appears the MOF faces some difficult options.

<F P=106> [Article by Yosahiko Sakurai, Tokyo Securities Department </F>
reporter: "Consolidating Licenses for Investment, Investment 
Trust Fund Advisers"] 
  [Text] "A `cost barrier' exists in the Japanese investment 
trust market," or "the barriers are too high," are criticisms 
made by several major U.S. financial institutions as a result of 
studies conducted on the feasibility of participating in 
Japanese investment trust markets. There are no obvious 
regulations which restrict the entry of foreign investment 
advisory firms, but they say that the high costs associated with 
entering the market impede their participation. 
  U.S. investment advisory firms operating in Japan have 
compiled a confidential report entitled, "Outlook for 
Deregulation of Investment Management Services in Japan." The 
report suggests, "U.S. investment advisers licensed to provide 
discretionary investment advisory services should be allowed to 
expand into the management of pension funds, investment trusts, 
and other assets which are amenable to management as 
investments," specifically calling for a single license to cover 
investment advisory functions, discretionary accounts 
management, and investment trust management services. 
  Under the existing Japanese regulations, a U.S. investment 
advisory firm wishing to engage in investment trust services 
must apply for a separate investment trust license from the MOF 
and operate the activity as a separate subsidiary. Once the firm 
has been licensed, it must establish a separate office with 
independent staffing, equipment and office space which doubles 
its expenditures. 
  According to a U.S. investment advisory firm, "investment 
advisory services and investment trust services are mutually 
complementary," and the Japanese system of requiring separate 
licenses can only be considered "excessive protection of the 
domestic investment trust industry." They are especially 
distressed about this because "U.S. investment advisory firms in 
Japan are actually operating at a loss." Another reason the 
U.S. side is taking a firm stand on this matter is that Japanese 
investment advisory firms operating in the United States are 
free to provide investment trust services. 
  The U.S. side has lost patience with the formidable Japanese 
market barriers and has recently formed a government-private 
sector task force to fortify its market-opening demands. A 
typical example of such efforts is the "Investment Management 
Subcommittee" of the ACCJ. The subcommittee maintains close 
contact with the U.S. government by holding regularly scheduled 
monthly meetings with financial authorities at the U.S. embassy 
in Japan to discuss the closed nature of Japanese financial 
markets. 
  Actually, among the informal requests made by the U.S. 
Government in the area of investment trust deregulation, two 
items 1) mutuality of investment advisory services and 
investment trust services and 2) freedom for investment advisory 
firms to manage all classes of pension fund assets, have been 
discussed at the regularly scheduled meetings of the 
subcommittee and the U.S. embassy. Mr. Donald J. Mulvihill [as 
transliterated] of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan, who 
serves as chairman of the subcommittee, stresses the need to 
work as a "team" with the U.S. Government in saying, "Even if we 
seek deregulation separately, the MOF lacks the willingness to 
entertain our requests." 
  The Japanese have begun to act on the reform of investment 
trust markets in response to U.S. demands. On 22 June [1994], 
the Investment Trust Research Council, a private research unit 
of the MOF Securities Bureau's director general, will complete 
its work covering this area. U.S. investment advisory services 
will focus on the conclusions of this research council which had 
been studying the fundamental reform of investment trust 
services. 
  Sources in the administrative office's of MOF reveal that 
the 
draft of the report to be issued by the Investment Trust 
Research Council is expected to present a dual position for and 
against the issue of mutuality of investment advisory and 
investment trust management services. However, aside from U.S. 
investment advisory firms, the domestic banking industry has 
also stepped up its demand for mutuality in connection with turf 
battles within that industry. The U.S. is gaining confidence 
that the mutuality issue will be resolved in its favor in view 
of the "many allies within Japan itself." 
  The domestic investment trust industry assumes a 
conservative 
position and officially opposes the mutuality issue saying, 
"Problems will arise if investment advisory services provided to 
large investors and investment trust services involving a large 
number of investors are combined." However, the true sentiment 
of the industry was expressed by a major investment trust 
contracting firm's president when he said, "We will not oppose 
the mutuality concept if entry into the pension fund markets is 
approved." 
  The basic policy of the MOF concerning investment trust 
reform as expressed by the Securities Bureau is, "We hope to 
revise obsolete legislation." Precisely because of this position 
of the MOF, the view that "mutuality" will be an easy concession 
to U.S. demands as long as Japanese domestic industry sources do 
not pose major resistance is gaining prominence.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasuo Ota, Tokyo Economic Department reporter: </F>
"True Price Competition for 10-Year Government Bonds"] 
  [Text] There was a time when the MOF was not able to raise 
adequate funds because government bond issues were "not being 
fully subscribed to." The March bond issue of four-year 
medium-term government bonds with a nominal interest rate of 3.0 
percent, placed on auction on 24 February received a lukewarm 
reception. Only 645.8 billion yen in bonds were subscribed to 
against an offering of 700 billion yen. If not all of the bonds 
are subscribed to, procedures require a repeat of the auction 
process and this potentially inflates fund-raising costs. 
  The Japanese government has been forced to launch several 
repetitive economic countermeasures in the form of public works 
projects to stimulate the economy and the bond sales program, 
including refunding actions, will reach a historically high 36.5 
trillion yen. And given the recent trend in tax revenue 
deficits, a decrease in bond issues beyond the next fiscal year 
is hard to imargine. 
  Amidst such conditions, the United States has demanded that 
the proportion of 10-year government bonds sold under 
competitive bidding procedures be increased from 60 to 100 
percent. Whether the request will be accepted or not depends 
upon the consideration given to the issues of full subscription 
and the costs of selling the bonds. 
  At one time, government bonds were considered the means by 
which a nation raised funds and banks were called upon to form 
syndicates to assist in the sale of the bonds. However, the MOF 
exercised formidable authority in negotiating conditions for 
issuing government bonds because of the priority treatment 
extended to such bonds. Interest rates were set at levels lower 
than prevailing market rates and failure to attain full 
subscription never occurred. 
  However, issuance of higher volumes of government bonds led 
to deregulation. In 1989, the MOF began selling 40 percent of 
government bonds through the auction process. This was in 
response to demands from foreign securities firms that the bonds 
be subjected to market forces as a condition for issuance. The 
percentage was lifted to 60 percent in 1990. The MOF is no 
longer able to make decisions on the conditions for issuance of 
the bonds, because bond prices are now determined through the 
competitive bidding process. 
  However, foreign securities firms and banks have recently 
requested that the proportion of government bonds subject to the 
competitive bidding process be increased because the firms had 
experienced being unable to procure the amount of new issues 
they desired when the bonds had reached the imposed ceiling. 
  In reality, the demand lodged by the U.S. firms is similar 
to the one presented by major Japanese securities firms and 
influential Japanese banks. You might say that the demands 
represent the logic of formidable firms capable of selling to 
clients in a bull market. 
  However, in the case of foreign financial institutions, the 
logic of formidable firms applies only in bull markets when bond 
investments appear to be profitable. During bear markets the 
logic of freedom of choice applies. Major Japanese financial 
institutions admit, "We would like to handle large volumes of 
bonds in a bull market, but we feel like returning our share of 
the bonds in bear markets," but foreign firms practice what they 
preach. This reality gives birth to MOF fears of future failures 
to attain full subscriptions. 
  Currently, the 40 percent of bond issues not exposed to the 
competitive bidding process is handled broadly by syndicates 
including small-to-medium-sized Japanese financial institutions. 
U.S. interests consider this portion of bond issues as being 
handled on a restrictive basis, preventing them from acquiring 
their desired share, but for the MOF such syndicates serve as a 
reliable means of disposing of bonds during bear markets. 
  Although such bonds are not a major portion of overall 
issues, four-year government bonds have already failed once to 
reach full subscription under the 100-percent competitive 
bidding process but lack any mechanism for preventing a failure 
to achieve full subscription. Most government bonds are issued 
as 10-year bonds and the 40 percent not subject to competitive 
bidding serves as a safety net. If this safety net is eliminated 
and the fear that under-subscription will lead to higher 
fund-raising costs exists, it is easy to see that the 
100-percent bidding process cannot be adopted. It can also be 
pointed out that long-term interest rates could swing widely. 
  However, even within the MOF, there is a perception that, 
"During periods of declining interest rates, if the 100-percent 
competitive bidding process is implemented, high bids could 
result in the issuance of bonds at a lower cost, thus offsetting 
any concern of potential under-subscriptions." In reality, the 
United States, which is plagued by recurring deficits, has 
issued large amounts of government bonds, but has never faced 
the problem of under-subscription. 
  Deeply rooted criticism of the 100-percent competitive 
bidding process reflects skepticism over fears of 
under-subscription in Japan which is the world's second largest 
economy. Needless to say, the dollar is a core currency which 
encourages the purchase of dollar bonds, but there is also a 
deeply rooted view that Japan should take action to enhance the 
appeal of its government bonds beginning with the tax system. 
  As we near the summit of advanced nations, income tax cuts 
and offsetting consumption tax hikes, which are the current 
focus of Japan-U.S. trade talks, will shift to the topic of 
sources of funding if income tax cuts are implemented, in 
advance, separate from any hike in consumption tax. Undoubtably, 
there will be considerably more dependence on government bonds. 
Moreover, there is greater expectation of an economic recovery 
and long-term interest rates are on an upward trend. We are at a 
stage where the fear of under-subscription could magnify and a 
safety net might be advisable for the near-term, but attention 
will be focused on what the MOF will decide for the long-term.

  [Text] In connection with the task force on Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield, which the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed 
to establish in a 16 June meeting, Masanori Yoshimoto, 
lieutenant governor of the Okinawa Prefectural Government, 
issued a comment. 
  In the comment, the lieutenant governor said the task force 
is mandated to make a technical study of how to secure an 
alternative cite for the current parachute drop training ground; 
the possibility of relocating Sobe Communications Station; and 
ways to handle various problems arising from the Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield. 
  In his comment, Lieutenant Governor Yoshimoto also said: The 
return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield is important for promoting 
the industry of Yomitan town and stabilizing the livelihood of 
residents there. The Okinawans have strongly demanded the 
return of the airfield. The Okinawa Prefectural Government 
intends to strongly ask both the Japanese and U.S. Governments 
to have the airfield returned in a visible way before 1995, when 
the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War and battle 
for Okinawa is marked.

<F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Ito from the "Seiron" column: "Even If </F>
We Prohibit the Use of Nuclear Weapons, We Will Not Solve the 
Problem"] 
  [Text]Difference Between Arguments for Enacting, 
Interpreting Law 
  In response to the question from the International Court of 
Justice (ICJ) -- "Is a nation's use of nuclear weapons a 
violation under international law?" -- the Japanese Government 
at first planned to submit the following written statement: 
"Speaking from a purely legal point of view... one cannot say 
that it is a violation of today's positive international law. 
Due to the tremendous destructive and killing power of nuclear 
weapons, however, we believe that their use is not in accord 
with the spirit of humanitarianism that is the basis of 
international law." However, there arose a chorus of opposition 
from all over Japan voicing such reactions as, "The statement is 
not in accord with the popular sentiments of the only nation to 
suffer from atomic bombing." The government then submitted its 
written statement after removing the part "Speaking from a 
purely legal point of view... one cannot say that it is a 
violation." 
  What should we make of this? ASAHI SHIMBUN's 7 June 
editorial called the government's position "heartless." 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN's 8 June editorial criticized the Foreign 
Ministry: "One can only call the response that of legal 
gangsters." Certainly, one can understand how the written 
statement that "one cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons 
is a violation" does not square with the popular sentiment of 
Japanese who, having experienced the bombing of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, have since taken the lead in implementing the three 
nonnuclear principles, and appealed to the world for disarmament 
and the abolition of nuclear weapons. The immediate reaction of 
the people in this way, too, can certainly be considered a sound 
response. However, the nature of the nuclear problem is a 
complicated one. The people did not react after understanding 
the big picture and giving it dispassionate and mature 
consideration. Explaining the problem rationally to the people 
should remain the task of specialists and political leaders. Of 
course, diplomacy divorced from popular sentiment will not last. 
But it is also true that diplomacy errs in simply following 
popular sentiment. 
  The editorials from ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
themselves admit that "perhaps there is no treaty or agreement 
in which it is expressly written that the use of nuclear weapons 
is a legal violation" (ASAHI), and that "the fact is that there 
is almost certainly no international law or regulation 
prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons" (MAINICHI). Therefore, 
the argument becomes one for enacting a law: "If nonuse of 
nuclear weapons is not prescribed by international law, then it 
should be prescribed in accord with the times" (ASAHI). The 
problem the ICJ raised is an argument of interpretation. 
Therefore, ASAHI and MAINICHI have substituted the first type 
of argument for the second. If they had answered the problem 
squarely, ASAHI and MAINICHI would have had to say that, "One 
cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons is against the law." 
However, those taking the position that depends on the argument 
for enacting a law so that "the use of nuclear weapons is 
against the law" probably also wished to say "it is against the 
law" in the argument of interpretation as well. However, that 
is like the 17th-century Roman Catholic pope who demanded that 
Galileo accept the Ptolemaic theory that the sun revolves around 
the earth. Perhaps the Foreign Ministry officials are murmuring, 
"Even so, it is the earth that is revolving around the sun." 
<H5>  Hiroshima, Nagasaki Bombings Were Violations of </H5>
International Law 
  Of course, saying "one cannot say it is against the law" 
does 
not mean that one can therefore legally use nuclear weapons at 
any time and any place. In a war of aggression, the war itself 
is against the law, and thus so not only are nuclear weapons but 
the use of all weapons. The problem is that even for cases in 
which a war is legal (for example, in exercising the right to 
self-defense or in the military measures taken by the United 
Nations), the use of certain weapons is outlawed. The question 
is whether nuclear weapons are among them. In the balance 
between military effectiveness and humanitarian considerations, 
the call to prohibit the use of certain weapons comes when the 
latter consideration dominates (i.e., when suffering considered 
unnecessary is inflicted by the use of certain weapons despite 
there being other means to achieve the same military effect). 
Thus, the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 outlawed the use 
of explosives under 400 grams while not outlawing the use of 
those above 400 grams. Even if we were to ignore military 
effectiveness and outlaw the use of certain weapons on the 
grounds of humanitarianism alone, the act would actually have no 
effect. All weapons are basically inhumane. Speaking from a 
strictly humane point of view, the use of all weapons should be 
prohibited. 
  Incidentally, I believe the atomic bombing of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki by the United States was illegal under 
international law. However, my reasoning is not that the use of 
the atomic bombs was itself illegal (dropping an atomic bomb on 
the battleship Yamato under way at sea would have been 
completely legal) but that the act strayed from the principle of 
military targeting. The bombing was illegal as an 
indiscriminate attack upon a defenseless city, resulting in many 
casualties among peaceful citizens. In that sense, although 
atomic bombs were not used, the massive air raid against Tokyo 
on 10 March 1945 was an eminent violation of international law. 
<H5>  Inescapable Problem of Nuclear Deterrence </H5>
  However, the destructive and killing power of nuclear 
weapons 
is tremendous. A situation in which they would be used again is 
absolutely inexcusable for whatever reason. Turning at this 
point to the argument for enacting a law, it is natural for 
Japan, which maintains its three nonnuclear principles, to work 
to outlaw the use of nuclear weapons. However, precisely 
because we would not resolve all the issues in creating such a 
treaty, the problem is truly complicated. To what extent do 
Japanese understand this? The history of international 
relations is one of broken treaties. The real issue is creating 
an international management system to guarantee the 
implementation of the agreements. Then, for that to happen, we 
cannot escape from the problem of nuclear deterrence. Therein 
lies the true difficulty of this problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Masataka Kosaka, professor at Kyoto University: </F>
"`Skill in Setting Priorities' Is Demanded: Begin With Electoral 
Redistricting; Rushing on Taxes, Etc. Would Be Detrimental"] 
  [Text] 1) The complicated moves that occurred up to 
the birth of the Hata government were unavoidable in the process 
toward realignment of political circles. There is also a view 
which takes it in a cynical manner, but the benefit of such 
things as the point that it forced change upon the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is also great. 
  2) Concern has also emerged as to whether, with 
politics in tumult, it will be possible to overcome difficulties 
at home and abroad, but there are some problems which it is 
better not to rush in a clumsy manner. It is important to choose 
which are really urgent problems. 
  3) Apart from deciding on the budget and electoral 
redistricting on the domestic front, and Japan-U.S. relations in 
foreign affairs, rushing things could be detrimental. What is 
required of politicians is "skill in setting priorities." 
<H5>  Realignment of Political Circles Brings Change for the SDPJ </H5>
  On the 25th Tsutomu Hata was designated prime minister, but 
there were considerable complications. Even in just what was 
reported by the media, there were the complicated moves of 
Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake [Harbinger], and the 
uproar over LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] strongman Michio 
Watanabe leaving his party. Even beyond that, there appeared to 
be all sorts of maneuvering beneath the surface. There were both 
criticism and encouragement depending on the standpoint of the 
writer, but, overall, there was a strong cynicism that "politics 
is murky" any way. Last year's atmosphere, which welcomed talk 
of reform in a somewhat uncritical manner, no longer exists. 
  However, these kinds of moves surrounding the reins of 
government are essential to politics, and it is unavoidable that 
they become complicated, particularly when, as now, it changes 
to multiparty government. That cannot be avoided for the 
present, nor is there anything wrong with it. If one views it 
over a slightly longer term, it is the process by which the 
forces which split into multiple parties will be brought 
together. That became certain because the electoral system was 
reformed, and a single-seat constituency system was introduced. 
  Because, insofar as only one Diet member will be elected, it 
will be impossible to win if forces are scattered. That 
necessity for uniting was also an important factor in the 
process of political reform and became virtually dominant after 
the various political reform bills passed. The moves toward a 
new-new party, a united parliamentary group, as well as 
Sakigake's reaction against them, were things which involved the 
question of the form in which political circles would be 
realigned and reflect the necessity, in terms of political 
dynamics, that all must unite. 
  Second, the building of an alliance by small parties in 
order 
to form a government is, then, also the process by which their 
policies are adjusted to reached agreement. Each force has a 
different view, but they must compromise because of the 
necessity of forming a government, and for that reason, it also 
works out that they can find points in common. 
  The effect of that is particularly great in the case of 
Japan 
because it forces change upon the SDPJ. The SDPJ has, itself, 
rejected forming a government by advocating policies which are 
utterly impossible to put into practice such as in security 
treaty, fiscal, and economic policies. But in that case, there 
is no future for Japanese politics. We must have the SDPJ 
change, and in fact, since last summer the SDPJ has changed, bit 
by bit. 
  Of course this process will not go easily and will probably 
take considerable time. Even when there existed the unifying 
force of political reform, it was very difficult for the 
coalition government to operate. In the Uruguay Round, the SDPJ 
was unable to clearly change its former policy concerning what 
to do about liberalization of rice imports. It opposed partial 
importing of rice, but it temporized in such a way that the 
coalition government did not split. 
  But that can also be called a real change, and it turned out 
that way in good measure because of concern that if the 
coalition government broke up, a combination of different forces 
could form, which also included the LDP. 
  On the whole, the wall between governing and opposition 
parties has ceased to be as clear as it was a decade ago. What 
showed this vividly is that in the course of passing the 
political reform bills; some SDPJ members of the upper house 
carried through with dogmatic opposition and aborted the bills. 
But the political reform bills did not die because of that. The 
coalition governing parties compromised greatly with the LDP 
bills and by that means passed political reform. This shows that 
it became possible to cooperate across the governing 
party-opposition party wall on individual problems, even if a 
party does not go so far as to join the government. 
  Thus, the nature of the Japanese political game changed in a 
number of senses. Of course, the political situation will change 
in a bewildering manner because of that, and scheming will also 
become more intense. Persons who read only articles which report 
political moves in a cynical manner may dislike that. But there 
can be no realignment of political circles or such without that 
process. 
<H5>  There Are Very Few Urgent Problems </H5>
  A more direct concern is the question of whether, with 
politics in great tumult, Japan will be able to overcome present 
difficulties at home and abroad. This view was also heard 
between the time of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation and 
agreement on Prime Minister Hata. 
  But there is no use discussing like that, but the existence 
of pressing problems can turn out to be a unifying force. There 
are many things which are called pressing problems but are 
actually not that urgent. There are also things which are better 
not to rush in a clumsy way. Therefore, in considering politics 
in the future, the central problem is to select which are truly 
urgent problems and to consider the response to them. 
  First, as a problem which must not be dealt with hastily, 
there is the question of cooperation in elections because 
hurrying the creation of that system for next few months would 
result only in a reverse effect. 
  Next, as problems which should be dealt with speedily, there 
is the budget, of course, and one can probably list deciding on 
electoral redistricting. Without electoral redistricting amounts 
to the basic rules of the political game not being determined, 
as it were, so it would be impossible to have an election even 
if one were necessary. For the next election to be held using 
the system of medium-size districts because preparations for the 
new system were not made in time, even though the political 
reform bills passed, would be a big problem from the aspect of 
fairness. 
  But aside from these two problems, there are no tasks of 
domestic politics which are truly pressing. Certainly the 
prolonged recession is a problem, but there are no effective 
policies by the kind of measures that can be adopted right away. 
  It is not my intention to advocate a lack of policy, but I 
think that after the injections of stimulant which have already 
been administered, there is nothing to do but leave it to the 
natural course of the economy. Reform of the tax system and 
relaxation of regulations are certainly necessary, but are they 
really urgent necessities? It appears that, in order to carry 
those out, one would have to present the future image of Japan's 
economy in its entirety, and that, conversely, the harm would be 
greater in the case of rushing. 
  Then, what about tasks in foreign relations? Suspicion of 
North Korean development of nuclear weapons is doubtless a grave 
problem, and for its part Japan must make clear a firm resolve 
to not overlook illegal action by North Korea's and must 
indicate a posture of participating in international efforts to 
solve it. If such things as not carrying out the duties 
accompanying membership in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(accepting inspections) while participating in the treaty, and 
secretly developing nuclear weapons are given tacit permission, 
the nuclear nonproliferation system will become shaky. 
  But, when it comes to exactly what kind of measures for that 
purpose are possible and desirable, the situation is unclear. 
One wonders that it might be a hasty conclusion to think that a 
crisis will develop on and around the Korean Peninsula. 
Furthermore, as to the response to a crisis, nothing can be 
done but to decide, with wisdom and resolve, after the crisis 
has become real. 
  Regardless of who holds responsibility at that time, the 
fate 
of the nation depends on whether he will make the correct 
judgement, and whether public opinion will approve it. Debate 
and mental preparation are necessary, but it is not too wise to 
plan the response to a crisis beforehand. 
<H5>  The Urgent Diplomatic Task Is To Improve Japan-U.S. Relations </H5>
  Of the things that should be addressed, Japan-U.S. relations 
are more serious. And in regard to that point, I, too, am uneasy 
over whether things will go well with the current political 
setup. But that is not to say that we should hurry with a 
solution for economic friction because it was impossible to 
agree on at the February [1994] summit. That would be possible, 
but it would be the wrong way to solve it. The Japan-U.S. 
negotiations broke down because Japan rejected the "numerical 
targets" which the United States advocated, but even if we had 
them call it "objective criteria of progress" instead, it would 
be every bit as difficult for Japan to accept. Generally 
speaking, the view of "emphasizing results" determines the rules 
of trade as something among multiple countries and regulates 
them by that, but it violates the basic General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) principle of not regulating by quantity. 
  But, for various reasons, the United States will probably 
repeat the same kind of demand, and it will be difficult for 
Japan to accept it. In general, international opinion also 
opposes it, and even within the United States there are 
different views which cannot be ignored. Therefore, to 
compromise easily would affect Japan's reputation. The current 
situation is that, overall, the United States is in the midst of 
groping for a post-Cold War policy, and in the course of that it 
sometimes makes erroneous statements. Its human-rights diplomacy 
toward China and being a stickler on trade problems in 
Japan-U.S. relations are examples of that. 
  Thus, the solution in Japan-U.S. relations must include 
"no." 
But neither a world order nor an Asia-Pacific bloc is 
conceivable without the United States. This is particularly true 
for Japan, which is very fragile. Therefore, when Japan says 
"no," many more times than it says that, it must propose "let's 
do it this way." 
  Before that, there are many things which Japan must do in 
order to resolve the imbalance in Japan-U.S. economic relations. 
Relaxation of regulations is the most important of these, and 
that can be done by Japan's judgement. This kind of combination 
of "no," and "yes," and "proposals" is really difficult. But it 
must be done. 
  Politics is said to be "the art of the possible" because 
there are any number of things which one should do, and which it 
would be better to do, but few of them are possible. Politicians 
must choose things which must by all means be done at a certain 
point in time. At that time it is vital to not simply hurry, but 
to watch for a good chance to act. 
  That is particularly true in situations where many parties 
stand side by side. It was good that they worked out a 
compromise on policy though they spent time, but the situation 
is not so simple that agreement can be gained by that. 
Therefore, skill in setting priorities is required.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Follow-On Plan for the Heisei Slump"] </F>
  [Text] However the power relationships shift within the 
coalition government in the change from the Hosokawa to the Hata 
administration, there ought to be no change in the direction the 
Japanese economy takes. This means choosing to improve the 
qualitative life of the Japanese people by opening Japan's 
markets to the world. In order for the Hata administration to 
stimulate the structural changes that are finally underway, more 
than anything, deregulation and the opening of markets must not 
be allowed to play out as nothing more than religious 
incantations. 
  The shopping districts of Kanda, Tokyo are changing to a 
degree where we scarcely can believe our eyes. No sooner do new 
discount stores appear than they quietly disappear to be 
followed even cheaper outlets. At the forefront of the price 
revolution is the competition emerging between discount stores. 
  The leading supermarket chain, Daiei, has begun selling beer 
more cheaply while the department store, Mitsukoshi, has lowered 
prices on brand-name merchandise with the aim of lowering the 
differential between foreign and domestic prices to less than 
one and a half times. 
  The phenomena simultaneously making headway of correcting 
the 
differential between foreign and domestic prices and of reducing 
internal price differences has been called "price wrecking." 
However, perhaps it should be seen more as price normalization. 
Moreover, this is not a temporary trend in reaction to the 
bubble economy. It is the beginnings of structural change. 
<H5>  With the Earthshaking Changes in the World Economy </H5>
  Japanese just returning from living in the United States are 
surprised by the high prices found in Japanese discount stores, 
which ought to be appreciably cheaper. Suits and coats made in 
South and Central America and former East European countries 
sold in the United States are much cheaper than the same 
products sold in Japan manufactured in Asia. 
  The price revolution is spreading worldwide, reflecting the 
earthshaking changes in the post-Cold War world economy. Not 
only the newly industrializing economies [NIEs] of Asia but 
Central and South American and former East European countries 
are coming on stage as new exporting countries in the world 
market with a manufacturing base not much different from that of 
the industrialized nations. Moreover, they are beginning to 
produce lower priced products with lower wage rates than the 
industrialized nations. 
  In the United States and Europe, the view has strengthened 
that the continued apprehension over employment in 
industrialized countries is due to the labor situation in the 
developing countries, and they are trying to establish the issue 
of labor and trade as the central issue before the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). 
  Although how to respond to the advancing price revolution is 
an issue common to all the industrialized nations, the worst 
option is to revert to protectionist means in order to maintain 
employment levels in one's own country. This will only invite a 
shrinkage in world trade while generating trade friction and 
will only increase the number of unemployment. Japan has no 
choice but to link economic structural change to the worldwide 
price revolution by aiming to open its markets. 
  The falling price of goods and services has company managers 
on edge. With profits worsening, income shrinking, demand 
falling, and prices dropping, managers find themselves in a 
wicked deflationary environment, forcing them to worry about 
employment and the hollowing out of industry. 
  However, the earthshaking changes accompanying economic 
globalization and the shift of the world toward a market economy 
will bear costs the Japanese economy must accept. If we change 
our point of view, lower prices will increase real purchasing 
power and create new demand. If so, change the industrial 
structure with lower prices so that to expand the Japanese 
economy substantially. 
  Many firms are already responding to the price revolution. 
Even among automobile makers, some who have come to have a close 
transactional relationships with the steel makers, such as 
Mitsubishi Motors, are using steel plate manufactured relatively 
cheaply in South Korea. The research department of the 
Industrial Bank of Japan has come to the conclusion that this 
trend will spread to all industries. 
  An important player in the price revolution is the consumer. 
Consumers are sensitive to prices and shy away from those higher 
priced products which they used to purchase during the bubble 
economy--the phenomenon no longer exists. Instead, consumers 
will vie for quality goods to be purchased as cheaply as 
possible. While the Japanese consumers are certainly smarter 
than before, looking at the phenomenon by international 
standards, they are still an easy mark. 
  A study done by the Economic Planning Agency calculating the 
differential in foreign and domestic prices estimated that in 
November 1993 prices were 1.4 times as high in Tokyo as in New 
York City. This level is unchanged from 1988 and demonstrates 
that domestic prices in Japan do not at all reflect the advance 
of the high yen. From this, we can see that aside from housing 
costs, which were not included, the cost for someone to live in 
Tokyo is considerably higher than for someone in New York. 
<H5>  Don't Let Regulations Hinder Change </H5>
  It will not do for the Hata administration, which will be 
launched this week, any more than the LDP and Hosokawa 
administrations up to now, to merely mouth deregulation and the 
opening of markets. No government, with the earthshaking changes 
taking place in the world economy, has the right to hinder the 
restructuring of the Japanese economy by the retention of 
regulations. 
  Establishing conditions for strengthening competition 
through 
deregulation is the common business of the government. This 
means graduating from the industrial policy we've had up to this 
point and strengthening antimonopoly policies. It is appropriate 
that Japan, which has the largest current account surplus of any 
country, fully open its markets to the world. No result will be 
achieved by ministries and agencies pushing deregulations and 
opening of markets. We must not repeat the failure of the 
Hosokawa administration, who left this to the bureaucrats. 
  With open markets providing a lever for structural change, 
of 
particular importance will be a new cooperative existence with 
Asia. Until now, Asia has imported capital and interim resources 
in response to the influx of capital from Japan and has 
developed by exporting products to the United States. The 
relationship between Asia and Japan in the future will shift 
from a vertical division of labor to a horizontal one. Japan 
will be a market for Asia and Asia a market for Japan. 
  The prerequisite is nothing less than a high degree of 
pushing Japanese industry forward. For that, we need an 
industrial vision, but this is certainly not the business of 
government. Rather, it is best that this sprightly vision emerge 
from research organizations and private companies and not be 
government manufactured. In the vision will be depicted the 
throng of diverse small and medium-sized companies that will 
give birth to new demand. Fresh competition and employment 
opportunities will surely emerge with smart consumers and 
through the creative ability of private companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Takashi Sawada, chief researcher, Enterprise </F>
Survey Department, Nikko Research Center: "Petrochemical 
Industry Reorganization Proceeding With Focus on Big Business 
Groupings; MITI No Longer Relied Upon"] 
  [Text] Recession in the petrochemical industry can be 
diagnosed as the "worst ever in the postwar era." The gap 
between supply and demand has spread into the whole Asian 
market, and consumer needs have changed. To cope with the 
structural causes and work out ways to survive, drastic reforms 
accompanied by industrial restructuring and personnel 
adjustments are unavoidable. 
<H5>  Worst Recession Since the War </H5>
  For the petrochemical industry, the total profits of the 
major (ethylene center) 12 companies is expected to add up to 
deficits in fiscal year 1993 approaching 100 billion yen. Hence, 
it is falling into the worst postwar recession, even beyond that 
of fiscal year 1982 (60.5 billion yen in the red) following the 
oil crisis. 
  Petrochemical products represented by synthetic resins are a 
typical cyclical industry, and swings in earnings due to 
business cycles have been large before, too. (When demand 
increases under favorable conditions, prices rise steeply; and 
as increases in facilities and recession weigh heavily, prices 
drop sharply.) 
  However, since the current recession has not only cyclical 
causes, but it also has structural causes, the situation is 
quite serious. 
  Structural problems can be categorized into the following 
three points: 
  1. Supply-demand gap widening 
  The petrochemical industry (like all others) broadly 
expanded 
its facilities during the bubble era. As it takes three to four 
years from a planning decision for facilities to go operational, 
increases in the facilities' capacity are still continuing even 
now. To look at ethylene facilities, which constitute the 
starting point for the production flow of petrochemical 
products, in addition to the startup of Mitsubishi 
Petrochemical's new plant in the fall of 1992, Maruzen 
Petrochemical's plant, whose startup had been delayed, finally 
is going into operation this fall [1994]. 
  As a result, the supply-demand gap has widened to the level 
of that after the oil crisis and the operating rate has dropped 
to around 80 percent. 
  To look at the demand side on the other hand, demand to date 
for petrochemical products has been attaining GNP-plus-alpha 
growth through the substitution of plastics for metals, paper, 
and so on, but now it has come to a turning point. That is 
because such major users as electricals and autos have shifted 
production overseas and plastic product imports are steadily 
increasing. 
  2. Falling international competitiveness due to 
worsened international demand and the high yen 
  It was not Japan alone that increased facilities during 
economic expansion. The same was true for the United States and 
Europe. In the same vein, however, the Republic of Korea's 
facility expansion was amazing. It expanded its facilities 
threefold in the three years from 1990 to 1992. 
  To look at ethylene in the Asian region, it appears that 
with 
demand at about 12 million tons annually there is an excess 
facilities capacity of more than 2 million tons. The result is 
that, together with prices falling internationally and the rapid 
rise in the yen to nearly $1 = 100 yen, differences have widened 
between international prices and Japanese domestic prices viewed 
on a dollar basis. The pressure of Korean-made synthetic resins 
exported to Japan is climbing, and Japan's domestic prices have 
plummeted, having been dragged down by international prices. 
  In the past, Southeast Asian markets were affected in their 
prices by Japan's domestic demand, being an escape valve for 
excess facilities in Japan. But now the situation has completely 
reversed, and Japan's domestic market is affected by demand in 
Southeast Asian market. 
  3. Changes in consumer needs 
  Finally, one must mention that the demand structure that had 
been supporting Japan's petrochemicals has broken down. Japan's 
domestic prices for synthetic resins have long been higher than 
international prices (the prices at which they sell in countries 
other than Japan). This was because qualities such as 
appearance, strength, and heat resistance were required of them 
for cars, containers, and polyethylene bags. The resin 
manufacturers spent huge sums on development costs and 
meticulously developed many varieties of resin. This "excessive 
product quality" can be said to have supported the growth and 
earnings of Japan's petrochemical manufacturers. 
  However, the times changed and consumers have come to demand 
lower prices even at some sacrifice in performance. As a result, 
the weight of research and development costs has surfaced all at 
once. 
<H5>  Inefficient Industry Structure </H5>
  Petrochemical companies are more numerous in Japan than in 
Europe or the United States but are smaller in scale. This is 
because the petrochemical industry is a new industry born after 
the war, and anyone could get into it by technology induction if 
one had the money. 
  Besides this, a huge infrastructure of land and port was 
needed for the petrochemical complexes, so there were much 
regulation and guidance by the government concerning their 
formation and growth. 
  Circumstances being such, the petrochemical industry tends 
to 
"rely on the government." At the time of the oil crisis the "Law 
of Temporary Measures To Improve Industrial Structure" (or Law 
on Industrial Structure) was devised by the initiative of MITI 
[Ministry of International Trade and Industry] and market 
conditions were improved by industry-wide scrapping of 
facilities. 
  This time, however, it does not seem that such solutions can 
be taken under government guidance. First, we are in an era in 
which leadership by the government is being criticized. In fact, 
it cannot be denied that the law on industrial structure, by 
letting firms with weak competitiveness survive and protecting 
an inefficient industrial structure, has become one cause of the 
hard times for today's petrochemical industry. 
  Next, even if excess facilities in country are scrapped, the 
effect of improving market conditions is slight so long as 
international demand is not improved. 
  At present, MITI is studying a project for exporting used 
ethylene plants to China; however, since dismantling costs 
climbing to huge sums, this has scant chance of being realized. 
Moreover, even if it were carried out, one could scarcely expect 
any effect of improving market conditions. 
  Then, might Japan's petrochemical industry go right ahead 
and 
perish? To state the conclusion, its survival is possible, but 
drastic structural reforms are needed that include the 
industry's restructuring and personnel adjustments. 
  When one considers major petrochemical corporations with 
some 
4,000 employees merging, staffs for the new post-merger 
companies' management sectors, sales sectors, and research and 
development sectors basically would get by with those of just 
one pre-merger firm. As about half of the employees are believed 
to be the staffs of such sectors, a cut to about 2,000 people 
could be accomplished through a merger, and a rationalization 
effect of some 15 billion yen might emerge from it. Even 
premising current market conditions, this is a level making it 
possible to go into the black.

  The ratio for personnel costs in the petrochemical industry 
is a low of about 10 percent, making it inconceivable that the 
industry would disappear merely because its own national 
currency is costly, as the U.S. steel industry (blast furnace) 
did. At present in industrialized nations, petrochemical 
industries are living on quite nicely. However, in the United 
States and European countries (especially the United States) the 
industry has been made more efficient by selling enterprises 
during times of recession and by mergers and so on. At the same 
time, major manufacturers of chemicals were quick to give up on 
general purpose items and have gone strongly into products close 
to consumers such as pharmaceuticals or into fine chemical 
products with a high added value. 
  The problems with Japan's petrochemicals are that each 
company is small in size, that there are too many companies, and 
that in their meticulous development they have put too much into 
people and money. 
  Having so far been a growth industry as it has existed, the 
petrochemical industry has set petrochemicals at the core of the 
enterprise in each company but has been slow to notice that it 
had changed into a declining industry that could not survive 
without rationalization. 
  For petrochemical firms, cutting staffs decisively by 
merging 
and restructuring is inescapable. At the same time, turning 
their reserve power in research and development toward such new 
fields as biotechnology and acquiring research and development 
capacities on a par with Europe and the United States will be 
the only way that Japan's chemical industries can survive into 
the 21st century. 
<H5>  Next Restructuring To Be Mitsui Group </H5>
  Even though the need for restructuring the industry is 
understood intellectually, it is difficult to go into mergers 
that will bring pain. Particularly in Japan, a company belongs 
to its employees, and managers balk at a merger that will wipe 
out the company itself. The very way that a company should be is 
what stands in the way of industrial restructuring. Yet, it may 
be that we are already past the stage for saying such things. 
Some companies have reached the end even of their off-the-books 
assets and are in a situation where they can no longer wait. In 
addition, banks are also straitjacketed by the problem of bad 
loans and are losing the leeway to support companies in deficit. 
  On 24 December 1993, Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi 
Petrochemical Co., Ltd. announced they would merge on 1 October 
1994. This move can be seen as their proclamation that they had 
given up on any rescue by the government or cartel character for 
the industry and would survive on their own power. For firms 
still in the process of asking favors of MITI, it was a dash of 
cold water and meant they would have to grope for the means of 
their own survival. 
  Scenarios for industry restructuring are seen as proceeding 
in two stages: 1) consolidating financial groupings and 2) 
rescue mergers by the financial groupings. (See table) 
  The top-ranking manufacturers in the financial groups stand 
out prominently in the aspects both of enterprise development 
and firm strength, which includes their off-the-books assets, 
and they may become the nuclei for restructuring. Following the 
Mitsubishi group, the Mitsui group can achieve vertical 
development from raw materials through finished products if it 
undertakes mergers including Toray Industries, Inc. (Toray's 
president Maeda is busily sending love calls to Mitsui 
Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.), and it can give birth to a 
powerful chemical company. 
  Again, all the firms are officially pressing ahead with 
cost-cutting by things like rationalization and tieups, working 
to get into the black on their own. Yet, the top managers from 
the hard-pressed companies seem to be groping for decisive 
measures. Both personnel cuts, which so far have been taboo in 
Japan, and programs to transfer the middle-aged and seniors to 
small and medium enterprises may be pushed ahead as the nucleus. 
  Around the end of 1995, the appearance of the industry may 
differ considerably from today's. With China's economic 
development, stagnant international market conditions also can 
be expected gradually to recover. We hope that in two or three 
years, the industry's restructuring will have reinforced its 
character and that a reborn petrochemical industry will be seen.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk by </F>
FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW correspondent Nate Thayer, in 
Beijing on 11 June: "Nude, Absolutely Naked"] 
  [Text] Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk has revealed that 
North Korean President Kim Il-song had asked him on June 1 to 
pass a message to the United States about tensions on the Korean 
peninsula, but "I have had no opportunity to tell (U.S.) 
officials," the king told the REVIEW. 
  "Kim II-song is my best friend," Sihanouk said, "He told me 
this: `please tell your American friends, brother Sihanouk, for 
my part I will not be the aggressor in a possible war . . . but 
if the Americans or others start the war we are ready to 
respond. We are prepared to face a big war and it will not be 
victorious. We will be able to resist and avoid defeat. They 
will be able to destroy the infrastructure of Korea, but we have 
our underground equipment and we will be able to resist even an 
atomic war'." 
  Sihanouk quoted Kim as telling him: "We do not need to 
negotiate with the UN or others, but we need direct negotiations 
with the United States of America." 
  According to Sihanouk, Kim said: "The reason we refuse 
inspection in depth is just this: we only have secret defence 
systems and organisations and the Americans know, perhaps, that 
we have no nuclear weapons, but they want to know what exactly 
our defence system with conventional weapons is. That is the 
reason they want the UN atomic agency to make inspections in 
depth. We cannot accept that. Besides the question of our 
sovereignty and national dignity and pride, we have our secrets." 
  Kim told Sihanouk: "Please compare us to a man: They want us 
to take off our shirt, our coat, and now our trousers, and after 
that we will be nude, absolutely naked. What they want us to be 
is a man without defence secrets, just a naked man. We cannot 
accept that. We would rather accept a war. If they decide to 
make war, we accept the war, the challenge we are prepared for." 
  Sihanouk told the REVIEW: "I think the warning should be 
taken seriously. On the one hand, Kim II-song wants me to say a 
few words to America. So I have a golden opportunity with you 
to tell America . . . the words were not hostile at all. But 
he says `we are prepared, and if America wants a war with us, 
OK, we accept' . . . on the other hand, Washington more or less 
despises Sihanouk .... He (Kim) prefers negotiations--even 
without positive results--the continuation of negotiations . . . 
he said tell your American friends, but I have had no 
opportunity to tell the officials. No, I don't, need to tell 
the officials, as I have been telling you; (anyway) they despise 
me."

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has 
welcomed North Korea's decision to allow inspectors to stay 
behind in North Korea. The agency, however, revealed that it 
has not received any notification regarding this from North 
Korea. IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that the IAEA welcomes 
such a step taken by North Korea since it corresponds with IAEA 
demands. He added that the IAEA maintains close contacts with 
its two inspectors still in Yongbyon.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has 
welcomed President Kim Il-song's promise to allow IAEA 
inspectors to stay in North Korea, but it has indicated that it 
is too early to assess if North Korea fulfills obligations of 
the Nuclear Safeguards Accord. 
  In an interview with an Austrian radio station today, IAEA 
spokesman David Kyd stressed that it is important to confirm if 
IAEA inspectors would have access to North Korea's seven 
declared nuclear facilities and that at present no details have 
been disclosed regarding it. He also said that details must be 
disclosed within a few days. 
  Regarding North Korea's announcement that it will observe 
obligations of the Nuclear Safeguards Accord, a Vienna-based 
diplomatic source said that such a proposal by North Korea 
cannot be a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue and 
stressed: To find a breakthrough, North Korea should announce 
that it would allow the IAEA team to inspect their seven 
declared facilities. Actually, the nuclear inspections should 
be carried out in North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea on Friday 
cautiously welcomed North Korean leader Kim Il-song's 
indications that his country would remain in the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
spoke over the phone with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher early Friday morning and was briefed about former 
President Jimmy Carter's meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, ministry 
officials said. 
  "We consider Kim's remarks as an indication that North 
Korea is willing to resolve the nuclear problem through 
dialogue," a Foreign Ministry official said in reaction. 
  "We will, of course, have to wait until we hear directly 
from 
Carter on his talks with Kim," the official said, "but we 
cautiously welcome North Korea's gesture." 
  Kim was quoted as telling Carter in their first meeting 
Thursday that his government has changed its mind and will let 
two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) remain in North Korea. 
  Another ministry official called this a highly symbolic move 
on Pyongyang's part, since permission for the inspectors to stay 
suggests North Korea will remain in the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime. 
  Carter and Kim are to hold a second meeting Friday before 
the 
former U.S. President returns to Seoul. 
  Pyongyang has threatened repeatedly to bolt the NPT if the 
U.N. Security Council went ahead and adopted a sanctions 
resolution. A draft of the resolution was circulated Thursday. 
  CNN reported that Kim said North Korea would not engage in 
any reprocessing or refueling, the two core activities involved 
in producing plutonium. 
  "We have yet to verify this part, but if true, we certainly 
welcome that," the ministry official said. "This is the right 
way to guarantee transparency in present and future nuclear 
activities." 
  Of minor concern here was Kim's failure to mention anything 
about clarifying his country's past nuclear activities. "But 
this does not have to be done before North Korea-U.S. high-level 
dialogue. This issue was to be discussed at the high-level 
dialogue, anyway," the official said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will first 
verify the exact meaning of North Korea's suggestions to former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter and consult with Washington before 
deciding on future action, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho said Friday. 
  "They are all indications," Chang said at a press briefing 
in 
reaction to reports that North Korean leader Kim Il-song told 
Carter he would let International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspectors remain in North Korea and was willing to keep 
monitoring equipment in operation. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a 
statement from the White House after receiving a report from 
Carter, suggesting that Washington may enter into the next round 
of high-level dialogue with Pyongyang if these positive 
indications are confirmed. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu talked with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher three times Friday morning to discuss 
Carter's report and consult on the wording of Gallucci's 
statement, Chang said. 
  Noting North Korea's desire to resolve the nuclear crisis, 
Gallucci said the Stalinist nation's suggestions would indeed be 
constructive "if it means that North Korea is also committed to 
freezing the major elements of its nuclear program while new 
talks took place -- that is, not refueling the reactor or 
reprocessing the spent fuel it has just removed and permitting 
the IAEA to maintain the continuity of safeguards." 
  "The government plans to continue to pursue negotiations on 
the sanctions resolution at the United Nations," Chang said. 
  "We will be briefed by Carter tomorrow on the results of his 
North Korean visit. We will decide what to do after 
consultations with the U.S. side," the spokesman noted.

  [Text] United Nations, June 16 (YONHAP) -- The United 
States held an informal meeting Thursday afternoon with the 10 
non-permanent members of the UN Security Council to discuss a 
draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea. 
  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright 
told 
reporters that although North Korea had signaled reconciliation 
in talks with former American leader Jimmy Carter, President 
Bill Clinton instructed her to continue discussions with the 
council members on sanctions against North Korea. 
  Asked how the new offer by North Korea would affect the push 
for sanctions, she said she could not disclose it as the U.S. 
Government was studying the proposal. 
  In view of remarks by Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Gallucci that Washington would consider holding a third round of 
talks with Pyongyang, the members of the Security Council are 
expected to slow down their sanctions deliberations.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government, judging that the North Korean nuclear dispute has 
entered a new phase with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's 
visit to Pyongyang serving as a turning point, has decided to 
concentrate on a peaceful solution to the issue through dialogue 
such as a high-level meeting between Washington and Pyongyang. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, in close contact with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is closely monitoring 
Carter's second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il-song 
Friday. 
  The government will announce its position on North Korea's 
new sign of reconciliation after President Kim Yong-sam meets 
with Carter over the weekend to discuss the results of his 
Pyongyang visit. 
  But the government will continue to push for a U.N. Security 
Council resolution on sanctions against North Korea if there is 
no positive change in its nuclear policy. 
  The decisions came at a Unification and Security Policy 
Coordination Committee meeting presided over by Unification 
Minister Yi Hong-ku Friday to discuss the overture made by North 
Korea at Carter's first meeting with Kim Il-song Thursday. 
  In case the high-level U.S.-North Korea talks resume, the 
government will push to secure the transparency of the North's 
past nuclear development activities. 
  Carter reportedly said the Washington-Pyongyang talks may 
resume if North Korea freezes its nuclear program. 
  Preparing for the possibility that North Korea's peace 
offensive is designed to avoid international sanctions through 
delaying tactics, the government will continue seeking the 
cooperation of China, Russia and other countries to gain U.N. 
Security Council passage of a sanctions resolution on North 
Korea. 
  Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said the 
government will reveal its position on developments during 
Carter's visit to Pyongyang after President Kim is briefed by 
the former U.S. leader Saturday. 
  The government will concentrate on finding a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue through dialogue, he added. 
  Foreign Minister Han talked over the phone with Secretary 
Christopher Thursday evening and Friday morning to discuss what 
Kim Il-song told Carter during their meeting Thursday. 
  "Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a 
statement this morning as a result of Han's telephone 
conversation with Christopher," the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Report on meeting between Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and </F>
reporters in Seoul on 16 June on the draft resolution for UN 
sanctions against North Korea -- by reporter Yang Sung-hyon] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu announced on 16 June: 
"The government has accepted the draft resolution worked out by 
the Untied States on the UN Security Council sanctions on North 
Korea." He then said that he "will make every possible 
diplomatic effort for this draft resolution to be adopted." 
  In an emergency meeting with reporters on the morning of 
that 
day, Minister Han said the above and added: "Our government's 
intent has considerably been reflected in the draft resolution." 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the composition of the draft 
resolution worked out by the United States? 
  [Han Sung-chu] It is composed of a preamble and 20-point 
text. It can be summed up into the preamble and seven sorts of 
sanctions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is the Russian proposal for 
eight-party talks mentioned in the draft resolution? 
  [Han] It does not directly mention the Russian proposal but 
specifies that international talks could be promoted if North 
Korea meets the demands expressed in the resolution. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does it include any warning to North 
Korea of sanctions that may be imposed on it if North Korea 
declares its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? 
  [Han] Yes, it does. For example, suspension of remittances 
to North Korea and the freezing of assets are mentioned. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is China's reaction to it? 
  [Han] I think China was notified of the U.S. draft 
resolution on the evening of 15 June our time. However, I have 
received no information on China's reaction. At present, it is 
hard to predict the Chinese reaction. What China must 
immediately decide is whether it will discuss the resolution 
with members of the UN Security Council or will express its own 
position on the draft resolution first. I think we shall learn 
it soon. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How much has our intent been 
reflected in the draft resolution? 
  [Han] The draft considerably reflects the result of working- 
level discussions by the ROK, the United States, and Japan that 
was confirmed during my recent visit to the United States. It 
contains effective constitution [hyogwajogin naeyong]. I think 
it will be a very strong means of pressure if it is adopted as 
it is. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What influence has North Korea's 
declaration of its withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency exerted upon the draft resolution? 
  [Han] It accelerated the speed of working out the draft, 
rather than influenced its contents. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the UN Security Council 
will proceed with the adoption of the draft by putting it to a 
vote? 
  [Han] We have to see the result of further discussions on 
it. However, whether it will be put to a vote or not depends on 
North Korea's attitude, not on further discussions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The draft resolution contains an 
item forbidding the export of weapons. I wonder if it includes 
the authority to search ships. 
  [Han] Embargo means more than the ban of exports. As is 
seen in all other resolutions on sanctions, a formula on the 
details of sanctions in this draft will separately be prepared. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What sanctions can we exercise? 
  [Han] Since it is based on international cooperation, I 
think we have to play a big role when the draft is adopted. We 
will have many to do so diplomatically and bilaterally [with 
North Korea]. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How are behind-the-scene contacts 
between the United States and North Korea going? 
  [Han] Although U.S. media report that they have contacts 
behind the scene, there has been no enveloped move between them. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is your opinion on the 
nullification or abolition of the declaration on denuclearizing 
the Korean peninsula that is included in the draft on sanctions? 
  [Han] The government has mentioned that it is difficult to 
implement the declaration on denuclearization, but it is not 
reconsidering it. It is the government's basic principle that 
the declaration on denuclearization should be implemented.

  [Text] North Korea's nuclear issue, which had entered a 
confrontational stage because of North Korea's withdrawal from 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, seems to face a new 
phase with the talks between former U.S. President Carter and 
North Korean President Kim Il-song. 
  This morning, the government held a Unification-National 
Security Coordination Council meeting during which it fine-tuned 
its position not to oppose the third round of talks between the 
United States and the North if North Korea's new conciliatory 
gesture, including its policy of allowing inspectors to remain 
in the DPRK--revealed by former U.S. President Carter now on a 
visit to the North--turns out to be true. 
  However, if the U.S. Clinton administration focuses on 
having 
North Korea freeze its nuclear development plan, it will be 
difficult to guarantee the transparency of its past nuclear 
suspicion. On the basis of this judgment, the government decided 
to convey to the U.S. side its firm position on this point. 
  The government also decided to fine-tune its final position 
after President Kim Yong-sam is briefed on the result of former 
President Carter's visit to the North, who will return to Seoul 
through Panmunjom tomorrow.

  [Text] The National Defense Ministry disclosed that North 
Korea has not demonstrated any peculiar military moves, while it 
is now intensifying its peace offensive to the United States 
through the talks between former U.S. President Carter and 
President Kim Il-song as momentum. 
  The Ministry of National Defense disclosed in a report on 
moves by North Korea: North Korea is proclaiming over loud 
speakers directed at the South's front line that it neither has 
the intention nor the capability to develop nuclear weapons, 
while stressing that they will not withdraw from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency until the nuclear issue is 
resolved through dialogue [iaearul taltoe haji anul kossimul

  The Ministry of National Defense also disclosed: Although 
the North Korean Air Force continues to be somewhat actively 
engaged in flight exercises, its ground force and Navy are not 
showing any particular movements except their routine guard 
activities.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of Defense 
revealed Friday that the military activities of North Korea's 
Army and Navy are not surpassing peacetime levels while those of 
the Air Force have picked up slightly. 
  In the first briefing on Pyongyang's military activities 
since it decided to keep the media informed on a daily basis, 
the ministry added that the North Korean Air Forces' activities 
involved flight training within the boundaries of their bases 
and no threatening tactical training was being conducted. 
  The ministry quoted radio Pyongyang as saying that "the 
nuclear problem and other outstanding issues could be solved 
smoothly if the United States respected our sovereignty and 
treated us fairly." However, the ministry said Pyongyang was 
waging psychological warfare by also denouncing Seoul through 
its central broadcasting station, which commented that "the 
South's insistence on the inevitability of sanctions on the 
North is an anti-national act which is aimed at hurting (those 
of) the same blood." 
  It said the North's strategy is intended to foster unrest 
and 
confusion in the South. "It is desirable for the people not to 
react sensitively to each threatening word from the North but to 
devote themselves instead to their jobs."

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- Although international 
concern over the possibility of an all-out war on the Korean 
peninsula is deepening, defense officials here in general 
believe that North Korea is unlikely to provoke an armed 
conflict. 
  The officials say their judgment is based on the North's 
current military power, the combined defense capability of South 
Korean and U.S. military forces, and the political stands of 
major powers around the peninsula including the United States, 
China and Russia. 
  Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this week, inviting possible 
sanctions by the United Nations and heightening tension on the 
peninsula. 
  The United Nations Security Council is discussing adoption 
of 
a draft sanctions resolution, while North Korea has warned that 
any sanctions would amount to a "declaration of war." 
  As further grounds for their assessment, the defense 
officials are citing vulnerable points that undercut the North's 
quantitative military superiority over the South. 
  The performance of North Korea's weapons systems, ministry 
officials explained, is not very good and the "military exercise 
period" of its Air Force and Navy is only one-third that of the 
South. Moreover, the ability of the North's quartermaster 
supply including war material and ammunition is low, the 
officials said. 
  In particular, shortages of oil and food would hamper North 
Korea from continuing an all-out war over a certain perriod of 
time. The rates of self-supply for oil and food are just 40 
percent and 60 percent, respectively, according to the ministry. 
  On the combined defense capability of South Korean and U.S. 
Forces, the ministry said that even if North Korea provoked a 
war, the South Korea-U.S. combined military power could repel an 
attack in the early stages. 
  Hundreds of thousands of ground forces, several carrier 
battle groups, hundreds of warships and thousands of fighter 
planes would be added to the current combined forces to produce 
an overwhelming victory against North Korea in a very short 
period. 
  With its war capacity, the Defense Ministry expects that 
North Korea would not dare to provoke an armed conflict unless 
Kim Il-song gave in to despair and decided to commit virtual 
suicide, the officials said. 
  Finally, although Russia and China have not expressed 
support 
for a UN sanctions resolution, they do not want North Korea to 
develop nuclear weapons, either. That point is an important 
factor mitigating against war on the Korean peninsula, they 
emphasized. 
  These countries are not actively supporting UN sanctions 
against North Korea in a bid to increase their influence, but it 
is unlikely they would back the reclusive nation militarily if 
it provoked a war. 
  "North Korea could never provoke a war under the 
circumstances," a senior official said. 
  "The United States can easily concentrate its military power 
on the Korean peninsula since it is not intervening militarily 
anywhere in the world at the moment." 
  But the officials are not ruling out the possibility that 
North Korea may provoke a local skirmish near the truce line.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Crisis Over North's Nuclear Issue and the </F>
People's Attitude"] 
  [Text] Public sentiment, which had shown little distress 
characteristic of a mature disinterest, has now started to 
display a gradual uneasiness. It has been reported grocery 
stores are crowded with people stockpiling packed Chinese 
noodles, tissue paper, and butane fuel. Anticipating and 
preparing for a disaster is a natural act of a head of a family 
and this is an act not to be criticized. Our people are 
instinctively accustomed to preparing for a disaster with the 
irrational unpredictable group ruling in the North. 
  We need to ponder, however, if our immediate reaction to 
overcome the present crisis should be stockpiling daily 
necessities. Will stockpiling material goods really help us get 
out of the serious crisis we might be facing? Will we be able 
to boil the Chinese noodles if the water and electricity supply 
is cut off in a high-rise apartment? 
  Instead, we ought to begin to exercise self-restraint and 
pull ourselves together. We should rectify the trend of society 
that is moving toward depravity in which imprudent people do not 
care about the country or society in their decadent extravagance 
and in which people in their selfish indulgence do not know the 
virtue of living together. We must turn these social conditions 
into a healthy social environment. 
  To this end, we should refrain from making vain assurances, 
political circles should stop the insincere habit of dividing 
and feuding, and the leading circles should reflect if they have 
given up the habit of hurting the other side even in a crisis. 
  The North's motive in continuing war threats against us, 
while it has no possibility of winning the war, is evident. The 
North intends to cause confusion and damage in the South, 
thereby securing an advantageous position in negotiations. What 
is the way to stop in advance the North's provocation, which the 
North can perpetrate foolishly. Our natural resources were not 
responsible for the material wealth we were able to attain from 
the helpless poverty and scars of war -- it was our spiritual 
ability that enabled us to achieve what we have today. 
Therefore, what the North's reckless group fears is our 
stubborn spiritual ability. If we run about in confusion and 
panic, the North will focus on this disaster. We should 
maintain a firm stance and arm ourselves with the will to 
overcome the national crisis. This could lead the North's 
rulers to reconsider their foolish illusion. 
  The government is setting up a contingency plan to cope with 
an emergency. Instead of stockpiling, which is prompted by 
selfishness and which causes confusion, we should help the 
government carry out its plan to deal with the crisis and 
explore ways to survive together. This is a more effective way 
to cope with the crisis. Civil defense exercises, training 
programs, and air-raid and disaster drills should realistically 
educate citizens to overcome the emergency. We are confident we 
will win. To win, however, everyone should not neglect his or 
her responsibility to overcome the crisis. Now is the time 
everyone should be aware of this.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Friday lodged a formal protest with the CNN (Cable 
News Network) of the United States against its "misleading and 
exaggerated" reports on the Korean situation in connection with 
the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  In the protest filed with the CNN's Seoul Bureau, the 
Information Ministry said the CNN was abetting the "theory of 
war crisis in Korea" through "misleading and exaggerated" 
reports on the reality of the Korean peninsula. 
  The ministry strongly asked the CNN to stop filing similarly 
exaggerated and misleading reports. 
  The protest said that the CNN, for instance, covered the 
routine civil defense drill of last June 15 in a way that made 
it appear as if the South Koreans were preparing for a war in 
earnest. 
  This was the first time the Seoul Government filed a formal 
protest with major American press media. 
  An observer said that such inflated reporting by the CNN 
apparently stemmed from their policy to make the Korean 
situation another opportunity to expand their influence. The 
CNN very profitably covered the Gulf war, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu Tuesday labeled nuclear weapons and the environment as 
critical issues for the world in the coming century. 
  Scientists widely believe that cultural evolution brought 
about material comfort and prosperity while also posing dangers 
to human existence, Han said in a speech at the international 
media conference on the environment and development. 
  "As we try to connect this view of natural science to that 
of 
social science, we will find that they match perfectly at this 
juncture, a juncture where the world is struggling to cope with 
the end of the Cold War and the conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round," said Han. 
  "The former has pushed forward the nuclear question, whereas 
the latter has catapulted the environmental question to the 
center stage," the foreign minister said. 
  "...The dual questions, nuclear weapons and the environment, 
have become critical issues for the world and especially for 
Korea, which also is arguably the most densely populated country 
in the world," said Han. 
  The foreign minister emphasized the need for regional 
cooperation in Northeast Asia, which is "characterized by a high 
population concentration and dynamic economic activity."

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States hold the 12th economic consultation in Washington 
June 22, when the two sides will adopt a one-year working-level 
report on progress in bilateral investment, trade, and 
industrial and technological cooperation, the Foreign Ministry 
announced Friday. 
  South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kon-u will lead the 
talks along with Joan Spero, U.S. undersecretary of state for 
economic affairs. 
  While tackling the usual agenda, Seoul officials said they 
will have to address further opening of the South Korean market 
to American cars. 
  "This time, we are in a position where we have to explain 
what we plan to do about this issue," a ministry official said. 
  The meeting will extend the South Korea-U.S. Dialogue for 
Economic Cooperation (DEC), launched in 1993, for one more year 
while adopting its report. 
  Bilateral issues include the auto market and a dispute over 
the expiration period for imported U.S. sausages. The overall 
agenda includes co-action at the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
officials said. 
  Pak, meanwhile, will speak on Seoul-Washington trade 
relations at luncheons with the Washington International Trade 
Association and the Korea Economic Institute of America.

  [Text] In connection with the fact that the ROK Government 
had recently decided that U.S.-made sausages were not 
appropriate for imports, the U.S. Trade Representative Office 
determined that there exists a secondary import barrier in the 
ROK for imports of agricultural products and began to listen to 
views on this issue from U.S. agricultural circles. The Trade 
Representative Office is likely to present these views to 
pressure the ROK Government at trade negotiations. 
  In the Federal Gazette dated 9 June, the U.S. Trade 
Representative Office asked "U.S. agricultural exporters to hand 
in their views on problems facing them with regard to the 77 
items of goods to which the ROK Government opened its markets in 
1989 by 8 July."

  [Text] Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui, protesting 
Washington's redesignation of Seoul in the Priority Watch List 
(PWL) for intellectual property rights (IPR) violations, 
yesterday vowed to stamp out offenders through continued 
inspections. 
  The government amended four IPR-related laws last year and 
enacted a new law protecting the semiconductor industry, Kim 
told the seventh session of the Korea-U.S. Business Council that 
opened for a two-day session. The opening ceremony was held at 
the Inter-Continental Hotel in southern Seoul. 
  "To strengthen IPR protection, our government basically aims 
at instituting a foundation against infringement by promulgating 
and revising relevant laws and regulations, by vigorously 
enforcing such laws nationwide until IPR infringements are 
completely eradicated, and by establishing greater public 
awareness of IPR protection," said the justice minister. 
  As a result of Seoul's tightened enforcement, the number of 
detected IPR violators was 2.2 times higher in 1993 than the 
previous year, he said. 
  "...We were disappointed to find that notwithstanding the 
(Korea-U.S. business) council's efforts, the American government 
has once again placed Korea on the PWL in its recent evaluation 
of the IPR protection of individual countries," he said. 
  Kim was one of the early speakers at the council session, 
divided into committees on manufacturing, technology and service 
and a subcommittee on IPR.

  [Text] It has been revealed that the inter-Korean trade is 
rapidly decreasing owing to the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy on 16 June said 
that inter-Korean trade during May was $12.551 million, a 
decrease of 35 percent over the same period last year. 
  The imports of North Korean goods into South Korea decreased 
by 42 percent to $10.882 million, and the South Korean exports 
of goods to North Korea increased by 230 percent to $1.669 
million. 
  Inter-Korean trade during the first five months of this year 
increased to $79.823 million, accounting for a 2.7 percent 
increase over the same period last year, of which the imports 
into South Korea were $70.938 million, a decrease of 5.6 percent. 
  A responsible official of the Trade, Industry, and Energy 
Ministry said, "The decrease in the inter-Korean trade is 
largely attributable to the aggravation of the North Korean 
nuclear issue and the North Korean shortage of foreign currency 
resulting from its economic difficulty." He added, "Local 
businesses are virtually suspending inter-Korean trade this 
month."

  [Text] North Korea announced a "decree" that, excluding 
"war-reserve rice," there would be no further reduction of food 
rations given residents for any reason whatsoever. 
  Published under the name of the Social Security Department 
and entitled, "On the State Not Burdening the People in Rations 
or Taxes [Kukkaeso Inmindurui Singnyangkwa Se Pudamul Haji Malde 
taehayo]," the gist of this decree was the complete denial of 
food-ration reductions at the central party level and the 
promise that, in the future, rations would not be reduced for 
any reason whatsoever. 
  According to the revelations of one diplomat of an Asian 
nation who had been stationed in Pyongyang, this decree was 
announced around May 1992 and its contents are as follows. 
  "The state has never reduced rations in an organized way. 
The 
state has only deducted 2 percent from rations. If there was 
anything deducted beyond that, it was done by some cadre in 
order to look good to the state. In the future, we will ensure 
that, excluding the natural reduction of 2 percent occurring in 
the process of transportation from farm to family, there will be 
no deductions made from rations for any reason whatsoever." 
  The DPRK's announcement of this decree of an end to 
food-ration deductions is understood to be a result of increased 
public dissatisfaction due to the reduction of food rations and 
of the public's occasional expression of resistance related to 
this, critical of the system. 
  Since about 1973, the DPRK has deducted as "war-reserve 
rice" 
a two-day portion (four-day portion per month) from the public's 
15-day food rations. Beginning in 1987, however, it has deducted 
an additional 10 percent from monthly rations, under the name 
"economization rice [Choryak Mi]." This lead to worsened food 
conditions. Beginning in 1990, the DPRK has actually been 
deducting 30 percent of food rations supplied, calling it 
"Patriotic Rice" and other names. 
  Beginning in late 1992 in particular, the DPRK Government, 
advocating a revival of self-sufficiency in each province, city, 
and county, instructed them to provide for their own food 
rations. Depending on the area, it cut off food rations three 
months each year and even moved from a two-meals-a-day to a 
one-meal-a-day campaign. 
  Because of this, saying "It's the same whether we starve to 
death or are caught for robbery and killed," the residents have 
been making group attacks on granaries, seizing rations. 
  One example of this was an occurrence reported to have taken 
place in September of last year in Kanggye-si, Chagang Province. 
Some workers unable to get their food rations secretly went 
into a granary and stole grain. When rumor of this spread to the 
whole city, its residents crowded into the granary as a group, 
looting it of food rations. 
  Meanwhile, even amid this food shortage and the 
dissatisfaction of its citizens, DPRK continues to store and 
conceal three years worth of food rations as war-reserve rice. 
  War-reserve rice is generally stored in three forms: 

  -  war-reserve rice for soldiers working in the forward area 
above the Demilitarized Zone is stored in underground tunnels in 
Cholwon, Kangwon Province and other areas; 
  -  reserve rice for 
other soldiers is stored in "No. 2 Warehouses" set up classified 
according to food-administration center in each province, 
municipality, and county; and 
  -  separate reserve rice is stored 
and concealed in major strategic zones planned to be attack and 
withdrawal areas. 

  War-reserve rice is replaced every year with new rice. Those 
stealing reserve rice are punished as ideological criminals, so 
there has been no loss due to this.

  [Excerpts] Seoul (NAEWOE TONGSIN)--The lexical definitions 
of the language used in North Korea provide bases for judging 
their political implications. In this sense, from any change in 
the definitions of religious words one may be able to detect a 
corresponding change in North Korea's religious policy. 
  In fact, Chosonmal Taesajon [The Korean Language Dictionary] 
published in April 1992 shows a striking difference from its 
older 1981 version published 10 years earlier, particularly in 
handling the religious vocabulary. The new version is a very 
comprehensive dictionary which took North Korea 7 years to 
compile and it has 330,000 entries in total. 
  North Korea claims that the new Chosonmal Taesajon, compiled 
by the Linguistics Research Institute under the North Korean 
Academy of Social Sciences and published by Sahoegwahak 
Chulpansa [Social Science Publishing House], covers an 
extensive vocabulary used for nearly 100 years since the 19th 
century, which has been researched comprehensively while using 
the original version published after liberation as a basis. 
North Korea has been stressing that the publication of the new 
dictionary marks a turning point as it spurs the chuche-based 
development of the Korean language; improvements in the 
people's speech; the education of party members and workers in 
the Korean- people-come-first principle; and an epochal 
development of science, education, and culture. 
  Accordingly, the fact that the definitions of religious 
expressions in the new language dictionary, which is of such 
great importance, show a marked departure from the old 
definitions is amazing in itself and indicates that North 
Korea's religious policy is undergoing a realistic change. 
  First, the most characteristic of all is that the previous 
negative or critical view of religion appearing in Hyondae 
Chosonmal Sajon [Modern Korean Language Dictionary] (published 
in 1981) and Cholhak Sajon [A Dictionary of Philosophy] 
(published in 1985) is eliminated by and large in the new 
Korean dictionary, which describes the development process of 
religion and religious thoughts in a more comprehensive and 
factual way. 
  North Korea's religious policy stems from the point of view 
of regarding religion as a form of superstition and a kind of 
opium that numbs the revolutionary spirit of the people. This 
attitude was fully reflected in the older Korean dictionary 
published in the 1980's. On the contrary, the newly published 
Chosonmal Taesajon does not equate religion with superstition 
but distinguishes between them. It distinguishes between 
religion and superstition by trying to describe religious 
phenomena in an objective manner while maintaining the old 
negative attitude toward superstition. This drastic change 
deserves attention, for it indicates that North Korea's view of 
religion has widened and become more objective since the late 
1980's. 
<H5>  Discriminating Between Religion, Superstition </H5>
  In Hyondae Chosonmal Sajon published in 1981 defines 
religion 
as "a reactionary outlook on the world or the belief that 
preaches how to dream of a happy life in the other world." On 
the contrary, Chosonmal Taesajon defines religion as "the 
outlook on the world based on a doctrine that preaches an 
absolute faith or belief in the super natural and superhuman 
being." In addition, the new dictionary strikes out the 
traditional critical descriptions invariably found in the older 
versions, such as: "a tool of oppression and exploitation"; 
"the imperialists' ideological tool for invading backward 
countries"; "the opium used in dulling the revolutionary 
awareness of the masses and inspiring in them the principle of 
nonresistance so that they may unconditionally subject 
themselves to exploitation and oppression." Instead the new 
dictionary explains religion in more concrete terms, using 
expressions such as: "believing the holy being such as God or 
the Lord"; and "there are numerous religions and religious 
sects, large and small, beginning with the primitive religions 
and including Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam." 
  This change in the attitude of North Korea was reflected in 
the booklet titled "Ruminating About the History of the Great 
Love" published in 1989. The piece, authored by Ho Chong-suk, 
chairwoman of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the 
Fatherland, contains an article titled "Let Us Treasure the 
Patriotism of a Female Teacher." In this article Ho Chong-suk 
tells an anecdote about An Sin-ho, An Chang-ho's younger 
sister, who was so moved by Kim Il-song's warmheartedness that 
she came to devote herself to the task of nation building and 
worked hard for Kim Il-song. The article quotes Kim Il- song as 
saying: "Without regard to what religion she believes in, we 
should first try to see the depth of her patriotism and the 
intensity of her efforts for nation building. We should not 
take a jaundiced view of, or discriminate against her by 
keeping her at an arm's length simply because she is a 
religious woman." 
<H5>  "Negative Explanations" of Doctrines Omitted </H5>
  Chosonmal Taesajon also makes a lot of changes in its 
explanations of religious doctrines as is the case with 
religious phenomena. The older version explains theology as an 
unscientific branch of learning that tries to rationalize 
religious doctrines on the basis of an idealist outlook on the 
world. But the new version simply explains that theology is "a 
branch of learning for studying the religious doctrines on 
God," and in the definition of theological terminology, it omits 
the old negative and biased explanations. For instance, in the 
entry under "religious education" the older version defines it 
as "a reactionary and unscientific education designed to 
inspire religious doctrines in the heart of the people," but 
the new version corrects that definition by simply saying that 
it is "an education for teaching religious doctrines and 
precepts." 
  On Buddhism the older version of the Korean language 
dictionary presents a negative view that Buddhism preaches a 
reactionary thought of slavish submission and the principle of 
nonresistance. It criticizes Buddhism for trying to dull the 
class consciousness and fighting spirit of the masses and 
having a dire deleterious effect on the development of culture 
and science. But the newly published Chosonmal Taesajon omits 
all such negative explanations and criticisms and describes 
Buddhism as one of the three major religions widespread in the 
East while giving a detailed explanation of the origin, 
development, and central thought of Buddhism. 
  Christianity has been seen in the most unfavorable light in 
North Korean philosophy and history textbooks in the past. In 
the older dictionaries it is pointed out that Christianity was 
being used as a tool of imperialist aggression and was perusing 
the U.S. policy of aggression in South Korea. But in Chosonmal 
Taesajon such criticisms are omitted and instead it presents a 
richer substance and more factual explanations about 
Christianity than Korean dictionaries in South Korea. 
<H5>  Abundant Religious Vocabulary </H5>
  On Confucianism North Korea used to take a critical view of 
it by lumping the feudal Confucian thinking and Confucianism 
together as a thought or doctrine that was used as a tool for 
maintaining the conservative and reactionary feudal ruling 
structures, without distinguishing between the two. On the 
contrary, Chosonmal Taesajon, omitting all negative expressions 
regarding Confucianism, presents a conceptual definition of 
Confucianism in these words: "Confucianism is a political and 
ethical doctrine that has been maintained in China for many 
many years." It also presents a detailed account of the 
development process of Confucianism. The dictionary simply says 
that Confucianism has had an immense influence upon our country 
in various aspects of our social life since it was brought in, 
without passing any judgment on this influence. 
  Chosonmal Taesajon has an additional vocabulary of 200,000 
words in excess of the 130,000 words entered in Hyondae 
Chosonmal Sajon. Its religious vocabulary is correspondingly 
larger and richer. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Religion Used as Window for Opening </H5>
  Chosonmal Taesajon has new entries for the Tenriism of 
Japan, 
the Hinduism and Brahmanism of India, and the Taoism of China, 
and presents factual descriptions of them. It also describes 
Allah, the Korean, and Islam accurately and in detail in a 
factual way. 
  All this is clear proof that unlike its older version, 
Chosonmal Taesajon tries to explain all religions, religious 
doctrines, and scriptures without omitting any and that its 
compilers tried hard to faithfully present an objective 
description of religious phenomena by doing away with the 
previous negative attitude toward religion itself. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the occasion of publishing Chosonmal Taesajon, North 
Korea 
showed an epoch-making change by presenting a more positive 
definition of the religious vocabulary and at the same time 
amended its constitution clearly stipulating that it is 
permissible to hold religious rituals and set up facilities of 
worship. These changes happened in April 1992. However, since 
then no signs have been found yet which show that North Korea's 
religious policy has undergone a corresponding revision to back 
up these changes. The reason is that in North Korea religion is 
not reviving in the form of reinstatement of the self-generating 
religious substructures, but still remains at the level of 
being used by North Korea as a window through which it may try 
to give glimpses of its attempt at opening its economy to the 
outside world after the Chinese model. Moreover, beginning in 
the 1980's North Korea tried at a policy level to train the 
priesthood that would revive the desiccated religions. Even if 
religion is to revive in North Korea, this process will hardly 
elevate religion beyond the limit of being a state religion 
that depends on the priesthood trained under a state policy. 
That is why North Korea may well be concentrating more on 
sprucing up its religious appearances by retouching the 
religious vocabulary and enacting laws and regulations related 
to religion with a view to shutting off outside influence as 
much as possible and thereby demonstrating its independent 
capabilities.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- A meeting of relevant 
government officials on Tuesday decided to step up control of 
illegal fishing by South Korean fishermen in the Japanese waters. 
  A source at the fisheries administration said that thanks to 
steady control, only 18 cases of illegal fishing in the Japanese 
waters were uncovered in the first four months of this year. 
  The number compares with 374 cases in the corresponding 
period of last year. 
  The source said Tuesday's decision came as illegal fishing 
is 
feared to swell in the Japanese waters in the high fishery 
season of June through August. 
  Under the intensified control, the maritime police will 
assign more patrol boats to potential illegal fishing yards and 
will pursue and catch all boats involved, the source added.

<F P=106> [By reporter Song Mun-hong] </F>
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue became a focus of 
world attention when Pyongyang declared its withdrawal from the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on 12 March last year, only 15 
days after the start of the Kim Yong-sam government. More than a 
year has passed since then, but the issue remains unresolved and 
no light is seen at the end of the long, long tunnel. The 
nuclear issue is proving to be an increasingly heavy burden on 
the new government committed to a civilian age. 
  The discontent of the people is also on the rise amid the 
battles procrastinating between North and South Korea and 
between North Korea and the international community. There have 
been frictions between hard-liners and moderates, confusion 
between ministries and agencies, and conflicting remarks by the 
president. Public criticisms have intensified, both in range and 
tone. 
  In an interview with this reporter, Chong Chong-uk, the 
senior presidential secretary for foreign policy and national 
security, who was one of the "quartette of scholars" in the 
first cabinet of the new government, first referred to the 
criticisms and said that "as one of the government officials 
responsible, I feel sorry for the people that the nuclear issue 
is still unresolved." 
  The interview was held in Chong's Chongwadae office on 9 
April, the very next day of the first session held by the 
Security Policy Coordinating Council, a new organ for 
adjustments on policies relating to the nuclear issue, which the 
government created to cope with mounting criticisms by media 
over controversial remarks made by officials one after another 
since late March--including those by Ambassador Hwang Pyong-tae 
and Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong. 
  [Song Mun-hong] There has been strong criticism against our 
government's policy concerning the North Korean nuclear issue in 
the past year. Especially, many people point to the fact that 
differences between the advocates of dialogue and the 
hard-liners remain unresolved. 
  [Chong Chong-uk] "I am hoping that our people will 
understand 
these points: First, the government is holding on to its 
position seeking a peaceful settlement on the issue. 
  "Second, it is, essentially, an issue difficult to resolve 
by 
our independent will and capability alone. While an issue 
between North and South Korea, it is also an international 
issue. It is a dual issue in nature. Therefore, it requires 
exploring for a settlement through two axes. 
  "Under the present circumstances, a North-South mutual 
inspection through dialogue is a dead plan, while our 
discretionary power under international cooperation system is, 
inevitably, a very much limited one. 
  "Hence, it has been unavoidable, I think, that the 
government 
appeared to be shifting between a pro-dialogue course and a 
tough line depending on whether the nuclear issue was in a good 
or in a strained situation. In other words, I would like to 
point out that it all reflects the fundamental nature of the 
issue, not any deficiencies in the diplomatic ability of the 
government. 
  "Another point is that the people have been extremely 
sensitive to the nuclear issue. They were very sensitive to 
developments as the issue was taken to the UN Security Council 
following North Korea's rejection of the IAEA inspection. 
Accordingly, the government cannot but be extremely cautious not 
to cause uneasiness among them." 
  Chong Chong-uk disclosed that the new government had set out 
with a policy concept on North Korea that was quite innovative. 
It was based on that concept, he said, that President Kim 
declared in his inauguration speech that "no alliance can 
supersede the interests of the nation." The senior Chongwadae 
secretary explained that the president's statement reflected his 
ambition to free the nation from an alliance based on its Cold 
War-era posture toward North Korea and the anticommunist 
ideology and to establish a new relationship worthy of the 
post-Cold War era. The progressive posture, however, faced a 
setback when North Korea declared its withdrawal from the NPT, 
he said. 
  [Song] With regard to its responses in the past year, there 
have been widespread complaints that our government was shunned 
in negotiations with the United States and that it kept making 
concessions to North Korean demands. Is the government now 
prepared to take a firmer position? 
  [Chong] "My view is that it is neither necessary nor 
desirable to keep up with the so-called brinkmanship diplomacy 
of North Korea. Should we respond with our version of 
brinkmanship, we will have to follow carefully-thought-out 
tactics to keep us from falling off the precipice together. If 
North Korea had really been prepared to go to war, it would not 
have even mentioned the word war, never. So, I see the recent 
`Seoul in a sea of fire' remark by the North Korean delegate [at 
Panmunjom] as part of a shrewd psychological tactic against our 
people." 
  [Song] A series of comments on North Korea by President Kim 
Yong-sam have caused repercussions. Some even accused Chongwadae 
secretaries of failing to properly assist the president. 
  [Chong] "The reportedly controversial comments were quoted 
out of context, I believe. For instance, a careful study of the 
context about the sentence 'we cannot shake hands with those who 
possess nuclear weapons indicates that the president never meant 
to say that he will hold no dialogue with North Korea. He meant 
to say that the North Korean nuclear issue is so important that 
an era of coexistence and co-prosperity can come only when it 
has been resolved. The expression he used was intended to 
emphasize his position that gives top priority to national 
security, not to say that North Korea has nuclear weapons or 
that there will be no meetings with it until the nuclear issue 
has been resolved. 
  "The same thing can be said about the president's 25 
February 
remark that `a summit is possible if it is to help achieve a 
settlement on the nuclear issue.' An exchange of special envoys 
was first proposed by the North Korean side. The proposal that 
all North-South problems, including the nuclear issue, be 
discussed and settled at a summit also came from the North 
Korean side, did it not? When the president made the remark at 
issue, both sides had agreed on working-level contacts for an 
exchange of special envoys; under such circumstances, the 
president meant to say that `there isnothing I wouldn't do if it 
was for achieving settlement on the nuclear issue.' 
  "Media overinterpreted the president's comments, claiming 
that he made contradictory remarks, thus deliberately distorting 
the president's original intent." 
  [Song] We even hear criticism that the president has no 
basic 
understanding of the nuclear issue. 
  [Chong] "It is a grave misunderstanding about the president. 
Needless to say, the nuclear issue has technically complicated 
aspects. Speaking for myself, although I have been absorbed in 
this issue almost daily since the start of the new government, 
there still are many things I am unable to understand. The 
president bears overall responsibility for state affairs, and I 
don't think he needs to be familiar with specific, technical 
details. And when I brief him of the nuclear issue, I do not 
include such details. 
  "For what the nuclear issue means politically, and for 
things 
a supreme leader should know about the nuclear issue, the 
president has perfect understanding. He usually uses the kind of 
expression that does not resort to a logical way of explanation 
on this or that. While thinking very deeply, he expresses the 
thought in sentences short but full of implications. That is his 
style. 
  "As a result, when such implicative thoughts are delivered 
in 
general terms, the public may have difficulty in correctly 
grasping the meaning, I think. I am not saying this to defend 
the president as a senior secretary for him. But I must say that 
what I have been feeling about the president briefing him on 
developments in the nuclear issue over a year is considerably 
different from reports in media. The North Korean nuclear issue 
is the most important of all issues. How could the president be 
unconcerned about it?" 
  [Song] A look at developments in our nuclear policy 
indicates 
that there often were differences and confrontations between 
ministries and agencies concerned. Also, we hear criticisms that 
in the system of cooperation with the United States, the roles 
of the two sides are not properly defined. It is also said that 
U.S. officials have a complaint that they cannot make out what 
the Korean government's nuclear policy is all about. 
  [Chong] "With respect to responses to the nuclear issue, 
there are differences among U.S. authorities, too. It is a fact, 
of course, that within our government, there are some 
differences in views between ministries and agencies. It would 
be rather unrealistic and unnatural, I think, if all the 
ministries and agencies concerned should come up with an 
identical view about the nuclear issue. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs takes the position seeking a diplomatic settlement while 
the National Unification Board gives priority to North-South 
relations. At the same time, the Ministry of National Defense 
and the Agency for National Security Planning have their 
respective views. 
  "Eventually, under the presidential system, the president 
decides the direction of national policy based on his 
comprehensive judgment. Inter-ministry differences are put 
through this inner coordinating process, which, when viewed from 
outside, might appear to be a wavering between hard-line and 
moderate approaches. This has something to do with what I 
mentioned earlier--our limitations within the international 
community and the fundamental nature of the nuclear issue. Let 
me emphasize that there is absolutely no such thing as the 
inter-ministry differences which directly lead to policy 
confusion. 
  "One more thing. I know the fact that a small number of 
Americans are saying that they `cannot make out what the Korean 
policy is all about.' As for us, we must, in dealing with the 
nuclear issue, display tactical flexibility while holding on to 
our principles firmly. This process inevitably involves 
dilemmas. When efforts for a through-dialogue settlement fail to 
produce results, causing tension and a sense of crisis in the 
Korean Peninsula, we are forced to take the position of putting 
the brake on the international community, the United States in 
particular. From the U.S. point of view, it could appear that 
Korea often takes a hard-line approach but--when the United 
States actually tries to take a tough stand -- puts a curb on 
it." 
  [Song] The North Korean nuclear issue can be viewed from two 
separate angles: the special inspection to ascertain the lack 
of transparency of North Korean nuclear activities prior to the 
IAEA inspection of May 1992, and the temporary, general 
inspection for the continuity of nuclear safeguards thereafter. 
Also, when the North Korean nuclear issue is viewed from another 
two points of view--namely, the issue being used by North Korea 
as a trump card and as a tactic to gain time for actual 
development of nuclear weapons--we can assume that the situation 
becomes more unfavorable for us as time passes by. 
  Also, the atmosphere in the United States is showing a 
subtle 
change, according to many scholars. From the U.S. point of view, 
the issue is critical more for the importance it attaches to the 
preservation of a global NPT system than for the stability on 
the Korean Peninsula. 
  Meanwhile, arguments that the United States will be 
compelled 
to tolerate one to three nuclear bombs which North Korea may 
already have are gaining ground both in and out of the U.S. 
government. The quarterly journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS carried an 
article even calling for U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea. The 
point is that U.S. troops should not be left on the Korean 
Peninsula, a danger zone, at a time when North Korea apparently 
has nuclear weapons. Is our government prepared to deal with 
these problems? 
  [Chong] "You are saying that the present situation remains 
unchanged from a year ago or even shows deteriorations. As I 
said earlier, our influence in the international community is a 
limited one; nevertheless, we achieved IAEA inspections, 
intermittent though, in the past year, paving the way for an 
assessment of North Korea's nuclear development to some degrees. 
I would like to count it as an achievement if it can be called 
that. 
  "Second, regarding the question of whether North Korea now 
has nuclear weapons, and whether the possibility of North Korea 
having developed nuclear weapons has increased now that a long 
time has passed since its withdrawal from the NPT in March 1993 
or since May 1992...so far, no one in any country in the world 
has produced firm evidence of North Korea's possession of 
nuclear weapons. While media have carried a wide range of 
conflicting speculations, the government has confirmed that at 
present there is no specific, irrefutable evidence that North 
Korea has nuclear weapons. 
  "Third, with respect to your question if the U.S. policy is 
shifting from halting North Korea's nuclear program to imposing 
a freeze on it at the present level, my answer is that it is 
not. A careful study of opinions recently voiced in the United 
States indicates that no one has ever said that the United 
States would tolerate North Korea's possession of nuclear 
weapons. 
  "In its current position, the United States divides its 
policy goal into two phases, striving for a settlement by stage. 
Efforts for accurate information on North Korean nuclear 
activities through temporary inspections and for a freeze on 
them represent the first phase, while realization of special 
inspections to secure the transparency of North Korean nuclear 
activities prior to May 1992 constitute its second phase. These 
are the goals of the two nations, Korea and the United States. 
It is not intended to abandon special inspections after all." 
  [Song] Some specialists say that if North Korea conceals its 
nuclear weapons, it is impossible to uncover them even through 
special inspections and North-South mutual inspections, and that 
therefore, it is a matter of political judgement on the part of 
the president to secure complete transparency on North Korean 
nuclear weapons. 
  "It is not so. If special inspections and North-South mutual 
inspections are carried out, accurate data can be obtained on 
North Korean nuclear activities in the past. Special inspections 
will produce accurate figures on the quantities of nuclear 
material which North Korea extracted in the past by operating 
its reprocessing facilities. The mission of the IAEA is to 
ensure that nuclear activities are not diverted for military 
purposes; therefore, if inspections produce evidence of such 
diversion, it is to lead to another round of discussion. 
  "Furthermore, there is the Joint Statement of 
Denuclearization in effect between North and South Korea, which 
precludes not only the possession of reprocessing facilities and 
enriched uranium but also the deployment, manufacturing and 
possession of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula. If North 
Korea has nuclear weapons, we can demand their dismantling under 
this joint statement." 
  [Song] But it is still possible that Pyongyang conceals its 
nuclear weapons somewhere in North Korea, is it not? 
  [Chong] "In that case, there is legal basis for the IAEA and 
our government to make an effort to find them. If another 
problem arises after the transparency has been secured on North 
Korean nuclear weapons, it shall be discussed then. In the 
present stage, I do not think it is a right approach to the 
issue to abandon our current efforts by saying that `North Korea 
may already have nuclear weapons.' 
  "What we need now is to find out how much weapon-worth 
material North Korea has secured through its nuclear activities 
in the past. At present, our problem is that we are not only 
unaware of all the facts about North Korea's past activities but 
also unable to shut off its possibility of continuing nuclear 
activities in the future." 
  [Song] The Security Policy Coordinating Council held its 
first meeting yesterday. The creation of the new council, on one 
hand, appears to be a show of the president's will to control 
discords among ministries and agencies as reported; on the 
other, however, it overlaps the existing councils that make 
decisions concerning the nuclear issue. Some say that it is like 
adding a fifth wheel to a coach. 
  [Chong] "There were four similar councils established 
earlier--the National Security Council, the Council of 
Unification-Related Ministers, the High-Level Strategy Council, 
and the Council of Security-Related Ministers. The National 
Security Council is a constitutional organ, which seldom met in 
the past. The Council of Unification-Related Ministers meets 
about once a month on nuclear- and unification-related issues, 
presided over by the deputy prime minister for unification 
affairs. It is deficient in promptness and effectiveness. The 
High-Level Strategy Council was originally created to prepare 
strategy for the North-South High-Level Talks, which are prime 
minister-level contacts. Although media reported that this 
council met frequently in the past, the sessions were quite 
irregular. 
  "Finally, the Council of Security-Related Ministers, chaired 
by the president, has its problems because it is realistically 
difficult for the president to have a hand in working-level 
business. Thus, it is not very effective in dealing with issues 
requiring quick responses. 
  "I understand that those were the reasons why the Security 
Policy Coordinating Council was created recently by a 
presidential directive. The new council meets every week. It is 
for the heads of offices concerned with the nuclear issue--the 
deputy prime minister for unification affairs, the minister of 
foreign affairs, the minister of national defense, the director 
of the Agency for National Security Planning, the Chongwadae 
secretary general, and the senior presidential secretary for 
foreign policy and national security--to meet regularly for more 
prompt responses." 
  Since its inauguration, the Kim Yong-sam government has 
apologized to the people five times altogether, including three 
times in connection with the opening of the nation's rice 
market. Should it fail to resolve the nuclear issue 
satisfactorily, however, no amount of apology would suffice. It 
is because the nuclear issue is directly linked to the destiny 
of our 40 million people and, further, that of the entire Korean 
nation. 
  Senior Presidential Secretary Chong Chong-uk said that the 
government is "doing everything in its power" to get the nuclear 
issue resolved. In fact, however, the government has so far been 
merely absorbed in confrontations and frictions, giving no such 
impression as that it is "doing everything in its power." Only 
when it proves to the people that it is "doing everything in its 
power" will the Kim Yong-sam government perhaps be able to come 
out of the prolonged "North Korean nuclear issue" tunnel.

former U.S. President Carter's visit to North Korea. 
  Regarding this, the U.S. Embassy said that it would convey 
his desire to meet with former President Carter, and asked if Yi 
thinks that Kim Tae-chung, president of the Peace Foundation for 
the Asia-Pacific Region [and former head of the Democratic

  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- The domestic political 
situation took a turn for the worse Monday when the opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) decided to force a showdown with the 
ruling party over the suspended parliamentary investigation of 
the Sangmudae scandal. 
  At a meeting of its supreme council on Monday, the DP 
decided 
to take strong action against the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party and the government which, it said, have been balking at 
the parliamentary probe. 
  Spurred by an opposition demand, the National Assembly had 
invoked its parliamentary right to probe the Sangmudae scam. 
  The opposition party claims that the president of a 
construction company, Cho Ki-hyon, created a slush fund out of 
profits he made from a defense contract to move a facility 
called Sangmudae in Kwangju to the city's outskirts. 
  The DP alleges that part of the fund was eventually 
funnelled 
into the ruling party during the 1992 presidential election. In 
calling for the probe, the opposition party wanted the National 
Assembly to find out the truth behind the allegations. 
  As a result of Monday's decision, the DP plans to take its 
case directly to the people by having newspapers publish the 
facts uncovered so far by the parliamentary investigation and 
details of the DP's own probe, as well as records of the 
prosecution's investigation obtained by the party. 
  The opposition party also decided to sue Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, Kim Chong-ku, chief of the Seoul District 
Prosecutor's Office, Sin Song-taek, chief judge of the Seoul 
Criminal District Court, and managers and other officials at 10 
branch offices of six banks who refused to release to opposition 
lawmakers the deposit records of people involved in the alleged 
scandal. 
  In addition, the party will push for the impeachment of 
Defense Minister Yi, Chief Judge Sin and Justice Minister Kim 
Tu-hui. 
  As for impeaching President Kim Yong-sam, the DP will 
withhold a decision because initiation of the procedure requires 
the signatures of more than half the National Assembly 
representatives.

<F P=106> [By senior political reporter Kim Chong-nae] </F>
  [Text] Having gone through a crisis over the "replacement 
of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the handling of the approval 
of Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok's appointment," the relationship 
between the ruling and opposition parties is expected to bring 
tremendous changes to the political world. 
  "Tremendous changes" means that the relationship between the 
ruling and opposition parties formed since the birth of the new 
government will be shaken to its roots. It appears that this 
change will create great waves within the ruling and opposition 
parties and will become a new compass by which the direction of 
the political situation is determined. 
  Symptoms of the change in the relationship between the 
ruling 
and opposition parties appeared in the negotiations on and 
handling of the approval of the appointment of Prime Minister 
Yi, which went through a repeated game of hide-and-seek: full 
confrontation--narrowing of opinions--rupture of negotiations. 
  A surface change in the relationship between the ruling and 
opposition parties is that their mutual images have changed. The 
ruling party may want to deny it, but it is a change deeply felt 
by all in political circles. Only a year ago, when the new 
administration was born, the opposition party disappeared from 
the political stage. An extreme expression would be that only 
President Kim Yong-sam got the spotlight. It was hard to see or 
hear anything of the opposition party. It ran about in 
confusion, without even knowing where to stand in the whirlwind 
of reform and the anticorruption drive. A so-called "identity 
crisis" heavily burdened the minds of the opposition. Now, 
however, they are undeniably the star of the stage. Achieving 
symmetry with the Kim administration, they have returned in the 
form of a "new opposition," having clearly secured a space for 
opposing the present administration. 
  The advent of the "new opposition" signifies that the ruling 
party has lost part of its right to manage the political 
situation." It is now actually impossible to direct the 
political situation according to the purposes and plans of only 
the ruling party, as it had done in the past. 
  An internal change in the relationship between the ruling 
and 
opposition parties is that their perceptions of each other have 
changed. The present ruling and opposition parties have the same 
roots; they came out of the opposition of an era of 
authoritarian regimes. All one has to do is think of the old New 
Democratic Party [Ku Sinmindang] and the Council for the 
Promotion of Democracy [Minchuhyop]. Although divided into 
ruling and opposition parties, they shared a common denominator 
of antidictatorial, anti-military-regime emotion. Now, however, 
they have entered into a completely hostile, competitive 
relationship. Having become no different than the relationship 
between the ruling and opposition parties of the past, hatred 
and disregard have accumulated about as much as is possible. At 
one time applauding the president's reform so much as to shame 
the vested forces of the ruling party and calling for the 
strengthening of national competitiveness as if competing with 
it, the opposition has now entered an attack phase, saying it is 
"the president's form of rule and consciousness which should be 
the objects of reform." 
  This change in the relationship between the ruling and 
opposition parties is a key for predicting the future of the 
political situation. The importance of this change can be felt 
more intensely when reflection is made upon its background and 
causes. 
  Most carefully to be considered of the factors behind this 
change is that it was not a result of the spontaneous choice of 
the political world. The change was neither agreed upon nor even 
based on a tacit understanding between the ruling party and the 
opposition. Rather, external conditions and structural factors 
of the political world brought change. Inasmuch as it was not a 
spontaneous choice, it is difficult to gauge the influence 
accompanying this change. If it had been a choice in which the 
will and preferences of the political world had functioned, it 
would be easy for the political world itself to control the 
direction and breadth of the change. The situation, however, was 
just the opposite. Korea's political climate, used to 
considering moral justifications important and to confrontation 
between camps, makes it more difficult to control change. 
  Factors outside the political arena pressing for change 
include not only various domestic, environmental and other 
outstanding issues, but also international factors as well, such 
as the Uruguay Round. As for opposition to the ratification of 
the Uruguay Round Final Performance Plan, it became an 
opportunity for reviving the practically-exhausted opposition 
party. Of course, there have been issues, such as the Uruguay 
agreement, difficult for the political world to endure, but it 
is hard to deny that other blunders of the ruling party played a 
big part in getting the opposition back on its feet. 
  Circumstances inside the ruling and opposition parties will 
be different, but a structural factor of the political world 
accelerating change was the leadership of the minority faction. 
The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] has been led by the minority 
Democratic-Party [DP] faction. Apart from an objective 
evaluation, one got a sense that the minority's control of the 
political situation was insufficient to effectively lead the 
majority, the Democratic-Justice-Party [DJP] and 
Republican-Party [RP] factions, at least as far as the front 
against the opposition party is concerned. Most really feel 
that the passive posture of the DJP and RP factions caused a 
loss of the DLP's power to deal with the minority faction within 
the National Assembly. 
  Party President Yi Ki-taek, belonging to the minority 
faction 
in the DP, has lead the opposition party. Although the largest 
faction, the Tonggyo-tong faction, supports President Yi, there 
cannot help but be a difference between this and the 
Tonggyo-tong faction exercising direct management of the party. 
More important is the fact that the Tonggyo-tong faction's 
support for President Yi has varied according to the situation 
and issues under consideration. What has caused this gap to 
widen is the system of collective leadership called the Chief 
Executives Council. As it is a collective leadership system, it 
is very possible for it to lean toward the selection of an 
inconsistent, hard party line toward the ruling party based on 
vividness, rather than one which is realistic and flexible. 
  Butting heads as a result of thus overlapping factors both 
inside and outside the political arena, in one fell swoop the 
ruling and opposition parties raised to the ceiling the 
intensity of their attack and defense. With the traditional 
course of problems posed and counter attacks launched generally 
abbreviated, the situation got hot in the blink of an eye. 
  The opposition naturally attempted to make changes. They 
seemed intent on redeeming in a day the silence they have kept 
up to now. 
  As was seen in the exposure of the Sangmudae scandal, the 
opposition made an all-out attack on the ethics of the present 
administration, as if going for its Achilles Heel. The 
administration had advocated reform as though it had a patent on 
it. In a special press interview on 2 May, DP President Yi 
Ki-taek, taking aim directly at the president, demanded he 
explain the Sangmudae scandal. The ruling party ignored and 
disregarded this. 
  Meanwhile, teamwork broke down within the ruling party. It 
was the Kim Hoe-chang crisis. As the ruling party became the 
object of the scrutiny of public opinion, and of the stinging 
scrutiny of the middle class in particular, it hastened to bring 
the situation under control, but it was too late. The crisis had 
already worsened. 
  In this state, both the ruling party and opposition both did 
their best to control the crisis in a manner benefiting 
themselves. This made conflict between the two more intense. The 
DP brought up the president's closest aides, criticizing them; 
the DLP officially presented the idea that Asia-Pacific Peace 
Foundation Director Kim Tae-chung was interfering in politics. 
Although this was not a full mobilization of the means of attack 
from which the two had been refraining, it was the first use of 
subjects which till now had been considered taboo. 
  Looking back over such circumstances, it appears the change 
which has started to show itself in the relationship between the 
ruling and opposition parties will become greatly accelerated. 
Particularly, it appears that, as long as there is no change in 
the situation, the fight for leadership of the political 
situation will grow much fiercer and that this will be the 
epicenter of the accelerating change in the relationship between 
the ruling and opposition parties. Looking at it by their time 
table, in the short term, prospects are that the ruling and 
opposition parties will clash severely over invoking the right 
of parliamentary investigation into the Sangmudae scandal, house 
composition of the National Assembly which must be completed 
within six months, National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay 
Round, and disposal of the budget for the new year in the 
regular session of the National Assembly. 
  Of these, the UR ratification cannot be omitted, so it is 
clear that it will be a battle from which neither side can 
withdraw. 
  However, avoiding an open confrontation in the National 
Assembly, etc., the possibility the ruling and opposition 
parties will enter a full-scale propaganda battle for securing a 
support base and for taking control of the overall situation 
cannot be excluded. For example, the ruling party, completely 
ignoring the opposition, will carry out national affairs 
directed toward the public and will strongly pursue a policy of 
reform and of strengthening national competitiveness; the 
opposition may strengthen its out-of-parliament attack on the 
ethics of the ruling party. If this happens, the battle in the 
National Assembly will deteriorate into one line of 
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties. 
  No matter what their side, within the minds of those in the 
clashing ruling and opposition parties will always be drawn a 
picture of the local autonomy system, [the election for which 
will be held] in less than a year (June of next year). Strategic 
and tactical concern about from what position and in what mode 
they should carry out the local elections will regulate the 
actions of the ruling and opposition parties. 
  This may be premature, but the results of next year's local 
elections will be a decisive variable by which to judge the 
composition of the management of the political situation in the 
latter half of the ruling party's time in power. In the 
opposition party too, it will become a chance for an outline to 
come into focus of the direction of the party leadership and of 
the battle for the party candidacy for the next presidential 
election.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yi Yon-hong and Kim Min-pae: "Selections Break </F>
New Ground,' Feature Reformist Personages in Their Forties: 
Inside and Outside of DLP Appointments of New Chief Organizers"] 
  [Text] Reshuffles began in the ruling camp as the 
Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] yesterday appointed new chief 
organizers for 10 of the opposition-dominated districts. In a 
nutshell, the announced selections broke new ground. Nine out of 
the 10 appointees are from non-political circles. Professional 
politicians are shut out, conspicuously; the appointees include 
four ex-government officials, three lawyers, a scholar and a 
chaeya [reformist camp] figure from an activist 
group. No familiar faces, and not many celebrities in their 
sectors either. Their average age is 49, 6 years younger than 
the average of the present DLP district chairmen, which is 55. 
They belong to no factions. There is no to-the-core RDP [former 
Reunification Democratic Party] man among them, and none 
affiliated with the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] 
faction either. Of the 10, the only professional politician is 
Rep. Cho Yong-chik, nominated for Songpa-B, Seoul. A member of 
the NDRP (former New Democratic Republican Party) faction, he is 
an exceptional case. 
  The action literally demonstrates a "shift in generation" 
and 
a "shake-up." Its timing proves it. The ruling camp had kept 
putting off the appointments for as long as 5 months, each time 
by instructions from Chongwadae awaiting the passage of the 
Political Reform Act through the National Assembly. Finally, the 
reform act was passed, setting the stage for the next step, the 
human reform. 
<H5>  Average Age 49, Unaffiliated </H5>
  The DLP has served notice that the same principles will be 
followed in the nominations for the rest of similar districts, 
too. It appears very likely that they will be carried through 
into the party endorsement process for candidates in the 14th 
general election. After the district-level reshuffles will come 
a national-level shake-up. It is the time for those 
"influential" incumbents in the National Assembly to worry about 
their individual cases of "endorsement." 
  Meanwhile, some within the ruling camp strongly reacted 
against the new party line, particularly members of the DJP 
faction, who see it as targeted on them. 
<H5>  Picks on "Kim Mun-su's Record" </H5>
  Complaints were voiced bluntly at a party executives meeting 
held on 8 March. Executive Committee member Yi Chi-ho, DJP, 
fired the first bullet, taking issue with the personal record of 
Kim Mun-su, appointed to the post of Puchon Sosa District, 
Kyonggi Province. Kim Mun-su had served 2 years and 6 months in 
prison for leading the 3 May Inchon Upheaval, a key battle in 
the 1986 constitutional amendment struggle for direct 
presidential election system. He was convicted on charges of 
violating the National Security Law. 
  "Since when has a criminal record been viewed as a credit?" 
asked Yi Chi-ho at the session. He raised questions over Kim 
Mun-su's rehabilitation and his role in the Chonnohyop [National 
Council of Labor Movements]. Secretary General Mun Chong-su 
responded, only in theoretical terms. 
  Where the DJP faction is headed with its resistance is a 
matter of concern. It is hardly predictable at the moment, 
however. The party leadership seems to take a wait-and-see 
attitude. Meanwhile, complaints seem to grow deeper inwardly as 
time goes by. 
<H5>  For Showdown with the Opposition </H5>
  The DJP faction had shown some wayward signs until recently, 
which, however, have subsided since the party decided to 
postpone its national convention, a development that deprived 
the faction of its pretext for agitation. Now, one may say that 
it is about to find a new pretext. 
  Meanwhile, it is known that the process of selecting the new 
district-level chief organizers was plagued with backbiting 
mirroring that situation. It is said that most difficult were 
the decisions on Seoul and Puchon districts. It was because the 
opposition maintains an edge in those districts. In the process 
of coordinating with Chongwadae on final selections under the 
lead of Secretary General Mun Chong-su and Kang Sam-chae, 
director of the Basic Research Office, officials reportedly 
weighed that fact and decided to bring in reform-oriented, 
untainted "new faces" in force for a showdown with the 
opposition. 
<H5>  Local Tendencies Taken into Account </H5>
  Thus came the appointment of Chong Song-chol, a lawyer from 
chaeya and presently assistant first minister of 
state, for Kangnam-B, Seoul, and that of Kim Hak-won, also a 
lawyer and political new face, for Songdong-B, Seoul. The two 
satisfied the newly adopted standards, it was explained. Chong 
Song-chol -- who is a drawing-card-type chaeya 
figure, whose participation in the new government was the result 
of "recommendation" by Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong -- had been 
designated for the post early on, although informally. 
  The selection of Kim Mun-su "fueled criticism" through to 
the 
end. The reason was that he was the leader in the 3 May, 1986, 
Inchon Upheaval and served a prison term on conviction for 
violations of the National Security Law. Some argued that he 
could stir up conservative vs. reformist ideological polemics 
within the party. The pros and cons were equally divided, and 
eventually party executives decided to "run the risk." Their 
decision is said to have taken into consideration the fact that 
Puchon Sosa District residents are mostly working people, and 
that in the neighboring Kwangmyong District, Son Hak-kyu, a 
chaeya-oriented scholar, was elected to the National 
Assembly in a recent by-election. 
  Rumors had it that the decision was also based on the 
observation that the Democratic Party [DP] will run either its 
party spokesman, Pak Chi- won, or Pae Ki-son, former deputy 
chief secretary for the party chairman as its candidate for the 
same district, Puchon Sosa, in the next general election. It was 
for the same reason that O Song-kye was named to the Puchon 
Ojong District post. 
  The DLP was on the verge of withholding a decision on 
Songpa-B, Seoul, when Cho Yong-chik, DLP deputy spokesman, was 
finally picked thanks to the "influence" of Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil. The RDP faction strongly supported Song Chol-won, 
chairman of the Forum of Press Workers Unions. It was a close 
contest, they say. 
<H5>  Satisfied with the Outcome </H5>
  For now, party officials are satisfied with the results of 
the open recruiting, saying that they succeeded in obtaining 
"fresh candidates." As examples, they cite the cases of Yi 
Ki-hyong, staff researcher of the National Land Development 
Research Institute and a graduate of University of San Francisco 
and doctor of economics, who was named for Sosan-Taean District; 
and Kim Kwang-won, former lieutenant governor of North Kyongsang 
Province, named for Uljin District. 
  Kim Kwang-won says that "I responded to the open recruiting 
without knowing that there is a recruiting plan that is not open 
to the public." It is rumored that he drew strong support from 
Minister of Home Affairs Choe Hyong-u. It is also said that Kim 
Mun-su's "sponsor" was Kim Chong-nam, Chongwadae senior 
presidential secretary for educational and cultural affairs. 
  The nomination of Choe In-ki for Naju District practically 
had been predetermined when he was "left out" in the 
appointments of vice ministers in late December last year. Yi 
Chol-kyu, chief of the Planning and Management Office of the 
Kyonggi provincial government, who was named for Sihung-Kunpo 
District, was a case of "draft." Yi, former Sihung City mayor, 
says that the nomination was a surprise although there had been 
a hint from Choe Ki-son, Inchon City mayor and a key member of 
the RDP faction, a month ago. 
<H5>  "Preference for SNU Graduates" Criticized </H5>
  The districts of Seoul's Sodaemun-B, Socho-A, Taegu's 
East-B, 
and Hwasun of South Cholla Province were placed on the hold 
following the principle that the party will look for 
best-qualified persons having both the resolve for reform and 
local support. Also, Seoul's Kangso-A District -- of which Yi 
Won-chong, Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for 
political affairs, declined the chairmanship before the start of 
the open recruiting -- was taken off the list of open-recruiting 
districts from the beginning. 
  The 10 appointees are made up by nine Seoul National 
University [SNU] graduates and one University of San Francisco 
graduate. Of the nine SNU graduates, seven are from the law 
school. 
  Responding to criticism of too much importance having been 
attached to academic career factors, Secretary General Mun 
Chong-su "explained" that "honestly, it was by accident."

  [Text] To prepare for the local autonomy system elections 
next year, and to counter the DLP moves to win over 
chaeya personages, the DP will set in motion, as 
early as this week, a full-scale drive to unify the opposition 
camp and to draw chaeya personages into the party. 
  At its Supreme Committee meeting yesterday, the DP decided

the Executive Committee, will lead the work. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman Yi Ki-taek is expected to announce DP 
plans concerning an opposition merger and chaeya 
personages, at a press conference scheduled for today marking 
the first anniversary of his chairmanship. 
  The chairman told reporters yesterday that "I am planning to 
meet with Chairman Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and 
Chairman Yi Chong-chan of the New Korea Party shortly to discuss 
the merger issue." "Also, I will see what the Supreme Committee 
will come up with and, based on it, will work actively to draw 
chaeya personages into the party," he said. 
  "It is possible to discuss the merger issue with Chairman 
Pak 
Chan-chong of the Sinjong Party, too," he added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Court will 
render a final decision on Rep. Pak Chol-on's last appeal on 
June 28. 
  Should the court dismiss Rep. Park's final appeal, the 
original decision will be upheld and his application for bail 
automatically rejected. But if the court reverses the original 
decision, it is likely that he may be released immediately since 
his prison term ends in less than six months. 
  Rep. Pak was convicted of bribery and sentenced to one and a 
half years in prison and fined 600 million won (about 743,500 
U.S. dollars) in an appeal hearing held on March 14. He then 
appealed to the Supreme Court and asked to be released on bail. 
  Park, once called the "crown prince" during the days of the 
No Tae-u government, was arrested in May last year on charges of 
taking bribes totaling 600 million won in three installments 
from slot-machine kingpin Chong Tok-il in October and November 
1990. 
  If Pak is found guilty, he will lose his parliamentary seat 
and the right to run for parliament or other public office for 
the coming five years. A special election to replace him would 
be held within 90 days in the Susong-a Electoral District of 
Taegu City.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The government convened 
an emergency meeting Friday to discuss preventing a nationwide 
strike by railroad and subway workers. 
  Vice ministers of the Labor and Transportation Ministries 
and 
the Economic Planning Board decided to announce government 
measures to provide better working conditions, under which 
locomotive engineers and ticket inspectors would receive similar 
treatment as general clerical workers at the Korean National 
Railroad. 
  The government, however, made clear it would not negotiate 
with "Chonkihyop," [The National Council of Locomotive 
Engineers] a nationwide organization of locomotive and train 
engineers, as it is an unauthorized body separate from the 
Railroad Labor Union. 
  At the same time, the government decided to take strong 
action, including the prosecution of those involved, if the 
workers go ahead with the strike despite measures to improve 
labor conditions such as a wage hike. 
  Chonkihyop members have sided with the labor unions of the 
Seoul and Pusan subways in resolving to walk out. 
  Earlier, the Labor Ministry warned in a statement the 
government would not tolerate a joint strike by railroad and 
subway workers as it would foster social unrest. 
  Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said Friday the government has 
completed preparations for judicial action against leaders of 
Chonkihyop and Chonodae [National Conference of Representatives 
of the Workers' Cooperatives], a private organization of labor 
union representatives nationwide. 
  Minister Nam stressed the two organizations are voluntary 
and 
private organizations which are not recognized legally, saying 
their resolution on a walk-out is an apparent violation of the 
law. He said the government is preparing a wage increase and 
better labor conditions for locomotive engineers and railroad 
workers through negotiations with the authorized labor union of 
the Korean National Railroad.

  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- Since the inauguration of 
Kim Yong-sam, the Presidential Secretariat and the Presidential 
Security Service managed to cut expenses by more than 1 billion 
won apiece last year, it was revealed Friday. 
  They have achieved such savings by reducing the number and 
scope of official banquets and curtailing or symplifying the 
presidential security service, the Board of Audit and Inspection 
(BAI) said Friday. 
  The presidential secretariat managed to save 1,792 million 
won and the presidential security service, 1,299 million won, 
the BAI said. 
  It said the secretariat sliced the number of dinner parties 
catered by hotels to 54 down from 210 times in 1992 when No 
Tae-u was president. It also reduced the amount spent per 
person at luncheons and dinner parties to 22,000 won each from 
42,000 won and 65,000 won, respectively. 
  BAI officials said the secretariat spent 154.9 million won 
for luncheons and dinners, down 585.4 million won from 743.9 
million won the previous year. It managed the savings by 
serving such humble dishes as noodle soup, they said. 
  The BAI, however, issued five warnings and handed two 
official notices to the secretariat and the security service 
after noting they had wasted money by asking for service without 
concluding contracts beforehand. 
  As for souvenirs, Chongwadae managed to halve the cost of 
wristwatches carrying the presidential insignia while reducing 
the number of souvenirs to 15 kinds from 112 under the previous 
administration. 
  Chongwadae thus slashed souvenir expenses to 383 million won 
in 1993, down from 742 million won the previous year, the BAI 
said. 
  The presidential security service, meanwhile, registered 
savings totalling 1,299 million won by cutting back on manpower 
and reducing information-gathering activities and travel, the 
BAI said. 
  The board pointed out that the secretariat failed to follow 
the rules on budget spending and accounting when it designated 
suppliers before drawing up contracts to buy such equipment as 
computers (41.7 million won), work on facilities (74.6 million 
won) and publication of pictorial magazines and opinion polls 
(64.7 million won).

  [Text] The financial market is rapidly recovering from the 
"nuclear shock" as evidenced by the quick rebound in the 
composite stock exchange index to over 900 on 16 June from the 
steep two-day plunge in the wake of the North Korean declaration 
of its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The cash in the market was returned to the banking institutions 
in the amount of 210.7 billion won and 42.3 billion on 13 and 14 
June respectively, thus decreasing the cash currency rate from 
9.2 percent to 9 percent last week. With the recovery of the 
stock market, the financial market returned to a normal track. 
  The stock market, which plummeted as much as 32.3 point for 
two days on 14 and 15 June as the general public investors 
massively dumped their stocks, rebounded on 16 June as the 
institutional investors bought stocks heavily as soon as the 
stock market opened that day. The composite stock exchange 
index increased by 10.16 points to 901.08 points. 
  The recovery came as the authorities tried hard to assuage 
people's worries which abated considerably upon hearing of the 
one-month grace period which would be applicable to sanctions 
the United Nations may take against North Korea. The report on 
the government plan to ease restrictions on the stock market, 
such as the release of future deal items for the stock exchange 
index and the abolition of the institutional investors' deposit, 
also contributed to a recovery with the blue chips taking the 
lead. 
  The stock experts say that although general public investors 
are not yet completely relieved of their worries, institutional 
and foreign investors are actively buying stock, and therefore, 
the strength to support the stock market seems to be sufficient. 
  The currency in the market is following the pattern of 
"supply on weekend and returning at the start of the week." 
  On 10 June, 470 billion won was issued for soldiers' 
salaries 
and 70 billion won went into the market fund for the weekend, 
but 273 billion won returned to the banking institutions for two 
days on 13 and 14 June. This is an amount larger than the 264.4 
billion won that returned on 7 and 8 June after the 5-6 June 
holiday. 
  On 14 June, 771.6 billion won--566.3 billion won of demand 
deposit, 205.3 billion of savings deposit--returned to the 
banking institutions. This is an amount similar to that 
returning under ordinary circumstances. Therefore, the cash 
issuance decreased to 12.6 billion won and 42.3 billion won on 
14 and 15 June respectively. 
  The price of gold remained the same 41,200 won per Korean 
ton 
(3.7565 grams) since 10 June. Only the black market dollar 
price rose from 820 won to 835 won per dollar on 14 June, but it 
remained static on 15 June.

  [Text] The government will allow foreign banks operating 
in the nation to reduce the amount of money they are required to 
loan to small- and medium-sized companies, a top official of the 
Ministry of Finance said yesterday. 
  Currently, foreign banks are required to lend 35 percent of 
an increase in their total lending to small- and medium-sized 
companies. 
  Assistant Minister of Finance Sin Myong-ho said the 
government will allow them to allocate 10 percent of the loan 
increase for the purchase of bonds related to small- and 
medium-sized companies in the primary market. 
  This action taken by the government will have the effect of 
reducing the ratio to 25 percent, Sin said at the Korea-U.S. 
Business Conference which ended yesterday. 
  Referring to the North Korean nuclear issue, he said, it has 
had no serious effect on the South Korean economy. 
  "Our economy has now attained a mature phase of development 
which will allow us to sustain our economic policies without 
real effect from the present nuclear issue," he said. 
  He said South Korea's total foreign exchange holdings, which 
stand at #37 billion at the moment, are equivalent to the value 
of four months of current foreign exchange transactions. 
  Should the South and North Korean confrontation over the 
nuclear issue be prolonged, however, South Korea would find it 
difficult to secure funds in foreign money and capital markets. 
  The Ministry of Finance's internal report said Korea would 
have to pay higher rates of interest on its loans from abroad if 
the nuclear issue is not resolved at an early date. 
  The report said the ministry will encourage domestic 
corporations and financial institutions to issue depositary 
certificates to secure funds abroad instead of bonds whose 
yields may fluctuate. 
  Yields of the bonds issued by Korea corporations and 
financial institutions have recently climbed by one-sixteenth to 
one-eighth of a percentage point, the report said. 
  In the face of rising interest rates, the report said, some 
domestic banks have delayed their plans to borrow money from 
abroad.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Tae-kun from the "Reporter's Memo" column: </F>
"Seoul Metropolitan City Government's Administration Affected by 
North Korea's nuclear issue"] 
  [Text] The Seoul Metropolitan City government is agonizing 
over "the issue of inspections of North Korea's nuclear 
facilities." At a glance, there is no seemingly understandable 
relationship between "Seoul City government and North Korea's 
nuclear development" at all. This notwithstanding, there is an 
understandable story in this relationship, because there is a 
delicate functional relation in which the Seoul City government 
might suffer from not a little monetary loss, depending upon 
where the direction of North Korea's nuclear issue goes. 
  The Yankee Bonds (bonds issued in U.S. dollars by the U.S. 
stock market), which the Seoul City government was thinking 
about issuing this month, are linked to North Korea's nuclear 
issue. 
  The Seoul City government had planned to issue Yankee Bonds 
worth $300 million (240 billion won) with a view to 
investing--the funds raised by these bonds--in the equipment to 
be used for some sections of the second-phase construction of 
the Seoul Metropolitan Area subway system. The construction 
will be completed at the end of this year. Yankee Bonds, with 
interest rates of as low as 6 to 8 percent, provide better loan 
terms than any other domestic stocks because they are long-term 
bonds with a maturity of 10 years. 
  But, a problem has arisen. Tension between North Korea and 
the United States and between South and North Korea has been 
mounting to the highest point over the last few days. As a 
result, voices calling for "warning against the North" and 
"imposing economic sanctions against the North" have been heard. 
If such a situation is not removed, the Korean peninsula will 
be viewed by American investors as an unstable area, and a risk 
will be added, so that interest rates will drastically increase. 
  In fact, the interest rate, which has been regarded as 
acceptable only if it increases to 7 to 8 percent, is predicted 
to increase to over 9 percent--far exceeding the expected 
rate--as a result of the recent worsening situation surrounding 
North Korea's nuclear development. 
  This is not the only problem. The fact is that American 
institutional investors might not buy the bonds issued by the 
Seoul City government at all. If Seoul City's Yankee Bonds are 
issued and there are no buyers--which would be a very rare 
occurrence--it will be a disgrace to our country, let alone the 
Seoul City government. 
  Under these circumstances, the Ministry of Finance has given 
a guideline "of stressing the need to reconsider the timing of 
issuance of Yankee Bonds" to the Seoul City government, saying 
that "the situation surrounding North Korea's nuclear issue is 
ominous." Because of this, the Seoul City government has for the 
moment canceled its plan to issue Yankee Bonds during this 
month. But, officials concerned at the Seoul City government 
wear tearful faces, saying: "How can we now raise money for the 
construction of the subway for the latter half of this year?"

  [Text] Foreign car sales are rapidly increasing this year. 
According to data released from the Trade, Industry, and Energy 
Ministry and foreign car importers on 16 June, foreign cars sold 
in the domestic market in the January-May period numbered 1,059, 
marking an increase of 44 percent over the 735 cars sold in the 
same period last year. 
  The number of foreign cars sold was 148 in January, 119 in 
February, 233 in March, 227 in April, and 332 in May, thus 
registering a marked increase since March. 
  During the period, 586 U.S. cars were sold, accounting for 
55 
percent of all the foreign cars sold. This was followed by 249 
German cars (24 percent), 139 Swedish cars (13 percent), 63 
French cars (6 percent), and 22 Italian and British cars (2 
percent). 
  The rate of increase in the importation of cars for the 
first 
five months of this year was 15 percent, far lower than the rate 
of increase in sales in domestic market. This must have 
resulted from the considerable old stock of last year carried 
forward to this year. 
  The foreign cars imported for the first five months of this 
year were 1,286, an increase of 15 percent from the statistics 
for the same period last year. 
  Of all the foreign cars imported, U.S. made cars were 768, 
accounting for 60 percent of the total imported cars, an 
increase of four percent over the same period last year (735 
cars).

<F P=106> [By reporter Chong Yong-pae: A panel discussion on "How To </F>
Strengthen TDX Exports" attended by Pak Song-tuk, director of 
the Communications Policy Office of the Ministry of 
Communications; So Sang-to, managing director of Goldstar 
Information &amp; Communications; Pak Ha-ku, managing director of 
Korea Communications Engineering; Ho Song-pu, director of Daewoo 
Telecom; Kim No-chol, center director of Korea Telecom; Kim 
Yong-ki, director of Samsung Electronics; Im Chu-hwan, group 
leader of the Electronics and Telecommunications Research 
Institute; moderated by Kim Chong-nam, executive director of the 
Communications Industries Association] 
  [Text] The market for telecommunication equipment, 
including private area branch exchange devices, has been 
liberalized, allowing foreign companies in this field to set up 
operations in the country. The limited domestic demand plus the 
foreign competition in the country now leave Korean 
manufacturers unable to rely on the domestic market alone. To 
find a way for survival, they must strengthen exports. Following 
are views of government, business and association officials on 
this subject, with a focus on ways and means to increase exports 
of the indigenously developed digital switching system, TDX. 
(Editor) 
  --Kim Chong-nam: The nation's market for telecommunication 
equipment has been largely liberalized by multilateral and 
bilateral agreements. This is no time for our firms to stick to 
the domestic market alone; they must be more active to develop 
markets overseas. What is your views on how to strengthen 
exports of the indigenously developed digital switching system, 
TDX, including TDX-10. 
  --Ho Song-pu: Daewoo has so far exported a total of 20,000 
circuits to Iran and 50,000 circuits to the Uzbek Republic. This 
year it will concentrate more on exports, particularly to 
central Asian countries. We are already pushing exports to a few 
countries in that region. We took part in the bidding for 3.6 
million circuits in Iran, in which three companies are left in 
the final round of competition now. Of them, Daewoo is a strong 
candidate. A small-type switching system was developed last 
year, which we plan to export to China for the first time. In 
that respect, Daewoo is near an agreement with China on setting 
up a joint venture; negotiations are in the final phase. 
Daewoo's total exports so far are 70,000 circuits. 
  --Kim Yong-ki: Samsung is already exporting to China, 
Russia, 
and South American and East European countries. Through the end 
of last year, it exported a total of 520,000 circuits--200,000 
to Russia, 120,000 to China, 50,000 to South America, and 
150,000 to East Europe. We plan to focus more on countries where 
we already set up our operations, exporting an additional 1.5 
million circuits by the end of this year. Samsung plans to 
export a small-type set, TDX-1B, to China, and the large 
100,000-circuit system to Russia. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: Tell us about difficulties you experienced 
concerning exports, and how you worked on them. 
  --Kim Yong-ki: First, it was the funding problem. In placing 
an order for a large project, the ordering country is usually 
unable to do so with its own fund alone. Potential TDX importers 
are mostly poor countries. So, to promote exports, we have to 
give them loans. To support their switching system exports, 
Japan disbursed more than $51.99 billion and Germany $88.25 
billion from their respective foreign economic cooperation funds. 
  Korea's foreign economic cooperation fund is 430.2 billion 
won [W], of which only W92.6 billion was put out in support of 
TDX exports. We have difficulties in terms of funding support, 
too, for in Germany's case, it is an installment payment over 30 
years at an interest rate of 0.75% to 2% per annum 
but, in our 
case, the rate is much higher. Because of this, Samsung suffered 
a defeat in Hungary. At the last minute of signing the contract, 
Hungary turned us down in favor of Germany. 
  They told us then that their was no problem with our offer, 
the model and everything else, but the terms of funding. It 
shows what is the biggest difficulty in TDX exports. 
  Also, when making inroads into underdeveloped countries, we 
need the certification of payment but the Export Insurance 
Corporation simply refuses to provide it. This is one of the 
problems that should be corrected promptly. So far, there has 
been not a single case in which the corporation granted the 
certification. 
  --Ho Song-pu: Daewoo also finds the funding support the 
biggest problem. In Iran's case, it demands cooperation in 
funding as a precondition of bidding. In the latest bidding, 
Iran demands that our bank file an official document with the 
Iranian bank promising its funding support. We are worried if 
the Korean Export-Import Bank will respond favorably. Concerning 
our plan to export TDX-10 to Iran, we met problems with the 
Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM). We wonder why 
we are still subject to COCOM restrictions while U.S. firms 
already set up joint ventures in Russia. 
  --So Sang-to: What Goldstar can do now is to set up 
operations in developing countries, for we find it difficult to 
make inroads into the markets of the advanced nations. But the 
lack of funds is our problem, too. 
  --Kim Yong-ki: When we export TDX, we must invite technical 
workers from the importing country for training. In this case, 
the process of obtaining visas for them takes too long a time. 
Also, the officially required testing procedures are too 
complicated for newly developed devices. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: I understand that COCOM restrictions were 
lifted at the end of March this year, except for exports to 
Iran, Iraq and North Korea. That was after that that U.S. firms 
could set up operations in Russia. 
  --Kim No-chol: Companies should make efforts to win the 
certification of the international quality standard 
organization, ISO 9000. Korea Telecom will make its efforts to 
win designation as a certifying agency. Developing countries 
will sooner or later demand the ISO 9000 certification on our 
products. We should be prepared for it. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: Let's talk about the question of testing 
and 
evaluating on TDX compatibility. 
  --Im Chu-hwan: The Electronics and Telecommunications 
Research Institute is preparing for equipment to be used for the 
testing and evaluation. We cannot do it right now but will soon 
be able to provide the service. 
  --Pak Song-tuk: Korea set out to develop the small-type 
switching system in the early 1970's. It now has its own system. 
Companies should not entirely depend on the Ministry of 
Communications [MOC] in developing markets overseas. Even inside 
the government, some wonder why the MOC should be playing a 
leading role with exports by businesses. It is a fact, however, 
that the MOC is giving greater assistance to firms trying to 
make inroads into foreign markets than before. Most important in 
promoting switching system exports is to gain the importing 
nations' trust. In this respect, the MOC backs up businesses by 
promoting trust-based relationships with importing countries. 
For instance, we invite students from underdeveloped nations for 
four to six weeks of training in Korea. These things help gain 
their confidence. In Romania's case, students who had received 
such training strongly asked their government to import TDX. 
This led to TDX exports to Romania. The government's role is to 
render that type of support. The government has also disbursed a 
great deal of money from its foreign economic cooperation fund. 
In the interest rate, too, we are constantly striving to bring 
it down to the advanced nations' levels. 
  --Kim No-chol: The largest annual order Korea Telecom has 
ever placed was 2.78 million circuits. It's order for this year, 
however, is estimated at 1 million circuits. Domestic demand for 
switching systems is on the decline every year. We will, 
nevertheless, endeavor for an upturn. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: The switching system is a high-tech complex 
type of computer, semiconductor and communication device. It has 
a greater value added than other manufactured goods and is 
highly effective in inducing exports of related equipment. 
Therefore, business firms should no longer see it as separate 
commodities but part of a package. They should establish export 
strategy based on that concept, including tie-ups between 
businesses. 
  --Pak Ha-ku: Korea Communications Engineering is in charge 
of 
supporting exports. Its duty is to curb excessive competition 
and promote autonomous adjustments among the four companies in 
penetrating into foreign markets. Currently, we are conducting 
such adjustments with 78 importers. In the past, there were 
cases in which more than one company set up operations in the 
same importing country, causing the price to fall and creating 
confusion in that country. We have no such problems now. Korea 
Communications Engineering is doing designing and counseling 
services for developing countries. 
  --Pak Song-tuk: Business firms should show greater concern 
about foreign trainees, because they play a significant role in 
their governments' choosing our models. 
  --Pak Ha-ku: With the switching system alone, the value 
added 
is limited. We should make a comprehensive approach with related 
products, including lines and networks. Korea recently received 
Brunei's order for 5 years of maintenance and repair services. 
This shows that we can sell equipment to guarantee operations, 
too. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: We should conduct effective promotional 
activities to convince importers that TDX, our mainstay item, is 
superior in quality. Dacom Corporation had been using a U.S. 
model when it recently tried to add a new function. Finding that 
it has to pay an exorbitant price for new software, Dacom is 
reportedly considering switching to a domestic model. In short, 
Dacom's case shows that the domestic model is less expensive and 
better in quality. We should bring the fact to the attention of 
all importing countries. 
  --Pak Song-tuk: International trust is important. We could 
make inroads into Chinese markets because the Chinese trusted us. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: On the private level, a memorandum of 
understanding was exchanged between the Korea Communications 
Industries Association and the China Posts and 
Telecommunications Industries General Corporation. As a result, 
China will invite a Korean delegation in May, and a bilateral 
communications cooperation program will be adopted at that time. 
We will invite a Chinese delegation in the latter half of this 
year. We will have them inspect our industries during the visit 
and, if they have any requests then, we will add them to the 
program. 
  --Pak Song-tuk: The Chinese corporation is sending a 
50-member delegation to Korea. The members are very important 
because they will make the decision on the proposed TDX import. 
  --Kim Chong-nam: The matter of international trust is being 
taken care of by the government, and I am sure that there will 
be improvement in the funding issue, too, in the future. 
Therefore, all there is left for business firms to do, I think, 
is to effectively use joint export strategy through tie-ups and 
endeavor to develop markets overseas.

  [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea High-Speed Rail 
Construction Authority (KHRC) contracted with Anglo-French 
Consortium GEC-Alsthom on Tuesday for the 2,101.6-million-dollar 
high-speed train system. 
  KHRC President Pak Yu-kwang and GEC-Alsthom President Pierre 
Bilger signed the contract at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry (KCCI) in downtown Seoul. The contract will take 
effect when the KHRC makes an advance payment to GEC-Alsthom 
after the authority takes out a loan with Indosuez Bank of 
France for 2,337 million dollars, a KHRC official said. 
  With Tuesday's contract, the system for the high-speed 
railway linking Seoul and Pusan has finally been decided -- the 
TGV (Train a Grand Vitesse) -- almost three years after the KHRC 
invited bids from France, Germany and Japan on Aug. 26, 1991. 
  Train manufacturers from France and South Korea will jointly 
design the TGV trainsets late this year with production slated 
for June next year, according to the KHRC. 
  The high-speed train system will be established by September 
2001, with the TGV trains running on the 410-kilometer track 
between Seoul and Pusan in 124 minutes at a maximum speed of 300 
kilometers per hour with over 1,000 passengers aboard. 
  As for technology transfers from GEC-Alsthom to South Korean 
businesses, KHRC officials said that at least 50 percent of the 
46 trainsets must be localized and that if the localization rate 
does not reach 50 percent, Alsthom should pay a fine comprising 
20 percent of the shortfall, according to the KHRC. 
  Meanwhile, 12 Korean and French firms will participate in a 
consortium to manufacture and supply the trainsets, and the 
consortium will be divided into five groups, KHRC officials said.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 18 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the President of Mongolia P. 
Ochirbat has congratulated the President of Portugal Mario 
Soares on the occasion of the national holiday of Portugal 
sending the latter a telegram and that at the spring session of 
the Mongolian parliament it is keeping on discussing the draft 
law on mineral resources of Mongolia. 
  The newspaper publishes the information concerning the 
sitting of the constitutional court of Mongolia, which 
considered the claim by citizens S. Batdorj and T. Oldzboi 
accusing members of the Great State Hural S. Dzorig and T. 
Elbdzgborj of violating a number of provisions of the 
Constitution and drew proper decision. The constitutional court 
decided that member of the parliament S. Dzorig has violated the 
provisions of the Constitution. His being guilty was 
corroborated by the facts having been established clearly, it 
said. 
  The constitutional court considered there are no reasons to 
consider also the issue referring to T. Elbegdorj because he was 
relieved of the duties of a member of the parliament according 
to his own request. 
  A year has passed since the inauguration ceremony of the 
first president of Mongolia having been elected nationwide took 
place. In this connection President P. Ochirbat was invited as 
a honorary guest by the newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" being the central 
official press of Mongolia. "It is man that must be in the 
centre of the state policy of Mongolia" this was a title of the 
interview granted by him to the newspaper the first part of 
which was published in today's issue of the newspaper. 
  "In my opinion the major factor of the successful 
development 
of Mongolia is a well-educated and informed man. Therefore in 
the centre of the state policy should be man. This is one of 
major priorities of my policy as head of state, notes P. 
Ochirbat. We are concentrating our efforts and attention on 
that how this task should be accomplished. For instance, there 
have been worked out the main lines and conceptions of state 
policy concerning demographical, children, youth and women's 
issues as well as the matters referring to veterans and invalids. 
  On the other hand, the president went on to say, if the 
centre of the state policy is being man then the government and 
state should take care of his living and working conditions, 
provision him with proper nourishment, housing , health care and 
related services. In this sense we worked out a comprehensive 
projects of conceptions of state policy on food issues, food 
programme and the law on food and submitted them for 
consideration to the Mongolian Government and parliament, he 
pointed out. 
  The newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" informs that the 
prime 
Minister of Mongolia P. Jasray has received the ministers of 
food and agriculture, that of trade and industry, finances, of 
full power, geology and mining industry, the head of the 
national development department and of the administration of the 
government and charged them with assignments concerning the 
solution of issues having been put forth by the heads of 
administration of the Dundgobi and Omnogobi Aymags and a number 
of somons of the two aymags relating to the government. 
  The newspaper publishes the directive by the prime minister 
of Mongolia on setting up a Mongolian national committee on 
celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations 
organization. As was decided, the national committee should be 
functioning under the guidance of the minister of external 
relations of Mongolia T. Gombosuren. 
  The newspaper carries an interview of its correspondent with 
the [words indistinct] administration of the Government of 
Mongolia J. Sereeter taking part recently in the seminar held in 
Germany under the schemes of the German Foundation for 
International Development. As was noted by J. Sereeter, the 
Foundation for International Cooperation is interested in the 
development of cooperation with Mongolia in many spheres. 
  The newspaper also publishes an interview with the head of 
the society "Mongol Bichig" D. Dorligjab. In his interview he 
paid a lot of attention to the issues of resurrection of the 
Mongolian national script and its applying in keeping the state 
official business documentaries instead of that based on 
Cyrillic being currently used. 
  The newspaper "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEUEE" under the permanent 
heading "The World News" carries a number of information 
concerning the international affairs. The newspaper "MONGOLYN 
HODUU" gets its readers acquainted with the news of the 
Mongolian countryside. The newspaper gives some materials 
referring to the day-to-day activities and life of the herdsmen 
and farmers. The newspaper also publishes an article touching 
upon the issues concerning the growth in the number of the 
camel. According to the author of the article D. Tsebeenjab 
dealing with the camel study the annual reduction in the number 
of this animal is dictated by the reduction in the growth rate 
of the population. During 1991-1993 some 44 thousand head of 
camels were raised which is by 18 thousand less than three years 
before 1990 the author notes.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The rejection of the East Asia Economic Caucus, 
EAEC, by the United States comes as no surprise. Since it was 
mooted by Malaysia more than three years ago, the U.S. has 
firmly said no to the idea. However, what is most discouraging 
is that the reason for its opposition to the caucus did not hold 
water. America thinks that it will have a negative effect on 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. It is difficult to 
accept such an explanation. 
  The EAEC has been proposed as a forum to propagate the free 
trade. Rather than posing any obstacle, it will complement 
APEC. As such, there is no basis to the claim. APEC was formed 
to sustain the growth and dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region. 
However, East Asian economies have evolved in a somewhat 
different manner. Their economies unlike that of the U.S. have 
become a success story. Therefore, the promotion of the EAEC is 
a natural step forward in view of the rapid pace of economic 
integration in the region. What is more remarkable is that the 
integration has been driven by market forces. In the process 
and without doubt, East Asia has become an important economic 
entity in the global scenario. As a mere consultative forum, 
the EAEC will provide a platform for these countries to discuss 
trade and other issues of common interests. 
  It is clear that from the very beginning, the U.S. was 
annoyed with the idea since it was left out. But, the U.S. is 
not part of East Asia. How can they be part of the EAEC. 
Nevertheless, the EAEC, which has now progressed into an ASEAN 
proposal, should look forward to its formation. Enough time has 
been spent on debating the pros and cons of the caucus. The 
time has come for the EAEC to get off the ground with ASEAN 
countries as the core members. 
  Of course, there are concerns that Japan may be reluctant to 
join up now that the U.S. has rejected the idea. But this 
should not be the case. As a major economic superpower in the 
region, Japan's membership will have a tremendous impact in 
enhancing the structure of the EAEC. At the same time, Japan 
has to realize that there is also much economic dynamism in the 
other potential members. They include emerging China, South 
Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Therefore, Japan should consider 
the benefits of an EAEC comprising the most dynamic economies of 
the world. No less important is the immense combined market 
opportunities these countries will offer. Another vital role is 
that it could provide the platform for member countries to act 
as a single unit in holding out the cause and principles of free 
trade in international trade negotiations. 
  It is clearly evident that the Western powers dominate 
issues 
and decisions in international trade talks. Moves to 
institutionalize APEC are an example of how strong countries 
dominate others. This should not be the case any longer. As 
successful economies, East Asian countries need to have a 
stronger voice in the international arena so that any decision 
arrived at is equitable to all. This being the case, the speedy 
establishment of the EAEC is highly justified. This is no time 
for listening to both the skeptics and the critics. It is time 
to act.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, disappointed with the American 
stand against the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), 
hopes Japan will not be influenced by Washington. 
  Dr. Mahathir is also upset with the change in stand by the 
Clinton administration which had earlier said it would be 
open-minded towards the ASEAN proposal. 
  Foreign press reports said Washington's latest opposition to 
EAEC would make it difficult for Japan to accept ASEAN's 
invitation to join the caucus. But, Japan is waiting to be 
formally informed by the U.S. 
  Commenting on the development, Dr. Mahathir questioned the 
rationale of the U.S stand. 
  He said EAEC was not a trade bloc or formal forum but merely 
a loose establishment for economic cooperation. 
  We are very disappointed because, previously, the Clinton 
administration appeared more open minded, he told reporters 
after launching the World Islamic Civilisation Festival '94 here 
Friday. 
  Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia and its ASEAN partners had 
repeatedly explained that EAEC was not a trade bloc and they 
would continue to do so. 
  He also said Malaysia did not understand why EAEC was 
rejected. Is it because of our colour? He asked. 
  He said Malaysia would not allow the differences over the 
EAEC, originally mooted by Malaysia, to jeopardise its 
relationship with the U.S. 
  We will use our friendship to explain our stand (to the 
U.S.), he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir had said Malaysia-U.S. ties were set for the 
better after his meeting with President Clinton during his 
recent visit to the U.S. 
  Foreign Minister Datuk Dr. Abdullah Badawi said Malaysia 
hoped to get a clearer picture from Japan at the upcoming post 
ministerial conference of the ASEAN ministerial meeting in 
Bangkok later this month.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Friday the Al-Arqam Muslim 
fundamentalist movement had reached a level that could threaten 
national security, but the government would be cautious in 
taking any action to reform it. 
  The prime minister said the people might wrongly conclude 
that the government was trying to suppress an Islamic movement 
if it acted because they did not realise that Al-Arqam's 
teachings had become deviant. 
  Commenting on the Islamic centre's disclosure that Al-Arqam 
was training its own militant force, Dr. Mahathir said action 
needed to be taken to check the spread of its influence. 
  We have to act effectively and, to be effective, we need the 
people's support, he told reporters after opening the World 
Islamic Civilisation Festival '94 here. 
  Towards this end, the most important thing was to make the 
people aware that Al-Arqam had deviated from ths true teachings 
of Islam, he said.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the enforcement of the 
unanimously approved amendments to the UMNO [United Malays 
National Organization] constitution to curb money politics will 
not be back dated. However, the prime minister said that UMNO 
members who resorted to money politics in the party election 
last year might lose their chances to be chosen as Barisan 
Nasional's candidates in the next general election. The 
amendments will be taken into account in deciding UMNO 
candidates to be fielded under the Barisan Nasional ticket at 
the general election. 
  He said this at the news conference at the end of the 
special 
UMNO general assembly in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir, 
who is UMNO president said that the date of the enforcement will 
not be back dated to ensure fairness to the members. However, 
proof for the use of money in the UMNO election last year would 
be taken into account to ensure that the party's candidates who 
were clean would represent the Barisan Nasional in the general 
election. 
  The prime minister also that Malaysia is not yet prepared to 
establish diplomatic relations with Israel because the 
government is not convinced that the peace process between 
Israel and the Palestinians is settled. 
  Replying to questions from newsmen at the end of the special 
sitting of UMNO general assembly this evening, the prime 
minister disclosed that he has so far received three letters 
from Yitzhaq Rabin. In his letters to Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir, 
the Israeli prime minister has indicated his desire to establish 
diplomatic ties with Malaysia. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he has replied to all three 
letters and has also informed the cabinet about the 
correspondence. When asked to comment on the report that a 
prominent Malaysian businessman had visited Jerusalem recently, 
the prime minister said he is not aware of the visit. He also 
said that there is at the moment no defined punishment for such 
wrong. The government has also taken action against the 
Malaysian reporter who covered the peace talks between Israel 
and the Palestinians recently.

<F P=106> [By Siti Hatija Yusof] </F>
  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, 3 May -- As many as 220 Shi'ite 
Muslims led by a prominent local intellectual have been 
identified as a religious group actively propagating their faith 
to people living in urban areas. 
  Disclosing details of the group's activities, Zainal Abidin 
Abdul Kadir, chief of the Islamic Affairs Division of the Prime 
Minister's Office, said the group has made a Petaling Jaya 
housing estate its headquarters from which to launch its 
activities. He said the group is carrying out its activities by 
conducting lectures in private houses, giving sermons in 
mosques, and distributing brochures about their faith to the 
public. 
  "One of the campaigns the Shi'ite group waged called on 
members to practice contract marriages. They stressed that this 
type of marriage is justified in Islam because it was practiced 
during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. 
  "This group has also used the Prophet's name to attract 
followers because they know that devout Muslims who worship 
their Prophet will follow their teachings," he said to an UTUSAN 
MALAYSIA correspondent during an interview in his office today. 
  UTUSAN MALAYSIA today also disclosed remarks by Dr. Abdul 
Hamid Othman, deputy minister in the Prime Minister's 
Department, on the Shi'ite Muslim group's activities. These 
activities had earlier been limited to institutions of higher 
learning, but they have now begun to propagate their teachings 
to the general public in urban areas. Dr. Hamid noted the 
group's activities may split Muslims in Malaysia if left 
unchecked. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong has 
proposed a two-step approach to keep Singapore active in the 
global economy. He said the government will continue to come out 
with competitive strategy to further strengthen the domestic 
economy which will be the mainstay of the nation's prosperity. 
In addition, Singapore must create more economic space by 
becoming a partner of growth in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Mr. Yeo was speaking at the Singapore International Chamber 
of Commerce luncheon. He said given the abundant regional 
opportunities, Singapore's external economy should grow rapidly 
to match that of Switzerland and the Netherlands. At present, 
our level of private investment abroad is only about two-thirds 
of these two countries. However, Mr. Yeo stressed that 
Singapore must ensure a right balance between the domestic and 
external pressures. The growth of the external economy should 
complement and not fall out with the domestic one.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday 
called on the People's Republic of China to "exercise restraint 
in discharging their responsibility over fearsome technology" 
and to forego any further nuclear testing after the Maoist state 
conducted another nuclear test at Lop Nor last 10 June. 
  Mr. Romulo made the call on the eve of bilateral talks 
between the Philippines and China to be held today at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs office. Both governments will 
discuss a whole range of bilateral concerns, including Beijing's 
worry on the Philippines' growing relationship with Taiwan. 
  "The Philippines finds this (nuclear test) extremely 
unfortunate and regrettable. Last October, during the United 
Nations General Assembly, the Philippines asked for a moratorium 
on nuclear testing. And because China will be participating in 
the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Regional 
Forum in Bangkok this July, we will hope that they will seize 
and desist from further nuclear testing in this part of the 
world," Mr. Romulo said. 
  As a signatory to the United Nations Treaty on 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Philippines has 
affirmed to all of the accord's objectives, he said. 
  Mr. Romulo said under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the 
testing of nuclear devices should "cease forever" because it 
"gravely threatens the very existence of the human family." 
  The 10 June incident was China's second nuclear test after 
it 
conducted a previous one in October last year. 
  Mr. Romulo said the incident will seriously undermine the 
negotiations currently taking place in Geneva on a Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. "It also breaks the current moratorium on 
nuclear testing being observed by other nuclear states," he 
added. 
  The annual bilateral talks between Manila and Beijing will 
be 
chaired by Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino and 
his counterpart from the Chinese foreign ministry. 
  The two panels are expected to discuss political and 
economic 
issues affecting both countries, as well as regional ones like 
the forthcoming ASEAN Regional Forum where China is expected to 
participate. 
  Mr. Romulo, declined to comment on whether Manila's concern 
on China's nuclear testing will be a hotly debated topic during 
the bilateral meet. 
  The two groups are likewise expected to tackle other issues 
like the Philippines' one China policy.

  [Text] Indonesian Ambassador Pieter Damanik yesterday 
indicated that the mild rift in RP [Republic of the 
Philippines]-Indonesia relations over the recent Asian-Pacific 
Conference on East Timor [APCET] were healed. 
  "I can tell you that there is no problem in the relationship 
between the Philippines and Indonesia," said Mr. Damanik. 
"President Suharto appreciates very much the decision taken by 
President Ramos in connection with the APCET," he added. 
  The Indonesian ambassador likewise indicated his country was 
ready to host the RP-Moro National Liberation Front talks as 
well as participate in the first meeting of members of the East 
Asian Growth Area. He said his government was just waiting for 
the dates. 
  President Ramos yesterday witnessed the turnover of the 
formal proposal of Jakarta-based PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada 
for the South Luzon Expressway and skyway projects with the 
Philippine National Construction Company (PNCC). 
  In a press conference, Mr. Damanik said Indonesian President 
Suharto had personally given PT Citra the go signal to formalize 
talks with the PNCC, an event pending since September 1993. 
  "Actually this is a private sector initiative," he said, 
"but, since this is happening in an ASEAN country ... in the 
spirit of ASEAN, President Suharto has blessed this project," he 
said. 
  PT Citra is chaired by Mr. Suharto's daughter Siti. However, 
she was not able to come for the presentation of the proposal. 
Instead, the company's vice chairman, Djoko Ramidji, turned 
over the documents to Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar. 
  The first phase of the project will be the construction of a 
12.2-km. skyway between Bicutan and Buendia and the upgrading of 
the existing South Luzon Expressway. Total cost is some 
$300-400 million, with a two-year period. 
  In a press conference, Mr. Ramos said the formal proposal of 
PT Citra will trigger the formal negotiations between the

project will be undertaken as a government project, a 
build-operate-and-transfer project, or both.

<F P=106> [By Katsuhiro Kuroda] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 18 Jun -- On 18 June, a ROK Government 
source disclosed that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and President 
Kim Yong-sam are scheduled to hold Japan-ROK summit talks from 2 
to 3 July at Cheju Island, a resort in southern Korea. 
  This will be the first Japan-ROK summit talks since 
President 
Kim's visit to Japan last March. However, it will be the first 
such talks held in the ROK since the last talks were held in 
Kyongju between former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Kim Yong-sam last November. 
  Cheju Island has been designated as the site for talks 
because diplomatic authorities from the two countries expect 
that in promoting Japan-ROK summit diplomacy, it will be 
desirable to follow the Western style -- holding frequent 
meetings in an informal atmosphere. The last talks held in 
Japan were between [former Prime Minister] Kiichi Miyazawa and 
[former ROK President) No Tae-u in Kyoto, in November 1992. 
  The upcoming summit talks will be held over the weekend. 
With the Naples summit scheduled for 8 July, Japan intends to 
exchange views with the ROK on such issues as the North Korean 
nuclear program and the Korean peninsula situation.

  [Text] Following talks between former U.S. President 
Carter and North Korean President Kim Il-song, U.S. President 
Clinton said that the United States would resume talks with 
North Korea in connection the issue of North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear arms. In response, the Japanese 
Government sees that "although it does not mean that the United 
States has decided to disregard North Korea's past development 
of nuclear weapons, the United States has lowered the hurdles of 
the conditions for settling the issue" (according to a Foreign 
Ministry source), thus analyzing that the U.S. Government has 
taken a stalwart and hard-bred position -- showing a flexible 
attitude while continuing to discuss sanctions. In this way the 
Japanese Government welcomes such a move toward resuming talks 
between the United States and North Korea. At the same time, 
however, the government is still wondering what Pyongyang is 
really thinking and believes talks would be tough, even if 
resumed. 
  An announcement by Assistant Undersecretary of State (for 
political and military affairs) Gallucci has drawn the attention 
of the Japanese Government. He stated "the United States pays 
attention to North Korea's readiness to return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and to fully meet the requirements 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards 
agreement, including special inspections." Judging from his 
statement, the government views that by using such a delicate 
expression as "pay attention," the United States, while easing 
conditions for resuming its talks with North Korea, has sent 
North Korea the message that "Clinton's statement does not mean 
disregarding the issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons in the past." 
  Meanwhile, President Clinton's statement that "the United 
States would resume high-level talks with North Korea if 
Pyongyang is ready to freeze its nuclear program" has created a 
stir in Japan, causing the view that "the United States might 
ignore North Korea's development of nuclear weapons in the 
past." In this connection, speaking at a press conference, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said: "We do not think 
the United States only places emphasis on North Korea's future 
nuclear development." Meanwhile, a top Foreign Ministry leader 
said that "the U.S. Government statement does not mean it has 
changed its position," thus ruling out the U.S. Government's 
possible ignoring of North Korea's past nuclear development. 
Underlying these officials' remarks is the fact that "ignoring 
past nuclear development means that North Korea's nuclear threat 
to the safety of Japan could not be removed" (according to the 
Foreign Ministry source). It seems that the Japanese 
Government, in fact, has a slight concern about the U.S. 
statement because "there is a view within the U.S. Government 
that shelving the issue of North Korea's past nuclear 
development is inevitable" (according a Defense Agency source).

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 19 Jun Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Speaking about the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
nuclear arms development program in a speech on a street in 
front of the southern gate of the Japan Railway Kinshi-cho 
Station on the evening of 18 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said, "I think North Korea does not possess them [nuclear arms], 
and I think it does not intend to produce them either." Thus 
for the first time, he expressed his belief that North Korea 
neither possesses nuclear arms nor has intentions to produce 
them. Also saying, "It may be that they do not want to appear 
intimidated into doing something," Hata suggested a view that 
the reason why North Korea is adamantly rejecting complete 
nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) is because of pressure from the international community. 
  As for suspicions regarding North Korea's nuclear 
development, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry in a news conference 
recently said "it is possible that they have one or two nuclear 
weapons." The Japanese Government has also decided to discuss 
sanctions through the UN Security Council in cooperation with 
the United States, declaring "there is strong suspicion that 
North Korea is in the process of developing nuclear arms" 
(according to Foreign Ministry sources). The basis for the 
prime minister denying North Korea's possession of nuclear arms 
as well as its intent to develop them is not clear, but it is 
possible that his remark will have subtle impact on the 
direction of the system of Japan-U.S.-ROK cooperation and on 
future discussions of sanctions.

  [Text] Taku Yamasaki, deputy secretary general of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who was on a visit to North 
Korea, landed at Narita Airport on the evening of 18 June. He 
described his talks with Hwang Chang-yop, secretary in charge of 
international affairs of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] and 
other North Korean leaders to ASAHI SHIMBUN reporters in the 
following manner: 
  My visit to Pyongyang with Mr. Yoichi Tani [another LDP 
member of the House of Representatives] coincided with former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang. A photograph 
of Mr. Carter and President Kim Il-song talking on a boat took 
up considerable space on the front page of newspapers. 
Newspaper reports only listed our and Carter's itineraries 
without mentioning the substance of the meetings held. 
  However, for North Korea, which has consistently maintained 
a 
"hostile attitude toward the United States," the publication of 
the photograph with the North Korean president itself was 
extremely unusual. I felt that this was a sign that North Korea 
is starting to take a more flexible line on its negotiations 
with the United States. 
  Secretary Hwang and Secretary Kim Yong-sun, with whom we 
held 
talks, were reportedly also present at the luncheon meeting 
between President Kim and Mr. Carter. Mr. Hwang told us, "I 
have a good impression of Mr. Carter. We have expectations on 
the role he will play. We are on the right track toward holding 
the third round of high level talks between North Korea and the 
United States." 
  During our consecutive talks on several days, each lasting 
from three to four hours, when we told them, "We seek to become 
a permanent member of the UN Security Council and if a UN 
resolution on sanctions is passed, we have to cooperate," 
Secretary Hwang responded, "It is better for Japan to repent its 
past mistakes straightforwardly if it wants the world's respect. 
We are lenient toward those who repent their faults, and are 
stern toward those who do not. If Japan conspires with the 
United States and participates in the sanctions, we will not 
just let that pass." 
  While we failed to reach agreement in all the meetings, 
although the three leaders [the third one not named] all 
declared that "sanctions will be met by retaliation," they never 
failed to add in the end that "the only solution is dialogue," 
indicating North Korea will not opt for retaliation. 
  Secretary Kim Yong-sun also said, "Misunderstanding arises 
if 
North Korea and Japan do not meet and talk. There is a need to 
deepen bilateral relations on the basis of the joint communique 
issued by the WPK, the LDP, and the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan in 1990." North Korea also invited the LDP to send a 
delegation to visit the DPRK, indicating a strong desire to 
normalize relations between Japan and North Korea. 
  We told them that the U.S.-North Korea talks and a solution 
to the nuclear issue should come first. At the end of each 
session, we always reconfirmed our common position that 
"denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula is 
indispensable for stability in Northeast Asia." 
  I remember in particular that Secretary Kim Yong-sun touched 
on the political situation in Japan, saying, "We are also 
concerned by the unstable political situation in Japan. North 
Korea is united under President Kim Il-song. Secretary Kim 
Chong-il goes to the people and shares their joy and sorrows. 
The people believe that if they execute Secretary Kim 
Chong-il's orders, they can have happiness."

  [Text] On 16 June, the ruling coalition worked out a draft 
plan on dealing with the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear 
arms development, which will be a focal point in discussion with 
both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on a possible future coalition 
framework. Among topics of the draft plan, which was formulated 
from the viewpoint of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and 
Japan's security system, are: 1) Necessary domestic conditions 
will be created to enable Japan to respond to the United 
Nations' and the international community's decisions, including 
sanctions against North Korea; 2) Japan will closely cooperate 
with the United States and South Korea; and 3) the domestic 
crisis-control system, including legal measures, will be 
promptly established, and if necessary, the legislation of a 
"basic security law" will be considered. The coalition intends 
to submit the plan to both the LDP and the SDPJ early next week. 
  A policy study group, the "Committee To Discuss Japan's 
Security and Future," worked out the draft plan for the purpose 
of discussing it at policy consultations with the LDP and the 
SDPJ and preparing for future legislation by House of 
Representatives members. The committee (chaired by Yukihisa 
Yoshida, Democratic Socialist Party vice chairman) is comprised 
mainly of ruling coalition members. 
  With regard to concrete measures such as economic sanctions, 
the draft plan says Japan should cooperate not only in UN 
sanctions but also in "multilateral" actions such as those taken 
during the Gulf War. 
  As for cooperation with the United States and South Korea, 
it 
stipulates: "Japan will manage the Japan-U.S. security system 
flexibly depending on changes in the situation, and will provide 
support and cooperation to the United States within the 
framework of the system. On the other hand, Japan will 
positively promote cooperation with South Korea. To that end, 
legal and other arrangement will be made." 
  Regarding the establishment of the domestic crisis-control 
system, the draft plan points out: "An emphasis will be 
attached to national security; protection of Japanese people's 
lives, assets, and welfare; and maintenance of order in the 
Japanese society." It also notes the need to improve laws and 
regulations in anticipation of rescuing Japanese people living 
abroad and accepting refugees.

  [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula is growing 
tense as the UN Security Council [UNSC] studies ways to slap 
sanctions against North Korea. It was learned on 17 June that 
the U.S. Government has asked the Japanese Government to 
cooperate in airlifting foreigners, including Americans, from 
South Korea when it airlifts Japanese in South Korea back to 
Japan. Upon receiving the request from the U.S. Government, the 
Japanese Government plans to do its best for an early enactment 
of an amendment bill to the Self- Defense Forces Law [SDFL] to 
make it possible for the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] to send its 
transport planes to South Korea to airlift them back to Japan. 
The Japanese Government also has begun studying ways to revamp 
the current customs system and the current immigration process, 
and to use naval ships which can transport more people than 
aircraft. 
  According to a 17 June disclosure by a government source, 
the 
U.S. Government has made the request to the Japanese Government 
through diplomatic channels, and during his 14 June telephone 
conversation with Prime Minister Hata, President Clinton told 
Hata that the United States intended to reinforce U.S. forces in 
South Korea and then asked Japan's cooperation in airlifting 
foreigners, including Americans, in South Korea back to Japan. 
  The President is believed to have asked Japan to cooperate 
in 
airlifting Americans in South Korea after concluding that Japan 
cannot take any military action because of its constitutional 
constraints and Japan's possible contributions must be confined 
to nonmilitary areas like "rear support." 
  About 30,000 dependents of U.S. military personnel reside in 
South Korea. The situation is that they must be evacuated from 
South Korea via Japan to the United States and Japan's 
cooperation is indispensable for their evacuation. 
  The amendment bill to the SDFL is under deliberation in the 
Security Committee of the House of Representatives. If the 
amendment bill to the law were enacted, it would make it 
possible for the SDF to use its airplanes to airlift Japanese 
and foreigners in South Korea back to Japan. The prospect of 
enacting the amendment bill during the current Diet session is 
slim because of the failure to adjust between an amendment bill 
proposed by the government and another amendment bill proposed 
by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. There is a 
possibility that the Diet will take up the amendment bill for 
deliberation in the closing days of its current session 
depending on how the UNSC handles the question of imposing 
sanctions against North Korea for its suspected development of 
nuclear weapons and how North Korea responds to the sanctions in 
the future. 
  There is a strong view among experts that airports will be 
targets of attacks in the event of an emergency and ships are 
more efficient than aircraft in terms of transport. Neither the 
current SDFL, nor the amendment bill allows the use of SDF ships 
for transport of such people. The Japanese Government, 
therefore, has no choice but to use civilian ships for their 
transport. The government is expected to be pressed to adjust 
domestic opinions on the use of civilian ships.

  [Text] It was learned on 16 June that U.S. forces in Japan 
[USFJ] have surveyed air bases of the Air Self-Defense Force 
[ASDF] that can be used by the latest U.S. fighter jets at a 
time when debates on sanctions against North Korea have heated 
up. The USFJ is believed to have surveyed the ASDF air bases to 
prepare for an emergency on the Korean peninsula. The USFJ 
appears to have chosen four air bases -- Chitose Air Base, 
Mizawa Air Base [currently under joint use by Japan and the 
United States), Matsushima Air Base, and Komatsu Air Base -- for 
use by U.S. forces. Those air bases are expected to be used by 
U.S. Air Force fighter jets that are deployed from the United 
States to Japan to bolster the fighting capability of the USFJ 
in the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula. There is a 
possibility that the USFJ will ask the ASDF for rear support. 
The use of those air bases by U.S forces will certainly trigger 
a controversy because it raises the question of Japan's exercise 
of the right of collective self-defense. 
  In the past few months, U.S. forces have deployed Patriot 
missiles and armed helicopters in South Korea. U.S. forces also 
plan to deploy more fighter jets in South Korea and quickly 
deploy aircraft carriers in waters off the Korean peninsula. 
There is no change in the USFJ's air power. The survey of ASDF 
air bases by the USFJ is taken as their first move in Japan 
following the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The USFJ is believed to intend to use the ASDF air bases to 
bolster its air power and to enhance readiness to prepare for an 
emergency on the Korean peninsula. Chitose Air Base and 
Matsushima Air Base are far away from the Korean peninsula and 
North Korea's fighter jets have a short flying range, with the 
exception of MiG-29 fighter jets. The USFJ is believed to want 
to use the two air bases for defensive purposes. 
  According to a source in the Defense Agency [DA], U.S. 
forces 
in the United States plan to send air wings consisting mainly of 
F-16 fighter jets to Japan in the event of emergency in the Far 
East. The U.S. forces also plan to send Airborne Warning and 
Control System (AWACS) aircraft and air tankers to Japan. It is 
unclear how many combat aircraft the U.S. forces plan to send to 
South Korea in the event of an emergency on the Korean 
peninsula. An air wing is composed of 25 F-16 fighter jets and 
400 ground crews. 
  In the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, there 
is a possibility of the USFJ asking the ASDF for rear support 
including the supply of oil and ammunition. It is difficult for 
the ASDF to provide such rear support under the current law. If 
emergency legislation with a limited period of enforcement on 
the Acquisition and Cross-Serving Agreement (ACSA) is enacted, 
then the ASDF would be able to provide rear support for the 
USFJ, depending on the circumstances. 
  The ASDF's rear support for the USFJ may constitute a 
"military action," and Prime Minister Hata has stated that 
"Japan cannot participate in any military action." The ASDF's 
rear support for the USFJ, therefore, may trigger the question 
of Japan's exercise of the collective riht of self-defense. 
  There is a view that the USFJ has surveyed the SDAF air 
bases 
in a bid to look for shelters for U.S. military aircraft, and it 
remains unclear how the USFJ intends to use the ASDF air bases. 
The fact is important, however, that the USFJ has studied the 
possibility of using ASDF facilities at a time when the 
situation on the Korean peninsula has grown tense. Another 
source in the DA, has tried to keep the survey of ASDF air bases 
by the USFJ from triggering any controversy, saying, "I believe 
that the USFJ is simply preparing for the worst case." 
  The USFJ is able to use five ASDF air bases including 
Chitose 
Air Base, Hyakuri Air Base, and Komatsu Air Base only when joint 
Japan-U.S. military exercises are conducted. There is no legal 
basis for the USFJ to use those air bases in the event of an 
emergency. A senior DA official has indicated that "the ASDF and 
the USFJ can jointly use those air bases in accordance with the 
Japan-U.S. Status of Force Agreement."

  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, asked at the House of 
Councillors' Budget Committee on 17 June if Japan has the 
capability or intention to develop nuclear arms, made a "cunning 
remark" that could be interpreted as having meant "Japan has the 
capability to develop nuclear arms." 
  Hiroshi Oki of the Liberal Democratic Party, discussing the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), said: "I think Japan has 
the capability to possess nuclear arms, but it has chosen not to 
possess them to cooperate (with the NPT). What do you think of 
this view, prime minister?" To that question, the prime 
minister replied, "I am completely of the same view." Later on, 
he told reporters in the Diet, "Certainly, Japan has the 
capability to possess nuclear arms, but has not produced them 
because of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty." 
  The government so far has totally denied the possibility of 
using nuclear power for military purposes, insisting that 
"Japan's use of nuclear power is limited to that for peaceful 
purposes." A person close to the prime minister admitted: "We 
cannot help if someone claimed his remarks deviated from what 
the government has said so far." As a result of the suspicions 
regarding the DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear development, there 
are now people in some circles in Asia and the United States 
"talking about Japan acquiring nuclear weapons." That being the 
case, the prime minister's office and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs are trying to dampen the excitement arising therefrom, 
saying, "The remarks can bring useless misunderstanding at home 
and abroad." 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, in a news 
conference 
on the evening of 17 June, revised the remarks of the prime 
minister, saying, "the prime minister's remarks were somewhat 
inadequate. Japan's nuclear power is limited to peaceful use." 
Frowning to the reporters, he said, "I must explain these 
things to the prime minister properly." 
  The prime minister looked as if he were surprised by such 
reaction within the government. Asked later in the evening by 
reporters to give his view again, he said, "Did I really say 
that? I do not remember." He then said emphatically, "What I am 
stressing is that although we have the capability, we are 
against nuclearization. I did not mean to say that we have the 
capability but do not use it. [sentence as received] We will 
never have nuclear weapons, from the standpoints of nuclear 
non-proliferation as well as from the three nonnuclear 
principles. There is no question about that." He thus in fact 
retracted his remarks, but this matter is likely to make waves, 
in a subtle manner, at home and abroad.

  [Text] In reference to remarks made by Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata that could be interpreted as meaning that Japan has 
the capability to develop nuclear arms, and asked by the news 
corps in the prime minister's residence "How would you explain 
it? There are big reactions from China," the prime minister 
said: "What explanation? Does one have to give an explanation 
on such a trivial matter? Talk about capability... I heard a 
long time ago that even a Tokyo University student can make 
them." He thus insisted that there are no problems with the 
remarks he has made, and said he is not thinking about offering 
any explanation. 
  The prime minister said emphatically, "To begin with, we 
have 
never even imagined going to war with nuclear arms. Shall I 
call them stupid objects? As a politician, I have never once 
thought about possessing them (nuclear arms). We can do without 
such undesirable things. I will faithfully work toward 
completing the abolition of nuclear arms."

  [Text] On 18 June it was revealed that, Washington 
unofficially sounded Tokyo out about the possibility of jointly 
developing a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, by 
specifically presenting areas of cooperation including 
downsizing of a mobile launching device. 
  The United States has shown strong interest in developing 
the 
system using Japan's civilian-product technology. The recent 
revelation makes it clear that Washington gives importance to 
"realizing technical cooperation" in the Japan-U.S. TMD system 
talks. Defending the nation from ballistic missile attacks has 
been argued about in the current Diet session in connection with 
the tense situation in North Korea. Thus, how the TMD talks 
develop from now on will draw the attention of various sectors. 
  The TMD system was devised to counter ballistic missile 
attacks. It is composed of Theater High Altitude Area Defense 
(THAAD) missiles, a control system, a space-based censor, and 
other devices. Talks on the TMD system have been promoted by a 
working-level task force established by Japan and the United 
States. As "an example of Japan-U.S. cooperation," Washington 
unofficially proposed joint development of a compact, mobile 
launching device by using Japan's civilian-product technology 
and parts. 
  Washington also referred to the possibility of using 
Japanese- made composite materials to reduce the weight of 
missiles so their range will be improved. Moreover, it sounded 
Tokyo out about the possibility of exchanging techniques in such 
areas as optical electronics technology, which is needed for 
developing a guidance system, and technology for the production 
of electronic equipment and radar circuits. 
  At the ministerial-level talks on Japan-U.S. security 
(called 
the 2+2 meeting) held in March, then Defense Director General 
Kazuo Aichi commented on Japan's cooperation in developing the 
TMD system, saying: "I am thinking about clearly stating that 
the government will study this when it reviews the national 
defense program guidelines." 
  There are growing voices within the government that while 
keeping an eye on North Korea, Japan should actively work to 
establish an air defense system against missile attacks, which 
is a "blind spot" in Japan's defense buildup.

  [Text] Nobuo Matsunaga and his party, who had represented 
Japan in the OECD Ministerial Council meeting, met with Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata at the Diet on the morning of 16 June, and 
reported to him on the discussions made at the council meeting. 
They reported that in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
both sides agreed that: 1) even though the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks have resumed, it will be impossible to resolve 
everything by the time of the industrial nations' summit (Naples 
summit) in July, and 2) the two countries must turn the 
Japan-U.S. top leaders' meeting at the Naples summit into a 
success by making progress in the framework talks, and it is 
necessary to make preparations for that. 
  In his report to Hata, Matsunaga said: "The United States 
has become realistic." The prime minister responded: "That is 
good." 
  In regards to the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) 
suspected 
nuclear arms program, Matsunaga reported he told Secretary 
Christopher: "The ultimate target common to Japan and the 
United States is to have North Korea come to a table of dialogue 
and to have that country observe international rules. Our task 
is to make efforts toward peace." He also reported he told 
Christopher: "Japan will render its maximum possible 
cooperation, but if we have too high expectations on the 
effectiveness of sanctions, we can be disappointed."

  [Text] The Nomura Securities group will support 
medium-sized companies moving into Asia. Nomura-Jafko [as 
published] Investment Asia (NJI), the group's investment 
promotion company, will construct a large industrial complex in 
Vietnam in cooperation with a local corporation, and will invite 
into it 100 medium Japanese companies which are trying to cope 
with the problem of high-yen. Nomura Securities Company will 
also raise venture funds [preceding two words in English] to 
procure the necessary funds. In China, Nomura Citic [as 
published], the group's management consulting company, will help 
subsidiaries of large corporations establish plants there. The 
group's operations are drawing attention as they show a new way 
of helping fund-short medium companies go overseas. 
  NJI and a development corporation in Haiphong, Vietnam, will 
build an industrial complex of about 170 hectares in the 
Kuantwan [as published] District in the suburbs of Haiphong. 
All the required construction costs, which are expected to run 
to about 10 billion yen, will be borne by the Nomura group, 
which will then levy rents on the companies to operate in the 
complex. 
  The companies using the complex are expected to be those 
making electric appliances and auto parts, for whom the impact 
from the recent high yen is most serious. This is the first 
time that a group made up of financial institutions and 
securities companies will take a lead in constructing an 
industrial complex in Vietnam. 
  By helping the companies advance overseas, the group can 
strengthen ties with them, and gain the chances of doing 
business like brokering fund procurement. A final preliminary 
survey will be done by the end of this month. With details of 
the project such as total investments and construction period 
finalized, a joint venture company to implement the project will 
be set up in August. 
  Vietnam is expected to open a stock exchange next year. As 
such, if the Japanese companies to move into the industrial 
complex form joint ventures with local firms, they will be able 
to have their stocks listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange. 
In future, Nomura Securities will raise 10-20 billion yen in 
venture funds for the companies listed with the stock exchange. 
The idea is to recycle funds from Japan's institutional 
investors back into the Vietnamese market and to make the 
Japanese companies use them as their working funds. 
  In China, Nomura Citic in Beijing is now functioning as a 
channel for inducing Japanese companies. There is a plan for 
subsidiary companies of large electric appliance manufacturers 
to move to Shanghai in a group together. The Nomura group will 
support the efforts to transfer production bases to China. 
  The reason the medium-sized enterprises want to move their 
production bases to Vietnam or China is because labor costs in 
these countries are cheaper than in Japan and because 
high-quality labor forces can be secured despite this. Some 
people complain that this can lead to a hollowing out of the 
domestic industry, but the Japanese companies' transfer of 
plants to the cheap-labor Asian region is expected to grow to be 
able to maintain their international competitiveness in the 
current situation of the yen's value continuing to rise.

  [Text] (Hanoi, 31 May--Takaaki Mizuno) According to 
Vietnamese Government sources, Toyota Motor Corp. recently 
exchanged memoranda with the Vietnam Engine Agricultural 
Machinery Company (VEAM) of Vietnam, and has begun to study 
commercializing the manufacture of autos in Vietnam. In Vietnam, 
which is proceeding with opening up to foreigners, Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. announced that it had begun production of small 
buses jointly with a Malaysian firm in May. Various U.S. and 
European firms, such as Chrysler of the United States, are also 
probing expansion. By Japan's largest firm, Toyota, embarking on 
a study of commercialization, it appears that there will be 
full-scale competition in expansion by various countries. 
  These memoranda were exchanged during a visit to Vietnam in 
May by Toyota Director Akira Yokoi. A team will be created by 
Toyota and VEAM, and they will survey prospects for the auto 
industry in Vietnam for the period of the next 20 years up until 
2015, and explore possibilities of expansion. They are scheduled 
to compile it by August. 
  VEAM was inaugurated in 1990 under the jurisdiction of the 
Vietnam Ministry of Heavy Industries. It is the country's 
largest machinery manufacturer, embracing 12 diesel engine and 
other factories. It has a record of technical cooperation with 
Yanmar in engines for agricultural machinery. In the outlook of 
the Vietnamese Government, it is estimated that the number of 
autos possessed in Vietnam, which currently appears to be 
200,000 cars, will increase to over 650,000 in the next 20 years. 
  Regarding the study of commercialization with VEAM, although 
Toyota Motor considers that "nothing has been decided on 
specifics (such as joint-venture production)," it is showing a 
positive stance on early expansion, saying that "Vietnam is 
moderate in size as a market compared to China." 
  Since Toyota opened resident offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh 
City in July 1993, it has proceeded with collection of 
information. The recent conclusion of memoranda means that the 
investigation of possibilities for expansion has advanced one 
step. 
  According to a private research institution knowledgeable 
about the auto industry in Asia, VEAM "has experience in engine 
and other parts manufacture, and also has facilities and 
personnel." 
  However, the government agencies that have jurisdiction over 
automakers in Vietnam are divided into the Ministry of 
Transportation and Communications and Ministry of National 
Defense, in addition to the Ministry of Heavy Industries which 
presides over VEAM, and basic auto production cultivation policy 
is not determined. For this reason, Toyota's policy is to await 
the completion of the survey with VEAM and cautiously study 
joint-venture parties and the time.

  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary general of 
Shinseito, met with Makoto Tanabe, former chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]; Hirotaka Akamatsu, former SDPJ 
secretary general; and members of the "Democrats," which is a 
policy group formed by middle-of-the-roaders and rightists of 
the SDPJ, for about two hours at a hotel in Tokyo on the evening 
of 15 June. At the meeting, Ozawa called for the SDPJ's return 
to the coalition after holding consultations on political power. 
They agreed to continuously cooperate with each other in 
promoting policy meetings for the coalition's reconstruction. 
It was the first time Ozawa held a meeting with senior SDPJ 
members on the government's stability and to directly call on 
the same party for its return to the coalition. It seems that 
the agreement will have a major impact on development of the 
political situation for the time being. 
  To form a coalition with the SDPJ, Ozawa asked the 
participants to have detailed discussions. While stressing his 
intention to hold discussions with the SDPJ, he said: "We will 
join hands with anybody. If the SDPJ wants to form a coalition 
with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], I would say go ahead. 
Time will run out for you if you hesitate." In this way, he 
disclosed his intention to aim at acting in concert with the LDP 
if the SDPJ refuses to hold meetings with the coalition on 
jointly taking political power. 
  Moreover, on cooperation with the LDP, Ozawa said: "We 
cannot cooperate with the LDP. However, we may cooperate with 
people who seceded from the LDP." In this way, he explained a 
view that a precondition for cooperating with LDP members is for 
them to secede from the party first. 
  It was Ozawa's idea to hold the meeting. Kozo Watanabe, 
acting representative secretary general of Shinseito, and Kenji 
Yamaoka, Shinseito's lower house Dietman, attended the meeting. 
From the "Democrats," Tadayoshi Murai, who is head 
representative; Kenji Taguchi and Junsuke Iwata, who are lower 
house Dietmen; and Shoji Motooka, upper house Dietman, also 
attended.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general </F>
of the ruling Komeito, by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 14 June: place not 
given] 
  [Text] In an interview with YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 14 June, 
Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of the ruling Komeito, 
touched on the possibility of the ruling parties forging a 
coalition with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and 
said: "It would be natural for the ruling parties to first call 
on the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to 
return to the ruling coalition. If some LDP members, who agree 
with our handling of major issues, hope to work together with 
the ruling parties, then the ruling parties see no reason to 
dash their hopes." In this way, he indicated that the ruling 
parties will seek a "conservative-conservative coalition" with 
some LDP members who agree with policies of the ruling parties 
in a bid to keep the coalition government stable. 
  Commenting on the strong resistance to the 
conservative-conservative coalition within the ruling parties, 
Ichikawa stated: "If 180 lawmakers affiliated with the ruling 
parties stay united against the LDP, the nucleus of their 
reformist policies would be maintained even if the ruling 
parties forge a coalition with some LDP members. If the 
coalition with some LDP members is taken as a process of 
realigning the established parties, it would be a shortsighted 
view. There is no need to take such a view." 
  The idea is surfacing within the ruling parties of a 
sweeping 
reshuffle of the Hata cabinet instead of its voluntary general 
resignation that SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo has 
demanded. Commenting on the idea, Ichikawa said: "The general 
resignation of the Hata cabinet is an issue that has to be 
resolved in the grand process of realigning the established 
political parties, of making the SDPJ return to the ruling 
coalition, and of rallying a majority of political forces on the 
basis of a policy consensus."

  [Text] Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono 
granted an interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN at party headquarters on 
14 June. In severely criticizing the proposal by Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other 
coalition members for forming the so-called 
"conservative-conservative alliance" [with some LDP members], 
Kono stated: "The minority coalition is calling for such an 
alliance in a bid to prolong its life. Its attitude of seeking 
a "conservative-conservative alliance" while urging the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to return to the coalition is 
illogical. I cannot help thinking the proposal is intended to 
induce a split within other parties. At present, I have no 
intention of seriously studying it." Then, he indicated there 
is no possibility of allying with Shinseito, saying: "No matter 
what good policies [the coalition adopts], it is not good that a 
democratic method has not been taken." 
  With regard to whether the LDP intends to hold 
policy-coordination talks with the SDPJ and other parties, Kono 
pointed out: "It depends on the nature of (the post-Hata) 
administration." He stated: 1) If the [post-Hata] 
administration intends to become an election-administrating 
cabinet, it is not necessary for the LDP to closely reconcile 
policy differences with other parties because each party 
competes in an election with its own policies; in this case, it 
is advisable to reach an accord on some points of policies; and, 
2) if the administration intends to become a full-fledged 
cabinet, it is necessary to thoroughly adjust policy differences 
with other parties. 
  In commenting on some LDP members, including former Deputy 
Prime Minister Michio Watanabe and Political Reform Headquarters 
Chairman Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, showing a positive stance on the 
so-called "conservative-conservative alliance," Kono stressed: 
"I am sure that they will not act personally if [the coalition] 
makes approaches to LDP individuals, not to the whole party." 
  Regarding the possibility of submitting a no-confidence 
motion against the Hata Cabinet after Diet passage of the fiscal 
1994 national budget bill, Kono said: "The Hata Cabinet is not 
an orthodox administration under parliamentary democracy. 
Through interpellation to the prime minister's policy speech, 
we have already conveyed to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata our 
demand that he make a grave decision after budget deliberations 
end. There is no change in our intention. We and other 
opposition parties share the view that (the cabinet) should be 
changed after budget deliberations end." He thus reiterated a 
strong determination to submit a no-confidence motion against 
the Hata Cabinet. However, Kono hinted that at present, the LDP 
has no prospects for cooperating with the SDPJ and other parties 
in dealing with the no-confidence motion. He said: "Now is the 
time to obtain consent from many people on the no-confidence 
motion to overthrow the Hata Cabinet. After that, we would like 
to have a free-hand."

  [Text] Speaking at a lecture in Tokyo on the afternoon of 
16 June, Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] General 
Secretary Wataru Kubo touched on a coalition blueprint the SDPJ 
plans to submit as early as next week. He said: "Even if we 
place our policies highly, this does not always meet the 
people's expectations. Our policies should be broad ones that 
can win the support of the various coalition parties." In this 
way, he indicated his view that in hammering out the party's 
alliance proposal, the party will give priority to basic 
agreements reached with the ruling parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Socialist Party [DSP], by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Would you give priority to the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] return to the 
coalition or to the coalition's cooperation with some members of 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]? 
  Yonezawa: The first objective is to have the SDPJ and the 
New Party Sakigake return to the coalition. Even if the SDPJ 
comes back into the coalition, the number of the ruling partiy 
seats in the House of Representatives is not enough. Therefore, 
it is a matter of course for us to persuade some LDP members to 
join us. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The opinion of the SDPJ is also divided 
over the issues of returning to the coalition and submission of 
a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. 
  Yonezawa: It is still uncertain when we will hear the 
conclusions of their debates on the concept of taking power and 
other matters. In a way, we are becoming impatient. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ and the coalition 
will be able to agree on the North Korean issue and the tax 
system? 
  Yonezawa: The SDPJ signed the fundamental agreement before 
the Hata administration was formed. Therefore, I am sure we can 
reach an agreement if we confer with each other in a positive 
manner. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Can you comment on the possibility of 
forming a "coalition of the conservatives of the LDP and the 
coalition?" 
  Yonezawa: Saying that would be too optimistic. It is the 
same as saying that we need to find some LDP members who will 
cooperate with us, because we do not have enough Diet seats. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How about a coalition with former Prime 
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone? 
  Yonezawa: It would be an attempt to go against the current 
of the times. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the idea of voluntary 
en masse resignation? 
  Yonezawa: The coalition will loose its centripetal force as 
soon as the Hata administration says it will dissolve the 
cabinet. Using common sense, it is difficult to think that Hata 
will be re-elected to the premiership after an en-masse 
resignation. He will have to take his second and third best 
measures, including major cabinet reform. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the opposition 
parties' movement to submit a no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet? 
  Yonezawa: It seems that this movement is heating up. 
However, some people will also speak against it. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ will submit a 
no-confidence motion first? 
  Yonezawa: I do not think so. Submission of a no-confidence 
motion is tantamount to saying that they will not join the 
coalition. 
  [YOIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Hata administration will 
remain in power as a minori minority government and pending 
issues will be settled during the next extraordinary Diet 
session? 
  Yonezawa: Of course, we will be talking about these 
possibilities if the opposition parties betray our hopes to 
enact the bills to redraw the electoral districts and to pass 
the budget related bills, at least. The lower house will be 
dissolved if we have to start the autumn Diet session without 
realizing our hopes.

  [Text] House of Representatives members of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who support chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, decided on 14 June to form a new intraparty group as a 
counterforce against the party's largest group "Democrats," 
which supports general secretary Wataru Kubo who is eager for 
SDPJ's return to the coalition administration. If the Tsutomu 
Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse, the new group intends 
to strongly demand an early dissolution of the House of 
Representatives and a general election. Following the move, the 
conflict within the party will certainly worsen. 
  The new group will develop from the "group for promotion of 
true political reform," which backed Mr. Murayama in the 
chairmanship election in September last year. Former SDPJ 
General Secretary Tsuruo Yamaguchi (chairman of the House of 
Representatives' Budget Committee) proposed the formation of the 
new group. They will hold a general meeting on 21 June to 
formally form the group centering on Diet Administration 
Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka and Deputy General Secretary 
Hideyuki Maejima. They intend to expand and reorganize the 
group in the future by inviting middle-of-the-roaders and former 
cabinet members to join the group. 
  In a platform on "calling for regathering" which was worked 
out on 14 June, they agreed to the recent party policy of 
"demanding a dissolution [of the lower house] and a general 
election" if the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en masse. At 
the same time, the platform virtually stresses the need to start 
election preparations in anticipation of a lower house 
dissolution and a general election under the current multiseat 
electoral system, saying: "We have to prepare for establishing 
the structure for dealing with a general election." Moreover, 
it denies the possibility of allying with both Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and Komeito, saying: "We severely criticize the 
Liberal Democratic Party for its corrupted system resulting from 
money-oriented politics and the "Ichi-Ichi line" [the alliance 
between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa] for their way of managing 
politics by use of pressure tactics. We need to put "social 
democrats and liberals" together as the third force."

<F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Japan, by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] The Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] has proposed that "the Hata Cabinet voluntarily resign en 
masse and a new coalition government be formed." Do you think 
that can happen? 
  [Kubo] It is important that the Hata administration 
completes its missions first. 
  [Reporter] How is your party planning to negotiate with the 
ruling parties concerning a new government? 
  [Kubo] It must be done very carefully. The negotiations 
cannot make headway if the SDPJ only adheres to its position and 
wants other parties to follow it. We will consolidate views 
within the party, but a consolidated view should be a flexible 
one to gain agreement on it from other parties that will 
participate (in the negotiations). 
  [Reporter] What are the conditions the SDPJ cannot accept at 
the negotiations? 
  [Kubo] As long as we are asking the Hata Cabinet to resign 
en masse, "Kaishin" (the parliamentary group) must be disbanded. 
We do not mind parties with the same ideas forming a floor 
group. But we think they should do so openly so that other 
floor groups can see what is going on. 
  [Reporter] What about the running of the government? 
  [Kubo] It should be run in a transparent and democratic way. 
As the final decision-making body, what we need is (not a 
representatives conference but) something like a general council 
comprised of 20-30 members, with the number of members 
apportioned by the size of the groups they represent. 
  [Reporter] Will your party submit a no-confidence motion 
against the cabinet? 
  [Kubo] This is not a question of having to choose whether 
the cabinet should resign to enable formation of a new 
government or the House of Representatives should be dissolved 
for a general election. If the Hata administration completes its 
missions and we can make headway in forming a new 
administration, there will be neither the dissolution of the 
House for a general election nor a no-confidence motion. But if 
this course of action is rejected, we will go for submission of 
the no-confidence motion. As long as we follow that step, I 
think the SDPJ can act in perfect union. 
  [Reporter] Some members of the ruling parties talk about a 
large scale cabinet reshuffle. What do you think about that? 
  [Kubo] There has been no specific proposal for it. Hence I 
think commenting on that at this point can be a barrier to 
possible new developments. But the cause that resulted in the 
SDPJ's departure from the coalition must be eliminated. 
  [Reporter] What do you think of a move on forming the 
so-called conservatives' alliance with conservatives? 
  [Kubo] This is something we must be most wary about. If a 
conservative coalition government is to come, it will be led by 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and this will mean reversing 
history. 
  [Reporter] Can the SDPJ participate in a government 
participated in by former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe 
of the LDP? 
  [Kubo] That will be difficult. If the ruling parties reject 
an alliance with the SDPJ, we should look for the possibility of 
forming a grand alliance between conservatives and reformists. 
  [Reporter] What is your view on a move toward an alliance 
between the LDP and the SDPJ? 
  [Kubo] I am opposed to the idea of allying with the LDP -- 
that idea that came in reaction to the thinking that "the SDPJ 
should not ally with Shinseito." That will only mean that the 
SDPJ will come to play a complementary role in the LDP 
administration.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has 
basically confirmed the outline of its coalition blueprint which 
the party has been working out in preparation for policy 
consultations with the ruling coalition and other parties. 
Among the main pillars of the blueprint are: 1) The coalition 
should abide by agreements and memorandums signed at the time of 
the inauguration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
administration; 2) regarding policies, as a rule, the coalition 
should carry forward agreements reached at the time of the 
inauguration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's administration, 
which includes the revision and abolition of the consumption 
tax; and 3) government affairs should be managed by a group of 
representatives from each party, and final decisions should be 
made via a meeting of party heads. 
  The party plans to finalize its blueprint after further 
integrating party members' opinions, but the party is divided 
over pending policy issues as well as which parties it plans to 
join in a new coalition alliance. It also places the mass 
resignation of the incumbent administration as a precondition to 
its forming a new coalition. Therefore, there is no question 
that rough sailing will be encountered regarding the SDPJ's 
finalizing its coalition blueprint and subsequent policy 
consultations with other parties. 
  In the blueprint, the SDPJ seeks to clarify what caused it 
to 
leave the coalition alliance as well as who is to be held 
responsible. However, the party does not intend to demand the 
resignation of those held responsible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, chairman of the Watanabe </F>
faction in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, by an 
unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The leadership of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] plans to submit a no-confidence 
motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet. What is your 
opinion? 
  [Watanabe] The LDP leadership will move in that direction. 
In 
case the House of Representatives is dissolved, the LDP could 
not fight in general elections without spending money. I think 
that no bank would lend 10 billion yen to the LDP. The LDP is 
prepared to fight in the general elections. At the present 
stage, I would like to refrain from commenting on the LDP's plan 
to submit a no- confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to 
the Diet. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] You are advocating plans to forge a 
conservative-conservative coalition. 
  [Watanabe] I intend to talk candidly with any politicians 
who 
share my political belief about how to run the state and handle 
the political situation. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the ruling parties will 
propose to the opposition parties to hold talks to discuss how 
to form a new coalition government after the 1994 budget is 
passed in the Diet? 
  [Watanabe] There is a possibility of the ruling parties 
first 
holding talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ. If Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and 
the Democratic Socialist Party believe that they will be able to 
break the present political deadlock and carry out their 
policies after forging an alliance with the SDPJ, then the SDPJ 
would return to the ruling coalition. If those ruling parties 
have no intention of forging the alliance with the SDPJ, the 
SDPJ will not return to the ruling coalition. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will the ruling parties approach the LDP 
for an alliance if they fail to forge an alliance with the SDPJ? 
  [Watanabe] Yes, they will approach the LDP. Their approach 
may trigger debates in the LDP and stir up the LDP. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito, once said, "I am not sure whether we can reach a 
policy consensus with all members of the LDP." What do you think 
of his comment? 
  [Watanabe] If he thinks that the LDP is divided over 
policies, no alliance can be forged between the ruling parties 
and the LDP. A minority of LDP members share my political 
belief. If the LDP is unable to shape its own policy consensus, 
it will not be strange if the ruling parties seek an alliance 
with some LDP members who share their policies. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] If the Kono leadership rejects an offer 
from the ruling parties for policy consultations, how will you 
respond to the rejection? 
  [Watanabe] The LDP should hold intra-party discussion on the 
offer. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Mr. Watanabe, will you quit the LDP? 
  [Watanabe] I will not break away from the LDP so lightly. I 
need not leave the LDP. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Speaking on a television talk show, Mr. 
Ozawa has said, "If I am asked to apologize for what I have 
done, I will apologize." What is your comment? 
  [Watanabe] I take his statement as an indication of his 
eagerness to look for a way to break the current political 
deadlock and for a policy consensus after putting aside his 
personal feelings. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does the LDP have a blueprint for an 
LDP-SDPJ coalition? 
  [Watanabe] If there is no decision about who will become the 
prime minister and what the coalition will do, such a coalition 
would immediately collapse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary of </F>
Komeito (Clean Government Party), by a YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; 
date and place not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] So you are looking at two 
possibilities -- of conservatives [from the coalition parties] 
allying with conservatives [in the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP]) and of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
returning to the coalition government? 
  [Ichikawa] The natural course of action requires that we 
call on the SDPJ to return to the government first of all. But 
even when the SDPJ returns, there is the question of whether an 
agreement can be made on such policy issues as those concerning 
the consumption tax, defense, and diplomacy. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will you not be hesitant about 
collaborating with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone or 
former Deputy Prime Minister Micho Watanabe? 
  [Ichikawa] If there are people in the LDP who think the same 
way as we do on such pending issues as tax reform and who want 
to work together with the coalition, there is no reason to 
reject them. The ruling parties do not have much extra room to 
maneuver. As long as the 180 [Diet members] in the ruling 
parties remain unified as a "non-LDP" force, even if these 
parties cooperate with a part of the LDP, the core of the reform 
can be maintained. Consider it as only a phase in the process 
of the reorganization of the political world. You should not 
look at the matter from a narrow viewpoint. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is the possibility of the SDPJ 
returning to the government? 
  [Ichikawa] There is a strong possibility for that in view of 
the given conditions and situations. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the negotiations on their 
return to the government will go well? 
  [Ichikawa] Issues to be dealt with are -- in the order of 
difficulty -- tax reform, the DPRK (North Korean) issue, and the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin." If the SDPJ's intention to 
return to the government is clear and the issue of the Kaishin 
group is a barrier to their return, then that matter can be 
resolved. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will a voluntary resignation of the 
cabinet en masse be acceptable to you. 
  [Ichikawa] We of the ruling parties cannot say we are 
"happy" about it. But we interpret their request on the 
cabinet's resignation as an expression of their willingness to 
return to the government. We appreciate that point. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will the cabinet be overhauled completely? 
  [Ichikawa] This is something that needs to be done with 
people from the SDPJ and other people included and in a way 
which enables the multiple parties to gather around on the basis 
of policies. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will a reorganization be possible within 
the next two weeks of the remaining Diet session? 
  [Ichikawa] It is quite possible. But the situation can 
become explosive or fluid on the slightest motives. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the possible motives? 
  [Ichikawa] A no-confidence motion in the cabinet can be one. 
But it is extremely questionable if the LDP can go for it. It 
is equally questionable if the SDPJ can collaborate in it. If 
the LDP leadership pushes and goes ahead for it without proper 
justification, a fight over policy lines will erupt, and the 
party could break up. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you view the move for the LDP and 
the SDPJ to cooperate? 
  [Ichikawa] The differences in policies between them are too 
big. Besides, it [two parties' cooperation] cannot be accepted 
by the supporters of the SDPJ. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you intend to pursue negotiations 
with the SDPJ for their return to the government? 
  [Ichikawa] Once the ruling parties' policy on the tax reform 
issue is decided, we will have no choice but to approach the 
party to gain their understanding on that matter as well as in 
pursuit of the party's return to the government. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Is there a possibility of time passing and 
the Diet session closing with the government remaining a 
minority one? 
  [Ichikawa] If the conditions presented by the SDPJ for their 
return to the govlernment are too tough to swallow, the 
political situation can move in a direction away from what the 
SDPJ expected.

  [Text] The ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a poll of all House of 
Representative members 4-11 June to survey their views on 
raising the consumption tax rate (currently 3 percent), which 
has been a focal point in reforming the current tax system. The 
poll found that more than 60 percent of the 468 lower house 
members surveyed conditionally favored raising the consumption 
tax rate. They are believed to have favored raising the tax 
rate out of their judgment that the consumption tax rate has to 
be raised to prepare for a society of senior citizens and out of 
the need to secure financial resources to make up for fiscal 
shortfalls resulting from continued cuts in the income and 
resident taxes. They favored raising the consumption tax rate 
on condition that administrative reform is promoted and the 
current tax profit [ekizei] is abolished. Many of the lower 
house members, who conditionally favored raising the consumption 
tax rate, proposed raising it by 5 percent. Meanwhile, about 
one-fourth of the lower house members surveyed opposed raising 
the tax rate. 
  Asked how they will deal with a bill on raising the 
consumption tax rate if it is submitted to the Diet for 
deliberation, 295 lower house members answered, "We will 
conditionally vote for it," while 22 lower house members 
answered, "We will unconditionally vote for it." The number of 
those legislators represented more than 67.7 percent of the 
total legislators surveyed. Meanwhile, 124 lawmakers said, "We 
will vote against it," while 27 lawmakers said, "We have no 
position." 
  With regard to conditions cited by the representatives for 
favoring the raise of the consumption tax rate, 196 
representatives said, "A concrete goal must be set for 
administrative reform," while 110 representatives said, "The tax 
profit must be abolished." Eighty-six representatives said, "The 
financial resources of the local autonomous governments must be 
increased," while 66 representatives said, "Daily necessities 
including food must be excluded from taxation." 
  As reasons for opposing an increase in the consumption tax 
rate, some lower house members said, "A comprehensive taxation 
system must be introduced, the current unfair system must be 
redressed, and the tax profit must be abolished before the 
consumption tax rate is raised," while other lower house members 
surveyed said, "The debate should be held to discuss whether or 
not to raise the consumption tax rate three years later, when 
the economy is expected to recover." 
  By political party, among the ruling parties, one member 
each 
from the Japan New Party and Komeito said, "We oppose raising 
the consumption tax rate"; while three members from Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], two members from Komeito, and one member 
each from the Japan New Party, the New Party Mirai, the 
parliamentary group Kaishin, and the independent group said, "We 
have no position." An overwhelming majority of the lower house 
members surveyed said, "We conditionally favor raising the 
consumption tax rate." Two members from Sakigake [Harbinger 
Party] favored raising the tax rate, 20 members conditionally 
favored raising the tax rate, and no Sakigake members opposed 
raising the tax rate. 
  Meanwhile, 35 members Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] 
members "opposed" raising the consumption tax rate, while 33 
party "conditionally favored" raising the tax rate. This 
reveals that the SDPJ was still strongly reacting against 
raising the consumption tax rate. From the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], 107 members "conditionally favored" raising the tax 
rate, while 70 "opposed" raising the tax rate. All 15 Japan 
Communist Party members "opposed" raising the tax rate. 
  Asked about a proper percentage to be raised in the 
consumption tax rate, 76 lower house members who favored raising 
the consumption tax rate answered by citing a figure. 
Thirty-six lower house members cited "5 percent," 28 cited "7 
percent," and nine cited "6 percent." About 60 percent of them 
cited 5 or 6 percent, a figure falling short of the 7 percent 
envisioned by the national welfare tax plan. 
  A large number of the lower house members surveyed cited the 
administrative reform and the redress of the unfair tax system 
as their conditions for favoring an increase of the consumption 
tax rate. This indicates their strong belief that raising the 
tax rate should be curbed in anticipation of increased tax 
revenues that would come after the government cuts back its 
spending and the unfair tax system is redressed.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A top life insurance 
industry official Friday blasted a government report on postal 
insurance for proposing making postal life insurance more 
competitive with private-sector products. 
  Speaking in the capacity of chairman of the Life Insurance 
Association of japan, Toshiomi Uragami told reporters that the 
proposal runs counter to the law governing postal life insurance 
that limits services. 
  "This could help give more power to the bureaucracy," said 
Uragami, who is also president of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. 
  The report, prepared by a study group for the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications, says postal life insurance is 
serving to promote competition in the oligopolistic life 
insurance market. 
  Commenting also on a series of damage suits filed by 
variable 
life insurance policyholders against life insurance firms, 
Uragami said each life insurance company should have explained 
the feature of variable life insurance, and noted that the 
industry is reviewing a text on the subject for sales personnel. 
  Variable life insurance policies are investment-oriented 
policies that provide a return linked to an underlying portfolio 
of securities. 
  Variable life insurance was a big hit in the so-called 
bubble 
era in the late 1980s when a booming stock market held the 
promise of higher returns. 
  But with the stock market crumbling since, many 
policyholders 
facing huge losses have filed damages suits against life 
insurance firms.

  [Text] Permanent Secretary of the Communications Ministry 
Mahidon Chantharangkun said Thailand will maintain its old 
position at the second round of aviation talks with the United 
States on 28-29 June. Thailand will stick to its positions 
concerning the third and fourth airline freedoms, that is, at 
least 55 percent of through passenger traffic load and 70 
percent of cargo as conditions for the fifth freedom. The 
matter was discussed at the negotiation two years ago. 
  He said it is difficult to anticipate the U.S. position in 
the forthcoming negotiation. According to a most recent report, 
the U.S. Congress was not happy with its delegation in the 
previous talks, which gave in too much to the countries involved 
in the negotiations. Thailand therefore expects that this 
forthcoming round of talks will be tough, with the United States 
taking a tougher stand there being a possibility that Thailand's 
conditions will not be accepted. 
  The Thai delegation will be led by Sisuk Chantharangsu, 
director general of the Commercial Aviation Department. 
  In the previous round, both sides discussed the matter of 
principles, and reportedly the United States adopted a sincere 
and amicable position. The upcoming negotiations will deal with 
the details and Thailand will seek to know the U.S. response to 
its proposals. Thailand does not expect any discussions about 
flight routes or flight increases because this area should be 
dealt with only when an agreement has been reached in principle.

  [Excerpts] Thailand yesterday said it would follow the UN 
decision on proposed sanctions against North Korea but made 
clear its preference for a negotiated solution to Pyongyang's 
refusal to allow nuclear inspections. 
  "Thailand will follow the United Nations resolution," 
Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri said. "But we hope that the situation 
will be resolved through negotiations." [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Prasong confirmed that Thailand's 
ambassador 
to the UN in New York, Nit Phibunsongkhram, was in consultation 
with counterparts from other ASEAN states on the matter. 
  Thailand and ASEAN partners always follow the UN Security 
Council resolutions, a Bangkok-based Asian diplomat said. 
  But ASEAN member states "are not for the confrontational 
style of Western countries," the source added. 
  "Maybe we should give quiet diplomacy a chance. Methods of 
the West may not always be the best," the source said 
  Because of China's position, the UN Security Council is 
likely to find it more difficult than usual to forge a 
resolution on North Korea, the source added.

  [Text] European representation at security talks remains an 
open question with three positions now on the table, according 
to Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan. 
  Mr Surin, who was in Paris last week, said France held that 
the European Union should be represented by a so-called troika 
of former, current and pending presidents at the ASEAN Regional 
Forum (ARF) which Thailand will host on July 25. 
  Mr Surin met permanent secretary for foreign affairs 
Bertrand 
Dufoureq in what was the highest level Thai-French exchange in 
recent years. 
  The EU Commission on Asian Affairs, however, favoured 
representation by Germany and an official of the EU Commission, 
Mr Surin said. 
  Germany, which would by then have taken up the rotating 
presidency of the EU, wanted to be the community's 
representative, with backing by senior officials from Germany 
and Greece, he said. 
  "There is no conclusion on the issue. They can discuss this 
and inform us later," Mr Surin said, shortly after returning 
from a fleeting visit to Malaysia. 
  Senior officials preparing for the forum let it be known 
last 
month that Germany, which takes up the six-month presidency of 
the EU on July 1, was a likely candidate for EU representative. 
France would be represented at the forum if ASEAN accepts the 
Troika formula which normally has been the case for the annual 
post-ministerial conference featuring ASEAN foreign ministers 
and their dialogue partners. 
  The presidency of the EU turns in alphabetical order. France 
precedes Germany and Greece would follow. 
  France was interested in having a role in Southeast Asia and 
Indochina -- in terms of culture as well as business -- and knew 
cooperation with ASEAN was necessary to achieve this, Mr Surin 
said. 
  "All European countries, in fact, have their own policy on 
this region," he said. 
  The EU Union will be one of a total of 18 entities 
participating in the forum. The EU will do so as one of ASEAN's 
seven dialogue partners. 
  Six other dialogue partners also to attend are Australia, 
Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States. 
  Eleven other entities participating in the informal meeting 
at foreign minister level are the six ASEAN member states, 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, 
Thailand; their consultative partners China and Russia; and 
three "observer" states, Laos, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri says he will push 
to establish links between the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations and the South Asian regional grouping. 
  The minister said yesterday that as ASEAN chairman he would 
consult his counterparts at the ASEAN ministerial meeting in 
July in Bangkok on ways to set up ties between ASEAN and the 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. 
  Ties between the two groups were raised during talks between 
the Thai and Bangladesh foreign ministers in Dhaka at the 
weekend. 
  Bangladesh Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman told his 
counterpart that the SAARC would like to set up joint activities 
with ASEAN including economic and social aspects. 
  SAARC comprises Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and 
Sri Lanka, besides Bangladesh. 
  Sqn Ldr [squadron leader] Prasong returned from Dhaka 
yesterday after a two-day visit during which he cochaired a 
joint commission meeting with the Bangladesh foreign minister. 
  Thailand and Bangladesh called for increasing trade between 
the two countries and for the private sector to play a greater 
role in this. 
  Bangladesh has potential and is a promising market for Thai 
traders, especially in textiles, because of an abundance of 
labour and very high domestic demand for the product, Sqn Ldr 
Prasong quoted the Bangladesh foreign minister as saying. 
  Bangladesh called for Thailand to buy more products 
including 
urea fertiliser, paper, paper products, tobacco, tea and jute. 
  Two-way trade between the countries accounted for about $93 
million last year with a surplus of $53 million in favour to 
Bangkok. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong asked Bangladesh to ease measures against 
Thai trawers and fishermen illegally fishing in Bangladeshi 
waters. 
  Dhaka will conside Thailand's proposal to set up of a 
committee to solve this problem.

  [Text] The closure of the Khmer Rouge [KR] office in Phnom 
Penh will have a bad effect on Cambodia's attempts to reach 
national reconciliation, and will prolong the conflict between 
the Cambodian government and the guerrillas, Thailand's Foreign 
Minister, Prasong Sunsiri, said. 
  Responding to reporter's queries, Prasong said Cambodia 
should continue its attempt to bring back to the community the 
Khmer Rouge, who refused to participate in 1993 UN-organized 
election. 
  The Cambodian government has ordered the closure of the 
Khmer 
Rouge office in the capital, Phnom Penh, saying that it is 
uncertain of the guerrillas representative in the city. 
[sentence as published] 
  "Phnom Penh's order regarding the Khmer Rouge office clearly 
showed the government's outrage at the Khmer Rouge refusal to 
cooperate with it. However such closure should not happen, as 
the two sides are in the process of negotiation," Prasong said. 
  The office, which has only one staff, has seldom been in 
operation due to conflicts with the government. The government 
has not yet outlawed the guerrillas. A proposed bill to outlaw 
the group has been withdrawn temporarily pending the results of 
talks held last week in Phnom Penh. 
  The talks failed to reach any agreement on a ceasefire, 
reportedly prompting the Cambodian government to order the 
closure of the office. 
  "Hope to see immediate and lasting peace in Cambodia has 
been 
further diminished as the guerrillas will certainly be angry 
with the closure of its office," Prasong said.

  [Text] France is not ready to grant a Cambodian government 
request for arms to fight the Khmer Rouge. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday after a recent meeting 
with the French foreign affairs permanent secretary. 
  Surin added that Australia, which had also been approached 
by 
the Cambodian government, had made no decision on the matter and 
the United States was only interested in supporting military 
training in Cambodia. 
  Surin, who returned from an overseas tour, stopped over in 
France after he attended a meeting of ambassadors and 
counsellors in Morocco. He arrived in Bangkok from Kuala Lumpur 
yesterday. 
  Apart from narcotics suppression and the Cambodian conflict, 
Surin said the talks with French officials included discussion 
on SEA 10, a Southeast Asian grouping which includes the six in 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the three 
Indochinese nations and Burma.

  [Text] Kuwait has shown keen interests in employing more 
Thai workers to help in reconstruction of the country. Vice 
President of the Kuwaiti Parliament [Salei Yusuf Al Fathala] met 
Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Phaithun Kaeothong on 
Friday for talks on Thai labor in Kuwait. There are currently 
about 3,000 Thai workers in Kuwait. The country wishes to 
increase the number of Thai workers to 7,000, the same number 
employed in Kuwait before the Gulf war. The vice president of 
the Kuwaiti parliament asked Thailand to help urge Iraq to 
release Kuwaiti prisoners of war. Kuwait intends to cooperate 
more in Thailand in diplomatic, trade, and labor areas. Trade 
between the two countries last year amounted to 2,000 million 
baht. Kuwait has invested over 1,000 million baht in the 
petroleum business in Thailand. Kuwait has also invited 
Minister Phaithun to visit that country.

  [Text] The Export-Import Bank of Thailand says Chaiyaphon 
Rice Co must ask the Iraqi government to earmark funds which 
have not been frozen to pay interest every six months on a new 
rice contract. 
  The company, the authorised representative for the purchase 
of Thai rice for Iraq, had struck a deal for annual interest 
payments. 
  It says the contract will be guaranteed by the Iraqi central 
bank, which will open a letter of credit to ensure payment. 
  Further negotiations between the bank and the buying 
representative are set for today. 
  According to the deputy managing director of Ex-Im Bank, 
Somphan Iamrungrot, the company has proposed a two-year 
extension of interest payments, but the condition could not be 
accepted because of the risks of the transaction. 
  It could not be sure when the United Nations would release 
Iraqi assets. Mr Somphan learned that Iraq's Bank of 
International Settlements (BIS) has only US$100 million in hand, 
which may not be enough for the rice payment. 
  Iraq is set to buy about 500,000 tons of 10 percent and 15 
percent white rice worth about five billion baht from Thailand 
this year through Chaiyaphon Rice. 
  The Ex-Im Bank has been asked by Commerce Ministry to 
finance 
local exporters on the deal. 
  Phaibun Khuansongtham, the managing director of Chaiyaphon 
Rice Co, said he wondered why the bank has taken such a long 
time to examine the deal when Iraq's central bank has 
acknowledged payment. 
  He was also informed that the assets will be released by the 
end of next month and that it is urgent that the Thai Government 
makes a decision, as the released assets may not be earmarked 
for the rice. 
  The rice price will be quoted in line with market prices 
plus 
15 percent interest, which Mr Phaibun says is a risk worth 
taking. 
  Iraq still owes about 1.8 billion baht to Thai rice 
exporters, who sold about 200,000 tons of rice to Iraq before 
the Gulf War.

  [Text] Dhaka -- Bangladesh has turned down Thailand's 
request to increase joint fishing ventures, saying its marine 
resources were already depleted and it must conserve the 
remainder as much as possible, a senior Thai Fisheries 
Department official said yesterday. 
  Fisheries Deputy Director General Somsak Singhonka said 
there 
is only one joint venture fishing company. It initially had 10 
Thai boats, but had been reduced to seven as three of them sank 
in a storm. 
  Bangladesh has rejected a Thai request to replace the sunken 
boats. A request for more joint fishing ventures was also 
rejected, he said. 
  Somsak was speaking to THE NATION after attending a 
three-day 
meeting of the Thai-Bangladeshi Joint Commission in Dhaka which 
ended yesterday. 
  Leading Thai officials to Bangladesh was Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri, who co-chaired the meeting with his Bangladeshi 
counterpart A.S.M. Mustafizur Rahman. 
  Prasong, meanwhile, said he understood Dhaka may be 
reluctant 
to allow more Thai fishing activity in the Bay of Bengal because 
some Thais were caught illegally fishing in its territorial 
waters. 
  "Bangladesh has a strong policy to conserve its marine 
resource. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has informed me 
that her country wants to conserve this marine resource as much 
as possible. 
  "She said the country is considering the Thai request (for 
more joint ventures) but feels that the existing number of Thai 
boats under the concession are enough," Prasong said. 
  A reliable source said yesterday Bangladesh had at the 
last-minute gone back on an earlier agreement to set up of a 
joint working group on fisheries, agreed upon during a joint 
meeting of senior officials. 
  The Thai side had expected the proposed working group to 
help 
solve existing and future fisheries problems. 
  It was proposed that senior officials of the Thai and 
Bangladeshi fisheries departments join the working group so that 
they could directly talk to each other when problems occur. 
  Somsak confirmed that Bangladesh has changed its mind, but 
said the fisheries problems between Thailand and Bangladesh are 
less serious than those Thailand has with Vietnam and Burma and 
the working group is not necessary for the time being. 
  Prasong yesterday paid a courtesy call on Bangladeshi 
President Abdur Rahman Biswas and Prime Minister Zia. 
  During the meeting, the two parties agreed to increase 
bilateral trade which has been in favour of Thailand for many 
years. 
  Dhaka proposed that Thailand import more tea and jute 
products but the Thai side said Thailand is already a major 
producer of tea and jute. 
  The Thai delegation also offered to organize a training 
programme for Bangladeshi officials, particularly in the field 
of fisheries and human resource development.

the post together with the assistant secretary to the prime

<F P=106> [Report by Kokhet Chanthaloetlak and Watsana Nauam: "Wimon </F>
Puts the Country `at Ease'"] 
  [Text] The reputation of the Army was badly damaged by the 
May 1992 bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators on 
Ratchadamnoen Avenue. Certain officers were accused of ordering 
troops to brutally suppress protesters demanding the ouster of 
non-elected prime minister Suchinda Khraprayun. 
  After Gen Suchinda stepped down in disgrace shortly after 
the 
upheaval, several key military members were transferred to 
inactive posts, including former Army chief Itsaraphong 
Nunphakdi, ex-Air Force commander Kaset Rotchananin and former 
First Army Region commander Chainarong Nunphakdi. 
  Many "professional" officers were promoted to key positions, 
replacing "political" officers. Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon 
Wongwanit is one of the so-called professional officers, 
although he's a graduate of the once-powerful Class 5 of the 
Chunlachomklao Royal Military Academy and a classmate of Gen 
Suchinda and Gen Itsaraphong. 
  Gen Wimon has on several occasions reiterated his policy of 
non- interference in politics and has vowed to promote 
democracy. He clearly sides with the government in dealing with 
the current political situation precipitated by Chalat 
Worachat's hunger strike. 
  "A person who fasts must die. If he does not fast he will 
not die. Being fed with saline solution is not a fast, and 
(Chalat) will not die," Wimon said recently. 
  He has said the Army belongs to the King and the people. The 
Army is an agency of the government, so it must perform in line 
with government policy. 
  In his statement on June 7, he reiterated that the Army 
would 
side with the elected government of Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai. This does not only mean the Army will throw its weight 
behind the government, but also implies there are still 
"insidious power seekers" in the Army, and Wimon realizes the 
fact and thus has to make his stand clear to them. 
  These people want political changes which would be followed 
by transfers of officers who now hold powerful posts. 
  It has been reported that some "brokenhearted" officers -- 
those whose careers were affected by the 1992 upheaval -- remain 
uncomfortable about their future. 
  Many are officers who had close relationships with the old 
power clique in the Army. It's of little surprise then that 
these officers have felt uneasy since their bosses were 
transferred to inactive posts. 
  After being promoted to the Army's top post, Wimon did not 
sweep clean the Army as expected by observers. That would have 
been acceptable to Army personnel. 
  If Wimon did purge officers loyal to the old clique, there 
would have been chaos in the Army. Many officers who hold key 
combat posts, including commanders of divisions, regiments and 
battalions, remain loyal to the old clique. 
  In annual transfers under Wimon's command, only a few 
officers regarded as subordinates retaining loyalty to the old 
power clique have been transferred to inactive posts. Many 
have, indeed, even been promoted to important positions. 
  But the annual round of transfers in September will be 
another story. There are signs that there will be changes among 
commanders of combat units. Some officers loyal to the old 
clique have held key positions for too long because they have 
"immunity". And it's time for them to be transferred to 
inactive posts. 
  This would break a systematical inheritance of power set up 
by graduates of Class 5 four years ago. 
  When Suchinda was appointed prime minister, Itsaraphong 
succeeded him as Army chief. It was clear then that after 
Itsaraphong retired this year, the post of Army chief would go 
to Lt Gen Wirot Saengsanit, who will retire in 1996. 
  And after Wirot, the heirs apparent are Chainarong and then 
Samphao Chusi. Commanders of key combat units were also 
affected. Chainarong's colleagues from Class 11 were put in 
control of important combat units. 
  For soldiers, gratitude is an important professional virtue. 
It is no surprise then that many soldiers are still loyal to 
the old power clique that once rewarded them with key posts. 
  For soldiers, gratitude is an important professional 
virtue. It is no surprise then that many soldiers are still 
loyal to the old power clique that once rewarded them with key 
posts. 
  But in a recent reshuffle at the level of battalion 
commanders, which has not yet been publicly announced, there is 
a sign the best days of officers standing by the old clique are 
over, according to sources. 
  Earlier this year, sources in an intelligence unit said 
certain Army officers had tried to approach an opposition party 
leader, who was tipped to be a strong candidate to become the 
next prime minister. 
  The sources said they developed a decent relationship with 
the politician because they were backed by newspaper columnists 
close to the opposition party leader. 
  During the May crisis, one graduate of Class 5 was not 
involved in the brutal crackdown on protesters, but his career 
was nevertheless affected. He was transferred to an inactive 
post at the Office of the Permanent Secretary of Defence. He 
was then a favorite candidate to succeed Itsaraphong as Army 
chief when the latter retires this year. 
  The officer has wondered why he was targeted. His aides who 
were tipped to succeed him as Army commander were hurt too. The 
"power line" prepared for them had been cut and their way to the 
top blocked. 
  The plans for the post of Army chief to go from Suchinda to 
Itsaraphong, then Chainarong and Samphao, could not be realized. 
Lt Gen Chainarong is now commandant of the Institute of Army 
Academics. Although he still has a chance to return to an active 
post, his path is not smooth. 
  Chainarong's image has been tainted since the May upheaval. 
He's been accused of being directly involved in the bloodshed 
by ordering troops to open fire because he was commander of the 
First Army Region, which oversees the capital. 
  Since the May incident, there have been attempts to regain 
power by the old power clique, who were suspected to be involved 
in a spate of violence in the South and elsewhere in the country. 
  Sources in intelligence agencies said the violence was aimed 
at overthrowing the Chuan administration as soon as possible. 
This would open the way for them to regain power. 
  The old power clique comprises the people who used to have 
political power and certain "undisciplined" officers. 
  Certain officers believe that if former deputy Army chief 
Wirot, who is now deputy defence permanent secretary, comes back 
to succeed Gen Wimon, who is due to retire in 1995, the arranged 
power line would be in effect again. Wirot's reputation has not 
been tainted by the May 1992 events, but he was transferred to 
an inactive post because certain senior officers wanted to clean 
the Army of Wirot, a classmate of Suchinda and Itsaraphong. 
Senior officers also want to sever the line blocking the 
promotion of other officers. 
  It is justified to promote Wirot to be Army chief succeeding 
Gen Wimon because of his clean image. Wirot is due to retire in 
1996. 
  Such a promotion could be realized only when there are 
changes in political power. There must be a prime minister and 
a defence minister who would agree to such a move. 
  Certain powerful columnists are reportedly backing the old 
power clique, using their columns to justify campaigns to oust 
the government. 
  Although leaders of the Armed Forces have repeatedly vowed 
that they would not stage a coup, some groups of people still 
fear that other officers would turn to the outdated method of 
power seizure. 
  An opinion poll, conducted by Suan Dusit Teachers' College 
and publicized in May, showed that a lot of people disagree with 
military coups. The poll and Wimon's statement on June 7 have 
been regarded as a tool to stop the "underwater tide". 
  The old power clique can do nothing at the moment because of 
the people's strong opposition to military coups. They have 
opted to conduct underground campaigns, recently spreading a 
rumour that a group of officers had travelled to Hong Kong to 
discuss the possibility of staging a coup. 
  Officers who are also senators have tried to hurt 
relationships between the government and permanent officials, 
and between Chuan and Wimon. 
  They want Chuan to lose confidence in Wimon, and Wimon to 
have sour relations with the press. 
  But Wimon knows about the plans, and isn't about to fall 
into 
the trap.

<F P=106> [Interview with "Radical Social Critic" Sulak Siwalak by </F>
Kritsana Chaiyarat, place and date not given; under the "Who 
Will Trust the Thai Military" rubric] 
  [Text] Please comment on the origin of the Thai 
military and its role in Thai politics. 
  The Thai military emerged during the reign of King Rama V. 
At 
the time, both the military and civilians were duty-bound to 
fight against any foreign military invader. 
  At first, King Rama V only wanted the military to suppress 
internal rebels, but things changed after Thailand lost a war to 
France and had to give up part of its territory. During the 
reign of King Rama VI, a force of defence scouts was set up to 
balance the power of the military. 
  In 1932, King Rama VII was arrested by the military, an 
incident that led to the changing of Thailand's political system 
from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. 
  So the military has played the dominant role in the 
country since the reign of King Rama V? 
  Of course. And since 1952, the Thai military has virtually 
had its own state in Thailand. 
  What are the military's good points at present? 
  The military should only have one duty -- to protect the 
country. Its budget and personnel should be reduced. The Army 
preparatory school should only produce military personnel who 
want to be professional soldiers, not prime ministers. Many 
army generals forced out of command by the people are still 
alive. They're still playing golf and having a good time in 
Thailand. 
  The military is now very angry with political activist 
Chalat 
Worachat, who's on a death fast. It was the military that told 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai not to yield to Chalat's demands. 
  Do you think the military still wants to get involved 
In politics to solve any national crisis that arise? 
  Yes it does. This has been going on in Thai society since 
the time of ACM [Air Chief Marshal) P. Phibunsongkhram. The 
Thai school system was used to teach people to respect the 
military. Male students were told to cut their hair short like 
soldiers. Students are still required to stand in front of the 
flag polo at eight o'clock every morning. No other schools in 
the world make their students stand before the flag pole every 
morning. The practice is the military's idea. 
  How do the military and politics balance each 
other? 
  People must first realize that the military is a separate 
state in Thailand. It can do things normal people can't do. 
It's alleged that its members can do business with the Khmer 
Rouge and Burma. If you look around Bangkok, you'll see that 
many areas belong to the military. The military has its own 
"secret" budget and nobody knows how they spend the money. Thai 
military representatives overseas have a lot of money to spend. 
It's not fair for the citizens. I don't see why they should 
receive such a huge budget. 
  What in your opinion would constitute a "good" 
military? 
  One whose only duty was to protect the country. 
  If Chalat's hunger strike spins out of control, is it 
appropriate fro the military to be called out to solve the 
problem? 
  That would be very dangerous. It's already old fashioned to 
use force to quell a public uprising. In fact, this country has 
no need to maintain a large military. The military budget 
should be cut. A former deputy finance minister once told me he 
was very worried about the military budget because it was nearly 
impossible to examine military spending. 
  Does the present role and status of the military 
satisfy the people? 
  Not yet. The military doesn't like Chalat because it fears 
losing power if his demand for a new charter is honoured. The 
military is involved in many different kinds of trade. They 
have their own schools, hospitals, banks and overseas 
representatives. Most of the people don't know that the present 
charter was written by pro-military academics . 
  Will the Army ever become democratic? 
  No, not ever. Soldiers are soldiers and they have to listen 
to many levels of commanders. In a democracy, people have equal 
right to express their opinions in public. Soldiers in the 
lower ranks don't have the right to voice their opinions. They 
have to listen to their commanders. 
  What's your view on the military's role in Chalat's 
protest? 
  Army commander in chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit called Chalat a 
"madman". Chuan is not brave enough to implement Chalat's 
demands because the prime minister is afraid of the military. 
However, the military shouldn't become involved in the current 
political situation. 
  Is there still a chance the military could stage a 
coup? 
  As long as people are still not aware of their rights in a 
democracy, there is the chance the military could stage a coup 
at any time. At present, the military doesn't want to be too 
visible because the people lost faith in the Army during the 
1992 bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. 
  Aren't you afraid of being hurt by the military because 
of your comment? 
  Everybody has a sense of fear, but I have to speak out 
against things that are incorrect because it's my duty to 
protect democracy in our country. 
  How do you feel when the military issues statements 
hitting back at your comments? 
  It's good for the military to retaliate with words. It's 
much better than ordering their men to beat me up. I don't 
believe this is a barbaric era. If they were to use barbaric 
methods against me, I could end up dying like a dog along the 
roadside.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armed Forces Spokesman Lieutenant General </F>
Anuson Kritsanaserani by Watsana Nanuam, date and place not 
given; under the "Who Will Trust the Thai Military" rubric] 
  [Text] Military leaders reiterate that there will be 
no more coups, so why does the public still believe a coup could 
occur? 
  In the past, it seemed to the public that the military 
overthrew democratic governments. These days, the military 
worries whenever people suggest it will stage a coup. None of 
us thinks about coup; we don't want to talk about coups. Every 
time there's a rumour, we try to find out where it originated. 
If you see any military unit mobilizing, please inform us. 
  There will always be rumours about coups, because of fear 
and 
the stock market. Investors in the stock market are always 
watching politics and the military. They check out information 
from several sources, in particular the press. 
  If you have any such negative information, you should inform 
the military. I can assure you that there will be no coup. The 
military is not prepared (to stage a coup). According to my 
information, I can assure you that there will be no coup. But 
you can't say a Boeing will never again crash. I can assure you 
that at present there will be no coup. 
  Army chief Wimon Wongwanit on June 7 warned Army 
officers not to listen to certain instigators. Did he want to 
warn certain people not to act wrongfully? 
  The Army commander in chief wants the country to be 
peaceful. 
He wants his subordinates to be disciplined. He wants to warn 
his subordinates not to cause unrest. But I don't know whether 
he has any information about a possible threat. 
  You can't call soldiers opportunists. At present, we are 
professional soldiers. We know what the people don't want the 
military to do; we know that from opinion polls. 
  We will perform in line with what the people want. We 
consider ourselves the people's army. If we act against the 
people's will, we'll be viewed as dictators. We have to adjust 
our attitude to match the public's. We will not get involved in 
politics. If we take sides, the people will think military rule 
has returned; we have to be neutral. 
  But the press always asks us about politics. Officers from 
the supreme commander to commanders of the Armed Forces don't 
want to talk about it. But when asked, they have to say 
something. 
  The supreme commander and commanders of the Armed Forces 
support the government. We have to back the government because 
it's legitimate. The government is elected by the people. If 
we say we don't support the government, the people will be angry 
at the military. We don't want the people to hate the military, 
so we have to support the government. We don't want to 
criticize anything, including the government. 
  If there was violence in the streets, would the 
military stay idle? 
  The military has to listen to the government. The prime 
minister, as director of internal security, has the power to 
call out the military and police. 
  The prime minister, who is elected by the people, knows what 
is right or wrong. We have to obey his policies. 
  The military will not get involved if there is no order 
from the prime minister? 
  That's right. We don't want to be offside. If we do 
anything without orders, the people will be watching us. 
  What did you do when reports arose recently that 
certain military officers had met to form a plot? 
  The supreme commander called everyone together and asked 
whether anyone knew anything. I told him some officers had gone 
to Hong Kong. You should know that when there are holidays, our 
officers like to go to Hong Kong: we play golf and our wives 
and children go shopping. This is a personal matter. 
  What are "professional soldiers"? 
  We are soldiers; we want to be soldiers; we receive a salary 
from the military. We have to be disciplined and do what we are 
ordered to do by our superiors. We don't want to repeatedly say 
`we are professional soldiers and we will not become involved in 
politics'. We have to act, not just talk. 
  Did the military survey public opinion about coups? 
  No, not directly. It would be like someone asking you how 
many wives you have. People don't want to answer that kind of 
question. We have regularly used public opinion polls to find 
out what people want us to do.

  [Text] The Senate meeting convened at Parliament this 
morning at 0935. The meeting considered the house-approved 
draft copyright bill. A number of senators debated in support 
of the bill saying that it will contribute to developing the 
national economy to be in line with the world economic 
situation. They said this will lead to greater development of 
the country's economy because it will also result in expansion 
of trade and industry. The draft bill will encourage Thai 
people to be enthusiastic in using new and modern inventions. 
  Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said that the 
draft copyright bill will provide protection for data work and 
actors' achievements. Regarding computer programs, over which 
many parties have expressed concerns, they will be protected by 
the existing law. 
  After a considerable period of debate, the meeting decided 
to 
accept in principle the draft bill before being passed for 
further consideration by the commission. The meeting was 
adjourned at 1210. 
  Earlier, it took the House of Representatives three weeks to 
deliberate and approve this draft copyright bill.

<F P=106> ["Page 5 Report" by Sathit Manatsurakun: "Water Diversion </F>
From Salween River To Replenish Phumiphon Dam -- Many Questions 
Need To Be Answered"] 
  [Summary] "It appears that many obstacles face the program 
to build seven dams in the Salween River basin in the 
Thai-Burmese border area to draw water from branches of the 
Salween River to branches of the Chao Phraya River to replenish 
the Phumiphon dam in order to feed 22 central region provinces, 
including Bangkok. 
  "In addition to opposition from the local people, which 
already has started in some areas, the government program will 
have to face scrutiny by private development organizations, 
student environmental groups, and academics who have demanded 
fair distribution of resources. The obstacles will be just as 
intense as those found against the efforts to build other dams. 
  "The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand [EGAT] has 
been assigned by the government to make a feasibility and 
environmental impact study of the program, which involves the 
construction of at least seven dams. 
  "They are: the Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project in Mae Sot 
District, Tak Province; the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project in Mae 
Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Nam Pai-Mae Taeng Project in Pai 
District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Ngao-Mae Tun Project in the area 
where Sop Moei Subdistrict, Mae Hong Son and Tha Song Yang 
District, Tak Province merges; the Lower Nam Pai-Mae Chaem 
Project in Muang District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Moei-Mae Tun 
Project in Mae Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Salween-Mae Taeng 
Project in Burma north of Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai. 
  "It is estimated that the seven projects will be able to 
divert 6 billion cubic meters of water to Phumiphon Dam. 
  "Because the program will involve drawing water from 
international waterways for domestic use, the program originator 
has to employ 'offensive public relations' as well as tactics to 
push ahead its program on the basis of international 
geopolitical factors. 
  "According to a source in EGAT's Phumiphon Dam Replenishment 
Project working team, Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's 
Office Sawit Phothiwihok, who is in charge of EGAT, has a policy 
to push ahead the program in three ways: 
  "First, the study for the projects which are located in 
Thailand, such as the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project, can start 
promptly. The project is located about 600 meters from the bank 
of the Moei River on the Thai-Burmese border. A Thai-UK treaty, 
signed while Burma was a British colony, stipulates that the 
banks of the Salween and Moei Rivers serves as the border, with 
the two rivers being neutral territory. Therefore, it should be 
no problem to pump water from the Moei River that flows into 
Huai Khanaeng Khito in the high tide season. 
  "Second, on the project which is located in the area 
straddling the Thai-Burmese border -- the Nam Moei-Mae Tun -- an 
agreement must be reached with Burma to enable Thailand to seek 
loans confidently from international financial institutions and 
to ensure that there will be no problem with the ethnic minority 
groups waging a liberation war nearby. 
  "Third, Thailand should not ask Burma to permit it to study 
the projects located in Burmese territory, such as the Upper 
Salween Project, unless Burma wants such projects implemented in 
order to sell water and electricity to Thailand. Only under 
these conditions should Thailand negotiate with Burma on a 
government-to-government level. 
  "The source said: `This policy was reached after considering 
the question: what would we do if Burma asks to conduct a study 
on the Chao Phraya River basin?' 
  "In any event, it appears that the EGAT will choose to 
implement more simple projects based on engineering and economic 
considerations first." 
  The EGAT organized a seminar recently to gauge reaction to 
two projects -- the Mae Lamao and Huai Khanaeng projects -- on 
which it already conducted preliminary studies. The people who 
will be displaced by the projects clearly opposed the 
construction, while academics and private development 
organizations made many observations. 
  "The seven private development organizations which 
participated in the seminar made the following proposals: 1. a 
public hearing should be conducted regarding water needs and 
resource management in the Chao Phraya River basin; 2. the study 
on environmental impact should be expanded to cover the Salween 
River basin as well; 3. an independent committee comprising 
specialists, local leaders, and representatives of private 
development organizations should be formed to monitor the 
environmental impact. The committee should participate in every 
stage of the projects until after completion of project 
construction."

  The dam is 60 meters high. It will dam Mae Lamao stream 
about 15 km from where it merges with the Moei River in Mae 
Lamao National Forest Reserve in Mae Sot District, Tak Province. 
It will be located about 120 km west of the Tak provincial 
town. The reservoir will inundate 4,190 rai of land and contain 
94.3 million cubic meters of water. The project cost will be 
5,342 million baht. It will irrigate 18,000 rai of farmland and 
divert 356 million cubic meters of water through a tunnel to 
Phumiphon Dam 
<H5>  Huai Khanaeng Project </H5>
  The dam will dam Huai Khanaeng Khitoe stream about 600-1,600 
meters from where it merges with Moei River. The exact size and 
site of the project is still under study. It will be located in 
Mae Ramat District, Tak Province. The reservoir will encompass 
about 1,400 rai and will divert 600-800 cubic meters of water to 
Phumiphon Dam. The project is estimated to cost about 5,068 
million baht. [end box]

  [Text] Last week, China claimed that Tu Chinh or Wan An 
area was a part of its territory in the Nansha [Spratly] 
Archipelagoes. Regarding this issue, the spokesperson for the 
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry released a statement rejecting this 
illegal claim and maintained that Tu Chinh is a region well 
within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. 
  Recently, Mr. (Tilaz Dosel) of the Southeast Asia Research 
Institute in Singapore, quoted in his thesis entitled: 
"Vietnam, a New Oil and Gas Exporter in Asia," as saying that 
China always violates Vietnam's sovereignty. [sentence as 
heard] Mr. (Tilaz Dosel) said: In May 1992, China allowed the 
Crestone Energy Corporation of the United States to explore oil 
and gas in an area of 15,610 square meters which is called by 
China as North Wan An-21, but in fact this area lies in 
Vietnam's territory, adjoining the Big Bear Oil Field. In 
September 1992, China sent four geology survey and drilling 
ships to operate in the Tonkin Gulf, about 150 km offshore 
Vietnam, where Vietnam has granted license to (Idemicfield) 
Company of Japan to explore. In 1993, China's ships intruded 
into the 6th lot of Vietnam, where BP Company of Britain was 
licensed for exploration. 
  The area that China allowed the Crestone Company to explore 
is the 133d lot which the Conoco Company of the United States 
was asking for Vietnam's approval to exploit. 
  Mr. (Tilaz Dosel) also mentioned that Vietnam has many a 
time 
negotiated with its neighboring countries to settle the dispute 
over its sea territory. He said that China has many times 
violated Vietnam's sovereignty in the Tu Chinh area.

  [Text] As reported earlier, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet and his Russian Counterpart V. Chernomyrdin signed in 
Moscow Thursday a treaty on principles of bilateral relations. 
During an official friendship visit to Russia by the Vietnamese 
Government leader from 15 June, the two sides also signed other 
important agreements laying new grounds for further development 
of the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Russia. 
At this connection, the Voice of Vietnam has this to say: 
  Russia is one of the big countries in the world with 
developed agriculture and industries and great potentials in 
oil, gas, machinery, and means of transport. In recent years, 
Russia has been confronted with a number of social economic 
difficulties such as the decrease of economic growth, inflation, 
unemployment. To overcome this situation, the Russian 
leadership has stepped up its relations with foreign countries 
while solving its domestic problems. To get this done, Russia 
has focussed on nations in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia. 
  The Russian foreign minister, in his talks on 15 June with 
visiting Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam said: Russia 
and Vietnam share many common interests. Vietnam is Russia's 
friend in Asia. On this occasion, Senior Lieutenant General 
Commander (Lindegrav) said: No reason for Vietnam and Russia 
forget each other. [sentence as heard] 
  At present, the two countries are determined to restore, 
consolidate, and develop their bilateral cooperation. This 
determination has been manifested through a series of agreements 
and treaties signed on 16 June. Besides the treaty on the 
principles of bilateral relations, Vietnam and Russia also 
signed agreements on investment; on economic scientific and 
technical cooperation; in agriculture, industry; and on 
cooperation in fishery. These documents are new foundations for 
Vietnam and Russia to develop long term cooperation for mutual 
benefits on the principles of equality, and at the same, basis 
for them to overcome obstacles on mechanism and forms of 
cooperation in recent past. 
  The Russian prime minister, in the talks, assured the 
Vietnamese prime minister that the two countries of Vietnam and 
Russia have a fine traditional relationship. With the newly 
signed documents, the two countries should bring into full play 
this fine relationship.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet by </F>
unidentified press correspondents aboard the airplane carrying 
him home from Moscow on 18 June -- Kiet's remarks are recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Could you discuss the significance 
of your visit and its most successful aspects? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] My visit was to help create conditions for 
renewed cooperation between Vietnam and these countries. We 
renewed and restored all the relations we had in the periods 
from 1992 to early 1993 and from 1993 to early 1994. Vietnam 
and these countries signed a number of agreements. We signed 
with the Russian Federation a new treaty to replace the old one, 
which had been signed with the former Soviet Union. We 
successfully surmounted this hurdle. The new treaty, though 
based on the same old friendly spirit, does not follow the old 
pattern of doing business. The two sides now will conduct 
business in accordance with the new principles of relations. 
This will create new advantages for us to expand our friendly 
cooperation. During this visit, our businessmen and officials 
from various sectors were able to get in touch with the real 
situation. Through their exchanges of views and observations, 
they saw with their own eyes many potentials more substantively. 
This was a good opportunity for us to rebuild our relations. 
  [Correspondent] How far did Vietnam and these countries 
discuss those difficulties that obstructed their relations? And 
is there any prospect that those treaties and agreements already 
signed between Vietnam and these countries during your visit 
will soon be implemented? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] They raised their demands with us and also 
resolved those issues we raised with them such as the question 
of debt liquidation, the transportation issue, and the question 
of ensuring synchronization for the working apparatus of both 
sides. All these issues will be resolved on a step-by-step 
basis. For instance, Kazakhstan, a land-locked country, asked us 
for cooperation in ground and air transportation. But we were 
only interested in railroad cooperation. 
  This time the two sides [Vietnam and Russia] signed a new 
treaty to replace the old one signed with the former Soviet 
Union. From now all, all new agreements will be based on the new 
principles laid down in this treaty. 
  Based on the spirit of this new treaty, we will review 
various old agreements to adjust and revise inappropriate 
provisions. Both sides will continue to discuss issues 
concerning the avoidance of double taxation and measures to 
promote investment protection while strengthening cooperation in 
the implementation of the treaty. 
  [Correspondent] Will the establishment of direct 
relationships between Vietnam and the CIS states be more 
advantageous than the relationship between Vietnam and those 
republics of the former Soviet Union in the past? 
  [Vo Van Kiet] In the past, we made contact with various 
Soviet Republics through the former Soviet Union, now we have 
established direct relationships with the CIS states as well as 
with the Russian Federation. This has created favorable 
conditions for us to directly get in touch and closely cooperate 
with these independent states. 
  Dear friends: the Prime Minister also answered many other 
questions asked by newsmen, including those issues related to 
Vietnamese workers abroad, measures and orientations for 
cooperation with these friendly states to reorganize Vietnamese 
workers and provide jobs for them, plans to help and create 
favorable conditions for them to return home at the end of their 
contracts, and appropriate measures to deal with those 
Vietnamese workers who violate the law of the host countries.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 20 -- Hailing the success of Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet's recently concluded visits to Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan and Russia, the daily NHAN DAN today frontpages an 
article saying that the visits have opened a new era for the 
consolidation, development and expansion of the multi-faceted 
cooperation between Vietnam and these countries. 
  The paper confirms that the visits are an important land 
mark 
in the traditional friendship relations between Vietnam and the 
former Soviet Unions' republics in the past and the Commonwealth 
of Independent State (CIS) at present. 
  The paper continues: "After major political changes which 
led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the relationship 
and cooperation between Vietnam and the republics of the former 
Soviet Union were sometime at a pause due to great difficulties 
faced by these republics". However, the paper goes on, it could 
be affirmed that after Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visits the 
mutual understanding, the friendship and cooperation for 
development on the basis of principles of equality, mutual 
benefits between Vietnam and Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russian 
Federation have been enhanced. 
  The paper points out that during the talks and meeting with 
Prime Minister Kiet, and leaders of the governments and 
parliaments of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia spoke highly of 
the achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in their 
cause of renovation as well as Vietnam's widely-opened foreign 
policies. 
  Following the improvement of relations with neighbouring 
countries, Southeast Asian, Northeast Asia and West European 
countries, Cuba and South Asian countries, the recent visits are 
new achievements of Vietnam external relation field. It vividly 
proves that Vietnam's foreign policy -- to be friend with all 
nations striving for peace, independence and development -- is 
correct and consistent. 
  Replying the daily NHAN DAN's question on the results of his 
current visits to Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia, Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet said: 
  "The major achievement is friendship which has created 
conditions to expand new cooperative ties between Vietnam and 
other countries. In the past, Vietnam had relations with these 
countries, but from now on such relations would be further 
developed. From long- standing traditional relations, we have 
created conditions for the establishment of new relations and 
fine cooperation. We have strong point of goods which these 
countries need. Vietnam is implementing its renovation while 
Russia is implementing its reform. Both sides have demand on 
new relations. Vietnam and the CIS have capabilities to 
cooperate with each other for a long time".

  [Text] Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has concluded 
his official visit to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia 
successfully. Following is our radio review on results of the 
visit. 
  Vietnam has traditional friendship and cooperation with 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia, and other republics of the former 
Soviet Union. After political changes that lead to the collapse 
of the former Soviet Union, relations between Vietnam and 
members of the former Soviet Union were suspended because these 
countries met with numerous difficulties. 
  The first visit to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia by the 
Vietnamese prime minister has breathed a new life into the 
traditional relations between Vietnam and these countries. 
  After the visit, the mutual understanding, friendship, and 
cooperation have been developed in the principles of equality 
and mutual benefit. It is worthy of note that during the visit, 
Vietnam and Russia signed four important agreements, including 
the treaty on the principle of friendly relations between the 
two countries. The treaty is a foundation for the restructuring 
of cooperation to make relations between the two countries 
develop effectively. 
  On this occasion, ministers, vice ministers, and businessmen 
who accompanied the prime minister exchanged views with their 
Russian counterparts to study the market and the possibility of 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Following the visit, ministries, branches, and enterprises 
of 
Vietnam and Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia will work out 
concrete plans for more effective cooperation. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said upon his return home from 
Moscow that Vietnam has resumed its friendship with members of 
the Commonwealth of the Independent States on the basis of new 
relations.

  [Text] Following is the report on the conference to review 
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' [UNHCR] five 
years of work on refugee program in Vietnam. 
  The conference to review the five years of work under the 
repatriation program for refugees were held on Friday and 
Saturday in Haiphong by the UNHCR and the Ministry of Labor, War 
Invalids, and Social Affairs. The conference was attended by 
the representatives of the interior, foreign and other 
ministries, representatives of 35 provinces and cities 
nationwide which have been involved in the program. 
  Over the past five years, the Vietnamese Government, with 
the 
assistance of UNHCR and international community, have received 
more than 62,000 voluntary repatriates, and helped them in 
bringing their lives back to normal and learning a trade to 
support themselves. Today, the UNHCR and the ECIP [EC 
Integration Program] have sponsored nearly 200 job training 
centers in Vietnam for returnees. Since June 1992, ECIP was 
expanded to 18 provinces and cities throughout the country with 
total expenditure set at $130 million. 
  Addressing the conference, UNHCR representative Mr. 
Christopher Carpenter highly valued the goodwill, humanitarian 
policy, and great effort made by the Vietnamese Government in 
helping returnees to settle down in their homeland. By the end 
of 1995, the UNHCR is prepared to receive more than 52,000 
Vietnamese voluntary repatriates still living in camps in 
foreign countries.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA June 19 -- An agreement on a USD [U.S. 
dollars] 100 million credit to Vietnam was signed in Bangkok on 
June 16 between representatives of 14 Thai and foreign banks and 
several international financial organizations and a 
representative of Vietnam. 
  With this loan, for the first time Vietnam has opportunity 
to 
mobilize commercial fund from international private capital 
market. The five-year credit carries a two-and a half year grace 
period and repayment is to be made every six months with an 
interest bases on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) 
plus 2.25 percentage points. 
  This credit will be used for the development of electricity, 
cement and production in Vietnam. 
  Present at the signing ceremony were Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai, Thai Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanahemin, 
governor of the Vietnam State Bank Cao Sy Khiem. 
  Addressing the event, Thai finance minister pointed to the 
importance of this event, saying that `it paves the way for 
Vietnam's further access to international financial market'. 
  He praised the achievements Vietnam recorded during its 
renovation process, and stressed: `In the past few years since 
the adoption of the `Doi Moi' policy, reform efforts undertaken 
by the Government of Vietnam have yielded impressive results. 
This is amply illustrated by the fast growth of the domestic 
economy, lower inflation, healthier external balances and 
strengthened international reserves position. Five years ago, 
few people imagined that Vietnam would reach the present stage 
of development in such a short span of time....Vietnam's 
take-off process has been irrevocably put in motion and the 
future course is very promising'. 
  For his part, the governor of the Vietnam State Bank, Mr. 
Khiem said: `The signing of this loan syndication marks a 
significant achievement in our effort to gain access to 
international market. In tandem, it also signifies the 
transformation of Bangkok into a funding centre whereby Thai and 
foreign banks as well as finance companies may come together and 
syndicate loans of this nature in support of other countries. 
From now on, through this market, Vietnamese financial 
institutions as well as enterprises are given an opportunity to 
mobilize funds needed for the development of the economy'. 
  Addressing the event, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
said: 
`This loan agreement marks a new era which sees the commercial 
financial market effectively opened for the Socialist Republic 
of Vietnam. It is remarkable that within a short period of a 
few years after Vietnam has re-oriented its economy towards the 
market system, Vietnam is now being fully reintegrated into the 
international community. 
  `The successful conclusion of this first loan syndication 
for 
Vietnam under the leadership roles of both the Exim [Export- 
Import] Bank and Krung Thai Bank has clearly demonstrated that 
my government has full confidence in the Vietnamese leadership 
and is determined to assist Vietnam in her reconstruction effort 
in every way possible'.

  [Text] Today, the National Assembly held its work in the 
conference hall to pass the bill on the transfer of rights on 
land usage under the direction of National Assembly Vice 
Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan. 
  At the beginning of the session, Finance Minister Ho Te read 
a report compiling National Assembly deputies' views on the 
bill. Then, Ly Tai Luan, deputy head of the National Assembly 
Legislative Committee presented the full text of the revised 
bill on tax levied on the transfer of rights on land usage after 
receiving National Assembly deputies' opinions. 
  The bill on the transfer of rights on land usage consists of 
seven chapters with 29 articles. The National Assembly 
continued to contribute opinions before passing each chapter. 
  In the morning session, the deputies contributed many 
opinions on some articles, especially article eight regulating 
tax rates for the transfer of agriculture land -- particularly 
rice growing land -- for other purposes. Somebody suggested 
raising the tax rate from 40 percent to 50 percent in order to 
protect the decreasing amount of agriculture land. However, 
somebody else proposed that the tax rate for the transfer of 
agriculture land to build industrial projects should be reduced 
because a high tax would discourage entrepreneurs from building 
industrial projects in rural areas. Some opinions suggested 
that the National Assembly should only regulate a tax scale and 
the government and the National Assembly Standing Committee are 
empowered to set concrete tax rates for each projects built in 
rural areas. 
  In the afternoon, after the Law Drafting Committee amended 
some articles as suggested by the deputies, the National 
Assembly passed the entire bill on the tax levied on the 
transfer of rights on land usage. Also in the afternoon 
session, National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy reported 
on Comrade Mai Thuc Lan's application to resign from the 
positions of member of the National Assembly Standing Committee 
and head of the National Assembly's Economic and State Budget 
Committee for other official duty. The National Assembly voted 
in secret on Comrade Mai Thuc Lan's application. 
  Tomorrow, the National Assembly will have an all-day break. 
On Monday, it will continue its work in the conference hall.

fifth session on June 17 passed the Labour Law with 326 (out of 
332) votes in favour. 
  The Labour Law, the first of its kind in Vietnam, includes 
12 
chapters and 198 articles. To ensure the interest of both 
employees and employers, the law includes provisions on jobs, 
job training, labour contracts and collective labour agreements, 
wages, working and rest hours, labour disciplines, material 
responsibilities, labour safety, woman and juvenile labour, 
local employees at foreign enterprises and foreign labour in 
Vietnam, and so on. The law also stipulates such issues as 
social insurance, trade unions and their roles, labour disputes, 
state management on labour, state labour inspection and 
punishment for labour law breaking. 
  The chapter on settlement of labour disputes including the 
issue of strike caused hot discussions. The law provides that 
strike shall be decided by the executive committee of the trade 
union at grassroots level with more than half of its secret 
votes or signatures in favour. The law seriously prohibits any 
acts of violence causing damage to machinery and equipment and 
other properties of the enterprises, and public disorders during 
the strike. Article 174 stipulates that no strike shall be 
allowed at public service enterprises and major enterprises 
essential to the national economy or national security and 
defence listed by the Vietnamese Government.

<F P=106> [By Peter Gill and Bill Pheasant] </F>
  [Text] Indonesia's ambassador, Mr. Sabam Siagian, has 
warned that Australia could become a "stagnant, inward-looking, 
sulking" country, just as the federal government is embracing 
its northern neighbor in a new, closer relationship. The 
comments are a direct challenge to the government's efforts to 
move Australia closer to Asia, and drew a sharp response from 
the minister for foreign affairs, Senator Evans. 
  Mr. Siagian, speaking to a group of business leaders in 
Melbourne, said cooperative ventures would help Indonesia become 
a "modern, outward-looking country", but cooperative linkages, I 
believe, are also beneficial for Australia. "At least they are 
helpful to overcome the tendency to remain an isolated, 
comfortable island of western civilization down under, thus 
becoming a stagnant country." 
  "A stagnant, inward-looking, sulking Australia definitely is 
not in the interests of a dynamically growing Indonesia." In 
response, Senator Evans strongly denied Australia was stagnant 
or sulking. Through a spokeswoman, he said last night: "It looks 
like either the reporter or Sabam got his tenses mixed up: we 
are no longer stagnant and inward-looking, and we have never 
been sulking." 
  The tough critique by Mr. Siagian came as Senator Evans was 
warmly talking up a new relationship with Indonesia in response 
to a parliamentary committee report on the relationship between 
the two countries. Senator Evans said sensitivities in the 
relationship would remain over issues such as human rights, but 
closer ties were manifest in events such as a big trade and 
cultural promotion scheduled this month in Jakarta. Eight 
ministers, including the prime minister, Mr. Keating -- who has 
invested much of his foreign policy credibility in Australia's 
relationship with Indonesia -- will attend the Australia Today: 
Indonesia '94 exercise. 
  The significance of Mr. Siagian's comments yesterday are the 
reflection they contain on the success the federal government 
has achieved to date in its quest for a closer relationship with 
Asia. Mr. Siagian was speaking at the launch of an association 
between the Australian legal firm Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher 
with Makarim &amp; Taira S, a leading corporate law firm and 
trade 
consultancy in Jakarta: "I do hope that this cooperative venture 
between the two legal firms will help in some way in 
establishing a good relationship between our two countries, but 
also provide a significant contribution to the increasingly 
solid ballast as an underpinning for the expanding and deepening 
relationship between Indonesia and Australia." 
  Earlier, Senator Evans told parliament: "We are poised to 
enter a new phase in our relations [with Indonesia]." 
  "We can build on our gains so far, and we must take 
advantage 
of the momentum for taking forward the relationship which now 
exists." 
  A senior lawyer with Makarim &amp; Taira S, Mr. Nono 
Makarim, 
told the assembled lawyers and company directors that Australia 
needed to learn from Japanese economists such as Saburo Okita 
that industrialized countries had to leave basic manufacturing 
to developing countries. 
  Mr. Makarim said Indonesian government and business leaders 
had adopted the ideas of Saburo Okira, "who said 'developed 
countries ... if you want to continue growing, go in the 
direction of the sophisticated industries, of the 
technology-intensive industries, and leave the simple industries 
for the developing countries'. That was very attractive and 
they believed that." 
  Mr. Makarim warned that Australia's protection of its 
manufacturing industries could affect the bilateral relationship 
between the two nations.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- A South-North Korean 
summit is likely to be held in the near future as South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam accepted North Korean President Kim 
Il-song's proposal to that effect. 
  Kim Il-song conveyed his willingness to meet Kim Yong-sam in 
the not-too-distant future without any conditions through former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived in Seoul Saturday after 
a four- day visit to Pyongyang. 
  Presidential press secretary Chu Ton-sik said that President 
Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish to "meet 
President Kim Yong-sam at any time, anywhere without conditions 
at an early date," told Carter that he would accept the offer 
"without any hesitation." 
  Carter conveyed Kim Il-song's verbal message while briefing 
the South Korean president on the results of his visit to 
Pyongyang. 
  As to Kim Il-song's suggestion that "the earlier the summit 
came the better it would be," Kim Yong-sam expressed his assent, 
saying, "I myself think that the South-North Korean summit would 
be better the earlier it came." Kim asked Carter to convey his 
position to Kim Il-song, Chu said. 
  Barring any unexpected developments, a South-North summit is 
likely to occur in the near future for the first time in the 
half-century of national division, now that the two top leaders 
have said they were willing to hold an "unconditional summit 
meeting at any time and at any place." 
  The meeting could take place either in Seoul, Pyongyang or 
at 
a third location. 
  Once a summit was materialized, the nuclear and other major 
issues pending between the two sides could be discussed and 
epochal momentum provided to progress in South-North relations. 
  South and North Korea are expected to have working-level 
contacts soon to discuss details related to a summit meeting. 
  "There will be working-level contacts as President Kim 
Yong-sam has given an express reply to President Kim Il-song's 
proposal by saying he would meet the Northern leader at any time 
and at any place," spokesman Chu said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea on Saturday 
proposed to meet North Korea on June 28 to discuss procedures 
for the inter-Korean summit. 
  The proposal, contained in a message from South Korean 
Deputy 
Premier Yi Yong-tok to his North Korean counterpart Kang 
Song-san, said that a three-member delegation from each side led 
by a deputy premier-level official should meet at the truce 
village of Panmunjom at 10 A.M. 
  The decision to propose the contact was made at a 
unification-related ministers' meeting held early Saturday 
morning chaired by Deputy Premier Yi. 
  "Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who recently visited 
your side, has relayed to us that your top leader proposed 
holding a South-North summit in the near future without any 
conditions," Yi said in his message to Pyongyang. 
  "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to the 
proposal as it is the most ideal event considering the inward 
and outward conditions of our country and the fervent wish of 
our people," he said. 
  The burden on both South and North Koreans has been getting 
heavier over the past half-century because of distrust and 
confrontation, Yi said in the message. 
  "We have been saying that a meeting of the top leaders is 
favorable if it would quickly dissolve the South-North tension 
aroused by the nuclear problem and settle a relationship of 
reconciliation and cooperation by opening the door to peaceful 
reunification of our country," Yi said. 
  Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku, meeting reporters after the 
inter-Korean contact proposal was made, said there is no reason 
to delay the summit because "the sooner, the better." 
  He explained that Seoul made the proposal based on its 
position that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula must be 
realized, peacefully, through negotiation. 
  "It's the government's stance that results should be 
produced 
in the near future so that this preparatory contact would not 
drag on or pose problems in procedure and agenda-setting as in 
past contacts," he said. 
  The proposed meeting on June 28 is not designed to discuss 
exchanging special envoys but to prepare for a summit, the 
unification minister said. "It will be a working-level contact 
to decide on the time and location soon so that the summit can 
take place."

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 19 June 
carry articles and editorials on the proposed summit talks 
between ROK President Kim Yong-sam and DPRK President Kim 
Il-song. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "In Not Even 24 Hours." The editorial starts 
off by expressing hope that "the North Korean nuclear issue can 
be resolved through dialogue and realize the South-North summit 
talks" so that it will be an opportunity to further move toward 
achieving reunification. The editorial criticizes the 
government for hurriedly accepting President Kim Il-song's 
proposal for summit talks saying that it seems that this matter 
was not examined thoroughly. While urging that no decisions be 
made until North Korea shows practical reliability, it says that 
South-North summit talks will be welcomed with "open arms" if 
North Korea truly comes forward to the arena of dialogue to 
guarantee inspections and nuclear transparency. The editorial 
concludes by saying that the ROK must not be "dragged along" by 
North Korea. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "The Truth and Falsehood of the South-North 
Summit Talks." The editorial begins by welcoming the 
possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Then it 
notes that "the government must prudently consider North Korea's 
true intention" on holding the summit talks. The editorial 
continues to point out "Kim Il-song's dualism" noting that this 
proposal may only be a disguised will for peace. Noting that 
originally summit talks are held when about 90 percent of the 
pending issues between the countries concerned are resolved by 
the high-ranking working-level officials, there are 
prerequisites to be solved before holding the summit talks. It 
also notes that without solving the various prerequisites, the 
summit talks will only be for propaganda use and that it may 
only be a "trap," thus giving disappointment to the people. The 
editorial concludes by urging the government to solve 
prerequisites and the United States to delay the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks until complete and thorough nuclear inspections 
are carried out. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "The Anticipated South-North Summit Talks." 
Noting that "a new chapter can be opened in resolving the 
nuclear issue and reconciliation and cooperation between the 
South and North can be achieved" if the South-North summit is 
realized, the editorial elaborates on expectations for holding 
the summit. The editorial notes that it welcomes the summit 
talks but that at the same time it notes that this matter must 
be "observed with prudence." Noting the subtle timing for the 
proposal of the summit talks, the editorial points out that this 
may be a "tactic" for North Korea to escape from its difficult 
situation. The editorial concludes that the ROK must recognize 
the true intention of Kim Il-song's proposal for the summit 
talks and take prudence. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
900-word editorial entitled "Meeting Between the Summits Has a 
Great Significance." The editorial starts off by welcoming the 
possibility of holding the South-North summit talks. Noting 
that a working-level contact will be held soon for the summit 
talks, the editorial expresses the hope that the summit talks 
can be realized soon from "the level of national interest." It 
continues to elaborate on why it is necessary to hold the summit 
talks, emphasizing that "it will play a decisive role in 
creating an atmosphere" to resolve pending issues between the 
South and North. However, the editorial expresses worry over the 
true intention of Kim Il-song in his proposal for the summit 
talks, noting that the ROK must have a thorough understanding of 
his true intention. The editorial concludes by saying that 
since nuclear transparency is the most important pending issue 
in South-North relations, it will be desirable to guarantee 
nuclear transparency and then hold the summit talks. 
  SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by 
reporter Yang Sung-hyon on the ROK Government's position 
regarding the possibility of holding the South-North summit 
talks. The article says that if the South-North summit is 
realized, it will be a decisive motive in resolving the nuclear 
issue. While noting that the exchange of special envoys of the 
South and North must be realized to discuss the holding of the 
summit talks, officials view that if such dialogue is resumed, 
it will be carried out actively to realize the summit talks. 
Noting Kim Il-song's message to hold summit talks, which was 
conveyed to the ROK by Former U.S. President Carter, the paper 
says officials view that there is a 50-50 chance that Kim 
Il-song is sincere. 
  The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN publishes on 
page 2 a 1,000-word article by reporters Kim Se-song and Yi 
Tong-chu on the significance and prospects for holding the 
South-North summit talks. The article begins by saying a new 
phase has opened in South-North relations due to the possibility 
of holding the South-North summit talks. Noting that 
Chongwadae, the presidential office, conveyed to Mr. Carter its 
acceptance of the summit talks, it seems that the "Carter 
channel" will be used for the time being. The article notes 
that if Kim Il-song has the will to hold the summit talks, it 
first means that he will face all South-North issues including 
the nuclear issue "head on," and second, it may only be a 
"gesture to temporarily escape the nuclear crisis." The article 
notes that what cannot be overlooked is the fact that the 
proposal for holding the summit talks may be an "appeasement 
strategy" to "resume dialogue with the United States." The 
article concludes by urging the government to examine this 
matter with prudence. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial on the North-South summit talks. The 
editorial appraises that the proposal evokes much expectation 
particularly because the two presidents agreed to hold the talks 
"anytime, anywhere, and without any conditions." The editorial 
also expressed suspicion because of North Korea's past record of 
breaking various promises and agreements. The editorial notes 
that whether or not Kim Il-song's proposal is a strategy to 
escape from the current situation should be determined by how 
faithful the North Korean attitude is in the forthcoming 
working-level contacts to prepare for the summit talks. The 
editorial reaffirms that "the working-level contacts should not 
be used to delay sanctions." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN also publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word 
article by reporter Kim Chung-il on the background and prospects 
of the North-South summit talks. The article analyzes that if 
Kim Il-song made the proposal as an extension of his remarks 
regretting the rupture of past summit talks proposals, it will 
be a mere appeasement gesture. However, if Kim Il-song is 
determined to hold the talks, the article analyzes that the 
proposal will be based on North Korea's "political and economic 
interests" because "North Korea needs South Korea's economic aid 
to restructure its economy which is essential to maintaining 
political stability." 
  Turning to the agenda of the summit talks, the article 
believes the nuclear issue cannot be resolved in a single round 
of talks because the North will not give up the nuclear 
development at once while the South wants complete transparency 
through more inspections, even though the United States might be 
satisfied with North Korea's merely remaining in the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. The article further warns that the ROK 
Government should be prepared to make a decision when North 
Korea requests the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea 
during its negotiations with the United States. 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 1,000-word article 
by 
reporter Yi Sung-chol on the significance of Kim Il-song's 
proposal for talks. The article finds it significant that 
"North Korea recognized the ROK as a dialogue partner" making a 
concession from its previous stance that the nuclear issue can 
only be resolved between the North and the United States. The 
article hopes that the dual communications channel will give new 
possibilities of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue 
because it will be easier for the United States to accept the 
package deal proposed by the North if the North-South summit 
talks are realized. The article anticipates that "the North 
Korea-U.S. talks will still be the core channel for the nuclear 
issue while the North-South summit talks could discuss mutual 
inspections [sangho sachal] and the compliance of the joint 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." 
  The article points out that a key matter is the verification 
of North Korea's past nuclear activities. The article is 
concerned that the nuclear issue will again face a crisis if 
North Korea refuses to discuss the assurance of transparency 
during negotiations with the United States. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
900-word editorial entitled "Expecting an Honest Meeting for the 
Nation." The editorial appraises the proposal as "the most 
tangible possibility" different from previous official and 
nonofficial North-South contacts. The editorial says that 
previous dialogue proposals by both North and South Korea, 
including those by President Kim Yong-sam, were political 
strategies to solidify domestic positions, and hopes that "this 
time, the summit talks will not be ruptured by collateral 
conditions irrelevant to the essence of the talks." 
  HANGYORE SINMUN also publishes on page 3 a 1,100-word 
article 
by reporter Chang Chong-su on the background and prospects of 
the summit proposal. The editorial analyzes that Kim Il-song is 
truly pursuing improved North-South relations because he 
proposed the summit talks "when the communications channel with 
the United States was not closed but opened by Former U.S. 
President Carter's visit." 
  The article also analyzes that the United States pressured 
both North and South Korea behind-the-scenes to improve 
relations and that the North proposed the summit talks to prove 
their will to ease tensions. 
  The article expects many obstacles on the way to realizing 
the summit talks because the ROK Government has not given up on 
UN sanctions and would not ignore North Korea's possession of 
nuclear weapons for the sake of improved relations. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Prerequisites of North-South Summit Talks." 
The editorial notes that the proposal could be a positive one 
if there are no political calculations which have always been 
the obstacle of North-South dialogue. The editorial also 
welcomes the proposal as an opportunity for the ROK to take the 
initiative in resolving the nuclear issue. 
  Recalling how "inefficient" previous working-level contacts 
for the exchange of special envoys were, the editorial urges the 
government to be fully prepared to carry out working-level 
contacts for the summit talks. The editorial also warns the 
government of the "strategic aspect" of the proposal. Noting 
that North Korea made the proposal through a third party, 
Carter, the editorial analyzes that North Korea may have made 
the gesture of summit talks to expedite DPRK-U.S. contacts. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO also publishes on page 3 a 1,000-world article 
by reporter Kim Hyon-ik on the prospects of the summit talks. 
Admitting that Kim Il-song's proposal has blurred the focus of 
the nuclear issue and that everything is going as Kim Il-song 
intended, the article expects that tension on the Korean 
peninsula will be alleviated for the time being. The article 
states that if North Korea tries to make little progress during 
the working-level contacts, that will prove that the proposal 
was a strategy to avoid sanctions. The article reports that 
"ROK specialists on North Korean affairs are expressing concerns 
that the sudden variable of Carter's visit might have wasted all 
the efforts to adopt UN Security Council sanctions against North 
Korea."

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
ordered thorough preparations for a possible inter-Korean summit 
Monday, calling it an event "that may change our post-liberation 
history." 
  Kim made the instructions after a unification-related 
ministerial meeting was held earlier in the day chaired by 
Deputy Premier Yi Yong-tok. 
  The chances of an inter-Korean summit -- the first ever -- 
are at an all-time high with the top leaders of both South and 
North Korea agreeing in principle to the meeting. 
  Deputy Premier Yi pointed out that the government held a 
series of meetings over the weekend to lay out specifics for the 
South-North summit. 
  "The meeting participants are very much in tune with each 
other, allowing for rapid progress," said Yi.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea notified its 
allies and members of the U.N. Security Council Monday of its 
decision to propose a contact with North Korea for an 
inter-Korean summit. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said the notices were 
sent to Japan, the United States, the permanent members of the 
Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) right after the morning's unification-related ministers' 
meeting decided in favor of the proposal. 
  Chang again welcomed the agreement on a South-North summit, 
saying that it moves forward inter-Korean relations in dealing 
with the nuclear problem. 
  "The significance lies in the fact that the South Korean 
Government will secure a role," said the spokesman. 
  He predicted that the talks leading up to the inter-Korean 
summit will progress in pace with the third round of high-level 
dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington, adding that North 
Korea's intentions must still be confirmed beforehand. 
  If it comes off, the summit will serve to revive the 
activities of various inter-Korean committees, including the 
joint Nuclear Control Commission to implement simultaneous 
nuclear inspections between the two sides. 
  "Inter-Korean dialogue will progress in a mutually 
complementary fashion with North Korea-U.S., North Korea-IAEA 
dialogue," Chang said. "South Korea and the United States will 
keep in close consultation."

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The government will hold 
ministerial meetings to take prompt and appropriate steps toward 
South-North economic cooperation, which is expected to expand 
rapidly with the prospective summit between the two Koreas' 
presidents. 
  Relevant authorities said Monday the government would 
probably start consultations among related ministries this week 
to accelerate internal economic exchanges that have ground to a 
standstill because of the row over North Korea's nuclear program. 
  A government official said the first stage of meetings would 
involve the National Unification Board (NUB), the Economic 
Planning Board (EPB) and the Trade, Industry and Energy 
Ministry, but more detailed consultations would come after the 
summit and an ensuing premier-level meeting. 
  "After the summit and premiers' meeting," he said, "the NUB 
will map out the overall framework for the political, social, 
economic and cultural fields and then the issue of internal 
economic cooperation will be discussed intensively." 
  Southern business circles, which have been skeptical about 
internal cooperation because of the nuclear wrangling, will soon 
resume their investment programs for North Korea as well as 
indirect and processing-on-commission trade. 
  If the presidential summit is realized and obstacles to 
South-North economic cooperation are removed, the private sector 
in particular is expected to accelerate direct internal trade, 
joint investment and visits to North Korea by businessmen and 
technicians. 
  Detailed projects in North Korea that have been planned by 
South Korean business circles include an advance into the 
industrial zones of Rajin and Sonbong, construction of the Nampo 
industrial complex, and investment in the Kimchaek iron and 
steel factory. 
  Earlier the government disclosed a three-stage economic 
cooperation program, with the first phase pushing such 
demonstrative projects as construction of the Nampo industrial 
complex. The second stage was designed to activate exchanges in 
the mineral, agricultural, fisheries and communications sectors. 
The third stage was intended to organize a South-North Korean 
economic community on the basis of the previous stages. 
  If the South-North meetings can agree on mutual opening of 
economic offices, the government is expected to expedite 
institutional means of expanding internal economic cooperation 
such as protection of industrial property rights, an investment 
guarantee accord, a dual-taxation prevention agreement and 
establishment of open accounts to settle trade balances. 
  In addition, talks on opening more direct sea routes are 
likely to support such economic cooperation. Last April, a 
direct sea route linking Pusan and Chongjin was formally opened 
and Inchon and Nampo ports were utilized as a virtually direct 
sea route between the two Koreas. At the same time, other 
direct routes linking Sokcho and Chongjin, and Pusan and Rajin 
are likely to be opened formally. 
  In the meantime, the government is expected to resume 
preparations for restoring rail lines that have been cut off 
since the 1950-53 Korean war. The railways under study include 
lines linking Seoul-Uiju and Seoul-Wonju. 
  With the expansion of mutual exchanges, opening of air 
routes 
between Kimpo and Sunan will become a vital project.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Monday his government has in fact prepared for a 
South-North summit since long ago in expectation of a North 
Korean proposal for summit talks. 
  "This is why I readily accepted Kim Il-song's offer for a 
summit as conveyed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter over 
the weekend," the president said. 
  President Kim made the remarks over a luncheon he hosted at 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] for a group of 97 bureau 
directors of non-economic government offices. 
  He said the South proposed to have a working-level meeting 
on 
Tuesday next week after the issue was meticulously reviewed over 
the weekend and Sunday morning. 
  "We offered to them to have a working-level meeting on June 
28 since we don't need to have complex talks and all we have to 
agree to is the place and time (of a summit)," Kim said. 
  He was quick to add, however, that the South cannot tolerate 
North Korea going nuclear. "There should be no nuclear arms on 
the Korean peninsula under any circumstances," the president 
stressed.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku said on Monday his government intends to materialize the 
proposed South-North summit meeting at an early date through 
speedy preliminary talks. "We will try to have working-level 
preparatory talks in a way that won't be bound by agenda 
topics," Yi said. 
  Testifying before the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and 
Unification Committee, Yi said that in the past, many proposed 
high-level inter-Korean talks failed to take place due to 
haggling over agenda topics. He said the South cannot disregard 
the North's nuclear past, adding, "This stand of ours was 
explained to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and our 
understanding is that Mr. Carter duly conveyed it to the North 
Koreans during his recent visit to Pyongyang." 
  Yi who is also National Unification minister observed that a 
third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level meeting could take place 
earlier than expected if the Carter-Kim Il-song agreement could 
be made a governmental agreement between the two countries. 
  On the issue of supporting the North's construction of 
light-water reactors, Yi said the South can agree to such 
support only after North Korea made clear a plan to give up 
their nuclear development. The construction of two 
900,000kw-class light-water reactors North Korea wishes to have 
would cost about 3.6 to 4 billion dollars, Yi said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yi Hong-ku, South Korean deputy prime </F>
minister and minister of unification appearing in split screen 
from unspecified place, by KBS anchorman Yi Yun-song, in studio 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Anchorman Yi Yun-song] How are you, Minister Yi? 
President Kim Il-song's recent proposal for a summit was made 
through a third person, namely former U.S. President Carter, not 
through official channels. What is behind the government's 
assessment that official verification of the North's intention 
is not necessary? 
  [Minister Yi Hong-ku] If a proposal is related to internal 
relations or is put forward between two different countries, it 
should be made through diplomatic channels and be examined 
through official means. However, as you know, this is related to 
an international issue of the nation, and there is no fixed 
procedure for this kind of event. 
  We assessed that the North's intention conveyed by former 
U.S. President Carter is relatively precise. Therefore, we 
decided to push ahead for the talks. 
  [Anchorman Yi] As you, Mr. Minister, pointed out earlier, 
acceptance of the proposal for a summit and our proposal for 
holding a working-level contact for the summit have taken place 
simultaneously. Is there any special reason for us to propose 
first a working-level contact? 
  [Minister Yi] As all of our people may agree, the situation 
on and around the Korean peninsula is very strained. This being 
the case, we think that if one decides to resolve all problems, 
including the strained situation, through summit talks, we 
should push ahead with such talks as soon as possible. This is 
precisely the reason we put forward the proposal first. 
  Besides, we maintained the position that all problems can be 
sufficiently discussed between the top leaders of both sides. 
Therefore, there would be no serious obstacles in preparing the 
summit. 
  [Anchorman Yi] How does the government grasp the true 
intention of the North side in proposing a North-South summit at 
this point? 
  [Minister Yi] As we know, former U.S. President Carter 
recently visited North Korea. However, in view of the 
international atmosphere and of the atmosphere on the Korean 
peninsula, it is highly likely that the North Korean side drew a 
conclusion that a resolution of all problems would be difficult 
without direct dialogue between the North and South, which are 
the very relevant parties. 
  [Anchorman Yi] How will you deal with the issue of nuclear 
transparency in the future? 
  [Minister Yi] The issue of nuclear transparency is an 
important, inevitable issue for a solution to the nuclear 
problem. Therefore, this issue will always remain as an 
important one in the future as well. However, we do not intend 
to raise this issue during the forthcoming preliminary contact 
because we want to advance the contact to a summit without 
wrangling with each other over agenda items, just as in the 
past. This is why we do not directly mention the issue. 
  [Anchorman Yi] People think that a summit without any 
substantive result and a summit merely for the sake of a summit 
is not desirable. What we are most worried about is that the 
summit may result only in giving time to North Korea for its 
suspected nuclear development. How do you view this? 
  [Minister Yi] Such worries are quite natural. However, as 
our president has mentioned many times, our position is not to 
hold talks merely for the sake of talks. The very situation we 
are facing today necessitates talks between the North and the 
South. This is why we are pushing ahead with the talks. 
  Who would benefit from these talks is an issue that we 
should 
cautiously examine. However, we believe that holding talks would 
be beneficial to both sides and to our nation. 
  [Anchorman Yi] The world, although welcoming it, is 
generally 
showing a cautious reaction to the North-South summit proposal. 
How is the government analyzing external conditions for a summit? 
  [Minister Yi] History shows that summits were not successful 
on the Korean peninsula despite brisk discussions for their 
realization. This being the case, no one can be sure about the 
success in talks. This is why some people have expectations and 
hope for the talks while the others are worried about them. 
  Nevertheless, we believe it is right that at a time when the 
Cold War has ended, both, the North and South should directly 
seek means for the resolution of problems based on the principle 
for solving problems by those who are directly concerned. This 
is the position of our side in pushing for the talks. 
  [Anchorman Yi] Thank you for your interview today.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
stressed Monday that a summit between South and North Korea must 
be held to resolve the two sides' problems, presidential 
spokesman Chu Ton-sik quoted the president as saying. 
  While meeting U.S. Senators John McCain (R.-Ariz.) and Phil 
Gramm (R.-Tex.) to discuss the political situation on the Korean 
peninsula, including the nuclear dispute and military 
cooperation between South Korea and the United States, Kim said: 
"It is very important for the South and North to make mutual 
inspections (of each other's nuclear facilities) in the end, 
although discussions are under way on the nuclear issue between 
the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA)," according to Chu. 
  President Kim was also quoted as saying that his government 
has been preparing for the South-North summit meeting. "We sent 
a telephone message (to the North) this morning, to the effect 
that the two sides should discuss the time and place on the 
grand principle of holding a South-North summit meeting, because 
we think there's no need to delay a summit." 
  Senator McCain, meanwhile, said he was convinced of the 
importance of maintaining close military cooperation between 
Seoul and Washington after touring the Korea-U.S. Combined 
Forces Command, according to Chu. 
  McCain reportedly said the American forces have a heightened 
awareness of security, which had seemingly weakened since the 
end of the Cold War, adding he felt that the U.S. Second 
Infantry Division was the strongest in the world. 
  Congratulating Kim for carrying out vigorous reform, McCain 
voiced admiration for the president's popularity. The senator 
praised Kim's motto of "clean government, strong economy" and 
promised to reflect the motto in the Republican Party platform 
in 1996, according to Chu.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- Share prices jumped 
sharply at the Korean Stock Exchange on Monday at the report of 
a possible South-North summit meeting. 
  The leading composite stock price index was up 16.31 points, 
or 1.76 percent, over the weekend to finish at 942.50. 
  Besides the summit issue, the stock authorities' decision to 
allow three Hyundai firms' issues to be transacted off-board 
contributed to the overall surge. 
  Volume was large with 49 million shares changing hands at 
900 
billion won (1,116.62 million U.S. dollars). 
  Advancing issues overwhelmed decliners 632 to 181 with 76 
others remaining unchanged. Mining and insurance were only 
major issues that slid. The rise of construction, trade and 
banking issues was especially sharp.

<F P=106> [First of a two-part feature article by correspondent Yi </F>
Sang-sok from Washington: "Simulated Scenario: Dialogue or War?"] 
  [Excerpts] A ghost of rumors about a crisis on the Korean 
peninsula has been dancing in the United States. It seems that 
the ghost has issued "a general mobilization order" to the 
people's Cold-War thoughts that had faded since the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. 
  The U.S. high-altitude reconnaissance plane Blackbird 
(SR-71) 
that disappeared in 1990 is getting ready to be put into 
commission again. The voice demanding the cancellation of the 
order to withdraw tactical nuclear weapons issued by former U.S. 
President George Bush while he was in the office is resounding 
fiercely. In addition, some people even insist on a limited 
attack on North Korean nuclear facilities, and it seems that the 
attack would not be a limited one. 
  As described above, the heat of the speculation on a crisis 
on the Korean peninsula that has spread in the United States is 
increasing in proportion to the cooling speed of the fuel rods 
taken out by North Korea from its five-megawatt reactor in 
Yongbyong. This is a so-called "bandwagon phenomenon". 
  The U.S. doves, who originally supported a solution to the 
North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, are one by one 
leaving their nest for that of the hawks. They have decided to 
no longer put up with North Korea's attitude after watching a 
series of measures it took. The actual development of the 
situation has made U.S. controversialists, who were denouncing 
the insistence on attacking North Korean nuclear facilities and 
on the inevitability of a second Korean war as a great mistake, 
change their position. [passage omitted] 
  It is interesting that leading U.S. public opinion circles 
on 
the North Korean nuclear issue make it impossible for people to 
categorize their view as conservative or progressive. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is clear, however, that every inch of the arguments by 
Americans on the North Korean nuclear issue are based on their 
own country's interests. Without mentioning some people's 
viewpoint that a scheme is being plotted, it can be said there 
is a common view that the United States will not hesitate in 
bringing about a war [chonjaengul pulsahal kosiranun ke sangsik] 
if it believes that raising the North Korean nuclear issue as an 
international crisis is advantageous to itself [segyejok wigiro 
pugak sikinun kosi yuikhadago pandandoemyon]. The Clinton 
administration, however, does not seem to have decided to fight 
with North Korea to the end. 
  At present, the hard-liners are leading the main current of 
the U.S. policy toward North Korea. Accordingly, I think it is 
a reasonable view that a stick rather than a carrot is envisaged 
in the current U.S. scenario for resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue. Although the stick policy might have been 
brought about by North Korea itself, it will certainly worsen 
the crisis on the Korean peninsula for the time being. No one 
can predict whether the crisis will rapidly increase or decrease 
at any point, or will go in a direction that all of us are 
concerned about. The North Korean nuclear issue, that has been 
dragged out for more than three years, is now on the edge of a 
precipice.

<F P=106> [Second of a two-part feature article by Chong Pyong-chin: </F>
"Simulated Scenario: Dialogue or War?"] 
  [Excerpts] Rapid progress is being made in resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue. The North Korean nuclear issue has 
entered a totally new phase as North Korea and the United States 
are moving toward an agreement on dialogue with "special envoy 
Jimmy Carter" as a mediator. [passage omitted] 
  The United States expressed its willingness to suspend 
efforts for UN sanctions on North Korea and to hold the third 
round of talks if North Korea returns to its previous status; if 
it returns to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and 
does not withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
Therefore, it seems that if North Korea accepts the U.S. 
proposal, the North Korean nuclear issue will "run the course of 
dialogue" as opposed to the "accelerating sanctions" situation 
that prevailed two days ago. [passage omitted] 
  Accordingly, how North Korea will prove its nuclear 
transparency and to what extent the United States will improve 
its relations with North Korea are expected to be focused in the 
discussions at the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, if 
they are held. 
  With regard to the verification of North Korea's nuclear 
transparency, the United States will demand special inspections 
[tukpyol sachal kkaji] by the IAEA, and North Korea will insist 
that the nuclear development will naturally be frozen as a 
result of the abolition of its existing nuclear facilities and 
by the U.S. assistance in the light-water reactor system. This 
difference in opinion between North Korea and the United States 
will probably cause another tug-of-war. It is expected, 
however, that a clue to solving the problem will be found in the 
agreement between Jimmy Carter and President Kim Il-song on 
"building mutual trust". 
  The extent to which the United States will proceed with 
discussions on improving its relations with North Korea will 
totally depend on North Korea's attitude. The United States has 
said that it will improve relations with North Korea to a 
considerable extent if North Korea proves its "100 percent 
innocence" in regard to the development and possession of 
nuclear weapons. The United States and our government have 
completed coordination on this position. [passage omitted] 
  The ROK and the United States have agreed that "when the 
third round of North Korea-U.S. talks is held, South-North 
dialogue for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula should be held, 
and this means South-North bilateral inspections." This 
reflects our position that North Korea's nuclear transparency 
must be verified, not only by the IAEA, but also by our 
government. It is the line drawn by the policy of our 
government, which is one of the parties most directly concerned 
with the North Korean nuclear issue, but has kept away from 
negotiations on the issue, and it is its due demand. [passage 
omitted] 
  We should also pay attention to the possibility that, as the 
supply of light-water reactors require a long time, several 
years, and a budget of several trillion won, North Korea will 
demand the fourth and fifth rounds of North Korea-U.S. talks 
while insisting on "freezing its nuclear development after the 
supply of light-water reactors." In preparation for this 
possible situation, the ROK and the United States are likely to 
put on hold [yuye] the draft resolution on UN sanctions on North 
Korea, rather than abolish it. The policy of "dialogue for 
sanctions and sanctions for dialogue" will inevitably be the 
basic principle that the ROK and the United States should adhere 
to until the North Korean nuclear issue is completely resolved.

  [Text] As North Korea's nuclear issue has abruptly entered 
a dialogue phase with the talks between North Korean President 
Kim Il-song and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as momentum, 
the government is outwardly showing a very prudent attitude, 
although it has become very embarrassed. 
  At the Unification Security Coordination Council meeting 
held 
on 17 June, the government showed a different reaction to the 
results of the Kim-Carter talks from that of the United States. 
The government stated: "We will fine-tune our position after 
studying former President Carter's talks with Kim." This 
reflects the complicated stance of the government. 
  The government is showing such a reserved attitude because 
the government feels as if it had been hit on the back of the 
head-- because the United States, which has so far led the moves 
for the imposition of sanctions, has abruptly changed its 
attitude--while attempting to keep pace with the U.S. policy. 
  Since North Korea unilaterally replaced fuel rods at the 
five-megawatt reactor, the United States has virtually attached 
preconditions to the realization of the third round of 
North-U.S. talks by stressing that "there should be an advance 
in the negotiations between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]" before the third round of talks are 
held. 
  As soon as the substance of the talks between former 
President Carter and Kim Il-song was made public, U.S. President 
Clinton and Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci have made the 
holding of North-U.S. talks a fait accompli, while responding 
affirmatively to North Korea's proposal. In this connection, 
some officials are even speculating if there have been secret 
contacts between the United States and North Korea. 
  One government official in authority stated: "North Korea's 
proposal is a new one in terms of its intention to allow IAEA 
inspectors to remain in North Korea and to guarantee the 
operations of monitoring devices. A top priority for us is to 
certify what else is included in the proposal." 
  The government is still unclear about the following 
regarding 
North Korea's proposal: the substitution of a light-water 
reactor; the return to safeguards regulations of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and the IAEA, including special 
inspections [tukbyol sachal]; and a freeze on nuclear 
development. 
  The government feels if North Korea's promise turns out to 
be 
true, it has no choice but to agree to the holding of the third 
round of high-level North-U.S. talks. 
  Under the circumstances in which the United States has 
virtually made the holding of North-U.S. talks a fait accompli, 
the government seems to have taken such a position on the basis 
of its own judgment that, although it is somewhat unbecoming, 
the government will have to follow the United States if the 
proposal includes "special inspections," in which North Korea's 
past nuclear development will be uncovered; and "a freeze on 
nuclear development," in which the future and the present are 
guaranteed. 
  As a result of the abrupt turnaround of the United States, 
the government has been mired in a dilemma. Some officials 
believe the government should distance itself from the United 
States when dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue in the 
future. Therefore, it is expected that the turnaround of the 
United States this time will serve as a factor for conflict 
between the ROK and the United States during the UN Security 
Council debate on sanctions in the future. 
  One official concerned stated: "This dialogue phase will 
serve as a turning point to help escape from another crisis, 
rather than as a decisive opportunity for the settlement of the 
situation. We should reexamine the ROK-U.S. cooperative system 
this time, to avoid North Korea's nuclear development from 
becoming a long-term issue."

  [Text] Signs of disagreement are emerging between the ROK 
and the United States in fine-tuning their policies to solve 
North Korea's nuclear issue. 
  It is obvious that the United States has begun mapping out a 
policy of "offensive negotiations" on the basis of the result of 
"the Carter-Kim Il-song talks." In contrast, our government is 
taking pains to downgrade the significance of the result of 
Carter's visit to the North, merely repeating its previous 
attitude of pushing for both "dialogue and sanctions." 
  When U.S. President Clinton's "willingness to hold 
high-level 
North-U.S. talks" was made public on 17 June, the officials who 
are deeply involved in the government's policy-making process 
did not hide their displeasure. They said: "We do not know why 
the United States has made public its `willingness to have 
talks' so early without officially confirming President Kim 
Il-song's remarks." The officials expressed their concern by 
stating: "The United States seems to be attempting to seek a 
turnaround in its domestic political situation by heightening 
the dramatic effects of its efforts to solve North Korea's 
nuclear issue. The United States needs, first, to closely 
examine if North Korea is possibly using tactics to gain time." 
  Our government continues to be agonizing over that it is 
neither easy nor reasonable to refute U.S. logic for "resuming 
talks." 
  It seems that our government's passive attitude originates 
from President Kim Yong-sam's "remarks consistently calling for 
sanctions against the North" and "his cynical attitude to 
Carter's visit to the North." Recently, President Kim 
determinedly stated: "There is no way to solve North Korea's 
nuclear issue other than sanctions." He has expressed his strong 
displeasure several times by stating: "The Kim Il-song regime 
will likely make bad use of Carter's visit to the North." As 
the strongly worded remarks by the head of state are still 
vividly remembered, it is not easy to highly appraise Carter's 
"go-between efforts" or to apply logic to a change to a dialogue 
phase. 
  At first, our government had asked that Carter's visit to 
the 
North be held in abeyance. Rejecting this, the United States 
notified our government that "he is visiting the North in a 
private capacity and is not carrying any official message from 
the U.S. Government." 
  This notwithstanding, as soon as the result of the 
Carter-Kim 
Il-song talks were made public on 16 June, U.S. President 
Clinton convened an emergency meeting and even issued "a special 
statement." Of course, before issuing the statement, the U.S. 
Government tried to save the ROK Government's face by going 
through the formality of making prior consultations via 
telephone talks between Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the early morning of 17 
June [Korean time]. 
  It is highly likely that the U.S. Government has also 
conveyed its position to North Korea through former President 
Carter that UN Security Council debate on sanctions against the 
North will be discontinued in case talks between North Korea and 
the United States resume. It would not be realistic to continue 
both dialogue and UN Security Council debate on sanctions at the 
same time. Of course, the U.S. Government immediately denied 
the news reports that former President Carter said that UN 
Security Council debate on sanctions will be discontinued if 
conditions are met. The prevailing opinion, however, is that 
this was aimed at relieving the ROK Government's embarrassment. 
  It has now been learned that the United States is studying 
in 
an affirmative manner the question of upgrading the high-level 
talks as requested by President Kim Il-song through Carter. 
Therefore, it seems that the dialogue between the North and the 
United States will proceed at a high pace. If the ROK 
Government continues to fuss about its delayed involvement in 
dealing with this issue, it will further be left out in the cold 
in North-U.S. negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon: "Government's View on </F>
the Carter-Kim Talks"] 
  [Text] The talks between Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
and North Korean President Kim Il-song seem to have frozen the 
developments concerning the North Korean nuclear issue. Whether 
a "green light" will be on is not clear yet. Still, signs are 
strong that a new situation is about to develop. 
  The ROK Government thinks the talks between Carter and Kim 
Il-song will pave the way for resuming dialogue between the 
United States and North Korea. Everyone seems to agree on this. 
This is because the government has left open its door to 
dialogue with North Korea even though it has tried to have the 
UN Security Council pass a resolution on sanctions. An official 
concerned said: "We have no reason to say no to the efforts to 
resolve the issue through the third round of U.S.-North Korea 
talks." 
  Still, the government is quite negative. An official 
concerned said: "We know North Korea better than the United 
States does. We must watch North Korea because it may change 
its attitude anytime." In this way, he did not slacken his 
wariness of North Korea. 
  The government convened a Unification and Security Policy 
Coordination Council meeting, during which no decision was made. 
This means the government decided to wait; it will make a 
decision upon hearing explanations from Carter, who will return 
to Seoul on the morning of 18 June. 
  The government assumes such an attitude because of its 
displeasure with the United States. It seems displeased, first 
of all, with the United States' attitude toward special 
inspections. The government worries that the United States may 
unilaterally seek to back away from the ROK-U.S. agreement to 
penetrate "North Korea's nuclear past." 
  The results of the talks show that holding the third round 
of 
U.S.-North Korea talks is conditioned on "North Korea's freezing 
its nuclear activities at their present level." If North Korea 
expresses its position on this issue through diplomatic 
channels, the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks will take 
place naturally. 
  ROK Government officials have refrained from commenting on 
the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song. This appears to be 
intended to express their displeasure. If a policy concerning a 
draft UN Security Council resolution on sanctions, which was 
released on 16 June, without a justifiable explanation, is 
changed, the trustworthiness of such policy will be questioned. 
Our government seems displeased because Carter was playing the 
role of more than President Clinton's special envoy, even though 
the U.S. Government repeatedly insisted he was visiting North 
Korea as a private citizen and even though our government 
expressed its worry that North Korea might make ill use of him. 
  The attempt by the United States to change its policy by 
taking advantage of Carter's visit to North Korea makes the 
ROK-U.S. cooperation system unstable. Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher had three 
telephone conversations on the morning of 17 June and discussed 
the details of the talks between Carter and Kim Il-song. This 
was a deliberate attempt for the United States to win an 
understanding from our government and dispel our government's 
worry on the cooperation system. 
  Anyway, our government's efforts to push for the sanctions 
will likely go nowhere with making any gain. However, the 
possibility is high that North Korea, as it has done so far, 
will start mapping out and implement another strategy.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Sung-pok] </F>
  [Text] As former U.S. president Jimmy Carter was in 
Pyongyang to defuse tensions sparked by the suspected North 
Korean nuclear weapons program yesterday, a crack appeared in 
the South Korea-U.S. tuning of nuclear strategy against the 
North. 
  An unusually heavy mood was felt at Chongwadae [presidential 
offices]. Even there were signs of embarrassment as Carter's 
first round of talks with North Korean leader Kim Il-song and 
subsequent press conference received a quick response from 
Washington indicating the resumption of dialogue. 
  Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide handling the North 
Korean nuclear issue, avoided reporters. He meets the press 
daily to give them background briefings at his office, a daily 
practice since tension over the nuclear standoff increased. 
  Instead, he huddled with his aides in charge of national 
security affairs, defense and diplomacy. 
  He had an unscheduled meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Korea 
James Laney. Chong was to receive a visit from Russian 
Ambassador to Korea Georgiy Kunadze who observers said was to 
explain to him his government's position on the U.S.-led draft 
sanctions resolution to be put to the United Nations Security 
Council. But he canceled the meeting with Kunadze to meet Laney. 
  Chongwadae appeared embarrassed to find out that Carter's 
visit to Pyongyang, which was billed as private and 
self-initiated, can in no way be viewed in that context. 
  In his June 10 telephone conversation with President Kim 
Yong-sam who was leery of possible adverse affects of Carter's 
planned visit to the North, Clinton assured him that the trip to 
Pyongyang was self-initiated and had nothing to do with his 
administration. 
  Clinton also assured President Kim that he will not change 
his mind in pursuing sanctions against the renegade communist 
country whatever conciliatory message Carter may bring from 
Pyongyang. 
  President Kim has stressed from time to time that no 
dialogue 
will be sought with the North until the first-phase of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions are imposed. He has also added that 
this position was agreed to by the United States. 
  Since Pyongyang's unilateral refueling of the 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor without monitoring by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), President Kim has held the belief that a 
lack of tough measures by Seoul and the international community 
has allowed the North to take the initiatives at every turn of 
developments. Now it is necessary to turn the tables around, 
stressing the need to impose sanctions. 
  However, yesterday's dispatches from Pyongyang quoting 
Carter 
and the quick response from the White House have Seoul and 
Washington turning toward dialogue rather than determined action 
by the international community. 
  During his two and a half hour dinner meeting with Carter on 
the eve of his departure for Pyongyang, President Kim reportedly 
said he did not want to add to the "burden" on Carter's 
shoulder, a position indicating that he did not ask Carter to 
convey any important message of his own to Kim Il-song. 
  He was said to have only explained in detail his 
government's 
position against the North's nuclear ambitions. 
  Apart from the discrepancies between Seoul and Washington, 
there are some mistakes in judgment on the part of Chongwadae 
staffers and officials of the National Unification Board. 
  They failed to give due weight to Carter's visit. 
  It was too late when a Chongwadae staffer learned that 
Carter 
would be greeted by Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong of North 
Korea at the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  Pointing out the fact, the official stressed the need to pay 
attention to Pyongyang's intention which he said is to regard 
Carter as a "political negotiator" not just a visitor on a 
private mission. 
  But this was not taken seriously by senior officials, it was 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by reporters Kim Chang-ki and Pak Tu-sik: "ROK </F>
Government's Reaction to Carter's Remarks--Government Relies on 
Fragmentary Foreign News Reports and Keenly Feels a Lack of 
Information"] 
  [Excerpts] On 17 June, ROK Government officials concerned 
who had followed Former U.S. President Carter's visit to North 
Korea paid close attention to foreign news reports on details of 
his second-day talks in North Korea and the U.S. Government's 
reaction to them. Particularly, when at around 1800 that day 
they heard the news that the "sanctions process had stopped," a 
statement Carter reportedly made, they looked perplexed and were 
busy trying to confirm whether the report was true. 
  At 2000 that day the ROK Foreign Ministry released a 
commentary that casts doubt on the remarks. Immediately after 
that, the U.S. White House released a statement that says that 
"what Carter said was not true." The Foreign Ministry, then, 
said it had thought so in the first place. Chongwadae 
[presidential offices] looked relieved later that night when the 
White House notified it that the report was not true. The 
government officials concerned complained about, among other 
things, a lack of information throughout that day. It was 
difficult for them to know, from foreign news reports, what 
Carter told [DPRK] President Kim, what Kim told Carter, and what 
Carter and Clinton discussed over the telephone. They looked 
helpless. [passage omitted] 
  Some officials concerned said: "Our objective in pushing for 
sanctions is to hasten the resolution of the nuclear issue 
through dialogue. Therefore, resuming North Korea-U.S. dialogue 
is nothing strange." They also pointed out: "Nevertheless, 
North Korea's `true intention' must be verified." Foreign 
Ministry officials concerned looked embarrassed all day long. 
They said: "The West may not be being fooled by a few words of 
Kim Il-song, which are nothing new." They also said: "We have 
no choice but to see how the United States will change until 
North Korea's intention is revealed at upcoming U.S.-North Korea 
talks." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Carter-Kim Chong-il (replacement)" -- YONHAP headline] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korean leader Kim 
Il-song stressed the importance of high-level dialogue between 
Pyongyang and Washington, saying that is where the two sides 
could discuss ways to make North Korean nuclear program 
transparent, Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter told South 
Korean officials Saturday. 
  He delivered Kim's remarks in his talks with Foreign 
Minister 
Han Sung-chu after his arrival from Pyongyang, ministry 
spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. 
  Han was quoted as telling him that the North Korea-U.S. 
talks 
should be consulted between Seoul and Washington after the two 
countries confirm North Korea's true intentions. 
  Carter explained that reports about him telling Kim Il-song 
that the United States stopped discussing sanctions against 
North Korea was a result of misinterpretation, saying he meant 
the sanctions will be temporarily suspended on condition that 
the nuclear suspicion is resolved. 
  The ex-president and his wife returned to Seoul after a 
four-day visit to North Korea where he met twice with the senior 
Kim for extensive talks on the nuclear problem. 
  He came back with a message that Kim wants to directly meet 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam "without any delay." 
  Meanwhile, Carter said he tried to meet also with Kim 
Il-song's heir-apparent son Kim Chong-il during his trip but was 
denied. 
  A South Korean official said Carter asked several times that 
he be able to meet junior Kim through North Korean officials but 
was refused, being told that Kim Chong-il did not have time.

<F P=106> [YONHAP report from UN Headquarters] </F>
  [Text] On 17 June, James Rubin, a spokesman for the U.S. 
mission to the United Nations stated that consultations at the 
UN Security Council are proceeding without interruptions on the 
sanction resolution against North Korea. 
  Mr. Rubin was instructed by Madeline Albright, U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations, to make this point clear. 
  This notwithstanding, Pak Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador 
to 
the United Nations, stated to reporters that the North Korean 
Government will not allow special inspections [tukbyol sachal] 
for two facilities suspected to be nuclear waste processing 
facilities. 
  On 16 June, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci said: 
As a way to a general solution of the situation, North Korea 
expressed its willingness to completely accept safeguards 
regulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, including special 
inspections. 
  North Korean Ambassador Pak Kil-yon spurned Assistant 
Secretary of State Gallucci's remarks, stating that this was 
either Mr. Gallucci's personal interpretation or his personal 
pronouncement.

<F P=106> [Krisztina Koenen report: "South Korea Remains Calm in </F>
Nuclear Controversy"] 
  [Excerpts] Seoul, 17 June -- South Korea intends to react 
soberly to the conflict with the communist North. [passage 
omitted] 
  The government seems to agree that one must be prepared for 
anything and must react flexibly. At first, however, it seemed 
as if there were insurmountable differences between the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Democratic Party: 
While the opposition had called for compromise with the North, 
including diplomatic recognition by the United States, in the 
interest of safeguarding peace, the government party seemed to 
rely on a policy of strength. The opposition assumes that this 
might have been supposed to be a gesture toward the military, 
which has gradually been out of politics under Kim Young-sam. 
  Strength and striving for peace are not irreconcilable, 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, one of the main actors in the 
Korean drama, said in an interview with this newspaper. 
Unfortunately, one has had to recognize that in the past, 
progress with North Korea was possible only if one negotiated 
from a position of strength. Like President Kim, Han, too, 
thinks that the military situation on the Korean peninsula is 
not more threatening than in the past. 
  The possibility that North Korea will use nuclear weapons as 
soon as it has them cannot be ruled out. And even if this does 
not happen, nuclear weapons could become a means of permanent 
blackmail. Then one must expect the danger of military 
provocations with conventional weapons to grow. However, the 
greatest threat is emanating from the international 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, which is to be expected in any 
case, if North Korea has nuclear weapons. 
  Foreign Minister Han categorically rejected criticism from 
the ranks of the opposition Democratic Party that the United 
States has reacted excessively to the North Korean refusal to 
have its nuclear facilities examined by the IAEA and is pursuing 
its own interests in the region, which are not identical to the 
South Korean interests. On the contrary, Han says, the official 
policy of the United States is characterized by great patience. 
The U.S. Administration has done everything possible to promote 
negotiations, and for North Korea it would have been very easy 
several times to give in without losing face. 
  South Korea has always advocated direct negotiations between 
the two Korean states; however, so far this has been in vain. 
North Korea rejects direct negotiations by arguing that the 
South has not signed the cease-fire agreement which put an end 
to the Korean war. Han referred to agreements that were signed 
by North and South Korea, among others one in 1992 in which they 
state that they will not acquire nuclear weapons. 
  The South Korean Government has little enthusiasm about the 
alleged private trip by former U.S. President Carter to 
Pyongyang. The opposition, on the other hand, has welcomed 
Carter's efforts for mediation. If he returns with new 
proposals from Pyongyang, they will be examined thoroughly, Han 
Sung-chu said. 
  The foreign minister expressed satisfaction about the 
international support for South Korea. So far, China's role has 
been constructive, the government in Beijing has promoted the 
negotiations in its own way. He also expressed satisfaction 
about the close cooperation with Japan. Even though Japan might 
have problems with the Korean minority who feel committed to 
North Korea, he is sure, nevertheless, that the country will 
follow the measures which the United Nations will decide, within 
the limits set by the Japanese Constitution. 
  Han thinks that at the moment an international conference on 
the issues of this region would be of little help, even though 
he does not basically reject such an event. First, the current 
conflict must be settled and only then will there be the right 
time for international discussions, the South Korean foreign 
minister said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Problems in Consciousness of Present Situation"] </F>
  [Text] People's consciousness of the present situation 
must start from the fact that it is peculiar and delicate. Most 
people are stunned by the recent moves of some students and 
people from dissident groups and the working-class domain. They 
think that awareness of the current situation by some students 
and dissidents is quite different from that of the ordinary 
people. For example, at a time when the civil defense drill was 
being staged on 15 June, some college students staged a 
demonstration opposing the drill. Seeing this, the ordinary 
people silently asked them, "which nation are you the people 
of?" From this, we can note that there is no common factor 
whatsoever in the awareness of the situation between the 
ordinary people and some students and dissidents. 
  The differences in the awareness of the situation are 
prompted by differences of opinion regarding how one should 
accept the situation taking place recently within and around us. 
There is a great possibility that acts carried out on the basis 
of such biased viewpoints may spoil the way along which the 
nation's destiny should advance, thus creating a serious problem. 
  A democratic society is a many-sided society which is not 
absolutely dominated by one particular allegation or a certain 
sense of values. In a democratic society, various different 
allegations and different ways of thinking are respected by each 
other, and are coexisting. This being the case, many allegations 
and assertions are put forward over a certain issue and 
situation, and heated debates are to take place. This is 
precisely a characteristic and merit of a democratic society. 
  In view of this, one should not merely totally blame the act 
of opposing sanctions against North Korea and calling for a 
solution to the problem through dialogue by so-called dissident 
groups; the act of some college students who staged 
demonstrations opposing the civil defense drill; and the act of 
voting to strike in an attempt to solve the worker-management 
problem by the National Alliance of Subway Workers Trade Union. 
  However, the present situation is remarkably different from 
any other one. We would like to advise them to act by taking 
this fact into consideration. Today, in the face of a 
possibility of North Korea's nuclear armament, we are discussing 
whether we should leave this as it is or not. Whether North 
Korea comes to have nuclear arms or uses the nuclear issue 
merely as a diplomatic card, we will face the danger of war 
because of unexpected events that may break out in the course of 
pushing and pulling the nuclear problem. Therefore, we should 
refrain from acting to cause such a crisis. 
  We have often witnessed from past history that optimism and 
an appeasement policy in time of a crisis rather deepened and 
expanded such a crisis. We should not forget that allegations 
and acts recently taking place within ourselves may cause and 
fan the misjudgment of the North Korean authorities, and even 
the issue of labor-management dispute, which is not directly 
related to the nuclear problem, cannot be the exception. 
  At present we are discussing the nation's fate, and are 
facing a possibility of war, though it is not great. Concurrence 
in an awareness of the present situation is needed more urgently 
than ever before, and the sense of responsibility for the result 
of one's act and an awareness of the reality are required more 
keenly than ever before.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- The North Koreans 
continue making threats against the South, claiming current 
inter-Korean relations are on "the eve of war" and blustering 
that "South Korea will be melted away." 
  Such intimidating remarks against the South appear aimed at 
two things -- solidifying the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il 
leadership and demonstrating to the world the North's 
preparedness for any emergencies. 
  Threatening that Seoul would taste "the flame of war," North 
Korea has created a war environment to calm the people's 
mounting discontent with the worsening economy and unite them 
firmly behind "great leader" Kim Il-song and "dear leader" Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Blaming South Korea and the United States for the tension 
that is fueling the possibility of war, Pyongyang asserts that 
the South and the Americans are plotting to invade North Korea 
on the pretext of the nuclear dispute. 
  Saying they will never yield to pressure from the globe's 
most powerful nation, the North Koreans want to show their 
chuche (self-reliance) ideology to the world while trying to 
ease international pressure for sanctions and buy the time 
needed to develop nuclear arms. 
  The North Korean people's discontent with their 
deteriorating 
economy poses a grave danger to the leadership of the Kims, who 
may try to overcome the problem through armed conflict, North 
Korea watchers here say. 
  The North earlier refused to permit full international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities and ruptured inter-Korean 
dialogue by threatening to wage war. 
  North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam uttered a typical 
threat against the South during a recent visit to Ukraine: 
"South Korea should know that if a war breaks out, it would be 
melted way, going to rack and ruin and an eventual end." 
  Such intimidation was repeated in a statement issued by the 
Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland on June 6 
and again during Ambassador Son Song-pil's press conference in 
Moscow on June 8. 
  Threats were also made in many commentaries carried by North 
Korea's propaganda organs. 
  The NODONG SINMUN, the official newspaper of the Workers' 
(communist) Party, blustered in an editorial in the June 13 
edition that if war broke out on the Korean peninsula, the South 
would not be safe, according to NAEWOE Press, the official North 
Korea watcher here. 
  Along with uttering threats against the South, North Korea 
is 
constantly eulogizing Kim Chong-il, calling him "an unrivaled 
military commander." 
  Its propaganda organs claim Kim Chong-il predicted not only 
an early end to the Persian Gulf war but U.N. economic 
sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  North Korea's threats against the South may be intended to 
establish firm unity among its people. But in view of the fact 
that the intimidation comes from the highest levels, with even 
senior foreign service officials uttering threats, and that 
North Korea is in a war environment, such bluster may mean "a 
realistic danger" hangs over the Korean peninsula, analysts say.

  [Text] According to Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the United 
States requested Japan to support the emergency evacuation of 
foreigners in the ROK, including U.S. citizens, when Japan 
begins to transport Japanese people in the ROK back to Japan in 
the case of an extremely tense situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  YOMIURI SHIMBUN today quoted a Japanese Government source as 
saying that, upon the request, the government is hurrying the 
revision of laws concerning the Self-Defense Force to enable the 
Self-Defense Force to dispatch its aircraft for the 
transportation of foreigners. The Japanese Government is also 
reviewing the immigration and customs process for an emergency, 
and the deployment of naval vessels for mass transportation. 
  The source said when President Clinton had a telephone 
conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Hata on 14 June, 
President Clinton conveyed his intention to build up U.S. Forces 
in the ROK and asked Japan to help transport Americans.

  [Text] Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa revealed on 19 
June that Japan is prepared to help North Korea transform North 
Korean nuclear facilities if North Korea accepts international 
nuclear inspections. Minister Kakizawa had an interview with 
NHK on 19 June and said that Japan is prepared to share the cost 
of transforming North Korean nuclear facilities into those 
producing less plutonium if North Korea resumes talks with Japan 
to normalize diplomatic ties and accepts international 
inspections on the suspected nuclear facilities. 
  Minister Kakizawa stressed that Japan's support of 
transforming the reactors should be decided through negotiations 
between Japan and North Korea and said that if the United States 
unilaterally requests Japan's support after having dialogue with 
North Korea, the Japanese Government would not be able to 
convince its people.

<F P=106> ["Sinister Intention" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Defense 
Department recently worked out "a report on the program of 
non-proliferation activities" envisaging "punishment including 
sanctions" against the "violators of non-proliferation" for the 
prevention of the proliferation of nuclear and other mass 
destruction weapons. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives voted down the 
bill of a resolution calling for an end to assistance to Japan 
in its nuclear development. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this is an unreasonable act to 
stifle anti-imperialist independent countries including the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the unjustifiable 
pretext of "non-proliferation" of nuclear and other mass 
destruction weapons, while patronizing the nuclear arms 
development in such pro-U.S. countries as Japan and Israel. 
  The analyst further says: 
  The United States is trying to stifle with a strong arm the 
DPRK that offers no problem, while keeping mum about Japan where 
nuclear armament is being accelerated, creating realistic 
danger. This is the culmination of the application of a double 
standard which fully reveals the shamelessness and duplicity of 
the United States. 
  The U.S. military threat and blackmail under the pretext of 
"non-proliferation" of nuclear and other mass destruction 
weapons are now directed against the DPRK. But they may reach 
all the other anti-imperialist independent nations tomorrow. 
  The United States intends to lord it over in the world by 
dominating developing countries by all means including threat 
with nuclear weapons. 
  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] can never be a 
means of the U.S. domination and interference. Intolerable is 
the U.S. scheme to continue monopolizing nuclear weapons by 
abusing the NPT and dominate other nations.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A senior North Korean 
official told a visiting Japanese group in Pyongyang on Friday 
it is "impossible" for North Korea to challenge the U.S. nuclear 
arsenal, officials of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said. 
The LDP officials said Hwang Chang-yop, a secretary of the 
(North) Korean Workers' Party [WPK], made the observation in a 
meeting with an LDP mission led by former Defense Agency chief 
Taku Yamasaki. 
  Hwang also reportedly told the LDP group that it is 
"meaningless" for his country to have nuclear weapons. He 
proposed an end to power diplomacy and warned that North Korea 
will retaliate if economic sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang, 
according to the LDP officials who talked with the Yamasaki 
group after the meeting in the North Korean capital. 
  Yamasaki explained Japan's commitment to the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and emphasized that a nuclear-free 
Korean peninsula is essential for peace and stability in North 
Asia, the LDP officials in Tokyo said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Strong-Arm Measures Will Not </F>
Work"] 
  [Text] The U.S. imperialists have been bringing the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a more and more dangerous 
phase of war under the pretext of our so-called nuclear issue. 
According to reports, on 17 June the U.S. Senate babbled about 
someone else's southward invasion and adopted a resolution 
urging President Clinton to beef up immediately the U.S. Forces 
occupying South Korea. This resolution, which passed a full 
session of the U.S. Senate, calls for, among other things, 
sending additional U.S. troops and fighter planes to South Korea 
and deploying an aircraft carrier-based combat unit in this 
region. This is an attempt to deploy massive aggression forces 
on the Korean peninsula and clearly discloses the U.S. 
imperialists' brigandish [kangdojok], aggressive nature. 
  They cited someone else's southward invasion and nuclear 
issue as a pretext for beefing up the forces. However, this is 
sophism which cannot convince anyone. 
  It is a well-known fact that the North's nuclear issue, a 
byproduct of the imperialists' antisocialist, anti-Republic 
maneuvers, is a falsehood that was fabricated to crush [apsal] 
our Republic. The same is true with threats of southward 
invasion. 
  Southward invasion, the nuclear issue, and other things that 
the U.S. imperialists are talking about are mere excuses to 
justify their military buildup and aggression maneuvers. 
  Under such excuses, the U.S. imperialists have already 
brought numerous aggression troops into South Korea and plan to 
move aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation, which had 
been mobilized in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, to the 
waters close to the Korean peninsula to stand by right after the 
exercise is over. They also plan to deploy aircraft carrier 
Kitty Hawk to the waters close to our country. A foreign news 
agency has disclosed that the scheduled concentration of several 
aircraft carriers in one region was part of the U.S. plan to 
beef up naval forces in Northeast Asia. Nevertheless, without 
being satisfied with this, they plan to deploy more troops and 
fighter planes and an aircraft carrier-based combat unit in 
South Korea and in its neighborhood. This proves that they plan 
to deliberately further aggravate the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to provoke a second Korea war against us at all costs. 
  If this had not been true, why should the United States have 
continuously deployed aggression forces in South Korea and in 
its neighborhood and inspected bases of the Japanese maritime 
and air Self-Defense Forces under the pretext of our so-called 
nuclear issue, which could not be used as an excuse? 
  Even though the cold war is said to be over internationally, 
the cold war has continued on the Korean peninsula because of 
the U.S. imperialists. 
  The U.S. imperialists try to launch a surprise preemptive 
strike at our Republic after deploying massive aggression forces 
under the pretext of our nuclear issue. However, military 
adventures, threats, and blackmailing can in no way frighten 
anyone else or resolve the issue. 
  The United States gave rise to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, which originated from the U.S. imperialists' 
hostile policy toward Korea. Therefore, the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula must be resolved through dialogue and 
negotiations; it can never be resolved through forcible 
pressures, threats, or blackmailing against the other side. 
  This is why people from all walks of life in the world 
denounce the U.S. imperialists for pursuing military strong-arm 
measures and strongly ask the United States to resolve the 
nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations. 
  Just like a thief turning on the victim with a club, the 
United States, which gave rise to the nuclear issue, finds fault 
with us, who are under nuclear threat, and tries to beef up 
aggression forces. This clearly shows it has no interest in 
peacefully resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
but tries to crush [apsal] our Republic by military force. 
  No strong-arm measures will work on us, who consider 
independence to be their life. 
  We have already made it clear that if the United States 
chooses to take strong-arm measures, we will take a different 
road. 
  If the United States tries to get something through military 
adventures, this will be a miscalculation. 
  The U.S. imperialists must clearly know we are ready for 
both 
dialogue and war and act with discretion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shen Guofang, PRC government spokesman, by </F>
unidentified DER SPIEGEL correspondent; place and date not 
given: "`Prevent The War'"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] There is no country that has better 
relations with North Korea than China. How dangerous is North 
Korea's nuclear potential? 
  [Shen] We maintain normal diplomatic relations with North 
Korea, but there is no nuclear cooperation. North Korea has 
declared on several occasions that it has no intention of 
developing nuclear arms. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The United States says that Kim Il-song has 
enough plutonium to build several nuclear bombs. 
  [Shen] To date, there is no proof of that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What would you advise North Korea to do to 
defuse the situation? 
  [Shen] We advocate a de-nuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula, and we are against nuclear arms, whether they are in 
North or South Korea. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What does this mean in specific political 
terms? 
  [Shen] North and South Korea must get back to the 
negotiating table. Also, the United States and the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] must continue their 
dialogue with the North. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If, however, the issue of sanctions against 
North Korea were to be brought before the UN Security Council, 
how would China decide? 
  [Shen] We are basically opposed to such problems being taken 
before the Security Council. It would only aggravate the 
situation and does not get us anywhere. We want talks. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What guarantees are there to prevent Pyongyang 
from tinkering with the bomb in the meantime? 
  [Shen] There is no proof that they have any nuclear weapons 
at all. Sanctions would only make the situation worse. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened war. Is 
North Korea bluffing, or is this to be taken seriously? 
  [Shen] All parties should show restraint and remain calm at 
the moment. A war must be prevented; it would not involve any 
advantages for anyone. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In 1961, China concluded a military mutual 
assistance pact. Will you keep it in the event of a war? 
  [Shen] It is a friendship and assistance pact, which is, of 
course, still valid today. But we should not talk of war so 
much. I am convinced that there is still enough room for a 
peaceful solution.

<F P=106> ["A DPRK FM Spokesman Says French Authorities Should Ponder </F>
Over Matters" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry [FM] answered a question put by KCNA today 
regarding the fact that the French Government has recently 
danced duet with the United States in the clamor for "sanctions" 
against the DPRK, thus aggravating the situation in Korea. 
  He said: 
  Some time ago, the French Foreign Ministry claimed "a 
decisive measure against North Korea", manifesting its official 
stand to support a UN resolution on "sanctions". 
  Earlier, during U.S. President Bill Clinton visit to France, 
the French prime minister and government officials agreed to his 
proposal for "sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  Such moves of France are aimed at preventing the "nuclear 
issue" which has become an international focal point from being 
solved through DPRK-U.S. talks, having a greater say by poking 
its nose into the matter, goading Northeast Asian countries onto 
a conflict and thereby fishing in troubled waters. 
  The situation in our country now has become extremely 
strained due to the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its 
followers. 
  Our people are making full preparations to defend the 
dignity 
and sovereignty of the country in face of the enemy's moves. 
  The French authorities cannot be ignorant of the fact that 
"sanctions" against the DPRK under such circumstances may lead 
the situation to a catastrophic phase. 
  Nevertheless, France fell in with the United States' view in 
the clamor for "sanctions" without any idea of its own and 
danced to the tune of others, edging itself into other's [words 
indistinct] for the convocation of an international conference, 
[words indistinct] to shame. Judging from this, one can see 
clearly that France is not interested at all in the question of 
defusing the present crisis on the Korean peninsula but 
persistently seeking to gratify its sinister aims. 
  We cannot but throw into question the reckless behavior of 
the French authorities. 
  We have already declared more than once that in case any 
"sanctions" should be imposed on us not only the parties taking 
the van in enforcing them but also those who back them would be 
held responsible. 
  The French authorities must know that our warning is not an 
empty word and ponder over the matter. 
  If France wants to save its face and discharge its 
responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, 
it should help toward a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation, 
instead on joining in the act of bringing the issue into 
extremes.

<F P=106> ["Projected `Emergency Security Legislative Arrangements' </F>
Opposed in Japan" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- A meeting of Japanese 
figures for thinking of the "emergency security legislative 
arrangements" and the Korean question took place in Tokyo on 
June 10. 
  Professor Motofumi Asai of Meiji Gakuin University in his 
report at the meeting titled "On the `Emergency Security 
Legislative Arrangements' and the Korean Question" said Japan's 
preparation of the "legislative arrangements" is a political 
plot aimed at turning itself into a military power, which 
involves "troop dispatch overseas" of its "Self-Defence Forces". 
He added that Japan has been increasing tensions by whipping up 
the clamour about "a nuclear threat" from the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea in a bid to put it into effect. 
  Jiro Suzuki, an honorary professor of Tokyo Metropolitan 
University, made a report titled "On the Human Rights of Koreans 
in Japan and Discriminations Against Them". He said "sanctions" 
have been taken in Japan in the form of crackdown on Koreans in 
Japan, while politicians are crying for the "emergency security 
legislative arrangements" and "sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  An appeal opposing the "emergency security legislative 
arrangements" and calling for a peaceful solution of the Korean 
question was adopted at the meeting. 
  Saying the Japanese Government authorities' preparation of 
the "legislative arrangements", choosing the DPRK as an 
imaginary "enemy", is an extremely dangerous anti-peace, 
anti-democratic move, the appeal strongly urged them to give up 
the preparation and strictly control criminal acts against 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.

<F P=106> ["Impudent Move"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
comments on the move of the Japanese authorities to be a 
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council [UNSC], 
which is becoming all the more unscrupulous. 
  Recalling that the Japanese delegate at a meeting of the 
committee on the reform of the UN Security Council formally 
declared the wish of Japan to be a permanent member, the analyst 
says: 
  This is, indeed, a ridiculous and impudent act. 
  Japan has neither qualification nor confidence for a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  Japan is, above all, an "enemy state" which has not honestly 
repented of and liquidated her blood-stained past, though 50 
years have passed since the end of the Second World War, but is 
defending and trying to justify the war of aggression committed 
by her. 
  The Japanese ruling quarters are working round the clock to 
turn Japan into a military power and arm her with nuclear 
weapons, with the tag of "enemy state" still attached to her. 
Worse still, the Japanese authorities unhesitatingly commit 
suppression of foreign citizens in Japan and their organizations 
by mobilizing power. They have instituted the "law on 
cooperation in UN peace-keeping operations" and is now hastening 
the preparation of "emergency security legislative arrangements" 
to open a broad road for aggression overseas. 
  The Japanese ruling quarters are loud-mouthed about 
"international contribution". But they must clearly understand 
that Japan still remains a target of accusation and denunciation 
by the Asian people, far from enjoying their confidence, because 
she is evading the liquidation of the past and stepping into the 
old- fashioned shoes of aggression overseas. 
  They must not impudently eye the permanent membership of the 
UN Security Council, but properly liquidate the past, first of 
all, and renounce the scheme of overseas aggression.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Crafty Trick To Conceal Nuclear </F>
Armament"] 
  [Text] The Japanese authorities are running amok with 
reckless commotion over our nuclear developments. We know this 
because they have turned up in the forefront of the U.S. 
anti-Republic international cooperative system. 
  While spreading a groundless rumor that we have manufactured 
nuclear weapons, the Japanese reactionaries are not only raving 
that international pressure and sanctions should be imposed on 
us but are also making absurd remarks that our nuclear 
development poses a threat to Japan's security. This is indeed 
ridiculous. 
  Moreover, the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to isolate 
us at the van of others by putting forward gibberish about 
international cooperative systems and so forth in international 
conferences, including the United Nations. 
  By keeping in mind certain sanctions against our Republic, 
the Japanese authorities are accelerating the formulation of 
legislative measures in a bid to establish a war system, such as 
the emergency law, and are even raving about a marine blockade. 
  This is an undisguised disclosure of the Japanese 
reactionaries' will to join the war to invade Korea by following 
the United States in an emergency. 
  The Japanese reactionaries, who are busily running wild 
joining the maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean 
puppets to crush our Republic, are spreading preposterous and 
groundless rumors and false reports about our Republic. This 
strengthens the oppression of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan and Koreans living in Japan. This is a grave 
challenge to our Republic, an independent sovereign state, and 
is the greatest infringement on human rights. In addition, this 
is an act of illegal and unjust political suppression and is a 
criminal act of excluding other nations. 
  Today the Japanese reactionaries are attempting to conceal 
the development of their nuclear weapons by adhering to crafty 
tactics on the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear development. 
  As has been exposed, Japan accelerated on a full scale the 
nuclear weapons development beginning in the fifties. As a 
result, Japan has secured all material and technological 
foundations that enable it to manufacture nuclear weapons. With 
Japan's nuclear armament being pushed ahead, worldwide vigilance 
is becoming more keen and voices of denunciation are resounding 
more highly. 
  All flowery words uttered today by the Japanese authorities 
about the peaceful use of plutonium, the three principles for 
denuclearization, and so forth, are false. The Japanese 
reactionaries needed excuses for legalizing their nuclear 
armament. Our nuclear development, fabricated by them, is one of 
such excuses. 
  Today, the Japanese authorities, shamelessly enough, are 
actively accelerating their nuclear armament under a deceitful 
signboard by laying a blame on our side. 
  The recently-exposed incident of concealment of plutonium 
capable of manufacturing nine nuclear bombs is an incident of 
plutonium concealment carried out under tacit approval of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, which is applying double 
standards in the nuclear issue, according to instructions of the 
United States. This is an actual example of Japan's accelerating 
its nuclear armament. 
  What is grave is the fact that no one knows how much 
plutonium Japan, which was branded a flagrant offender, has 
systematically concealed for scores of years during which it 
kept operating nuclear facilities. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities, shamelessly enough, 
made provoking remarks while laying the blame on us for our 
so-called nuclear development issue, claiming that a resolute 
attitude of international community is necessary, Japan's 
cooperation for sanctions when a resolution is adopted in the 
United Nations is quite natural, and so forth. This is a crafty 
tactic to prevent plutonium, which Japan has systematically 
concealed, from being exposed any more by diverting the people's 
attention to us. 
  The Japanese authorities, who accelerated nuclear armament 
by 
laying the blame on us, have now been officially recognized by 
the world as nuclear maniacs. Reality shows that nuclear threat 
comes to us from Japan, not from us to Japan. 
  Today the Japanese reactionaries are openly spreading 
remarks 
that the use of nuclear weapons is not a violation of 
international laws. This is indeed alarming. The Japanese 
reactionaries' hostile act against our Republic has reached an 
extreme pitch in collusion with the United States and the South 
Korean puppets. 
  If one attempts to gain and increase one's popularity by 
sacrificing others, such benefit and popularity will work as a 
gimlet piercing one's own eye. The Japanese reactionaries should 
precisely realize this. The more blame Japan lays on us, the 
more clearly will our innocence be proven, and the more clearly 
will Japan's dark and shameless intentions be exposed to the 
world. 
  We have already clearly stated that if Japan joins in any 
sanctions against us, whether by taking the lead or being 
dragged in, we will regard this as a declaration of war. If 
Japan turns up on the path of sanctions, at last while 
accelerating nuclear armament defying our warnings, Japan can 
never evade due punishment for this. 
  Japan should clearly realize the firm will and determination 
of our people, who dislike empty words, and should immediately 
stop its catastrophic maneuvers to become a big nuclear power 
and reckless commotions over sanctions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The ugly color of the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam who stoops to any infamy in harming fellow 
countrymen was fully revealed during his tour of Russia early 
this month. 
  During his trip, he was closeted with Yeltsin over the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK, the problem of timber workers, the 
sales of parts of weapons and the establishment of a peace 
arrangement. It was a criminal dealing down to the slightest 
detail for doing harm to the DPRK. 
  During his trip, he fully revealed his true color as a 
traitor to the nation and flunkeyist who seeks a permanent 
division of the country and the nation. 
  His criminal act culminated in entreating Russia to "join" 
in 
taking "UN sanctions" against the DPRK over the fictitious 
"nuclear issue." 
  It is intolerable that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is 
hastening nuclear arms development, not content with the 
deployment of huge quantities of U.S. nuclear weapons in South 
Korea, entreated Russia to "cooperate" in "sanctions," branding 
the DPRK as a "nuclear criminal." What is ridiculous, however, 
is that he threw a bait of "economic cooperation" to yeltsin in 
return for that. 
  The traitor promised Russia to reschedule debt service, 
taking advantage of its difficult situation under a heavy debt 
burden and asked Russia to help South Korea in kidnapping and 
taking away timber workers of the North from the far east region 
in return for that. This is an intolerable insult and challenge 
to the North. 
  This is a sinister political intrigue to satisfy his own 
interests, improve his image under the cloak of 
"humanitarianism" and drive a wedge between the DPRK and Russia. 
  While massively introducing latest weapons of mass 
destruction including the Patriot in reward for rice market 
opening to the United States against the interests of the South 
Korean farmers and frantically staging nuclear war exercises, 
Kim Yong-sam asked Russia not to sell parts of weapons to the 
DPRK. This is an open revelation of the criminal plot to 
internationally isolate and stifle the DPRK. 
  The traitor also let loose a string of ridiculous remarks, 
slandering the DPRK's proposal for establishing a peace 
arrangement and crying for the maintenance of the armistice 
system, though South Korea is not a signatory to the armistice 
agreement and has no real power and no say. This clearly shows 
that the "civilian"-veiled traitor Kim Yong-sam is a war servant 
outdistancing the preceding military dictators and the very one 
increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
  Facts show that his visit to Russia was a criminal trip to 
beg Russia to "join" in "sanctions" of the UN against the DPRK 
over its "nuclear issue" and a never-to-be-condoned flunkeyist 
treacherous trip to leave the interests and existence of the 
nation to the gamble of outside forces. 
  It is only too natural that the despicable perfidious acts 
committed by Kim Yong-sam, the political prostitute, during his 
Russian trip have encountered strong criticism from the Korean 
nation and the progressive people of the world.

<F P=106> ["S. Korea Must Rid Itself of Colonial Fetters of United </F>
States" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- If the Korean issue is 
to be settled smoothly, South Korea must rid itself of the 
fetters of U.S. colonial rule, stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The paper in a by-lined article says: 
  The U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea and 
colonial 
rule over it are the root cause of all the misfortunes of the 
Korean nation, the chief obstacle to the reunification of Korea 
and a permanent factor of war on the Korean peninsula. The 
U.S. colonial rule over South Korea is, first of all, the source 
of the disturbance of peace, the acute confrontation and 
tensions and the growing danger of nuclear war on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to 
keep South Korea under their military occupation, execute their 
aggressive strategy toward Korea, Asia and the Pacific with it 
as the bridgehead and, further, dominate the world. 
  The United States, regarding the Korean peninsula as a "test 
field of a new military strategy," is frequently staging 
provocative nuclear attack exercises against the North together 
with the South Korean puppets, posing a constant nuclear threat 
to the DPRK. This has created a very dangerous situation which 
may lead to the outbreak of nuclear war any moment on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Yet the United States shamelessly describes South Korea as 
an 
"independent state" and "friendly nation," not its colony, and 
depicts itself as the "protector," "helper" and "apostle of 
peace" for the South Korean people. This is a ridiculous 
sophism to conceal the colonial dependence of South Korea and 
its own nature as an aggressor, a plunderer and the chieftain of 
war. 
  The U.S. colonial rule over South Korea is also the chief 
obstacle to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  It is entirely due to the United States that the Korean 
nation's cause of reunification has not yet been accomplished. 
  It is the United States that has manipulated the puppets to 
bind to the chains of fascism the South Korean students and 
people who desire reunification through the alliance with 
communism and the North. It is also the United States that has 
worked out a divisive scenario for the puppets and manipulated 
them to blindly oppose the reasonable proposals of the North for 
national reunification. 
  The United States must show its will to solve the Korean 
issue by putting an end to its anachronistic military occupation 
of South Korea and colonial rule over it.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The chairman of the 
Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], Yang Hyong-sop, released a 
statement today welcoming the remarks of president of the 
Democratic Party [DP] of South Korea Yi Ki-taek at an emergency 
press conference on June 14, at which he reiterated his party's 
position of opposing "sanctions" and "pressure" against the 
fellow countrymen in the North and hoping for ensuring peace of 
the country through dialogue and negotiation and expressed his 
willingness to visit Pyongyang as "a special envoy of the 
government", if possible. 
  Saying it is only too natural that at a time when figures of 
various strata are visiting Pyongyang from other countries, 
concerned over the acute situation prevailing on the Korean 
peninsula, the president of a South Korean opposition party 
wants to visit Pyongyang to meet with fellow countrymen, Yang 
Hyong-sop said: 
  Taking note of the fact that president Yi Ki-taek, who had 
expressed the hope for a visit to Pyongyang more than once from 
the beginning of the year, expressed again his intention to 
visit Pyongyang as "a special envoy," I view this as an 
expression of the spirit national independence for averting the 
danger of war facing the nation and ushering in a bright future 
of the nation through dialogue and negotiation by pooling wisdom 
and strength of leading politicians of the North and the South. 
  So, I think that he may visit Pyongyang as the president of 
the Democratic Party or as "a special envoy." 
  We will heartily welcome his visit. Convinced that if he 
visited Pyongyang, we could seek a fair and good way of 
radically improving North-South relations in an atmosphere of 
mutual understanding and respect as fellow countrymen, I express 
the hope for his early visit to Pyongyang. 
  Anyone who is concerned over the destiny of the fellow 
countrymen, if but a little must not bar his visit aimed at 
overcoming the grave difficulties facing the nation and opening 
a new phase of reconciliation and unity of the fellow countrymen 
but offer all the necessary conditions and conveniences.

<F P=106> [`Impudent Act"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary today raps the document distributed by the South 
Korean puppet vice foreign minister at a preparatory meeting of 
the Asian regional forum held in Bankok some time ago which 
contended that the socalled "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is a 
"most serious matter" threatening the security of Northeast 
Asia, urging the need to create "a forum of dialogue for the 
security of Northeast Asia" for the purpose of "strengthening 
international and regional cooperation" to resolve the matter. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It was Japan that responded to the South Korean puppets' 
call 
most nimbly. The South Korean puppets and the Japanese 
reactionaries seek a sinister political purpose in crying for 
the creation of the "forum". 
  Through the "forum" and "dialogue" they intend to create the 
impression that the DPRK is isolated internationally and impair 
the image of our dignified republic. 
  The very ones posing a grave threat to the peace and 
security 
of Northeast Asia are the United States, and Japan and South 
Korea. Beefing up aggression forces in and around South Korea, 
the United States is screwing up tensions and threatening a 
military attack on the DPRK. And it is well known a fact that 
the South Korean puppets are zealously joining the United States 
in this racket. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are speeding up the conversion of 
Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament and 
employing every conceivable means to stage a comeback to Korea. 
  The ASEAN members and Asian and Pacific nations are 
expressing concern over this situation. 
  Through "forum" and "dialogue", the South Korean puppets and 
the Japanese reactionaries intend to cover up their criminal 
acts in threatening the peace and security of Northeast Asia and 
inveigle other Asian and Pacific nations into the anti-DPRK 
campaign. 
  What is needed for the peace and security of northeast Asia 
is to check the U.S. moves of aggression and war in the region 
as well as the Japanese reactionaries' drive for the conversion 
of Japan into a military power and its nuclear armament and its 
reinvasion moves, and the South Korean puppets' anti-DPRK 
campaign.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "A Flunkeyist Nation-Selling Regime </F>
Following Its Master's Aggressive Policy"] 
  [Text] South Korea's Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is a 
flunkeyist nation-selling regime following the aggressive policy 
of the United States. As is known, recently traitor Kim 
Yong-sam talked about the prerogative of the supreme command of 
the military and so-called decisive power and babbled as if he 
was exercising some kind of sovereign rights. This is truly 
ridiculous. 
  The world officially recognizes the fact that the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet traitor pledged to serve the United States and 
is actively following in the master's aggressive and war policy 
while dancing according to their interest. 
  South Korea's HANGYORE SINMUN wrote that without protection 
from the United States, the Kim Yong-sam puppet ruling bunch 
cannot maintain their lives forever. That is so. The Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime is a flunkeyist nation-selling regime 
which cannot exist even for a moment without the aggression, war 
policy, and protection of the United States. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring, which entrusted its life to the U.S. 
master, is earnestly requesting their protection and begging for 
the perpetual occupation of South Korea by the U.S. Forces. 
Whenever they had the opportunity, the South Korean puppets 
beautified the U.S. Forces occupying South Korea as a deterrent 
power of war and as an apostle of peace. They are also 
unhesitatingly devoting billions of dollars every year for 
maintenance to hold on to the U.S. Forces. This is a treacherous 
act that can be conducted only by the pro-U.S. flunkeyist 
nation-sellers. 
  Moreover, the Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor recently even 
entrusted South Korea as a test place of a new U.S. military 
strategy and as a military spy base for espionage activities 
against the North. 
  As is well shown in the process of bringing in the Apache 
helicopter for offensive use and Patriot missiles into South 
Korea, the Kim Yong-sam puppets are all the more degrading South 
Korea into an exhibition hall and sales market of old and new 
war equipment, and are even playing to fill the stomachs of the 
complexes of the U.S. munitions industry. 
  As is such the case of the South Korean puppet regime, since 
it is a flunkeyist nation-selling regime in which its lifeline 
is in the hands of the United States, the tyranny by the 
aggressors is being all the more promoted. This all the more 
only brings about the result of degrading South Korea into a 
dangerous hotbed of a new war and nuclear war. 
  In South Korea, which has been under the exclusive military 
control of the U.S. imperialist aggressors, there is only an 
aggravated tense situation and a smell of a strong 
powder-reeking war. 
  Currently, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is running amok 
crazily to harm the fellow countrymen by borrowing the knives of 
outside forces. Under the manipulation of the U.S. 
imperialists, the South Korean puppets are all the more 
viciously carrying out commotion of confrontation opposing us by 
finding fault with our nuclear issue. The so-called North's 
nuclear issue is a product of the antisocialist and 
anti-Republic oppressive maneuver which is being persistently 
pursued by the U.S. imperialists. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor is running amok to plot to 
harm and crush [apsal] us by advancing as a shock brigade of the 
nuclear commotion of the imperialist reactionaries. The Kim 
Yong-sam puppet traitor is begging to the U.S. master to no 
longer make compromises and is maneuvering in all directions to 
achieve the international cooperative system opposing us and 
realize sanctions. 
  One of the examples is that in November of last year, the 
Kim 
Yong-sam puppet visited the U.S. master and even devoted South 
Korea's rice market to the United States and begged to maintain 
the international cooperative system opposing us. Under the 
assumption of taking sanctions and carrying out a military 
attack against us, the Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor committed 
forces to the Rimpac joint war exercise from late May, in which 
the United States and Japan also participated. Also, for two 
weeks beginning 22 August Ulchi-Focus Lens, a joint military 
exercise of the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces and South 
Korean puppet forces, and in November, the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise, are scheduled to take place again. 
  All facts prove how much the Kim Yong-sam ring is running 
amok to commit military adventure opposing us by following the 
U.S. imperialists' aggression and war policy. Even though there 
were many nation-sellers in South Korea, there were by no means 
nation-sellers like traitor Kim Yong-sam who are running amok 
frantically to harm us by borrowing the power of outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime is truly a flunkeyist nation- 
selling treacherous group of the times, more so than the 
military dictators before him. If the Kim Yong-sam flunkeyist 
nation-selling regime remains in South Korea, which is trying to 
maintain the remainder of its dirty doomed life by depending on 
outside forces, the South Korean people will not be able to free 
themselves from the position of a colonial slave and the whole 
nation will not be able to avoid being covered with the calamity 
of a nuclear war as well. 
  The Kim Yong-sam flunkeyist nation-selling regime, which is 
bringing about a dark cloud of a nuclear war in the sacred 
territory of our fatherland by following the outside aggression 
and war policy, must be overthrown without fail.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets perpetrated provocations against the North by bringing 
heavy weapons and armed bandits into the Demilitarized Zone 
(DMZ) along the military demarcation line Friday and Saturday, 
military sources said. 
  Armed bandits of the puppet army Friday deployed recoilless 
guns in the DMZ in the central sector of the front and took a 
firing posture toward a post of the North on the opposite side, 
seriously threatening the safety of people's army soldiers. 
Some 300 puppet army soldiers entered the DMZ and created a 
terrible war atmosphere Friday and Saturday. 
  In the period from June 11 to 18, the South Korean puppets 
illegally brought a total of 4,700 armed bandits and 1,300 
vehicles intothe DMZ for war exercises, search and building of 
military setups including positions. 
  The reckless military provocations of the South Korean 
puppets in the DMZ are a deliberate and premeditated move to 
artificially aggravate the situation in this region and ncite 
North-South confrontation. 
  The South Korean puppets must refrain from rash acts, 
clearly 
mindful of the grave consequences of the aggravation of the 
situation on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Powder-Reeking Military Budget" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
lashes out at the scheme of the South Korean puppet Defence 
Ministry to drastically increase the "military budget" for next 
year by 12.5 percent above this year's. 
  The analyst says: 
  The decision of the South Korean puppets to increase 
military 
spendings with blood taxes collected from the people is an 
intolerable challenge to the entire fellow countrymen who are 
calling for peace and reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is arguing for "the inevitability of 
sanctions" against the North and staging war games in and around 
the Korean peninsula almost every day while keeping the whole 
puppet army on "an emergency alert". 
  It is not accidental that it has decided to largely increase 
military appropriations next year. It is clear that it intends 
to make a military adventure, come what may, under the pretext 
of the "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  None of the successive South Korean rulers refrained from 
seeking North-South confrontation. But there was no such a 
warmaniac as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is so maliciously and 
persistently kicking up the anti-national racket of 
confrontation and war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group seems to be hoping to get something 
from a war against the North, dancing to the anti-DPRK, 
anti-socialist tune of the U.S. masters. But, it is an act of 
an idiot who is woefully short-sighted. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group dare ignite a war, losing reason, 
it will meet a miserable end.

  [Text] Kim Ki-han, ambassador of our country, on 11 June 
paid a farewell call on (Mamadou L. Besir Kolobo), general 
secretary of the National Guidance Committee of the Sudanese 
Union of Mali-African Democratic Alliance. 
  At the meeting, the ambassador conveyed greetings from the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il to General Secretary (Mamdou L. Besir Kolobo). 
  Expressing deep appreciation for this, the general secretary 
asked the ambassador to convey his greetings and wish for long 
life to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The general secretary said that today the U.S. imperialists 
and imperialists in the West are running amok to crush [apsal 
haryogo palgwanghago] socialist Korea. 
  He said: The U.S. imperialists, together with Japan and the 
South Korean puppets, are raving about sanctions against 
socialist Korea on the pretext of a nonexistent nuclear problem 
of the DPRK. The incident of Japan's concealment of plutonium 
and oppression maneuvers against the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan are acts that should absolutely not be 
overlooked. 
  Nevertheless, the United States and the West, while 
pretending that they are not aware of such acts, are acting 
arbitrarily by raving only about the nuclear issue of the DPRK. 
The imperialists are making miscalculation. The U.S. 
imperialists cannot bring the Korean people, who firmly believe 
in justness of their cause, to their knees. The Korean people 
have attained firm single-hearted unity based on the chuche idea 
which the great His Excellency President Kim Il-song created and 
which dear His Excellency Kim Chong-il is brilliantly deepening 
and developing. No strength in the world can make the Korean 
people surrender.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Symposiums of working 
people's organizations were held to mark the lapse of 30 years 
since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  Speeches were made at the symposiums on different subjects 
such as "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's idea and theory 
of building working people's organizations is immortal grand 
programme of building mass organizations of our times", "Dear 
Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who has most 
successfully solved the question of education of young people". 
  Speakers said that from the first days of his leadership of 
the party work Comrade Kim Chong-il attached great importance to 
the work of building working people's organizations and has 
energetically led them to discharge their mission and role as 
peripheral organizations of the party. 
  Noting that the party and the revolutionary ranks have been 
cemented rockfirm as militant ranks of loyal subjects and filial 
people and the country has turned into an indestructible 
socialist power not wavering in face of any politico-ideological 
offensive and military threats of the imperialists and 
reactionaries, they said this is entirely a result of the 
tireless, energetic activities and leadership of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il.

death-defying corps loyal to the party, thereby guaranteeing a 
bright future of the party and the revolution. The five million 
young people now are firmly prepared to be guns and bombs 
defending the party and the leader with their lives no matter 
what mad wind may blow in their way, they declared.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Russian paper 
PATRIOT No. 24 devoted two whole pages to special writeups on 
the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
began working at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea [WPK]. 
  The paper carried an article titled "United in One Will" 
with 
a picture of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the study. 
  Laying a special stress on the role of the WPK at this 
juncture when the communist movement is undergoing enormous 
difficulties, the paper says: 
  Broad working masses firmly support the party's activities. 
This is because they have become convinced through their 
experience that the Workers' Party of Korea is the most 
steadfast champion of the [words indistinct] popular masses and 
the inspirer and organizer of all victories in the struggle 
against the imperialists and for the development of the national 
economy. 
  The Workers' Party of Korea will never lose the strong 
support of the people for this factor. And this means the WPK 
will not lose its vitality any time. Because its sources is 
the people. There are other factors decisive of the WPK's 
vitality. The first of them is that the party is blessed with 
wise leadership. The party's leadership has succeeded in 
ensuring its organizational inheritance. Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
an outstanding political activist, stands at the head of the 
leadership at present. 
  Today the WPK has become a powerful party whose leading 
officials and members are all united in the same faith and will 
to carry the revolutionary cause to accomplishment. 
  A steel-like discipline of the whole party acting as one man 
under the leadership of its Central Committee has been 
established in the WPK. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il are great 
practicians in socialist construction. They are also prominent 
theoreticians who know how to indicate the party's goal, its 
method of work with the masses, and the prospect of the 
development of socialist society, clearly looking forward to the 
future. 
  In Korea the people have covered and are covering the road 
indicated by the party theoretically flawless, which is a 
correct guiding compass. 
  The Korean people's cause of socialism will certainly win as 
there are the WPK and such a leader as Comrade Kim Chong-il.

most acute ever political and military confrontation with the 
U.S. imperialists hell bent on stifling the northern half of 
Korea, the message says. 
  It declares that Hanminjon will build up the independent 
driving force of the change by stepping up the awakening of the 
people to the consciousness of independence and their 
organisation under the banner of the chuche idea and accelerate 
the glorious victory of independence, democracy and

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Message of thanks of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea was 
recently conveyed to the workers and officials of the Yongsong 
associated machinery bureau who had made significant 
achievements in the production of ordered equipment. 
  The associated bureau, a powerful machine-building base, is 
proud of being a "powerful enterprise" enjoying deep trust of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  He gave highly important teachings to the bureau, guiding it 
on the spot on several occasions in order to develop it into a 
large-scale modern machinery production base. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il called at the bureau in May 1984. 
Watching the 3,000-ton press operating, he assigned it the task 
to manufacture a 10,000-ton press suited to the expanded 
economic scale. 
  Upholding this task, the workers there worked out designs of 
the large machine made up of 70,200 parts of some 3,000 kinds in 
a few months and successfully built in a little more than one 
year a 10,000-ton press which would have taken four or five 
years at ordinary pace. 
  Upon receiving a report about the completion of the 
10,000-ton press, Comrade Kim Chong-il visited the bureau again 
in March 1986 and praised the workers and officials of Yongsong 
repeatedly, saying they had done a big thing, they ere admirable 
and the bureau is, indeed, a powerful enterprise. 
  The bureau was a small machine plant which supplied parts to 
factories in the Hungnam area shortly after liberation. 
  It made a fresh start in its development after the war. 
  It was widely known as "a hero factory" by making a 510 mm 
rolling machine frame and a 1,500 HP speed reducer with highly 
efficient single-purpose machines made by it for itself at the 
end of the 50s in response to the slogan of the Workers' Party 
of Korea "iron and machinery are the king of industry [word 
indistinct]." 
  The bureau, later on, made large machine tools including a 
combined processing line of large materials, a 20-metre lathe 
and 18-metre turning lathe to reinforce its own processes. And 
it greatly contributed to the building of an independent 
national economy by producing such complicated and modern 
ordered equipment and large machines as a 3,000-ton press, 
6,000-ton press, a 10,000-ton press, a 40,000 cubic metre 
centrifugal compressor, a 4,000 HP compressor and a large wheel 
press. 
  Now the bureau is pulling full weight on the production of 
equipment for accomplishing the comprehensive mechanization of 
agriculture on a higher level, large blower of sulfuric acid and 
other equipment for fertilizer production, equipment for the 
modernisation of light industrial factories and large machines 
including Yongsong lathe no. 3 in hearty response to the 
decisions of the 1st plenary meeting of the 6th Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Monday 
recent developments toward solving the situation over North 
Korea's nuclear facilities, including possible resumption of 
talks between North korea and the United States and a summit 
between the top leaders of North and South Korea. 
  Japan welcomes the results of a visit to North Korea by 
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito said. 
  He told a press conference Japan will continue to watch the 
developments following Carter's Pyongyang trip and to make the 
utmost efforts in calling for a "serious" response from North 
Korea while maintaining close contact with the U.S. and South 
Korea. 
  Turning to Japan's proposal to assist North Korea to convert 
its present nuclear facilities to a light-water reactor, Saito 
echoed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's remarks over the weekend 
that such aid would take place if Tokyo and Pyongyang discuss 
the issue within the context of normalization talks. 
  Since Japan's economic aid for North Korea after 
normaliztaion of bilateral relations is one of the topics in the 
normalization talks, it is natural that Japan's help to convert 
to a light-water reactor will also be discussed, Saito said. 
  Japan and North Korea have not held normalization talks 
since 
November 1992 due to a stalemate over international inspections 
of North Korea's nuclear facilities.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Japan greeted with cautious 
welcome a Saturday agreement between the top leaders of North 
and South Korea on a summit meeting to defuse the current crisis 
over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said, "the fact that things have 
gone that far means a good climate has been produced. I hope 
the summit will succeed by all means." 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said he welcomed the 
news, and voiced expectations of moves toward North Korea's 
acceptance of international nuclear inspections. 
  A Foreign Ministry official concurred, saying, "that means 
the conditions are being set for a solution to the issue." 
  Earlier in the day, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
accepted North Korean President Kim Il-song's overture, agreeing 
to a summit meeting without conditions. 
  Some Japanese officials, however, hedged their welcome of 
the 
development with caution. 
  "We have seen similar moves before, but a solution has been 
prolonged," one ministry official said. 
  He said a real solution will not be found until North Korea 
fully accepts inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, the U.N. nuclear safety watchdog. 
  The official also pointed to the unofficial status of former 
President Jimmy Carter, who visited North Korea as a "private 
citizen" to seek a peaceful solution to the issue and conveyed 
the North Korean leader's proposal for a summit to Seoul. 
  He said Japan should keep close watch on Washington's 
official assessment on the results of Carter's mission.

  I believe it is important for North Korea to clear up

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network at 
0000 GMT on 19 June, in its 60-minute live roundtable discussion 
program titled "Sunday Discussion," carries an approximately 21- 
minute interview with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the 
situation on the Korean Peninsula. The program, entitled "The 
Issue of the DPRK's Suspected Nuclear Development -- What Is 
President Kim Il-song Really Thinking?," is participated in by 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Keio University professor Masao 
Okonogi, NHK Political Department reporter Ryuichi Tejima, and 
later by Serig Harrison -- according to on-screen caption -- a 
member of the Carnegie International Peace Foundation and Pak 
Su-kil -- according to on-screen caption -- director of the ROK 
Foreign and Security Affairs Research Institute, with NHK 
Commentator Takashi Yamamoto serving as moderator. 
  At 0002 GMT, after a brief video review on recent 
developments in the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Yamamoto 
introduces today's guests, explaining the program will have two 
parts with the first half placing emphasis on an interview with 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa and the second half of the program 
will be for discussions among the participants in the NHK studio 
and participants in Seoul and Washington through a satellite 
hookup. 
  Yamamoto first asks Kakizawa about his evaluation of the 
drastic change in the situation following former U.S. President 
Carter's visit to the DPRK. Kakizawa says: "In talks with 
Carter, the DPRK sent various messages such as the freezing of 
its nuclear development program and a guarantee for nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. I 
think the DPRK gave positive answers in the talks. In this 
sense, the talks have provided the basis for talks between the 
United States and the DPRK... [pauses] truly speaking there is 
the possibility that the talks will be considered as having 
paved the way for future U.S.-DPRK talks. In this sense, the 
talks were meaningful." He adds that after hearing the details 
of the talks form Carter, the Clinton administration will add 
finishing touches through diplomatic channels to what has been 
discussed between Carter and Kim Il-song. But he says it will 
take some time before the third round of U.S.- DPRK talks is 
held. 
  Asked what he thinks about the possibility of summit talks 
between South and North Korea, Kakizawa notes: "We hope that 
summit talks will materialize. But the two sides need to 
discuss at the working level details of the talks, such as 
places for them, and I think such working level talks will be 
held early next week." 
  At 0005 GMT, South Korean Foreign and Security Affairs 
Research Institute Director Pak Su-kil joins the program via a 
satellite hookup. Asked about how the South Korean Government 
views the DPRK's offer to hold summit talks. Pak, speaking in 
Korean with voiced-over simultaneous translation in Japanese, 
quotes Kim Yong- sam as accepting the DPRK's proposal to hold 
summmit talks. Pak then cites what was discussed between Kim 
Yong-sam and Carter in Seoul on 18 June. 
  In the NHK studio, Keio University professor Okonogi gives 
his view on the situation, saying Pyongyang aimed to take the 
opportunity of Carter's visit as breakthrough in the situation. 
Saying Pyongyang has turned to taking a flexible, realistic 
approach, Yamamoto asks Foreign Minister Kakizawa what he thinks 
of such an attitude. Kakizawa answers: "The DPRK has taken such 
an attitude mindful of the fact that its replacement of all of 
the fuel rods from experimental reactors has caused unexpectedly 
harsh criticism by the international community, including China. 
I think Kim Il-song must have thought that if no progress were 
made in the situation, resolutions for sanctions against the 
DPRK will be adopted at the UN Security Council [UNSC], thus 
driving Pyongyang into a corner, and that it is necessary to 
decisively provide a breakthrough, as professor Okonogi has 
said, by taking advantage of Carter's visit to Pyongyang before 
the situation becomes worse for the DPRK. But there are still 
some vague points in Pyongyang's position. Although Kim Il-song 
has reportedly proposed freezing the nuclear development 
program, I wonder what he means by freeze. He also said the DPRK 
will freeze its program if the United States extends cooperation 
in transforming its graphite-based reactor into a light-water 
reactor. But it takes much time, and I wonder who will bear the 
cost. In addition, when Pyongyang comes to accept the IAEA 
inspections, I wonder -- although there are nuclear facilities 
that are believed to be radioactive waste storage facilities -- 
whether the DPRK will accept special inspections of such 
facilities. Special inspections of such facilities enables 
the IAEA to judge whether reactors have been operated for 
nuclear development purposes in the past. Unless special 
inspections are made, the IAEA will not be able to grasp the 
facts concerning nuclear development. For this reason, I wonder 
whether the DPRK will accept special inspections." Citing Kim 
Il-song's previous remarks that the DPRK has nothing to hide 
expect military facilities, Kakizawa says: "I think, if what he 
means by military facilities are the radioactive waste storage 
facilities, there is a wide gap between the West and the DPRK in 
their views on special inspections." 
  Yamamoto says it is still unclear whether inspections will 
be made to judge whether the DPRK tried to develop nuclear 
weapons in the past, and asks Foreign Minister Kakizawa how 
Japan will deal with the issue of the DPRK's past nuclear 
development activities. Kakizawa notes: "Japan is serious about 
this issue because it considers that if the DPRK comes to 
possess nuclear weapons in the future, it would drastically 
change the framework of security in Northeast Asia and that the 
DPRK's missiles, which are under development now, would become a 
direct threat to Japan. Another concern is that if the 
DPRK should come to develop nuclear arms, it would be a serious 
blow to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] -- which is 
signed by 164 nations -- and cause distrust between NPT member 
nations." He adds that if other nations should come to possess 
nuclear weapons one after another, it would create a world trend 
that seriously runs counter to Japan's three principles of not 
making, possessing, or bringing in nuclear weapons. He then 
says: "I hope the DPRK's past nuclear development plans will 
also be included in the subject of inspections." 
  NHK reporter Tejima also asks what approach Japan will take 
in having the DPRK's past nuclear development plans inspected. 
Kakizawa says: "This will be the major issue to be solved." He 
then notes the need to make efforts to keep close ties with the 
United States and South Korea to ensure that the IAEA 
inspections will include inspections of the DPRK's past nuclear 
development activities. Asked if Japan plans to call on the 
United States to make it clear that inspections will include 
inspections of the DPRK's past development activities, Kakizawa 
says it is necessary to see based on the results of coming 
various talks between Washington and Pyongyang, reiterating 
Japan welcomes the favorable development of the situation. 
  At 0018 GMT, Carnegie International Peace Foundation member 
Serig Harrison in Washington joins the program through remote 
hookup, citing U.S. Government reaction to the outcome of 
Carter-Kim Il-song talks, stressing the effect of Japan's 
cooperation in building a light-water reactor. Kakizawa says 
"it is not easy for the government to win the people's 
consensus" on cooperation in building a light-water reactor 
because past talks between Japan and the DPRK on normalizing 
diplomatic relations ended in failure due to the DPRK's own 
convenience. Regarding the possible resumption of Japan- DPRK 
talks, Kakizawa says: "Japan always opens its door to the DPRK. 
If the DPRK wants to resume talks, Japan is willing to take its 
seat for talks." Asked whether it is necessary to continue to 
discuss sanction measures, Kakizawa says: "Although discussions 
on sanctions will be continued until the situation becomes 
clear, I think calls for sanctions at the UNSC will be toned 
down because of the DPRK's positive message." 
  As for sanctions against the DPRK, NHK reporter Tejima 
explains the major points of the sanctions proposed by the 
United States. He then asks Kakizawa what went on in his recent 
talks with Chinese leaders. Kakizawa reviews the outcome of his 
talks, explaining China's basic stand of settling the issue 
through dialogue. Citing the government as previously saying it 
will act within the limits of the Constitution, Yamamoto asks 
what it means by the limits of the Constitution. Kakizawa says 
it is necessary to discuss to what extent Japan can implement 
sanctions if they are adopted at the UNSC. 
  As the last question, Yamamoto asks Kakizawa what role Japan 
can play in settling the issue. Kakizawa says: "Since the DPRK 
seems to be placing emphasis on dialogue with the United States, 
Japan intends to exchange opinions with the United States and 
cooperate in materializing U.S.- DPRK talks." He stresses it is 
also important to keep close contact with South Korea, China, 
and Russia. At 0038 GMT, the interview with Kakizawa ends and 
he leaves the studio.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2240 GMT on 18 June, in its regular Sunday "News 
2001" newsmagazine program, carries a 37-minute discussion on 
the DPRK nuclear issue with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at 
the FNN studio in Tokyo and (Thomas Hubbard), U.S. acting 
assistant secretary of state, in Washington linked by satellite 
hookup. The program, moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and 
Megumi Sekito, also has political commentator Kenichi Takemura 
and Keio University professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi participating 
as guest commentators. 
  An interview with Foreign Minister Kakizawa begins at 2251 
GMT. Kuroiwa asks him if he feels the crisis over the DPRK has 
receded as a result of Carter's meetings with Kim. Kakizawa 
says: "We need to watch a little longer. In connection with the 
U.S.-DPRK talks, President Kim Il-song talked about freezing 
nuclear programs. But what does freezing nuclear programs mean? 
Did he mean to say he is willing to accept inspections of 
nuclear facilties including special inspections? This point 
needs to be confirmed through diplomatic channels." He adds 
even the South-North Korea summit will need to be preceded by 
working-level meetings, thus suggesting that some time will pass 
before the government can pass judgment on the situation -- on 
whether "the situation will head for better." 
  Asked about a possible UN sanctions resolution, Kakizawa 
replies: "When Secretary of State Christopher phoned me the day 
before yesterday, he clearly said the discussions on sanctions 
by the United Nations will continue." Kakizawa says he thinks 
the United States has not revised its policy on "acting in 
cooperation with other countries in putting pressure on the 
DPRK, and drawing out concessions from the country by exerting 
such pressure." 
  Moderator Kuroiwa asks again whether the United States had 
made a concession to the DPRK and has decided not to ask it 
about its development programs in the past. Kakizawa says: "I 
have heard all kinds of stories to that effect coming from the 
United States, but they have not been verified." 
  Kakizawa adds: "On holding the third U.S.-DPRK talks, there 
is the premise that the DPRK will fully accept IAEA verification 
actions, including special inspections. The special inspections 
will cover nuclear waste storage facilities. It is said that 
since some fuel rods have been removed, verifications hereafter 
will be difficult. But if inspections can be conducted on areas 
other than those currently allowed, then we will be able to find 
out about the past operation of the reactor to a certain degree." 
  The foreign minister says he wants a solution which will not 
ignore or forgive what the DPRK currently has as regards nuclear 
arms. He insists "Japan cannot accept the neighboring DPRK 
possessing nuclear arms." 
  [Editorial Report] Referring to Japan's stand on UN 
sanctions, Kakizawa states: "Our nation is always clarifying 
its stand toward attaching importance to discussions at the 
United Nations. Even if sanctions are discussed at the United 
Nations, those would not be intended to punish North Korea for 
developing its nuclear program. Rather, UN sanctions should be 
designed as the international community's message to encourage 
North Korea's return to the framework of the IAEA. In this 
sense, a consultative settlement of the issue is our final goal." 
  When asked about the possibility of U.S. concession to the 
DPRK, Kakizawa says: "No U.S. officials have formally said yet 
that the United States can tolerate North Korea's nuclear 
weapons development program." Kakizawa then calls for Japan's 
serious and thorough discussion of crisis management, saying: 
"U.S. Assistant Secretary of State [Robert] Gallucci said that 
the DPRK already has the plutonium to produce one or two nuclear 
bombs. In addition, North Korea is reportedly developing 
missiles which can reach Japan. So, we must deal with the issue 
taking into account the fact that, unlike the Gulf crisis, the 
DPRK issue is an immediate threat to Japan. However, we do not 
have to become too nervous about such provocative remarks by 
North Korea as covering Seoul with a sea of fire. What we have 
to do at the level of the public is to discuss the nation's 
crisis management as our own problem." 
  When asked whether Japan intends to open a direct dialogue 
with North Korea, Kakizawa notes that normalization talks with 
the DPRK should be resumed upon Pyongyang's request, saying: 
"Six rounds of Japanese-DPRK normalization talks have been held 
in Beijing, but the talks have been suspended since November 
1992, when the North Korean delegation stormed out of the talks. 
We have repeatedly conveyed to North Korea our position that we 
will always be happy to resume the talks; the door is always 
open." 
  Kakizawa then notes that the upcoming U.S.-North Korean 
talks 
and ROK-North Korean talks may pave the way for the resumption 
of Japanese-DPRK normalization talks. He adds that a settlement 
of the nuclear issue is the absolute prerequisite for a 
successful conclusion to the Japanese-DPRK talks, saying: "The 
Japanese-North Korean normalization talks may make considerable 
progress if North Korea freezes its nuclear development program 
and fully accepts IAEA inspections." 
  Kakizawa then touches on Japan's stand toward Kim Il-song's 
proposal for Western aid to use in replacing the DPRK's existing 
reactors with light-water reactors. He says: "I think that the 
proposal will become a major subject hereafter, and it may be 
possible for Japan to cooperate in this field. However, 
considerable progress in the normalization talks would be the 
precondition for doing that." 
  With regard to possible UN Security Council (UNSC) sanctions 
against North Korea, moderator Kuroiwa asks if Japan is ready to 
implement UNSC sanctions. In reply, Kakizawa notes: "Regarding 
the contents of such sanctions, the United States briefed us in 
advance on its proposal. Japan is not in position to disclose 
the U.S. plan, and it is difficult for us to make formal 
comments. When the UNSC approves the U.S. plan, the first phase 
of the sanctions would be imposed if North Korea demonstrates no 
cooperation to the IAEA within 30 days. I think it is quite 
certain that Japan will participate in the first phase. The 
second phase would be imposed if the DPRK continues its nuclear 
development program and remains a threat to international peace, 
and this would include a ban on remittances from Japan. But, 
the second phase has to be determined by another UNSC 
resolution. If North Korea continues to refuse IAEA inspections 
at the time of that step, Japan would have to deal with the 
issue as an immediate threat to its national security. In this 
regard, we would have to do everything that we can do even 
though the ban on remittances involves many difficulties." 
  As for tangible measures for UNSC sanctions, Kakizawa says 
that the UNSC currently plans no military actions against the 
DPRK. However, he notes that even a ban on trade can involve 
such compulsory actions as boarding searches by the military, 
and that a constitutional controversy may arise in Japan over to 
what extent Japan can take part in such actions. He states: 
"From a common- sense point of view, it would be difficult for 
Japan to mobilize the Maritime Self-Defense Force and to allow 
it to conduct boarding searches. So, I guess the focal point is 
what Japan can do in the area of logistics. At present, there 
are many legal limitations even on constitutional logistical 
operations. When legislative decisions are needed, we will have 
to wait for debates in the Diet." When asked if the government 
intends to be involved in every logistical operation, Kakizawa 
replies that "what we can do will depend on the nation's 
discussions hereafter."

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at the House of </F>

  [Text] I believe it is quite impossible for the United 
States to take the position of ignoring altogether what has 
occurred in the past. On Japan's part, as members of this 
committee just pointed out, since the production of nuclear 
weapons on the Korean peninsula represents a direct threat, we 
maintain that there is a need to continue efforts to verify even

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Monday [20 June] Japan still wants North Korea to 
come clean on its nuclear program. 
  "If nuclear weapons are created on the Korean peninsula, 
this 
would be a direct threat to Japan. It is our position to demand 
everything be made clear, including the history of operations of 
nuclear facilities," he told a House of Councillors Foreign 
Affairs Committee meeting. 
  Kakizawa indicated he does not believe the United States 
will 
drop its demand that Pyongyang give a detailed report on the 
history of its nuclear activities, given the growing prospect of 
a diplomatic solution to the crisis. 
  "I don't understand that the U.S. is ready to let the past 
pass without questions," he said. 
  Kakizawa was responding to surging optimism that a peaceful 
solution will be found to the dispute over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit last week to 
Pyongyang led to an apparent breakthrough in the crisis, opening 
the way for high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang. 
  After briefing U.S. officials over his talks last Thursday 
and Friday with North Korean President Kim Il-song, Carter told 
reporters he believes the crisis is over. 
  But Kakizawa echoed the official U.S. stance toward the 
issue, which is more cautious than Carter's upbeat tone. 
  Kakizawa said unless negotiations are conducted under 
international pressure, "There might be a possibility that North 
Korea will not make its stance clear." 
  The foreign minister said the primary arena for negotiations 
may shift from the United Nations to Washington-Pyongyang talks. 
  "The discussions at the United Nations may become low-key 
once the U.S. and North Korea start preparatory talks for 
high-level negotiations," he said. 
  While welcoming the latest developments, Kakizawa cautioned 
against unreserved optimism, pointing to the track record of 
negotiations with the communist country. 
  "The U.S. says it wants to follow up the move 
diplomatically. 
It happened once that a summit between North and South Korean 
leaders failed to materialize after a proposal."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- It cannot be denied that 
North Korea has extracted plutonium from the spent fuel of its 
nuclear reactor, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Monday. 
  Kakizawa's remarks appear to contradict Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's statement Saturday that he does not think North 
Korea possesses nuclear weapons nor intends to build an atomic 
bomb. 
  "Based on the report of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), there is no denying that North Korea has 
extracted some plutonium (from its research reactor in the 
Yongbyon complex)," Kakizawa told the House of Councillors 
Foreign Affairs Committee in response to a question. 
  Kakizawa suggested that Hata's remarks expressed 
anticipation 
of the truth of claims by North Korean President Kim Il-song 
that North Korea has neither the will nor the ability to develop 
nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Proposed economic sanctions 
against North Korea could affect Japan's imports of men's 
clothing and food from that country, business sources said 
Friday [17 June]. 
  Japan has expressed support in principle for Washington's 
draft resolution to be submitted to the UN Security Council in 
response to North Korea's refusal to permit unhampered 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  Aoyama Trading Co., a retailer of low-priced men's clothing, 
imports suits, blazers and other clothing from North Korea for 
exclusive marketing through its outlets nationwide, taking 
advantage of low labor costs in that country. Japan also 
imports mushrooms, crabs, shellfish and other food items from 
North Korea. 
  Customs-cleared imports of men's clothing from North Korea 
last year totaled about 9 billion yen, one-third of total 
Japanese imports from that country. Mushroom imports from North 
Korea last year, meanwhile, totaled 2.2 billion yen. 
  But an official of a major Japanese trading company, who 
asked to remain anonymous, said the sanctions would have only 
minimal effects on Japan's global trade. Japan-North Korea 
trade last year totaled 52.1 billion yen, only 0.1 percent of 
total Japanese trade.

  [Text] Nagasaki, June 20 KYODO -- The frequency of port 
calls in western Japan by U.S. nuclear-powered submarines has 
increased recently, apparently reflecting the tension over North 
Korea's suspected nuclear program, Maritime Self-Defense Force 
sources said Monday [20 June]. 
  The vessels may have approached North Korean coasts to 
investigate Pyongyang's military communications and various 
types of radio waves, the sources said. 
  Nuclear-powered attack submarines of the U.S. Navy made a 
record 17 calls last year at White Beach port in Japan's 
southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, according to local 
authorities. 
  Such U.S. Submarines called at sasebo port in nagasaki 
prefecture, southwestern Japan, 10 times in 1993, close to a 
record 11 calls the previous year, the authorities said. 
  Already this year, sasebo port has received visits by such 
submarines on nine occasions, they said. 
  Yokosuka port in kanagawa prefecture, eastern Japan, had 
received the largest number of calls by such vessels in the 
past, but saw only 15 visits last year, about half the annual 
figures of 1989 and 1991, they said. 
  Recently, many submarines have made port calls for only an 
hour or so on each visit, informed sources said, apparently to 
hand over data and fetch equipment needed for further 
information gathering.

  [Text] Beijing, June 18 KYODO -- Former Japanese Defense 
Minister Taku Yamasaki said Saturday that North Korea hopes to 
set up diplomatic ties with Japan, but will seek revenge if 
Tokyo supports economic sanctions against Pyongyang. 
  Yamasaki arrived in Beijing on Saturday after holding four 
days of discussions on the nuclear issue in North Korea with Kim 
Yong-son and Hwang Chang-yop, both secretaries of the Workers' 
Party, and Kim Chang-kon, vice director of the party's 
international department, he told reporters at Beijing airport. 
  Although the North Korean officials said Pyongyang hopes "to 
establish formal diplomatic ties with Japan as soon as 
possible," they warned Japan that revenge would be taken if 
Tokyo supports pending U.N. Security council economic sanctions, 
he said. 
  The North Korean leaders also reiterated that economic 
sanctions against Pyongyang would be regarded as "a declaration 
of war," said Yamasaki, a member of Japan's main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Yamasaki, a House of Representatives member who formerly 
headed the Defense Agency, said the North Koreans renewed a 
pledge to freeze their nuclear program, including abolishing 
their radiochemical laboratory, if their present graphite-based 
nuclear reactor is replaced by a light-water reactor. 
  North Korea is now developing a graphite reactor capable of 
producing weapons-grade plutonium, while a light-water reactor 
does not produce such plutonium. 
  Kim Yong-son told Yamasaki that International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspectors would not be allowed to inspect two 
suspected nuclear sites which North Korea has not declared to 
the IAEA because the "facilities are military facilities," he 
said. 
  Yamasaki said he did not meet former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter during his stay in Pyongyang. Carter also left North 
Korea on Saturday following a four-day visit.

  [Text] Miyazaki, June 18 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of 
the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on 
Saturday [18 June] criticized Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
remarks that Japan has the capability to produce nuclear weapons. 
  "Such remarks may create misunderstanding in the 
international community," Kono told the party's prefectural 
chapter meeting in Miyazaki, southern Japan. 
  Hata told reporters Friday it is "certainly the case that 
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not 
made them." 
  The prime minister said Japan has abstained from doing so in 
line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  "How could the prime minister make such comments when every 
nation is making efforts to resolve (the issue of) North korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program?" Kono said. 
  He also said A-bomb victims and other concerned people in 
the 
only atomic-bombed nation have a severe perception about nuclear 
weapons. 
  Hata made the comment in connection with a remark he 
reportedly made in a House of Councillors budget committee 
meeting earlier Friday. 
  It is believed to be the first time for the Japanese 
Government to directly acknowledge such potential, either in the 
Diet or publicly.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan "obviously" has the 
capability to produce nuclear weapons, a Japanese Government 
source said Monday [20 June], endorsing a similar remark made 
recently by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata amid a crisis over North 
Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  "Judging from Japan's scientific techniques and economic 
power, it is obvious," the source said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
  The source, however, said, "intention and capability are 
different. Absence of intention (to produce nuclear arms) 
should be definite." 
  "There is no need for the government to deny nor emphasize 
(such capability)," the source added. 
  Hata told reporters on Friday that "it's certainly the case 
that Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has 
not made them." 
  The premier said Japan has abstained from holding such arms 
in line with its obligations as a nonnuclear power under the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai has called Hata's 
remarks an insufficient explanation of the government's true 
position. 
  He told reporters that Japan "limits its use of nuclear 
energy to peaceful purposes, abstains from military utilization 
and does not endeavor to possess nuclear weapons technology or 
know-how."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. said 
Saturday [18 June] it has signed a contract to build a steel and 
tin producing plant worth about 20 billion yen for China's 
leading steel manufacturing plant, the Shanghai Baoshan Iron and 
Steel Complex. 
  The world's largest steelmaker said the plant, comprising a 
continuous steel annealing unit and two tin plate producing 
lines, is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1997. 
  It will be the first time for the Chinese steelmaker to 
engage in the production of tin, company officials said. 
  Consumption of tin plate has been increasing rapidly in 
China 
along with rising sales of canned food and beverages, they said. 
  Baoshan is undergoing the third phase of expansion to boost 
its annual crude steel production capacity to 10 million tons by 
the year 2000 from the present 7.2 million tons, they said. 
  The officials said the Japanese firm will provide 
engineering 
and operational training for Chinese employees at the plant. 
  The Japanese steelmaker has been providing technical 
assistance for the Baoshan plant since its construction began in 
1987.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 19 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd., Japan's 
largest comprehensive electric machinery manufacturer, will 
shift production of television chassis at its plant in Malaysia 
to Mexico, a leading business daily said Sunday. 
  According to the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, the company's 
production shift will be made to cope with the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in January. 
  The company will begin manufacturing tv chassis this summer 
at a plant in Tiajuana on the U.S.-Mexico border. Hitachi will 
aim to produce chassis for 500,000 TV sets annually during a 
five-year period, the paper said. 
  Hitachi's move is expected to facilitate other Japanese 
electric makers' plans to shift their productions to Mexico to 
avoid disadvantageous tariffs on goods manufactured outside 
North America, it added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- European and Japanese 
organizations involved in the development of fast breeder 
reactors signed an agreement Friday [17 June] pledging 
cooperation in the research and development of the 
plutonium-fueled reactor type, the Science and Technology Agency 
said. 
  Participating in the joint program are four Japanese 
organizations including the governmental Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., which operates Japan's prototype 
fast breeder reactor "Monju" in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. 
  France's Atomic Energy Agency and British Nuclear Fuel Ltd., 
both involved in the development of the European Fast Reactor 
(EFR), represent the European side. 
  Japan plans to have its first demonstration fast breeder 
with 
a planned output of 660 megawatts early next century. The EFR, 
designed to generate 1,500 megawatts of electric power, is still 
in a conceptual stage. 
  In the agreement both sides pledge to promote the mutual use 
of existing research facilities to improve knowledge about 
reactor coolants, fuel and safety measures.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Monday [20 June] it 
has crafted a provisional legal framework on export controls for 
strategically-sensitive products. 
  The move follows the international scrapping of Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Control (Cocom) rules in March. 
  The Western-bloc Cocom was set up in 1949 to prevent the 
transfer of military technology to communist countries but was 
disbanded in line with the demise of the communist bloc. 
  Revisions to part of the foreign exchange control ordinance 
and the export trade control ordinance will be in effect until 
Japan and the 22 other former Cocom members work out a new 
international framework for checking exports of 
strategically-sensitive products around October, MITI said. 
  The revisions will be approved by the cabinet Tuesday and to 
be enforced on July, the ministry said. 
  Under the provisional rules, some of the former Cocom items 
regarded as especially strategically sensitive, will be subject 
to export controls for all destinations other than the 23 
countries, MITI said. 
  Among such items are cipher equipment and components for 
unmanned submarines, it said. 
  Other former Cocom-designated products will be subject to 
export controls for the "watch-list" countries of Iran, Iraq, 
Libya and North Korea. 
  Export monitoring, less strict than controls, will be 
applied 
to exports of many former Cocom items to all nations except the 
23 former Cocom members and the four watch-list countries. 
  There are no Japanese export items that are immediately 
affected by the new provisional rules, a MITI official said.

million dollars in trade and investments to South Africa over

June]. 
  Officials of the International Trade and Industry Ministry 
(MITI) said the decision, which has already been conveyed to 
South Africa, will be officially announced at the Group of Seven 
summit in Naples next month. 
  The insurance coverage is part of a package of Japanese 
measures to aid South Africa's new administration under 
President Nelson Mandela, officials said. 
  Yen-based loans will also be offered. 
  MITI officials said the decision is in response to a recent 
U.S. request that industrialized nations increase aid to 
Pretoria for its economic rehabilitation program. 
  The officials said the new insurance coverage is expected to 
generate more involvement by Japanese companies in South 
Africa's markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Australia highly 
appreciates the role Japan played in helping bring the Uruguay 
round of global trade talks to a successful conclusion, 
Australian Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe said Monday [20 
June]. 
  Howe, who doubles as housing and regional development 
minister, made the remark in a meeting with Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Howe reportedly said Australia gives high marks to Japan's 
painful but courageous decision last year to partially open its 
tightly controlled rice market to foreign competition as part of 
its efforts to conclude the global trade negotiations. 
  The Australian minister also voiced hope Japan will 
participate in an international conference planned for November 
in Melbourne, the official said. 
  The "international conference on cities and new global 
economies" will be co-hosted by the Australian Government and 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
  Hata briefed Howe on the major tasks his administration is 
currently tackling, the official said. 
  Howe asked Hata to convey views of the Asia-Pacific region 
when he attends this year's summit meeting of the Group of Seven 
major industrialized economies in Naples in July. 
  As he was leaving the premier's official residence, Howe 
described the meeting with Hata as "very good." 
  Howe arrived in Japan on Friday for a weeklong stay to hold 
talks with Japanese Government officials on regional development 
and ask for Japan's participation in the conference. He met 
with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on Monday morning.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- A Japanese Government 
advisory body Monday [20 June] proposed scrapping a law that 
limits imports of petroleum products for use by oil refiners. 
  In an interim report presented to the trade minister, the 
Petroleum Council said the provisional measures law on the 
importation of specific kinds of petroleum refined products has 
helped perpetuate substantial price gaps between the domestic 
and overseas purchase prices of gasoline and other petroleum 
products. 
  If the law is abolished as recommended, businesses such as 
trading houses will be able to import petroleum products after 
March 1996, when the law expires. 
  The report also proposed revision of petroleum storage 
regulations, in order that new entrants, such as trading houses, 
will be required to make provision for a certain level of 
petroleum stockpiling when launching an import business. 
  The report also recommended formulation of a new law 
designed 
to ensure high quality standards for imported petroleum. 
  At present, Japanese consumers pay roughly four times as 
much 
for gasoline as, for example, their U.S. counterparts. 
  The council said the latest proposal is intended to 
introduce 
a market mechanism into the Japanese petroleum industry by 
promoting competition with foreign products. 
  The step would put downward pressure on prices of petroleum 
products, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) told a press conference. 
  In order to compete with cheaper foreign products, refiners 
would be forced to make further cost-cutting efforts, which 
would in the long run reinforce their financial standing, the 
official said. 
  The proposed reform of the petroleum storage law does not 
mean that prospective importers must have a capability to 
stockpile petroleum products, he said. 
  If such a requirement is attached under the proposed import 
liberalization, it would be virtually impossible for trading 
houses to enter the oil import business, and the status quo 
would not change, the official said. 
  As one way of ensuring stockpiling as required under the new 
proposal, prospective importers could rent storage tanks from 
refiners, he suggested. 
  During Monday's Petroleum Council meeting, some council 
members voiced concern that scrapping the provisional petroleum 
import law could have negative effects on Japan's energy 
security, the MITI official said. 
  But others supported the step as "most appropriate" for 
deregulating Japan's petroleum market and the industry, he said. 
  The council report also recommended that Japan's petroleum 
distribution system be reformed to make it more efficient. 
  Specifically, the report called for more competition to be 
introduced in operation of gas stations by gradually abolishing 
a designation system for building such stations. 
  Expected restructuring of gas stations, most of them 
financially fragile, under competition policy may erode their 
profits further, but the interest of consumers should also be 
considered, the report said. 
  Operators of gas stations should listen to public criticism 
that they are providing "excessive services" at the expense of 
price attractiveness, it said. 
  The report refrained from addressing whether or not 
self-service gas stations should be allowed, saying the issue 
should be studied by the Fire Defense Agency. 
  Asked if MITI would accept an expected request by the 
refinery industry for increasing prices of kerosene, gas oil and 
other daily necessities, the official said the ministry has no 
intention to "intervene in pricing of such products during the 
era of free competition." 
  If gasoline prices fall under the proposed policy, the 
refinery industry is expected to call for raising prices of 
kerosene and gas oil, which have been set at relatively low 
levels by MITI to balance high gasoline prices in the wake of 
the oil crisis during the 1970s. 
  The petroleum council will create two working panels in 
August to study various problems involved in abolition of the 
petroleum law, including how to secure a stable amount of 
stockpiling by new entrants and to ensure high product quality, 
the MITI official said. 
  The council will work out a final report in December, the 
official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Saturday he will opt for stepping down if a no-confidence 
vote passes the Diet, ruling out a snap poll under the current 
election system which is to be replaced soon. 
  "If a no-confidence vote passes (the House of 
Representatives), I will have to dissolve the lower house or 
resign. But I have been saying the dissolution should not be 
done," Hata said in a speech in front of a Tokyo railway station. 
  "That would leave me with (the only choice of) resigning en 
masse. In that case, I would have to obtain the understanding 
of the people and of the opposition parties," he said. 
  The largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has 
pledged to submit a motion of no-confidence against Hata's 
minority cabinet after the budget bills pass the Diet, expected 
next week. 
  If the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest 
opposition party, supports the LDP's move, it will clinch the 
no- confidence vote, leaving Hata with the choice of either 
dissolving the lower house and calling snap general elections or 
stepping down with his ministers. 
  Hata has been insisting the next general elections should be 
held under a new election system of single constituencies 
combined with proportional representation in line with the 
political reform bills that passed the Diet in January. A 
government panel is currently redrawing the electoral map for 
the new system. 
  Ironically, Saturday marked the first anniversary of the 
Diet's passage of a no-confidence vote against then Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, which led to the demise of the LDP's 
38-year rule, and paved the way for a broad coalition led by 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Miyazawa lost his grip on power due to voting by Hata and 
other LDP pro-political reform lawmakers who supported the 
opposition- proposed no-confidence motion. 
  Hata left the LDP along with Ichiro Ozawa, now a top 
coalition strategist, and their followers to create Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], a key component of the coalition. 
  Hata, in recalling the day one year ago, said the move 
triggered drastic change in Japan's political landscape. 
  "I voted for the motion while saying in my mind 'please 
forgive me' because I thought I had to open up (a new era) in 
Japan's politics," he said. "I am recollecting the day with a 
heart filled with emotion."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, top 
strategist of the coalition government, said Friday [17 June] 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa does not have to testify 
about his suspected shady financial deals at the Diet. 
  Ozawa called "invalid" the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee's decision Thursday to summon Hosokawa next Tuesday. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the coalition's core 
party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, met reporters and 
criticized the decision in which Budget Committee Chairman 
Tsuruo Yamaguchi overrode the ruling coalition's objections and 
declared his panel would make Hosokawa testify under oath. 
  The opposition parties forced a motion through the lower 
house budget panel to summon Hosokawa in an apparent bid to use 
Hosokawa's plight to their advantage and force Hata's minority 
government to step down. 
  Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for 
his 
April 8 announcement of his resignation as prime minister. 
  Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the 
budget panel Wednesday to say Hosokawa has indeed paid back a 
loan of 100 million yen borrowed in 1982 from the 
scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. 
  The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, denied allegations that 
Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and 
that it was received as a secret political donation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The ruling parties urged 
House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi on Friday [17 June] 
to invalidate the lower house Budget Committee's decision to 
summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for testimony on 
his suspected personal financial deals. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's top strategist, and other 
ruling coalition officials handed over to Fukumaru Tani, 
secretary general of the lower house Secretariat, a letter of 
requests addressed to Doi, political sources said. 
  Tani was quoted as telling the officials that Doi had no 
other choice but to regard the committee decision on Thursday as 
being properly taken. 
  The coalition letter criticized lower house Budget Committee 
Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi for overriding coalition members' 
objections and declaring that Hosokawa must testify under oath 
next Tuesday. 
  The coalition officials also handed over a letter to 
Yamaguchi demanding a re-vote on the issue, the sources said. 
  The lower house Secretariat, however, has already taken 
procedures to summon Hosokawa, officials said. 
  The law for testimony of witnesses under oath in the Diet 
provides penalties of imprisonment up to a year or a fine up to 
100,000 yen against those who refuse to testify without adequate 
cause. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
the coalition's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
told reporters that Hosokawa does not have to testify, calling 
the committee decision "invalid." 
  For their part, the two largest opposition parties -- the 
Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party -- 
proposed the punishment of former Labor Minister Toshio 
Yamaguchi, an independent lower house member, saying he tried to 
throw a glass of water over Tsuruo Yamaguchi when the committee 
chairman declared that Hosokawa would be summoned. 
  The opposition parties forced the summoning motion through 
the Budget Committee in an apparent bid to use Hosokawa's case 
to their advantage and force Hata's minority government to step 
down. 
  Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for 
his 
resignation as premier in April. 
  Hosokawa's former financial secretary told the budget panel 
Wednesday that Hosokawa has paid back a 100 million yen 1982 
loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm, 
denying allegations that Hosokawa may not have repaid the money 
and that it was received as a secret political donation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- House of Representatives 
Speaker Takako Doi on Monday [20 June] rejected a plea from 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to nullify a 
parliamentary decision to summon him as a sworn witness over his 
alleged financial irregularities, officials said. 
  In a meeting with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), Doi reportedly said that the 
lower house "cannot and will not annul (the decision to summon 
him) as it has already issued a summons." 
  After the meeting, Matsuoka told reporters that it is not 
yet 
decided whether Hosokawa will appear before Tuesday's budget 
committee session. 
  Hosokawa, in a letter to the speaker, had asked the lower 
house to review the parliamentary procedures that led to his 
summoning. 
  At a session of the budget committee on Thursday, its 
chairman, Tsuruo Yamaguchi, declared that his panel unanimously 
approved a proposal to summon the former prime minister. 
  Some parties in the ruling coalition of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata lodged a protest against the procedure, saying the 
committee's decision contravened a longtime parliamentary 
practice of authorizing such summons only when all parties 
approved of such a proposal. 
  Budget committee members from the JNP and two other 
coalition 
parties, Komeito [Clean Government Party] and Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], declared at Thursday's session their opposition 
to the proposal to summon Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling 
coalition's top strategist, suggested Monday [20 June] that the 
minority government may seek an alliance with the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the coalition 
government's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, said 
the coalition continues to take priority in urging the second 
largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] to return to the ruling camp. 
  "We do not reject holding discussions simultaneously with 
other parties, because we do not have much time," Ozawa said at 
a news conference. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Monday his party will 
seek a one-shot alliance with the LDP to call for a snap poll if 
realliance talks with the ruling coalition fail. 
  The LDP has reportedly decided to propose a no-confidence 
motion against Hata as soon as the 1994 budget passes, saying 
the minority government does not represent the will of the 
people. 
  The 73.08 trillion yen budget was approved by the House of 
Representatives on June 8 and is expected to clear the House of 
Councillors during the current session ending June 29. 
  If Hata fails to survive a no-confidence vote, he either has 
to resign en masse with his cabinet or dissolve the lower house. 
  The SDP seceded from the coalition government in April after 
other ruling parties formed the parliamentary group "kaishin" 
(innovation) without consulting with the SDP.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Former Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Friday [17 June] Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's administration lacks legitimacy because 
it is a minority force in the Diet. 
  Takemura, the leader of new party Sakigake (Harbinger), made 
the remark in a meeting with a policy study group within the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), an official said. 
  "The Group New Century," headed by former Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Koichi Kato, conferred with Takemura and Yuichi 
Takami, a member of the tiny parliamentary group Democratic 
Wind, as part of a flurry of meetings among various political 
forces. 
  Takemura also remarked that the minority government cannot 
deal squarely with a host of domestic and international 
challenges, the official said. 
  In April, Hata was forced to form Japan's first minority 
government since 1955 as a result of the Social Democratic 
Party's departure from the coalition. Sakigake, an LDP splinter 
party, also opted to leave the ruling union. 
  Takemura, who served as chief cabinet secretary in the last 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, reportedly 
welcomed the ruling coalition's move to seek a tie-up with part 
of the LDP because such an attempt would have ended up in 
failure. 
  He also said the move to call together conservative forces 
is 
favorable because it will quicken the pace of an expected 
reconfiguration of political parties. 
  Kato said his group wants to continue dialogue with Sakigake 
because the two forces share views on many issues, the official 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Former Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Monday [20 June] expressed hope 
that a reconfiguration of political parties will be achieved, as 
quickly as possible, to put an end to the current political 
disarray in Japan. 
  "I don't think it is good for the political community to 
continue shaking," Takemura said in a lecture hosted by KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE. "I want to find a specific course for political 
realignment at an early date." 
  Takemura, who heads new party Sakigake [Harbinger], also 
voiced his hope that the primary opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) will split, in response to its internal differences 
over key policies and political beliefs, and merge with other 
political parties. 
  Saying the once-dominant LDP's historical role is over, 
Takemura predicted the anticipated political realignment will 
engulf the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ]), the second largest opposition 
force. 
  The leader of the 15-member new party Sakigake described the 
rule by the current minority coalition government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata as an "abnormal situation" and spoke of 
the need to form a stable majority administration in one way or 
another. 
  The SDP, the largest contingent of the government of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the ruling coalition in 
April, leaving Hata overseeing Japan's first minority government 
since 1955. 
  New party Sakigake, an LDP breakaway and also a member of 
the 
previous administration, fled the governing alliance because of 
differences with its coalition partners over political 
strategies.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The leader of Japan's 
largest labor organization expressed hope Friday [17 June] for 
an early return of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, 
SDPJ] to power and the formation of a stable government. 
  Akira Yamagishi, president of the eight million-strong 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), voiced the desire in 
a meeting with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  ''It is extremely difficult for the current administration, 
a 
weak, minority government, to push for political, administrative 
and economic reforms,'' Yamagishi told reporters following the 
meeting. 
  It was the first meeting between leaders of Rengo and the 
government since Hata took office in April. 
  The labor leader also urged Hata to take the lead in 
persuading the second largest opposition SDP, a former coalition 
party, to return to the fold and in strengthening the power base 
of his government, Yamagishi added. 
  Rengo, founded in November 1989, supports the SDP and the 
Democratic Socialist Party, a middle-of-the-road party in the 
Hata administration. 
  Hata, who heads Japan's first minority government since 
1955, 
was quoted as replying he also longs for the SDP's early return 
to power. 
  The prime minister reportedly agreed on Yamagishi's proposal 
for holding a summit between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama to discuss the SDP's possible re-entry to the coalition 
government. 
  Yamagishi also offered Hata a set of recommendations on 
major 
policy issues, including economic management, tax system reform 
and pension system reform. 
  Hata and Yamagishi agreed on the need to hold a meeting 
between the government and Rengo to build consensus on key 
policy issues.

  [Text] Washington, June 17 Kyodo -- Former Japanese Prime 
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Thursday advocated a wide alliance 
among conservative, liberal and centrist forces to create a 
stable ruling coalition. 
  Nakasone, who is on a tour of the United States, told 
reporters that such an alliance would best suit the current 
political situation. 
  ``If the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is like that, policy 
(alliance) among new conservatives, liberals, and, if necessary, 
centrist forces, may be appropriate,'' he said, referring to the 
second-largest opposition SDP's departure from the ruling 
coalition in April that left the first minority government in 
decades. 
  His remarks were viewed by observers as an indication of 
acceptance of a coalition with centrist forces such as Komeito 
and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) -- and even with some 
SDP right-wingers. 
  Nakasone, a kingpin of the largest opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), is known as a staunch conservative and 
has been leery of leftist socialists. 
  It is well known that Nakasone is seeking a coalition 
between 
the LDP and its splinter party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, as envisaged by Shinseito 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa and the LDP's Michio Watanabe, a former 
foreign minister. 
  But his latest remarks appear to show he is tilting toward a 
coalition which includes some liberal and centrist forces for at 
least the current period of transition, according to observers. 
  Nakasone also said that political realignment will progress 
in the coming months in line with the political stance of the 
parties.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A senior Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] official said on Friday [17 June] 
the party will present an alliance-seeking initiative to both 
the ruling coalition and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for 
negotiations to create a new governing coalition. 
  Koken Nosaka, who heads the Diet Administration Committee of 
the second-largest opposition party, told a press conference 
that the party will compile an alliance proposal by next 
Wednesday to present to the ruling coalition and the largest 
opposition party. 
  "We want to play a leading role in creating a stable 
government," Nosaka said. 
  Nosaka was skeptical about the possibility of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata heading the new coalition government after he 
resigns, as required by SDP's prerequisite for alliance talks. 
  "It is unthinkable" that the premier who resigns will 
immediately assume the same post again, he said. 
  Meanwhile, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made a renewed 
call 
for Hata, who heads the first minority government in four 
decades, to step down to set the stage for coalition talks with 
the SDP. 
  At a meeting with SDP-supporting labor unions, Murayama also 
said the SDP will submit a motion of no-confidence against the 
Hata cabinet if he takes a stance that it cannot agree with. 
  The SDP withdrew from the coalition in late April after the 
abrupt formation of a parliamentary group excluding the party. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono made clear the party still plans to 
seek a no-confidence vote against Hata. 
  Kono said at a meeting of party executives that the Hata 
administration has not obtained a sufficient mandate from the 
people and that it has also lost international credibility over 
the failure in the Japan-U.S. trade talks. 
  Kono also pointed to Hata's lukewarm posture toward the 
lingering corruption charges against former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa as a reason to seek a no-confidence vote. 
  Management and Coordination Agency Director General Koshiro 
Ishada, who heads Komeito, a major coalition component, said the 
SDP's move Thursday to join forces with the LDP at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee to decide to summon Hosokawa to 
testify before the Diet over the financial dealings is bound to 
have some impact on the political situation. 
  But Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, former head of 
the Democratic Socialist Party, another coalition member, said 
so far the SDP's alliance with the LDP is limited to the 
Hosokawa issue, and said it is not yet clear whether or not the 
SDP will fully cooperate with the LDP in seeking a no-confidence 
vote.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The head of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] said Monday [20 June] 
the second largest opposition party will join forces with the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form a stopgap 
government in the event the SDP's coalition talks with the 
present minority government break down. 
  Tomiichi Murayama made the comment at a meeting of former 
SDP 
lawmakers at a time when the fragile coalition led by Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata is preparing to hold talks with the SDP to 
lure it back into the fold. 
  The SDP chairman told the meeting the proposed alliance with 
the LDP would be temporary, limited to governing until House of 
Representatives general elections which may follow a threatened 
no-confidence motion by the LDP against the Hata government. 
The SDP has indicated it may support a no-confidence vote. 
  The SDP left the governing alliance in April after the 
establishment of a new parliamentary group by some coalition 
parties, excluding the SDP.

  [Text] Hiroshima, June 18 KYODO -- The head of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a ruling coalition component, 
said Saturday [18 June] that the coalition should be flexible in 
its realignment talks with former partners. 
  DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa told a news conference that an 
uncompromising stance by the coalition would lead to the 
collapse of talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social 
Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and Sakigake for their return 
to the ruling camp. 
  "If we build up high hurdles at the outset, the talks would 
lead only to breaking off," he said. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority coalition will open 
talks with the second largest opposition SDP next week to lure 
it back to the coalition and restore a stable government amid 
threats of a no- confidence motion by the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The SDP in April walked out of the broad coalition that 
supported the administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa over a move by some coalition partners to create a new 
Diet bloc without the socialists. 
  Yonezawa said the ruling coalition might make some 
concessions on the thorny issue of a consumption tax hike. 
  "We have left the issue undecided for meeting halfway with 
the SDP in the planned talks," he said. 
  The Hata administration wants to raise the consumption tax 
from the current 3 percent to secure fiscal revenues to finance 
continued tax cuts and also to reform the taxation structure in 
the face of a rapidly aging society. 
  But the SDP, which opposed the introduction of the 
value-added tax, is still dead set against any steep raise. 
  On the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
program, 
Yonezawa said the easing of tension following former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang may be of great help. 
  "The fact that (the atmosphere) is becoming considerably 
softer due to former President Carter's visit is a favorable 
factor," he said. 
  The SDP, which has a long tradition of friendly ties with 
Pyongyang, is averse to Japan taking a hard line against North 
Korea over the issue. 
  Yonezawa also said the Hata cabinet should resign rather 
than 
dissolve the House of Representatives if a no-confidence vote 
against him passes the diet. 
  "We would like to avoid elections under the current 
multiseat 
constituency system. We should seek a way toward a stable 
government through the cabinet's resignation en masse," he said. 
  The current election system is to be replaced with a new 
system of combined single-seat and proportional representation 
after a government committee finishes redrawing an electoral map 
in line with the political reform bills that passed the Diet in 
January. 
  The LDP has vowed to submit a motion of no confidence once 
the budget bills pass the diet, probably next week. 
  If the SDP supports the move, the no-confidence motion will 
be certain to clear the lower house, leaving Hata with a stark 
choice of either dissolving the lower house to call snap polls 
or stepping down with his ministers. 
  Yonezawa said if the policy-making boards of the LDP and SDP 
decide to proceed with a no-confidence vote, it will create a 
great "reaction" within the two parties, referring to possible 
defection moves.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai called on members of prime minister Tsutomu 
Hata's cabinet on Friday [17 June] to limit their fundraising 
activities, officials said. 
  The request came as Home Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii, of 
the key coalition party Shinseito, was preparing to hold a 
seminar on Sunday in Kobe for a fee of 20,000 yen per 
participant. 
  Ishii insisted that he will go ahead with the seminar, 
arguing, "It's not a fundraising party but a study session." 
  Organizers expect about 1,000 people to attend the seminar, 
at which Construction Minister Koji Morimoto and Economic 
Planning Agency chief Toshio Terasawa will deliver speeches. 
  Kumagai, also a member of Shinseito, has repeatedly urged 
Ishii to drop the plan. Ishii says the seminar was planned 
before he became home affairs minister in late April.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 Kyodo -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
pledged Friday [17 June] to take the leading role in drawing up 
full-scale, trade-related, deregulatory measures in line with 
the recent proposal by a government panel, an official at the 
Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said. 
  A set of market-opening measures recommended by the Office 
of 
Trade and Investmeent Ombudsman (OTO), an organ of the EPA, will 
form a major pillar of the government's comprehensive 
deregulation package to be released at the end of June, Hata was 
quoted as saying. 
  Hata expressed his resolve for deregulation during a meeting 
with members of the Market Access Ombudsman Council, a unit of 
the OTO, the EPA official told a press conference. 
  On May 13, the OTO presented a set of recommendations to 
Hata 
calling for the relaxing of excessive government control in 21 
areas. 
  Yoshio Okawara, Foreign Ministry adviser, who chairs the 
ombudsman council, said the OTO is designed to detect potential 
trade complaints and cope with them in a manner that would not 
cause friction with other countries, according to the EPA 
official. 
  By fully carrying out the recommended measures, Japan can 
demonstrate to the rest of the world that the country is serious 
about promoting deregulation, Okawara was quoted as saying. 
  The 21 irksome rules cited by the OTO range from extremely 
difficult driving license tests for large motorcycles and 
complex auto inspection and safety standards to strict labeling 
rules for textile products, excessive control on dairy, health 
and medical products, and rules on wheelchairs. 
  The OTO will shortly hold a meeting so that steps to address 
these complaints will be worked out by the end of this month, 
Hata said. 
  Okawara asked the government to reinforce the function of 
the 
OTO to help it cope with various complaints more effectively, 
including expanded manpower at its secretariat, the EPA official 
said. 
  The OTO was upgraded to a ministerial level under the 
previous government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which 
made deregulation a major policy goal.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 Kyodo -- The Rice Price Council is 
expected to convene soon to decide the price for the government 
purchase of this year's rice harvest, farm minister Mutsuki Kato 
said Friday [17 June]. 
  Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, told 
a 
regular press conference after a cabinet meeting the panel is 
likely to meet before the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrial nations in Naples July 8-10. 
  He said the schedule for the meeting of the council, an 
advisory panel to the head of the Food Agency, should be 
finalized early next week. 
  The meeting to decide the rice price is widely expected to 
be 
held June 30-July 1 unless affected by political developments 
after the fiscal 1994 budget passes the Diet. 
  The method of computing the price is expected to be the same 
as last year, by calculating figures taken from selected areas 
around the nation. 
  Kato also said a third round of talks among cabinet 
ministers 
to discuss farm policy following the agreement on the Uruguay 
Round of multilateral trade talks will be held next week. 
  Details of domestic farm policy in line with the agreement 
and budgetary problems are likely to be the major topics to be 
scrutinized. The last such meeting was held on April 5.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 19 KYODO -- The Farm Ministry plans to 
review its "gentan" policy of curtailing rice fields, which 
forces farmers to cut their rice acreage every year in line with 
the government's annual plan for rice supplies, government 
sources said Sunday [19 June]. 
  Under the current system introduced in 1971 to cope with a 
glut of domestic rice supplies, every rice grower is forced to 
reduce rice paddies by the same percentage to curb the total 
volume of domestically produced rice. 
  The policy, however, has been criticized for discouraging 
rice farmers who want to enhance production efficiency by 
expanding their rice fields to compete with less expensive 
foreign rice. 
  Moreover, due to an unusually cool summer last year, the 
country suffered its worst rice shortage in the postwar period, 
prompting the government to urgently import foreign rice and 
setting off a panic among consumers searching for domestic 
grains. 
  Under the new policy being considered by the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the government would set a 
target of reducing total rice acreage in each prefecture, with 
flexible consideration of each farmer's desire to produce rice, 
the sources said. 
  The government would also provide subsidies to rice growers 
meeting the annual government-set target for curtailing rice 
paddies. 
  The ministry will work out the details of the new system 
after the Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory body 
to the prime minister, submits an interim report on the future 
of Japanese agriculture in July, according to the sources.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- A growing number of rice 
retailers have decided to give up their business in the wake of 
the rice panic this spring, industry sources said Saturday [18 
June]. 
  In the panic, sparked by the shortage of domestic rice on 
shelves, many rice sellers were harassed by angry consumers and 
robbed of motivation to continue selling rice, the sources said. 
  Of about 8,000 rice retailers in Tokyo, 78 failed to renew 
their licenses for rice sales in June, a procedure required 
every three years, according to the Tokyo metropolitan 
government. 
  The number was up 34 percent from three years ago, when 58 
sellers abandoned the business. 
  But the sources said some rice retailers who did extend 
their 
licenses have handed them over to others and virtually quit. 
  According to an association of rice retailers in Tokyo, many 
of its members were discouraged by commotion during the panicky 
rice hoarding earlier this year, which resulted from a scarcity 
of domestically grown rice on the market after last year's 
devastating harvests. 
  When stocks were low and grains that were on the shelves 
were 
priced double and even triple normal costs, many consumers 
flooded rice retailers and demanded they sell rice they were 
hiding in stock, the association reported.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A government report released 
Friday [17 June] says the so-called ''land myth,'' a widespread 
faith that land prices never fail to rise in the long run, 
provided a sizable thrust to the speculation boom in the mid 
1980s that resulted in steep land price inflation. 
  The annual land white paper for 1993 argues that the myth 
added much fuel to the speculative demand for land at that time. 
  Land speculation first hit the market amid growing 
expectations of higher prices stemming from various economic 
factors, such as rising corporate earnings, lower interest rates 
and surging demand for office space, the report said. 
  In its first analysis of the speculation bubbles, the report 
says land prices eventually took a downturn mainly due to 
government emergency measures to cap them, including monetary 
and taxation curbs on speculation. 
  The experiences over the speculation frenzy and its demise, 
as well as the following recession, have changed the people's 
mind-set concerning land and deflated perennial expectations of 
ever-higher land prices. 
  But the boom leaves some unwelcome remnants, the report 
says. 
Land price inflation, for instance, has made house ownership in 
large cities out of reach for average workers, thereby dampening 
their labor incentives. 
  Moreover, the sharp downswing after the burst of the bubbles 
leaves many companies that climbed on the speculation bandwagon 
with devastating balance sheets. 
  In 1993, land prices fell for the third consecutive year, 
albeit at a slower rate than the previous two years, in 
particular in commercial districts of major cities. 
  The average price of a new condominium in the Tokyo 
Metropolitan Area that was put on the market in 1993 was 49 
million yen for a 70-square-meter unit, still 5.8 times the 
average annual income of workers in the region, the report says.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday 
said "comprehensive" sanctions against North Korea following 
reports of its decision to withdraw from the International 
Atomic and Energy Agency (IAEA) are "premature" at this point in 
time. 
  Instead, he said only "limited" sanctions, such as the 
IAEA's 
Board of Governors' decision to suspend nonmedical technical 
assistance to Pyongyang, are appropriate "at this point in time" 
because it symbolizes the concerns of the international 
community. 
  The Philippines, a member of the IAEA's Board of Governors, 
supported the 10 June resolution of the Vienna based nuclear 
watchdog on the suspension of assistance to North Korea. The 
resolution was largely symbolic because Pyongyang has never 
availed of such technical assistance. 
  "We (the Philippines) are not prepared to think of 
comprehensive sanctions at this point in time. We would rather 
encourage further dialogue between the IAEA and North Korea and 
its (Pyongyang) dialogue partners," Mr. Romulo said. 
  "Moreover, we continue to believe that China can be the 
country that can make the difference and be a moderating force 
in this rather regrettable situation on the Korean peninsula," 
he added. 
  He said the Philippines backed the IAEA action because it is 
a timely and limited measure "called for by the specifics of the 
situation" since the Stalinist North has yet to fully comply 
with current nuclear testing standards. 
  The United States, South Korea, and Japan have voiced their 
concern on the Stalinist state's refusal to comply with IAEA 
requirements on nuclear inspection of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. 
  The three have threatened to impose sanctions on North 
Korea, 
with Tokyo reportedly contemplating on a package of possible 
steps such as a ban on cash remittances and trade restrictions. 
Remittances from the Korean community in Japan to the Communist 
North is estimated to amount to over $1 billion a year. 
  The foreign affairs chief said it is important to explore 
all 
avenues for peaceful dialogue and to exhaust "every means of 
promoting" discussion before the international community resorts 
to sanctions. 
  In this light, the Philippines is against possible economic 
sanctions against North Korea. The foreign affairs chief 
considers such sanctions "comprehensive." 
  The Philippines called on North Korea to remain within the 
IAEA "for the sake of finding a peaceful solution to the issue" 
after Pyongyong declared its withdrawal from the Vienna-based 
U.N. agency. 
  Mr. Romulo, who spoke to Philippine Ambassador to Vienna 
Reynaldo Arcilla yesterday morning, clarified that the IAEA 
Secretariat has yet to receive North Korea's notice of 
withdrawal. 
  Under Article XVIII.D of the IAEA's statute, a state may 
withdraw from membership in the Vienna-based institution only if 
formal notice is given to the IAEA's depository state -- the 
United States. Until now, the IAEA Secretariat has not been 
informed by the U.S. Government of a withdrawal notice from 
North Korea. 
  It further clarified that a "State's obligations under a 
safeguards agreement with the IAEA are independent of membership 
in the organization." Thus, North Korea still remains legally 
bound by its safeguards agreement with the IAEA under the 
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) agreement.

  [Text] On 17 June, Japanese and U.S. negotiators concluded 
two days of talks in Tokyo regarding government procurement of 
telecommunications equipment in the Japan-U.S. framework trade 
talks. The negotiators held discussions on improvements in 
bidding procedures, which the Japanese Government compiled last 
spring, and on benchmarks (objective criteria) to gauge the 
openness of Japanese markets to foreign access. Apparently, 
"progress was made" (as stated by a Japanese negotiating 
official) in the talks. However, U.S. negotiators reiterated 
that they wanted to hold discussions regarding the procurement 
of telecommunications equipment by the Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation (NTT), something which Japan has rejected. 
As a result, the negotiators were unable to narrow the gap 
between their opposing views.

<F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; fourth </F>
in series entitled "Japan and the United States -- the Picture 
Shakes": "Follow Motorola"] 
  [Text] The evening of 25 May on the eve of resuming the 
stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the American 
Automobile Manufacturing Association (AAMA), a "pressure 
organization" for the Big Three, gave a party at a building near 
the U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) office. 
<H5>  City That Fulfills Wishes </H5>
  Chief executive officers (CEO) from General Motors, Ford, 
and 
Chrysler hosted the party. On the list of invitees were leading 
representatives and senators from Congress and other influential 
figures in Washington. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
was also present at the party. The AAMA held the party to 
declare to officials of the U.S. Government and members of 
Congress that it has moved its headquarters from Detroit, the 
automobile city, to Washington, a city of politics. 
  Last October, the AAMA appointed as managing director Andrew 
Card, who is well versed in the Washington situation and served 
as secretary of transportation in the Bush administration, and 
decided to move its headquarters to Washington. The AAMA has 
wielded great influence on the U.S. trade policy toward Japan by 
vigorously lobbying the administration and Congress for Japan's 
voluntary restraint on automobile exports to the United States. 
  The AAMA had a reason to move its headquarters to 
Washington. 
An American lobbyist has pointed out that "Motorola has succeed 
in prying open the Japanese carphone market through collusive 
ties with the administration, and the way Motorola has pried 
open the Japanese carphone market has become a model for other 
American corporations." When the AAMA decided to move its 
headquarters to Washington, Harold Poling, former chairman of 
Ford Motor Company, said, "Things that matter to us will be 
decided in Washington." The AAMA is trying to learn how Motorola 
has successfully pried open the Japanese carphone market and, 
according to concerned American officials in Washington, the 
major points of the strategy Motorola adopted to crack the 
Japanese market are as follows: 
  First, Motorola gains access to a certain foreign market it 
targets. Then it widely sells its competitiveness and 
technological capability and lead while surveying the 
ideosyncrasies of the foreign market. Motorola wages 
alternatively a negative campaign to taint the image of the 
foreign market and a positive campaign to sell its own image, as 
seen in the American presidential elections. 
  Second, Motorola sends its officials to key posts in the 
administration who are charged with handling trade negotiations 
and policies. Incumbent President Christopher Garbing [name as 
published] of Motorola is a member on the USTR Advisory 
Committee on Investment Policy. Assistant U.S. Trade 
Representative Ira Wolf had worked for Japan Motorola until just 
before taking his present post with the USTR. 
  Spurred by the Clinton administration's policies to bolster 
the competitiveness of American industry and promote exports of 
American products, many American industries are already showing 
their intention to embrace the strategy that has generated 
positive trade results in the semiconductor and carphone areas. 
<H5>  Japan, A Nation of Hope </H5>
  A Japanese company employee in Washington has revealed his 
sense of crisis, saying: "Recently, top executives from AT&amp;T, 
MCI and other American telecommunications companies have 
frequently visited the office of Vice President Gore. Their 
visits to the vice president's office may sow the seeds of 
future trade friction between Japan and the United States." In 
the United States, long- distance telephone companies are 
suffering a drop in profits because of the fierce price 
competition among them. Long-distance phone companies are 
lagging behing local ones CATV [cable TV] business, which is 
considered the backbone of information in the multimedia age. 
They see as a new frontier the market in Japan, which has begun 
moving toward relaxing bureaucratic regulations. There is a high 
possibility they will use the Motorola strategy as a model for 
charting their own strategies to pry open the Japanese market. 
  Mark Holland [name as published], author of the book "Top 
Management Goes To Washington," has written in the NEW YORK 
TIMES that "the Clinton administration's intervention in 
economic matters means that all American businesses can reap 
profits in Washington." With the Clinton administration trying 
to embrace trade requests from American businesses and the 
advent of American companies trying to learn from the Motorola 
strategy to crack the Japanese market, American corporations 
have further consolidated their preparedness to pry open foreign 
markets. 
  Tsuneharu Takeda, chief of the Washington Office of Itochu 
International, has pointed out: "During the Cold War era, the 
United States tolerated Japan's rejection of its trade demands 
out of security considerations. The Clinton administration, 
which was inaugurated on a platform of revitalizing the American 
economy, has no intention of tolerating Japan's rejection." 
President Clinton, who places importance on resolving domestic 
economic problems, has unequivocally stated: "In the present 
world, expanding exports is the only way for an affluent nation 
to make itself more affluent." 
<H5>  Close Government-Business Ties Result in Weakening </H5>
Competitiveness 
  In response, the Japanese Government is frantically trying 
to 
relax bureaucratic regulations, prompting the business community 
to distance itself from the government. To cite an example, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] asked 
automobile companies in late March to draw up their respective 
plans for the purchase of foreign-made auto parts. In reaction, 
top executives of several automobile companies said in distress, 
"We will no longer comply with any requests from MITI." The 
Japanese automobile industry, which has grown while maintaining 
close ties with MITI, has begun to refuse to go along with what 
MITI requests. 
  The close ties between the administration and the business 
community in the United States and the alienation of the 
business community from the government in Japan appear to carry 
the risk of causing one trade friction after another between 
Japan and the United States. The Motorola-style strategy, which 
aims to exploit the close government-business ties to let 
business use the government's influence, is nothing but a 
"strategy designed to reap short-term profits by spending money 
in Washington." The money spent in Washington would not serve to 
improve the quality of American manufactured goods, but to 
weaken American industrial competitiveness in the long run. 
There is no reason for Japanese enterprises to excessively fear 
the Motorola-style strategy.

<F P=106> [By Chirawat Na Thalang and Chiwamon Kanoksin] </F>
  [Text] A group of Thai businessmen will fly to the United 
States in the middle of next month to talk with their American 
counterparts on the setting up of the U.S.-Thai Business 
Council, which is being established to allow businessmen from 
the two countries to exchange views on how to promote future 
cooperation. 
  In preparation for the upcoming meeting, Deputy Prime 
Minister Amnuai Wirawan yesterday called a meeting with local 
businessmen, including Dr Olan Chaiprawat president of Siam 
Commerciai Bank, and Chatri Sophonphanit, executive chairman of 
Bangkok Bank Ltd, at Government House to discuss the agenda 
which the Thai delegation should raise at the upcoming meeting 
with the Americans. 
  The U.S.-Thai Business Council was initiated at a meeting 
between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
late last year, ahead of the Seattle Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation summit. The two leaders agreed that Thailand and the 
United States should have a forum to provide a discussion table 
for businessmen from the two countries to exchange views on how 
to promote bilateral activities. 
  So far, the bilateral talks between Thailand and the United 
States have been dominated by the issue of conflicts such as 
intellectual property protection and human rights, instead of 
how to seriously promote activities in business and trade. 
  An official from the U.S. Embassy said that the discussions 
will cover areas of interest to both sides. The agenda might 
include the outcome of the recently agreed Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks. He did not rule out the possibility 
that they might discuss how to liberalize trade in services. 
  The council would consist of high-level economic officials 
and representatives of the private sector. 
  After the meeting, Amnuai told the press that Bangkok and 
Washington have agreed to upgrade the existing Thai-U.S. 
Leadership Council to become the planned U.S.-Thai Business 
Council by promoting the participation of both private and 
public sectors. 
  M.R. Kasemsamoson Kasemsri, former permanent secretary to 
the 
Foreign Ministry and Thai chairman of the U.S. Thai Leadership 
Council, also proposed that the planned joint council should 
function under the supervision of the governments of the two 
sides, with about 30-50 business representatives. 
  The council should be convened once a year and the 
chairmanship will be rotated. 
  Moreover, the council should get active participation by the 
Board of Trade, Thai Bankers' Association and the Federation of 
Thai Industries. 
  Yesterday's meeting also assigned a committee, comprising 
M.R. Kasemsamoson from the state sector, and two representatives 
from the private sector to draft the agenda for next month's 
discussion, according to Chatri Sophonphanit. 
  Chatri added that the Thai delegation might have an 
opportunity to meet with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, but he 
declined to say who will represent the Thai delegation. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak was scheduled 
to 
go to the United States this month, but the schedule was 
postponed.

<F P=106> ["Address by His Excellency Chan Youran on the discussion of </F>
the two items on the agenda at the meeting of the roundtable 
commission;" in Phnom Penh on 15 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh 15 June 1994 
  The samdech royal representative: 
  I. On behalf of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] I 
would like to express the following view concerning the 
discussion of the meeting's agenda: 
  1. The cease-fire; 
  2. The minimal policy program; 
  II. Concerning the cease-fire on the meeting's agenda, the 
PDK delegation has already expressed its view in its earlier 
address, i.e. the PDK is happy to have a cease-fire now, and 
have been in the past and in the future. This is because the 
PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, is the victim. The 
PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, does not want war and 
fighting. We only want to end the war quickly and achieve 
national reconciliation and peace. We have said that it is 
necessary to have a genuine and permanent cease-fire nationwide 
with proper and adequate control. This is the issue all of us 
should discuss to seriously put together a cease-fire. Why has 
the other side refused to discuss this issue in depth? 
  The PDK holds that it is imperative to avoid using the 
cease-fire as a trick to cheat one another and the local and 
foreign public in order to continue fighting. In such a case, 
this would not be a genuine cease-fire and fighting will 
continue. Can the cease-fire be genuinely and permanently 
observed throughout the country if there is only empty talk 
about it and national reconciliation, and without any basis upon 
which all sides have agreed upon first? The entire Cambodian 
nation and people are waiting to see a genuine and permanent 
cease-fire. This is vital to them. 
  III. The first item on the agenda was raised for discussion 
at the meeting. Each side expressed its views and the meeting 
took note of all of them. Therefore, we should discuss the 
second item about the minimal policy program to set up a 
political basis for genuine national reconciliation and peace. 
  Those on the side of the two-headed government wanted to end 
the meeting half way and refused to discuss the second item on 
the minimal policy program for national reconciliation. It 
refused to discuss the national reconciliation in depth. 
National reconciliation is the key issue. The sacred goal of 
our roundtable meeting is to achieve this in accordance with the 
sacred aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people. 
  We would like to ask: Do you agree to have national 
reconciliation so that Cambodia will have genuine peace? If you 
do agree on national reconciliation and peace for Cambodia, 
there should be a discussion. The PDK holds that to reconcile 
the nation, all Cambodian sides should have a common political 
basis and decide to work together. There should be talks about 
what various sides should give one another in order to have a 
political basis that everyone can agree on. Even in business 
and investment, there are agreements and contracts that have to 
be jointly signed. To marry their offsprings, there are 
discussions among parents on what each side will give to the 
other, on the dates of the various ceremonies, and on the number 
of guests, and so on. 
  In short, the two items on the agenda -- the cease-fire and 
the minimal policy program for national reconciliation and peace 
-- are to be discussed one after another at this meeting and 
subsequent meetings of our roundtable commission because this is 
a topical issue that should be solved in accordance with the 
aspiration and call by the entire Cambodian nation and people.

<F P=106> [17 June press communique of the Royal Government </F>
spokesman's office -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In pursuance of the august idea of His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanpouk Varaman of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KOC], a 
KOC delegation took part in the roundtable commission's meeting 
with the representative of the Khmer Rouge held at the Damnak 
Chan pavilion of the royal palace, Phnom Penh, on 15 and 16 June 
1994 under the chairmanship of Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, 
high representative of the king, and in the presence of the 
samdech supreme patriarch and Samdech Mohakhousananda. 
  This roundtable commission's meeting was a continuation of 
the roundtable meeting held at the Chhanghsu-on royal residence 
on 27 and 28 May 1994 in line with the fourth provision of the 
joint communique issued by this roundtable meeting which 
proceeded under the august chairmanship of His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the venerated king of the Cambodian 
nation. 
  The presence of the KOC delegation at this latest meeting 
was 
further irrefutable proof to show that the National Assembly and 
the Royal Government, the legal institutions born out of the 
elections and the constitution, had the goodwill and most 
unshakable determination to find a peaceful solution to the 
remaining Cambodian problems with the aim of bringing peace for 
the people, because this peace constitutes the key factor for 
bringing about happiness and development in the nation in 
conformity with the august desire of the venerated king. 
  During this discussion, we once again voiced our solemn 
support for the agenda of the meeting graciously set by His 
Majesty the king on 5 June 1994: namely, 1) an unconditional, 
immediate, and permanent cease-fire in all of the territory of 
the KOC; and 2) the minimal policy program, which was a proposal 
of the Khmer Rouge. 
  The KOC delegation agreed to this cease-fire with a high 
sense of responsibility. At the same time, the delegation also 
proposed that the cease-fire should begin on 30 June 1994, at 
noon, or in the early morning of 30 June 1994. However, it was 
most regrettable that the august initiative raised by His 
Majesty the king in pleading for an unconditional, immediate, 
and permanent cease-fire in all of the territory of the KOC -- a 
most necessary and urgent requirement for the Cambodian nation 
and people -- was made conditional by the Khmer Rouge, who 
wanted to reject it once again despite the earnest pleas made by 
the samdech supreme patriarch and Samdech Mohakhousananda for 
them to accept this cease-fire. The Khmer Rouge continued to 
raise the same unreasonable and unrealistic arguments and 
demanded that the participants of the meeting divert their 
attention to discussing their proposal instead, which in reality 
was an excuse for the Khmer Rouge to carry on their "fighting 
while negotiating" strategy to prolong the war. 
  As a matter of fact, besides refusing to agree to a 
cease-fire schedule, the Khmer Rouge also ambiguously talked 
about the composition of a cease-fire supervision commission, 
using it as a condition to set the cease-fire schedule, which is 
completely contrary to the august idea of His Majesty the king 
concerning an unconditional, immediate cease-fire. 
  Moreover, the Khmer Rouge also raised the issue of a 
competent technical commission to supervise the cease-fire 
without by any means trying to specifically describe this 
commission. 
  Through this meeting with the Khmer Rouge, it could be seen 
even more clearly that the Khmer Rouge have no desire whatsoever 
to find a solution for ending the remaining Cambodian problems 
through peaceful means. The impasse resulting from the 
categorical inflexibility of the Khmer Rouge caused the 
roundtable commission's meeting to conclude on 16 June 1994, at 
noon, without any specific and positive results that could be 
used as a basis for us to agree on for the holding of further 
meetings and talks with the Khmer Rouge. This will be in line 
with the idea of His Majesty the king, who had warned before the 
meeting that he would not initiate any more roundtable meetings.

  [Text] The newsroom of the National Radio of Cambodia has 
just received a letter from the ministers of the interior 
concerning the deadline for the departure from Phnom Penh by 
representatives of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]. The 
letter reads: 
  From: The Ministers of the Interior 
  To: The Representatives of the PDK Accredited to Phnom 
Penh 
  Subject: Deadline for the PDK Representatives' Departure 
From Phnom Penh 
  The Ministry of the Interior requests that all 
representatives of the PDK and their staff immediately leave 
Phnom Penh before 19 June 1994 because the roundtable between 
the legal representatives of the Royal Government of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia and the PDK on 15 and 16 June 1994 at the royal 
palace in Phnom Penh did not produce any positive results 
regarding a cease-fire, which long has been wished for by all 
the citizens of the country; because no other meetings have been 
scheduled; because the Ministry of the Interior has learned that 
the indignant public is planning to conduct various activities 
against your group; and because the Ministry of the Interior 
cannot stop the people from being indignant, cannot forever 
ensure your security, and cannot bear full responsibility for 
any eventual accidents against your persons. 
  The Ministry of the Interior will provide safe escort for 
your group from the office to Pochentong Airport. You, however, 
must inform the Ministry at least one day before your departure. 
Beyond the above deadline, the Ministry of the Interior will 
not be held responsible for your security. 
  Please, accept our high regards. 
  Phnom Penh, 17 June 1994 
  [Signed] His Excellency Sar Kheng, His Excellency Yu 
Hokkri, ministers of the interior

group formally closed its office in Phnom Penh on Monday [20 
June] and its seven remaining officials in the capital flew to 
Thailand.

<F P=106> [From the "Political Opinion" column: "The Khmer Rouge's </F>
Only Chance"] 
  [Text] The unclear response of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] to 
the first topic in the agenda of the roundtable commission's 
meeting which required that the conflicting parties give a yes 
or no answer to the proposed cease-fire continues to cloud the 
search for peace in Cambodia. 
  Democratic Kampuchea's representative Mr. Chan Youran told 
the meeting that his party did not want to fight. He demanded 
that a real cease-fire be organized with the proper supervision 
of a committee or technical group set up for that purpose. 
Democratic Kampuchea's current stance as presented by Mr. Chan 
Youran was a little different from what it was before in that 
this time his party did not insist that other countries be 
invited to take part in the cease-fire supervision committee. 
However, it could be seen that the nature of Democratic 
Kampuchea's stance expressed at the Chhanghsu-on royal residence 
on 27-28 May remains virtually the same, as few changes have 
been made to it. 
  Democratic Kampuchea's strategy is to achieve national 
reconciliation and end the war right off, without first going 
through the stage of a cease-fire. Mr. Meas Chey, an important 
official of Democratic Kampuchea at its permanent office in 
Phnom Penh, stated outside the meeting that the main reason 
behind this Democratic Kampuchea stance was that when all 
Cambodians succeed in achieving national reconciliation, there 
would automatically be a cease-fire. He went on to say that 
otherwise a cease-fire would be ineffective, no matter where and 
when it may be, and he cited many specific examples, including 
the 1973 agreement in the U.S.-Vietnam war. For this reason, 
beginning with national reconciliation remains an important 
starting point. Although Mr. Meas Chey did not tell us what 
would be used as a basis for national reconciliation, certain 
political analysts have cautioned that Democratic Kampuchea was 
trying to push its enemies into its "Minimal Policy Program" 
trap. 
  What is Democratic Kampuchea's minimal policy program 
anyway? 
Mr. Meas Chey explained that the program was not aimed at 
dissolving the Royal Government. According to it, the two sides 
should make compromises. They should discuss what the Royal 
Government would get from Democratic Kampuchea, and vice versa. 
Yet most observers believed that Democratic Kampuchea was 
insulting the Royal Government elected by the people. 
  Although the participants expressed some cheerfulness, a 
Royal Government official who also took part in the meeting 
remained quite pessimistic. He affirmed that he still did not 
understand what the minimal policy program really was. 
  Now, through Democratic Kampuchea's "accepting while 
resolutely rejecting the cease-fire" answer, the war in Cambodia 
is still going on because what the Royal Government wants is to 
set a specific schedule for the cease-fire. Samdech Hun Sen was 
very pessimistic when it came to the future of Cambodia all 
because of the failure to declare a cease-fire schedule. 
  Recently, Samdech Hun Sen told the press that he was in 
possession of a document that was written by Pol Pot, which he 
obtained at the end of last March. According to this document, 
the objective of the Khmer Rouge was to increase their forces to 
25,000 men between May 1994 and May 1996 in preparation for an 
offensive. It should be noted that according to neutral military 
analysts, the current Khmer Rouge rebel army is believed to be 
20,000 strong, including their militia. The actual fighting 
force of the Khmer Rouge, however, is assessed to be about 8,000 
men only. 
  If the proposal for a cease-fire with a specific schedule 
fell through and the roundtable commission's meeting collapsed, 
the Khmer Rouge would surely lose more of its support. The 
Royal Government is certainly employing the Khmer Rouge's own 
game to destroy the Khmer Rouge in addition to the military aid 
from foreign countries, especially the United States, France, 
and Australia. It can equally be said that this is also a 
chance for the Khmer Rouge to make up their mind whether they 
want to end the war and launch a political attack instead, 
because to be frank the Khmer Rouge are far from finished on the 
political stage. 
  On the contrary, if this opportunity is allowed to pass by, 
the Khmer Rouge issue will then no longer belong to the 
framework of a settlement for national reconciliation and an end 
to the war. And His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk already 
warned before the roundtable commission's meeting that, should 
this meeting fail, he would not propose any more of them.

is to obtain a status of a permanent observer country. East 
Timor is not yet an independent country but we have the right to 
have an observer representation at the summit. If East Timor 
were an independent country, we would then be a country with 
full rights. We have been told by the PALOPs [Portuguese

  [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali, June 16 (OANA-ANTARA) - Indonesia 
hopes that every signatory of the General Agreement on Tariff 
and Trade (GATT) will participate in all GATT meetings, open its 
market, and abide by all GATT regulations. 
  The Indonesian hope was expressed by Coordinating Minister 
for Industry and Trade Ir. [academic title] Hartarto in his 
speech read out by his assistant, Kosim Gandataruna, during the 
closing ceremony of the 10th International Apparel Federation 
(IAF) convention here on Wednesday. 
  The minister said that in the next 10 years when the Uruguay 
Round is already completed, there would be stiffer competition 
in the domestic market. 
  "But for Indonesia, he said, "it would not then be a new 
thing as the country has already made it as a policy." 
[quotation marks as received] 
  He said we are only trying to resist now to be able to 
compete either in price or quality. 
  "Industries should do their own homework, while the 
government gives support by providing a better climate for 
investment," Hartarto said. 
  He also pointed out Indonesia's textile and its product 
(TPT) 
as one of the country's basic export goods and that it could 
well be improved for better international market competition. 
[sentence as received] 
  The IAF convention which was opened by President Suharto was 
held from June 14 to 15. It was attended by some 300 
participants from 20 IAF member countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who is Deregulation For?"] </F>
  [Text] Perhaps, Government Regulation No. 20/1994 was the 
most controversial of a series of deregulation packages. The 
regulation on foreign investment continues to generate different 
opinions even six days after it was announced. Some believe 
that the regulation has openly "sold out" Indonesia to foreign 
investors. "We are not yet ready to accept foreign investment 
to such an extent," they said. 
  The government has stated that the open doors for foreign 
investment are meant neither to sell out the country nor to 
serve the interests of a certain group. Nevertheless, the 
general public is already "scared." This is normal because 
sectors accessible by foreign investors are vital. They are 
ports, power production, transmission, and distribution, 
telecommunications, shipping, aviation, waterworks, railway, 
atomic energy generation, and even the mass media. 
  On the one hand, this deregulation package is 
understandable. 
The government seems to be all out in harnessing the available 
domestic potential to attract foreign investment. It is hoped 
that the deregulation package will enable Indonesia to compete 
with other countries which have opened their doors wider. In 
this context, Government Regulation No. 20/1994 may also serve 
as an indicator that the government has begun to feel the 
constraints of shouldering development expenses by solely 
relying on domestic funds. 
  On the other hand, however, the deregulation package has led 
to a very basic question. Is our domestic condition ready for 
it? First of all, let us see several outstanding domestic 
economic problems! First, economic sectors are confined to a 
certain business group. Second, domestic economic players lack 
competitiveness and the spirit of entrepreneurship. Third, the 
bureaucracy has yet to set regulations consistently. Fourth, 
small-scale economic players remain in the backseat. Fifth, the 
infrastructure is weak. 
  Thus, there are five problems. However, let us discuss just 
two problems. Economic sectors are confined to a certain 
business group and small-scale economic players remain in the 
backseat. Is the domestic economy ready for the influx of 
foreign investors? Won't there be an economic liberalization 
that will eventually sacrifice small-scale economic players? 
  One thing is sure. The deregulation (liberalization) package 
will lead to stronger competition among economic players in the 
country, and we know that the weak, in this case small-scale 
economic players, will surely become the victims under a very 
liberal system. In the meantime, we have yet to enact an 
anti-monopoly law although such a proposal has been made for 
several times. In that case, how should we protect our 
small-scale economic players who are already staggering?

  [Text] In response to the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's 16 June statement, the SRV Foreign Ministry 
spokesman on 17 June issued the following statement: 
  The fact that China claimed that the Tu Chinh area, which it 
calls the Wan An Reef, is part of China's Nansha [Spratly] 
islands and that China has signed agreement to explore for oil 
with the U.S. Crestone Energy Corporation in the area are in 
defiance of the principles of international law and practice, 
especially the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
  It is an undeniable fact that the Tu Chinh area lies 
entirely 
within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and its continental 
shelf. The Tu Chinh area, which China calls the Wan An Reef, and 
which Vietnam has always asserted its sovereignty over has no 
connection with the Truong Sa [Spratly] archipelagoes [khu vuwcj 
tu chinhs ma trung quoocs gooij laf vanj an bawcs nayf khoong

vieetnam] For quite some time now, Vietnam has built material 
bases and has carried out normal activities in exploring and 
exploiting natural resources in the Tu Chinh area. This act is 
totally in conformity with the international law. 
  In the interest of developing relations between Vietnam and 
China and for the interest of peace and stability in the region, 
China should not make statements or act in violation of 
Vietnam's undeniable sovereignty in this area.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- More than 160 people were 
injured, fire erupted and police were taken hostage in the most 
violent clash of President Kim Yong-sam's administration 
Saturday as collegians and activists took to the street to stop 
government ratification of the Uruguay Round (UR). 
  Over 70 students were rounded up and police said they will 
all be arrested. 
  Tension escalated from early morning when estimated 700 
students gathered at Seoul campuses to join the afternoon 
anti-UR rally. 
  Students resorted to steel pipes and wood sticks as riot 
police blocked them from going into campuses where morning 
ceremonies were planned before the march to the rally site in 
the southern part of the capital. 
  Demonstrators took 54 policemen hostage inside Hongik 
University campus [approximately 5 miles from the U.S. Embassy] 
and demanded an exchange with 20 collegians taken by police. 
  Riot troopers stormed the campus building with tear gas and 
saved the hostages but hours of confrontations continued before 
the students tried to force their way out using firebombs. 
  Rally pamphlets caught fire in the volley of firebombs and 
flame erupted at the student center but was put out in 25 
minutes. 
  Police said at least 160 people, including 110 of their men 
and 50 students were hurt and receiving hospital treatment. 
Paek Kwang-hae, a 21-year-old student, was reported to have 
suffered serious eye injury after being hit by a rock. 
  Meanwhile, the anti-UR rally opened as scheduled at 3 PM 
with 
over 7,000 ralliers. 
  "Down with Uruguay Round, repel Uruguay Round," protesters 
chanted. 
  Seoul ended up opening its rice market despite President 
Kim's campaign pledge to keep it closed. The government is set 
to ratify the UR accord in August. 
  Downtown traffic was paralyzed for throughout the afternoon 
as some 1,000 ralliers went ahead with its 5 km march.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam exchanged views with former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter on dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue upon the latter's return to Seoul on the morning 
of 18 June following a four-day visit to North Korea which 
included talks with President Kim Il-song on two occasions. 
  President Kim Yong-sam listened to former President Carter's 
explanations on the result of his visit to North Korea and 
emphasized that until President Kim Il-song proves his word, 
firm efforts based on the UN Security Council's [UNSC] sanctions 
against North must be maintained by the international society. 
  President Kim Yong-sam clearly stated that even if the 
United 
States accepts President Kim Il-song's views, it must be carried 
out at the same time as efforts for UNSC sanctions against the 
North. 
  Regarding the nuclear issue, President Kim Yong-sam pointed 
out that complete and thorough transparency must be guaranteed, 
and asserted that along with measures to freeze nuclear weapons 
in the future, past nuclear activities must be clarified. 
  While recalling that in the past, North Korea avoided the 
international society's pressure and sanctions through scheming 
tactics and promoted nuclear development while buying time, 
President Kim Yong-sam pointed out that we must not slacken the 
reins of caution until President Kim Il-song's true motives are 
confirmed. 
  President Kim Yong-sam repeatedly asked former President 
Carter not to be dazzled by President Kim Il-song's words. 
  Former President Carter explained that North Korea's will to 
accept special inspection [tukpyol sachal] includes its past 
nuclear activities. It was learned that former President Carter 
conveyed to President Kim Yong-sam the need for the ROK and the 
United States to provide assistance in switching to the light 
water reactor. 
  A high-ranking Chongwadae [presidential offices] official 
said that an overall assessment based on the former President 
Carter's remarks and the U.S. Government's material will be 
conducted. He emphasized: "Currently there is no change in the 
basic principle of completely securing North Korea's nuclear 
transparency and taking sanctions through the UNSC." 
  On 17 June, U.S. Ambassador to the ROK James Laney visited 
Chong Chong-uk, senior secretary for Foreign and National 
Security Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat, to confirm 
such matters and provided explanations to Senior Secretary Chong 
on the series of matters regarding former President Carter's 
visit to North Korea. 
  The official avoided further comment by saying, "As 
indicated by President Clinton's denial and definition of 
President Carter's remark in Pyongyang on the suspension of U.S. 
sanctions against the North, as personal opinion, the remarks 
remain merely reference material." 
  The official added that the White House has denied the 
validity of this remark of former President Carter through the 
ROK Embassy in the United States, on the morning of 17 June 
(Korean time).

  [Text] Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has held a news 
conference with domestic and foreign reporters in Panmunjom 
after visiting our country. 
  In the news conference he talked about the sincere effort 
that will be made [songuiinun noryokul kiuryo nagalte taehaeso 
marhaessupnida] for the future harmony [hwamok] between the DPRK 
and the United States, thus expressing his deep gratitude to 
President Kim Il-song for his hospitality given to him, as well 
as to his entourage. He said that his talks with President Kim 
Il-song had proceeded in an openhearted [hosimtanhoe] atmosphere. 
  Commenting on his impressions of a visit to our country, he 
said that he was very greatly moved by the art performance by 
students and children. Also, he said that the art performance 
that he watched was an outstanding performance that can never be 
forgotten in his whole life, and that he hopes that the whole 
world will be able to watch the Korean children's performance. 
  Regarding the nuclear issue and DPRK-U.S. relations, he said 
that direct talks between the DPRK and the United States will be 
resumed in the future, and that North Korea's graphite-moderated 
reactor will be converted into a light-water reactor. Also, he 
expressed the conviction that all problems regarding the nuclear 
issue would be solved smoothly. 
  Regarding the reunification of Korea, he stressed that this 
issue is the issue that should be resolved by the Korean people 
in the North and South themselves. 
  Regarding the issue of sanctions against our country, he 
said 
that the issue to take sanction steps is a very serious mistake 
[chejae chochilul chwihalttae taehan munjenun maeu simgakhan 
oryurago hamyonso], and that the sanctions will not have an 
effective influence. 
  He said he expects that the United States will no longer 
pursue the sanctions against Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter called a press conference at the Thongil House [as 
received] in the north side portion of Panmunjom today before 
leaving the DPRK. 
  He arrived in Pyongyang on June 15. 
  He told local and foreign reporters that his trip to the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea was positive. He said, 
"All my discussions with President Kim Il-song were very open, 
frank and without restraint and I think the result is positive." 
  He added that direct talks between the DPRK and the United 
States can be resumed. 
  He said North Korea's graphite moderated reactor system will 
be replaced by a light water reactor system. 
  "Overall questions about nuclear weapons can be resolved," 
he 
said. 
  He said he thinks "sanctions" are definitely a serious 
mistake. "If the things continue to go well there is no need to 
consider sanctions any more." 
  "I have never thought sanctions are effective or necessary," 
he said. "Hope now my government will agree that the crisis is 
over and the sanctions are no more necessary for consideration." 
[sentence as received] 
  Giving his impressions of Korea, he said the most exciting 
impression was made when he witnessed the performance of 
children in Pyongyang yesterday. "This was the most remarkable 
performance I have seen in my life," he added. 
  "Hope the whole world will see the children of North Korea 
as 
we appreciated yesterday," he said. [sentence as received] 
  He said he will strive with sincerity for harmony between 
the 
two countries.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter and his entourage today paid a visit to the 
Mangyongdae School Children's Palace. 
  Accompanying the guests were Vice-premier and Foreign 
Minister Kim Yong-nam and Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong 
and vice-chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], League of 
Socialist Working Youth of Korea Ham Un-kon. 
  School children warmly welcomed the guests with applause. 
  The guests saw round the indoor swimming pool, the accordion 
room and the embroidery room, hearing an explanation about the 
construction of the palace as a wonderful extramural educational 
base for school children. 
  At the embroidery room Jimmy Carter and Madame expressed 
adoration at the wisdom and talent of school children, while 
seeing the extramural activities with keen interest. 
  Embroidery room members presented a fancywork to the guests 
as a souvenir. Jimmy Carter saw the both-sided embroidery 
"Cimjongilia" and said he would keep it as an heirloom. 
  Then the guests appreciated a performance of the art circle 
members at the palace theatre. 
  At the end of the performance Carter said no children in any 
other country can match the Korean children and that this is the 
first time he saw such an admirable performance of children 
although he had toured many countries in the world. 
  Before leaving the palace, he said he would surely convey 
the 
friendly feelings of the Korean children to the American 
children. 
  Jimmy Carter and his entourage today visited the Mansudae 
Art 
Studio, combined art creation base, and the Pyongyang metro. 
  Earlier, on the 16th, they visited Pyongyang department 
store 
No. 1 and the Ognyu Restaurant and made a round of Pyongyang 
streets.

  [Text] Oita, June 19 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Sunday it will be difficult 
for Japan and the United States to reach "a complete agreement" 
in their framework trade talks by the G-7 summit meeting 
scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples. 
  At a press meeting in Oita, western Japan, Hata did not 
elaborate further, but said the two countries have already 
agreed on the direction of the trade talks. Hata also said that 
Japan would not agree to setting "numerical targets" since it 
could lead to managed trade. Japan has strongly refused U.S. 
demands to set numerical targets to measure progress in the 
opening of the Japanese market. Hata added that Japan will not 
replace "objective criteria" with numerical targests. 
  Both Japanese and U.S. officials have said they want to get 
an agreement at least on some industry sectors prior to the 
Naples summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized 
nations. A bilateral summit meeting between Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled in 
Naples. 
  The current trade talks between Japan and the U.S. focus on 
seven Japanese market sectors of particular interest to U.S. 
firms. Among them are Japanese Government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment, insurance, and 
automobiles and auto parts. 
  The two countries have also kicked off negotiations to ease 
market-access regulations in Japan's financial sector, tighten 
the protection of foreign patents and copyrights in Japan and 
increase sales of foreign-made flat glass in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Australian Deputy Prime 
Minister Brian Howe called on Japan on Monday [20 June] to 
participate in an international conference this year to discuss 
problems of cities in the Asia-Pacific region, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  Howe, also minister for housing and regional development, 
made the call in a 20-minute meeting with Japanese Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa. 
  Giving high marks to Japan's contributions in the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
Howe said he hopes Japan would participate in the "International 
Conference on Cities and New Global Economies," to be co-hosted 
by Australia and the OECD in Melbourne in November. 
  He also expressed hope that Australia and Japan could 
cooperate at another international conference on social 
development scheduled for next March in Denmark, they said. 
  Kakizawa told Howe he is interested in problems concerning 
housing and city development and said Japan would like to take 
part in the conference, according to the officials. 
  Kakizawa said he hopes Japan and Australia could continue to 
cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region and coordinate aid policies 
for the South Pacific islands. 
  He also voiced hope that summit meetings of the leaders of 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will continue 
to be held in the future, they said. 
  An informal summit of APEC leaders was held in Seattle last 
November and another summit is to be held this year in Indonesia. 
  Howe arrived in Japan last Friday to hold talks with 
Japanese 
Government officials on regional development and ask for Japan's 
participation in the conference. 
  He is to meet Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata later Monday.

  [Text] New York, June 21 KYODO -- North Korea has 
fulfilled conditions for a resumption of high-level talks with 
the United States by not diverting spent nuclear fuel to 
military purposes, according to U.N. diplomatic sources familiar 
with Washington-Pyongyang negotiations. 
  The sources said late Monday Pyongyang's First Vice Foreign 
Minister Kang Sok-chu said in a June 3 statement that North 
Korea will not divert to military use any radioactive material 
from fuel rods withdrawn recently from an experimental nuclear 
reactor. 
  In the statement, Kang asserted it is still possible to test 
the spent fuel rods to ensure that no plutonium has been 
diverted to military purposes. 
  Kang urged the U.S. to resume talks with Pyongyang in order 
to reach a package solution to the nuclear issue but also said 
economic sanctions would be regarded as a "declaration of war." 
  During refueling operations of the research reactor in the 
Yongbyon nuclear complex some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang 
last month, North Korea rejected demands by International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors that they be allowed to take 
samples from the 8,000 rods being withdrawn. 
  North Korean officials said it was setting aside 40 rods for 
testing later by the IAEA inspectors, but the Vienna-based U.N. 
monitoring agency rejected the offer as insufficient to ensure 
the continuity of the safeguards agreement. 
  The U.S. and other Western nations suspect that Pyongyang 
may be attempting to build an atomic weapons arsenal and are 
threatening U.N. sanctions if it continues to reject IAEA 
demands for checks. 
  Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful 
purposes, but its intransigence over the inspections has fueled 
suspicions it may be trying to conceal a weapons development 
program. 
  Washington is offering to resume high-level talks with 
Pyongyang but wants to see a freeze on the suspected North 
Korean nuclear program. 
  This would include allowing two IAEA inspectors to remain in 
North Korea, no reprocessing of the discharged fuel rods and no 
reloading of the Yongbyon reactor. 
  Kang suggested in the June 3 statement that when a 
comprehensive resolution to the issue is reached with the U.S., 
North Korea would allow regular and special IAEA inspections of 
its nuclear facilities, return to the nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and change to the safer light-water type of nuclear 
reactor.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan was urged by other 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrial powers over the weekend to boost 
its domestic demand, Japanese Government sources said Monday [20 
June]. 
  The prompting came at a gathering of personal 
representatives, called sherpas, of top G-7 leaders, held in 
Naples for three days from Friday, the sources said. 
  The meeting aimed to lay the groundwork for the Naples 
summit 
of G-7 nations on July 8-10. 
  The United States and other countries urged that Japan be 
mentioned by name in an economic declaration to be adopted at 
the Naples summit as a country which needs to take strong fiscal 
and monetary measures to increase domestic demand, the sources 
said. 
  During the preparatory talks, the participants agreed on the 
need to press ahead on the reform of labor markets to ensure the 
creation of job opportunities, the sources said. 
  In this connection, the U.S. and some European countries 
suggested that region-by-region macroeconomic steps be taken to 
promote employment, they said. 
  Japanese representatives balked at the demand but these 
countries maintained their tough stance toward Japan, according 
to the sources. 
  The Naples summit brings together top leaders of Britain, 
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Countries in the 
Asia-Pacific region must cooperate in the exchange of technology 
if they are to raise their living standards, a meeting of 
parliamentarians from countries in the region said Friday [17 
June]. 
  The 108 legislators from 35 countries at the Asia-Pacific 
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conference on "science and 
technology for regional sustainable development" made the call 
in a document unanimously adopted at the end of their five-day 
meeting in a Tokyo hotel. 
  The document, titled "Inventing the Future: Science and 
Technology for Sustainable Development," said the 
parliamentarians "viewed human capital as the most valuable 
resource a country can possess for its advancement." 
  But the document said the Asia-Pacific region contains the 
majority of the world's population below the poverty line and 
this can only be altered if countries in the region cooperate in 
the formation of scientific and technological partnerships aimed 
at regional sustainable growth. 
  "It is clearly recognized that there are important linkages 
between poverty, population growth and pressures on the 
environment," the document said. 
  "Poverty is indeed one of the great sources of environmental 
degradation. 
  "Any practical strategy for sustainable development demands 
that basic needs of the population be met as a matter of the 
highest priority." 
  The document said strategies to improve living standards 
should include expanding connections among business, industry 
and universities, and more emphasis on science and technology in 
government decision-making, particularly in new technologies 
like biotechnology, information sciences and bioenergy. 
  It also recommended greater involvement of women in 
scientific and technological activity. 
  Outlining the contents of the document at a press conference 
after the meeting, Goku Menon, head of the Indian delegation to 
the conference, said it focused on the uses of science and 
technology in meeting the basic needs of people in the region. 
  He said the conference was an example of the growth of 
regional ties which will lead to greater scientific and 
technological cooperation at the expense of "narrow nationalism" 
in the region.

  [Text] Australia aims to be the region's leading supporter 
of women's development programmes in anticipation of the UN 
Conference on Women in Beijing this September and the World 
Summit for Social Development in March 1995, an Australian 
official told THE NATION. 
  Priorities for this year's overseas assistance are boosting 
cooperation with non-governmental organization (NGOs) and 
enhancing small programmes that are of mutual benefit to 
countries involved, said Ellen Shipley, a counsellor in the 
Technical and Economic Cooperation Section of the Australian 
Embassy in Bangkok. 
  Australia's overseas aid programme has come under attack 
from 
its own NGOs for being too aligned with Australia's commercial 
interests at the expense of helping the poor abroad. 
  According to an embassy press statement, half of the A$ 
[Australian dollars] 1.4 billion in overseas aid earmarked in 
the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau 
(AIDAB) 1994- 1995 budget will go to 13 countries in Southeast 
Asia and the Indian subcontinent. 
  Shipley said Australia wants to cooperate better in this 
area 
because "we're located in this region -- we want to be a 
complete partner in this region." 
  She was attending a workshop here along with 30 development 
project officers from Australian embassies in 13 countries, from 
Vietnam to Pakistan. The training session was the second held 
in the past 18 months, giving participants -- a number of them 
locally hired -- a chance to exchange views and learn about 
policy development. 
  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating recently pledged 
A$350 
million over the next four years to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. 
  Hieng Sokchea, Senior Administrative Clerk in the 
Development 
Cooperation Unit of Australia's Phnom Penh Embassy, said the 
four sectors he's pinpointed were education, agriculture, health 
and infrastructure. Australian aid to Cambodia doubled to A$92 
million in the 1994-95 fiscal budget. 
  Sokchea said more than 15 bridges, costing an estimated A$10 
million, will be built along Road 5 from Phnom Penh to 
Battambang. 
  For Laos, A$48 million was promised over the next four 
years. 
One-third will go to training and human development programmes, 
while one-fifth is for infrastructure projects. 
  Vietnam's aid was doubled to A$140 million, making it the 
third top overseas recipient after Papua New Guinea and 
Indonesia. 
  For Thailand, Shipley said one third of the Bt [baht] 500 
million assistance pledged is geared toward educational 
programmes and, although there is a focus on rural programmes, 
Canberra is "looking at bigger infrastructure programmes". 
  Shipley pointed out that one of Thailand's most crucial 
problems is income disparity, so her country is supporting a new 
programme on small local NGOs that will have an impact on income 
generation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mutual Understanding Enhanced"] </F>
  [Text] The five-day official friendly visit of State Law 
and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] Chairman Senior General 
[Than Shwe] and delegation to the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR] at the invitation of the President of the LPDR, 
His Excellency Nouhak Phoumsavan, must be hailed as highly 
successful and has helped enhance mutual understanding. What is 
significant is that the two leaders and the two leaderships were 
able to have a cordial exchange of views which bespeak the 
longstanding cordial relations which have existed between the 
leaders and peoples of our two nations. 
  Sr. Gen. Than Shwe and President Nouhak Phoumsavan had a 
friendly and fruitful discussion on bilateral and international 
matters of common interest in a cordial atmosphere. In the same 
spirit, the high-level officials of the two friendly nations 
were able to hold discussions on matters of common interest and 
sign agreements of related matters. 
  The fruitful talks led to the signing of the following 
agreements: 
  1. Agreement between the Government of the Union of Myanmar 
[Burma] and the Government of the LPDR on the fixed 
International Boundary between the two countries in the Mekong 
River. 
  2. Agreement on the establishment of a Joint Commission for 
Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of the Union of 
Myanmar and the Government of the LPDR. 
  3. Agreement on Tourism Cooperation between the Government 
of the Union of Myanmar and the Government of the LPDR. 
  Moreover, the senior general, Madame Than Shwe, and the 
delegation were able to absorb the historical and cultural 
aspects of Lao life which are common to both sides, for we had 
to suffer unfortunate circumstances although we are both 
independent sovereign nations. The grace and charm of the Lao 
artistes who performed traditional dances for the benefit of the 
guests also reflect similarities between the cultures of our two 
nations. 
  We share much of the Buddhist heritage and the senior 
general 
and Madame Than Shwe as well as members of the entourage were 
able to visit pagodas and pay obeisance to the senior Lao sangha 
[Buddhist monk], present offertories and share merits. 
  It is heartening to summarize that the two sides were able 
to 
highly evaluate the success of the state visit which serves as 
firm basis for the enhancement of the friendly and 
good-neighborly relations and cooperation between the two 
countries in the future, thus contributing to the promotion of 
peace, stability, and cooperation for the development of the 
region.

  [Text] Eight members of the underground National League for 
Democracy [NLD] known as NLD-North group, comprising five 
representatives-elect of Kachin State and three NLD organizers 
who absconded to Pajao region in Kachin State returned to the 
legal fold through the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] of 
Kachin Special Region 2 in Myitkyina on 5 June. 
  The eight of them, all representatives-elect are -- U N. 
Nang 
Gam of Machambaw Township, U Yau Si of Putao Township, U Marpan 
Sin of Khawbude Township, U Kya Mya of Mohnyin Township 
Constituency-2, U Kyaw Maung of Mohnyin Township Constituency-1, 
and U Min Swe and U Ba Win, organizers of the NLD of Kyunhla 
Township, Sagaing Division, and U Thein Aung, NLD organizer of 
Pinbaw Village-Tract, Mogaung Township. Of them, U N. Nang Gam, 
U Yau Si, U Marpan Sin, and U Kya Mya are said to have been 
organized by NLD organizers in charge of Kachin State U Tin Aung 
and U Yan Naung Myint, who are presently in Manerplaw, and went 
underground from Myitkyina on 22 December 1991. They arrived in 
Pajao region. U Kyaw Maung went underground on 6 January 1992 
and followed them. U Min Swe, while serving as the township 
organizer of the Kyunhla Township NLD, came into contact with 
former teacher of Nyaungkaing Village, U Myint, and together 
with U Ba Win went underground on 9 January 1993. U Thein Aung, 
while serving as the organizer of the NLD at Bamagon Village, 
Pinbaw Village-Tract in Mogaung Township, took along with him 
Tha Din and Thaung Htwe who wanted to go underground and he also 
went underground. 
  After arriving in the jungle, they formed the Northern NLD 
group also known as Underground NLD-North group at Pajao Camp 
during the last week of January 1992. The group was formed with 
U Tin Aung as chairman, U Kya Mya as secretary, and the 
remaining seven persons as organizing committee members. On 
receipt of letter of intimation sent by Dr. Sein Win from 
Manerplaw Camp of the expatriate group NCGUB [National Coalition 
Government of the Union of Burma] about the second week of April 
1992, NLD-North Chairman U Tin Aung and member U N. Nang Gam 
left the Pajao Camp for the KNU [Karen National Union] Central 
Manerplaw Camp. On arrival at the Manerplaw Camp the National 
Council of the Union of Burma, NCUB, was formed and U Tin Aung 
was assigned the duties as secretary. U N. Nang Gam was 
attached to the NCGUB office for about one year and he became a 
member of the education committee which was formed in July 1993. 
  In September 1993, Dr. Sein Win sent for the representatives 
at Pajao Camp to come to the Manerplaw Camp in order to expand 
the NCGUB group and U Kya Mya, U Kyaw Maung, U Marpan Sin, U Yau 
Si, and organizers U Yan Naung Myint and U Thaung Htwe arrived 
at Manerplaw Camp. As expatriate Sein Win and group had left 
for the United States, they had to wait there for nothing. 
Hearing that the KIO and the Government had made peace, their 
group left Manerplaw Camp and arrived at Pajao Camp on 13 March 
1994. After holding consultations and discussions among 
themselves they completely dissolved the NLD-North group on 2 
April and after submitting the matter to the KIO leaders they 
returned to the legal fold. 
  When they arrived at the Manerplaw Camp, they learnt that 
one 
of the organizations of a foreign country provided assistance to 
Sein Win's NCGUB group. For the 1993 budget, a monetary 
assistance of 4.8 million Norwegian kroners [over US$ 600,000] 
was provided for education sector alone. It was said that they 
went to the jungles at the instigation of Kachin State organizer 
of the NLD U Tin Aung. However, only when they arrived there did 
they come to know that U Tin Aung had gone underground as he was 
in debt for 500,000 kyats in Mogaung. They also learnt that an 
annual fund of US$ 7,000 was provided by Sein Win's NCGUB to the 
NLD-North group and the travelling allowance of 100,000 bahts 
given for them to come from Pajao to Manerplaw were misused by U 
Tin Aung and that he had contacts with the former BCP [Burma 
Communist Party] group at the border with the other country. 
Thus, they at last distrusted in their leader U Tin Aung and 
they realized their mistake. 
  When they arrived at Manerplaw Camp they saw for themselves 
that those who had absconded after the disturbances in 1988 and 
went underground were disunited and were engaged in power 
struggle, killed each other, misappropriated funds, were self 
seekers, and earned income through illegal means and were of 
loose character. Moreover, Sein Win's `parallel government' was 
nothing but just a name-sake. They also learnt that soon the 
NCGUB would merge with the armed groups in the jungles to form 
the "Federal Government of Burma, FGB" and began to hate and 
abhor them and they became frustrated. 
  Having learnt the present situation that there is now peace 
and tranquillity in Kachin State and the KIO group is actively 
engaged, hand in hand with the government, in implementing 
regional development tasks, coming to have faith in the genuine 
goodwill and true attitude of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council and experiencing the unscrupulous acts and 
atrocities of the armed groups in the jungles, they began to 
realize their mistakes and repent and returned to the legal fold.

  [text]-TACHILEK (Myanmar), Wed. - Myanmar Government troops 
have seized hundreds of people from this border town to serve as 
porters in nearby hills where they are battling Golden Triangle 
opium warlord Khun Sa, residents said today. 
  The troops have swept through tea shops, restaurants and 
gambling dens, seizing able-bodied men to carry ammunition and 
other supplies to frontline positions. 
  The roundups have sent hundreds fleeing across the nearby 
border to Thailand to escape the draft, they said. 
  "More than 500 people have been rounded up and trucked to 
the 
battlefield over the past five days," one Myanmar trader said. 
  Traders and shopkeepers said people were living in a state 
of 
fear and a self-imposed curfew was in effect with businesses 
closing early and residents disappearing indoors to avoid the 
regular evening sweeps for porters. 
  Hundreds sought refuge on the Thai side of the border. 
  "Soldiers stormed my village a few days ago and arrested 
everyone they could find," said 48-year-old Nan Hinh, now hiding 
out in the Thai border town of Mae Sai. 
  Almost 200 Myanmar people took refuge in a Buddhist temple 
in 
Mae Sai on Monday but were told by Thai authorities to return to 
Myanmar the next day, the temple's abbot told Reuters. 
  An officer in Khun Sa's guerilla army told Reuters many of 
the seized people had been killed in recent heavy fighting. 
  "At least 17 porters were among 47 people killed on their 
side over the last five days at Doi Kong Mon," Khwan Muang, a 
regional commander in Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA) said. 
  Doi Kong Mon is about 20km west of Tachilek in the hills of 
Shan State. 
  Khwan Muang said 27 Myanmar troops and porters were killed 
fighting on Sunday and about 20 more died in a clash yesterday 
morning. 
  He said eight MTA soldiers were killed and 27 wounded in the 
battles. 
  The guerilla commander said he expected fighting to 
intensify 
and about 500 Myanmar government reinforcements had been moved 
into the area where the MTA had a similar strength. 
  Khun Sa declared independence for a Shan state in December 
and ordered his troops to begin an all-out offensive against 
Myanmar forces from the beginning of May, Kwan Muang said. 
  "We are convinced that now is the time to begin our war 
against Myanmar. We have the strength to fight them and the 
Shan people support us," he said. 
  He said the MTA had 20,000 troops and was better equipped 
than the government infantry. 
  Khwan Muang said MTA guerillas have launched offensives 
against government positions in 13 different parts of 
northeastern Myanmar's Shan state this month. 
  Khun Sa, alias Chang Sifu, the 60-year-old half-Chinese, 
half-Shan MTA commander, controls some of the richest 
opium-producing areas in the Golden Triangle, the area where 
Myanmar, Thailand and Laos meet. 
  He says he merely taxes opium traders to finance the 
struggle 
for the independence of Shan state from Yangon buy he was 
indicted by a US Federal court on heroin trafficking charges in 
1990.-- Reuter

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir has reminded the members of 
the United Malays National Organization, UMNO, and the people in 
general of the danger of money politics and corruption to the 
nation and the people. He said if money politics is accepted 
within the party, corruption becomes a culture in UMNO and party 
leaders are elected through bribery, the government will be led 
by criminals and the corrupt. 
  The prime minister, who is the president of UMNO, was 
opening 
the party's special assembly in Kuala Lumpur. He said people 
who regard corruption as part of the political and 
administrative tools, only serve their own greed. Their 
interest to become leaders is only for their own good and not 
for the benefit of the people and the country. When the 
government is corrupted, so are the government servants. This 
will result in the whole government machinery being corrupted. 
  The prime minister said untiring efforts are required to 
stamp out corruption before it becomes a part of the country's 
culture. It will be beyond control once it becomes a culture. 
The people will not get the protection of the law. They will 
be victimized as they have no place to air their grievances. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said in the party, a person who buys 
votes will not be ashamed to sell his dignity when he becomes a 
leader. His priority is not to struggle for the religion, the 
nation, and the people, but self-interest. Such a leader has no 
dignity and responsibility and is even willing to sell the 
country and people. 
  The prime minister also spoke of the ill-effects of 
corruption if it is not checked. He said a society which is 
influenced by corruption will not achieve progress. Costs will 
shoot up while all transactions will move at slow pace. It is 
the people who will suffer. 
  UMNO members face penalties ranging from a warning to 
expulsion if they are found guilty of abuse of power or 
involvement in money politics under the proposed amendment to 
the party constitution. UMNO deputy president Datuk Sri Anwar 
Ibrahim, who tabled the motion for the amendment outlined the 
actions that could be taken by the Supreme Council under a new 
clause. Measures that could be taken include warning, 
suspension of party privileges, disqualification from vying for 
party posts, or contesting in general and state elections for a 
term specified by the Supreme Council, and other punishments 
being fixed and in accordance with the constitution. The motion 
to amend the constitution involves the insertion of the new 
clause 18.6 and three other new clauses and amendments to two 
clauses aimed at combating abuse of power and money politics 
which it was feared would destroy the party if left unchecked.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 20 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Japanese 
investors must speed up the process of transferring technology 
or face the risk of losing their market share in Malaysia, 
Minister of Science, Technology and Environment, Law Hieng Ding, 
said Monday. 
  He said that if they did not transfer the technology, they 
would lose their market niche to European countries and the 
United States, not only in Malaysia but in the region too. 
  The Japanese, however, now realise the negative consequences 
of not transferring technology and are moving fast towards this 
goal, he told reporters after launching the Finger-Lock System 
of Polytron Resources Sdn Bhd [Private Limited] here. 
  The security system uses finger print instead of a key or a 
card to gain access into a building or home. 
  Law said the rapid development in the Asia-Pacific would 
entail Japan to change its policy in respect of technology 
transfer.

  [Text] The federal government will not issue work permits 
to British companies involving themselves in the Kelantan 
government under the water supply privatization project in the 
east coast state. Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa said 
this was because the ban on British companies is still in force 
and the state government's need to have dealings with British 
companies contradicts the federal government's policy. 
  Speaking to newsmen in Kota Baru, he said the state 
government's decision to have joint ventures with British 
companies did not violate any law since such dealings were 
within its jurisdiction. But the issuance of work permits came 
under the purview of the federal government. 
  Encik [Mr.] Annuar said that Kelantan's (?new) deal on the 
privatization project fatefully has raised doubts.

  [Text] Rembau, Sat. -- Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar 
[State Chief Minister] Tan Sri Mohamed Isa Abdul Samad has urged 
Al-Arqam followers to abandon the movement which has not only 
deviated from Islamic teachings but is also a threat to national 
security. 
  He said the state government viewed the movement's deviant 
activities seriously and would intensify efforts to explain to 
the people about the group. 
  "We do not want to see the racial harmony enjoyed by the 
people under the Barisan Nasional government threatened by the 
movement," he said in response to Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed's statement that the Al-Arqam movement had 
reached a level that may threaten national security. 
  Speaking after attending a district-level Maal Hijrah 
[Hegira 
Muslim new year] celebration here yesterday, he said the state 
government would support any Federal Government action to curb 
the movement's activities. 
  He said religious officers and mosque administrators in all 
districts would be asked to explain in detail to their 
congregation on where the movement went wrong. 
  "In this way we will be able to check the movement's 
deviationist activities from spreading," he said, adding that 
the state government had banned the movement last year.

  [Text] The Malaysian economy grew at a robust 8.6 percent 
in the first quarter of this year against 7.6 percent for the 
same period in 1993. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said the stronger growth was driven by 
firmer export growth and higher domestic demand, particularly 
investment. He said this in Kuala Lumpur last night. He also 
said that inflation remains stable at 4.3 percent during the 
first four months of the year, similar to the rate recorded in 
the same period of 1993. The government is confident that 
inflation will be kept at about four percent this year compared 
with a month-to-month basis. 
  He added that the consumer price index, which measures the 
rate of inflation, had in fact dropped marginally. Datuk Sri 
Anwar said the manufacturing sector, which expanded by 13.7 
percent, led the first quarter gross domestic product growth 
followed by the construction sector with a 12 percent expansion, 
services 9.6 percent, and agriculture 2.2 percent. 
  Speaking in Serdang today, Datuk Sri Anwar said the 
government has never neglected rural development and its record 
in striking a balance between the interest of the rural and 
urban community is the best in the region. He said the 
contention of the country's development programs were not 
comprehensive was mere empty talk which the opposition indulged 
in because they refused to acknowledge the government's 
achievements. He said the government's development (?democracy) 
was to develop the people in all aspects of life to ensure no 
one was left behind. 
  The deputy prime minister said not many countries have 
achieved a high rate of development and none can match 
Malaysia's record in rural development.

  [Excerpt] President Ong Teng Cheong said last night he has 
recovered fully from the loss of his voice and has resumed 
normal duties since Monday. 
  Speaking to reporters during the intermission of the Beijing 
People's Art Theatre performance at the Victoria Theatre, he 
said the loss of his voice last week was due to a virus 
infection. 
  He had been warded at the National University Hospital on 
June 8 for rest and observation after a routine medical 
check-up, which included an endoscopy of his stomach, colon, and 
rectum and was discharged last Saturday. 
  He said that he developed a sore throat after the endoscopy 
procedure during which a tube-like instrument was lowered into 
his body. 
  "I think I probably have some slight trauma to the throat 
after the procedure, but the loss of voice was due to a virus 
infection which occurred unfortunately at about the same time of 
the endoscopy," he said. 
  He described the infection as a "coincidence, a rare 
coincidence." 
  He said that since he was diagnosed as suffering fron 
low-grade lymphoma in l992 he has been going for regular 
check-ups. 
  He has blood tests every two to three months and other tests 
such as computed tomography scans and X-rays once or twice a 
year. 
  He added that when his lymphoma was first diagnosed, his 
doctors had not recommended treatment "but to wait and watch" 
for signs of progression of the disease. 
  So far, they had not recommended any treatment. 
  "I lead a normal life, I don't suffer from pain, so 
everything is normal," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen claimed King 
Norodom Sihanouk could not become prime minister without 
changing the constitution, which would require National Assembly 
approval. 
  In a personal letter to the king dated June 18, Hun Sen said 
he told the Cambodian Foreign Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut, 
who consulted him on June 13 on the conferring of power to the 
king, that Article 17 of the constitution -- which states that 
the king reigns but does not govern -- cannot be changed. 
  Hun Sen said amending the constitution was the mandate of 
the 
National Assembly. "I further told Samdech Khromkhun that it is 
not sure that the Assembly would support any change to the 
Constitution," he said in the letter obtained by THE NATION. 
  Hun Sen said he was forced by circumstances to clarify his 
position on the Khmer Rouge problem and on the conferring of 
executive power to the king. 
  In the letter, Hun Sen apologized if his wording might 
offend 
or inconvenience the king, who is undergoing medical treatment 
in Beijing. 
  Hun Sen complained that while he has done everything 
according to the constitution, he had still been blamed for 
being an obstacle to accommodating the Khmer Rouge, who are 
opposed to the Paris peace agreement, the present constitution 
and the elected government. 
  In the letter, Hun Sen demanded that the king clarify his 
plans for Cambodia in relation to an article in the June 23 
edition of the FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW. 
  Despite the king's persistent denial of rumours that he was 
about to return to power, Hun Sen said he was deeply shaken by 
an article entitled Cambodia: Last Act, especially the parts 
which suggested that he (Hun Sen) "is an obstacle to conferring 
power on the King". 
  "What I need right now is the truth about whether Your 
Majesty really wants to take power as Prime Minister as has been 
published in the media, so that I might assess according to the 
real facts," the letter said. 
  The FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW said Sihanouk had acknowledged 
that his bid for power would be doomed without the acquiescence 
of Hun Sen and the CPP [Cambodian People's Party] because he 
(the King) does "not want to shed blood to fight a secession led 
by Hun Sen. [no end quotes as published] 
  The article quotes the King as saying: "I cannot return to 
power to go back to Cambodia unless I have the assurance that 
Hun Sen and his party will join me in my government." 
  In his letter to the king, Hun Sen said: "This paragraph is 
very serious vis-a-vis myself because it implies that a war 
might break out not by the Khmer Rouge but by my humble person." 
  He said he was prepared to resign and allow the Khmer Rouge 
nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, to replace him if "permitted by 
the Constitution, supported by parliament and necessitated by 
national interest." 
  "There is no need to fear that I might wage a secessionist 
war," he continued. 
  In the six-page letter, Hun Sen also said he could not 
accept 
the Khmer Rouge political programme which he described as "a 
coup" against the constitution. 
  The Khmer Rouge has demanded the dissolution of the National 
Assembly and the elected government, and the formation of a new 
government with Khmer Rouge participation; and the withdrawal of 
government troops from the frontline in return for a ceasefire 
agreement and other military concessions. 
  Hun Sen said it was up to the National Assembly to debate 
the 
demands of the Maoist group, but as an MP he would certainly 
vote against them.

  [Text] The following is the gist of a letter sent by the 
representatives of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] in 
Phnom Penh to Phnom Penh residents informing them about the 
closure of the PDK office in Phnom Penh by the two-headed 
government's Ministry of the Interior: 
  1. We, representatives of the PDK in Phnom Penh, would like 
to inform the brothers in all circles in Phnom Penh that on 16 
June 1994, at 1830, the two-headed government's Ministry of the 
Interior handed us a letter setting a deadline for all of us to 
leave Phnom Penh no later than 19 June. 
  2. We have been staying at the PDK office in Phnom Penh in 
conformity with the Paris agreement and later, at the august 
decision of His Majesty the king, who has graciously given us 
permission to occupy this crown property so that we can maintain 
sustained, uninterrupted contact with the aim of gradually 
fostering mutual understanding pending the procecss of national 
reconciliation. However, the two-headed government's Ministry 
of the Interior has just set a deadline for us to leave Phnom 
Penh before 19 June. We therefore feel compelled to leave Phnom 
Penh. 
  3. We would like to thank the people in all circles for 
giving us all kinds of support and assistance throughout our 
stay in Phnom Penh. 
  4. We want to live with all of you in Phnom Penh forever 
within the framework of national reconciliation and national 
concord and within the framework of genuine peeace. 
  5. However, we are compelled to take temporary leave of you 
and we hope that one day we will be able to return and see you 
again. 
  6. We pray that there will be national reconciliation and 
national corcord in the near future so that peace returns and 
Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 
are restored.

  [Text] After learning that the two-headed government's 
Ministry of the Interior had set a deadline for the 
representatives of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] to 
vacate their office in Phnom Penh, King Norodom Sihanouk was 
very worried. He expressed his worries in two messages. 
  In the first message dated 18 June and addressed to His 
Excellency Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK, the king said 
there was a threat to Democratic Kampuchea in Phnom Penh. For 
this reason, he believed it was preferable for the PDK to 
withdraw its representatives from the capital, because he feared 
that accidents might happen to PDK representatives. If 
accidents did happen to PDK representatives, he said, there 
would surely be a serious problem. 
  In the same message, King Norodom Sihanouk added that he 
would continue to have good relations with the PDK. 
  In another message King Norodom Sihanouk demanded that the 
two-headed government avoid doing anything harmful to PDK 
representatives and that it give the latter sufficient time to 
prepare for their departure. 
  Observers have noted that the king was worried because he 
understood that should the two-headed government harm PDK 
representatives in Phnom Penh there would be serious 
consequences both at home and abroad. 
  At home, there would be a collapse of and an apathy in the 
process of national reconciliation and the entire nation and 
people would never forgive the traitors -- the communist 
Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed elements -- for that. As 
a result, there would be a traumatic situation in which the king 
himself would no longer be able to play any mediating role in 
the settlement of the problem. This was the main cause of the 
king's worries. 
  Moreover, observers have agreed that the PDK office in Phnom 
Penh was closed because the communist Vietnamese, their puppets, 
and the two-headed government were afraid of the Cambodian 
masses and they were trying to exercise the powers of their 
fascist, dictatorial regime. However, the more fascist they 
become, the sooner their suicide.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Austerity Program for Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the 
world with an average annual income of only $250. Because of 
this appalling poverty, the royal government cannot escape 
criticism that it has been squandering the national budget on 
certain superfluous enterprises that do not benefit either 
national reconstruction or national defense, but is spent on 
extravagant entertainment. 
  His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia recently expressed a strong opinion about this. In a 
message to the heads of the royal government earlier this week, 
the king appealed for an austerity program to be observed by 
Cambodia. It can be understood easily that the austerity program 
urged by the king is a program of thrift and frugality in the 
face of the reckless, unnecessary spending currently seen by 
impoverished Cambodia. 
  Of course, some would say that "thrift and frugality" are 
preached especially by communists. The truth, however, is that 
thrift and frugality in general belong to the most elementary 
economic concept that everybody, whether he is red, blue, or 
pink, must espouse. 
  Through his initiative, the king of Cambodia has forced the 
royal government to realize that Cambodia, which is strapped 
with serious budget constraints, must cut spending on costly 
decorations and entertainment from all public ceremonies, a step 
seen as part of the "austerity" program. The king pointed out 
that the royal government should stop such activities as 
fireworks displays, conducting parades and processions, and 
holding beauty contests. These events were especially brazen 
during the celebration of the latest Cambodian traditional new 
year. While suggesting that there should not be parades, 
processions, floats, and fireworks during independence day 
celebrations, the king proposed that a traditional dance show 
and just one or two musical bands would suffice for public 
entertainment. Besides, the king also suggested that the number 
of delegations abroad and the length of their stay in each 
foreign country should also be limited to the minimum. 
  It is true that "the people will surely be pleased with this 
kind of austerity program." However, the royal government must 
not consider only the belt-tightening measures initiated by the 
king. It must work out its own austerity policy. In the current 
situation in which poverty is widespread, the royal government 
must never allow its ministers to remain extravagant. Or does 
it wish to preserve a tradition of extreme lavishness with each 
minister being accorded a monthly telephone bill of over 
$10,000; electricity consumption of 30,000 to 40,000 
kilowatt-hours; and two, three, or even four official cars at 
his disposal?

  [Text] On 14 June, the people and the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] cooperated in attacking and 
completely dispersing the military and civilian state authority 
of the puppets of communist Vietnam in Trapeang Kraloeng, Phnum 
Sruch district seat, Kompong Speu Province. 
  After a battle lasting an hour, we fully controlled this 
district township. Fifteen of the invading troops of the 
puppets of communist Vietnam were killed and eight others 
wounded. Ten army shelters and three district office buildings 
were destroyed. We seized eight AK rifles, three AR-15's, and 
three (BH) mines. 
  At the same time, 20 soldiers of the puppets of communist 
Vietnam and 11 officials serving the communist Vietnam's puppets 
surrendered and joined the people and the NADK. They said that 
they will stop serving the communist Vietnamese, who are 
continuing to attack and kill the nation. These compatriots 
asked to join forces with the people and the NADK to fight the 
military and civilian state authorities of the puppets of 
communist Vietnam to quickly destroy them so that there will be 
peace, without anyone forcing the compatriots to fight. 
  However, the people and the NADK suggested that these 
compatriots return home and join forces with the people in their 
localities to fight the warmongers in their dens. This way 
there will be no one to force the compatriots to fight and die, 
leaving their families behind, and there will be no one to force 
compatriots to round up the people's relatives to serve as 
soldiers --- an act which makes the people angry and causes them 
to loath and hurl insults at these compatriots.

<F P=106> ["Press communique of the Royal Government spokesman"; dated </F>
20 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] A plenary session of the cabinet was held at 1500 
on the afternoon of 18 June under the chairmanship of Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, first and 
second prime ministers of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC] to 
examine the immigration bill. After a thorough debate, the 
cabinet approved this investment bill which has eight chapters 
and 26 articles. 
  The cabinet commended the experts for skillfully drafting 
the 
bill which has contents suitable for the urgent requirements of 
the nation and domestic and foreign investment. 
  The cabinet paid attention to discussing and improving the 
draft to attract investments to the KoC, thus creating and 
increasing jobs for the people and enhancing the production in 
the following domains: 
  I. Concerning Chapter II dealing with the Cambodian 
Development Council [CDC], the cabinet unanimously regarded the 
CDC as the general staff of the Royal Government of Cambodia 
[RGC] in investment work and the competent body which has sole 
access to the issuance of investment permits. At the same time, 
the cabinet agreed on the protection of investors' rights and 
freedoms. The arrangement, function, and composition of the CDC 
will be set by a sub-decree. 
  II. Concerning Chapter III dealing with the investment 
guarantees, the RGC recognizes all investors equally, that is, 
there will be no discrimination based on their nationality and 
race. The RGC guarantees that it will not nationalize the 
assets of the investors, ensures that it will not [words 
indistinct]. 
  III. Concerning Chapter IV dealing with the incentives for 
investment, the priority domains to be encouraged are as follows: 
  1. Modern or high-technology industries. 
  2. Labor-intensive investment projects (?including) tourism, 
industry, and agriculture. 
  3. Projects to enhance the export or production of 
import-substitutes, agro-industrial projects, and [words 
indistinct]. 
  4. Projects to develop the provinces and the countryside, 
infrastructure [words indistinct] located in special development 
zones. 
  Tax and profit incentives are as follows: 
  A nine-prcent tax on income; the exemption of tax on profits 
up to eight years depending on the characteristics of each 
investment project, whose order of priority will be determined 
by the RGC in a sub-decree; tax exemption on all reinvested 
profits; 100-percent tax exemption on goods that are exported; 
100-percent tax exemption on the import of goods to serve 
investments (?and) projects producing 80 percent of their goods 
for export [words indistinct] tourism industry, labor-intensive 
industries [words indistinct]; and permits for the import of 
foreign supervisors, specialists, technicians, and specialized 
workers, and their partners in line with the KoC's immigration 
law. 
  IV. Concerning Chapter V dealing with the ownership and use 
of land. In keeping with the Constitution, the problem of land 
ownership [words indistinct]. This means that the Cambodian 
partner must own over 50 percent of the total investment. 
  Foreign individuals or partners are allowed to use land 
through a long-term lease of up to 70 years. The use of land 
[words indistinct]. 
  V. Also on that occasion, the cabinet agreed that any 
individual dispute shall be reconciled first by the CDC before 
being forwarded to court. Also, any dispute with the 
authorities concerned will be sent to (?the Cambodian Investment 
Board). 
  The implementation of this investment law [words 
indistinct]. 
However, this law will not affect investors who have been 
operating before this law comes into effect. 
  The cabinet ended its session at (?2000) in an atmosphere of 
unity and with high sense of responsibility.

  [Summary] Peasants have so far reclaimed more than 300,000 
hectares of land to grow floating rice. Peasants rely totally 
on tractors to till these areas, which are located mostly in the 
provinces around Tonle Sap Lake. 
  According to Mr. Liang Sam-hat, head of the agricultural 
machine tool directorate, "by mid-June, only 85,000 hectares, or 
35 percent of the plan, had been tilled. It is expected that by 
the end of the season, that is, at the end of June, only about 
50 percent of the total acreage will be tilled. This is a cause 
of great concern for it might lead shortages in the food supply 
for next year." 
  Due to insecurity, tractors could not carry out their 
operations. "In some provinces where there are vast areas for 
planting floating rice, such as Banteay Meanchey, the Khmer 
Rouge have forced the tractor owners and landlords to pay them 
taxes. This is why the tractor-operators in this province could 
till only 45 percent of the planned 70,000 hectares. In 
Battambang Province, only over 20,000 out of the planned 55,000 
hectares were tilled so far. Kompong Thom Province could till 
only 4,000 out of the 24,000 hectares." 
  Presently over 2,000 imported tractors, of which 90 percent 
belong to the private sector while the remaining 10 percent were 
imported through various international organizations, are 
distributed to various state agricultural services. The farmers 
like to use the much cheaper tractors made in the Soviet Union 
and China, which are as good as those made in Great Britain and 
the United States. 
  At the recent National Assembly meeting, Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh said that the Royal Government plans to build 
a tractor factory with loans from foreign countries. Tractors 
to be produced by this factory will be sold to farmers at the 
cheapest price with an aim to promote rice production, 
particularly in the floating-rice zone.

  [Text] President and Madame Tien Suharto tonight hosted a 
state banquet for visiting Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince 
Ranariddh and his wife, and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen at the 
State Palace in Jakarta. 
  In their speeches, President Suharto and Prince Ranariddh 
stressed the need to make efforts to solve Cambodia's internal 
problems. 
  President Suharto said that it is the Cambodian people 
themselves who will determine their own fate and future. He 
said that Indonesia will continue to help rebuild Cambodia, 
adding that close cooperation among developing countries will 
lessen our dependence on industrialized countries. 
  Meanwhile, in his reply speech, Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
expressed the hope that Indonesia will continue to provide 
Cambodia with assistance to solve its internal problems, 
including wiping out the Khmer Rouge insurgent group. 
  Prior to the state banquet, President Suharto presented 
souvenirs to his two guests of honor. He gave them a Bali Kris 
[dagger] decorated with a silver handle, silk batik shirt, and 
books on Indonesia. Norodom Ranariddh presented to President 
Suharto a silver dinner set and silk material. Meanwhile, 
Madame Tien Suharto presented a silver dinner set, a model of 
the Indonesia miniature park, and batik silk material to her 
guests. 
  The state banquet will be followed by a performance of 
several Indonesian traditional dances. 
  This afternoon, the Cambodian guests paid a courtesy call on 
Vice President and Madame Try Sutrisno at the South Merdeka 
Palace, in Jakarta. On the occasion, they also exchanged gifts.

  [Text] Murdiono, minister/state secretary, briefed 
reporters on the outcome of talks between President Suharto and 
Cambodian co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun 
Sen at the Merdeka [Presidential] Palace in Jakarta today. 
  He said that the Government of Cambodia has expressed its 
wish for the essential goods from Indonesia to be dispatched 
directly to Phnom Penh instead of going through a third country. 
In the past, Indonesian goods exported to Cambodia were 
delivered through a third country. The leaders had also reached 
an agreement on the banking and trade procedures to be observed 
by the two countries. 
  Murdiono said that Indonesia is still in great demand for 
the 
supply of soybeans to fulfill its domestic needs. For this, 
President Suharto suggested that if Cambodia could produce the 
commodity, bilateral trade between the two countries could be 
stepped up. 
  Meanwhile, speaking at a news conference at Wisma Negara 
[State Guest House] today, Prince Norodom Ranariddh said that 
Cambodia will not seek military assistance from Indonesia but 
wants to learn more about Indonesian military's experience in 
handling the communist and separatist movements. 
  According to Hun Sen, the only problem that Cambodia faces 
now is its internal politics, because the Khmer Rouge group 
still wants to remain isolated.

  [Text] The stalled national reconciliation process in 
Cambodia, which has not borne fruit so far, delayed the 
Indonesian visit of Cambodian leaders Norodom Ranariddh and Hun 
Sen. The two leaders were only able to begin their visit to 
Indonesia yesterday. After they had assumed the post of first 
and second prime minister following last year's elections, they 
only managed to visit the PRC and Thailand. 
  Even as they left Phnom Penh for Jakarta, the spark that 
could trigger another outbreak of war was ignited after the 
Khmer Rouge rejected an offer for cease-fire scheduled for the 
end of this month. 
  As such, the elected Cambodian Government has not managed to 
carry out economic reconstruction in the country ravaged by the 
15-year-old civil war. Cambodia's economic reconstruction needs 
the support of friendly countries, including Indonesia. 
  The visit to Indonesia by the two Cambodian prime ministers 
accompanied by seven key ministers, is aimed at obtaining 
Indonesia's commitment for economic and technical assistance. 
Indonesia, which played a major role in the birth of the new 
Republic of Cambodia [title of country as heard] and currently 
serves as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, will pay special 
attention to the challenges faced by the Cambodian Government 
and people. Efforts to improve Cambodia's economy and 
stability, which will in turn contribute to the stability of 
Southeast Asia, have indeed become Indonesia's basic commitment 
to that country. We are aware that any problem that arises in 
any country will have a negative impact on other countries in 
the same region. 
  Friendly relations between Indonesia and Cambodia in fact 
have long cultural and historical roots. As a nation that once 
suffered under long colonial rule, we fully understand the need 
to extend assistance to Cambodia in its efforts to consolidate 
national stability through continued economic development and 
the improvement of the people's economic welfare. 
  Based on the historical friendship between the two nations, 
we believe there are many forms of long-term and short-term 
cooperation that can be developed. Such cooperation will be 
discussed between President Suharto and his two Cambodian guests 
at Jakarta's Merdeka Palace today. We hope the success of 
Cambodia's economic reconstruction will lead to its stability 
and national reconciliation. Our experience has shown that 
without national reconciliation and unity, it is impossible to 
carry out economic development smoothly.

  [Excerpt] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- The Government Regulation 
No:20 of 1994 was not aimed at selling Indonesia. The new 
deregulation package was issued because the government 
considered that the domestic investors would be unable to absorb 
all the domestic investments. Apart from this, there is an 
urgent need to boost the country's nongas exports, which could 
be accelerated through more investments. 
  This was stated by Saleh Affif, Coordinating Minister for 
Economics, Finance and Industry, and Development Supervision to 
newsmen at the Finance Ministry in Jakarta on Monday 6 June. 
Answering more questions on the deregulation, which was 
considered to provide too many opportunities to foreign 
investors, the minister said, "We do not intend to sell 
Indonesia. We have never done so." 
  According to Saleh Affif, the government had taken into 
consideration the domestic investors' inability to meet the huge 
demand for local investments. He said, "We also have a big 
workforce which should be absorbed into the various economic 
activities. This has all along been the focus of our attention." 
  Indonesia's direct foreign investments (FDI in English 
provided in parenthesis) is relatively small compared with other 
those of countries. Indonesia's total investments and the FDI 
are, comparatively, well below those of Singapore's. 
  Apart from this, Saleh Affif said Indonesia truly desires to 
boost its nongas exports, which could be done through more 
investments. 
  He said the government will launch a series of deregulations 
after the launch of the Government Regulation No:20/1994. 
Speaking after a meeting with other ministers, he said, "I 
attended a meeting with other ministers just now to discuss 
issues which we should embark upon during the next issuance of 
deregulation packages." 
  He said, "You will have to wait. The government will 
announce more deregulation packages soon with regard to the 
reduction of import tariffs and the deregulation of the List of 
Negative Investments, DNI." In other words, more economic 
sectors will be handed over to foreign investors. 
  Seizing the opportunity, Saleh Affif added that with the 
launch of the new deregulation package, Indonesia has advanced a 
step forward from its other leading competitors toward 
attracting more foreign investments. 
  The newsmen also asked Saleh Affif several questions in 
connection with the stability of the recently launched 
deregulation package. This was because Information Minister 
Harmoko disagreed with the notion of permitting foreign 
investors to enter the mass media sector. Besides, the 
Communications Department stated that it was not called to 
participate in the debate on the issues of Government Regulation 
No:20/1994. 
  The newsmen asked," Was there any coordination prior to the 
discussion on the deregulation which created the ongoing 
skepticism?". 
  Saleh Affif only smiled and said, "In fact, there was 
coordination." 
  He clarified that public views on opening the mass media to 
foreign investors were discussed during his meeting with a 
number of ministers. He said,"To avoid any misunderstanding, we 
have submitted the issue to Minister-State Secretary Murdiono 
for his decision." 
  Meanwhile, speaking after the opening of a training course 
on 
the utilization of resources for medium- and small-scale 
entrepreneurs in Ceper, central Java, Subiakto Tchakrawerdaya, 
Minister for Cooperatives and Development of Small Enterprises 
said the government will not allow the small enterprises to 
evaporate even though no limit on investments was imposed for 
foreign investors. This means that the government will plan 
several effective strategies to secure the position of the small 
enterprises. 
  Such strategies would be to find the best methods to create 
more sub-contracting activities for the small industries. 
Another method would be for the government to extend credit 
facilities with low interest rates and to provide market access 
and so on. 
  Subiakto said, "Please believe that the government has no 
intention whatsoever of doing away with the cooperatives and 
small enterprises by allowing foreign investors to participate 
in the various sectors. In fact, the government hoped that by 
announcing the Government Regulation No:20/1994, it would be 
able to assist the small enterprises to benefit through business 
opportunities." 
  Such a step could be undertaken by cooperatives and small 
enterprises through joint ventures with foreign investors in the 
public or other sectors. The small enterprises and cooperatives 
could then provide the manpower and raw materials while the 
foreign investors could could assist in extending their 
technological expertise, finance, and market access. [Passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Government Regulation No:20/1994 Needs In-Depth </F>
Debates on Implications and Objectives"] 
  [Text] Article 5 of Government Regulation No:20/1994 on the 
ownership of shares by foreign investors states as follows: 
  "Industries, which are set up in accordance with Article 2 
of 
Sentence 1A, are allowed to conduct businesses in important 
national and public industries such as ports, production and 
transmission of electricity supply to the public, 
telecommunications, maritime services, rail services, atomic 
energy generating plants, and the mass media." 
  The focus of attention that caused public concern was the 
issue on foreign investors being given permission to invest in 
the mass media. The press, parliamentarians and even certain 
members of the government, were observed to have reacted 
strongly to the issue without making any prior effort to 
understand the actual situation. 
  The situation became indisputable only after the president 
clarified the issue to Information Minister Harmoko. The 
implementation of Government Regulation No:20/1994 still needs 
the president's final approval. The president will refer to and 
apply the relevant existing laws and regulations before giving 
his final approval. 
  Regarding the press, there is Regulation No:21 of 1982. The 
regulations forbid foreign investors to own press media. 
Therefore, in implementing Government Regulation No:20/1994, 
particularly for the mass media, the president will definitely 
invoke Regulation No:21. In other words, foreign investors 
cannot own the mass media. 
  As such, it was a relief to acknowledge that the anxiety on 
the issue related to the mass media had somewhat subsided. 
  What about the implications of Government Regulation 
No:20/1994 regarding laws governing the electronic mass media 
such as television -- the regulations that have yet to be set 
up? For the moment, there was no reaction to this issue. It may 
emerge sooner or later. This is because the electronic mass 
media's implications are parallel to those of the print media. 
It should be reminded that the television sector is more open 
and susceptible to control by foreign investors compared with 
the print media. 
  Meanwhile, it was observed that the decisions, which were 
included in Government Regulation No:20/1994 on the mass media, 
were not strongly directed toward the electronic mass media. 
  Such things happen everywhere. The electronic mass media, 
such as the television, needs huge funds and the most modern 
technology. The acquisition of programs is more of a 
transnational nature. As acknowledged, the United States 
dominates the entertainment and news programs. 
  If it were true that the foreign investors' presence in the 
mass media would enhance their footing in the electronic mass 
media, then they could similarly do so in the print media. This 
should be food for thought. 
  Furthermore, we are currently facing changes to 
globalization 
and the information era. Strong influences are not within our 
reach nor under our control. 
  It was also acknowledged that competition also exists in 
other countries between the electronic mass media and the print 
media, particularly the television sector. 
  In this regard, the public sector was seen to reflect a 
positive attitude toward Government Regulation No:20/1994. 
  Government Regulation No:20/1994 should be accepted by the 
public with an open and positive attitude. The public needs to 
be involved in discussions, particularly in issues pertaining to 
the implementation and supervision of mutual interests. If a 
serious concern prevails on the part of the public regarding 
such matters, then important and pertinent issues should not be 
brushed aside. 
  The public's principal concern was that there was no 
coordination during the preparation of Government Regulation 
No:20/1994, which was later presented to the public. This was 
observed when more than one minister stated that they were not 
invited to participate in the consultations. Therefore, the 
coordinating minister should provide explainations should there 
be queries. 
  It was possible that such an issue was overlooked. Such a 
move was not beneficial. Thus, the president's aides were 
considered responsible for the weakness or lack of coordination. 
  There were numerous public opinions in this regard. There 
were those of the opinion that the lack of coordination was not 
a new issue while others created a humorous acronym, KISS, which 
when expanded means that each official is living in his own 
castle. Then there are persons who considered that coordination 
had never been smooth, and the current situation remains 
unchanged. It was considered that coordination is deteroriating. 
  The various opinions and evaluations were considered to be 
constructive. One thing is clear. We need to have a smoother 
and more effective coordination no matter how we may view the 
current situation of coordination. The government, and 
particularly the presidential aides, needs to coordinate this 
issue more effectively. 
  Coordination is much needed because the challenges and 
issues 
we are facing are becoming more complex and difficult, and they 
exist within a dynamic and intensifying condition -- in the 
socioeconomic, sociopolitical and other sectors that lie within 
the flow of dynamic reforms. Therefore, the present need for 
coordination is much greater than before. 
  The objective, purpose, and implication of Government 
Regulation No:20/1994 are ethical, far-reaching, and strategic 
in ensuring the continuation of development. Its aim and 
background is clear, that is, to turn Indonesia into a more 
competitive nation that can attract more foreign investors. 
  Let there be an open public discussion on the issue of the 
far-reaching implications and the possibility of finding some 
alternative ways to attract foreign investments. A truly 
wholesome discussion is hoped for in the effort toward procuring 
optimum benefit from Government Regulation No:20/1994 and in 
sharing the prosperity with the public. At the least losses 
within the public interests could be reduced.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Concern Over Deregulation"] </F>
  [Text] The great concern, despite the resounding positive 
reactions, aroused by the May 19 deregulation of foreign 
investment is quite understandable. The move opens wide areas 
of public utilities such as sea and air transportation, 
seaports, drinking water, railways and power generation and 
distribution to direct foreign investment. The hiccup was made 
even stronger because the mass media industry itself was opened 
to foreign majority ownership in violation of the Press Law of 
1982. 
  Several analysts, including noted economist Kwik Kian Gie, 
have argued strongly that opening public utilities and services 
to foreign investors is contrary to Article 6 of the Foreign 
Investment Law of 1967. We think however, the article still 
allows foreign investment in those public utilities, not in the 
form of wholly-owned ventures, but through joint ventures with 
domestic interests. The article completely bans foreign 
investment only from the production of weapons, ammunition, 
explosive materials and other war machinery. 
  Nonetheless, the reactions and concern we have heard so far 
were, by and large, not so much against foreign investors' 
involvement in the sector of public utilities, but rather 
questions as to how the government would control and manage the 
public utilities owned by foreign businessmen. 
  The questions, to a certain extent, are legitimate. Similar 
to upstream industries which strongly influence the performance 
of downstream plants, pubic utilities have a far-reaching impact 
on both the business sector and the general public. It is 
perhaps also quite difficult for the general public to imagine, 
for example, that seaports can now be owned and operated by 
foreign entities. 
  Despite these legitimate concerns, we nevertheless think it 
is too early to presume that the latest policy measure is 
detrimental to the public interest. In fact, judging from our 
experiences with the control or monopoly wielded by our own 
private sector over some industries, we cannot say that it would 
have been better to only open those public utilities to domestic 
private investors. 
  On the other hand, foreign ownership or management is not 
automatically inimical to the public interest as the case of our 
customs inspection of imports has shown. The transfer of the 
customs inspection authority from our Customs and Excise Tax 
Directorate General to the Swiss Societe Generalede Surveillance 
(SGS) in 1985 has fully achieved its objective and satisfied 
both the government and businessmen. The government has been 
satisfied because under-invoicing and over-invoicing practices 
have been minimized. Businessmen have been pleased with the 
much smoother flow of imports and the much lower import costs. 
So great has been the SGS performance that businessmen are now 
worried because SGS is being phased out of Indonesia's customs 
inspection. 
  We think the government is capable of preventing or 
minimizing any potential damage of the foreign investment 
liberalization. As we noted in this column over the weekend, 
Government Regulation No.20/1994 regarding the foreign 
investment liberalization has yet to be translated into 
technical directives or guidelines through ministerial decrees. 
The technical directives can be designed to safeguard our 
national interest and to ensure that the measure will attract 
more foreign capital and channel the foreign investment to 
improve economic efficiency, job creation, transfer of 
technology and skills as well as export promotion. 
  We therefore ask the government not to overreact to the 
concern over the foreign investment liberalization. Doing so 
might prompt the government to make the technical directives so 
complex and arduous as to nullify most stipulations of the 
regulation itself. It is most important to make the directives 
clear-cut and the process of licensing foreign investment in 
public utilities fully transparent to prevent the impression 
that the deregulation was designed mostly to benefit particular 
domestic private companies with strong political connections.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Breakthrough in the Investment Field"] </F>
  [Text] The government's decision to issue a deregulation 
package to open new areas to foreign investment is a new 
breakthrough in the field of investment. The deregulation 
measure also opens many business activities that supplement the 
basic needs of the people in their daily life. As a matter of 
fact, the government has taken a very daring move to issue the 
new investment deregulation measure. The new deregulation 
package on investment was announced to newsmen by Murdiono, 
minister/state secretary, at his office in Jakarta on Thursday, 
2 June. Murdiono was accompanied by ministers in charge of the 
measure. Now that the deregulation package has been issued, it 
looks like the government is determined to make the country more 
attractive to foreign investors to face the keener and stiff 
competition in the international capital market. 
  The latest deregulation measure is contained in Government 
Regulation No. 20/1994 on shareholding in companies and it was 
approved by President Suharto on 19 May. 
  Under Government Regulation No. 20/1994, foreign investment 
can be set up in two forms -- wholly-owned foreign enterprises 
and joint ventures. The foreign investor is allowed to hold up 
to 95 percent share of the joint venture, and a 100-percent 
share of the wholly- owned investment. According to the 
previous regulation, foreign investors were required to 
gradually reduce their shareholdings to 51 percent after the 
20th year of business. This means the foreign investor was 
forced to become a minor share holder of the business. 
  It is interesting to carefully note that under the new 
deregulation package, foreign capital in joint venture projects 
can now enter into business activities that are considered 
strategic to the nation and which cater to the needs of many 
people. The new regulation opens seaports, telecommunications, 
power, civil aviation, sea transportation, production of potable 
water, railway, nuclear power, and mass media to foreign 
investors. It looks as if the government made a breakthrough in 
the capital investment to revitalize foreign investment, to 
overcome limited infrastructure facilities, to create a lot of 
job opportunities, and to boost the exports of nonoil and nongas 
commodities. 
  While the public sector is now opened to foreign capital, we 
have to further scrutinize the legal aspects and the 
implications of the deregulation package. Section 33 of the 
1945 Constitution stipulates that various kinds of production 
activities that are strategic to the nation and those that cater 
to the needs of many people, should be controlled by the state. 
  However, according to Sanyoto Satrowardoyo, minister for 
investment development, the Government Regulation does not 
contradict the 1967 Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment. Meanwhile, 
Murdiono, minister/state secretary, said that the latest 
deregulation package on foreign capital investment clearly 
defines the 1967 Law No. 1. On the other hand, we should 
realize that there must be objective, effective, and timely 
adjustments to suit the rapidly developing situation. 
  Five years ago, developing countries like PRC, Vietnam, 
Bangladesh, and India were considered to be closed to foreign 
capital investment. Nowadays, we are facing keener competition 
from these countries in attracting foreign investment in 
response to the process of globalization. 
  Another main reason for the announcement of the deregulation 
on foreign investment is to enable the economy to grow above 6 
percent, which has been fixed as the precondition to overcome 
unemployment. This is because population growth in Indonesia is 
still relatively high. Indonesia needs at least 660 trillion 
rupiah in new investment during the current sixth five-year 
development plan and 73 percent of the total is expected from 
private investment, including foreign capital. 
  Still, despite the seemingly attractive incentives offered 
by 
the new regulation, will the foreign investors be attracted to 
invest in Indonesia and can the foreign capital increase the 
limited funds owned by the local private sector? There are 
other factors that determine the investment climate in the 
country. They are, among others, economic and political 
stability and the risks from growing corrupt practices and 
collusion. Accordingly, we should exercise caution against such 
country risks [preceding two words in English] to attract 
foreign capital. 
  Besides, the foreign capital that is invested in vital 
public 
sectors should be fully controlled, supervised, and managed by 
the state. Otherwise, the risks are very high.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Total foreign investment 
commitments, which declined more than 80 percent in the 
March-April period to US$411.65 million, grew by more than four 
times to $1.78 billion in the 16 April-May 15 period. The 
Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) said in its latest monthly 
report yesterday that domestic approved investment commitments 
in the April-May period also increased to Rp [rupiah] 4.85 
trillion ($2.25 billion) from Rp 3.08 trillion ($1.43 billion) 
in the previous monthly period. 
  The report explained that foreign investments approved by 
the 
government during the April-May period were committed for 37 new 
projects worth $697.51 million and for 26 expansion projects 
worth $1.12 billion. In comparison, during the March-April 
period, the government approved 30 new projects worth $300.25 
million and 14 expansion projects worth $111.40 million. 
  Yesterday's report also noted that the domestic investment 
commitments approved in the April-May period comprised 84 new 
projects valued at Rp 3.49 trillion and 43 expansion projects 
valued at Rp 1.35 trillion. In the previous period, the 
government approved 44 new projects worth Rp 2.27 trillion and 
13 expansion projects worth Rp 809.36 billion.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Problem loans at all banks in the 
country declined from Rp [rupiah] 20 trillion (US$9.2 billion) 
last November to Rp 18.8 trillion ($8.7 billion), 10.2 percent 
of the total credits outstanding as of March, Governor of Bank 
Indonesia [Central Bank] Sudrajad Jiwandono says. 
  "Of the problem loans, some Rp 12.2 trillion were classified 
as doubtful credits and Rp 6.6 trillion as bad loans," Sudrajad 
said. 
  He said compared to the situation last November, the 
doubtful 
loans as of March reflected a 13.1 percent decrease but the bad 
credits posted a Rp 1 trillion or 6.5 percent increase. 
  The Central Bank chief told the House members that state 
banks accounted for Rp 8.6 trillion of the doubtful loans and Rp 
4.4 trillion of the bad credits. 
  "The doubtful loans at the state banks represented 8.9 
percent of their total lending and the bad credits 4.6 percent," 
he noted. 
  He noted that the total banking credits outstanding as of 
March were Rp 183.6 trillion, of which Rp 95.2 trillion belonged 
to the seven state banks and some Rp 88.4 trillion to private 
banks. 
  Private national banks, however, recorded a better 
performance because their doubtful loans amounted only to Rp 2.9 
trillion or 4.9 percent of their total lending and their bad 
credits Rp 1.5 trillion or 0.8 percent of their total credits. 
  According to Sudrajad, foreign and joint-venture banks 
incurred only Rp 300 billion in doubtful loans and bad credits, 
which together represented 1.9 percent of their total lending. 
  "Bank Indonesia in cooperation with the World Bank is now 
studying the possibility of setting up a special institution to 
take over the problem loans," he added. 
  Sudrajad said investigations made jointly by a special team 
of Bank Indonesia and experts from the World Bank since 1992 
concluded that the major cause of problem loans was poor 
management and inadequate credit assessment. 
  "The inadequate credit assessment seems to have been caused 
by the fierce competition since 1990 that forced many banks to 
resort to "go go lending" to maintain market shares," the 
governor pointed out. 
  He said the central bank had discussed the findings of the 
team with the directors of the banks concerned and firm measures 
had been taken to cope with the problem loans and to prevent 
recurrence of non-performing assets. 
  The findings of the team also prompted the Central Bank to 
order state banks to closely monitor the performance of their 50 
largest borrowers. 
  "We have also instructed state banks to strengthen their 
boards of commissioners (supervisors) with experts, Sudrajad 
added. 
  According to the governor many banks seemed to fail to 
require high professional standards from their commissioners 
(supervisors). 
  "Therefore, we have tightened the requirements for bank 
commissioners and have instructed the board of commissioners of 
every bank to submit a twice yearly report on their supervision 
activities," he said. 
  Bank internal auditors also have been ordered to send the 
findings of their audits to the board of commissioners, Sudrajad 
added. 
  The Central Bank, he said, is also improving procedures for 
prohibiting bad debtors from becoming shareholders or executives 
of banks. 
  "Bank Indonesia has ordered banks to submit periodical 
policy 
statements on big loans extended to individual or corporate 
borrowers who are related to bank owners or executives." 
Sudrajad said the Central Bank also would eventually oblige 
banks to write off their problem loans from their balance sheets 
and if this measure resulted in adequate capital these banks 
would have to increase their capital. 
  "If they fail to increase their capital, these banks will be 
required to merge with other banks," he added. 
  Meanwhile, State Minister for Development Planning Ginanjar 
Kartasasmita told a separate hearing with the House yesterday 
that Indonesia's official foreign debts (based on disbursement) 
as of March totaled $55.03 billion. 
  "Around $38.16 billion of the total were given by 
Indonesia's 
creditors affiliated with the Consultative Group on Indonesia 
and the other $16.87 billion were derived from other sources," 
he said.

  [Editorial Report] The 30 May Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 
on page 5 reported that, according to the Indonesian Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (Kadin), Indonesia's high-cost economy and 
the absence of Indonesian trading companies abroad are causing a 
drop in exports. Also included in the specific problem areas 
cited by Kadin's President Aburizal Bakrie were the legal and 
illegal levies on investment licenses, a "weak" industrial 
structure, and "less than skillful" businessmen. 
  One of Aburizal's suggestions was for businessmen to 
establish marketing offices overseas. Kadin's president also 
pointed out that it can no longer be assumed that low wages and 
an abundance of natural resources are sufficient to make 
Indonesia competitive against countries such as Vietnam and Sri 
Lanka. Aburizal hopes that there will be "greater transparency" 
on the part of the government and that it will formulate 
deregulations and tariffs with a view toward competitiveness and 
less government intervention.

<F P=106> [Article by economics department reporter Naoya Tsuchiya] </F>
  [Text] An official at a U.S. bank in Japan makes no attempt 
to conceal his discontent, saying, "The Tokyo offshore markets 
are replete with restrictions." Overseas short-term financial 
markets are flooded with high-tech financial instruments such as 
swaps, but the Tokyo offshore market deals only in the trading 
of limited capital instruments. It is said that "foreign banks 
cannot even deal in bonds or commercial paper." 
  The unofficial U.S. Government itemized listing of requested 
deregulating actions made public in the latter part of May 
included a request for further deregulation of the offshore 
markets. Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials display an air of 
calmness, saying, "We have not received any specific requests," 
but they are unable to conceal a bit of bewilderment at the 
sudden surfacing of the topic of deregulating offshore markets. 
This is obviously a case where the wishes of U.S. banks in Tokyo 
have been conveyed to the U.S. Government. 
  An offshore market is defined as one in which the 
procurement 
and management of capital by nonresident entities such as 
foreign governments and firms is allowed. In December 1986, an 
offshore market in the format of an international banking 
facility (IBF), separate from domestic transactions in Japan, 
was established. 
  Offshore transactions are exempt from the burden of reserve 
deposits as well as withholding taxes. Such features provide for 
capital transactions that are appealing because of lower costs. 
Offshore transactions are used to fill overseas investor needs 
for yen capital. According to MOF International Finance Bureau 
officials, they were initiated with fanfare given to the goal of 
"globalizing the yen and nurturing Tokyo into an international 
market." 
  As far as residential entities such as Japanese firms and 
individuals are concerned, only foreign exchange banks can 
participate in the offshore markets. Further, because of the 
fear that domestic transactions will be routed to offshore 
transactions since the latter are not subject to tax withholding 
actions, Japanese banks are required to establish special 
accounts to handle offshore transactions. 
  Specific methods prescribed to segregate domestic and 
offshore transactions include 1) measures to prevent excess 
receipts on a monthly basis on the domestic side on 
disbursements and receipts of capital between offshore and 
domestic transaction accounts, and 2) limiting the daily amount 
of capital gathered from offshore markets into domestic 
transaction accounts to 10 percent of the average operating 
balance for nonresident entities in the prior month. 
  In the offshore markets of New York which have required 
similar segregation of domestic and offshore transactions, the 
only requirement is an obligation to establish a reserve account 
even if capital is gathered into domestic accounts. There are no 
quantitative limitations such as in Japan, placing Tokyo in a 
category where strict regulations still exist even from an 
international perspective. 
  In reality, the Tokyo offshore market is plagued by slow 
growth. It grew at the rate of $200 billion a year for three 
years after initiation based on asset balances reflected in 
Japanese banks' offshore accounts, but growth since then has 
been very slow. Recently, yen-denominated transactions have 
grown faster than dollar-denominated transactions and 
dollar-denominated assets have grown because of the strong yen, 
but according to city bank sources, the real situation is such 
that "markets have hardly grown at all." 
  The Tokyo offshore market is notorious because of a 
proliferation of restrictions, but there was a time when 
regulations were relaxed. Limitations on daily capital gathered 
into domestic accounts were doubled in 1989. However, that 
action did not lead to a subsequent expansion in market scale. 
  The foremost goal of foreign capital in the area of 
deregulation is the abolishment of segregation in capital flow. 
There are those who claim that Bank of Japan [BOJ] manipulation 
of financial markets will not be completely effective unless 
capital transactions are segregated, but many foreign banks 
point out that "BOJ methods for market manipulation are 
sophisticated to the degree where there should be no adverse 
impact from abolishing capital segregation from offshore 
markets." Even within the BOJ, there is the view that "there is 
no need to insist on capital segregation." 
  In fact, the MOF's Tax Bureau opposes the direct abolishment 
of regulation. It fears that "such a move may lead to talk of 
abolishing tax withholdings on domestic capital transactions and 
there is the atmosphere that they don't even wish to discuss the 
matter because of a serious situation being confronted in the 
form of inadequate tax revenues. 
  Failure of the Tokyo offshore market to grow symbolizes the 
stalemate in the globalization of the Tokyo market. Deregulation 
of offshore markets is indispensable in the stimulation of 
markets. It is only a matter of time before foreign pressure 
increases, even if strong resistance is posed by supervisory 
authorities such as the MOF. Success or failure of further 
market opening actions can be considered as serving as a test in 
determining whether Tokyo markets can respond to another demand 
for globalization.
