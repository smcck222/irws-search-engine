<F P=106> [Article by economics department reporter Hideyuki Konaka] </F>
  [Text] An official of a foreign securities firm operating 
in Japan still bitterly complains of invisible barriers to entry 
into Japanese markets, saying, "It took five years from the date 
of the application until a permit was issued by the MOF. MOF 
officials would listen, but the process was very slow because of 
the vagueness of both standards and detailed procedures used in 
the approval process." 
  The law governing operation of foreign securities firms in 
Japan provides approval standards such as "adequate assets to 
ensure sound operations" and "adequate social trust," but it 
lacks any detailed regulations. That means that approval is 
subject, to a great degree, to the discretion of the officials 
handling each approval application. Moreover, foreign firms 
constantly voice the dissatisfaction that "the preliminary 
hearing stage leading to tentative approval is inordinately 
long." 
  During the preliminary hearing stage, the MOF provides a 
variety of "administrative guidance" concerning systems required 
to operate a securities firm in Japan. It is said that each 
piece of administrative guidance issued by the MOF must be 
followed by submission of a written response by the applying 
firm and that each submission reaches a thickness of almost 10 
centimeters. Once this process is completed, submission of a 
formal request is finally approved by the MOF. MOF officials 
admit that it is normal that "the process of tentative approval, 
submission of application, and formal approval takes one month, 
but inclusion of the preliminary review stage extends the normal 
time requirement to one or two years." In other words, the 
advance "guidance period" consumes the majority of the total 
processing time. 
  MOF officials rebut charges of vagueness by saying, "Unlike 
the United States where you start with the submission of an 
application for a permit, we provide appropriate guidance 
beforehand. We feel that you can call this a case of being 
helpful," but to foreigners such Japanese-style administrative 
guidance systems have a tendency of appearing to be "vague." 
  Even in the "financial services" sector of the Japan-U.S. 
trade talks, a strong case is being made for attaining 
transparency in approval and legal systems. This issue first 
surfaced in the "Japan-U.S. Yen-Dollar Committee" meeting of 
1984 and has since been mentioned at every opportunity, 
including the Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
  During the insurance sector talks held on 1 and 2 June in 
Tokyo, the U.S. side's trade and commerce action officer said, 
"We would like to see the establishment of transparency and 
clarification of provisions for permits and regulation and the 
provision of clear-cut standards for approval of insurance 
products," and renewed their request for improvement of 
administrative guidance. The U.S. officials also stressed that 
"transparency has been made a topic in trade talks for as many 
as 10 years," and made no effort to conceal their frustration at 
Japan's slowness in making improvements. 
  The U.S. perception of the situation is reflected in the 
report concerning trade barriers compiled at the end of March 
1994 by the U.S. Trade Representative. 
  Under the item concerning "financial services" in Japan, the 
report discusses as a system issue the "lack of transparency." 
The report first covers the current situation by referring to 
the specific case of the insurance law by commenting, "It is 
limited to general rules and relies on administrative guidance 
for specific regulation." Additionally, it states that 
participation by foreign firms is difficult because of the lack 
of clear-cut standards and a problem exists in that there is no 
way to determine whether the MOF treats foreign and Japanese 
firms in a different manner. 
  The Japanese Government has finally shown signs of reviewing 
the status of administrative guidance in response to criticism 
of this nature from overseas sources. 
  The first move in this direction is the Administrative 
Procedures Law to be implemented in October 1994. That law is 
aimed at providing for fairness and transparency in 
administrative procedures to the degree possible by establishing 
common rules for handling permits and related actions which were 
previously covered in individual pieces of legislation. 
  The law provides for delineation of "purpose," "content," 
and 
"responsible individuals" concerning administrative guidance and 
provides that oral guidance must be issued in writing to cover 
the three listed points whenever so requested. The law will 
provide for comprehension of such documentation by third parties 
and affected parties hope that it will eliminate vague 
administrative guidance. 
  However, comments are being made that this law alone will 
not 
provide for the resolution of vagueness in administrative 
guidance. A source at a city bank gives as a reason, 
"administrative guidance is the product of collusion between 
government agencies and industry. A problem exists in industry 
which has "accepted vague administrative guidance from 
government agencies through a process of telepathy." It appears 
we can say that the system reflects Japanese-type perceptions 
symbolized in administrative guidance which requires 
modification.

  [Text] Kin -- Over burdened with military exercises that 
U.S. Forces in Okinawa have frequently conducted near 
residential areas, residents in Igei District, Kin Town, set up 
signs reading saying "All Military Vehicles Are Prohibited From 
Using This Road" in two locations on 16 June. In this way, the 
residents clearly manifested their objection to the passage of 
U.S. military vehicles through their district. Igei District is 
located near a Camp Hansen training ground and U.S. Forces have 
intensified guerrilla warfare training in Range-5F (jungle 
warfare) since late May; Range-5F is located near a reservoir 
forest. A growing number of U.S. military vehicles have passed 
through the district to the range. Igei District chief Masafumi 
Ikehara said: "Setting up those sings is our inevitable 
response to protect our children's educational climate and the 
lives of our residents." 
  Igei District villages are hundreds meters away from 
Range-5F. During live-firing training, rounds land near the 
reservoir forest, which is a source of water for the residents. 
According to a resident, U.S. troops fire their automatic 
rifles, mortars, and other heavy weapons during their training, 
and the sounds are audible. 
  Tsuneo Nakama, chairman of the Igei District Administrative 
Committee, has said: "It is highly possible that fire caused by 
the training could burn the reservoir forest and there is a fear 
of stray bullets." On 3 June, the committee adopted a 
resolution demanding that the live-firing exercise be halted, 
Range-5F be removed, and the passage of U.S. military vehicles 
through the district be prohibited. The committee has asked Kin 
Town and the Okinawa Prefectural Government to make the same 
demand, but training still continues unabated in Range-5F and 
the number of U.S. military vehicles passing through the 
district is growing. 
  U.S. military vehicles pass through residential areas in 
accordance with "the Japan-U.S. Status of Force Agreement 
[SOFA]." American troops and military vehicles freely pass over 
almost all roads in Okinawa in the name of "their movement 
between military installations." 
  Masafumi Ikehara has vented his anger over damage inflicted 
by U.S. military bases, saying: "No matter SOFA, it is 
ridiculous that U.S. Forces in Okinawa are threatening the lives 
of our residents without listening to their opinions. U.S. 
Forces in Okinawa have continued to cause accidents in Igei 
District during their training and our district is like a 
battlefield. We can no longer tolerate the frequent passage of 
U.S. military vehicles through our district." 
  Each of the two signs, measuring 1.8 meter in height and 0.9 
meter in width, was set up at a farm road near Range-5F and at 
the entrance to the town road in the village. The two signs 
read in English, "Any Military Vehicles Are Prohibited To Go 
Through This Road." Igei District, that put up the two signs, 
plans to stringently check the passage of U.S. military vehicles 
through the district and check on training by U.S. Forces in 
Okinawa.

  [Text] Tokyo -- The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee held a 
meeting at the New Sanno U.S. Forces Center in Minato-ku, Tokyo 
on 16 June. In the meeting, committee members agreed to 
establish a "task force" under the Special Committee on 
Facilities [SCF] to deal with the issue concerning the return of 
Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. The task force will be composed of 
working-level officials from the U.S. Forces Headquarters in 
Japan, the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency [DFAA]. It will discuss technical matters 
about the issue of providing U.S. forces with a substitute for 
the airfield, and the possibility of removing Sobe 
communications site, which is adjacent to the airfield, to 
another place. Commenting on the establishment of the task 
force, DFAA Director General Ichiro Yoneyama said: "I hope it 
will work for the return of the airfield." The task force is 
scheduled to hold its first meeting before the end of June. 
  DFAA Facilities Coordination Officer Akira Sato has been 
appointed Japanese chairman of the task force. The Foreign 
Ministry is currently looking for suitable officials for members 
of the force. Colonel Malepoty [name as published], SCF 
chairman, is in charge of selecting U.S. members. It is 
expected that about 20 Japanese and U.S. officials will be 
picked as task force members before the first meeting is held. 
  U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner recently visited 
Japan to attend a meeting of the Consultative Committee of 
Japan- U.S. Security. On that occasion, Wisner and Yoneyama 
agreed that "developed communications technology may make the 
current vast radio wave buffer zone unnecessary." Thus, the 
task force is expected to look for a substitute for Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield, and to discuss in detail technical aspects 
of two possible measures to return the airfield to the locality 
-- one is removing Sobe communications facilities to other site 
and the other is reducing the size of the buffer zone. 
  With the establishment of the task force, the existing "task 
force to study removal of parachute training area at Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield" was dissolved. This task force was 
established in 1982 to survey suitable land for a substitute. 
It has proposed several sites as a substitute. The results of 
the survey will be given to the new task force. 
  In recent years, problems concerning the return of Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield, the return of Naha Military Port, and the 
suspension of live shell firing exercises across highway 104 
have drawn attention as three pending issues. The establishment 
of the new task force is expected to help make progress in 
solving the airfield issue. 
  Meanwhile, Joint Committee members also agreed on the return 
of a 16,000-square-meter lot located east of Camp Kuwae, which 
Chatan town has demanded to construct a health center there.

  [Text] Yomitan -- The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee has 
established a task force to deal with the issue concerning the 
return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. Yomitan village is 
welcoming this move. Deputy Mayor Keizo Yasuda said: "The 
official establishment of the task force will help promote the 
study of specific measures (for the airfield's return). This is 
a big step forward." 
  Meanwhile, the village is surprised that besides "the issue 
of looking for a substitute for the parachute training area in 
the airfield," "the possibility of removing Onna communications 
site" is also included in the items the task force is to 
discuss. The village has long thought that there was little 
possibility that the Onna communications site (also called the 
elephant's cage) would be removed. Thus, it has demanded the 
return of a part (0.6 hectare) of the airfield, not the whole of 
it, which covers 53 hectares. Taking into account the assertion 
that a radio wave buffer zone is indispensable for the 
communications site, the village has drawn up a returned land 
development plan that does not hinder the functions of the 
communications site. Thus, the village is perplexed at the fact 
that the task force will study the communications site's 
removal. Yasuda said: "We never expected the removal of the 
communications site would surface." 
  Nevertheless, the village is welcoming the establishment of 
the task force. Yasuda said: "It can be said that this is the 
result of our campaign calling for the airfield's return. We 
have conducted the campaign since Okinawa's reversion to Japan 
20 years ago. We expect and believe that a concrete result (a 
decision to return the airfield to the village) will be achieved 
in time for the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war."

<F P=106> [First in three-part series entitled: "Moves Are Afoot To </F>
Streamline and Integrate U.S. Military Bases on Okinawa": "Naha 
Military Port"] 
  [Text] Naha Military Port, Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and 
live-firing exercises across the prefectural highway are three 
major issues involving U.S. Forces on Okinawa and they symbolize 
the problems arising from having U.S. military bases here. The 
U.S. side, which calls the three major issues the Big Three, has 
asked the Japanese Government to come up with ways to relocate, 
streamline, and integrate U.S. military bases on Okinawa. The 
Japanese Government, which has so far entrusted the U.S. side 
with the power to handle the relocation, streamlining, and 
integration of the U.S. bases, is being pressed to coordinate 
the views of Okinawan residents in areas where some U.S. 
military bases are relocated; and to study ways to secure the 
cost of relocating U.S. artillery units on Okinawa. The 
Japanese Government has yet to give the United States a clear 
answer. Burdened with the U.S. military bases, Okinawa is about 
to greet the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific War. 
When pleading directly to the U.S. Government, Prefectural 
Governor Ota has asked them to resolve the three major issues, 
among other things. The OKINAWA TIMES has filed urgent reports 
on the intentions of both Japan and the United States, who have 
begun moving toward settling the three major issues as a 
priority matter, and the Okinawa Prefectural Government's 
response to such moves. 
  In U.S.-Japan security talks in 1974 -- two years after 
Okinawa's reversal to Japanese rule -- the two sides agreed that 
Naha Military Port would be returned on condition that an 
alternative site was provided by Japan. The temporary use of 
the military port by U.S. Forces on Okinawa has continued for 20 
years after the agreement was reached between Japan and the 
United States; 75 percent of U.S. military installations in 
Japan are concentrated on Okinawa. It has been said that the 
"agreement is irrational" because it conditions the return of 
the military port on its relocation in Okinawa, one- fifth of 
which is occupied by U.S. military bases. 
  A relocation proposal put forth by the U.S. Forces on 
Okinawa 
to the Japanese Government is that an area inside Makiminato 
Supply Depot be used as the site for a new military port and the 
supply depot be located to a coastal area. The coastal area of 
Makiminato, Urasoe City is now under development and the 
relocation proposal is that a berth be established along the 
coastal area and linked to the supply depot by road. 
  If Naha Military Port is relocated to the area inside 
Makiminato Supply Depot, the current military port located at 
the gate to Okinawa will disappear and the new military port 
will be half the size of Naha Military Port. The merits of Naha 
Military Port's relocation are great. The new military port 
will be located near the capital of Okinawa and in a western 
coastal development area which will become a key area for future 
industrial development on Okinawa. It still remains uncertain 
whether Urasoe City will accept the proposal to relocate Naha 
Military Port to an area under its jurisdiction. The relocation 
of Naha Military Port is expected to go through many twists and 
turns. 
  The relocation and scaling back of Naha Military Port is 
taken as an indication of certain headway in Okinawa's 
interests. A high- level political judgment is required, 
however, to have Naha Military Port completely withdrawn from 
Okinawa. Prefectural Governor Ota has asserted: "The U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa should be streamlined or integrated by 
relocating them across Japan, and the Japanese should bear the 
burden of their country's security equitably." The prevailing 
view is that his assertion will be hard to realize. 
  Kosuke Uehara, former director general of the Okinawa 
Development Agency, has persisted in his view: "It is necessary 
to take a realistic approach; no headway can be made without 
such an approach in resolving problems arising from U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa." Some Okinawans take the view that it 
is necessary to study ways to break the status quo by relocating 
and integrating U.S. military bases within Okinawa. 
  If some U.S. military bases are relocated on condition that 
alternative sites are provided on Okinawa, like Naha Military 
Port, this will pressure the Okinawans to make decisions that 
may entail some pain.

  [Text] Concerning the reversion of the Naha Military Port 
and the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip -- two major sites concerning 
the military base issue on Okinawa -- it has been learned by 16 
June that the United States has prepared plans of its own 
accommodating the prefectural government's requests and has 
presented them to the Japanese Government. According to 
information supplied by several officials concerned, the U.S. 
plans -- which propose to merge Naha Port facilities into the 
Makiminato Supply Depot in Urasoe City and to return the Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airstrip completely -- were presented to the 
Japan-U.S. Joint Committee early this year. Meanwhile, the 
Japanese Government is cautious about its course of action 
because of the possibility of reaction arising from the local 
area to which the facilities may be moved, and has not made a 
clear response yet. Apparently, both cases will need to be 
resolved through U.S. leadership. 
  On the issue of the Naha Military Port, the U.S. plans 
propose to install berths on which vessels can dock in the area 
of Makiminato, where the western coast development project is 
now underway, and to use the Supply Depot as a backup area for 
supply storage. The merger plan envisages reducing the scale of 
the military port by about half of what it is today. 
  The U.S. Armed Forces used to say "it is essential to have a 
backup area of the size of the Naha Military Port in order to 
store supplies for contingencies," but they think that problem 
can be solved by securing a route linking the berths and the 
collection area in the supply depot. 
  As for the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip, the armed forces have 
shown their intention to return all of it, and are now studying 
how to solve the radiowave problems of the Sobe Communications 
Station (Zono-ori), to which the parachuting exercise site will 
be moved. 
  At present, the Chubu training ground in Camp Hansen between 
Kin- cho and Ginoza-son is being cited as a possible candidate 
for the parachute exercise site. On 16 June, the Japan-U.S. 
Joint Committee agreed to establish a working group to discuss 
the specifics of the return of the airstrip. 
  The package of U.S. plans for solving the issues, comprised 
of specific removal and integration plans, was presented by U.S. 
representatives at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee session. 
  As far as the problem of the live-fire exercise over 
Prefectural Highway 104 is concerned, the U.S. forces are 
studying a plan to move almost all of the exercise to the East 
Fuji Training Ground in Shizuoka Prefecture. The live-fire 
exercise has been another major issues along with the other two 
concerning the return of facilities. 
  The plan appears to envision removing this exercise, now 
conducted from 30 to 40 days a year on Okinawa, to the East Fuji 
Training Ground. The U.S. Government is expected to ask the 
Japanese Government to bear the costs of transporting troops for 
the exercise. The transport costs will amount to about $1 
million for each exercise. Since Japan is not allowed to 
directly assist combat operations, including exercises under the 
existing Status-of-Forces Agreement, the conclusion of a new 
treaty will become necessary in order for the Japanese 
Government to be able to bear the costs of transporting the 
troops.

U.S. Military Presence Seen In the 21st Century As Tension 
Mitigates"] 
  [Text] National security policy planners are required to 
foresee what is ahead in the next l0 years or more -- if 
possible 30 years -- and at the same time, to review the past 
and present situation. 
  If the upcoming national defense buildup program is going to 
cover a five-year period as it has previously, it will cover the 
period from fiscal year 1996 to 2000. 
  Warships, aircraft, and the like requisitioned under the 
program are to be made ready, and the reorganization of units is 
to be completed sometime around 2005. This equipment will be 
deployed and used at the first-line until 2025 or 2030. 
  Planning a security program from the viewpoint of today's 
situation will render the future policy completely inadequate. 
  Although it is impossible to correctly predict the world and 
domestic situation or the development of scientific technology, 
a challenge must be made to guarantee security. 
  Today's utmost concern is the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms 
development program and its stalled economy, but it is highly 
likely these issues will be settled by the early part of the 
next century. 
A Reduction of U.S. Forces in Japan Is Possible [subhead] 
  In May, the 21st Century Committee, an advisory organ of ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam, submitted a report entitled: "The 
Republic of Korea in the 21st Century," predicting "the high 
possibility of the DPRK's economic collapse within three to five 
years, and Korean unification by 2020." 
  Last year, the DPRK was presumed to have produced 3,880,000 
tons of grain, comprising 60 percent of the 6,500,000 tons it 
actually needed; the lack of foreign exchange reserves prevented 
it from importing foodstuffs. If this situation continues, the 
North Korean economy will not last long. 
  Meanwhile, if the DPRK adopts an open-door policy in order 
to 
attract foreign investment, the foundation of the Worker's 
Party-controlled DPRK regime -- which has shut off information 
from foreign countries and given its people falsified reports of 
the poverty-ridden ROK -- will be shaken. The report's contents 
are thus considered timely. 
  Russia's armed forces have experienced considerable 
hollowing 
out in the Far East, with less and less requisitioning of new 
arms and equipment. There are even insufficient personnel funds 
to pay wages -- because of the late payment and non-payments of 
officers' wages, their wives and children held a demonstration 
in Sakhalin. It will require decades for Russia to regain its 
status as a military power. 
  The modernization program of the Chinese armed forces is 
progressing at a far slower pace than those of Japan, the ROK, 
and Taiwan (Republic of China). The United States, which 
informed the world of "China bending toward expanded armaments," 
has completely reversed its position from that of last year. 
  The U.S. Department of Defense approached China for a 
"U.S.-Chinese military exchange," to see if the United States 
can sell its weaponry to China. However, the Chinese Government 
seems to be in no position to allow rapid modernization of its 
armed forces, because of perennial huge budget deficits since 
1986. Nominal increases in the publicly announced defense 
budget are huge but are paralleled by the inflation rate. 
  When the Korean peninsula is united, a drastic reduction in 
U.S. Armed Forces in Japan will be possible. This is especially 
true of the U.S. Third Marine Division which maintains a large 
complex of facilities on Okinawa. Originally, the division was 
intended for landing operations in the case of contingencies on 
the Korean peninsula, and was on the verge of dissolution last 
year in former Defense Secretary Les Aspin's plan [sentence as 
published]. But it has survived temporarily because of tensions 
revolving around the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development 
program. 
  The 12th Marine Air Group at Iwakuni, with about 60 aircraft 
comprised of FA-18 Hornet fighter bombers and AV-8 Harriers, 
will become defunct when the Third Marine Division is dissolved 
as it supports the Marines. 
<H5>  The U.S. Is Going Allout To Stop Financial Deterioration </H5>
  The 18th Air Wing with 54 F-15 Eagle fighter-bombers at 
Kadena Airbase on Okinawa is ready to send reinforcement to the 
ROK. Even now several Eagles are being dispatched to Osan 
Airbase. This unit will become obsolete. 
  The landing crafts at Sasebo are for the transport of the 
Third Marine Division and they can be reduced. The old-type 
aircraft carrier Independence and its escort ships at Yokosuka 
need not remain in Japan. The carrier may be destined for 
retirement from service. The 432d Air Wing with 48 F-16 
Fighting Falcons at Misawa Airbase, Aomori Prefecture, will lose 
its reason for being there as the United States and Russia are 
now partners, and if the Korean peninsula is unified. 
  The colossal U.S. financial deficit has no prospects of 
being 
reduced, and the danger of the dollar's collapse in value 
constitutes the biggest factor in world instability. 
  The United States is compelled to make its prime objective 
preventing the financial deficit from deteriorating further, in 
order to protect its economic order and that of the world. 
  Even if the Japan-U.S. security system remains effective in 
the 21st century, it will become something close to an "alliance 
without U.S. military presence." Historically speaking, that is 
an ordinary form of alliance.

  [Text] In connection with the issue of DPRK's (North 
Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons, the chances are 
improving for the ROK and the DPRK to hold talks. For example, 
there have been new moves for holding a South-North summit. In 
this connection, the government has indicated that it "welcomes" 
as stated by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa such developments. 
Considering that future developments are still unpredictable, 
however, the government plans to keep a wary eye on new 
developments, such as how North Korea may respond to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) call for inspections 
of its nuclear facilities. At the same time, the government 
plans to maintain closer ties with the United States and the ROK. 
  The ROK and the DPRK have reached an agreement on holding a 
South-North summit, with ROK President Kim Yong-sam accepting 
DPRK President Kim Il-song's call for holding a summit meeting. 
Regarding this summit, a senior official at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "That is excellent. Originally, 
President Kim Yong-sam had called for such a summit ever since 
his inauguration, but it never came about because North Korea 
kept insisting on holding talks with the United States only." 
This is how MOFA views the situation. Regarding the flexible 
stance the DPRK is now showing, MOFA has analyzed that with 
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter acting practically as a 
special envoy in a series of high-level talks with President Kim 
Il-song, "North Korea's dignity has been preserved," (according 
to a government source). 
  The government believes that should a South-North summit 
meeting be held, the ROK Government is expected to press North 
Korea to live up to the joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which came into effect 
in February 1992 when the two countries were pursuing a policy 
of mutual harmony. Talks are also expected to be held regarding 
wiping out mutual distrust. 
  In some quarters of the Japanese Government, however, there 
are deep-rooted feelings of distrust toward North Korea since 
the latter has been noted to shift between hardline and flexible 
stances in the past. Therefore, some government officials are 
not necessarily optimistic about future developments. Rather, 
they plan to remain calm and keep a wary eye on how the 
situation may develop. 
  The government places particular emphasis on the outcome of 
working-level meetings to be held as early as 20 June for 
working out details in preparation for the third round of the 
U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. This is because the government 
expects that aside from negotiations conducted by Carter at the 
private level, there will be a considerable exchange of opinions 
on such issues as nuclear inspections at the government level. 
  Moreover, the government is concerned about views that the 
United States may decide not to pursue questioning North Korea 
on its suspected nuclear developments in the past. A top 
government official has said: "The U.S. Government has explained 
to us that it does not intend to drop past issues at all." 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada has said: "Past 
issues cannot be dropped." The government thus plans to confirm 
U.S. intentions during talks with the U.S. Government.

  [Text] ROK President Kim Yong-sam accepted DPRK President 
Kim Il-song's proposal to hold unconditionally a South-North 
summit as soon as possible. In this regard, the Japanese 
Government on 18 June welcomed the acceptance, saying that "it 
is in line with Japan's idea of peacefully settling the issue" 
(according to Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa). Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said: "The circumstances favor the settling of the 
issue of the suspected development of nuclear weapons. We by 
all means hope that because of this, the talks will be 
successful." In this way, Japan is strongly hoping for the 
realization of the South-North summit talks. 
  However, some Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] officials 
are saying that the true objective of North Korea's call to hold 
the South-North summit, which will be the first of its kind in 
the history of the two countries, is "still not clear." They 
are wary of the proposal and say that "it might be a DPRK tactic 
to gain time." Because of this, the government plans to 
"carefully observe developments concerning the South-North 
summit talks while holding closer contacts than before between 
Japan, the United States, and the ROK and while unifying the 
three countries' objectives in dealing with North Korea" 
(according to a senior MOFA official). 
  The uncertainty concerning the relationship between the 
resumption of the third round of U.S.-DPRK negotiations, for 
which the time is becoming ripe, and the holding of the 
South-North summit is one of the reasons why the MOFA is feeling 
uneasy. 
  Preparations are being made for a resumption of the 
U.S.-DPRK 
negotiations, on the condition that North Korea freezes its 
nuclear weapons development program. Issues such as North 
Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections and methods of 
verifying the DPRK's past extraction of plutonium will be 
discussed in the negotiations. On the other hand, the 
aforementioned matters, of course, will also be discussed at the 
South-North summit talks and at working-level meetings to 
prepare for the summit. 
  However, the "difference in temperature" between the United 
States and the ROK over the issue of the "verification of past 
events" has been pointed out. The MOFA is worried by the 
possibility that "North Korea may be trying to disturb 
cooperation between Japan, the United States, and the ROK by 
saying different things during negotiations with the ROK and the 
United States" (according to a MOFA source). Some people 
analyze the situation as that "North Korea's true intention is 
to gain time and to avoid sanctions by increasing channels for 
discussions" (according to a government source). Moreover, some 
other people are warning against an optimistic view. They say 
that a "future of discussions through the two channels will be 
tough" (according to a MOFA source).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Still Cannot Be Optimistic About the Future </F>
of the `North's' Suspected Nuclear Arms Development"] 
  [Text] There is a new movement afoot to find a way out of 
the current situation concerning the DPRK's (North Korea) 
suspected nuclear arms development. However, it seems that 
enforcement of nuclear inspections on facilities not declared by 
the DPRK, which are the key to dissolving suspicion, and other 
matters, depend on future vice ministerial talks between the 
United States and the DPRK. There will be twists and turns 
before the suspicion is completely dissolved. We believe 
international society will have no choice but to continue to 
send strong messages to the DPRK. 
  President Clinton announced he will agree to the holding of 
U.S.-DPRK vice ministerial talks if North Korea freezes its 
nuclear arms development program. This is a result of his 
appraisal of President Kim Il-song's pledges made at a meeting 
with Former President Carter. Among other things, Kim Il-song 
promised he will allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspectors to remain in North Korea. However, international 
society needs to watch the development of U.S.-DPRK talks to 
make sure North Korea's recent attitude is not designed merely 
to gain some time. 
  We cannot have an optimistic view of the future because it 
appears to us that North Korea's past actions have been nothing 
but an abuse of its nuclear cards. Last year, North Korea 
announced it would secede from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (NPT) and is still mulling this decision. This time, 
immediately before the Carter-Kim talks, North Korea announced 
it would split from the IAEA. This is a North Korean tactic of 
making its compromises look big by raising hurdles before 
negotiations and lowering them afterward. 
  We can say the United States and the rest of international 
society have been fooled by these tactics and forced to make 
compromises over the past several years. For example, when the 
suspected nuclear arms development was disclosed, the United 
States demanded North Korea accept not only IAEA inspections but 
also mutual inspections by North and South. Now, however, the 
United States is demanding North Korea accept "inspections by 
the IAEA at least." 
  Initially, the United States said acceptance of special 
inspections of facilities which have not been declared is a 
prerequisite for resuming U.S.-DPRK talks. Now, the United 
States is calling for resumption of talks by actually 
withdrawing the prerequisite. International society is giving 
such considerations in order not to corner North Korea. If it 
is a member of international society, North Korea has a 
responsibility to sincerely respond to the call. 
  We pointed out before that international society needs to 
take practical actions to settle the North Korean issue. We 
also said that, if circumstances require it would be unavoidable 
for international society to be prepared for the possibility of 
imposing sanctions, while aiming to settle the issue through 
dialogue. 
  The United States already announced a draft proposal for 
sanctions which will be studied at the UNSC [United Nations 
Security Council]. The draft proposal calls for introduction of 
a 30-day grace period before sanctions and imposing them in two 
stages. It shows the United States' hope of avoiding an attempt 
to incite North Korea. 
  President Kim Il-song's true intentions are still not clear. 
But, we would like to believe that what he told Mr. Carter -- if 
it was North Korea's willingness to settle the issue in a 
positive manner -- is the result of efforts by international 
society. We cannot coexist with a Korea peninsula armed with 
nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons on the peninsula will 
jeopardize stability in Northeast Asia and could create a 
dangerous situation in which Japan may start talking about 
owning nuclear weapons. 
  We cannot allow North Korea to gain time. We strongly hope 
that North Korea will promise international society to freeze 
its nuclear arms development project without delay, and it will 
accept inspections of its nuclear facilities, including those 
which have not been declared.

  [Text] Concerning the no-confidence motion against the 
Hata cabinet, a top leader of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
stated on 19 June: "It is hoped that discussions will be held 
on setting a time limit (for submitting the motion)." He seems 
to be concerned with the possibility that if the Social 
Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ)] 
carries out prolonged consultations with the ruling coalition 
parties without reaching any conclusions before the current Diet 
session comes to an end (on 29 June), it will become impossible 
to submit the no-confidence motion, or even if it were 
submitted, the LDP alone cannot have it adopted. Therefore, in 
setting a time limit, the LDP intends to urge the SDPJ to make 
its decision on going along with the LDP policy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Honda Motor To Study Auto Production </F>
in China; Considering Investing in Local Passenger Car Company"] 
  [Text] Honda Motor has begun looking into capital 
investment in "Dongfeng Automobile Co." (Hubei), a core auto 
group of China, in order to embark on passenger car production 
in China. They are thinking of constructing a factory for 
engines and other parts and beginning mass production of an 
"Accord" class passenger car in 1996 in a joint venture with the 
corporation. They have exchanged signatures with the Chinese 
government to begin study of commercialization soon, and will 
decide on a plan within the year. Among Japanese auto makers, 
Mitsubishi Motors is studying the construction of an engine 
plant by a three-nation joint venture with the participation of 
Malaysia, and it seems that full-scale expansion into China by 
Japanese auto makers is accelerating. 
  The Donfeng Automobile Co. with whom Honda is studying 
capital participation, is the former Second Auto works and is 
positioned as one corner of the "Big Three" of China's priority 
auto business group, the "Big Three, Little Three, and Micro 
Two." 
  Honda decided on a plan in July last year to supply engine 
and pressed parts of the "Civic" from Japan to the Guangzhou 
Yangcheng Auto Corp, financed by Guangzhou city, Guangdong 
Province, and assemble them locally. However, the Chinese 
government, which is seeking to shift parts technology under 
central leadership, would not give permission for such a 
regional project. 
  For this reason, Honda decided to open up an alternative for 
passenger car production in the country by investing in Dongfeng 
which has deep relations with the Chinese government. Citroen of 
France has capital participation in Dongfeng and is building a 
passenger car plant for annual production of 150,000 cars, but 
according to Honda, it is possible for the Chinese government to 
permit passenger car production by Honda separate from Citroen. 
  In the new auto policy for 1996 and thereafter which China 
has informally decided, it is a requirement to have the rate of 
domesticly produced parts over 40 percent as a condition for 
permitting new participation of foreign capital in auto 
production. The idea is that Honda will initially produce 
150,000 passenger car engines annually, and while increasing the 
[Chinese] domestic content rate, will assemble and produce 
2000-cc displacement "Accord" class passenger cars beginning in 
1996 to be supplied for the Chinese market. Some of the parts 
will be exported to Southeast Asia such as Thailand.

  [Text] Toyota Motor Corp. has begun assembly production of 
the passenger car "Camry" (Japanese name "Scepter") in Malaysia 
with parts supplied from Japan and Australia. Previously, all 
parts were procured from Japan for passenger car production in 
Malaysia. This is the first time for overseas assembly 
production that parts circulate between three countries. 
  It is the Assembly Service Company of Malaysia that has 
begun 
assembly production. The company is an assembly company 
100-percent financed by the local agency of Toyota, and it 
produces Toyota passenger cars and commercial vehicles. It had 
produced the passenger cars "Corolla" and "Corona," but because 
the Corona did not suit the local market and sales were 
dropping, it was switched to the "Camry." It produces 100 to 200 
cars a month. 
  In production of the "Camry," undercarriage parts such as 
the 
transmission are supplied from Japan, and body parts and 
interior items from Australia. Some minor parts are procured 
locally in Malaysia. The parts procurement rate is 65 percent 
from Japan, 25 percent from Australia, and the remaining 10 
percent locally. 
  As an export promotion policy, Australia considers import 
portions corresponding to the amount of exports to be duty-free. 
Toyota is producing the "Camry" in Australia and if it supplies 
parts to Malaysia, it can receive preferential tax treatment in 
procurement of parts from Japan. Toyota has decided to aim at 
creating an optimum parts procurement system by this mutual 
circulating of parts.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric is increasing production of 
elevators in their three Asian bases of China, Thailand, and 
Taiwan. They will boost to nearly 14,000 the number of units 
produced at all three bases in a five-year plan in stages, an 
increase of about 50 percent over the present. Moreover, they 
will put effort into the export of high-speed elevators from 
Japan. They are covering sluggish domestic demand and spurring 
the elevator business by proceeding to open up Asian markets 
where the construction rush continues backed by rapid economic 
development. 
  The bases decided for this increased production are 
"Mitsubishi Elevator Asia" (annual production of 2,000 units), a 
fully financed company in Thailand; "Shanghai Mitsubishi 
Elevator Ltd." (annual production of 4,000 units), a joint 
venture company in China; and a Taiwan joint venture company 
(annual production of 3,000 units). Production there totalled 
9,000 units in 1993. Almost all of the products are for Asia, 
and the Mitsubishi Group is selling 10,000 units in the same 
region, including Japanese and South Korean production. 
  According to the increased production plan, the program for 
the period of the next five years is to boost annual production 
respectively to 3,500 units in Thailand, 5,400-5,500 units in 
Shanghai, and 4,700-,800 units in Taiwan. It is estimated that 
the number of units produced when the plan is finished will be 
nearly 14,000, about a 50 percent increase compared to 1993. 
They plan that the number of units sold in the Asian region at 
that point in time, including exports from Japan and production 
in South Korea, will be over 18,000 units annually. 
  A construction rush of high-rise buildings and homes is 
continuing along with economic development in Asia, and it is 
expected that the demand for elevators will greatly increase in 
the future. Particularly in China, it is anticipated that the 
annual market scale will reach 30,000 units in a few years and 
it will grow into the world's largest market. Starting with 
Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi, major U.S. and European 
firms such as Otis Elevator of the United States and Schindler 
Lift of Switzerland are also embarking on business expansion.

  [Text] Taihei Dengyo, a plant construction company, has 
received an order from Hong Kong Electric Power for construction 
work on coal thermoelectric power plants. Hong Kong Electric 
Power is building two 350,000 kilowatt electric power facilities 
as part of the electric power base that it has been developing 
on Lamma Island since 1980. The amount of the order is about 11 
billion yen, and it will be the largest overseas project that 
the company has received by itself. Taking advantage of this, it 
is thinking of trying to get orders for power plants in China. 
  The order received is for execution of the No. 7 and No. 8 
Hong Kong Lamma Island thermoelectric power stations. They are 
coal power stations with an output of 350,000 kilowatts, and 
will be built on a site of about 50,000 square meters. No. 7 is 
scheduled to begin operation in December 1995, and No. 8 in 
December 1997. The company has already dispatched about 10 
technicians to the site and begun steel framework on the boiler 
portion. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was in charge of design. 
  The two power facilities are comprised of a turbine 
generator, boiler, desulfurization equipment, coal conveyor 
facility, and coal incineration ash collection device, and the 
company is in charge of this work as a package. It is expected 
that it will dispatch at peak times about 50 expert technicians 
in charge of the boiler, electrical controls, etc. Actual 
execution will be left to three local cooperating companies such 
as Power Generation Process Corp. (Hong Kong). However, it is 
expected that company technicians will be in charge of important 
portions such as the boiler welding work. 
  The Lamma Island Power Plant construction project began in 
1980, and so far six coal thermoelectric power plants and six 
gas turbine power facilities are in operation. The performance 
of the company in undertaking jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries execution of five coal thermoelectric power plants 
and gas turbines was assessed and it succeeded in receiving this 
order. 
  When Hong Kong returns to China in 1997, it appears that 
Hong 
Kong Electric Power, which has ample capital, will embark on 
construction of power plants in Mainland China. Taihei Dengyo is 
strengthening its relationship with Hong Kong Electric Power by 
this big order and would like to receive orders for power plant 
construction work in China that is anticipated in the future.

  [Text] Tokyo Gas will begin to supply homes with city gas 
service within a year in Malaysia, proceeding as a joint venture 
with the Malaysian state-operated oil refinery company Petronas 
and others. Previously, only the tile industry and other large 
industrial users were considered targets, but since business has 
gotten on track, it is also expanding to home use. For the time 
being, Tokyo Gas will proceed experimentally in order to 
consolidate know-how, but it is planning to extend it to the 
capital of Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding area, with 50,000 
homes a year as the goal in 1997 and thereafter. 
  Tokyo Gas established Gas Malaysia in 1992 in a joint 
venture 
with Petronas, Mitsui &amp; Co., and two local firms, and has 
been 
developing the gas business for industrial users in Kuala 
Lumpur, Kelang, and Johor Baharu. The Tokyo Gas investment ratio 
is 20 percent. The amount of gas sold in 1993 exceeded 100 
million cubic meters, and the outlook has become that it will be 
in the black in terms of profit and loss by 1997. 
  For this reason, it is expanding to the home market with the 
aim of stable expansion of business in the future. As the first 
shot, it will supply 100 company residences at an auto plant in 
Sharam, a new industrial city on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. 
In Malaysia, 90 percent of home fuel is liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG), but it is anticipated that LNG [liquefied natural gas] 
will be cheaper in fuel cost and will be fully competitive. It 
will expand to 1,000 homes in the Sharam area by the end of 
1996, and consolidate know-how on supply safety and fee 
collection. 
  In 1997 and thereafter, the policy is to widen the supply 
area, with places where there are existing industrial users as 
the nucleus, and the plan is to expand to 600,000 homes by 2011. 
It is the first time for city gas for general home use in 
Malaysia, and since there is no experience related to plumbing, 
maintenance inspection, and gas appliances, Tokyo Gas will 
accept and train trainees at the rate of some tens of people a 
year. 
  The general home-use city gas business is said to be 
generally poorer in profitability than large users. In the case 
of Gas Malaysia, the Malaysian Government is backing up city gas 
energy conversion in the nation, and it appears that 
profitability will be easy since the laying of conduits and 
piping will be borne by Petronas. 
  Since the average temperature in Malaysia is 5 to 10 degrees 
higher than in Japan, there is little demand for city gas for 
hot water supply or hot baths, but the view of Tokyo Gas is that 
"there is a latent demand for gas air conditioning, and there is 
a great possibility that the home market will be growing.

  [Text] Kansai Electric Power has completed the 
next-generation energy residence, "The Horone," and, with solar 
batteries and storage batteries installed, has begun 
corroborative testing. It is an all-electric residence designed 
with a coffee shop on the first floor and so that a family of 
four can live on the second floor, and Kansai Electric Power 
will verify efficient use of energy incorporating solar 
batteries, an electric storage and heat storage system, and a 
reverse current system. The New Energy Development Organization 
(NEDO) has been commissioned for the corroborative tests and 
will continue them for a year jointly with the Electric Power 
Central Research Institute. The first floor of the building is 
scheduled to be affranchised as a coffee shop. 
  The output of the solar batteries will be a maximum of 4 
kilowatts. All the electric power used in the daytime cannot be 
supplied by solar batteries, but it serves to reduce the peak 
load. Electricity is stored in storage batteries using 
relatively cheap late night power, hot water heat and cold heat 
are stored in a heat storage tank, and used in air conditioning 
and heating during the day. 
  This equipment is controlled by an independent energy 
management system, which forecasts power load by anticipating 
the next day's weather and family activity schedule and 
automatically selects the most appropriate use of solar 
batteries and storage batteries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment White Paper Says </F>
Business and Public Play Important Role; Urges To Take 
Initiative To Preserve Environment"] 
  [Text] Director General Hamayotsu of the Environment Agency 
(EA) submitted the "Annual Report Concerning the Status of the 
Environment (1994 Environment White Paper)" to the cabinet 
council on 31 May [1994], and it was accepted. The White Paper 
points out the importance of modifying each and every 
socioeconomic activity so that they have little destruction on 
the environment in order to build "a sustainable society" that 
can continue to develop eternally while receiving the blessings 
of the global environment. The EA is asking that private 
businesses and the public endeavor to change to environment 
preservation type activities and to switch to lifestyles that 
are environment-friendly. 
  The first white paper, based on the Basic Environment Law, 
was submitted November 1993 and was subtitled. "Toward 
Socioeconomic Activities With Little Burden on the Environment." 
The 1994 white paper emphasizes that in creating "a society 
capable of sustained development," as indicated in the Basic 
Environment Law, the roles of private business and the public 
are especially great. 
  The white paper analyzes that for private businesses, 
preservation of the environment and development of the economy 
can coexist with appropriate and aggressive investment in 
environmental activities. A shout of encouragement is being 
voiced to business to aggressively pursue enviornmental 
preservation, saying that "a new entrepreneurial spirit which 
combines the preservation of the environment and the 
continuation and development of business will activate society." 
  In terms of the public, the white paper indicates that 
business activities which are environment-friendly are aided by 
consumer behavior such as the purchase of products that consider 
the environment." The white paper calls for introducing an Edo 
Period (1600-1868) living orientation, when personal effects 
were repaired and used, in an effort to change modern lifestyles 
of mass production, mass consumption, and waste. 
  Furthermore, to aid private business and the public in 
taking 
actions regarding the environment, the white paper indicated 
support tasks that the administration should undertake: 1) 
strengthen the mechanism for accurately supplying 
environment-related information, 2) construct an economic system 
so that costs for preserving the enviornment are added to 
product prices, and 3) urge business to continue environmental 
investment regardless of good or bad economic times. 
  In addition, the white paper states that the most necessary 
thing today is the definition of a guide to ensure that 
environment preservation actions which are taken by businesses, 
the public, and the administration will produce accompanying 
results, and that the "Basic Environment Plan" currently being 
established is suitable to be this guide.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Energy Foundation and 14 </F>
Companies Conceptualize Ocean-Floating Energy Base"] 
  [Text] To float a huge solar battery with a diameter of 3 
km in the Pacific Ocean to supply energy equivalent to a large 
nuclear power plant is the concept which the New Energy 
Foundation (Toshikazu Hashimoto, chairman), an auxiliary organ 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), has 
incorporated into a project to construct an "ocean-floating 
energy base" jointly with 14 companies including construction 
companies. The power generated will be converted to hydrogen, 
transported to Japan, and used as a substitute fuel for oil and 
natural gas. The floating base can make full use of solar rays 
on the ocean, and emits zero carbon dioxide which has become the 
chief instigator of global warming. Issues for further 
examination such as construction costs remain, but the view of 
the Foundation is that "realization is possible in 2010." 
  Besides the New Energy Foundation, four general contractors 
including Obayashi-Gumi, Ltd., the Shimizu Construction Co., 
Ltd., and 10 engineering companies including Toshiba and Tokyo 
Gas are participating in the project. Because there are many 
issues concerning the preservation of the global environment and 
protection of resources related to an energy supply system that 
depends upon thermoelectric power stations and nuclear power 
generation, an ocean-floating power base as a large-scale energy 
supply source is being set forth as an alternative. 
  The man-made island will be built in the central Pacific 
Ocean at 10 to 20 degrees northern latitude and 150 to 160 
degrees eastern longitude. The project will create a circular 
"solar island" 3 km in diameter (7 square kilometers in area) by 
hooking together about 3,000 hexagonal buoys densely covered 
with solar battery panels on the surface. Because the ocean site 
is close to the equator, the sunlight is strong, and the 
efficiency of the solar batteries will be raised to a level 
which could supply Japan twice over, and the power generation 
capability will correspond to one nuclear power station at 
860,000 kilowatts. 
  Because transporting power to Japan by transmission lines is 
a disadvantage cost-wise with power loss along the way and the 
cost to lay the power transmission lines, the energy will be 
converted to hydrogen by electrolysis of water, liqueied, and 
transported to Japan by tanker. 
  A plant island (0.2 square kilometers in area) next to the 
solar island will be in charge of processsing and storing the 
hydrogen. With 50 return trips a year between it and Japan by a 
large liquid hydrogen tanker, the solar island can supply about 
200,000 cubic meters of liquid hydrogen. Converting this to 
liquid natural gas (LNG), it can supply energy equivalent to the 
volume consumed by two or three large thermoelectric power 
stations.

  [Text] Kyocera is expanding its liquid crystal display 
(LCD) business. By March 1995, it will increase production 
capability for STN (super-twisted nematic) method color LCD to 
50,000 a month (9.4 inch conversion), over three times the 
present. Color filters, which are a major product, previously 
have also only been produced for in-house use, but production 
will be increased because the supply shortage in the industry 
has become conspicuous, and it will embark on external sales. 
The total amount of facilities investment is about 3 billion yen 
for LCD and filters. Kyocera judges that high growth in the LCD 
market will continue in the future centering on personal 
computers and industrial machinery, and it will launch an 
offensive with the STN method, which is considered the company's 
forte. 
  The company currently produces 15,000 STN method color LCD's 
(9.4 inch conversion) a month and 10,000 monochrome LCD's (9.4 
inch conversion) a month at the Hayato plant (Hayato-cho, 
Kagoshima Prefecture). It will again introduce the newest 
production facilities, make an effort to improve yield, and 
increase color LCD's to 50,000 a month. Since it will maintain 
the current scale for the monochrome type, LCD's overall will 
expand from a monthly production of 25,000 to 60,000. The goal 
of sales in fiscal 1994 is 13 billion yen, 3.25 times the 
previous fiscal year. 
  The TFT (thin film transistor) method, which has the special 
features of fast response and wide visual angle, has been noted 
for color LCD. However, Kyocera judges the demand for the STN 
method to be strongly rooted and niche segregation by use is 
proceeding, and they aim for a share expansion in the method. 
They also are studying enlargement of the production line next 
fiscal year if this production increase is on track. The amount 
of facilities investment in that case is estimated to be on a 
scale of 10 billion yen. 
  Color filters are produced at the Sendai plant (Sendai, 
Kagoshima Prefecture). Currently, it supplies the total amount 
to its own company's LCD use. Beginning in March next year when 
the production increase is completed, the plan is to sell them 
outside at a pace of 15,000 a month (portion for 3,000 LCD). The 
chronic supply shortage in color filters is continuing and it 
judges that a steady demand can be anticipated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "AIST Plans Large-Scale Review of JIS </F>
Including Environment and Consumer"] 
  [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST), Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], has 
established a new long-term plan as a part of a large-scale 
review of Japan Industrial Standards (JIS) which are the 
domestic standards for mining and manufacturing industrial 
products. The existing standards, which were created from the 
viewpoint of manufacturers and suppliers, will incorporate with 
the objective of promoting products that are kind to the elderly 
and environment. The new long-term plan will be completed by the 
summer of 1995 and will be the focus of "The 8th Industrial 
Standardization Promotion Project" which will start in fiscal 
1996. 
  The Japan Industrial Standards Investigation Committee 
(JISC) 
(Kozo Iizuka, acting chairman), which is the JIS consulting 
organ, soon will set up a special subcommittee for establishment 
of the new program and begin specific deliberations. The 
subcommittee will review details of existing standards and how 
they are defined with an eye toward the arrival of an aging 
society and a growing awareness of environmental preservation 
will deliberate on the creation of domestic standards that are 
consistent with international standards, and compile proposals 
by next year. 
  Consumer goods such as daily necessities account for about 
20 
percent of JIS certified products, but many of the existing 
standards were created for quality control and to reduce costs 
on the manufacturer's side, and there often has been criticism 
that they lack consideration for consumer protection. For this 
reason, the JISC is proceeding withits review of standards by 
revising JIS definition guidelines to include considerations for 
the elderlyp.

  [Text] The Philippines and China have agreed to explore 
the possibility of undertaking joint efforts in developing the 
resources in the South China Sea, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary 
Rodolfo Severino said after the annual bilateral consultations 
between the two countries ended yesterday. However, the 
question on mineral resources in the contentious area won't be 
included in the joint efforts at the moment since it might only 
create friction between the two countries, he said. 
  The Philippines and China both lay claim to the islands in 
the South China Sea along with Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, and 
Malaysia. The islands are believed sitting atop rich resources 
of oil and minerals. They are also considered an important sea 
lane. 
  The joint efforts between Manila and Beijing are expected to 
start next year as soon as internal consultations among 
government agencies concerned begin. Mr. Severino was likewise 
informed by the Chinese delegation, headed by Assistant Foreign 
Minister Wang Yingfang, that Beijing prefers to deal with the 
South China Sea issue on a bilateral level, although they are 
also open to discussing the issue with more than two claimants. 
  On the issue of Hong Kong reverting back to China, Mr. Wang 
assured government the status of Filipino workers and local 
companies in the British colony will not be affected by the time 
the island reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. "This is in 
line with the fact that the social system will not change, even 
after the transfer of sovereignty. They don't even have 
objections to the extradition treaty we had initialed with Hong 
Kong. They said it will remain valid as long as China is 
consulted even after 1997," Mr. Severino said. 
  The two sides also discussed the need for more political 
consultations between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
and China, particularly on regional security issues. Although 
the One China Policy was tackled, Mr. Severino declined to give 
further details on what the two panels discussed. He said he 
assured Beijing that Manila will continue to adhere to the One 
China Policy.

  [Text] The government and the communist-led National 
Democratic Front (NDF) have agreed to hold the next round of 
peace talks in Europe instead of Vietnam. 
  "The NDF delegation and the (government) panel agreed to 
hold 
the next round of talks in the Benelux within the third quarter 
of this year," Howard Dee, chief government negotiator, said in 
a statement. He did not say where in the three Benelux 
territories -- Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg -- the 
meeting will take place. 
  Neither did Dee say why Vietnam was dropped as venue but 
said 
the panels thanked Hanoi for earlier agreeing to host the talks. 
  Vietnam had earlier declined a request by the NDF to act as 
third-party mediator in the peace talks. 
  The government and the NDF simultaneously released to media 
yesterday the 10 point agreement they signed during the 10 to 14 
June meeting in Breukelen, near Amsterdam. 
  The document showed that while the issues were discussed, 
they were not resolved. 
  The first seven points are NDF's requests and objections 
which the rebels said are "goodwill measures" to be voluntarily 
undertaken and are not to be taken as preconditions to the talks. 
  The joint statement signed for government by Dee and for the 
NDF by Vice Chair Luis Jalandoni said: 
  -- The NDF pressed the government to "stop its policy" of 
treating and prosecuting political offenders as common 
criminals. But the government insisted there are no political 
prisoners. 
  -- The Dee panel will convey to the president the NDF's 
request for the immediate release of political prisoners. The 
NDF will provide a list but stressed it does not mean they are 
members of the movement. 
  -- The NDF endorsed claims for indemnification of victims 
of human rights violations during the Marcos regime for at least 
30 percent of the money to be recovered from the Swiss bank 
deposits of the late strongman. 
  -- The NDF warned the government against violating the 
joint declaration signed in The Hague during exploratory talks 
in September 1992, if it will enter into peace talks with 
communist breakaway factions. 
  The government panel said it is its own prerogative and does 
not consider it a violation at all. 
  -- The NDF vigorously objected to the two amnesty 
proclamations of Mr. Ramos, saying it "impinges upon the 
organizational integrity" of the NDF. The government said 
another amnesty proclamation can be issued after the peace 
talks. Proclamations 347 and 348 were for those who have 
already surfaced, it said. 
  -- The NDF also objected to Executive Order 125 as an 
imposition on the rebels of the Constitution. The government 
refuted this, saying the order merely provides adherence to 
constitutional processes. 
  The only two points of agreement were the holding of the 
next 
round and the issuance of safety and immunity guarantees for 
negotiators, staffers, consultants and security detail during 
the talks. 
  The panels set an eight-point agenda for the next meeting, 
including the review of confidence-building measures, the 
date-and venue of the formal talks, and sequencing of the formal 
agenda to be tackled prior to the talks by reciprocal committees.

<F P=106> [By Dahlia R. Dugtong] </F>
  [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry is harping on 
a $600 to $800 million trade target this year with the People's 
Republic of China as a result of the signing of the Protocol on 
the Importation and Exportation of Commodities between the two 
countries. 
  The protocol was agreed on last week in Beijing, China 
during 
the 17th meeting of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-China 
Joint Trade Committee. 
  Trade Undersecretary Cesar Bautista also forecasts the 
narrowing of the trade deficit with China. 
  Last year, the trade deficit with China was registered at $7 
million, the lowest since 1988 when trade deficit was $175 
million. Mr. Bautista added that the country expects a balancing 
of trade with China as the latter moves towards readmission to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Under the protocol, Mr. Bautista said the following export 
products from the Philippines are expected to benefit most from 
the trade protocol: phosphatic and compound fertilizer, fresh 
bananas, chrome ore, mangoes, shelled cashew nuts, copper 
cathodes, coconut oil, tin plates, cold-rolled steel, copper 
concentrate, manganese ore, phosphoric acid, fatty acid and 
alcohol, refined glycerine, copper wire bars, rods, floppy disk 
drives, black and white picture tubes, and, processed coffee. 
  On the other hand, the Philippines will import from China 
items like soya beans, light machineries for garment 
manufacturers, power generators or mini-hydros, Mr. Bautista 
identified. 
  While the government expects a substantial increase in trade 
in China, Mr. Bautista said China's investments in the 
Philippines will still "take a backseat," primarily because of 
lack of capital. 
  The Filipino delegation that participated in the negotiation 
of the protocol included Peter Chua of the Philippine-China 
Trade Council, Victoriano Lecaros of the Philippine Embassy in 
Beijing, and officials from the Department of Trade and Industry.

  [Text] Cuba's ambassador to the Philippines, Jose Luis 
Martin Portal, had been found dead at his Manila home, 
apparently from cardiac arrest. He was 49. 
  The Philippines' Foreign Office said Portal's body was found 
on Sunday evening [19 June] by his household staff, who called 
the police. Portal's wife and children were in Havana, and the 
envoy was living alone in the exclusive North Forbes Park 
district in Metro Manila. Police said they found no sign of 
foul play. 
  Portal assumed his Manila post in October 1990.

  [Text] Answering a VNA correspondent's question on the 
outcome of the recent visit to the Russian Federation, Ukraine, 
and Kazakhstan by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his Vietnamese 
Government delegation, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: 
  It should be pointed out first that Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet's visit was a fine success. Various documents were signed 
laying down the principles for relations between Vietnam and 
each of these countries in the new era. In the Ukraine, the two 
sides signed a treaty on the fundamental principles for 
relations between Vietnam and Ukraine. In Russia, the two prime 
ministers signed a treaty on the fundamental principles for 
friendly relations between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and 
the Russian Federation. In Kazakhstan, although no treaty was 
signed, the two prime ministers issued a joint statement laying 
down various principles for relations between Vietnam and 
Kazakhstan. Apart from holding discussions and signing various 
documents, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet exchanged views with the 
leaders of these countries and achieved a strong consensus on 
guidelines for broadening relations between Vietnam and each of 
these countries. 
  It should be further noted that all three countries Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet visited highly appreciated Vietnam's 
heartfelt sentiments stemming from the age-old friendship dating 
back to the time of the former Soviet Union. They expressed 
their hope that the two sides will jointly contribute to 
consolidating this friendship and use it as a basis for mutually 
beneficial cooperation both now and in the long term. 
  As for the two issues that are receiving public attention -- 
namely the liquidation of Vietnamese debts and the presence of 
the Vietnamese community in the Russian Federation -- Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: 
  With regard to the debt issue, our prime minister exchanged 
views on this issue with the leaders of the Russian Federation 
and an agreement was reached with the Russian Government to 
consider rescheduling Vietnamese debts. The Russian Federation 
Government will have its responsible agencies look into this 
issue. Regarding the issue of the Vietnamese community in the 
Russian Federation, we unanimously agreed with our friends that 
their responsible agencies should exchange views and come up 
with appropriate measures to settle this issue in conformity 
with the friendly relations between the two countries.

  [Text] At a news conference on the national financial 
situation in the first six months of the year, Ministry of 
Finance representative revealed that the budget's revenue 
collection is so far progressing on schedule, but that the 
sources to subsidize the deficit are still limited. 
  Domestic savings are insignificant and foreign funds are not 
yet available. This limits spending to urgent and regular items 
and debt repayment only, while spending on capital construction 
has been low. By 10 April, the funds actually allocated for 
capital construction projects reached only 21.4 percent of the 
planned targets, with tardiness being the result of difficulties 
in with income sources. 
  Many projects are also suffering from a cessation of funds 
as 
they cannot meet fund allocation requirements. Of the 5,460 
investment projects this year, about three-quarters of them have 
not been able to fulfill requirements for capital allocation. 
Altogether, they represent six trillion dong in capitalization, 
and are mostly for projects initiated by the ministries of 
transportation, water conservancy, energy, culture and 
information, and banks.

  [Text] According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Industry, provinces in northern region have completed their 
harvest on over one million hectares of fifth-month spring rice. 
Except for the provinces of Thua Thien-Hue and Quang Tri which 
have suffered from a bad harvest of about 12-13 tonnes per 
hectare and a gross collection of 80,000 tonnes of grain, Ha 
Tinh and Nghe An have reaped an increase of 40,000 tonnes. All 
other provinces enjoy larger or equal harvests in comparison 
with last spring rice planting season. 
  According to local agriculture offices, the total grain 
output of northern provinces this year is about 4.220 million 
tonnes, or nearly the same as last year's spring rice season of 
4.223 million tonnes. 
  Provinces in northern region also produced about 1.2 million 
tonnes of other crops, thus bringing the total agricultural 
output of +another good harvest this year to 5.4 million tonnes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Expanding Military Pressure"] </F>
  [Text] Dangerous military moves aggravating the situation 
on the Korean peninsula are being witnessed continually. 
According to a report, a strike group of the United States, 
Japan, and South Korea has been organized in the process of the 
Rimpac-94 joint military exercise conducted off Hawaii. The 
report says that the strike group is composed of the combat 
ships and planes of the United States, Japan, and South Korea, 
with the aircraft carriers Independence and Constellation 
forming the basis of it, its mission being the battle against a 
hypothetical enemy. 
  As has been reported, they raved, even before the Rimpac-94 
joint military exercise began, that the exercise would serve as 
a message to North Korea. Moreover, it is a public fact that 
the United States, Japan, and South Korea became even stronger 
allies during the exercise. In view of this, the hypothetical 
enemy they designated is undoubtedly our Republic. This shows 
that the strike group has been organized for the purpose of a 
preemptive attack on our country, thus clearly showing how 
frenziedly the U.S. imperialists, the Japanese reactionaries, 
and the South Korean puppets are maneuvering to crush [apsal] 
our Republic. 
  The world publicly admits that we are not developing nuclear 
weapons. It was the United States that gave birth to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is also the United 
States that is increasing the danger of nuclear war. The U.S. 
imperialists are threatening us with the 1,000-odd nuclear 
weapons deployed in South Korea, and the Japanese reactionaries 
and the South Korean puppets are growing their own nuclear 
mushroom under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. 
  Nevertheless, like a thief turning on the owner, they who 
are 
posing a nuclear threat, went so far as to form a strike group 
aimed at attacking us militarily, going further in harassing 
us--who do not have nuclear weapons and who are under the 
nuclear threat--with a nuclear issue. Furthermore, not to be 
overlooked is the fact that the strike group was formed when the 
situation on the Korean peninsula was extremely aggravated and 
entered a dangerous phase of war. 
  Now the United States has massively assembled its aggressive 
forces, including aircraft carriers, in South Korea and its 
surrounding areas to crush our Republic under the pretext of the 
so-called nuclear issue. Raving about a preemptive strike on 
us, the United States is aiming at an opportunity to provoke a 
war. The Japanese reactionaries are also attempting to take the 
lead in taking sanctions against us. 
  The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique, raving about the 
inevitability of sanctions against us, is persistently 
maneuvering, in collusion with outside forces, to harm its 
fellow countrymen and to drive the nation into a nuclear 
calamity. 
  It is far from an unpremeditated development that the United 
States, Japan, and South Korea organized a strike group at a 
time when a grave explosive situation is being created on the 
Korean peninsula because of the said maneuvers. It is an 
advance preparation for the formation of multinational forces 
to be put into a war of northward invasion on the Korean 
peninsula when those countries provoke it. In other words, it 
can be said to be a trial formation of a multinational force. 
  With the organization of the strike group, they are 
attempting to further expand and intensify their military threat 
against us and force us to submit. This is proven by the 
foreign press report on the organization of the strike group, 
which said it is a political warning for Pyongyang. 
  They, however, are miscalculating. Our people are never 
frightened nor do they submit, no matter what pressure is put on 
them. We have already made it clear that a sanction is a 
declaration of war against us, and that not only those 
participating in a sanction but those supporting it will be duly 
held responsible for it. We mean what we say. 
  Our people treasure peace, but do not beg for peace by 
having 
the country's sovereignty trampled upon. We will inflict a 
resolute punishment on those who set upon us to crush our 
socialism.

  [Text] According to reports, the United States and Japan 
are strengthening their conspiracy and collusion [kongmo 
kyoltak] in preparation for an emergency [yusasie taebihayo] on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  According to Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN dated 18 June, the U.S. 
Government recently asked Japan to transport Americans along 
with Japanese in South Korea when Japan withdraws its people 
from South Korea in preparation for an acute situation 
[kinbakhan satae] on the Korean peninsula. 
  Accordingly, the Japanese Government is making every effort 
for an early passage of the revised Self-Defense Forces [SDF] 
Law draft that enables Japan to dispatch SDF planes to South 
Korea. On the other hand, it has begun to consider using 
warships, which are capable of transporting more people than 
airplanes, in case of emergency. 
  The revised SDF Law draft aimed at dispatching SDF planes to 
South Korea is reportedly being deliberated by the Special 
Security Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives. 
This hints that the U.S. anti-Republic crushing maneuver has 
reached a very dangerous stage [migugui pan konghwaguk apsal 
chaektongi maeu wihomhan tangye-e irugo ittanun kosul sisa 
haejunun hanpyon], as well as showing that the Japanese 
reactionaries' ambition to invade Korea again and their maneuver 
to dispatch their troops overseas have reached an extreme level 
[kukto-e tarhago ittanun kosul]. 
  The United States is trying to use military planes and 
warships of the SDF in carrying out a war against the Republic 
under the pretext of withdrawing foreigners form South Korea. 
The Japanese reactionaries backed by the United States [migugul 
tungdaego] are attempting to mobilize SDF troops for a war of 
invading Korea [choson chimnyak chonjaeng] and to legally 
dispatch them overseas by revising the SDF Law, under the cloak 
of transporting foreigners. 
  The conspiracy and collusion of the United States and Japan 
aimed at the Korean peninsula is arousing concerns of world 
public opinion for its dangerousness [ku wihomsonguro hayo].

<F P=106> ["Sophism of Hypocrite" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign 
Minister, Koji Kakizawa, claimed that Japan must be a permanent 
member of the United Nations Security Council with veto power 
and if it got a permanent seat, it would be active to "reflect 
the view of the Asian region and small nations." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today views his remarks as 
a sophism of a hypocrite and an obtrusive rigmarole looking down 
upon Asian countries and small nations. 
  The analyst says: 
  His remarks that Japan will represent the view of the Asian 
region means that it wants to become "the leader" of Asia. Down 
through history, Japan has regarded Asia as the target of its 
aggression and looting. It has considered it to be natural. 
Such a thinking-pattern has been inherited by the present 
Japanese Government authorities. 
  In actuality, Japan is seeking the repetition of its past 
policy of aggression. This is well illustrated by the Japanese 
Government's position on the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula. Japan is watching for a chance of reinvasion, while 
going ahead with the preparation of "emergency security 
legislative arrangements" aimed at sending its Armed Forces to 
the Korean peninsula under the pretext of "countering the 
fictitious nuclear issue" of the DPRK. Japan's military 
aggression on Korea will be the first step toward its comeback 
to Asia for realising its old dream of "the greater East Asia 
coprosperity sphere." 
  How can such a country represent the will of the Asian 
countries? Japan's expression of wish to represent the Asian 
nations is an insult to the Asian nations and people. 
  The Japanese Government expressed the view that "the use of 
nuclear weapons is not contrary to the international law," 
openly favoring the use of nuclear weapons. This indicates that 
Japan will make no scruple of plunging developing and small 
nations into a nuclear holocaust to dominate and plunder them. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must give up their impudent 
ambition and honestly liquidate its past crimes first of all.

<F P=106> ["Confession of Nuclear Criminal" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata told reporters at the Diet on June 17 that "Japan 
surely has the capacity to possess nuclear weapons," a report 
from Tokyo says. 
  In this connection, the chief secretary of the cabinet, 
Kumagai, revised the remarks of Hata at a press conference in 
the evening, saying that "the prime minister did not use a 
proper expression." 
  Upset by the reaction within the government, Hata hurriedly 
called reporters together that evening and "withdrew" his 
remarks, saying "Did I say so really? I do not remember that." 
  Although Hata cancelled his remarks, he cannot conceal the 
nuclear design of Japan he had revealed of his own accord. 
  His remarks that Japan has the capacity to possess nuclear 
weapons were a confession of the nuclear ambition of Japan and 
admission of the moves to convert Japan into a nuclear power, 
the moves which have gone beyond the danger line. 
  In fact, the world knows Japan is capable of possessing 
nuclear weapons. Japan, however, had categorically denied it 
till Hata admitted it. 
  As a result, Japan's veil of "three non-nuclear principles" 
has been thrown off, and it has been made crystal clear that 
the Japanese Government's argument that "Japan's use of atomic 
energy is limited to peaceful purposes" is a sheer lie to 
mislead public opinion. 
  It is disgusting that this nuclear criminal is zealously 
conducting the anti-DPRK campaign in conspiracy with 
international reactionaries, raising a hue and cry over the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK which has neither the will nor the 
capacity to develop nuclear weapons. 
  Japan must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful that its 
moves to become a nuclear power will bring nothing good to it 
and will cause irrevocable catastrophic consequences.

National Defense minister, which is on an official visit to the 
DPRK.

The president thanked Senior General Doan Khue for the fine

the people and the People's Army of the DPRK, and hoped the 
visit would contribute to promoting the friendly ties between 
the two armies and peoples.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song gave on-the-spot guidance to the Kumdang 
Cooperative Farm in Onchon County, South Pyongan Province, on 
June 19. 
  He was accompanied by So Yun-sok, chief secretary of the 
South Pyongan Provincial Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea [WPK] and chairman of the South Pyongan Provincial 
People's Committee, So Kwan-hi, secretary of the WPK Central 
Committee, Kim Won-chin, chairman of the State Agricultural 
Commission, Kim Nak-hui, chairman of the South Pyongan 
Provincial Rural Economy Committee, and other officials 
concerned. 
  The cooperative farmers of Kumdang reaped a high yield of 
grain last year by strictly applying the chuche farming method 
of the WPK, and they have become able to look ahead to a rich 
harvest this year through vigorous efforts to increase the grain 
output. 
  President Kim Il-song got first-hand knowledge of crop 
conditions, going round the fields of the farm and noted with 
deep satisfaction that the agricultural working people of the 
Kumdang Cooperative Farm had created good crop conditions by 
concentrating every effort on farming in hearty response to the 
party's agriculture-first policy. To do a successful farming 
is most important in resolving the problems of food, clothing 
and housing, he said, adding that the agricultural working 
people must do all farm work on a scientific and technical basis 
as required by the chuche method of farming, deeply conscious 
that they are responsible for the rice granaries of the nation. 
He said various kinds of fertilizers must be applied to crops 
in a rational ratio in order to increase the grain output. 
  He praised the Kumdang Cooperative Farm for effectively 
irrigating nonpaddy fields with the introduction of various 
economic and rational methods of irrigation. All the 
cooperative farms must mobilize all the irrigation facilities to 
supply enough water to maize and other crops, he added. 
  He said that in order to increase agricultural production, 
the leading officials of agriculture must enhance their role and 
the industrial sector must supply larger quantities of farming 
materials to the countryside.

  [Text] Sydney, June 21 (AFP) -- Australian security 
services are investigating the circumstances in which two 
alleged Afghan war criminals have taken refuge here, Foreign 
Minister Gareth Evans said Tuesday. 
  But the minister denied a claim that any deal was done by 
which the men -- said to be former high-ranking members of 
Afghan communist leader Najibollah's regime -- were granted 
entry in exchange for giving information to the security 
services. 
  The Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC) claimed in a report 
Monday that at least three members of the regime responsible for 
many atrocities had been given permanent residence in Australia. 
  The regime's former vice president and a deputy secret 
service chief were said to be among the war criminals. 
  Members of Australia's Afghan community were threatening to 
take action against them unless the government responded, the 
ABC said. 
  Opposition Senator David MacGibbon asked in a parliamentary 
question Tuesday if it was true the men had gained entry despite 
a warning from members of the Afghan community to former 
Immigration Minister Robert Ray in May 1989. 
  MacGibbon described them as being former members of a regime 
said to have executed one and a half million of its citizens 
during Afghanistan's civil war. 
  Evans said he took the view that no Australian security 
agency ever had or ever would knowingly assist the entry of any 
individual who had been involved in terrorist activities or war 
crimes. 
  "I am certainly not aware of any deal whatsoever being made 
with anybody on this matter," he told the Senate. 
  Evans said the allegations were known to the Australian 
security authorities and were being investigated although the 
government was not yet fully apprised of the status and other 
relevant details of the persons in question. 
  The identity of two had been established but nothing was 
known of the third. 
  Evans said the immigration department was considering an 
application for refugee status from one and the second had 
resident status, having entered under the humanitarian program. 
  His visa was issued in New Delhi, India after all normal 
requirements had been assessed as met, Evans said. 
  But the minister declined to elaborate on MacGibbon's 
suggestion of security service involvement, saying it was 
long-standing government policy not to comment on security 
matters.

  [Text] Sydney, June 16 (AFP) -- The Australian government 
has summoned Chinese Ambassador Shi Chunlai to protest his 
country's June 10 nuclear test blast, officials said Thursday. 
  "Senior department officials protested to him about the test 
yesterday (Wednesday) and reiterated our view that it was deeply 
disappointing," said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade in Canberra. 
  China carried out the underground blast, which had a 
strength 
of 10 to 40 kilotonnes of TNT according Australian scientists, 
at its Lobnor test site on Friday.

  [Text] Fiji's opposition leader, Jai Ram Reddy of the 
National Federation Party [NFP], will consider whether to 
withdraw from parliament following Prime Minister Sitiveni 
Rabuka's warning that there could be another coup. The NFP and 
its ally, the Fiji Labor Party [FLP], are maintaining they 
boycotted parliament after walking out yesterday in protest at 
Mr. Rabuka's remarks during a law and order debate. Mr. Rabuka, 
who led the army overthrow of the Timoci Bavandra government in 
1987, warned that there could be a third and possibly bloody 
coup if indigenous Fijians continue to feel disadvantaged. 
  The NFP has accused the prime minister of trying to 
intimidate Fiji Indians, who comprise about 45 percent of the 
population, and they are denied equal political rights under the 
1990 Constitution. Jai Ram Reddy, who head the NFP, was 
questioned whether Indian political parties have a role to play 
in parliament in view of the fact that they were barred from 
government and were criticized for performing as an opposition. 
Mr. Reddy said the NFP would consider during the weekend 
whether to continue in parliament and possibly have talks with 
the FLP. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Rabuka today sought to play down his remarks 
telling a half-empty parliament that he was not attacking any 
community in particular and that he was not saying he would 
stage another coup. However, he repeated that no one could 
guarantee what might happen in the future.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Written Interview With ROK President Kim </F>
Yong-sam by POST editor Phaisan Sicharatchanya last week ahead 
of Thai Prime Minister's Chuan Likphai Visit 23 Jun] 
  [Text] Q: What specific issues of bilateral significance 
will you raise for discussion with Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai during his forthcoming visit to Seoul? 
  A: I will discuss with Prime Minister Chuan ways of 
deepening 
the ties of friendship and cooperation between the Republic of 
Korea and Thailand and of promoting share prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  First of all, we will focus our attention on how our two 
countries should pull together to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue, which is threatening the security of not only 
this region but also of the entire world. We will also conduct 
in depth discussions on ways to boost substantive bilateral 
economic cooperation, especially by expanding the flow of trade, 
investment and people between our two countries. Views will 
also be exchanged on how to strengthen Asia-Pacific regional 
cooperation, primarily through the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum. 
  Q: Where does Thailand stand in South Korea's conduct of 
foreign affairs and international economic relations? How do 
you envisage bilateral Korean-Thai relations to develop from now? 
  A: As part of its New Foreign Policy, our Government is 
attaching great importance to Southeast Asia. As a key member 
of ASEAN Thailand is playing a major regional role. I applaud 
your countries for taking the initiative in creating the ASEAN 
Free Trade Area (AFTA) and for having striven so hard to promote 
stability on Indochina. 
  Later this year, in its capacity as the chairman of ASEAN, 
Thailand will host the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional 
Forum, at which a multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific security 
will be conducted for the first time. I am hopeful that this 
forum will greatly contribute to peace and security in this 
region. 
  My view is that our two countries will be able to further 
expand mutual ties, especially by more actively conducting 
bilateral and multilateral efforts to promote regional 
prosperity and security. In view of the fact that Thailand, 
which occupies an important position in the ASEAN and 
Indochinese economy, is continuing to grow rapidly, I believe 
the importance of your country as a diplomatic and economic 
partner for us is increasing faster than ever. 
  Just as Korea is located at the centre of Northeast Asia, so 
is Thailand serving as a bridge between ASEAN and Indochina. 
Accordingly, I think Thailand is an important base for Korean 
businesses venturing into Indochina and Myanmar (Burma). 
  It is true that nowadays, our two countries are competing 
against each other on the international market in a limited 
range of products like garments and footwear. My view is, 
however, that there is a great potential for complementary and 
mutually advantageous economic interaction between our two 
countries in many areas. 
  [Text] Furthermore, since both Korea and Thailand have 
sustained a high growth rate on the strength of outward-looking 
development strategies and the industriousness of their peoples, 
I believe that our two countries are in a unique position to 
lead economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. I hope and 
expect that building on its long-standing, open-door policy for 
all regardless of ideological differences Thailand will be able 
to significantly contribute not only to the stability of the 
Korean Peninsula but also to the stability and prosperity of 
Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region in general. 
  Q: How do you envisage South Korea's economic relations with 
ASEAN and Indochina to develop taking into account your 
country's close economic ties with neighbouring countries in 
Northeast Asia? 
  A: In the wake of the end of the Cold War, China and Vietnam 
-- the major Asian socialist countries -- are rapidly emerging 
as major markets for the Republic of Korea (ROK). Korean 
businesses are briskly moving into those lands to combine their 
technology and capital with the abundant human and natural 
resources there in a complementary and mutually beneficial 
fashion. 
  My view is that the business climate is also greatly 
improving in the ASEAN countries as they continue to achieve 
rapid growth, thus joining the ranks of the newly-industrialised 
economies. They are also opening their markets ever wider and 
intensively investing in social infrastructure. Consequently, 
there now are emerging greater opportunities for the Republic of 
Korea and ASEAN to develop complementary economic ties, 
especially by sharing their accumulated developmental expertise 
and information. 
  In particular, I believe it advisable for the ROK and 
Thailand and other ASEAN to enter joint ventures in Vietnam and 
neighbouring Indochinese countries, now that their relations 
with the United States are improving and they are emerging as 
attractive targets for foreign investment. 
  To further expand ROK-ASEAN economic cooperation, I think it 
is necessary that the emerging and contemplated sub-regional 
groupings, such as AFTA and EAEC (the East Asian Economic 
Caucus), be open economic communities, rather than closed 
trading blocs. 
  Q: What specific policies does South Korea intended to adopt 
vis-a-vis Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos)? Does your 
government intend to pursue such policies by going it alone or 
in partnership with any country in ASEAN? 
  A: Korea normalised diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 
December 1992, and will do so with Cambodia and Laos in due 
course. Presently, we are contributing to the efforts of Vietnam 
to rebuild its economy. We hope that we will be able to promote 
economic exchanges and visits with Cambodia and Laos even prior 
to the normalisation of diplomatic relations. We know that our 
policies toward these countries are in line with the efforts of 
ASEAN to promote the peace, stability and prosperity of the 
nations in the region. 
  Q: Does your government have any clear-cut policy on helping 
to bring about positive political and economic changes in Burma? 
  A: We are very interested in the development of Myanmar and 
hope that it will be able to smoothly achieve democratisation as 
well as economic development. It was in this context that our 
Government welcomed the Myanmar Government announcement in April 
1992 of the release of political prisoners along with a 
timetable for democratisation. 
  The Korean Government has, in fact, been positively 
considering offering Myanmar assistance from the Economic 
Development Cooperation Fund to help promote its economic 
well-being. We also plan to study ways to cooperate with other 
ASEAN nations in supporting the democratic development and 
economic reforms of Myanmar. 
  Q: What does South Korea hope to achieve from its 
participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum? 
  A: We hope and expect that the forum will gradually build a 
security regime in the Asia-Pacific region. As the forum is 
comprised of nations that have had hostile relations in the 
past, we believe that it should gradually build a climate of 
mutual trust through free discussion of issues of mutual concern 
including politics and regional security, rather than attempting 
to resolve all pending issues en bloc. 
  We understand that the forum's initial conference will be 
held in July with the participation of the foreign ministers of 
18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We believe that that 
meeting will be very significant as it reflects a common concern 
about regional security and cooperation. 
  Q: What role does South Korea expect Japan to play in the 
broader framework of regional security in the Asia-Pacific 
region? Should Japan assume a bigger security role in areas 
such as regional and international peacekeeping? 
  A: Now that the Cold War era is over, Japan will be able to 
play a strengthened role commensurate with its economic power, 
and increase its responsibility for the peace and prosperity of 
the region. However, it should not be overlooked that the 
unfortunate experience which the nations in the region suffered 
in the past has caused Japan's neighbors to be wary about its 
emergence as a major military power in the region. Therefore, 
Japan should spare no effort to remove such anxiety. 
  Q: What specific measures do you propose to resolve the 
confrontation on the Korean Peninsula? And how do you propose 
to go about implementing these measures? 
  A: Due to increasing doubts about North Korea's nuclear 
development and its withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), tension has been mounting, not only 
between South and North Korea but in the international 
community, which is seeking sanctions against North Korea. 
  There will be no easing of tension between the South and the 
North as long as North Korea refuses to return to the IAEA and 
settle the nuclear issue. However, if the North Korean nuclear 
issue is resolved, it will be possible to promote mutual 
prosperity by implementing the various South-North accords 
worked out in the past. We are ready to substantially implement 
all the accords by activating all those South-North joint 
organisations already established or to be established by 
agreement.

  [Text] Police have arrested a Pakistani and are hunting 
another on suspicion that they were involved in a plot to harm 
the Nepalese Crown Prince at the Asian Institute of Technology 
(AIT) in Pathum Thani on Sunday evening [19 June]. 
  Crown Prince Dipendra Bin Brikram Shadey, 22, arrived in 
Thailand on Sunday to attend a four-day geography course until 
June 23 at the AIT before beginning his official visit from June 
24-27. 
  The two suspects, identified as Mohamad Javet and Shakil 
Ammad, on Sunday allegedly hired a passenger pick-up truck to 
the AIT where they told the reception office they were the 
prince's guests. 
  Security officers asked the suspects to show their 
passports. 
Javet claimed he did not have it with him and left in a car 
parked nearby purportedly to get his passport. 
  The security officers became suspicious and contacted Khlong 
Luang District police to come and arrest the remaining suspect, 
Shakil Ammad. 
  Ammad was taken for questioning at the district police 
station. 
  Ammad claimed to be an engineer with a well-known 
construction company. But the company when contacted by police 
investigators, denied the suspect's name was on its list of 
employees. 
  Ammad was intensively interrogated throughout yesterday 
after 
the Police Department ordered Khlong Luang police to urgently 
investigate the case. 
  Police manning checkpoints have been ordered to be on the 
alert to prevent the other suspect still at large from fleeing. 
  Police said they had "hard evidence" to support their belief 
that the two suspects were involved in a plot to harm the 
Nepalese Crown Prince. 
  According to police information, Javet had been in Thailand 
for several days while Ammad arrived in Bangkok on Saturday.

  [Text] Thailand yesterday suggested the Cambodian 
government and the Khmer Rouge try to agree on the agenda before 
starting peace negotiations to ensure progress. 
  "It is better than talking about the issues which each side 
cannot accept. 
  "Otherwise, there would be no breakthrough," Foreign 
Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri said when asked to comment on the failure of the 
round-table discussions in Phnom Penh on Thursday. 
  The second round of talks, which resumed on Wednesday 
following the one hosted by King Norodom Sihanouk in Pyongyang 
last month, was a deadlock as both sides could not agree on the 
agendas. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong reiterated that the peace 
negotiation could not be successfully concluded in just one 
meeting and encouraged the Cambodian leaders and the Khmer Rouge 
representatives to find opportunities for more talks.

<F P=106> [Report by Brian Hansford] </F>
  [Text] Sitting down together rather than shooting one 
another is the main achievement of Cambodia's coalition 
politicians, according to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
  "Parties have turned from confrontation to cooperation, 
politically and militarily, in the months of the coalition 
government. This is the biggest favourable point in the last 20 
years," Hun Sen told Inside Indochina. 
  The interview took place before Interior Minister Yu Hokkri 
ordered the closure of the Khmer Rouge [KR] office in Phnom 
Penh, citing the failure of peace talks. 
  Hun Sen denies that dialogue is superficial. He acknowledges 
there are disputes at lower levels of Phnom Penh's 
administration, but says they are not necessarily political 
disagreements between the main coalition partners of FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and 
Cooperative Cambodia] and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP]. 
  "Cooperation between Prince Ranariddh and me is good. We 
seem to be coming from one party," said the CPP's top man in 
government. 
  "I do not mean all our officials have such good cooperation 
but differences between officials do not require many parties. 
I used to lead a government with one party and used to 
experience differences between provincial governors and deputy 
governors or ministers and deputy ministers who come from only 
one party." 
  Hun Sen made clear that he believes the country's main 
problem is the Khmer Rouge rather than coalition politics. 
  "I am fed up with this matter (of outlawing the guerrillas) 
because in such a state of hesitancy it's difficult for me to 
work," said Hun Sen repeating his wish to outlaw the Khmer Rouge 
during the next session of Cambodia's parliament. 
  Cambodia's "second problem" is economic development although 
the stable Cambodian currency, the riel, in recent months shows 
people's increased confidence in the government's economic 
measures, according to Hun Sen. However, Phnom Penh officials 
say the Cambodian premier has much less confidence in the 
country's finance minister, Sam Rangsi. 
  Officials say Hun Sen has spoken of Rangsi's trying to set 
up 
Western economic systems too quickly for Cambodia, despite the 
fact the finance ministry has support from world financial 
bodies including loans from the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF). 
  "The third problem relates to restructuring our 
administration. Cambodia's civil and military administration are 
combined from three factions. That's why the number of civilian 
and military (personnel) today is more than our finance can 
support. 
  "Before the same source of income was used to feed the 
people 
of the State of Cambodia (the pre-election government) but now 
the same source has to feed other people from other factions," 
Hun Sen said, explaining the chronic overstaffing of government 
offices. 
  But last year's election results and the resulting coalition 
government with three main parties and their extra personnel is 
only a partial explanation for the government's overstaffing, 
according to independent experts. 
  "This holds true to a large extent on the military and 
police 
sides with the merging of the FUNCINPEC and BLDP [Buddhist 
Liberal Democratic Party] forces with those of the pre-election 
government, but the civil administration was already way 
overmanned," a Phnom Penh-based diplomat said. 
  More than two years ago a World Bank study noted: "The size 
of the administration is larger than public management norms 
recommend and creates problems of duplication and its root cause 
of overstaffing." 
  Regular Cambodian government troops are estimated at 160,000 
with a similar number of civil servants. These are figures 
which some experts say are around 10 times and twice as much, 
respectively, as appropriate for cash-strapped Cambodia. 
  Independent explanations for such chronic overmanning focus 
on reasons of political patronage and corruption but, whatever 
the cause, Hun Sen admits such overmanning breeds inefficiency 
and corruption which in turn deters potential investors. 
  "We have to do our best so investors can be confident, to 
secure stability for investment and put in practice the new code 
of investment, decrease tax and to cut short the paperwork. We 
have to get ride of corruption," Hun Sen said. 
  His ideal is that foreign investment will create jobs and 
attract people from the state sector. This will allow better 
pay for the remaining government employees, reducing corruption. 
  Numerous Cambodian businessmen and officials, as well as 
expatriates, have stressed the importance of dialogue among 
Cambodia's coalition leaders. Despite encouraging words from 
some officials the reality is bleak. 
  A more worrying aspect is the image of apparent government 
impotence or at worst a lack of interest in the face of the 
overstaffed, inefficient state apparatus. 
  "The danger of not tackling these issues is that you give 
the 
impression there is no political will or that people don't 
recognise the problems. That sends a very bad signal not only 
to the international community -- private sector and donor -- 
but also to the population," said an experienced international 
aid official working in Cambodia. 
  As Hun Sen said: "Right or wrong is one thing but the 
important thing is to correct our mistakes."

  [Text] Cambodia is a safe and viable area for investment, 
and is looking to play a part within Asean in the economic life 
of Southeast Asia, Om Rasadi, chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the Cambodian Parliament said. 
  At a conference organized last week by Chulalongkon 
University and attended by top officials from the Thai Foreign 
Office and National Security Council, Om and his deputy, Un 
Noeng, discussed Cambodia's position in the region a year after 
the May 1993 elections. 
  Om represents the royalist Funcinpec [National United Front 
for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] 
party of King Norodom Sihanouk. Noeng is a member of the 
opposition Cambodian People's Party of Hun Sen. They represent 
the two largest parties in the new national parliament created 
when the new constitution was ratified last September. 
  Om was more confident about the future than recent press 
reports on the Cambodian situation have suggested. "I would 
prefer to say that we have challenges in Cambodia and not 
problems", he said. He went on to outline the need for economic 
stability.and growth, long term economic management, and the 
encouragement of private enterprise. 
  Despite being on opposite sides of the political divide, 
both 
men were united in the desire to encourage direct foreign 
investment in their country. They stressed that Parliament was 
working on the National Plan for Reconstruction and Development 
which has the support of the United Nations Development 
Programme. 
  Both men denied that the continued hostilities between the 
Phnom Penh government and the Khmer Rouge were an obstacle to 
investment, and Om invited the international community to visit 
Cambodia "in order to see for themselves". 
  Noeng claimed the Khmer Rouge controlled only 5-10 percent 
of 
Cambodian territory, and that moves were underway to merge and 
reform the security forces of the major factions. 
  "If one has been ill for 20 years, one cannot be cured in 
one 
hour, but the patient is able to tell you that the medicine is 
working," said Om. 
  Using the rhetoric of `national reconciliation', a veiled 
metaphor usually understood to mean inclusion of the Khmer Rouge 
in the governing process, both parliamentarians claimed that 
with the development of a human rights policy and with 
sustainable economic growth, the Khmer Rouge problem could be 
solved through integration rather than suppression . 
  This position directly contradicts a motion currently tabled 
by MPs seeking to outlaw and condemn the Khmer Rouge and follows 
the policy of reconciliation inconsistently promoted by King 
Sihanouk over recent years. 
  The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee also hinted 
that Cambodia may in the future play a more involved role in 
regional economic development, in addition to be coming a member 
of the Asean Parliamentary Union and acting as an observer at 
full Asean meetings. 
  "It takes time to be member of these important 
organisations, 
but I say to you also that Cambodia will play real role not only 
in the development but also in the security of the region," said 
Om. 
  Co-operation with Thailand was also seen as crucial to 
Cambodia's future, and Om brushed aside rumours of link between 
the Thai Army and the Khmer Rouge. The other nations of 
Southeast Asia were requested to help with technological change 
such as skill training and education. 
  Om concluded by expressing the wish that Cambodia an the 
Asean nations could "try to have a common interest for the next 
century, for the year 2000."

  [Text] Kota Bahru, Kelantan -- Restoran Syam is a 
well-known Muslim restaurant which has for long been a favorite 
hangout for local Malaysian politicians, runaway separatists and 
bandits from southern Thailand. 
  As such, Thai and Malaysian undercover officers often rub 
shoulders during their forays to the restaurant as they seek to 
eavesdrop on conversations or pick up any other information that 
can come their way from the slip of the tongue of its patrons. 
  The biggest restaurant in the so-called Sibsong Hong area, 
it 
is owned and operated by Abdullah Sulaiman, alias Sum, 50, a 
native of Pattani province who is, by bloodline, a nephew of the 
late Haji Sulong Tomina, who was charged with treason in 1948. 
  He is also a cousin of alleged separatist leader Haji Amin 
Tomina. 
  Because of his relationship with separatist leaders, it came 
as no surprise that Sum was accused by the Thai authorities of 
being a member of the separatist movement. 
  Malaysian security officials suspect him to be a spy for 
Thailand. 
  "I admit that members of several movements have approached 
me 
and sought my cooperation, some even asking me to join them. But 
I have always turned them down," said Mr. Sum. 
  He said he has often been blackmailed and on several 
occasions questioned by Malaysian special branch police. 
  "Neither the separatists, the Malaysian nor Thai authorities 
trust me," he complained bitterly. 
  "Everybody identifies this restaurant with his movement. Be 
it the PULO (Pattani United Liberation Organisation), or BRN 
(Barisan Revolusi Nationale), or UMNO (the Malaysian ruling 
party) or the PASS," said Mr Sum cynically. 
  He said his restaurant was under suspicion by all sides 
because it welcomed all parties regardless of their affiliation 
or background. 
  "If you ask me if I ever met Haji Amin, I would say yes 
because he is my cousin. If I talked with Haji Amin, you would 
suspect that we might have discussed politics. 
  "People like to sum up things the easy way. Sometimes, the 
information obtained by Thai authorities is not double or 
cross-checked. That's where the fault lies," said Mr Sum. 
  Sibsong Hong was previously off-limits to outsiders because 
it was the meeting ground for runaway PULO separatists from 
southern Thailand. 
  Mr. Sum admitted that when he first set up the restaurant 20 
years ago life was difficult. 
  But now the situation has substantially improved with most 
of 
the separatists and bandits gone. 
  He said he believed most leading separatists had defected to 
Thai authorities, leaving behind only ordinary criminals. 
  He ruled out the suggestion that some Middle Eastern 
countries had secretly funded separatist movements in southern 
Thailand. 
  "The Arabs have their own problems. The Muslim world has 
problems. Even the conflict in Bosnia remains unresolved," he 
said, adding that he didn't think the Arabs had any interest in 
the people of Pattani. 
  While insisting his non-involvement with any political 
groups 
or bandit gangs, Sulaiman admitted that he dare not return to 
his hometown in Pattani after the arson attacks on several 
schools in southern provinces last August. 
  He cited the arrest of Toh Kuheng as the arson suspect, 
saying Kuheng was just a restaurant employee, a scapegoat. 
  He claimed that several Thai Muslims who had took refuge in 
Malaysia still have loyalty towards Thailand, but dislike Thai 
officials who are unjust and abusive. 
  He cited the arrest of four Islamic teachers on charges of 
perpetrating bomb attacks in Songkhla province as an example 
which would only worsen the situation in southern Thailand and 
sow mistrust between the state and the Muslim people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Argam's Suicidal Squads"] </F>
  [Text] Thailand was caught off guard by a problem from 
Malaysia just as the conflict over the demand for constitutional 
redrafting was causing chaos and confrontations between 
supporters and opponents and jeopardizing social peace and order 
nationwide. For sure, the problem cannot be overlooked. 
  It might be seen as a trifling report which many people can 
simply ignore. However, this issue can have an adverse impact 
on the not-so-good relations between Thailand and Malaysia, and 
cause the Islamic world to look at Thailand with suspicious 
eyes. The whole issue began when Malaysian Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Badawi revealed that the Islamic fanatic group, 
Al-Argam, was using Thailand as a training ground for its 
suicidal squads. 
  Why must the Malaysian religious group have death squads? As 
everybody knows, there have always been strong conflicts in all 
Islamic nations over the administration of the countries. The 
fanatics call for the strict enforcement of the religious law as 
prescribed in the Quran, while the others want their countries 
to be ruled by a constitution and an internationally recognized 
legal system. 
  This is the cause of the conflict in the Islamic states and 
Malaysia is no exception. Formerly, the Al-Argam group was 
included in the Malaysian Islamic Center under the jurisdiction 
of the Prime Minister's Office, the agency in charge of 
overseeing Islamic affairs. However, the Malaysian Government 
has banned Al-argam's operation since 1991, probably due to its 
rebellious nature. It is interesting to note that Al-argam was 
established 26 years ago, with suicidal squads comprising 315 
members operating in 15 countries. The organization reportedly 
uses Thailand or Bangkok as training venue for its militiamen. 
Its leader is [Assha Ari Muhammad]. 
  Up to this point, the Malaysian Government has probably been 
seeking cooperation from the Thai Government to put an end to 
Al-argam's terrorist training activities in Thailand. We 
recommend that the government pay more attention to this issue 
whether Al-argam really has its training center in Thailand or 
not. Malaysia is playing its internal political game beyond its 
boundary. Hence, Thailand is being dragged into the issue. The 
leader of Al-argam is in fact a politician. 
  It is obvious that cooperation between Thailand and Malaysia 
is a major ingredient of peaceful coexistence on this golden 
peninsular. So far in many cases cooperation between the two 
countries has not been very impressive. This is a good 
opportunity for the two countries to make serious efforts to 
strengthen their bilateral cooperation in all fields.

<F P=106> [Article: "Who Is the Real Saboteur of the Thai-Lao Trade </F>
Market?"] 
  [Text] Following the progress in Thai-Lao relations, 
currently at an all-time high, contacts between the peoples of 
the two countries have increased dramatically. Subsequently, 
the values of bilateral trade and investment are growing 
accordingly. 
  Statistics from the Customs Department show that the total 
trade values between Thailand and Laos in 1991 and 1992 were 
recorded at 3.15 and 4.01 billion baht respectively. From 
January to October 1993, the value of Thai-Lao trade rose to 
4.93 billion baht. Taking into account the illegal trade 
activities along the common border, the actual trade values 
could be five times more than those in the official records. 
  However, the governments of the two countries have imposed a 
ban on trade in certain types of commodities. Since the two 
countries share a common border as long as 1,730 kilometers with 
14 temporary and permanent border crossing points, it is not 
easy to prevent smuggling of such goods, as restricted products 
are available in the markets on both sides of the common border. 
  Ninty-five percent of commodities on sale in local market 
places from the northern to southern regions of Laos come from 
Thailand. Both the Thai and Lao Governments admit that they 
cannot really control trade between their two countries. 
  Although Thai goods are now occupying the Lao domestic 
market, it is very likely that they will lose their lion share 
in the near future, as happened in the case of the Vietnamese 
and Burmese markets, which are now being flooded with goods from 
China and Singapore. No Thai merchandise is on sale in those 
markets except a few along the borders areas. 
  This is a clear evidence of the failure of the Thai 
Government's trade policy. The Thai Government has always 
overlooked the significance of these neighboring countries. The 
Commerce Ministry, in particular, seems only to pay attention to 
distant markets. 
  Recently, the Chinese and Lao Governments signed an 
agreement 
on trade cooperation and goods exchange. Hence, Chinese goods 
will definitely push Thai products out of the Lao market in the 
next one or two years if the Thai Government remains idle and 
does nothing to prevent such an eventuality. 
  Touring different markets along the Thai-Lao border, trade 
restrictions are the main obstacle. Laos itself is unable to 
produce certain goods for its own domestic consumption; it has 
to depend on neighboring countries like Thailand. The goods 
flow into the country through both legal and illegal channels. 
  We are worried that in the next one or two years, when 
Vietnam is capable of producing more goods and the roads to Laos 
are improved, Thai goods will not be able to compete in the 
Lao domestic market. 
  We know that the tentacles of the Thai mass media can reach 
every corner in Laos and attract Lao consumers to Thai 
products. Why doesn't the Thai Government do something like 
revising the laws and regulations to promote trade between the 
two countries and help Thai goods compete with products from 
China and Vietnam. 
  We believe that the present Thai Government can solve the 
problem because it is not "that stupid." However, it must be 
sincere in dealing with the problem. 
  It's a pity that Thai business people engaging in the trade 
between the two countries are left struggling to safeguard the 
Lao market without any assistance from the government. Many 
have already given up and are simply waiting to see the end of 
the Indochina market for Thai goods. 
  It is not too difficult for the government to recognize past 
mistakes and take the necessary action to keep the entire 
Indochina market for Thai products. By so doing, it will 
sacrifice some of our immediate benefits for the sake of 
long-run interests. 
  The government must sign trade agreements with the 
Indochinese countries, China, and Burma; lower tax barriers; and 
reduce import duties on agricultural products from these 
countries. We can buy raw materials and agricultural products 
from neighboring countries and sell our finished products to 
them. 
  I want to see the day when the Indochinese countries regard 
Thailand as "Japan No. 2".

  [Text] Som Chatusiphithak, general manager of Siam City 
Bank and chairman of Thai Banking Association, disclosed that 
the association has selected its officials and representatives 
from four commercial banks -- Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, 
Siam Commercial Bank, and Thai Farmer Bank -- to be appointed as 
members of the committee of the "Thailand-Singapore Business 
Council," an organization to be active in boosting trade and 
business cooperation between the two countries. The name list 
was submitted to the council on 17 June. 
  Som said that the said organization was the result of the 
negotiations made during the latest official visit to Singapore 
of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. At the initial stage, the 
council will concentrate on working out its framework before it 
can realy start functioning in promoting free trade. 
  Som noted: "The Thailand-Singapore Business Council stresses 
on cooperation between the two countries in business and 
financial areas as well as industries concerned. More important 
is that the council will promote good understanding and 
cooperation between Thailand and Singapore as both countries are 
striving to become financial hubs in the region. It is believed 
that the council will help prevent conflict and competition."

  [Text] In order to make it more convenient for Chinese in 
southwest China to visit Thailand and following the approval of 
the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Thai Foreign Ministry decided 
to open a consulate general in Kunming City of Yunnan Province 
on 1 July. The consulate general will be responsible for issuing 
entry visas for Chinese living in Yunnan and nearby provinces so 
that those Chinese who want to travel to Thailand for 
sightseeing or visiting their relatives will not have to travel 
a long distance to apply for a visa from the Thai Embassy in 
Beijing. 
  Silachai Sulai, director of the Chiang Mai Branch of the 
Tourism Authority of Thailand, says that the establishment of 
the Thai consulate general in Kunming will help promote the 
development of a quadrangular economic, cultural, and tourism 
cooperation among Thailand, Burma, Laos, and China.

  [Text] According to a report from the Public Relations 
Office in Mae Hong Son Province, four Thai fishermen were 
ambushed while illegally fishing in the Pai River inside Burmese 
territory. Police authorities at Nam Phiang Din village rescued 
the only survivor and his long-tail boat. The fisherman, 
identified as Min, was seriously injured and later sent to 
Sisangwan Hospital. Min told the police that he and three 
colleagues of the Thai Yai ethnic group were ambushed by an 
unknown group of armed men at about 2300 on the night of 16 June 
while fishing in the Pai River inside Burma about 10 km from the 
Thai border. Min was the only one aboard the long-tailed boat 
when the ambush took place so he managed to flee the site back 
to Thailand. He believes that his three colleagues were 
probably shot dead. Any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the 
three fishermen will be reported later.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likhpai predicted before 
yesterday's crucial Phalang Tham [PDP] meeting that the third 
largest coalition party would break up. 
  Asked to predict the outcome of the meeting, at which PDP 
members were expected to consider pulling out of the coalition, 
Chuan said tersely: "Breakup". 
  Chuan was speaking after lunching with the four deputy prime 
ministers Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri (PDP deputy leader) 
and Industry Minister Sanan Khachonprasat (Democrat). 
  Asked why he looked so happy even though there are problems 
in the PDP, Chuan said there was nothing wrong with the PDP. He 
simply smiled when asked whether he would cancel a pending visit 
to South Korea. 
  Members of the PDP's religious faction have on several 
occasions called for the party to withdraw from the government 
in a bid to regain popular support. They have also threatened 
to oust Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian as party 
leader. 
  Sanan, the Democrat secretary general, said the PDP can 
handle its internal problems, but he said he didn't know what 
would happen in the event of the PDP withdrawing from the 
government. 
  "The decision will rest with the prime minister," he said. 
  Sanan dismissed speculation that he had approached 
opposition 
parties to replace the PDP. He believes the PDP's internal 
problems will be solved before Parliament debates the Budget 
Bill for the 1995 fiscal year. 
  "I'm confident the government partners can stay together," 
he 
said. 
  In the meantime, he added, there no reason for the 
government 
dissolve the House of Representatives -- and there would be no 
problem if the PDP withdrew from the government. 
  Phinit Chantarasurin (Chat Thai-Lampang) said no opposition 
party will join the Chuan administration choosing instead to 
maintain a clear and united stance. 
  "Opposition parties have promised not to join the Chuan 
government, but I can't do anything if one of then joins the 
government," he said. 
  Phinit said the government should reshuffle Cabinet line-ups 
so it can run the country in the interests of the people. The 
opposition should have a joint resolution to file a 
no-confidence motion against the government. 
  Deputy Solidarity leader Khanin Bunsuwan said his party has 
done nothing wrong and will not pull out of the coalition. Nor 
has the government any reason to sack Solidarity, he said. 
  If the Solidarity Party supports a motion sponsored by 21 
PDP 
rebels, it would have to consider the new conditions, Kanin 
said. The party vowed to support the motion last week, but the 
motion was not debated.

  [Text] All 15 Phalang Tham [PDP] hardliners resigned en 
masse from the party's executive committee last night as a 
crucial party caucus resolved to remain with the Chuan coalition. 
  The resignation of the majority of the executive board 
effectively warrants a new election of the executive line-up, 
which observers said would have to decide again on the question 
of whether the party should stay with the government. 
  Yasothon MP Sombun Thongburan said he and 14 other hardline 
members of the board submitted letters of resignation to party 
leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian during yesterday's meeting. An 
election of the new board must be held within a month. 
  Sombun said the resignations were motivated by "total 
political failure" of the party's executives. 
  The decision to remain with the government was adopted after 
a marathon debate lasting six hours, during which the hardliners 
lambasted the performance of Phalang Tham's executives. 
  "We resolved not to pull out of the coalition and to 
continue 
to give the government our solid support," Phalang Tham leader 
Bunchu Rotchanasathian told reporters at the end of the meeting. 
  Earlier, party members voted in a split decision to revive 
its controversial motion on charter reform for this week's House 
deliberation and to ask the coalition to allow a free vote. 
  Twenty-four participants approved a proposal for Phalang 
Tham 
to renew its push for the motion seeking to establish a House 
committee to draft a new Constitution. Twenty others, including 
party leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian, voted against it. 
  The decision means Phalang Tham will seek to push the motion 
up the parliamentary agenda this week. It coincided with a 
government whips' resolution allowing Phalang Tham to continue 
pushing unilaterally for the motion. 
  The coalition whips agreed that the motion, submitted by 21 
Phalang Tham MPs sympathizing with radical pro-reform activists 
and shelved last week because of pressure from Phalang Tham 
allies, can be debated in the House on Thursday. 
  "If necessary, the motion can be moved forward and the 
Phalang Tham Party can have a free vote on it," PM's [Prime 
Minister's] Office Minister and chief whip Thoetphong Chaiyanan 
said. 
  But he added that the four other coalition parties would not 
support the motion. 
  A resolution by whips not to support the motion sponsored by 
21 Phalang Tham MPs outraged Phalang Tham hardliners, who vowed 
to push for their party's withdrawal from the coalition at 
yesterday's meeting. The whips' pressure last week prevented 
Phalang Tham from asking the House of Representatives to move 
the motion up from the bottom of a 28-motion agenda. 
  Thoetphong said the whips had not decided to try to help the 
PDP solve its crisis by allowing the party to move the motion up 
on the agenda. 
  Phalang Tham members were divided over the issue of pulling 
out of the coalition. But tension within the party could 
subside if the controversial motion was debated in Parliament. 
  Thoetphong dismissed speculation that whips resolved last 
Friday to expel the PDP from the coalition if its rebel faction 
pushed for an early debate on the controversial motion. 
  Solidarity Party secretary general and deputy Commerce 
Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap said his party would support the 
motion. 
  [Text] Thoetphong said government whips agreed that if 
coalition parties wanted to vote for the motion, they would have 
to inform him first. 
  Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said it was a 
"misunderstanding" that government whips had prevented the 
rebels from having their motion debated last week. 
  "The motion can be moved forward, if necessary," he said. 
  PDP Secretary-General Udon Tantisunthon said it was now up 
to 
Phalang Tham members to decide if they want to move the motion 
up on the agenda. 
  The Phalang Tham meeting, chaired by party leader Bunchu, 
was 
held under tight restrictions. Non-MP and non-executive members 
of the party were not allowed in. Participants were subject to 
body searches as part of a ban on tape recorders. 
  Earlier yesterday, the pro-Bunchu faction seemed to have 
scored a morale-boosting victory when the Interior Ministry 
approved the new official line-up of Phalang Tham executive 
members. 
  The approval effectively barred the most outspoken 
hardliner, 
Chaiwat Sinsuwong, who was a member of the old executive board, 
from yesterday's meeting. Earlier, members of both old and new 
executive boards were invited to the meeting. 
  Thamrong Saengsuriyachan, another hardliner, claimed there 
was a conspiracy between the "ministerial wing" of the PDP, 
party member holding Cabinet positions, to bar Chaiwat from the 
crucial meeting. 
  Normally, it took the ministry a least a week to approve an 
executive line-up of a political party, said Thamrong. He added 
that the Phalang Tham line-up was approved in only two hours. 
  Before and during the meeting Chaiwat and a few other former 
Phalang Tham executives held serious discussions in another room 
of the hotel and kept monitoring the meeting through Bangkok MP 
Sudarat Keyuraphan who kept shuttling between the meeting room 
and Chaiwat's group. 
  Before the meeting, Phalang Tham founder Chamlong Simuang 
told reporters it was Bunchu who would set the direction for the 
discussion. Bunchu, meanwhile, vowed to allow an "open debate" 
on the party's future. 
  The meeting was held as activist Chalat Worachat, whose 
hunger strike to press for controversial pre-reform demands 
triggered the current political crisis, returned to his protest 
site in front of Parliament to continue his fast. He gave 
himself up to police last week to face charges of sedition and 
lese majeste but was released on bail on Sunday night. 
  Chamlong yesterday refused to comment on Chalat's new move. 
Earlier, the "ministerial wing" had seriously questioned 
Chalat's motives and said the activist had been "used" by groups 
bent on toppling the government. 
  The 21 MPs who submitted the controversial motion seeking to 
establish a House committee to draft a new charter insisted they 
did so to save Chalat's life. 
  Bangkok MP Sutin Nopphaket, who initiated the motion, said 
before the meeting yesterday that even though the issue of 
whether the motion should be moved forward was settled, the 
party must consider whether it should remain with the government. 
  "We want the party to stay with dignity, not under the 
influence of others," Suthin said. 
  The opposition last week promised to vote for the motion. 
But after it was shelved last week opposition leaders backed 
down from the pledge.

  [Text] The easing of Thailand's political crisis has 
helped restore overseas confidence in the Government's stability 
and the country's investment climate, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Surin Phitsuwan insisted yesterday. 
  "I was glad everything ended that way," Mr Surin said. 
  Political turmoil stemming from calls for a new constitution 
prompted other countries to look at Thailand with suspicion 
since an international agreement stipulated that any 
international accords could be enforced only after they were 
legally approved through constitutional procedures of respective 
countries, he said. 
  Concern had grown that if the Government bowed to demand by 
a 
group of people, foreign investors would be reluctant to invest 
in Thailand as they would fear changes in the constitution any 
time. 
  "If we started by avoiding adherence to constitutional 
principles, no one could have confidence." he said. 
  Thailand's political situation, which became tense after 
political activist Chalat Worachat staged a hunger strike to 
press for the Government to draw up a more democratic 
constitution, eased after Mr Chalat called off his protest on 
Thursday. 
  Mr Surin said neighbouring countries were worried that 
Thailand's political crisis, if prolonged, could affect 
negotiations on cooperation in the establishment of the Growth 
Triangle and the Growth Quadrangle as well as the use of water 
and other resources in the Mekong River. 
  He invited suggestions from academics and businessmen on how 
Thailand should proceed politically and how it could best 
protect its democratic system. 
  Mr Surin, however, conceded he was "a little bit worried" 
about problems within the Phalang Tham Party [PTP] hut' said 
disputes and rifts were common in politics and that the party 
needed time to adjust to any changes. 
  "The party needs to reorganise its own system. The Democrat 
Party went through that process before." 
  In the end, all party members had to accept the decision of 
the majority, he said. 
  Mr Surin said that people should not be pessimistic about 
the 
future of Thai politics following reports that the PTP might 
withdraw from the Government, since Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
was still confident all would go well. 
  He said Mr Chuan would not dissolve the House of 
Representatives and would go on working with the five coalition 
parties. 
  Mr Surin asked the public not to give importance to reports 
that the Democrat Party had approached certain Opposition 
parties to join the Government. 
  According to Mr Surin, the Government has three options to 
solve its problems: dissolving the House, reshuffling the 
Cabinet or seeking settlements among the five parties. 
  Mr Surin said the best exit was for all five parties to 
discuss how to prevent disputes from recurring as well as iron 
out their differences. 
  He said the Premier would not intervene in the internal 
problems of the PTP.

<F P=106> [Article by Natthaya Chetchotirot: "Facing Ally Crisis, </F>
Democrats May Have No Way Out But Opt for House Dissolution] 
  [Text] House Speaker Wan Muhamat Nomatha of the New 
Aspiration Party [NAP] pressed the button to signal the 
adjournment of the parliamentary meeting Thursday afternoon, 
several Phalang Tham Party (PTP) members knew it was the last 
straw that they would put up with the Democrats. The 
adjournment of the meeting, which was seen as a tactic employed 
by the Democrats in collaboration with the NAP, effectively 
blocked the attempt by 21 PTP rebel MPs to move forward their 
motion for constitutional reform which they had hoped to be 
debated in the House on Thursday. Had the motion been passed 
which the PTP expected so with the backing of the Opposition and 
the Solidarity, another coalition party, Chalat Worachat would 
have ended his fast and the protest would be over. 
  The fact that the PTP rebels were outwitted by the Democrats 
could be attributable to their political apprenticeship compared 
to the Democrats' mastery in political intrigue and treachery. 
Several members of the temple faction in the PTP have also 
blamed some senior party members of working "hands in gloves" 
with the Democrats to block the rebels' charter motion. 
  The setback sustained by the PTP rebels and the temple 
faction including de facto leader Chamlong Simuang, came one day 
after the party managed to enlist unanimous support from the 
executive committee for the rebels' motion for constitutional 
reform. This was something unusual because the party itself was 
earlier widely split over the motion issue. Yet, they did not 
discuss about moving forward the charter motion and would ask 
for the motion to be moved forward at the parliamentary floor. 
The rebels had hoped that this would be discussed on Thursday. 
  But the golden opportunity was missed out. Government whips 
moved quickly by holding a meeting Thursday morning which ended 
with a resolution for the PTP not to move forward the motion of 
the rebels. Bound by the resolution, the rebels did not ask to 
move forward their motion, hoping that this would be done by the 
Opposition or the Solidarity Party. Eventually, they realised 
that neither the two sides would request the motion to be moved 
forward, the PTP rebels tried to initiate the move themselves 
and to enlist their support. By the time they regrouped, it was 
already too late. The House was adjourned before the move 
materialised. 
  For the time being, there was nothing that the PTP rebels 
and 
the temple faction could do until next Thursday when the House 
reconvenes to consider motions. Badly outmanoeuvred and 
outwitted, the only trump card that Chamlong has in his hand and 
that he could play is to pull out of the coalition government. 
A meeting of the executive committee was tentatively scheduled 
this Monday during which an important decision would be made. 
And the likelihood is that the party, with the urging of 
Chamlong, will opt to withdraw. 
  The stage has already been set to put pressure on the PTP to 
call it quit. Sudarat Keyuraphan yesterday resigned as deputy 
government spokeswoman. Ruangwit Dusadisuraphot and Thamrong 
Saengsuriyachan also quit as deputy secretary-general of the 
prime minister and government whip respectively, citing their 
conflicting views with those of the government. 
  Without any doubt, this whole political episode has driven a 
deep wedge within the PTP as never before. The chasm of 
division will be further widened if the party decides to pull 
out. The temple faction will certainly demand pulling out and 
this is most likely to be resisted by the ministers and the 
so-called layman faction. Some observers believe that Chamlong 
may have to come back to take the rein of the party and to 
assert his authority to put his own house in order. The task is 
easier said than done because it may involve some sacrifices. 
But there seems to be little choice if the PTP wants to restore 
its bruised image and also if it intends to stay on in the 
political arena. 
  If the pullout of the PTP is intended to force the hand of 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to dissolve the Parliament and call 
a new general election, then this is likely to be strongly 
resisted by Mr Chuan who has, on various occasions, announced 
that he would not dissolve the Parliament. This will be the 
last option if other alternatives do not work out. 
  Behind-the-scenes political manoeuvrings have reportedly 
started when news leaked about the PTP threat to withdraw. 
Informed political sources said the Democrats through their new 
deal-maker, Agriculture Minister and deputy secretary-general 
Niphon Phromphan, would approach the opposition Chat Thai or the 
Chat Phatthana parties to replace the PTP should the PTP 
actually calls it quit. 
  Both Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana earlier announced openly 
that they would not simply replace the PTP. Instead, they want 
a major Cabinet reshuffle with the prime minister resigning in 
order that a new Cabinet can be formed. This may sound to be 
too much for the Democrats because of their mistrust towards the 
two opposition parties. 
  Provided that there is no change of position from either the 
Chat Thai or the Chat Phatthana Party and if the Democrats is 
unreluctant to part with the New Aspiration, the Democrats may 
not be able to find a new partner to replace the PTP and have no 
choice but to dissolve the Parliament. 
  But anything is possible in Thai politics. An ally today may 
become an enemy the next day. And today's foe may turn out to 
be an ally the following day. 
  After all, it was the Democrats themselves who have pushed 
themselves into the corner. Had they been less stubborn and 
more flexible and had they allowed the PTP rebels' motion to be 
debated in the Parliament, they would not have plunged 
themselves into yet another crisis.

  [Text] A pro-democracy activist claimed yesterday that 
officials loyal to the Democrat Party [DP] paid hard cash to 
tambon and village chiefs to bus befuddled villagers to 
political rallies staged to suggest mass support for beleaguered 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. 
  Suphap Phutthongsi, chairman of the Confederation for 
Democracy in Loei province, said kamnans (tambon chiefs) and 
village headmen in his province were hired by provincial 
officials to stage a pro-Chuan rally on Wednesday in front of 
the city hall. 
  The allegation was not confirmed by local officials. 
  He said kamnans received Bt[baht]300 each, while Bt200 was 
paid to the headmen. Car drivers who transported villagers to 
the site of the protest received Bt300. 
  Suphap said he was in no doubt that, the payments had been 
made, because the kamnans and headmen had given him the details 
personally. 
  He said the villagers who participated in the orchestrated 
show of support had received nothing and some did not even know 
what they were supposed to do when they arrived at the protest. 
Some of them only went because they already had plans to go 
shopping and the offer of a free lift was welcomed. 
  "Some of them told me they were about to go to their rice 
fields but phuyaibans [village headmen] come to pick them up and 
take them into town straight away. They didn't even know why 
they had to go," he said. 
  Suphap said the province had spent about Bt200,000 hiring 
kamnans and headmen to stage the mass rally against Chalat. 
  Buawaeng Suphrom-in, village headman of Loei's Chiangkhan 
district, said he was ordered by an assistant district chief to 
take about 10 villagers to the city. 
  He said the chief had promised to give him a big sum of 
money. But after the rally was over the money had been withheld. 
  Buawaeng said he personally agreed with Chalat's protest for 
fuller democracy. 
  Rallies in Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Nakhon 
Phanom, Mukdahan and Rayong continued yesterday. 
  In Nakhon Ratchasima, more than a thousand people from Wang 
Nam Khieo and Kham Thaleso district gathered to show moral 
support for Chuan through their chief district officers. 
  Nakhon Si Thammarat Governor Sucham Phongnua said he was 
very 
worried that there could be a violent confrontation between 
pro-democracy supporters and pro-Chuan demonstrators. 
  He said he has warned Chalat's supporters to stop using a 
loud speaker which was apparently annoying people in Muang 
district. He said police would take tough action against anyone 
who incited violence in the province. 
  In Nakhon Phanom, about 10,000 people turned up in front of 
the city hall to show their support for Chuan. It was not clear 
whether they had been paid to participate, but Governor Sucharit 
Patchimnan said the supporters had turned up spontaneously on 
their own free will. 
  About 4,000 people rallied in front of Rayong City Hall and 
presented a bouquet of flowers to Chuan through their governor. 
  Meanwhile, about a thousand people continued their vigil 
outside Parliament in support of Chalat as he entered the fourth 
week of his fast and came to the end of his "sit-in". 
  Chalat's daughter Chitrawadi said the Democrat Party would 
be 
to blame if her father died. 
  Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-araya said 
Interior 
Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut had ordered him "to take control" 
of the situation in front of Parliament. 
  Ari said Chalat might not die but could be permanently 
disabled if he continued his fast. 
  National Police Chief Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin 
Santipraphop said he was worried about traffic conditions on 
Uthong Nai Road near the site of Chalat's protest. 
  A group of about 10 people who called themselves "southern 
villagers" yesterday afternoon laid a wreath for Democrat MPs in 
front of Parliament. 
  After Chalat's departure to the Police Hospital, popular 
entertainer Yunyong Ophakun continued singing to maintain the 
morale of those who had gathered to support Chalat.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chuan Must Give Top Priority to National </F>
Interest"] 
  [Text] At the end of what has seemed an interminable 
protest by supporters of hunger striker Chalat Worachat, we are 
left with a question of judgment: how can Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai reconcile his political principles with the call for 
political reform by disgruntled MPs in the Phalang Tham Party 
[PTP], the third largest partner in his coalition government? 
  There seems to be no clear consensus on such an important 
question, as the 21 dissident PTP members, apparently with the 
support of party founder Chamlong Simuang, threaten to withdraw 
their support for the government. 
  The Prime Minister maintained on Friday that he still had 
the 
support of the PTP. But events in the Phalang Tham Party were 
not encouraging. 
  A few hours before Chuan made his statement, three prominent 
PTP members submitted their resignation from political positions 
in the government. 
  The PTP members were apparently upset by the government 
whip's decision on Thursday to block a motion tabled by their 
colleagues seeking to set up a committee to draft a new 
constitution. 
  The situation is made even more complicated by early signs 
that tomorrow's meeting of the PTP's executive committee could 
develop into a resolution to withdraw from the Coalition. 
  "We will leave it to Prime Minister Chuan to decide whether 
to reshuffle the Cabinet or to dissolve the Lower House," a PTP 
source told the press on Thursday night, after the 21 
disgruntled PTP MPs held a meeting to discuss the government 
whip's action. 
  Regardless of the outcome of the PTP executive committee 
meeting, Chuan should consider the matter from the perspective 
of whether his decision will be to the advantage of the people. 
  Many PTP members have been unhappy since the party decided 
to 
join the Coalition some 20 months ago. Many of the PTP's major 
policy issues have not received the full backing of the 
government. Among these issues are the decentralization of 
administrative power, the traffic problems, and efforts to help 
defuse the "Chalat crisis" by reforming the country's democracy 
through the 21 MPs' motion. 
  The end of the protest by Chalat's supporters at least 
offers 
Chuan the chance of getting back on course, of mending ties with 
his coalition partners. He can start by seeking a meeting with 
Chamlong, and try to reach a settlement that will pacify those 
MPs who keep the conflict burning. 
  If there's no hope of a reconciliation with the PTP, Chuan 
may have to think about a new coalition lineup that may include 
an opposition party. The issue is whether there will be a 
simple conclusion to the move toward realignment. The formation 
of new partnerships between political parties is always easier 
said than done. 
  For a start, Chuan will have to consult with the three other 
coalition partners, namely the New Aspiration, Seritham and 
Solidarity parties. More importantly, the selection of a new 
political partner must be carried out in the manner understood 
by the people. 
  The country's economic development cannot be maintained with 
an endless series of political manoeuvring. The political game 
being played has caused people in business to feel uneasy. 
  In forming a new government, Chuan must also ensure that the 
campaign for political reform -- set in motion by hunger striker 
Chalat Worachat and pro-democracy groups is not stopped. 
Learning from the Chalat fiasco, any new government must deal 
squarely with establishing political ethics and firm political 
foundations that will promote greater public participation in 
grassroots politics. 
  The support of the people cannot be gained if politicians 
were to make efforts at forming partnership for the sole purpose 
of gaining control of the Government.

  [Text] The Bank of Thailand hopes that higher interest 
rates will boost savings and cut spending in the next two months 
as part of the process of putting the brakes on inflation, 
according to the central bank governor. 
  Wichit Suphinit said the Bank of Thailand would in July 
evaluate all economic indicators for the first half of the year 
to determine the need for policy changes. 
  The bank will also evaluate whether domestic production 
capacity will have an effect on long-term inflation. "We have 
to see if there is sufficient domestic capacity to meet local 
demand." 
  Inflation has become the bank's priority concern since the 
May consumer price index rose to 5.1 per cent compared with the 
same period last year. 
  Increases in crude oil prices, food prices and non-food 
items 
led by education and recreation costs have contributed to higher 
prices. The inflation rate measured on the moving 12-month 
average was up 0.2 percentage points in May from April to 3.9 
per cent. 
  Wichit has identified excessive credit extension by 
commercial banks as the main cause of higher inflation. Credit 
extension by all banks in the first four months of the year grew 
24 per cent compared with the target of 21 per cent for the 
entire year. 
  Roengchai Marakanon, deputy central bank governor, has 
identified higher spending on personal consumption and 
recreation as accounting for about 40 per cent of the higher 
inflation rate. 
  Another 40 per cent was attributable to higher agricultural 
prices given the world recovery in commodities. The higher cost 
of labour and oil is believed to account for a further 14 per 
cent of the increased inflation rate. 
  Savings during the same period grew less than the target. 
The actual growth figure in the first four months was 14 per 
cent compared with the target of 19 per cent. 
  Wichit said the Bank of Thailand has already signalled 
commercial banks to raise interest rates which he added would 
take two to six months to work through the economy. 
  He said the central bank will have to wait and see if higher 
interest rates would cut consumer spending and boost savings. 
  But he did not see higher interest rates dampening 
investment 
given that companies can borrow externally at more favourable 
rates. 
  -- The government is working on a draft "White Paper" 
which will serve as the basis for the upcoming 8th National 
Plan, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak said 
yesterday. 
  But first it has to analyse the results of the National 
Economic and Social Development Board's 7th plan, he said. 
  Suphachai said the White Paper is scheduled for release in 
August and will be used to gauge opinion in the private sector. 
  The White Paper will cover four major areas: 
  -- How to increase exports from the present 0.9 per cent 
share to 1.8 per cent of world trade. 
  -- The government's plan to promote research and 
development by providing tax and other incentives for foreign 
investors wishing to set up R&amp;D divisions in Thailand. 
  -- Promote industry, and add more industries as 
appropriate to the National Plan. 
  -- Stipulate what the government should do to promote the 
economy generally. 
  Suphachai said the present 15 per cent inflation rate is not 
particularly worrisome since the increase was due to the sudden 
rise in the cost of food and farm products. The rise is only 
temporary, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will set up a forum to promote tourism between the two countries 
as one way to help correct the bilateral trade imbalance, the 
Ministry of Transport said Monday [20 June]. 
  The program aims to double the total number of tourists to 
each country every year to about eight million people by the 
year 2000. 
  Officials said the ministry has agreed with the U.S. 
Commerce 
Department to set up the joint forum for the program and to hold 
the first meeting in the U.S. sometime in fall. 
  Some 3.5 million Japanese visit the U.S. every year at 
present, while 500,000 Americans come to Japan annually. 
  Japanese tourists pump about 10 billion dollars more into 
the 
U.S. economy per year than is generated in tourism-related 
spending in Japan by Americans. 
  If the number of tourists on each side was doubled and thus 
Japanese tourism spending in the U.S. double-folded, it would 
help put a dent in the huge trade imbalance which is currently 
in Japan's favor, the officials said. 
  The program is also expected to deepen people's 
understanding 
of one another's nation, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The Japan-U.S. Economic 
Council on Monday [20 June] formally elected Yotaro Kobayashi, 
chairman of Fuji Xerox Co., as the new council chief, council 
officials said Monday. 
  Kobayashi replaces Akio Morita, the former chairman of Sony 
Corp. who is currently undergoing medical treatment after 
suffering a cerebral hemorrhage late last year, the officials 
said. 
  The Council, which is made up of influential Japanese 
business leaders, is a preparatory organization for the annual 
Japan-U.S. business conference which holds debates on trade and 
economic problems between the two countries. The three-day 
conference will be held in Tokyo from July 10. 
  Kobayashi told a press conference after the meeting that the 
Council will create objective standards by which to gauge the 
progress of market-opening measures, and will jointly establish 
a working group for discussions on deregulation by both 
countries at the next conference.

  [Text] Vienna, June 21 KYODO -- North Korea has extended 
visas for the two inspectors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) who remained at the nuclear complex in Yongbyon, 
IAEA sources said Monday. 
  The sources interpreted the visa extension shortly ahead of 
an expected meeting between U.S. and North Korean diplomats 
Tuesday as a conciliatory gesture from Pyongyang to set the tone 
for the talks. 
  The inspectors' visas, which would have expired at the end 
of 
this month, were extended for two weeks, they said. 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song promised former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter during unofficial talks in Pyongyang last 
week he would allow the two officials to stay. 
  Commenting on Carter's trip, U.S. President Bill Clinton saw 
"hopeful signs" earlier Monday for an end to the standoff over 
North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  Speaking in a live TV interview, Clinton said the U.S. will 
resume high-level talks with North Korea provided Pyongyang 
keeps its promise to freeze its controversial nuclear program. 
  Upon return from Pyongyang Carter declared Sunday that "I 
personally believe the crisis is over" and that Kim "wants to be 
sure" the crisis on the Korean peninsula is over. 
  North Korea in may started to remove the fuel rods in its 
5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of 
Pyongyang, without the required agency supervision. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog pulled out its team in late May 
after negotiations with Pyongyang broke down over the 
inspectors' demand to be able to select, segregate and secure 
some 300 fuel rods for measurement needed to verify whether 
nuclear material had been diverted in the past. 
  In response to a request by the U.N. Security Council, the 
agency, however, retained two inspectors to report on the 
removal activities. 
  They have since been observing the fuel removal and were 
allowed to continue checks of surveillance cameras at Yongbyon 
facilities. 
  According to their report, reactor workers have meanwhile 
discharged all spent nuclear fuel rods, but have not yet started 
to load the reactor core with new ones.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Text] At today's meeting of the House of Councillors' 
Budget Committee, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata explained his 
recent remark during a public speech on the street that he 
believed North Korea did not possess nuclear weapons. He said 
that was more an expression of his hope. 
  At the House of Councillors' Budget Committee today, Minao 
Hattori of the Liberal Democratic Party and others questioned 
Hata's remark during a wayside speech on 18 June that he 
believed North Korea did not actually possess nuclear arms and 
had no intention to produce them. They said this is in conflict 
with the government's official view so far. 
  In reply, Hata explained that since North Korea claims that 
it has neither the capability, nor the intention to manufacture 
nuclear arms, his remark was really an expression of his hope. 
He also said he regretted that his statement could lead to 
misunderstanding. He indicated the government's consensus on 
this matter is that North Korea may have produced more plutonium 
than it has declared, and it would be a serious matter if such 
plutonium is being used to manufacture nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa on Tuesday reiterated a demand that Pyongyang provide 
information that would enable international monitors to verify 
whether North Korea had extracted plutonium from its nuclear 
facilities in the past. 
  Japan "would be able to extend a helping hand to North Korea 
if the history of the operations of its nuclear facilities were 
revealed to verify whether plutonium is clandestinely 
stockpiled," Kakizawa told a house of representative panel on 
cabinet affairs. 
  The foreign minister also expressed readiness to give 
economic aid, including funds to finance construction of 
light-water nuclear reactors, if Pyongyang is forthcoming in 
divulging data on the history of its nuclear reactors. 
  He also reiterated Japan's resolve to seek the deletion of 
an 
"enemy clause" from the U.N. Charter in the process of ongoing 
discussions on reforming the framework of the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  The charter has described Japan, Germany and other states 
defeated by the Allied Forces during World War II as enemy 
states -- a description that has embarrassed these U.N. member 
states, now seeking to contribute to global peace.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A senior Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) official said Tuesday he got the impression that 
North Korea has nuclear weapons during his recent trip to 
Pyongyang. 
  "From the series of talks (with North Korean officials), I 
got an impression that the country possesses nuclear weapons," 
Yoichi Tani told a press conference. 
  Tani, along with former Defense Agency head Taku Yamasaki, 
visited North Korea last week and held talks with North Korean 
officials, including Korean Workers' Party Secretaries Kim 
Yong-son and Hwang Chang-yop. 
  Tani criticized recent remarks by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, who said he did not believe North Korea has atomic bombs. 
"I don't have the slightest idea why he said such a thing," Tani 
said. 
  Yamasaki, also at the press conference, said North Korea is 
now considering opening the door to its market after solving the 
nuclear issue diplomatically.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Toyota Motor Corp. has 
started talks with a major Chinese automaker on possible joint 
car production, Toyota officials said Monday [20 June]. 
  Toyota sent two executives to China on Sunday for talks with 
Tianjin Automobile Industrial Corp., the officials said. 
  The two executives are Akira Takahashi, senior managing 
director for production technology, and Akira Yokoi, managing 
director for external affairs. 
  During their visit until Thursday, they will hold talks with 
Tianjin officials over the possibility of forming a joint 
venture, they said. 
  Moreover, the two Toyota officials will obtain information 
on 
China's policy on the participation of foreign capital in new 
passenger car manufacturing operations expected to be introduced 
in 1996. 
  Toyota's car production in China, if realized, is expected 
to 
encourage other Japanese and foreign automakers, industry 
analysts said. 
  Already, Ford Motor Co. of the United States and Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. of Japan have declared their intent to move into 
the Chinese market. 
  Toyota has supplied state-owned Jinbei (Gold Cup) automotive 
in Shenyang with commercial-vehicle technology. 
  But it believes Tianjin Automobile Industrial would be the 
most appropriate production partner among China's eight car 
producers, since the company is expected to form the "core" of 
the Chinese auto industry in the future. 
  Tianjin has been turning out cars in a tie-up with Daihatsu 
Motor Co. of the Toyota group. 
  Chinese officials say China plans to create six or seven 
conglomerates by the year 2000, each capable of churning out 
300,000 cars a year. These would be further reshuffled into 
three or four giants in the early decades of the next century.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- More than half of small 
Japanese manufacturers responding to a poll on their planned 
overseas investments see China as their first choice, a Tokyo 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey showed Monday [20 June]. 
  The survey covered 2,300 small and midsize manufacturing 
members of the chamber. Of the total, 22.1 percent, or 509 
firms, responded. 
  According to results of the survey and observations of 
industry analysts, Japan can expect further "hollowing out" of 
its industrial base in the coming years. The analysts noted 
that high domestic wages, coupled with an eroding international 
competitive power due to the yen's rise, are prompting smaller 
firms to set up shop in foreign countries. 
  Of the respondents, 24.2 percent said they have already set 
up wholly owned subsidiaries abroad or acquired an equity stake 
in overseas businesses. 
  The survey also found that 21.6 percent of the respondents 
plan to invest abroad. Of these, 91.8 percent said they intend 
to invest in Asian countries, with China ranking the highest in 
popularity, followed by Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Mitsubishi Oil Co. 
announced Monday [20 June] its subsidiary has discovered a 
potentially rich oil field off the southern coast of Vietnam. 
  The area, spanning 3,370 square kilometers, lies about 80 to 
200 km southeast of Ho Chi Minh city near the Bach Ho oil field. 
  Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co. (JVPC) spudded the well in late 
April and started production tests from mid-June at a depth of 
more than 3,000 meters. 
  The company found that more than 10,000 barrels of light 
crude oil could be produced daily -- the greatest production on 
a test basis in Southeast Asia. 
  The oil is seen as a high-quality, low-sulfur crude similar 
to that of the Bach Ho oil field which produces 130,000 barrels 
daily. 
  JVPC officials said they will hold discussions with the 
Vietnamese Government on further development of the area, which 
they believe could turn out a huge oil field. The company hopes 
to begin commercial production as early as the latter half of 
1996. 
  Several oil companies are continuing exploration along the 
southern coast in the hope of tapping abundant oil fields.

underrepresented constituencies while eliminating four seats 
from three overrepresented electorates, officials said. 
  The five parties and parliamentary groups that tabled the

Government Party], the Shin Ryokufu Kai and the Niin Club. The 
Shin Ryokufu Kai groups Shinseito, the Japan New Party, the 
Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic Reform Party. 
  The parties plan to push the bill through the upper 
chamber's 
ad hoc panel on political reform Tuesday and obtain approval 
from the upper chamber's plenary session on Wednesday, the 
officials said. 
  The bill, if legislated, would assuage the current imbalance 
in voter representation in upper house constituencies by 
obligating legislators to contest the next upper house election, 
slated for the summer of 1995, under the revised appropriation 
of seats, the officials said. 
  The bill envisages increasing by one the number of seats in 
each of four underrepresented prefectures of Miyazaki, Saitama, 
Kanagawa and Gifu, while taking away two seats from the 
prefecture of Hokkaido and one seat each from the prefectures of 
Hyogo and Fukuoka, they said. 
  The bill would also soften a legal requirement under which a 
party or parliamentary group is empowered to field candidates in 
the nationwide constituency of proportional representation. 
  Under the bill, all political parties or parliamentary 
groups 
that garnered more than 2 percent of total valid votes cast 
nationwide in the most recent national election would be 
eligible to field candidates under the proportional 
representation formula, they said. 
  Currently, a political party or parliamentary group must 
garner 4 percent of such votes to qualify.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Tuesday renewed a call for contesting the next general 
election for the House of Representatives under a new electoral 
system constructed after years of political reform efforts. 
  "The last resort the premier can use when facing off with 
parliament is the right to dissolve (the lower house) and I 
won't throw this away," Hata said in a television interview. 
  But Hata, who has governed with minority support since late 
April, said the public will be disillusioned if the next general 
poll is contested under the current multiseat system and the 
nation's years of political reform efforts are foiled. 
  An election under the existing system, which is soon to be 
replaced by a new system combining single-seat constituencies 
with proportional representation, "is not unimaginable," the 
premier said. "(But) the next election should be contested under 
the system of single-seat voting districts combined with 
proportional representation," Hata said. 
  Although the Diet legislated in January a package of 
electoral reform bills for the lower house, the additional 
passage of a yet- to-be-formulated bill that redraws the 
electoral map is required to allow the next election to be 
lawfully contested under the new system. 
  The primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is 
poised to file a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet 
after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget clears the 
Diet on Thursday. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former 
member of the ruling coalition and now the second largest 
opposition force, has also threatened to bring down the Hata 
government in a no-confidence vote. 
  The premier said he will continue efforts to bring the SDP 
back into the fold, because in the last government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the SDP and other coalition 
partners, including Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
managed to resolve differences over a host of key policy issues. 
  Hata also said he will welcome those who break away from the 
LDP and join forces with the coalition if they are determined to 
push for national reforms. 
  On the economic front, the premier spoke of the need to 
increase indirect taxes so as not only to continue large-scale 
income and residential tax cuts in 1995 and beyond but also to 
secure revenue for future national reform programs. 
  Hata expressed hope that the tension on the Korean peninsula 
will be defused after the United States and North Korea resume 
high-level talks on Pyongyang's alleged push for nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The House of Councilors' ad 
hoc committee on political reform on Tuesday [21 June] passed 
bills to modify the constituencies for upper house elections. 
  The bills, submitted jointly by the Liberal Democratic 
Party, 
the Social Democratic Party and three other groups, are designed 
to achieve a better balance in representation by adding one seat 
each in four constituencies, while slashing four seats from 
others. 
  There will be no change in the size of the second chamber at 
252 seats. 
  The bills are scheduled to be sent to the House of 
Representatives after their expected passage Wednesday by the 
full upper house.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- The leadership of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan 
-- SDPJ] decided Monday [20 June] night to seek a summit meeting 
with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as early as Wednesday to 
request his voluntary resignation, SDP officials said. 
  They said SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and senior SDP 
officials also decided to draw up a blueprint of a new 
government, of which the nation's second-largest political party 
would be part. 
  Earlier in the day, Murayama said his party will seek a 
temporary alliance with the largest opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) to call for a snap poll if planned 
realliance talks with the ruling coalition fail. 
  Murayama told a meeting of the party's former Diet members 
that the SDP should join hands with the LDP to create a 
temporary cabinet if talks with the minority coalition of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata break down and, consequently, Hata is 
forced to resign after a no- confidence vote. 
  The LDP, ousted last year after 38 years in power, has 
pledged to submit a no-confidence motion against the shaky Hata 
cabinet after the budget bills pass the Diet, expected within a 
week. 
  If the SDP supports the LDP move, that will clinch the no- 
confidence vote, leaving Hata with a choice of resigning with 
his ministers or dissolving the House of Representatives for 
snap elections. 
  Hata has made clear that he will step down if a 
no-confidence 
vote passes the lower house.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed Tuesday night to take a 
formal decision Wednesday on the submission of a no-confidence 
motion against the coalition government of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, party officials said. 
  Under the accord reached by LDP head Yohei Kono and other

authorize the motion, which it hopes will be joined by the 
second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). 
  The accord came amid a flurry of strategic talks held 
separately by the SDP, which quit the governing alliance in 
April, and coalition parties seeking to lure the SDP back into 
the fold.

  The SDP left the coalition in April and has threatened to 
join the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 
seeking a no-confidence vote if Hata refuses to step down 
together with his ministers.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives Budget Committee is scheduled to summon former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday [21 June] afternoon 
as a sworn witness over his alleged financial irregularities. 
  But leaders of the Japan New Party (JNP), headed by 
Hosokawa, 
said Hosokawa and coalition partners will not appear before the 
committee unless it votes again on the resolution to summon the 
former prime minister. 
  The JNP claims the committee's decision to summon Hosokawa 
is 
"invalid" because of improper parliamentary procedures. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], reiterated at a press meeting Monday that Hosokawa does 
not have to testify in the Diet about his suspected financial 
deals. He also said the lower house Budget Committee's decision 
was invalid, violating parliamentary rules. 
  Secretaries general of the coalition parties will make a 
final decision at a meeting slated for Tuesday morning, parties 
sources said. 
  However Tsuruo Yamaguchi, chairman of the lower house Budget 
Committee, and opposition parties have rejected another call on 
the resolution to summon Hosokawa, saying that no improper 
procedure occurred in the decision. 
  At a session of the Budget Committee last Thursday, 
Yamaguchi 
declared that his panel unanimously approved a proposal to 
summon the former prime minister. 
  Observers said if Hosokawa fails to appear before the Diet 
committee, the opposition camp would intensify criticism against 
him for covering up suspicion over financial irregularities. 
  They added if Hosokawa rejects the Diet testimony, the 
Liberal Democratic Party and some members of the Social 
Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan] would add 
pressure to submit a no-confidence vote against the cabinet of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Refusing to give Diet testimony without a legitimate reason 
is punishable with a fine or imprisonment of up to one year by a 
two-thirds majority of committee members, according to Diet 
testimony law. 
  Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for 
his 
April 8 announcement of his resignation as prime minister. 
  Hosokawa's former financial secretary appeared before the 
budget panel Wednesday to say Hosokawa has indeed paid back a 
loan of 100 million yen borrowed in 1982 from the 
scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. 
  The secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, denied allegations that 
Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100 million yen loan and 
that it was received as a secret 
political donation.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's ruling coalition is headed for crucial reconciliation 
talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] 
which holds the key to the fate of his minority government. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said he will call on Hata, 
hopefully Wednesday [22 June], to discuss the SDP's policy 
platform, adopted late Tuesday, and the party's possible return 
to the ruling coalition. 
  The SDP, the second largest opposition party, will not 
submit 
a no-confidence vote during the course of talks, whose outcome 
should determine the survival of Hata's two-month-old cabinet, 
Murayama said. 
  Meanwhile, the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) decided the same day to formalize the party policy of 
submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after 
the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget clears the last Diet hurdle 
on Thursday. 
  With the opposition camp raising the ante through their 
political maneuvering, the ruling coalition extended its own 
overture to the SDP to rejoin their camp, officially proposing 
talks to the socialists. 
  The coalition is pinning hopes on its efforts to woo the SDP 
back into their group in order to defeat the LDP's planned 
no-confidence vote. 
  The SDP platform has been welcomed by both the ruling 
coalition and the LDP, which is seeking to create a stopgap 
cabinet with the SDP through early elections. 
  The SDP policy outline calls for making the policy-making 
process within the coalition more "democratic" and proposes a 
tax reform centered on raising indirect taxes. 
  The party stormed out of the ruling coalition in April in a 
row over a move by some coalition partners to create a new Diet 
bloc without the socialists, which the SDP viewed as an attempt 
to put them on the back-seat in policy making. 
  The outline also urges passage in the next Diet session of 
the bills for redrawing the electoral map for a new election 
system of single-seat constituencies combined with proportional 
representation for the House of Representatives, to replace the 
current multi-seat system. 
  Ruling coalition lawmakers immediately showed a readiness to 
embrace the SDP proposals. 
  "At first sight, there are no problems (with the platform)," 
said a top government official. 
  A senior official of Komeito [Clean Government Party], a key 
component of the coalition, concurred, saying, "the hurdles (for 
an agreement) are not high. The proposals show (the SDP) is 
seriously thinking about returning to the coalition." 
  The SDP's government blueprint also met a welcome from the 
LDP, which needs the socialists' support to pass the 
no-confidence vote. 
  "The contents (of the proposals) are nothing that we have to 
refuse at the negotiating table," a senior party policy maker 
said. 
  "No obstacles exist to our acceptance," another senior 
official said. 
  Even if the ruling coalition and the socialists agree to 
link 
up again, it remains unclear whether Hata will retain office due 
to disarray within the SDP. 
  SDP lawmakers who support Murayama called first for Hata's 
resignation, and a no-confidence motion if Hata should refuse 
the call. 
  On the other hand, SDP right-wingers led by Wataru Kubo, the 
party's secretary general, are placing top priority on a return 
to the ruling camp and are reluctant about demanding that Hata 
step down before the results of the realliance talks become 
clear.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The leadership of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan 
-- SDPJ] on Tuesday drew up a blueprint of a new coalition 
government on the premise that the coalition government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata resign voluntarily. 
  The blueprint said a new government, in which the SDP hopes 
to take part, should have a basic philosophy of democracy, 
freedom, fairness and peace based on respect for the 
Constitution. 
  A third coalition government must establish trustworthy 
relations among the coalition parties, it said, indirectly 
criticizing the formation in late April of a parliamentary group 
by other coalition partners excluding the SDP. 
  The SDP withdrew from the coalition following the formation, 
forcing Hata to form the first minority government in 39 years. 
  Basic policies of a new coalition government should be 
agreement among parties on the coalition governments of Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, it said. 
  As for tax system reform, the blueprint calls for abolition 
of the consumption tax and agrees to raise indirect tax to cope 
with the aging of society. It wants to enact bills for tax 
system reform by the end of the year. 
  The SDP urges the peaceful settlement of the North Korean 
nuclear issue by cooperating with the United States, South 
korea, China and Russia. 
  The plan also proposed setting up a council of Diet leaders 
and holding regular summit meetings of the parties to ensure 
transparency of decision-making procedures. 
  The SDP has said it will return to the ruling coalition if 
Hata and his cabinet ministers resign en masse voluntarily. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Monday his party will 
move to form a caretaker government with the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to oversee a general election if 
talks with the coalition fail. 
  The LDP plans to submit a no-confidence motion against the 
Hata cabinet after passage of the state budget for fiscal 1994, 
expected Thursday. If a no-confidence vote is approved, Hata 
must either dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap 
general election or disband his cabinet en masse.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- A government tax panel will 
issue a report Tuesday [21 June] proposing multiyear tax cuts 
and an offsetting consumption tax hike as the pillar of Japan's 
promised sweeping tax reform, sources close to the panel said 
Monday. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the tax commission, will hand the 
report over to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, leaving sufficient 
time for the government and the ruling coalition parties to 
detail the tax reform by the end of June and enact it into law 
by the year-end. 
  Japan promised the timetable in its March market-opening 
package. 
  But uncertainties are mounting politically, with the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party preparing to launch a 
no-confidence motion against the minority coalition government. 
  Kato has said the report will not include specific figures 
but it will call for a net revenue surplus from the tax cuts and 
hike to secure funds for welfare spending toward the 21st 
century because of Japan's "graying" society. 
  But he also suggested the report will show clear reasons for 
continuing the 6.2 trillion yen in income and other tax cuts 
already implemented this year, and for hiking the 3 percent 
consumption tax to 7 to 10 percent in April 1997. 
  The report will call for revamping both income and 
consumption tax systems to improve fairness and will urge the 
government to push forward fiscal and administrative overhauls 
to win public support on the tax reform, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato 
said TuesdayJapan's rice importation to make up for last year's 
poor domestic harvest will not reach the initially targeted 
level due to steady growth of the early crop. 
  Speaking at a press conference after a regular cabinet 
meeting, Kato said rice import contracts have been signed for a 
total of 2,545,000 tons so far and no more contracts will be 
concluded. 
  "We have secured the amount needed for (domestic) supply. 
And we have no import plans for this year," Kato said. 
  The Food Agency, which regulates rice production and 
distribution, was to import a total of some 2.66 million tons of 
rice to make up for the shortage caused by last year's poor 
harvest. 
  As for rice imports contracted so far, China was the biggest 
exporter with 1.07 million tons, followed by Thailand with 
753,000 tons, the United States with 537,000 tons and Australia 
with 183,000 tons. 
  Of these, 2.21 million tons were for table use, while the 
remainder were for processed foods. 
  In a related development, the food agency said Tuesday that 
short-and medium-grain rice mainly imported from the U.S. And 
China totaled 1.7 million tons of the 2.41 million tons of 
nonglutinous rice contracted for import. 
  Of the 1.7 million tons, 700,000 tons had been sold to 
wholesalers by June 16, the agency said. 
  Long-grain rice imported from Thailand, which turned out to 
be unpopular with Japanese people, who usually eat short- and 
medium- grain rice, totaled 710,000 tons, of which 420,000 tons 
have been sold. 
  With the agency now providing mainly short-and medium-grain 
rice to wholesalers, agency officials said they expect a 
stockpile of some 100,000 to 200,000 tons of long-grain rice by 
the end of October.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's economy has stopped 
weakening and is headed for recovery on the back of gradual 
recovery in personal consumption, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said 
Tuesday [21 June] in a monthly report on monetary and economic 
trends. 
  Among factors behind the central bank's views were strong 
investment in the housing and public sectors, bottoming out of 
industrial production and steady progress in inventory 
adjustment, as well as recovering personal consumption, the 
report said. 
  The report, however, noted corporate capital spending 
continues to decline in the manufacturing sector as a whole, 
while that in the nonmanufacturing sector remains stagnant. 
  In the labor market, growth in the number of employees 
continues to slow due to limited recruitment of new graduates, 
though the ratio of job offers to job applicants has stopped 
decreasing, the report said. 
  As to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the 
January-March quarter, just released by the Economic Planning 
Agency, Kagehide Kaku, research and statistics director at the 
central bank, told reporters the figures are within expectations 
and in line with the bank's judgments. 
  Asked about the possible impact of the yen's recent 
strengthening against the dollar on a burgeoning economic 
recovery, Kaku only said, "we are paying significant attention" 
to the yen's appreciation. 
  In this regard, Kaku reiterated the bank's view that the 
economy seems to have taken one step forward toward recovery, 
but ups and downs are expected amid remaining risks such as the 
yen's resurgence.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japanese companies 
continued to regain their business confidence in the April-June 
period by comparison with the preceding quarter, according to 
results of a survey released by the Finance Ministry on Tuesday 
[21 June]. 
  The business survey index (BSI) stood at minus 7.7 among 
major corporations, based on research conducted in May. The 
figure marks a 4.7 point improvement from the previous survey 
and the second quarter in a row that the sentiment has picked up. 
  The index is the difference of between the percentages of 
those saying conditions have improved and those claiming it has 
not. 
  A Finance Ministry official said he expects further 
improvement in the future. 
  The survey found that business confidence among small and 
medium-sized companies is also growing. 
  Major companies' expectations for the July-September period 
yield a positive index of 0.2, while those of medium-sized firms 
give a positive index of 1.9 for the final quarter this year. 
  Companies expected an average 1.7 percent increase of sales 
in fiscal 1994 and a 16.0 percent rise of pretax profit. 
  The survey also showed the labor surplus easing for the 
first 
time since February 1991. 
  The research covered 10,816 companies capitalized at 10 
million yen or more, excluding financial institutions and 
insurance concerns. Valid responses were received from 9,187 
firms.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's economy grew a real 
1.0 percent in the first quarter this year from the last three 
months of 1993, or at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, the 
Economic Planning Agency said in a preliminary report Tuesday. 
  Domestic demand accounted for 0.8 percent of the inflation- 
adjusted growth of the gross domestic product (GDP), while 
external demand contributed 0.2 percent. 
  Consumer spending gained 1.4 percent in the first three 
months of this year, while corporate plant and equipment 
investment declined 1.0 percent. 
  The real gross national product (GNP) in the same quarter 
expanded by 0.8 percent from the preceding three months, or an 
annualized 3.3 percent. 
  GDP and GNP are the total output of goods and services, with 
GDP excluding net income from overseas. 
  Meanwhile, Japan's GDP in fiscal 1993 that ended March 31 
remained unchanged from the previous year in real terms, while 
the real GNP decreased 0.1 percent. 
  Of the 1.0 percent growth for the first quarter, domestic 
demand accounted for 0.8 percent, while external demand 
contributed 0.2 percent. 
  The GDP sank 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
  Consumption further gained 1.4 percent, compared with a 0.7 
percent rise in the previous quarter, while plant and equipment 
spending declined 1.0 percent but improved from a negative 3.8 
percent in the October-December period. 
  Active government spending in line with pump-priming 
packages 
helped consolidate the upward move, the EPA [Economic Planning 
Agency] said. 
  The real gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter 
rose an annualized 3.3 percent. Of the data representing the 
total output of goods and services, GDP excludes income from 
overseas. 
  For fiscal 1993, figures released simultaneously showed that 
the GDP growth remained flat, or only fractionally on the plus 
side of 0.03 percent. 
  The 0.0 percent performance was the weakest since the 
negative performance of 0.03 percent posted in fiscal 1974. 
  On a GNP basis, the fiscal 1993 economy shrank 0.1 percent. 
  Returning to the GDP, the government said that as a result 
of 
the fiscal 1993 showing, the current fiscal year will 
technicallly see a 0.4 percent growth even if all the quarters 
post zero expansion. 
  It said, however, an average 0.77 percent, or an annualized 
3.12 percent, growth is necessary in each quarter in the current 
fiscal year to accomplish the official forecast of a 2.4 percent 
expansion. 
  Private economists agree with optimistic remarks by the 
EPA's 
Tanaka, saying it looks like Japan is beginning to prepare for a 
major recovery. 
  "I think the fiscal year-end factor and a reaction to the 
contraction in the fourth quarter of 1993 combined to boost the 
figure for the January-March quarter," said Atsushi Miyawaki, a 
senior economist at Japan Research Institute. 
  "But generally speaking, Japan appears on the verge of an 
upward swing," he added. 
  Bank of Tokyo analyst Yozo Nishimura said conditions have 
considerably improved and that a substantial revival can be 
expected in fiscal 1995 after a gradual recovery in the current 
fiscal year. 
  But Miyawaki said there is still a possibility of negative 
growth in the April-June period in reaction to the healthy 
first-quarter performance. 
  Personal income remains sluggish, he noted, and the major 
focus will be whether the effects of the summer income tax cuts 
will persist in the following months. 
  Nishimura was a bit more optimistic and expected flat growth 
as the worst case for the April-June period. 
  "The risk factor is the effect of the appreciation of the 
yen 
against the dollar, which could throw cold water on buoyant 
export activities," he said. 
  Economists estimate Japanese exporters have their 
boom-or-bust rate set at 105 yen to the dollar.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japanese corporate earnings 
showed bright signs in the January-March quarter with sales 
rebounding and profits and capital investment slowing their 
declines, the Finance Ministry reported Friday [17 June]. 
  A ministry official, briefing reporters, said the quarterly 
business survey indicated "signs of a gradually recovering 
economy." 
  The survey covered 23,053 companies capitalized at 10 
million 
yen and more, and excluding financial institutions and insurance 
companies. The number of respondents came to 19,366 companies, 
or 84.0 percent. 
  Combined pretax profits for the quarter fell 5.8 percent 
from 
the previous year posting the 15th consecutive decline, but the 
yearly decline slowed from the October-December quarter's 6.2 
percent and the July-September period's 21.6 percent, the report 
said. 
  Sales rose 0.8 percent after falling for seven quarters in a 
row as sales of non-manufacturers rose 3.0 percent after 
declining for six straight quarters. 
  Capital investment shrank 11.7 percent for the ninth 
straight 
decline, but the rate of decline slowed from the previous 
quarter's 16.8 percent and the July-September period's 15.8 
percent. 
  In reflection of improving earnings, the officials noted 
progress in inventory adjustments as capital stocks at 
manufacturers rose a scant 0.8 percent compared with a 2.8 
percent gain in the previous quarter. 
  The official said, "recovering domestic demand is apparently 
starting to contribute to corporate earnings." 
  Manufacturers saw their pretax profits fall 12.2 percent on 
4.4 percent lower sales, improving from the previous quarter's 
16.5 percent drop in profits and 4.5 percent decline in sales. 
  The official said the improvements reflected their 
cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts. 
  For non-manufacturers, pretax profits fell back 1.9 percent 
from a 3.9 percent rise in the previous quarter, despite the 
rebound in sales. 
  The official attributed the profit decline to falling prices 
at the wholesale level amid a discount trend among consumers. 
But he said the trend was yet not evident at the retail level. 
  On an industry basis, pretax profits jumped 108.3 percent 
among food makers, reflecting improved consumption, and 8.9 
percent among petroleum product makers thanks to lower crude oil 
prices on the higher yen. 
  Electric machinery and equipment makers enjoyed a 13.3 
percent rise on buoyant demand for semiconductor devices at home 
and abroad and for household appliances from continued strong 
housing investment. 
  Also buoyed by housing spending, construction firms saw a 
4.4 
percent rise in their pretax profits, and real estate firms were 
4 billion yen in the black from the previous quarter's pretax 
losses of 133.1 billion yen. 
  Steel Makers suffered 123.8 percent lower profits, and 
wholesalers and retailers faced a combined decline of 16.7 
percent. 
  Capital investment by manufacturers fell 20.6 percent, 
almost 
unchanged from the previous month's 20.0 percent drop, and that 
by non-manufacturers improved to a 7.4 percent decline compared 
with the previous decline of 15.2 percent. 
  The official said bright signs were seen among 
manufacturers, 
with a 2.2 percent rise in capital investment by electric 
machinery and equipment makers after eight consecutive quarters 
of decline.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan's benchmark money 
supply grew 1.7 percent in May from a year before, slowing down 
from a 2.2 percent rise in April, the Bank of japan said Friday 
[17 June]. 
  That brought the widely watched measure of money supply -- 
cash in circulation, time and demand deposits, plus certificates 
of deposit (CDs) -- to 518.0 trillion yen, the central bank said 
in a preliminary report. 
  The broad measure of liquidity, including postal savings, 
government debts and investment trusts, rose 3.2 percent from a 
year before, compared with the 3.3 percent rise in April, the 
report said. 
  The lower key money supply growth in May was a reaction to 
the jump from a 0.5 percent year-to-year rise in April last year 
to a 1.5 percent yearly gain in May 1993, which was due to 
sluggish tax collection under the economic slowdown, said Kengo 
Inoue, research and statistics deputy director at the central 
bank. 
  The basic trend of slow growth in money supply remained 
unchanged in May and will continue in June, Inoue told reporters. 
  No factors have emerged that would revise largely either 
upward or downward the central bank's forecast for the 
April-June quarter of the 1 percent level growth from year 
earlier levels, he said. 
  Within the money supply figures, time and savings deposits 
rose 1.1 percent in May from a year before, compared with the 
1.2 percent gain in April. 
  CDs fell for the fifth straight month, declining 18.2 
percent 
from a year before after the 8.8 percent yearly fall in April. 
  Inoue attributed the expanding fall in CDs mainly to fewer 
issuances by financial institutions as their reserve positions 
have improved. 
  The 18.2 percent year-to-year decline was the biggest since 
March 1992, when CDs dropped 19.0 percent from a year earlier, 
he said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic 
Party (DP) voiced optimism Monday that the inter-Korean summit 
would be realized at an early date after ministerial-level 
working contacts in June or July. 
  The party's planning and management section submitted a 
report on the current political situation to the Supreme Council 
stating that since the inter-Korean summit has been agreed in 
principle by both sides' presidents, it is likely that 
procedures for the summit will progress rapidly. 
  "If South and North Korea broad-mindedly push for the 
summit, 
it is highly likely that all the procedures for realization of 
the summit may make rapid progress," the report said. 
  North Korean leader Kim Il-song has conveyed his hope to 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam of an early summit "at any 
time, any place and without any preconditions" through former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Kim Yong-sam in turn welcomed the 
offer. 
  It added that the ministerial-level working contacts for the 
summit would probably be held in June or July and that the 
summit could occur this year -- that is, if things go well and 
if North Korean-U.S. talks also make progress. 
  Considering the historical significance of the first 
inter-Korean summit, the two sides are expected to meet in Seoul 
and Pyongyang, according to the report. 
  The summit is expected to address all issues pending between 
South and North Korea including the standoff over Pyongyang's 
nuclear program. 
  "Especially, the meeting will deal with the two basic 
agreements concluded at the sixth high-level inter-Korean talks 
in February 1992 -- the South-North denuclearization 
declaration, disarmament and unification," the report predicted. 
  The report said the summit's chances of coming off are good, 
citing the former U.S. President's mediation between the two 
sides and both presidents' emphasis on meeting without any 
preconditions. 
  Both Seoul and Pyongyang are in a difficult situation 
because 
of the nuclear dispute, the report pointed out, and the 
agreement to hold a summit was made with the world closely 
watching, the report added. 
  "The inter-Korean summit will act as great momentum to 
change 
overall inter-Korean relations, including the North Korean 
nuclear situation, and to clear away the national history of 
hostility and antagonism over the past 50 years." 
  The report suggested that the DP actively support the 
government so that the mood can change from sanctions to 
dialogue and so inter-Korean relations can be normalized.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic 
Party (DP) proposed Monday to form a joint standing preparation 
body with the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) to ensure 
supra-partisan support for an inter-Korean summit. 
  The party's Supreme Council met Monday morning, under the 
presidency of Chairman Yi Ki-taek, and made the proposal after 
agreeing that the inter-Korean summit requires perfect 
preparations since it presents a historic chance to deal with 
various national issues including unification and the nuclear 
problem. 
  Members of the supreme committee also decided to form 
another 
organization inside the party to study details of the summit 
including its agenda. 
  North Korean strongman Kim Il-song, speaking through former 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has expressed his desire to meet 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam for an early summit "at any 
time, any place and without any preconditions." The South's 
leader has welcomed the offer. 
  The opposition party plans to seek an extraordinary session 
of the National Assembly to discuss the North Korean nuclear 
problem and the Seoul-Pyongyang summit. 
  Chairman Yi said before the meeting, "There is no need for 
me 
to visit North Korea ahead of President Kim Yong-sam if the 
inter-Korean summit is pushed ahead with smoothly." 
  North Korea said recently that it would welcome a visit by 
Yi.

  [Text] Seoul, June 21 (YONHAP) -- The government is pushing 
to hold the proposed inter-Korean summit by mid-July after 
completing preliminary contacts between the two sides' deputy 
premiers by early next month. 
  Responding to the offer of an unconditional summit made by 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song, a government official said 
Tuesday that the two sides will meet beforehand to schedule the 
summit for July in Seoul or Pyongyang, or a third place named by 
North Korea. He added, however, that contacts with Pyongyang 
will follow Seoul's judgement that North Korea is sincere about 
the summit. 
  The summit's success or failure is totally up to the North 
Koreans despite varying internal and international conditions, 
he stressed, forecasting the meeting would be held in July if 
North Korea showed sincerity. 
  Meanwhile, the government plans to accept any change of date 
for the preliminary contacts if North Korea counterproposes a 
date that is within one week of June 28, the date proposed by 
Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. 
  If North Korea launches another political offensive, such as 
the 10-point program adopted by its Supreme People's Council on 
April 7 last year, the government will stop seeking a summit and 
instead intensify its efforts to secure a UN resolution imposing 
sanctions on the North. 
  Earlier Tuesday, Deputy Premier and National Unification 
Minister Yi Hong-ku met with senior presidential secretary for 
foreign and national security affairs Chong Jong-uk to discuss 
preparations for the preliminary contacts.

  [Text] It was learned that most of our people think that 
North Korea's true intention for proposing a North-South summit 
is aimed at getting out of the present crisis and that it would 
be very difficult to hold a summit. However, they absolutely 
support a North-South summit. 
  The result of a telephone poll conducted by Media 
Research--a 
public opinion survey organization--among 1,000 men and women 
above the age of 20 throughout the country, except Cheju Island, 
showed that concerning the true intention of North Korean 
President Kim Il-song for proposing a North-South summit, 76.3 
percent of the respondents said his proposal is a one-time 
[ilsijogin] proposal aimed at getting out of the present crisis, 
including sanctions against North Korea. 
  Regarding the possibility of the actual holding of a 
North-South summit, 50.8 percent, over half of all of the 
respondents, gave a negative reply. In particular, 64.7 percent, 
the absolute majority, responded that UN sanctions against North 
Korea should be continually pushed ahead. Thus, a considerable 
number of people showed a wait-and-see position on the summit. 
  Meanwhile, concerning the holding of a North-South summit 
itself, 92.8 percent, the absolute majority of the respondents, 
support the holding of the summit, and 65.7 percent assessed 
that the North-South summit would bring about positive results 
for a solution to the nuclear problem and for attaining 
cooperative relations between the North and the South. Moreover, 
56.1 percent of respondents replied that the summit would make 
positive contributions to the issue of national reunification, 
thus showing considerable expectations for the North-South 
summit.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Hans Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has expressed the hope that former 
U.S. President Carter's visit to the North will serve as a 
turning point and a climate will be fostered in which North 
Korea will completely return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and comply with the nuclear accord. 
  Director General Hans Blix said this in an exclusive 
interview with the KBS network on 17 June. 
  He said he welcomed the promise North Korea has made to 
former President Carter that it will allow the inspectors who 
are now in Yongbyon to approach nuclear facilities without 
restricting their activities. 
  Director General Hans Blix said, in particular, with regard 
to North Korea's replacement of nuclear fuel rods: At present, 
the five-megawatt atomic reactor is empty because its fuel rods 
have been removed. It seems that new fuel rods will be 
installed soon. 
  He said: The inspectors in Yongbyon have been conducting 
various kinds of inspection activities, including installing 
monitoring equipment at the storage site of spent fuel rods and 
at reprocessing facilities without any restrictions. The 
inspectors work at any time and take turns working. 
  Asked if he would be willing to have dialogue with North 
Korea, Director General Hans Blix emphasized that his duty is to 
inspect if activities comply with the nuclear accord, adding 
that the United States will discuss issues, including the 
normalization of relations, with North Korea through political 
dialogue.

<F P=106> [Interview with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu </F>
by Katarzyna Kolodziejczyk; place and date not given: 
"Irrational Partner" -- questions published in boldface] 
  [Text] [Kolodziejczyk] How serious, in political and 
military terms, is the situation on the Korean peninsula? 
  [Han Sung-chu] The situation is no more dangerous that it 
was before. Of course, considerable forces on both sides -- 
North and South Korea -- are still facing each other. However, 
since the day the nuclear crisis began, we have not observed any 
extraordinary movements by the North Korean Army. Thus, we have 
no reason to expect any provocation on their part right now. 
Therefore, on the 15th day of this month, just as in any month, 
routine civil defense exercises were organized, the only 
difference being that this time they were held nationwide. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] How do you think the situation will develop? 
  [Han Sung-chu] The development of the situation will now 
depend on what steps are taken by the UN Security Council over 
the next two or three months. During this time, a decision will 
be made as to whether the Security Council will pass resolutions 
concerning North Korea, and if so, when. There is a certain 
hope that the North will nonetheless continue its cooperation 
with international organizations and other states. Even though 
it left the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it did 
not expel the UN inspectors, who were sent to control its 
nuclear program there. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] In such a situation, is the South Korean 
Government going to focus its efforts on strengthening its own 
defense capabilities, that is, military capabilities, or will it 
focus on possibilities for resolving the crisis through peaceful 
means? 
  [Han Sung-chu] I consider it vital and indispensable to act 
in both directions. Of course, our primary intention is to 
maintain the peace; however, we can see the poor results of our 
talks, including those initiated by the Security Council. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] If the North had so desired, it could have 
seriously threatened South Korea much earlier, with its 
short-and medium-range missiles, by destroying your nuclear 
power plants and some of your military equipment. However, this 
is not what happened. What are the reasons, then, that the 
North's holding of these weapons is seen as so dangerous? 
  [Han Sung-chu] There are at least three reasons why nuclear 
weapons in the hands of North Korea constitute a real threat. 
  First, because we are dealing with a regime that is very 
reckless and determined, if not unpredictable. For this reason 
alone we cannot rule out the possibility of the North's 
employing nuclear weapons -- if it had such weapons at its 
disposal. 
  Second, even if they do not actually use the weapons, they 
may use them for blackmailing purposes -- not only us, but 
neighboring states as well; they would also be fully aware of 
the fact that this would entail destroying their entire system 
and themselves as well. At the same time, the possibility of a 
provocation through the use of conventional means has increased, 
which is a very important issue. 
  Third, if nuclear weapons were manufactured in the North, 
there would arise the very important problem of nuclear 
proliferation. Not only in our region, but across the world. In 
other words, we would witness a threat not only in the region, 
but also in the world; I must admit, though, that for us this 
threat is more acute than for the rest of the world. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Do you not think that direct talks between 
the North and the South in the first phase of the crisis would 
be a much quicker and more effective method of resolving this 
problem, as opposed to third countries getting involved? 
  [Han Sung-chu] We have always advocated dialogue with 
North Korea. As is known, we even reached some kind of an 
agreement with them in the talks in the autumn of 1992; those 
talks concerned, among other issues, the nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons. We also established a joint committee. 
Unfortunately, North Korea has so far not wanted to hold any 
further negotiations with us. It does insist, however, on 
direct dialogue with the United States. Now that it has 
withdrawn from the IAEA, it does not want to talk with them 
either. I would like to offer assurances that as far as we are 
concerned, we have done as much as possible, and will do as much 
as possible in the future to find a resolution to this problem 
through dialogue. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Why do you think the North has been avoiding 
direct talks with the South? 
  [Han Sung-chu] I think they are afraid of the Berlin Wall 
syndrome. That is, they are afraid that talks with us, or any 
contacts, including exchanges, might encroach considerably on 
their system. This, in turn, might cause consequences similar 
to those triggered by the collapse of the Berlin Wall. In such 
a situation, both North Korea's system and representatives would 
lose the justification for their continued political existence. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Some oppositional parties in your country 
claim that the position of the United States on the issue of 
controlling the North's nuclear program was considerably 
exaggerated. These circles suppose that in the context of the 
current nuclear crisis, the interests of South Korea may not be 
identical with those of the United States. 
  [Han Sung-chu] This supposition is totally contrary to 
reality. The patient and systematic policy of the United 
States, the policy of constantly persuading North Korea to agree 
to hold talks, refutes this opinion. Two rounds of talks have 
already been held. If the North wanted, it could certainly, and 
easily, meet the conditions, which, in turn, would be the 
foundation of serious political dialogue. In the meantime, this 
country ruined the foundations of such a dialogue by withdrawing 
from the IAEA. 
  Now, the criticism of the U.S. stand has its origins, first 
of all, in the United States itself. The opposition in the 
United States is not unanimous on this issue, not to mention 
that some of Bill Clinton's policy statements concerning the 
Korean crisis are far less critical than some people would like 
them to be. For the sake of clarity, I would like to add that 
the policy of our government concerning this issue is the same 
as the policy of the United States. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Some political observers have suggested that 
the goal of the mission by former President Carter was to 
persuade the North to give up its nuclear program in exchange 
for diplomatic recognition by the United States, in particular. 
Would your government be willing to reach a compromise on this 
issue? 
  [Han Sung-chu] Jimmy Carter did not go to Pyongyang to 
negotiate anything, and certainly not the issue of North Korea's 
return to the international political scene. However, we will 
very seriously consider every suggestion that Carter brings back 
with him. I would like to stress, however, that any suggestion 
on the part of North Korea should be of a more formal nature. 
We must be certain of what is going on; we must also be sure of 
the intentions of any possible proposals. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] What is your evaluation of the stand taken 
by China? This country has clearly stated that it does not 
accept any sanctions directed against the North. 
  [Han Sung-chu] China has played a very serious role in this 
crisis. So far the role has been rather constructive. China 
has stated quite unequivocally that it is against the nuclear 
program of the North; it tried its own methods to persuade the 
North to conduct a dialogue and, first of all, maintain the 
clarity of the nuclear program. I think that at the forum of 
the UN Security Council -- the issue of the resolution is still 
open -- China's stand will depend on how North Korea responds to 
the international actions. If the North is inclined to 
cooperate, then I believe there will be no reason for the 
Security Council to pass any resolutions. However, if the North 
rejects such a possibility, then I believe China will not be 
able to continue supporting North Korea at such an important 
forum. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Would your government accept the concept 
of an international conference addressing the situation on the 
Korean Peninsula, as was once proposed by Russia? 
  [Han Sung-chu] On principle we are not against multilateral 
talks; however, we doubt the usefulness of such talks if North 
Korea does not agree to satisfy the fundamental conditions of 
the dialogue. This is why we are skeptical about the idea of 
holding such a conference. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] What is your evaluation of Japan's position 
on the Korean crisis? As is known, many Korean workers in Japan 
have family in North Korea. 
  [Han Sung-chu] It must be admitted that Japan was very upset 
by the present situation. We have close relations with this 
country which make it possible for us to hold constant 
consultations among the three states: our country, the United 
States, and Japan. This country has so far consistently 
supported the idea of the Security Council's passing a 
resolution if North Korea continues to refuse to cooperate with 
the international body. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] In the situation that has developed now, has 
the idea of uniting both Koreas become far more remote, or is it 
the other way around? 
  [Han Sung-chu] It is difficult to say anything about it. A 
similar situation was observed after the collapse of the Berlin 
Wall. At that time, no one was able to predict that the 
unification of Germany would come almost automatically after the 
first breaches of the Berlin Wall were made. Thus, we cannot 
say anything specific on this issue as well. Some people think 
that the unification of both Koreas will occur next year, others 
-- in two years' time... 
  [Kolodziejczyk] North Korea is to a considerable degree 
isolated from the rest of the world. Do the government and 
people of South Korea know how their countrymen on the other 
side of the 38th parallel are living? Do they know, for 
instance, whether -- just as in South -- they want to unite, 
and, if it came to an open conflict, whether they would shoot at 
their countrymen from the South? 
  [Han Sung-chu] Well, they have already done this. The 
Korean war in 1950 cost both sides a lot of blood. However, 
almost 40 years have passed since that time and the situation in 
the world has changed dramatically. For example, there is no 
longer any Soviet Union. Today the North -- unlike the South -- 
is experiencing a difficult economic situation. Apart from 
that, our defense capabilities in the South are so great today 
that they would have to act irrationally and be totally 
desperate to attempt any provocation against us. 
  However, it is true that we simply do not know many details 
of the lives of our countrymen in the North. Generally, we know 
as much as the world does -- that the people complain about 
living standards -- and we know the methods by which the 
authorities manage the economy. I believe, however, that the 
North Koreans know something; they secretly listen to our radio 
broadcasts... Even the most closed society is not totally 
hermetic, not to say watertight. I think that the Koreans from 
the North realize the differences between themselves and the 
rest of the world.

  [Text] Washington, June 17 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, referring to former President Jimmy 
Carter's reported statement that Washington has suspended its 
bid to apply sanctions against North Korea, said Friday "it is 
different" from Washington's official position. 
  A high-ranking official at the South Korean Embassy in 
Washington disclosed that Christopher conveyed the U.S. 
Government's position to the South Korean Government through 
Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord. 
  Christopher said the United States would continue 
consultations on sanctions against Pyongyang at the U.N. 
Security Council until it became apparent that North Korea had 
frozen its nuclear development program. 
  Meanwhile, South Korean Ambassador to Washington Han Sung-su 
met with Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci to 
exchange views on American policy toward North Korea, which 
seems muddled after Carter's recent statement in Pyongyang. 
  At the meeting, Gallucci was quoted by the high-ranking 
official as stressing that "Carter's statement in Pyongyang is 
not the official position of America."

  [Text] Seoul, June 21 (YONHAP) -- Ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party [DLP] Chairman Kim Chong-pil, while disputing former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter's view of North Korea, stressed on 
Tuesday there should be no relaxation of vigilance over North 
Korea until the nuclear issue is resolved. 
  In a lecture at a DLP training session held at the Veterans 
Association Building in eastern Seoul, Kim belittled a set of 
North Korean offers made during Carter's visit to North Korea. 
  "Mr. Carter is saying the North Korean offer for reduction 
of the two sides' Armed Forces to the 100,000-man level is 
reasonable, but this is no more than the repetition of what Kim 
Il-song has been voicing since long ago," he said. 
  Kim said he was stunned to hear Carter say "Kim Il-song is 
reasonable, honest and enjoying people's trust." 
  "That naive man, it seems, was duped in many ways in North 
Korea," he said. 
  Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, too, said at 
the session that Kim Il-song is waging a time-earning tactic by 
inviting Carter in a move to escape international sanctions. 
  "Kim Il-song likes Carter very much because he promoted the 
withdrawal of American forces from Korea immediately after the 
fall of South Vietnam," Yi said.

  [Text] A diplomatic source in Seoul said on 20 June that 
the ROK Government would propose to the United States that 
before the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks 
takes place, dialogue between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] resume and that negotiations for 
special inspections of the two unreported nuclear facilities 
start. 
  He also said that he knew that the United States informed 
the 
ROK that it plans to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korea 
high-level talks at an early date if, at a U.S.-North Korea 
working-level contact in New York, North Korea makes assurances 
for ensuring the continuity of IAEA nuclear safeguards, 
including a ban on refueling the five-megawatt nuclear reactor 
in Yongbyon, a ban on reprocessing the discharged spent nuclear 
fuel, and permission for the IAEA inspectors now staying in 
North Korea to continue their work. 
  On the morning of 20 June, the Unification and Security 
Policy Coordination Council reportedly held extensive discussion 
on this issue. Also, the meeting reportedly pointed out that it 
is necessary to hold North-South summit talks to hold in check 
the "unilateral holding of U.S.-North Korea dialogue."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Son Ki-yong] </F>
  [Text] With the United States and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) welcoming North Korea's new overture, South 
Korea reacted cautiously, apparently concerned that the last 
chance to clear up suspicion over the North Korean nuclear 
program might be lost due to Pyongyang's still ambiguous 
commitment to nuclear transparency. 
  "The government's official position on the new development 
will be set tomorrow (June 18) after Carter briefs President Kim 
Yong-sam on the outcome of his trip to North Korea," a spokesman 
told reporters following an early morning session of the 
Coordination Committee for Unification and Security Policies. 
  North Korean leader Kim Il-song hinted at the possibility of 
the North committing to its nuclear transparency during talks 
with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton expressed willingness to resume dialogue with Pyongyang 
if it freezes its nuclear program. 
  Seoul's nuclear policymakers appear to be perplexed over 
Pyongyang's sudden overture and Washington's positive reaction 
and initially took a wait-and-see approach to the new 
development. 
  So far, South Korea has ruled out any dialogue with North 
Korea unless Pyongyang first takes constructive action leading 
to the clarification of all suspicion of its nuclear weapons 
program. 
  Shifting into a hardline stance with threats of sanctions, 
the Seoul government wanted North Korea's complete compliance 
with the international community's call for nuclear transparency. 
  Even though it would contribute to reducing tension on the 
Korean peninsula, the resumption of dialogue, which comes 
without a firm North Korean commitment, will only prolong the 
current nuclear impasse, officials have said. 
  "We will watch developments. We will hold further 
consultations with the United States after receiving Carter's 
briefing on the outcome of his visit to the North," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. 
  "We are not in the process of resuming dialogue with the 
North. We are still pushing ahead with a plan to seek U.N. 
sanctions against North Korea," he added. 
  Chang said that the government will push the two-pronged 
strategy combining sanctions with dialogue for the time being. 
  The spokesman revealed that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu 
had 
telephone conversations with U.S. Security of State Warren 
Christopher three times early yesterday morning, turning up [as 
published] the wording of a statement issued by U.S. Assistant 
Security of State Robert Gallucci. 
  "Through the telephone talks, the government's position was 
included in the statement," he added. 
  The statement said that the United States is ready to engage 
in a third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks under 
proper circumstances. 
  However, he refused to comment on the timing of a third 
round 
of talks, saying that "the statement reaffirms the basic 
positions for a third round of talks by South Korea and the 
United States." 
  In May, the United States tried to resume the high-level 
talks because North Korea agreed to additional inspections of 
its nuclear facilities. But the North's replacement of spent 
fuel rods at a five-megawatt reactor without international 
monitoring raises tension and the United States declared that 
the basis for dialogue had crumbled. 
  When asked about what would be a new basis for the 
high-level 
talks, Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin said that there 
should be "arrangements for special inspections" before the 
high-level talks are held. 
  After the replacement of fuel rods which virtually crushed 
the possibility of tracing the exact amount of plutonium 
possessed by Pyongyang, South Korea and the United States have 
demanded that North Korea accept special inspections and 
voluntarily disclose its nuclear-related activities. 
  Meanwhile, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said that it is 
noteworthy that North Korea indicated its intention of accepting 
special inspections at its two undeclared nuclear sites for the 
first time. 
  North Korea has so far refused to accept inspections at the 
two facilities, believed to be nuclear waste storage, claiming 
that they are "military facilities."

  [Text] Moscow, June 21 (YONHAP) -- Russia's state Duma 
(house of representatives) held a meeting Monday to discuss the 
Russian Government's position on possible international 
sanctions against North Korea. 
  Russian Vice Foreign Minister Alexandr Panov explained the 
government's position at the closed-door meeting, 
unprecedentedly attended by North Korean Ambassador to Moscow 
Son Song-pil. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, 
said Russia should cooperate closely with the United States on 
sanctions against North Korea, adding that it is unclear if 
Pyongyang plans to bargain for more favorable conditions or is 
simply playing for time, diplomatic sources said. 
  Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry officials support an 
inter-Korean summit in principle. They welcomed the possible 
continuation of dialogue as international sanctions against the 
communist state are being discussed in detail. 
  But the current situation on the Korean peninsula has 
neither 
improved nor worsened, the officials added.

<F P=106> [Article by Nam Yu-chol: "Even Limited Sanctions Can Cause </F>
Serious Damage to North Korea--Economic Sanctions, Effective 
Even Without Chinese Participation--Suspension of Inter-Korean 
Trade Also Deals the North a Blow"] 
  [Text] The North Korean military delegation led by Choe 
Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean People's 
Army [KPA], recently visited China to hold a series of talks 
with the Chinese leaders. The visit, which was made at a 
delicate time when the United Nations was discussing economic 
sanctions on North Korea, drew extraordinary attention at home 
and abroad. As to Choe Kwang's China visit, which was different 
from the courtesy visits by the North Korean leadership, the 
local experts had a more-or-less vague assessment that North 
Korea may have wanted to maintain a close military cooperation 
with China while international tension was increasing. The head 
of the North Korean department of a major business group, who is 
well versed in North Korean affairs, said, "We understand that 
the two sides had an extensive exchange of views over the 
pending issues between the two countries regarding the nuclear 
issue." 
  Choe Kwang is a person who is regarded as the No. 2 man in 
the North Korean military, whose position is to take the whole 
responsibility for military operations under the KPA supreme 
commander Kim Chong-il. In particular, he has been directly 
involved in purchasing the oil for military use, which is "the 
most important job" of the North Korean military. The sources 
of information of the Singaporean oil market, who are well 
versed in the oil supply of the Asian countries, have watched 
with interest Choe Kwang's moves over the last several years. 
The reason is that whenever Choe Kwang conducted "military 
diplomacy" with Iran and Southeast Asia, there was talk about 
oil supply for North Korea. 
  A bigwig inter-Korean trade agent in Singapore keeping in 
touch with the North Korean leadership said in an interview: "It 
is certain that Choe Kwang discussed with China the problem of 
oil supply for the military." Another trade agent, who supplied 
Russian oil to North Korea through a Chinese intermediary, said 
that the North Korean military purchased oil for itself through 
independent channels different from those of the party and the 
Administration Council. The purpose of Choe Kwang's visit to 
China is considered to include the problem of oil supply in 
preparation for wartime. 
  That the North Korean military purchased oil independently 
through various channels was an object of major concern to the 
local strategic experts. We are greatly interested in how much 
oil North Korea has been stockpiling for military use. Local 
experts estimate that North Korea must be stockpiling oil for 
military use that will last for one year in preparation for war, 
despite its severe oil shortage. However, according to the 
Southeast Asian oil sources, North Korea failed to sign a 
satisfactory oil supply contract not only with Iran but with 
Indonesia, with which North Korea persistently contracted in 
1993. 
  A U.S. oil expert demanding anonymity, in a telephone 
interview, said: "The oil the allied forces spent during the 
Gulf war was 300,000 barrels per day. North Korea may not have 
even the minimum stockpile it needs." (Al Troner), Singapore 
branch head of the U.S. oil journal PETROLEUM INTELLIGENCE 
WEEKLY, said: "I have not heard that North Korea is trying to 
purchase oil from an oil market." 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher revealed that 
economic sanctions against North Korea must, first of all, block 
the incoming flow of petroleum and foodstuffs. Most of the 
domestic experts have been showing skepticism by saying that 
there will be no effect in the economic sanctions against the 
North if China, which is providing petroleum and foodstuffs to 
North Korea, does not take part in the sanctions. The analysis 
that China holds the key to economic sanctions against the North 
is only based on government statistics by countries exchanging 
trade with North Korea such as China and Russia. Therefore, it 
is a mistake to have overestimated the "influence" China has in 
the North Korean overall trade. 
  An expert in North Korean affairs from a private economic 
institute claimed: "Even if limited sanctions are taken against 
the North, they would be a big blow to the North Korean economy, 
which has been recording a negative growth for the past four 
years." He also said: "It has been known that the practical 
effectiveness of the economic sanctions against the North would 
depend on China's attitude. However, even if China does not 
participate in taking sanctions against the North, the 
effectiveness of the sanctions against the North would be 
great." As a basis for this, he pointed out that the ROK and 
Japan are important countries in earning foreign currency, and 
equipment and materials for heavy industry facilities in 
exporting North Korean weapons are from eastern Germany and 
Russia. Therefore, when it becomes impossible to change 
facilities, North Korea will suffer an enormous blow. 
  According to statistics by the PRC Customs and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, North 
Korea imported 649,000 tonnes of grain from China and 177,000 
tonnes of grain from Turkey in 1992. It is not in the 
statistics, but from 1991 to 1993, North Korea imported a large 
amount of Canadian and Australian grain through a trading 
company in New Jersey, United States. In September 1992, after 
concluding a contract under the name of a third country's 
company, North Korea brought in 70,000 tonnes of wheat from 
Australia. In January 1993, 280,000 tonnes of wheat were 
exported to North Korea from western Canada, and 30,966 tonnes 
and 25,000 tonnes were exported to North Korea in February, and 
March, respectively. These were not listed in the statistics of 
the governments of various countries because companies of 
various nationalities were involved in the purchase, shipping, 
and transportation. 
  According to North Korea's 1993 economic index as announced 
by the Korea Bank, North Korea's GNP was $25 billion. Among the 
$25 billion, the total amount of trade was $2.64 billion 
occupying only 12.9 percent of the total GNP. (When considering 
official statistics that can be tallied), North Korea imported 
goods from China (34.8 percent), Japan (14.3 percent), and CIS 
(14.6 percent) in 1992. Also 58.2 percent of the overall export 
was to these three countries. The Institute of Foreign Affairs 
and National Security analyzed: "Economic sanctions against the 
North would have a great effect if economic sanctions are taken 
against the North internationally, because imports and exports 
are concentrated on these countries." 
  U.S. economist (Gerry Hufbower's) studies show that a mere 
36 percent of the 103 instances of economic sanctions imposed 
from 1914 to 1983 were successful. However, the effect of 
economic sanctions is a relative concept. The meaning of 
"effect" will change depending on what political purposes to 
pursue in economic sanctions. Therefore, the political purposes 
of sanctions on North Korea must be clarified before the effect 
of such sanctions is discussed. It is not clear at present 
whether economic sanctions on North Korea are intended for the 
eventual collapse of the North Korean establishment or whether 
they are part of an attempt to pressure North Korea into another 
round of negotiations to prevent North Korea from developing 
nuclear weapons. 
  Countries involved in sanctions on North Korea have 
different 
interests of their own. Major domestic businesses that have 
earnestly traded with North Korea have a keen interest in how 
sanctions will be imposed. North Korea team leaders of major 
general trading corporations say that what they want to know 
most are the timetable of the sanctions and details of the 
sanctions for each phase. The Samsung Economic Research 
Institute said that U.S.-led international economic sanctions 
can be imposed in one of three different ways. 
  Experts say that limited sanctions involving the ROK, the 
United States, and Japan may likely be imposed under 
circumstances in which China is opposed to UN-led sanctions. 
They predict that the United States and North Korea may enter 
into negotiations again after economic sanctions, which are of 
strong political and symbolic significance, are imposed. 
  Our government is of the position that if the United States 
decides on its action plan, irrespective of whether it be a 
UN-led sanction or a partial sanction, our government plans to 
map out its own sanction plan depending on the intensity of the 
U.S. sanction plan. A government source said that the 
"possibility is nil at present that we will take the initiative" 
to put an end to indirect North-South trade and ban contacts 
with North Koreans. 
  North-South trade has recently increased, even though 
tensions have continuously intensified on the Korean peninsula 
because of the nuclear issue. The volume of trade between the 
North and South was $187 million (on a customs-clearance basis) 
last year, a 7.6 percent increase over 1992. The ROK is North 
Korea's fourth largest trading partner, after China, Japan, and 
Russia. ROK businesses are North Korea's "extremely good" 
trading partners. Based on their strategic policy of 
maintaining a "channel of dialogue" with North Korea, big 
business groups involved in trade with North Korea have given 
the best terms to North Korea even if they lose money. They 
have bought North Korean goods with cash advances and sold goods 
on credit. 
  A Singaporean trading agent says: "North Korea has many 
unpaid bills in trade with ROK businesses. If sanctions are 
imposed, ROK businesses will not be able to receive the money." 
However, big business groups say that "we did not begin trade 
with North Korea to make profit in the first place." ROK 
businesses bought goods worth $178 million from North Korea last 
year. The investments for processing on commission, the trade 
of goods sold in third countries, and unreported deals were not 
unaccounted for in the National Unification Board statistics. 
The volume of North-South trade is much greater than what the 
government's official statistics show, even though the 
government has painstakingly turned a blind eye to this status. 
A man involved in trade with North Korea says: "It is no 
exaggeration to say that North Korea has bought oil and food 
from China with the foreign exchange which ROK business has 
`given' it." He also says that the "blow which an end to 
North-South trade will deal to North Korea will be enormous."

  [Text] North Korea appears set to test-fire a ballistic 
missile to rattle states seeking to punish it for defying U.N. 
nuclear inspectors, a leading expert said Thursday, citing U.S. 
intelligence sources. 
  Joseph Bermudez, a consultant to Jane's Intelligence Review 
who is an authority on the North's military and intelligence 
affairs, said the intelligence community expected Pyongyang to 
test-fire a Nodong-1 ballistic missile "any day now." 
  North Korea initially test-fired its Nodong-1 into the East 
Sea (Sea of Japan) in May 1993.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has decided 
to resume accepting Japanese tourists one year after they banned 
entry of foreign sight-seers in June last year, it was learned 
here Tuesday. 
  North Korea stopped issuing visas to Japanese tourists one 
year ago when international tension began building up over its 
nuclear question. 
  An official of Chukai Travel Co., a Japanese travel agent 
specializing in North Korea tours, said Tuesday, "a North Korean 
travel firm informed us in mid-May of a plan to accept Japanese 
tourists." He said his firm has been advertising for North 
Korea visitors. 
  Japanese tourists are expected to enter North Korea by 
chartered plane via Beijing. 
  "North Korea seems to have decided to resume accepting 
foreign tourists as international tension over the nuclear issue 
has begun to ease," a Japanese public security official said.

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul police have 
decided to mobilize 14,000 riot troopers to beef up security in 
and around Yoido Plaza, the Democratic Liberal Party 
headquarters, the American Embassy and other major installations 
in the capital to stave off possible raids by Uruguay Round [UR] 
accord protesters. 
  A large-scale outdoor rally seeking to block ratification of 
the Uruguay Round agreement is slated for Yoido Plaza at 3 P.M. 
Saturday, with some 20,000 people including members of the 
National Alliance for Democracy and Unification, Chongukyonhap, 
and collegians attending. 
  The ralliers are to stage a 5-km street march to the Yonsei 
University campus after the gathering, probably causing serious 
traffic jams in and around Mapo and Shinchon, western Seoul. 
  Prior to the rally, some 7,000 students from seven Seoul 
universities, including Yonsei and Sogang, will march to Yoido 
Plaza in separate groups to demonstrate their determination to 
stop the National Assembly from ratifying the UR accord. 
  Some 1,000 students affiliated with Namchongnyon, the 
Federation of Student Councils in Kwangju and South Cholla 
Province, gathered at Yongdungpo station to prepare for the 
rally.

  [Text] Following the incident in which train operations 
were stopped in Kwangju due to the sit-in demonstration by 
students from the Federation of Students Councils in Kwangju and 
South Cholla Province [Namchongnyon], train operations were 
interrupted again at Yongdungpo Railway Station in Seoul today 
for 40 minutes while the police dispersed violent demonstrations 
of students and farmers. 
  On the other hand, the police decided to arrest some 90 
university students today in addition to some 30 students it had 
already arrested on 18 June. 
  Reporter Kim Song-chin reports: 
  [Begin Kim Song-chin recording] Students and farmers, 
members 
of the General Federation of National Farmers Associations, held 
a rally in Yoido, Seoul this afternoon opposing the National 
Assembly ratification of the Urguay Round accord. After the 
rally, they attempted to march toward the National Assembly 
Hall, but were stopped by riot police. Some 200 demonstrators, 
students and farmers, stormed the Yongdungpo Railway Station 
compound. As a result, train operations stopped there for a 
while. 
  The students and farmers who stormed into the railway 
station 
compound blocked train operations, and some of them occupied the 
tracks. Train operations on the Seoul-Pusan line and the Honam 
line, as well as electric train operations, were interrupted for 
some 40 minutes. The police arrested some 70 students and 
farmers on the spot. 
  On the other hand, 32 students from Namchongnyon were 
arrested for their involvement in the incident in which train 
operations at Songchong Railway Station, near Kwangju, were 
interrupted and policemen were kidnapped. It is likely that 
about 91 students will be arrested for their involvement in 
violent demonstrations. Thus, the total number of arrested for 
the involvement in violent demonstrations will be around 120, 
the largest number since the present civilian-let government 
took office. 
  The students arrested today are those who were involved in 
forcibly stopping train operations near Kwangju, including So 
Il- sok, Choson University student; and those who used iron 
clubs in the violent demonstrations, including Om Su-hwan, a 
Hongik Universtity student. 
  The police said they will take strong countermeasures by 
arresting all the student demonstrations leaders and taking a 
stern judicial action against them. In accordance with this 
step, the police have continued searching activities at 
university campuses and strengthened check-up points at railway 
stations and bus terminals. [end recording] 
  The government held a meeting of ministers concerned with 
public security and labor affairs today and decided to take 
strong countermeasures on the students violent demonstrations 
and possible strikes of the Korean National Railway and subway 
workers. At the same time, it issued a statement expressing 
concerns about the recent developments. Reporter Kim Hui-chong 
reports: 
  [Begin Kim Hui-chong recording] Through a joint press 
statement of four ministers--the home minister, justice 
minister, labor affairs minister, and transportation 
minister--the government expressed deep concern about a possible 
serious economic situation which may be created by the students' 
violent demonstrations and the workers' strike in addition to 
the North Korean nuclear issue. Accordingly, the government 
clarified that it will take stern countermeasures against the 
forces attempting to stage strikes. 
  At today's meeting, the government decided to ferret out 
without fail those students who were involved in stopping the 
train operations in the Kwangju area and in kidnapping policemen 
during their violent demonstrations by mobilizing all available 
police forces and to arrest not only those students who led the 
demonstrations but also those who actively participated in them. 
  The government also decided that it will increase budgetary 
support to reinforce police investigation activities and police 
equipment. The government will strengthen investigation 
activities to ferret out if the pro-North forces within the 
country are closely linked to student activists. [end recording]

Cambodian leaders to the Sixth Development Cabinet ministers and 
other high-ranking Indonesian officials. Shortly after seeing 
the state guests off to the State Guest House, Minister-State 
Secretary Murdiono briefed reporters on the significance of the 
Cambodian guests' visit to Indonesia. 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] Cambodian First Prime Minister 
Prince Ranariddh, who spoke more than the other guests, 
expressed his gratitude for the invitation to visit Indonesia 
and also for Indonesia's role in supporting Cambodia's peace 
process, which led to the establishment of a Cambodia based on 
the new Constitution. Prince Ranariddh also said Indonesia was a 
true friend of the Cambodian people and expressed hope that the 
current visit would further strengthen existing traditional ties 
between the two countries. [end recording] 
  Also present at the ceremony this morning were the vice 
president and Mrs. Sutrisno as well as members of the diplomatic 
corps. The Cambodian state guests are scheduled to lay a wreath 
at Jakarta's Kalibata heroes cemetery this afternoon.

  [Text] A senior official at the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI] revealed on 17 June that Japan and the 
United States have agreed to hold subcabinet-level negotiations 
between Deputy MITI Vice Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu and 
Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten in late June to 
discuss the auto and auto parts issue under the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. A place for the talks has not been 
decided. 
  Based on the results of working-level talks to be held in 
Washington on 23 and 24 June, they will hold final consultations 
in an effort to reach an agreement before the Naples summit 
(meeting of leaders of the seven industrialized nations) 
beginning 8 July. 
  Commenting on negotiations on the government procurement 
sector, for which the deadline for sanctions is set for the end 
of June, the official also disclosed that coordination is now in 
progress on the schedule for talks between Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor following 
the vice-ministerial talks to be held on 22 and 23 June.

  [Text] Of the three priority sectors, Japan and the United 
States are expected to reach an agreement on the government 
procurement sector in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
prior to Japan-U.S. summit to be held during the industrialized 
nations' summit talks (the Naples summit) scheduled for July. 
  During negotiations on the government procurement sector, 
the 
Japanese side has promised that the Japanese Government offices 
will "significantly increase" their purchase of foreign-made 
communications apparatuses and medical equipment, and the United 
States has virtually accepted the promise as "Japan's future 
commitment." The United States is likely to definitely promise 
Japan that the it will not impose any sanctions against Japan on 
the grounds that Japan has failed to live up to its future 
commitment. The two countries will work out an agreement 
document after vice ministerial negotiations, which are 
scheduled for Tokyo beginning 22 June, discuss the details of 
the words "significant increase." 
  Both Japan and the United States are in a hurry to 
coordinate 
their views on the insurance sector, one of the three priority 
sectors, in an effort to find areas of agreement prior to the 
Naples summit. The two countries, however, have still failed to 
bridge their wide differences on the automobile and auto parts 
sector, and it would be difficult for the two countries to reach 
an agreement on the sector prior to the Naples summit. The two 
countries are expected to put off settling negotiations on the 
automobile and auto parts sector until later by compiling an 
"interim report" assessing progress in the negotiations. As a 
result, the two countries will have to seek a phased-settlement 
for the three priority sectors in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. 
  In the negotiations on the government procurement sector, 
both Japan and the United States are expected to concede to each 
other on the question of how to handle an "objective criteria" 
aimed at measuring the openness of the Japanese market. During 
the negotiations on government procurement, the Japan has given 
the United States it's commitment to a "significant increase" 
while rejecting any "numerical targets" which commit it to 
specific market shares for American corporations in the 
government procurement sector. The idea is surfacing of making 
the phrase "Japan's maintenance of the past growth trend in the 
medium and long term" Japan's commitment, and the vice 
ministerial negotiations will discuss details of Japan's 
commitment. The purchase of foreign-made telecommunications 
apparatuses and medical equipment by government offices in 1992 
amounted to approximately $32 million and $85 million, 
respectively. 
  Japan has so far maintained that the objective criteria 
should be used as a yardstick to measure the actual purchase of 
telecommunications apparatus and medical equipment by government 
offices from the past to the present. The United States, 
however, has argued that the objective criteria should be used 
as some targets for future purchases. Thus, the two countries 
dispute how to apply the objective criteria. The United States 
has asserted that "government procurement is different from the 
private sector's procurement and the government can intervene in 
the its own procurement to some extent." The Japanese Government 
has decided to give the United States it's moderate commitment 
after accepting this assertion. The United States is likely to 
praise highly Japan's policy shift to accept the U.S. demand for 
setting future targets. 
  Japan and the United States are in a hurry to settle the 
negotiations on the government procurement sector, because the 
deadline for deciding whether to slap sanctions against Japan in 
accordance with a provision concerning the government 
procurement in the Omnibus Trade Act falls at the end of June. 
If the two countries fail to reach an agreement on the 
government procurement sector, prompting the U.S. Congress to 
begin debating sanctions against Japan, the yen would further 
appreciate against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets 
and a steep rise in the yen's exchange rate against the dollar 
would have an adverse impact on the economies of the two 
countries. Both countries fear the consequences of this.

  [Text] Chaired by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the 
government held a trade meeting to talk about how Japan, which 
runs a huge trade surplus, should buckle down to the task of 
expanding imports. The meeting was held at the prime minister's 
official residence on the morning of 15 June. 
  Following the cabinet's 29 March approval of an outline 
foreign economic reform plan, Vice Chairman of Caterpillar Inc. 
Wagsland [as published] and other foreign experts gave their 
views on government efforts to ease regulations and improve 
other matters. In response, Prime Minister Hata explained his 
resolve to expand Japan's imports. 
  He said: "It will be painful. But, we will not be able to 
enjoy an affluent life unless we realize these economic reforms, 
including the promotion of deregulation and the improvement of 
market access." 
  At the meeting, Vice Chairman Wagsland gave his assessment 
of 
Japanese efforts in such areas as deregulation and improved 
market access. 
  He said: "Some people in the American financial world are 
skeptical about the seriousness of efforts by Japanese society 
as a whole." 
  Chairman of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
Kramp 
[as published) criticized Japan's bureaucratic system. 
  He said: "Although there are no clear import barriers, 
practical regulations such as administrative guidance still 
exist." 
  Chairman of the Thai Trade Council Wanli [as published] 
called for Japanese contributions to economic development in 
Asia. 
  He said: "We hope Japan will hand over to us industrial 
sectors which have lost their competitive power."

  [Text] Officials of the Department of Trade and Industry 
[DTI] pointed out that the new accord forged during the final 
negotiation of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade does not exempt the United States from 
tariffication of its sugar imports. 
  The DTI's Bureau of International Trade Relations [BITR] 
clarified that the decision of the United States to maintain its 
present level of sugar importation, including the substantial 
amount exported by the Philippines, is based precisely on the 
conversion of its quantitative restrictions on the import of 
that product to tariff equivalents. This, in effect, is what 
the principle of tariffication is all about. BITR Director 
Antonio Buencamino pointed out that conversion of import 
ceilings to tariff increases to effect the same degree of 
protection for country's competitive industries. 
  The clarification is made in the wake of assertion of Sugar 
Regulatory Administration head Rodolfo Gamboa that the U.S. 
quota system, which presently employs tariffs, received an 
exemption from the GATT agreement under the Uruguay Round.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Cambodia' -- The Unending Problem"] </F>
  [Text] The Cambodian problem remains unsolved as the 
negotiations between the Cambodian Government and the Khmer 
Rouge, which continues to cling to its long-held territory, have 
become an exercise in bargaining for power. The negotiations in 
Pyongyang and Phnom Penh have failed, and therefore, national 
reconciliation have not materialized. Both sides will continue 
to wage a war. The government side will try to suppress and 
seize the Khmer Rouge-held territory, while the Khmer Rouge will 
try to keep what it has. 
  The situation after the latest round of negotiation appears 
to be increasingly tense, as the Cambodian Government ordered 
the closure of the Khmer Rouge liaison office in Phnom Penh and 
eviction of the office personnel. The government said the 
safety of the personnel is at risk from possible attacks by 
indignant Cambodians. The Khmer Rouge's Khieu Samphan was once 
physically attacked by an angry mob in Phnom Penh. 
  The fact is that a majority of the Cambodian people despise 
the Khmer Rouge for the murders it committed and troubles it 
caused them during its 1975-1979 rule. The Khmer Rouge and its 
foreign allies must accept this fact and understand the feelings 
of the Cambodian people. It is not unusual that a majority of 
the international community have determinedly refused to accept 
the Khmer Rouge apology. 
  Moreover, the U.S. support is a factor that contributes to 
the Cambodian Government's increasingly aggressive position 
toward the Khmer Rouge. The United States has sent military 
advisers to train Cambodian Government soldiers. Certainly, 
military hardware is also given to the Phnom Penh government. 
The U.S. assistance has strengthened the Phnom Penh 
government's military position. In the meantime, the Khmer 
Rouge's military position is likely to weaken as time passes due 
to the absence of support of the majority of the population. 
  In such a situation, the tendency is that there will be 
intense fighting as the Phnom Penh government steps up its 
drastic suppression of the Khmer Rouge to seize its territory 
with the aid of the United States and its Western allies. For 
Thailand, there will be repercussions from the war in the forms 
of stray shells and influx of fleeing Cambodians. The Thai 
Government will have to formulate measures to prevent suspicion 
of the international community about its support of the Khmer 
Rouge. There are people who continue to refuse to understand 
Thailand, as evidenced by the imagination of the former U.S. 
ambassador to Thailand regarding Thai support of the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Representatives of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) visited Burmese refugee camps 
in Tak yesterday as part of a plan to repatriate 60,000 Burmese 
nationals from 13 refugee camps. 
  The vice chairman of the Karen Refugee Committee guided 
UNHCR's Ruprecht Arnim and three other representatives on a tour 
of two refugee camps at Ban Huai Kralok in Mae Sot and Maokoe in 
Ban Phopphra. 
  At the Huai Kralok camp, Mr Arnim told the refugees the 
UNHCR 
was considering a repatriation programme for the 60,000 Burmese 
nationals living in Thailand. 
  He said his visit was to study the living conditions of the 
refugees, conditions he described as abnormal. 
  "The UNHCR is trying to work out a coordinated plan with 
Thai 
and Burmese officials to facilitate this `homecoming' and in 
seeking a permanent solution to the refugees' problems," he said. 
  Mr Arnim also said a central committee to supervise the 
repatriation would have to be created to guarantee the returning 
Burmese would not be harmed or come under undue pressure from 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). 
  This group of UNHCR representatives has been in Thailand on 
a 
National Security Command-approved mission since June 12. They 
are to visit refugees camps in Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son and Tak. 
  The group will meet with Third Army officials in Phitsanulok 
today. 
  The Third Army Task Force 34 Coordinator in Mae Sot, Col 
Phongsak Suksawat, said both Thailand and Burma had already 
started repatriation talks at the Thai-Burmese Border Committee 
level last month. The talks were headed by First Army commander 
Lt-Gen Chettha Thanacharo and Burmese South Eastern Force 
commander Maj-Gen Khet Sein. 
  Col Phongsak said the committee assigned local Thai and 
Burmese officials to consider the repatriation of the 60,000 
Burmese refugees from the 13 camps along the border. 
  The majority of the refugees are Karen who escaped Burma 
from 
the area under Karen National Union [KNU] control during the May 
16 SLORC drive against the KNU. 
  The Task Force coordinator said there was no longer fighting 
along the Tak border. 
  "SLORC and the KNU have agreed to formal peace talks," he 
said. 
  He also said 3,000 Karens had been repatriated safely and 
had 
been living without disturbance from SLORC for over a month.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan is considering 
holding ministerial-level trade talks with the United States in 
Washington around July 5, a senior official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said Tuesday. 
  The talks are aimed at striking an accord on the three 
priority areas for the "framework" negotiations before the July 
8-10 Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) key industrial 
countries, the official said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata will likely visit the U.S. before 
flying to Italy for the annual summit, said the official who 
declined to be named. 
  The three framework trade priority sectors are insurance, 
government procurement, and trade in autos and auto parts. 
  The official said the two countries will hold 
subcabinet-level talks on auto and auto parts trade in 
Washington in the first half of next week, aiming to reach 
consensus on "objective criteria" as a yardstick to assess the 
openness of the Japanese auto market. 
  The official said he is not certain about whether Tokyo and 
Washington will reach a complete agreement on auto trade before 
the Naples summit. 
  Japan will decide whether or not to postpone final 
settlements on auto trade beyond the summit at the end of next 
week by evaluating results of discussions at the planned 
subcabinet-level talks, the official said. 
  He said subcabinet-level talks will also be held in 
Washington next week on government procurement and insurance.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Tuesday he plans to visit the United States this 
weekend for bilateral trade "framework" talks with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. 
  Kakizawa said he revealed his plan for the U.S. visit to 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in a meeting after the regular 
cabinet session and Hata approved it. 
  But his U.S. visit depends on what happens in the Diet, 
Kakizawa told reporters. 
  Japan and U.S. officials have said they hope to reach an 
agreement in the talks on setting up a new bilateral trade 
framework before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrialized nations in July. 
  Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to meet 
in 
Naples. 
  Kakizawa is tentatively scheduled to leave for the U.S. on 
Friday [24 June] evening and return to Tokyo on Monday. 
  The two sides are considering a West Coast city such as Los 
Angeles or San Francisco as the venue of the Kakizawa-Kantor 
meeting, government sources said. 
  Kantor has strongly requested a meeting with Kakizawa, the 
sources said. 
  Japan and the U.S. have also considered a meeting between 
Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, but 
gave up on that as it was too difficult to arrange, they said.

  [Text] The government, which is pushing for a North-South 
summit at an early date, had a cool reaction to the remarks of 
Mrs. Mutsuko Miki, wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Miki, 
on North Korean President Kim Il-song expressing the hope for a 
North-South summit on 15 August. This is because President Kim 
Il-song's remarks conveyed by Mrs. Miki are not an official 
response to our side's proposal made on 20 June, even if his 
remarks are true, and because 15 August is not an early date, as 
President Kim conveyed to Carter. 
  This being the case, the government, paying no attention to 
this for the moment, has begun to work out concrete plans for 
realizing a North-South summit at an early date. 
  Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of 
unification, met this morning with Chong Chong-uk, senior 
presidential secretary for security and diplomatic affairs, and 
shared the view that the government should strive to realize a 
North-South summit by mid-July. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku then discussed measures for 
the convocation of the summit with Song Yong-tae, vice 
unification minister; and Chong Si-song, director of the 
secretariat for North-South talks. They came to a conclusion 
that the North Korean attitude of continuing to slander the 
South without responding to our side's proposal makes us doubt 
its true intention. However, our side should not necessarily 
regard this as a pessimistic signal. 
  A relevant government official pointed out that considering 
past practice, it is very likely that North Korea will make a 
counterproposal and suggest a later date than the one we 
proposed. This notwithstanding, if North Korea does not attempt 
to drag on the issue of agenda items during a preliminary 
contact, the convocation of talks before mid-July would not be 
difficult. 
  This official also noted that either Seoul or Pyongyang 
could 
possibly be the venue for the talks rather than Panmunjom or a 
third country. However, even if the North Korean side wants to 
designate a third place within the Korean peninsula, this will 
not work as a factor that would drag on time.

<F P=106> [By Salmy Hashim] </F>
  [Text] Washington, June 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
appreciates U.S. concerns over the formation of the East Asia 
Economic Caucus (EAEC), but assures the United States that the 
proposed forum would not weaken or undermine APEC [Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation]. 
  Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Abdul Razak said here 
Wednesday it was rather disheartening to learn that the United 
States has formally informed Japan that it is opposed to the 
ASEAN proposal of EAEC. 
  I found it rather surprising since the concept ideally 
promotes market-driven open regionalism and supports regional 
economic cooperation, he said when opening the two-day fifth 
U.S.-Malaysia colloquium jointly organised by ISIS [Institute of 
Strategic and International Studies] (Malaysia) and the Asia 
Foundation. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs 
Winston Lord, who was present at the gathering and stopped by 
journalists upon leaving, said that the U.S. had given its 
initial response on the EAEC proposal to its ASEAN friends as 
well as Japan. 
  While neither confirming nor denying U.S. opposition to the 
proposal, Lord indicated that the proposal, presented to the 
U.S. by ASEAN at the recent U.S.-ASEAN dialogue here, was more 
elaborate than we expected... But I'd rather not talk about it 
in this forum ... We just have to wait and see where we go from 
here. 
  Asked about U.S. concerns about the proposal, Lord said, we 
have stated our concerns many times... that we want to 
participate in the Asia-Pacific area in all aspects. 
  Najib, in his opening remarks, said that he was aware of the 
domestic public opinion in the U.S. and even Congressional 
opposition to such an initiative especially when it does not 
include the U.S. 
  I can also understand the concern of the U.S. about a 
one-voice East Asia, a united East Asia (being led by Japan), he 
said, but emphasised that the EAEC was not a unity concept but 
merely a loose consultative forum without a formal secretariat 
to discuss economic issues of mutual concern. 
  It is my personal hope that despite the apparent objection 
by 
the U.S. on this concept, they should not put up barriers by 
exerting pressure on others not to support it, said Najib, who 
is here on a nine-day visit covering Washington D.C., New York, 
Philadelphia, and St. Louis.

  [Text] Washington, June 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia has 
called on the United States to engage in a paradigm shift -- 
moving away from physical presence and concentrating on the role 
of provider -- when playing its security role in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  Defence Minister Mohamed Najib Abdul Razak said that as a 
provider, the U.S. could offer countries like Malaysia 
technology transfer, information, and access to state-of-the-art 
training to assist in Malaysia's effort to modernise its defence 
capabilities. 
  I hope our modernisation process will continue because a 
stronger Malaysia, in military terms, makes for a stronger ASEAN 
... I see it as a deterrent value, he told members of the 
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace at a luncheon address 
on Malaysia's concept of strategic security: Towards a Stable 
and Peaceful Environment Wednesday. 
  Najib, who is in the U.S. for a nine-day visit, quashes the 
idea of an arms race in the region, emphasising that Malaysia's 
modernisation programme was not to keep up with the neighbouring 
countries, but merely to replace its antiquated asset, some 
purchased when my father was defence minister, he told an amused 
audience. 
  There is no immediate threat, but if things do go wrong (I'm 
not saying things will go wrong) we will be more prepared ... 
ASEAN will be more prepared. Who knows what will happen in the 
21st century, he said. 
  On why Malaysia recently purchased only eight F-18 from the 
U.S. but 18 MiG-29 from the Russians, he explained that the 
costs of the two packages were equivalent. 
  He added that although the Russian MiGs were older, they 
were 
equipped with new engines and air frames that met Malaysia's 
specifications and current needs. 
  As for the eight F-18s, he quipped, there's scope for more 
... We only have half a squadron ... No pilot likes to fly with 
half a squadron. 
  Najib later told journalists that Malaysia had no immediate 
plans to purchase additional F-18s and that his visit to the 
McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis, Missouri next week was to 
identify areas of cooperation and technology transfer.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs. -- British Trade Minister 
Richard Needham has clarified that his statement that pressure 
would grow on his government to retaliate if Malaysia continued 
with its policy of not awarding new government contracts to 
British firms, had been taken out of context. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Dr. Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan 
said today Wisma Putra [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] received a 
letter from Needham last week. 
  Dr. Abdullah said the letter was discussed at yesterday's 
cabinet meeting and Needham's reasons were noted. 
  "It was decided that no further action is necessary on the 
matter as the reasons given were deemed sufficient," he added. 
  Dr. Abdullah said Needham had made it clear that his 
statement to REUTER News Agency was not meant as a threat to 
Malaysia. 
  Asked if Needham had explained in what context he gave the 
statement, Abdullah said he did not elaborate this in his letter. 
  "The reasons given are sufficient... there is no possibility 
of retaliation (by Britain) and we will accept that (the 
reasons)," he told reporters after receiving a RM [Malaysian 
ringgit] 10,000 cheque for the Barisan Bertindak Bosnia [Bosnian 
Action Front] Fund from Rotary Club District 330 at his ministry. 
  Asked if Wisma Putra had sought the clarification from 
Needham, Dr. Abdullah said no. He said Needham sent the letter 
on his own accord after reading in the newspapers about 
Malaysia's dissatisfaction over his statement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia, 
one of the emerging and fast growing economies in Southeast 
Asia, can serve as a gateway for Mexican investors for the rest 
of the region, Energy, Telecommunications, and Posts Minister S. 
Samy Vellu said. 
  Malaysia's favourable investment incentives and its 
off-shore 
finanial centre would facilitate the flow of capital to the 
region, he added. 
  The prospect of trade between both countries is bright and 
tremendous as both governments have liberalised and privatised 
state-run companies, including various utilities, he said. 
  He was speaking at the signing of a memorandum of 
understanding [MOU] on communications between Mexico and 
Malaysia in Mexico City Tuesday. The text of his speech was 
released by his ministry here wednesday. 
  Minister of Communications and Transport Emilio Gamboa 
Tatron 
signed for the Mexican Government. 
  Under the MOU, both sides would explore the possibility of 
using their satellite systems to handle communications traffic 
between Latin America and the Asian region. 
  The Malaysian East Asia Satellite (Measat) is due for launch 
next year, while Mexico already has its Solidaridad satellite. 
  The MOU would also explore the technical and economic 
feasabilities of using both satellites to handle communications 
traffic between both countries.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed Tuesday witnessed the signing of a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between a Malaysian and an 
American consortium to undertake a housing and infrastructure 
project in South Africa. 
  The Malaysian companies led by Taliworks (Oversea) Sdn Bhd 
[private limited] will participate in the construction of low- 
to medium-cost houses, complete with infrastructural facilities. 
  It will also help create new townships, apart from expanding 
existing ones. 
  The American consortium, headed by Black &amp; Veatch 
International company, will be responsible for the drawing up of 
a masterplan of the township and housing development besides 
providing financial backing and participating in power 
generation projects. 
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the prime minister 
said he was very happy that American and Malaysian companies had 
come together to work in South Africa. 
  We have always stressed that in our relationship with South 
Africa, we would contribute to solving some of their social, 
economic and even political problems, he said. 
  He said the situation in South Africa was not unlike that in 
Malaysia and there was a need to restructure society and to 
bring in everybody so that each one would have a share in the 
wealth of the country. 
  I think this is an area that Malaysians are conversant with, 
he said adding that Malaysia could help to resolve problems on 
inequitable racial development in South Africa. 
  Dr Mahathir said he was quite sure the Malaysian and the 
American companies involved in the project were aware of the 
problems and would implement their projects with due regard to 
the situation in South Africa. 
  On the opening of a mission in South Africa, he said Wisma 
Putra (Foreign Ministry) had sent a representative there. 
  The MOU was signed by Taliworks Chairman Mohamed Hussaini 
Abdul Jamil and Black &amp; Veatch Asia Pacific Managing Director 
and Regional Executive Howard A. Russel. 
  Works Minister Datuk Leo Moggie, who was present, said 
Taliworks had some experience in civil and construction works, 
particularly in water development. 
  However, their involvement in the MOU now is only at the 
conceptual stage and it is intended that a consortium of various 
Malaysian companies will participate when the whole project 
becomes more concrete later on. 
  The idea now is to have a framework that can work together 
with a group of American companies so that we can work out the 
details and the involvement of other potential companies will be 
determined at a later date, he said.

  [Excerpt] Petaling Jaya, Fri. -- The second batch of 35 
police officers left early yesterday by a Malaysia Airlines 
flight from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Subang to 
serve as peacekeepers with the United Nations Operations in 
Mozambique (Unomoz). 
  Led by Superintendent Shamsuri Abdul Rahim, 45, the officers 
left at 1am [1700 GMT] to Johannesburg, South Africa enroute to 
Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. They will be in transit in 
Johannesburg for eight hours before catching a local flight to 
Maputo. 
  Shamsuri is the head of the administration unit of the 
Disciplinary Branch with the Federal police headquarters in 
Bukit Aman. 
  He said his team would spend about a year with Unomoz and 
gradually replace the first batch of 35 officers who began their 
duty on November 16 last year. 
  "We will be stationed in groups throughout the 11 provinces 
in Mozambique as observers for the October 30 general elections 
there," he told newsmen at the airport. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Sat. -- The increasing support for the 
MCA [Malaysian Chinese Association] shows that the party is now 
more acceptable to the Chinese community and this augurs well 
for the Barisan Nasional [BN], Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed said today. 
  He said a strong MCA meant that BN would become even 
stronger. 
  In congratulating the party leaders and members for their 
hard work in making MCA a strong and respected party, he said 
the community should continue to support the party as it was the 
only one which could safeguard the interests of the Chinese in 
the context of a multi-racial society. 
  "The MCA is also acceptable to UMNO [United Malays National 
Organization] and other component parties as it is not extreme 
or racist. 
  "It can also resolve problems in a rational way, quiet but 
effective," he said at the opening of the 41st MCA annual 
general meeting at Wisma MCA [MCA Building], here. 
  Dr. Mahathir also said that it was important that the people 
support the Barisan Nasional government for the country's 
continued stability, development and prosperity. 
  The government was a "tested" one and had proven its ability 
to fulfil the needs and aspirations of all races, he said, 
adding the BN government was fair to all races and gave priority 
to their interests and those of the country. 
  "As a result, the country enjoys peace and prosperity and is 
free from any racial strife." 
  Dr. Mahathir drew applause from the delegates when he said 
that the country's successes in various fields had drawn 
worldwide attention and many countries had even indicated their 
intention to learn from Malaysia. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the moderate BN government also strongly 
opposed any form of extremism. 
  "Extremism, racial or religious, in a multi-racial and 
multi-religious country like Malaysia will only bring about 
instability and riots," he added. 
  Dr. Mahathir, who is also the BN chairman, said that despite 
the country's successes, there were certain quarters who were 
unhappy and had criticised and alleged that the country was 
undemocractic, unfair and had no respect for human rights. 
  "What is more disappointing is that there are opposition 
politicians who are influenced by this or have joined in such 
efforts to smear the country's image. They (opposition 
politicians) even supply false information to these people," he 
added. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the government was aware of individuals 
and 
opposition politicians who alleged, among other things, that 
there was no freedom of speech through their interviews with the 
foreign media. 
  "The fact that they can express their opinions and provide 
incorrect information only shows that they are lying," he said, 
adding that the government was disappointed with the actions of 
these opposition politicians which he described as "betraying 
the country". 
  "The difference between BN members and the opposition 
parties 
is that BN members are responsible for maintaining the country's 
image, to develop the nation and preserving harmony and peace. 
  "On the other hand, the opposition parties do not have any 
programmes for the good of the country. 
  "Besides, these opposition parties only know how to reject 
facts and criticise the country's success, knowing that such 
actions would be detrimental to the country and the people." 
  Dr. Mahathir also spoke of some opposition parties which had 
even belittled the country in the international arena. 
  "They even accuse Malaysia of aiding the Bosnians through 
its 
participation in the United Nations peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina ... when they have done nothing for the 
Bosnian victims." 
  He reiterated that it was Malaysia's sovereign right as an 
independent nation to voice opinions and views on issues that 
involved the country and other developing nations. 
  On talk about an early general election, Dr. Mahathir said 
the "election fever" had already started and attributed this to 
the opposition parties. 
  "It is believed that the opposition started this and fearing 
that this will only affect their own members, they have also 
decided to spread the fever to the Barisan Nasional members," he 
said, drawing laughter from the delegates. 
  He reminded the delegates that the BN had the mandate to 
rule 
the country until October next year and said: "We have yet to 
decide on the date." 
  However, all BN component parties must be ready to face the 
general election any time. 
  He said the opposition parties were worried due to lack of 
issues. 
  He said there was a party which was so desperate that it 
abandoned its so called liberal policy. 
  It tried to get Malay support by changing its name and 
claiming to be a Malay party for the Malays. 
  However, when they were confronted by non-Malays, they 
claimed to be championing the cause of non-Malays, he said. 
  He said it was the same with a party which claimed to be 
championing the cause of the Chinese but when challenged to do 
something for the Chinese, they denied championing the cause of 
the Chinese.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea, on 21 June; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] I. At 1830 on 17 June, the Democratic Kampuchea 
[DK] office received a letter from the Interior Ministry of the 
two-headed government signed by Sar Kheng and Yu Hokkri. It 
ordered the Democratic Kampuchea representative and his entire 
staff to withdraw from the DK office before 19 June 1994. 
  II. According to reliable reports, Interior Minister Sar 
Kheng and Defense Minister Tie Banh -- both communist Vietnamese 
puppets -- met on the orders of their communist Vietnamese 
masters to adopt this measure on 14 June; that is, before the 
roundtable commission meeting on 15 and 16 June. 
  III. According to these reliable documents, the Assembly did 
not meet to decide on this matter and the king did not know 
about it in advance. Therefore, the move to close the DK office 
in Phnom Penh was a dictatorial and fascist measure by the 
police and troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets. They are 
no different than Hitler's fascist Gestapo. This was a decision 
made by communist Vietnam and its puppets, who oppose national 
reconciliation and peace and who continue to fuel the communist 
Vietnamese war and annex Cambodia at will. 
  IV. As for the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], it does 
feel the need to leave its office in Phnom Penh for the 
following reasons: 
  1. The PDK is not afraid of the puppets' fascist police and 
troops -- the lackeys of communist Vietnam. The DK has fought 
more than 250,000 communist Vietnamese aggressor troops since 
1979. It dealt them repeated serious blows until forcing them 
to sign the October 1991 Paris agreement. The DK is not afraid 
to make sacrifices. It has done so repeatedly and has left 
everything behind to defend the nation, race, and land. The DK 
has no goal other than this -- it does not seek profit or power. 
  2. The DK set up this office following the Paris agreement 
at the request of the king and of people from various circles in 
Phnom Penh as well as people nationwide. It did so at the 
request of the overwhelming majority of peace and justice-loving 
countries around the world who want the various Cambodian sides 
to have contact and talk with one another to achieve national 
reconciliation and peace so that Cambodia can enjoy peace and 
Southeast Asia and the Asia- Pacific region can enjoy stability 
and security. 
  After learning of this fascist measure, the king asked the 
PDK to leave to prevent the two-headed government from making 
trouble. At the same time, the king also told the two-headed 
government not to do anything affecting the DK representative. 
If the representative were molested, there would be great 
trouble. In view of this situation, the PDK decided to pull out 
of Phnom Penh. 
  V. The problem is this: What was the goal behind the 
communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets closing the DK 
office in Phnom Penh? Our nation, people in every circle, and 
peace and justice-loving countries around the world have seen 
their goal and clearly realize the following: 
  1. The goal of the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their 
puppets and lackeys is to continue fueling the war to kill the 
Cambodian nation, people, and the DK. This is why, on the one 
hand, they have dispatched men to seek aid -- particularly 
weapons -- from foreign countries, while on the other hand they 
destroyed the roundtable meeting by refusing to discuss national 
reconciliation. Our entire nation and people can clearly see 
this with their own eyes. Increasing numbers of foreign 
observers have also realized that the State of Cambodia has 
become a two-headed government since the UNTAC [UN Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia] election. This is just on the outside, 
however. In essence, the two-headed government remains the 
state authority of the communist Vietnamese puppets -- 90 
percent in Phnom Penh and 100 percent in the provinces. 
  2. In fueling their war of aggression in Cambodia -- using 
Cambodian traitors to kill nationalist Cambodians -- the 
communist Vietnamese have no hope of destroying the DK 
militarily. They have had bitter personal experiences, both in 
the full-scale war of aggression using their own army from 1979 
to 1991, and thereafter. Despite this, the communist Vietnamese 
continue to fuel their war of aggression through their puppets 
in the two-headed government so they can continue to bring in 
Vietnamese nationals to annex Cambodia in a demographic war. 
  The strategy of the communist Vietnamese aggressors poses a 
great danger to the survival of the nation and people. Faced 
with this immense and immediate danger, the PDK -- like other 
nationalist Cambodians -- has a high sense of responsibility and 
duty regarding the survival of the Cambodian nation and race. 
It cannot avoid this responsibility. Now, as in the future and 
in the past, the DK absolutely remains with the nation and 
people, sharing weal and woe. 
  3. Apart form the goal of killing the nation, the people, 
and the DK, do the communist Vietnamese have any other goals in 
ordering their puppet and lackey troops and police to enact this 
fascist measure to close the DK office in Phnom Penh? 
  The answer to this question is very clear; there is no 
doubt about it. The goal of the communist Vietnamese is to cut 
off contact between the DK and the other Cambodian sides 
completely. Once they have done this, the communist Vietnamese 
and their puppets can do whatever they want with those who are 
already in their cage. This is the dark goal of the communist 
Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys in adopting the fascist 
measure to close the DK office in Phnom Penh. 
  VI. Another question that arises is this: Can the communist 
Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys do anything they want 
at will? The answer to this question is also clear; there is no 
doubt about it. The communist Vietnamese and their puppets and 
lackeys cannot do anything at will. The national conflict 
caused by the communist Vietnamese aggressors through the 
Communist Party of Vietnam -- which also controls the so-called 
Cambodian People's Party, the state authority, and over 4 
million Vietnamese -- is already very acute. There is also the 
social conflict resulting from the communist Vietnamese 
aggressors' controlling and plundering the economy of the 
two-headed government -- from paddy, rice, corn, beans, rubber, 
fish, timber, and so on, to other resources. On top of this, 
the Vietnamese nationals who have been flowing into Cambodia -- 
there are more than 4 millions of them now -- have also been 
robbing the country. The ringleaders of the communist 
Vietnamese puppets are also robbing the country. The two-headed 
government is doing the same thing. This has deprived people in 
the rural areas of their farm land and workers and students in 
the cities of jobs. Officials, teachers, and even soldiers are 
being deprived of their salaries. 
  The 15-year communist Vietnamese war of aggression continues 
to rage and destroy the country. Theft and robbery, insecurity, 
prostitution, AIDS, and all kinds of social ills are spreading. 
All of these conflicts are piling onto other conflicts and are 
near the explosion point. The communist Vietnamese and their 
puppets and lackeys are solving this complex situation by 
fueling the war with one hand in an attempt to destroy the DK, 
which is the backbone of the resistance of the entire Cambodian 
nation and people in defending the nation. With the other hand, 
they are using fascist measures to arrest and kill the people 
and the masses in Phnom Penh and various provincial towns who 
are unable to take it any longer and have risen to fight back. 
  Can the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and lackeys 
solve this? Certainly not; on the contrary, the more the 
communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government fuel 
the war, the more fascist they become and the more they oppose 
national reconciliation. In turn, the nation and people will 
oppose and denounce them more and more. The forces of national 
reconciliation will arise and become more agitated and active in 
their struggle. 
  VII. On this occasion, the PDK would like to once again 
affirm its stance as follows: 
  1. In a situation where the communist Vietnamese and their 
puppets and lackeys, bad elements in the Western alliance, and 
the two-headed government continue to fuel the war to kill the 
nation, the people, and the DK, the latter has every right to 
join the nation and people to struggle in every form to defend 
themselves. 
  2. The DK, like the entire nation and people, very much 
needs and wants peace and national reconciliation. In the past, 
present, and future, and under all circumstances, the DK will 
continue to stand firm and unshakable on national reconciliation. 
  3. The DK wants continued roundtable talks and discussions 
to search for national reconciliation based on the two items on 
the agenda as already agreed. This is a billion times better 
than fueling the war. 
  Long live the mighty national reconciliation forces! 
  [Dated] Cambodia, 21 June 1994 
  [Signed] PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan

<F P=106> ["Clarification by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea </F>
Delegation Attending the Roundtable Commission Meeting"; dated 
15 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 15 June 1994 
  I. On 27 May 1994 at the roundtable meeting of Cambodian 
leaders in Pyongyang under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty 
King Norodom Sihanouk, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, on 
behalf of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], suggested 
that the meeting discuss and agree upon a minimal policy program 
to be used as a political basis for national reconciliation. 
  In this spirit H.E. Khieu Samphan said in parts seven and 
nine of his address: 
  To achieve genuine national reconciliation and to rally 
national forces in accordance with the will of our nation and 
people, all of us should compromise and make mutual concessions. 
This is the issue to be discussed now and later on. As His 
Majesty the King has repeatedly stated: How should the PDK be 
included into a national government and into a national army, 
which includes all Cambodian sides? Furthermore, in a situation 
in which there is a national government and a national army 
including all Cambodian sides, how should the PDK hand over 
zones under its control to the national government and merge its 
troops with the national army? 
  To solve these problems, we should set up a minimal policy 
program that all of us agree upon in order to establish a 
national government and a national army that includes all sides. 
We should have such a minimal policy program so that all of us 
can stand on a concrete basis of consensus while we are working 
on national reconciliation and also later when the national 
government and the national army start doing their work. 
  II. The PDK holds that there should be a minimal policy 
program agreed upon and set up by all parties to be used as a 
necessary basis on which all national forces can rally and 
cooperate. Without a minimal policy program agreed upon and 
accepted by everyone as a basis for all, all sides will continue 
in their respective political directions, which are different or 
even contradictory. This way, national reconciliation cannot be 
achieved. Experiences from ancient and modern history, at home 
and abroad, have clearly testified to this. Even experiences 
following the September 1993 election are already clear enough. 
  III. It is obvious that this minimal policy program should 
be set up in accordance with the essence and spirit of the joint 
communique of the roundtable meeting in Pyongyang on 28 May 
1994, part two, which says: 
  The roundtable meeting unanimously agreed on its constant 
loyalty to, support and defense of a unified Cambodia without 
partition of territory, without secession, and with its 
territorial integrity, with the land and maritime borders and 
waters that the international community recognized and respected 
between 1963 and 1969, and with respect for Cambodia's ideals of 
peace, solidarity, national union, independence, and progress. 
  The essence of articles 2 and 52 of the Constitution is also 
clear. Article 2 says: 
  The territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia can in 
no way be violated within its borders as set out in 1:100,000 
maps made between 1933 and 1953, and which were internationally 
recognized between 1963 and 1969. 
  Article 52 says: The Royal Government of Cambodia pledges to 
defend the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 
of the Kingdom of Cambodia and to implement a policy of national 
reconciliation to defend national union and preserve the 
nation's good traditions and customs. The Royal Government of 
Cambodia shall defend its legitimacy and ensure public order and 
security. The state gives priority to the living standards and 
well being of its citizens. 
  The essence of the king's address on 31 October 1993 is 
clear. The magic medicine to cure our Cambodia's serious 
sickness is nothing else but national reconciliation, national 
union, an awakening, and the resolution of all nationalists to 
achieve the sacred national union, the way our nation did in the 
Angkor era, and more recently during the royal crusade for 
Cambodia's full independence in 1952-1953. 
  The aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people is 
national reconciliation and peace. This is the political 
essence that should be taken into account in setting up a 
minimal policy program. 
  IV. How the details of the minimal policy program should be 
worked out is up to all sides to discuss. This minimal policy 
program, once agreed upon by everyone, must be strictly observed 
by all Cambodian sides. Foreigners too have to abide by this 
minimal policy program. 
  As H.E. Khieu Samphan has pointed out in his address at the 
27 May 1994 roundtable talks, for decades the succession of 
problems affecting Cambodia were not created by Cambodians. 
These problems were the result of direct foreign interference 
and aggression. People are aware of the disastrous 
consequences. Although these are the roots of the Cambodian 
problem, as long as Cambodians do their best they will be able 
to solve the problem. Such action is a response to the request 
and profound aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and 
people, who want to see unity among all national forces -- 
forces that are genuinely reconciled and united without any 
political discrimination whatsoever. 
  V. The PDK proposal for all Cambodians sides to agree with 
one another on a minimal policy program in line with the above 
spirit reflects the PDK's responsible spirit and its sincere 
desire to achieve genuine and lasting national reconciliation in 
accordance with the profound aspiration of our nation and people 
so that we have peace and live normally and have a chance to 
quickly rebuild Cambodia. 
  The PDK is striving to work to achieve national 
reconciliation so that there are enough national forces working 
together to continue solve the nation's problems, both large and 
small. This is in order for our Cambodia to gradually move 
toward peace, independence, national union, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity. The PDK has no other objectives than 
these.

600 soldiers to occupy Kdak village in Tbeng 2 commune. On 15 
June between 100 and 150 Khmer Rouge troops attacked and 
controlled three villages of the same commune, including Sralai, 
Chamkaong, and Chhuk villages. 
  The same source added that Tbeng 2 commune has been taken 
and 
occupied by the Khmer Rouge. The royal government forces, in 
the form of local police force, have all retreated. Casualties 
and damage to property in the attacks is not known. 
  It should be noted that the Khmer Royal Armed Forces unit 
stationed in this area is Division 19. It is also known that 
the Khmer Rouge troops operating in the area include Division 
612 and 616.

<F P=106> [From the "A Cornor of Society" column: "Being Wavering, </F>
One Cannot Be King!"] 
  [Text] First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen are the 
leaders to whom the people throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia 
have given their unconditional trust in taking care of their 
survival. 
  The people do not want any other people to become prime 
minister or deputy prime minister. Those people will be able to 
do so only after they stage a successful coup. 
  The people are confident that only these two prime ministers 
are able to prevent the return of the genocidal regime because 
they know the true nature of the Khmer Rouge much better than 
the Khmer Rouge themselves. 
  As for His Majesty the King, we would like him to abide by 
the nation's Constitution because deviating from it will only 
bring trouble. The Constitution does not allow Your Majesty to 
hold power. So, please just sit still. As king, you should not 
waver. 
  KAOH SANTEPHEAP is still unconditionally sincere to the King 
and the Royal Government. 
  But please stop negotiating with the Khmer Rouge. They are 
vanishing, are they not?

  [Summary] Nuon Sam-ean, deputy chief of the Bank Control 
Department of the National Bank of Cambodia, says that private 
banks have brought in around $150 million to contribute to 
Cambodia's rehabilitation. However, some banks have not been 
conducting their business according to the rules. They are only 
declaring their investment capital, which remains outside the 
country, and lending customers' savings as loans to get 
interest. This will no longer be allowed as the National Bank 
plans to introduce four measures to strengthen commercial banks' 
legal operations. In early June there are about 30 private 
banks operating in Phnom Penh. 
  The four measures are as follows: 
  1. Private banks are required to deposit 5 percent of their 
investment capital with the National Bank. 
  2. Each commercial bank's expenditure on immovable 
property, such as land for buildings and furniture, should not 
be more than 30 percent of its investment capital. 
  3. Each commercial bank should deposit 5 percent of its 
savings with the National Bank to prevent commercial banks from 
using the excuse of not having money when customers want their 
savings back. 
  4. Loans to individuals or to groups should not exceed 10 
percent of the bank's investment capital and should not exceed 
20 percent of the borrower's assets. 
  A commercial bank that refuses to implement the four 
measures 
will not be closed but will have some of its activities 
curtailed.

  [Summary] An official at the Ministry of Industry, Mines, 
and Energy, has disclosed that by mid-June nearly 10 
garment-producing factories, among those that have submitted 
applications to do business, have started their operations. 
Companies investing in other sectors have not yet begun their 
operations. 
  According to the official, the reason for the garment 
factories' early start in operations is connected to the fact 
the Cambodia has been granted GSP [Generalised System of 
Preferences] and MFN [Most Favored Nation] status by 26 
countries in February and March. The countries most involved in 
this garment manufacturing sector are the PRC, Taiwan, and Hong 
Kong. Some of these countries have already set up factories, 
such as the case of Supreme Garment, June Textiles, Gold 
Kamvimex, and MSV International. The products of these 
factories are for export and include men's and women's clothing, 
sports garments, and winter clothing. Their markets include 
Britain, France, Denmark, Holland, Germany, and Austria. 
  The official also says that once Cambodia has been 
officially 
granted GSP status by the United States, it is expected that 
more companies from Taiwan and Hong Kong will set up garment and 
shoe factories. However, what holds these companies back is the 
fact that two or three years have already passed and Cambodia 
still does not have an investment law.

  [Text] Relations between the Indonesian Defense and 
Security Department and the U.S. Defense Department continue to 
be excellent even though the education and training program for 
Indonesian military officers conducted by the U.S. Defense 
Department has been stopped. Navy Commodore Yuswaji, chief of 
the Defense and Security Department's Public Relations and 
Foreign Relations Bureau, said this to reporters in Jakarta 
yesterday. 
  Yuswaji said in fact only a small number of U.S. Congressmen 
had wanted to stop the training program. He added that it does 
not mean the Defense and Security Department and the Indonesian 
Armed Forces headquarters will automatically send their officers 
to Australia, which has close ties in military training programs 
with Indonesia, though there are several education and training 
academies there.

Java, to visit the Nusantara Aviation Industries and the 
Asia-African Conference museum. The Cambodian visitors, who 
arrived in Indonesia on 20 June, are scheduled to return home 
today. Also present at the farewell ceremony were acting 
Foreign Minister Susilo Sudarman and Minister-State Secretary 
Murdiono.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Research and Technology </F>
Minister Habibie with unidentified correspondents at Jakarta's 
Halim Perdanakusumah Airport on 4 June -- passages within 
slantlines published in boldface] 
  [Text] On the price of the German ships and their 
maintenance cost 
  [Habibie] The 39 ships were originally bought at 25 million 
German marks. At this price, the ships were equipped with 5,000 
tonnes of ammunition (including 1,550 guided missiles) and spare 
parts for five years. The person who held the negotiations with 
German authorities was Feisal Tanjung, chief of ABRI [Indonesian 
Armed Forces] General Staff at that time and who is now ABRI 
commander. After negotiations, the price was reduced to 20 
million German marks or U.S. $12.7 million. 
  The ships had not been used for three years. Just like a car 
which is parked in the garage for a long time, the ships first 
must be serviced before being used. Their seaworthiness must be 
checked for long-distance voyages and this requires 
expenditures. Well, we did not know the exact condition of the 
ships because we had neither seen the ships nor made any payment. 
  We looked at the deal only at the macro level, namely with 
the purchase of the ships; we need more ports. From 
[Indonesia's most western point] Sabang to [Indonesia's most 
eastern point] Merauke, there are 26 ports which the Indonesian 
Navy says need upgrading, but no funds have ever been allocated. 
  Now the minimum amount we need is U.S. $482,355,422 and this 
figure includes 5,000 tonnes of ammunition, 1,550 guided 
missiles, and other ammunition. 
  On the importance of the ships 
  [Habibie] The Indonesian Navy has 82 ships, 42 of which are 
more than 40 years old and ready to be withdrawn from service. 
Therefore, I called on then Finance Minister Sumarlin to 
allocate funds for our navy. Earlier, I thought the ceiling 
for our allocation was U.S. $3.5 million, but we managed to 
raise it to U.S. $12.7 million. We can use the ships for about 
20 years. As we were able to reduce their price, we were 
granted one-third of the allocation ceiling. Now with the 
allocated funds at U.S.$1.1 billion, the amount will also 
include the construction of facilities for the ships. 
  We then visited Germany and tried to adjust our needs to the 
available budget. It turned out we had to reduce our budget. 
Therefore, we decided to pay special attention to the ships and 
construction of ports. However, as the ships were not used for 
some time, they had to be examined first before embarking on the 
long voyage to Indonesia. Navigation equipment using satellite 
technology also had to be installed. As the climate in Germany 
is always cold, the ships do not require air conditioning and 
they instead required heating systems. This is something 
different from our country where air conditioning systems are 
badly needed. 
  Indeed there are many things that need improvement, but as a 
combat unit, the ships have a considerable amount of power 
capable of keeping the old West German Navy at bay. 
  Reasons for not purchasing new ships 
  [Habibie] The price of each new ship may reach U.S. $200 
million and this does not include ammunition. We are not so 
stupid to increase our budget for nothing. It is noteworthy 
that a neighboring country also wants to buy those ships even 
though that country does not need them badly. Besides, if we 
were late in buying them, the Germans might as well sell them to 
us at a higher price. 
  On Habibie's conflict with Finance Minister Mar'ie 
Muhammad 
  [Habibie] We have confirmed the purchase of the ships and I 
dared not make the decision to buy them if there was no approval 
issued by the president, who is the mandate holder of the 
People's Consultative Assembly. Actually, I knew nothing about 
the ships and my duty was to complete the deal. At that time, 
suddenly we had two obstacles, namely we had to obtain approval 
from the UN Security Council and NATO. The idea was that the 
purchase should not lead to regional tension, but I managed to 
convince them that if the ships belong to Indonesia, they will 
instead benefit the region because they will safeguard the 
region's stability and national development. The fact that I 
managed to convince them was unusual because the Dili incident 
had just broken out at that time. 
  On the condition of the 29 ships 
  [Habibie] They are all fine. If you want to test them, you 
can do it by computer. Or if you want to have a simulated 
crash, the cost, of course, will be very high. However, the 
recent accident [in Bay of Biscay] is good proof that the ships' 
design is excellent. If it was poorly designed, it would have 
sunk in less than five minutes. 
  I want to remind you that three LSTs [landing ship tank] 
have 
arrived in Indonesia. One of them also had one of its front 
doors open during bad weather, but it was shut again.

  [Text] Subrata, director general of press development and 
graphics, told newsmen in Jakarta this afternoon that the 
government has decided to withdraw the publication permits of 
two magazines -- TEMPO and EDITOR -- and a tabloid paper, DETIK. 
  He said the government arrived at this decision after 
listening to advice from the Press Council. He also said that 
the publications had been repeatedly reminded about their 
contents, but the government's directives went unheeded. 
  According to Subrata, the publications' operational licenses 
were withdrawn because of two categories of cases -- an 
administrative reason and the content of news reports. EDITOR 
magazine was banned due to an administrative reason under the 
Information Minister's Decision Letter No. 124/1994 and DETIK 
tabloid was banned under the Information Minister's Decision 
Letter No. 125/1994. TEMPO magazine was banned for its news 
reports under Information Minister's Decision Letter No. 
123/1994. 
  The three Minister of Information's Decision letters banning 
the publications are effective as of today, 21 June 1994.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (AFP) -- The Indonesian Government 
on Tuesday banned three weekly publications, including the 
country's biggest-selling magazine, shortly after they had run 
articles sharply critical of a close associate of President 
Suharto. 
  The director-general of the ministry of information, 
Subrata, 
told a press conference that the authorities were withdrawing 
the publishing licences of TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK. 
  Subrata, who is in charge of press and the graphic 
industries, accused them of flouting official "warnings." He 
said there were administrative reasons for barring EDITOR and 
DETIK, while in the case of TEMPO, the licence was withdrawn 
because of editorial content. 
  All three publications had recently published articles 
attacking the research and technology minister, Bacharuddin 
Jusuf Habibie, a close ally of Indonesian President Suharto. 
  The last magazine to be banned was MONITOR in 1990, for 
having published a popularity survey that placed the Prophet 
Muhammad in 11th place, a rank that outraged many Indonesian 
Muslims. 
  TEMPO, the country's largest-circulation magazine, as well 
as 
the newer DETIK, a tabloid newspaper, had recently reported on a 
rift between Habibie on one hand and the armed forces and 
Finance Ministry on the other, over the purchase of 39 former 
East German warships. 
  On June 2, EDITOR had published a front-page piece on plans 
to set up a group establishing former members of the student 
nationalist movement in the 1960s, which would have rivalled 
Habibie's Association of Muslim Intellectuals. 
  It quoted another government member, Siswono Yudohusodo, a 
former student leader who is now minister of transmigration, as 
saying Habibie's group was guilty of "manoevering." The 
minister of transmigration has responsibility for internal 
population movement in Indonesia, from crowded to remote areas. 
  TEMPO, a news magazine launched in the 1970s, has a 
circulation of 180,000, while EDITOR, also a news magazine, 
founded in 1987 has 30,000. DETIK was launched in 1992, using a 
defunct title, and has a sale of 400,000. 
  Subrata said DETIK had diverged from the remit of its 
publishing licence, which restricted it to reporting on crime 
and social stories. Its reporting on political matters amounted 
to a violation of these parameters, he said. 
  A DETIK journalist, reached by telephone, said that this was 
merely a technical pretext to bar the publications. 
  In the case of EDITOR, the publisher did not exercise full 
editorial control over the magazine, which was also an 
administrative violation, he said. 
  In the case of TEMPO, he said, without elaborating, that the 
ban was because of editorial content. 
  President Suharto had already threatened, at a naval review 
on June 9, to take action against newspapers that targeted 
Habibie. 
  He accused the media of having generated "an atmosphere of 
suspicion that harms stability" and declared: "We cannot let 
(the press) carry on like this. If they are deaf to warnings, 
then we will take steps against them." 
  Indonesia's biggest daily seller, KOMPAS, reported on June 
13 
that Information Minister Harmoko -- another close friend of 
Suharto's and president of the official party, Golkar -- had 
drawn up "severe measures" against what was considered to be a 
media campaign against Habibie. 
  The official news agency ANTARA reported Tuesday that 
Harmoko 
complained last week that "several publications ... have been 
failing to uphold journalistic ethics."

  [Text] Jakarta, June 21 (AFP) -- Human rights activists 
Tuesday called on western powers to take action against 
President Suharto's government for banning three publications. 
  The weeklies TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK were banned after 
running articles sharply critical of a close associate of 
Suharto. 
  Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation chairman Adnan Buyung 
Nasution said, "I would say (US) President Bill Clinton should 
say something and drop his plans to come to Indonesia" in 
November for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meet. 
  Saying he was "very angry" and calling the action an "abuse 
of power" he also said Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating 
should call off his visit next week. 
  Keating is due to arrive for the biggest Australian 
promotion 
ever in Jakarta called "Australia Today." 
  "I hope he (Keating) also understands the feelings of the 
people here and announces that he will not come to Indonesia," 
he said. 
  Political Sciences professor Arief Budiman said he hoped 
that 
Indonesia's main creditors would let Jakarta know how they felt. 
  "I hope there will be an intervention from abroad," he told 
AFP. 
  The Consultative Group on Indonesia, chaired by the World 
Bank, is due to hold its annual meeting on financial aid to 
Indonesia July 7-8 in Paris. 
  By far the largest donation comes from Japan, followed by 
France and the United States.

  [Text] JAKARTA, June 22 (AFP) -- Indonesian students and 
journalists demonstrated here Wednesday against the banning of 
three weekly newspapers, while even a military spokesman 
distanced himself from the government move. 
  More than 200 students and journalists staged a noisy 
protest 
in front of the information ministry, saying the government ban 
had "killed" democracy in the country. 
  One march involving around 150 people went to the ministry 
from the offices of the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), a human 
rights group. Scores of others went from the premises of the 
weekly DETIK tabloid, one of the publications banned. 
  Security officials confiscated banners critical of 
Information Minister Harmoko, but took several journalists, 
student and human rights representatives into the ministry. LBH 
chairman Adnan Buying was among them. 
  After failing to meet ministry officials, the demonstrators 
promised to return on Thursday with a bigger rally behind them. 
  The government announced Tuesday that publishing licences 
for 
DETIK, EDITOR and TEMPO, the country's biggest selling 
newspaper, had been withdrawn. The authorities quoted 
administrative reasons for the ban on EDITOR and DETIK. TEMPO 
was banned because of its editorial content, an information 
ministry official said. 
  But all three publications had written articles critical of 
research and technology ministry Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, an 
ally of President Suharto. 
  A military spokesman, meanwhile, said the ban should not 
have 
happened, a press report said. 
  "I am close to the press and of course I do not want this 
situation to occur," the SUARA PEMBARUAN daily quoted military 
spokesman Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid as saying. "I hope the 
press can learn a lesson from it." 
  Syarwan said he was concerned at the ban and added that the 
information ministry should have considered the move carefully 
before acting. 
  He said the government wanted to develop openness, but that 
the press had to use the opportunity positively. 
  "Don't let the openness create a bad situation and tragedy. 
That is not, of course, what we want," he said. 
  Eros Jarot, chief editor of DETIK, and his counterpart from 
Tempo, Gunawan Muhamad, met Wednesday and later appeared among 
the students with calls to remain calm. 
  Jarot said however the country was entering a "clouded" era 
because of the government move. Jarot called on the government 
to make clear the motives behind the ban. 
  Petitions distributed by journalists during the protests 
said 
the ban breached constitutional guarantees of freedom of 
expression. 
  TEMPO and DETIK have recently reported on a rift between 
Habibie and the armed forces and finance ministry over the 
purchase of 39 former East German ships. 
  Editor this month published a cover story on plans to set up 
a nationalist student movement, led by Transmigration Minister 
Siswono Yudohusodo, to rival Habibie's Indonesian Moslems 
Intellectual Association.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial today, PELITA discusses the 
revocation of the publication permits for three weekly 
publications, namely, TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK. The daily says 
our rational thinking can accept the explanation given by 
Subrata, director general of press development and graphics, who 
spoke on behalf of the government yesterday. In this 
connection, PELITA wonders what the Indonesian press should do 
next in the current second long-term development plan. The 
answer is we should take the incident as a lesson as human 
beings who believe in the almighty God. We should increase our 
sense of national responsibility as loyal citizens of this 
republic who respect the laws, Constitution, and democracy based 
on the Pancasila ideology and the 1945 Constituency. In this 
case, the Indonesian press, which has a positive role in 
maximizing and distributing the benefits of development, should 
be able to consolidate national unity and integrity to enhance 
the quality of democracy. 
  REPUBLIKA wonders why the unwanted incident, even as 
Information Minister Harmoko earlier issued several warnings, 
should have inevitably taken place. The Indonesian press is now 
enjoying an atmosphere of openness praised by many people inside 
and outside the country.

  [Text] Jakarta JP -- Minister of Justice Utoyo Usman said 
the government is thinking about loosening screening procedures 
to detect past communist links for those applying for jobs in 
the administration and other strategic positions. 
  Utoyo said the government is currently reviewing the policy, 
but stressed that certain sectors, such as the Armed Forces 
(ABRI), will continue with the procedure. 
  The screening process, which is also used in the civil 
service, has been widely criticized as a human rights violation. 
This is because it virtually closes the doors on people 
applying for administration jobs who were directly or even 
distantly related to members of the now outlawed Indonesian 
Communist Party (PKI). 
  Other professions in which people must be screened include 
journalism and teaching. Candidates for the House of 
Representatives must also undergo the screening. 
  The screening was often stretched to the point that even the 
grand children of a former PKI or a son-in-law are screened out. 
  Two senior legal experts, Justice Bismar Siregar and Muladi, 
again raised the point that the country should do away with the 
screening. They said, in a seminar on Wednesday, that the 
government should pay more attention to the many victims of the 
policy. 
  Chief Justice Purwoto Gandasubrata, however, said that the 
screening process should still be used in the interest of state 
security and public order "so long as it does not violate 
people's basic rights."

  [Text] China has cautioned the Philippines to go slowly on 
its proposal for an arms registry in Southeast Asia because it 
might raise "suspicions" among the countries concerned and 
depict an arms race in the region, Foreign Affairs 
Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said over the weekend. 
  "They (China) said we should not be in a great hurry to push 
for this (arms registry) proposal because ... to push too hard 
might itself raise suspicions," Mr. Severino said after China's 
foreign ministry officials met with their local counterparts for 
the annual Philippines-China bilateral consultations in Manila 
last Thursday. 
  Manila called for the establishment of an arms registry in 
the region during a senior officials meeting among member-states 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok 
recently to ensure transparency of military armaments, 
particularly on imports, exports, enhancement and weapons 
expenditures. 
  Mr. Severino said Beijing has agreed, however, to an ASEAN 
proposal to have Brunei collect various proposals on the 
framework and mechanism of a regional arms registry. 
  "What was agreed upon was to look at several proposals (for 
an arms registry) and then study it even further. But we told 
them (Beijing) we are pushing for more speed and progress on 
this," Mr. Severino said. 
  During the ASEAN senior officials meet, member-states agreed 
to temporarily shelve the Philippine proposal for an arms 
registry. Instead, the officials suggested that the United 
Nations model be studied further since it was only established 
last year. 
  The Philippine proposal goes beyond the scope of the UN 
model 
and includes transparency on the production of indigenous 
military weapons as well as expenditures. 
  Despite having a different perspective on the Philippine 
proposal Beijing has nonetheless supported Manila's call to have 
the arms registry issue tackled during next month's ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok. 
  The ARF will bring together the foreign ministers of the six 
ASEAN countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand) along with its seven dialogue partners 
(Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, New 
Zealand, and the United States) to tackle growing security 
concerns in the Asia Pacific. 
  It will also have China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New 
Guinea in the discussion table.

<F P=106> [By Lynda T. Jumilla] </F>
  [Text] The government and the National Democratic Front 
[NDF] have agreed to form four "working committees" that will 
lay the groundwork for formal peace talks between the two 
parties. Howard Dee, chief government negotiator with the 
communists, yesterday said the committees will cover human 
rights, socio-economic reforms, political and constitutional 
reforms, and cease-fire and disposition of forces. 
  Interviewed in Malacanang [presidential office], Dee said 
the 
creation of the committees was one of the two agreements forged 
between government and NDF representatives during their 10-14 
June meeting in Breukelen, The Netherlands. The other agreement 
was to get the peace process moving, after having been stalled 
for several months. 
  "In our next meeting before the end of the quarter -- we 
have 
not yet decided the exact site (in Belgium, The Netherlands, and 
Luxembourg) and date -- we will proceed to operationalize these 
working committees," Dee said. 
  Both the government and the NDF will designate their 
respective representatives to the committees, who will then meet 
with their counterparts from the other side to discuss the issue 
assigned to them. 
  During the meeting in the Benelux territories, the two sides 
are also expected to set the venue and date for the formal talks. 
  Meanwhile, Dee said the government will keep its options 
open 
in regard to talking peace with breakaway communist factions. 
  This, despite the NDF's warning that the government would be 
violating the joint declaration signed in Hague, The Netherlands 
in September 1992, should it decide to negotiate with other 
groups. 
  "The government position is, it is the government's 
prerogative to address all those who want to have peace with the 
government because the government wants to make peace with 
everyone," Dee said. 
  But he said there was no decision yet to talk with other 
groups as the government has yet to formulate a policy on the 
matter. 
  Dee and acting presidential peace adviser Manuel Yan will 
meet shortly to discuss policy recommendations on holding talks 
with other groups, he said. 
  So far, the only other communist faction that may seek to 
negotiate with the government is the breakaway Manila-Rizal 
Regional Committee [MRRC] headed by Filemon Lagman. The MRRC is 
the mother unit of the urban hit squad Alex Boncayao Brigade. 
Dee explained that the peace panel deals only with 
organizations with armed units, and these exclude mere political 
groupings such as those headed by other breakaway leaders as 
Ricardo Reyes and Romulo Kintanar. 
  "The decision (to open talks with other factions, as in the 
case of Lagman) should be made at a higher level because the 
case of Lagman is complex," he said. 
  In the case of Lagman, Dee added, the government would have 
to find out what group he represents. 
  As this developed, former NDF chief negotiator Satur Ocampo 
said the NDF was likely to insist on holding formal talks abroad 
despite the government's shifting-venue policy. 
  The NDF's position remains that holding the talks outside 
the 
Philippines would minimize the risks of its negotiators and 
staff being put under surveillance or arrest, he said.

  [Text] Speaker Jose De Venecia yesterday expressed 
predicted increased trade between the Philippines and the 
People's Republic of China following an agreement to establish 
consulates in both countries. [sentence as published] 
  The Chinese government agreed to set up a consulate in Cebu 
and for the Philippines to set up its own consulate in Xiamen 
City during a visit to Beijing by Filipino legislators led by De 
Venecia. 
  De Venecia said the Philippines would be the first country 
to 
be allowed to set up a consulate in the southern part of China 
since 14 consulates were closed down in 1949 during the takeover 
of the Communist Party. 
  De Venecia, together with Rep. Antonio Cuenco, Victor Ortega 
and Roque Ablan, held talks with President Jiang Zemin, Speaker 
Qiao Chi and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and 
leaders from the Inner Mongolia, Shanghai and Xiamen. 
  "We expect tens of thousands of mainland Chinese tourist to 
come to the Philippines because of the improving standard of 
living in southern China resulting from the area's annual growth 
of 20 to 30 percent -- which is the highest in the world," de 
Venecia said.

  [Text] In yet another confidence-building pitch for 
foreign investments, the Monetary Board (MB) last Friday 
approved the complete lifting of existing restrictions on 
repayment and repatriation of foreign investments financed by 
transactions using the debt-to-equity scheme. 
  In a press statement, Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] Governor 
Gabriel C. Singson said the move "marks another important step 
in foreign exchange liberalization." 
  Considered the most successful mode of easing the country's 
debt burden, the debt-to-equity program has historically 
accounted for about 30 percent of the total external debt which 
has undergone restructuring. Debt converted under the program 
reached $1.87 billion out of the total $6.382 billion recorded 
from 1986 to 1993, the Bangko Sentral's 1993 annual report shows. 
  The debt-to-equity program was launched in 1985 as a 
mechanism to reduce the country's external debt and to encourage 
the entry of the then elusive foreign investments. Under the 
program, investors are allowed to buy Philippine debt papers, 
redeem these at a higher price and invest the proceeds in 
eligible projects. 
  The investor gains from the spread between the redemption 
price at which he sells the paper to the Bangko Sentral and the 
price at which he buys it from the secondary market. 
  The program also augurs well for the Bangko Sentral as it is 
able to retire its debt at deep discounts. The mechanism was 
revised in 1990 particularly to retire the then Central Bank's 
$900-million outstanding obligations to foreign banks over a 
three-year period which ended last year. 
  The MB decided to defer the program in September 1993 due to 
low investors' interest during the eight auctions as a result of 
the steadily declining discounts on Philippine debt paper in the 
secondary market. The MB, however, resumed the program's 
implementation in January this year. 
  At present, outstanding registered foreign investments under 
the program amount to about $398 million. 
  Prior to the liberalization, investments under the 
conversion 
program were subject to a restrictive repayment schedule. 
"Principal capital originally could not be repatriated except on 
a five-year staggered basis commencing not earlier than three or 
five years after the original investment was made, depending on 
whether it is classified as preferred or less preferred 
investment. For a less preferred investment, dividends were 
also subject to a four-year freeze period," the Bangko Sentral 
said. 
  Mr. Singson said the move was likewise aimed at easing the 
continuing upsurge in dollar inflows which has been buoying up 
the peso exchange value since the first quarter of this year. 
  With the dwindling amount of foreign investments utilizing 
the debt-to-equity approach, some bankers doubted whether the 
volume of dollars that will be siphoned out from the system via 
the scheme will be that significant. 
  A chief executive officer of one of the resident foreign 
banks in the country told BUSINESS WORLD while the move sends a 
positive signal to foreign investors, it remains to be seen 
whether others at this stage would want to sell out with the 
relaxation in the repayment of dividends. 
  "It usually takes time to find corporate buyers so the 
reaction time will be long," he said.

    [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok dailies, NAEO NA and THAI 
RAT, carry editorials discussing the current political crisis 
initiated by Chalat Worachat's hunger strike and worsened by 
rallies in support of Chalat's demands, a motion proposed by 
Phalang Tham MP's seeking to draft a new Constitution, and the 
controversy over the role of the Phalang Tham Party as a partner 
in the coalition government. 
  NAEO NA of 21 June carries on page 3 a 600-word editorial 
entitled: "The Government Should Make it Clear." It asks the 
government to make uncertainties clear by telling the people 
what it is going to do -- resign, dissolve the House of 
Representatives, reshuffle the cabinet, or pursue the 
administration without making any changes. The editorial says 
"The government should make clear to the public what the option 
is and provide reasons instead of leaving the people guessing." 
If it does not want to resign, dissolve the House, or reshuffle 
the cabinet the government must arrange for a discussion among 
the coalition parties in order to determine the Phalang Tham 
Party's role. 
  "If the majority wants the Phalang Tham Party to be left 
out, 
the government must then expel the party from the coalition as 
soon as possible in order to end the ongoing confusion. But if 
the government believes the Phalang Tham ministers are capable 
and cannot afford to lose them, the government should be bold 
enough to inform everyone. The current political confusion will 
never end unless the government acts decisively," the editorial 
says. 
  THAI RAT of 21 June carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial 
entitled: "Let the Parliament Settle the Controversy." It 
states that activists backing Chalat's cause are entitled, under 
democratic freedom, to pursue the struggle to support the motion 
of the Phalang Tham MP's. There are others, however, who think 
differently. "In a democratic society, conflicts of opinion 
should be settled through compromise. It is impossible for a 
certain group to win without giving concessions. In the present 
situation, we think there are still several options available. 
Regarding the Constitution, the parliament has already set up a 
special committee to scrutinize proposed amendments. The 
committee is doing its duty now; MP's can propose whatever 
amendments they deem appropriate," the paper says. 
  Besides, the president of the parliament has formed a 
democracy development team comprising representatives of the 
people from all walks of life to plan a more democratic 
Constitution. This committee should be able to work with the 
parliamentary committee. Meanwhile, the motion of 21 Phalang 
Tham Party MP's could be tabled on the parliament agenda for 
debate. "This is the best way to achieve a compromise to solve 
the problem. The parliament is thus given the role of ruling on 
the Phalang Tham motion. Its ruling should be final," the paper 
says.

  [Text] The cabinet yesterday approved a budget for 1994-95 
that will see spending in the provinces rise to 58 per cent of 
the total Bt715 billion expenditure, up from 44 per cent in the 
previous year. 
  The budget, which will be debated by Parliament early next 
month, will also see a record jump in spending to improve 
education and health care, where the percentage of the total 
budget will rise from 16 to 29 per cent. 
  "This budget will allocate the greatest amount of money ever 
to the provinces," said Deputy Commerce Minister Churin 
Laksanawisit, a Democrat. 
  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the budget bill is 
expected to go before Parliament on July 6 and is not expected 
to be altered much. 
  The cabinet approved a balanced budget of Bt715 billion, 
14.4 
per cent more than the previous year, when spending was geared 
to generate a small deficit. 
  The amount being allotted to the provinces in the 1995 
budget 
will be 58 per cent of the total, or Bt150.6 billion. 
  This is designed to be a serious and effective means of 
promoting provincial development," Tharin said. 
  The amount aimed at solving water shortages is Bt37.2 
billion; for increasing the income of farmers, Bt26.3 billion; 
for industrial development in the provinces, Bt4 billion; and 
for basic services in the provinces, Bt83.1 billion. 
  The second largest item in the budget is education and 
health 
care, where spending is 29 per cent of the total, up from 16 per 
cent in 1993-94. The education budget is Bt16 billion, while 
public health is Bt60.67 billion. 
  The third largest item is for natural resources and 
environmental development, accounting for eight per cent of the 
total, compared to four per cent the previous year. The amount 
is Bt19.9 billion, with the environment budget set at Bt6.7 
billion. 
  The budget for solving traffic problems and rehabilitating 
Bangkok will fall to two per cent from three per cent, or Bt9 
billion. 
  The government will spend three per cent of the budget for 
the development of human resources, technology and trade.

  [Text] Thailand's key economic indicators signalled 
favourable performance during the first five months of this 
year, creating the impression that the country's annual economic 
growth target of 8 percent can be achieved according to 
Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa. 
  The results belie a general mood that the country's economy 
is not performing as well as earlier expected as the inflation 
figure is much higher than projected and investment has slowed. 
  The stock market, in particular has posted sluggish trading 
activity since the beginning of the year, when the SET [Stock 
Exchange of Thailand] Index plunged from its peak 1,700-point 
level to the current level of 1,350 points. The market's 
bearishness was partly attributed to the country's continued 
political paralysis. 
  Mr Aphisit said after the Council of Economic Ministers 
meeting that the overall picture of the Thai economy during the 
period was favourable as exports, investment and tax collection 
were in good shape. 
  Inflation was within manageable limits at 4.8 percent, but 
Mr 
Aphisit said that by the end of this year, the annual inflation 
rate should not exceed the government target of 4.2 percent. 
  "We are trying to control inflation and if necessary, 
monetary measures may be initiated to bring inflation to within 
4.2 percent for 1994. There is now a tight liquidity problem in 
the financial system because banks have lent much more than 
deposits mobilised. Apparently, investment is improving," he 
said. 
  During this period, a total of 362 projects valued at 
144,635 
million baht had sought promotional privileges from the Board of 
Investment, representing a fair increase in terms of projects 
and amount of investment to be made, compared to that of the 
same period of the preceding year when there were 228 projects 
applying for such privileges. 
  Mr Aphisit did not give the exact figures on how much those 
projects would invest but said main investment was in the 
construction and oil business and that Japanese investment 
during the period doubled that of the same period in the 
preceding year. 
  Applications for setting up new factories in the provinces 
during January-May rose 74 percent over those in the same period 
last year. Again, Mr Aphisit did not give the details on the 
figures. 
  He said overall tax collection by the Government during the 
period rose 15.6 percent, implying that economic growth should 
reach the 8 percent target. 
  Thai exports in the first five months this year increased 
21.4 percent over the same period last year reaching 421,800 
million baht --accounting for 39.6 percent of the country's 
export target forecast at 1,065,000 million baht, according to 
Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap. 
  Mr Chaiyot, who quoted the Business Economics Department's 
preliminary figures, said exports in the first five months 
totalled 421,800 million baht, up 21.4 percent from last year's 
347,567.8 million baht. 
  He said imports increased 10.1 percent from the same period 
last year to 519,600 million baht. The imports increased at a 
smaller rate because the country had imported crude oil instead 
of refined oil. 
  Therefore, the trade deficit in the first five months 
decreased by 21.3 percent to 97,800 million. The country's 
trade deficit in the first five months last year was 124,318 
million baht. 
  Mr Chaiyot said agricultural exports reached 72,000 million 
baht, up 16.4 percent over last year, while industrial products 
increased 19.7 percent to 284,200 million baht. 
  The major markets were still the traditional ones, including 
the United States (up 11.8 percent), Japan (up 36.1 percent), 
ASEAN (up 61.2 percent), particularly Singapore. 
  However, exports to the European Union increased by only 3 
percent due to the slow economic growth in the union, 
particularly in Germany. 
  Mr Chaiyot said Thailand had diversified its exports to 
other 
regions which have great potential, including Indochina (up 54.6 
percent), the Middle East (up 8.4 percent), Eastern Europe (up 
5.2 percent) and Australia (up 4.7 percent). 
  Garments were the largest export item valued at 36,500 
million baht, up 3 percent from last year. The small growth was 
attributed to problems exporting to the United States due to the 
delay in the extension of a bilateral agreement. 
  The second largest export item was computers and parts 
totalling 31,100 million baht, up 24.4 percent. 
  The third largest item was frozen shrimp totalling 19,000 
million baht, up 50.9 percent over the same period last year. 
  For the period, Thailand exported gems and jewelry worth 
18,000 million baht (up 4 percent), rice worth 16,900 million 
baht (up 42 percent), integrated circuits worth 16,800 million 
baht (up 20.7 percent), rubber worth 13,382 million baht (up 13 
percent), plastic products worth 13,000 million baht (up 43.4 
percent), shoes and parts worth 11,950 million baht (up 5 
percent) and canned seafood worth 11,000 million baht (up 26 
percent). 
  Mr Chaiyot said it is likely that the country's 1994 exports 
will be higher than the target of 1,065,000 million baht as the 
Government promotes exports by setting more trade centers and 
commercial counsellors' offices abroad.

  [Text] Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaisit disclosed that his 
province and Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey Province have agreed to 
sign an accord on opening the Khlong Luk-Poipet border crossing 
point on 22 June. The opening will follow immediately after the 
signing to allow people of both countries to cross and trade as 
normal. Sa Kaeo Province closed the crossing point on 9 April. 
  According to the governor, the Cambodian Government approved 
the points in the accord as proposed by Sa Kaeo Province for 
both countries to comply. The draft accord mainly deals with 
operating hours, crossing procedures for people and vehicles, 
and types of goods which Thailand wants traders to give 
priority, particularly goods which Thailand wants to promote in 
Cambodia. Tax rates and collection procedures for goods 
transiting the crossing point are also set. 
  The governor said the opening of the crossing point will be 
temporary at this time. The Thai side wanted the opening to be 
permanent, but the Cambodian side was not ready. He said the 
Cambodian side assured the safety of Thai visitors in Poipet. 
If the situation becomes dangerous, his province can order 
closure for safety and national security reasons.

  [Text] A second Pakistani wanted by police for questioning 
in connection with the suspected plot to harm the Nepalese Crown 
Prince has offered to turn himself in, a Special Branch police 
source said yesterday. 
  The source said the fugitive, identified as Mohamad Javet, 
had telephoned the Special Branch to say he was ready to 
surrender. 
  The source said Mr Javet insisted he was innocent of any 
involvement in a plot against Crown Prince Dipendra bir Bikram 
Shah Dev. 
  The Nepalese Embassy in Bangkok also issued a statement last 
night saying the arrest of the other suspect, Shakil Ammad, had 
no link whatsoever with the Nepalese Crown Prince or his visit 
to AIT [Asian Institute of Technology]. It said the news item 
was "misleading". 
  The 22-year-old Crown Prince arrived in Thailand on Sunday 
to 
attend a four-day geography course at the Asian Institute of 
Technology before beginning an official visit from June 24-27. 
  Mr Ammad, who is currently being held in police custody, 
claimed he knew Mr Javet for only one day, said the police 
source. 
  He said Mr Ammad claimed he wanted to study at the AIT and 
his entry to the campus was aided by Mr Javet. 
  Special Branch commissioner Narongwit Thaithong said 
yesterday he had contacted the Pakistani and Nepalese embassies 
in Bangkok to check the background of Mr Ammad. 
  He said the minister counsellor at the Nepalese Embassy, Mr 
Pushkaraj Bhandari, met him yesterday and was present during the 
questioning of Mr Ammad. The minister counsellor also pledged 
support for the police investigation, he said. 
  The vice consul of the Pakistani Embassy, Riez Seqi, was 
also 
present during the questioning. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Narongwit said an initial report yet to be 
verified stated Mr Ammad's elder brother was a former student at 
AIT and is now working as an engineer in Pakistan.

  [Text] Regarding a report that the Malaysian Islamic Center 
has set up a fanatic center, or Al-Arqam in Bangkok, Commander 
of the 4th Army Region Lieutenant General Kitti Ratanachaya said 
the national level agency, or the Foreign Ministry, and senior 
officials concerned will have to investigate the report. His 
command, which is a local unit, does not have much information. 
  Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi said during an 
interview given to foreign journalists on 14 June that Thailand 
must be careful because the group will carry out its mission 
regardless of the status of relations between Thailand and 
Malaysia. 
  Speaking to journalists on 21 June, Lt. Gen. Kitti said the 
Malaysian minister probably made the remark out of concern about 
relations with Thailand. He said the Malaysian side continues 
to feel that relations between the two countries further have to 
be strengthened. For example, the Trilateral Cooperation 
Project will not materialize without good cooperation among the 
countries concerned. 
  According to a report from the Foreign Ministry, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has directed the Thai envoy to 
Kuala Lumpur to point out that Thailand allows free choice of 
religion and that followers of any religion carrying out 
religious activities within the scope of the law will be given 
due protection. Thailand has no intention of interfering in 
other countries' internal affairs, particularly in neighboring 
countries. Regarding the reported training of the 
aforementioned group in Thailand, Thailand wants evidence of 
such conduct and is ready to provide cooperation to deal with 
the matter.

  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, says the 
closure of three news magazines by the Indonesian Government is 
an internal matter for Indonesia. But Mr. Keating's office in 
Canberra said Australia was a strong supporter of freedom of the 
press which was regarded as a basic right. A spokesman said Mr. 
Keating would go ahead with his planned trip to Jakarta despite 
a call by a leading Indonesian human rights lawyer to cancel the 
trip following the banning of the magazines by the government of 
President Suharto. Michael Marr reports from Jakarta. 
  [Begin Marr recording] The head of Indonesia's Legal Aid 
Institute, Adnan Buyung Nasution, has urged Mr. Keating to 
cancel his trip to Jakarta which is scheduled for next week to 
protest against the closure of the three news weeklies. The 
leading human rights lawyer has also called on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to call off his planned visit to Indonesia due to 
take place during the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum's leaders 
summit later this year. The government has yet to fully reveal 
why it banned TEMPO, the country's leading news magazine, and 
the popular publications DETIK and EDITOR. However, all three 
magazines have recently published articles critical of the 
country's research and technology minister, Dr. Yusuf Habibie, 
who is a confidant of President Suharto. Pro-democracy 
activists have been quick to declare the closure of the 
publications as a major setback to openness in Indonesia. So 
far, authorities have yet to say whether or not the bans will be 
permanent. [end recording]

  [Text] Sydney, June 18 (AFP) -- State ministers said 
Saturday they were outraged when the Australian Government 
barred them from visiting a immigrants' detention centre. 
  Two conservative Liberal members of the New South Wales 
state 
parliament invited MPs to visit the Villawood Detention Centre 
in western Sydney, where they said Cambodian boatpeople had been 
held for up to four years. 
  State Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs Minister Michael 
Photios organised the Monday tour with colleague Brad Hazzard 
for delegates from all parties to inspect conditions. 
  The New South Wales state government is a conservative 
alliance of Liberal and National parties while the Australian 
Government of Prime Minister Paul Keating is Labor. 
  Photios said he was outraged when Australian Immigration 
Minister Nick Bolkus formally denied access to the delegation of 
more than 20 state MPs, mostly state government parliamentarians. 
  A spokeswoman for Bolkus said the minister had written to 
Photios and Hazzard saying the MPs were playing political games 
with the issue and under the circumstances he was not prepared 
to accommodate the request. 
  She said Bolkus first heard of the proposed visit through 
the 
daily SYDNEY MORNING HERALD newspaper following an approach to 
the paper by Hazzard. 
  There was "quite a big lag" between that report and Photios' 
letter to Bolkus' office asking for permission to visit the 
centre, indicating to the minister that it was a political 
exercise, the spokeswoman said. 
  "He did point out to Photios ... that a whole range of 
people do have access to Villawood including all the relative 
support agencies and non-government agencies," she said. 
  "People can also visit on the invitation of the detainees 
themselves." 
  Photios said he understood seven long-term detainees, mostly 
women and children, were being held at Villawood, while 16 
others remained in a similar centre at Port Hedland in Western 
Australia's north. 
  "If it is good enough for Australian parliamentarians to 
monitor the process of democracy in South Africa, it is good 
enough for state parliamentarians to monitor what happens in 
their own backyards," Photios said. 
  Bolkus' spokeswoman said only one Cambodian boatperson 
remained at Villawood and he was booked on a flight back to 
Cambodia within the next week or so. 
  Photios said the Australian Government allowed thousands of 
illegal immigrants to move freely around Australia while they 
waited for decisions on their status. 
  However, he said the boat people were detained because they 
had arrived illegally when, at the time, there was no legal way 
for them to get to Australia. 
  "Jailing them, while people who overstay tourist and student 
visas are not detained, is the height of hypocrisy," Photios 
said.

  [Text] The leader of Fiji's opposition coalition, Jai Ram 
Reddy, says the opposition will continue to keep a careful watch 
on developments in the country's Parliament. Speaking upon the 
opposition's return to Parliament after a two-day boycott, Mr. 
Reddy said they ended their boycott in the interest of Fiji's 
economy and the planned review of Fiji's racially biased 
Constitution. 
  The leader of the opposition Labor Party, Mahendra Chowdury, 
earlier said that it was more important to concentrate on 
changing the Constitution, which currently guarantees ethnic 
Fijians political dominance over Indo-Fijians. 
  The opposition boycott was fueled by a statement by Prime 
Minister Sitiveni Rabuka that he could not guarantee against a 
third and more violent coup than the two which brought him to 
power in 1987.

  [Text] Wellington, June 21 (AFP) -- New Zealand will find 
it difficult to monitor what happens to people who speak to a 
group of its MPs when they visit the disputed Indonesian 
province of East Timor, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Tuesday. 
  Bolger's answer in parliament came in response to a question 
on the upcoming visit by MP Phil Goff. 
  "Will it be a condition of that visit that the delegation be 
free to speak with whomever they wish, and given Amnesty 
International's warnings on past experience about victimisation 
of those who speak to such delegations, will it be a condition 
that those spoken to will not be subject to subsequent forms of 
reprisal?" Goff said. 
  Bolger, who visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta 
earlier this year after a majority of New Zealand MPs signed a 
petition protesting alleged human rights abuses by Indonesia in 
the former Portuguese colony, said he believed Suharto would 
welcome the visit by four or five MPs. 
  But, he added, "Its going to be very difficult for us to in 
anyway to control or monitor that." 
  Bolger said he had suggested the MPs also visit other 
Indonesian provinces during their August 18-September 13 trip, 
including West Timor, for comparison purposes. 
  During Bolger's visit to Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign 
Minister 
Ali Alatas claimed New Zealand parliamentarians had only a 
shallow understanding of the situation in East Timor, annexed by 
Indonesia in 1975 in a move still not recognised by the United 
Nations.

  [Text] Wellington, June 21 (AFP) -- Foreign investors are 
continuing to buy into New Zealand faster than locals are buying 
assets overseas, government statistics showed Tuesday as the 
country's net international investment position deteriorated for 
the fifth year. 
  The statistics show that at the end of March 1993, the net 
position was 54.3 billion New Zealand dollars (32.08 billion US 
dollars) in deficit, 8.1 billion dollars worse than the previous 
March and the fifth year of decline. 
  This flowed from a decrease of 1.4 billion dollars to 31.7 
billion dollars in overseas assets held by New Zealand investors 
and an increase of 6.7 billion dollars to 86 billion dollars in 
foreign-held assets in New Zealand. 
  The 6.7 billion dollars increase in New Zealand's total 
international liabilities stemmed from rises in both foreign 
equity holdings in New Zealand companies and in borrowings 
overseas. 
  Equity rose to 23.2 billion dollars at the end of March 1993 
from 18.5 billion dollars a year earlier, mainly due to a 4.6 
billion dollar increase in foreign direct investment involving 
25 percent or more of the voting shares of a company. 
  New Zealand investment abroad amounted to 21.7 billion 
dollars at March 31, 1993, compared with 24.8 billion dollars a 
year earlier. 
  In contrast, foreign investment in New Zealand increased to 
76 billion dollars from 71 billion dollars.

revealed that talks between government officials, Bougainville 
leaders, and rebels had been canceled earlier this week because 
the leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army could not 
attend. The Port Moresby based newspaper, THE NATIONAL, says Mr. 
Wingti told us that the Honiara meeting did not go ahead as 
planned because the government decided that Francis Ona and Sam 
Kouna had to be involved. He said the government did not want 
to waste its time by talking to a variety of people and then not 
getting any results. Mr. Wingti reportedly also said that the 
government would not make any announcements until talks between 
the leaders on both sides were over.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senior Lieutenant General Dao Dinh Luyen, </F>
member of the party Central Committee, chief of the Vietnam 
People's Army General Staff, and deputy to the Ninth National 
Assembly, by QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondent Mai Nam Thang; date 
and place not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] According to many people, our 
country's existing national defense law and policy are 
inadequate, inconsistent, and "backward" compared with the 
socioeconomic situation. Therefore, all echelons and sectors, 
especially grassroots establishments, face numerous difficulties 
in implementing national defense tasks. What is your opinion 
about this issue? 
  [Dao Dinh Luyen] In implementing the principle of "state 
control over society by means of law and constant efforts to 
strengthen the socialist legal system" in all domains, including 
national defense, in its capacity as a state organ in charge of 
overseeing national defense, the Ministry of National Defense 
has suggested that the National Assembly, the Council of State 
(now the National Assembly Standing Committee), and the 
Government review and adopt many important legal documents 
directly relating to national defense tasks, like the Laws on 
Selective Service and People's Army Officers and the Regulations 
on Safeguarding National Defense Projects and Military 
Installations. At the same time, it has coordinated with the 
various ministries and sectors in promulgating many 
interministerial and intersectorial directives to guide the 
implementation of the aforementioned legal documents. It can be 
said that those national defense-related laws and regulations 
have gradually been supplemented to meet the requirements of the 
new situation. Nonetheless, it is necessary to admit that the 
existing national defense law and policy are still inadequate 
and "backward" compared with the changes for the better in the 
socioeconomic situation and with the requirements of the current 
national defense tasks aimed at protecting the Fatherland and 
socialist regime. Many legal documents were promulgated a long 
time ago and applied to the system of state subsidization and 
management by the central government and in the situation 
prevailing during the national salvation struggle. Given the 
current situation, they are no longer appropriate. This very 
drawback has to some extent affected the implementation of 
national defense tasks by the various echelons, sectors, 
localities, and grassroots establishments. This situation 
requires adequate investment to formulate laws to 
institutionalize national defense policies and lines in the the 
party's resolutions. As an immediate objective, it is necessary 
to resolve major issues as follows: 
  -- Continued efforts are needed to improve and perfect the 
national defense budget and set local level-national defense 
expenditures and funds at an early date. 
  -- Steps must be taken to formulate a policy on science 
and technology in support of national defense. 
  -- Plans must be worked out to resolve the problems 
concerning the rear-army policy and military mobilization 
preparedness. 
  It is important to work out a well-defined management, 
inspection, and reward mechanism suitable to the implementation 
of national defense tasks at all echelons to ensure uniform 
application of national defense policies and lines. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any differences between the 
amendments and supplements to the Law on Selective Service this 
time and those in 1990? What are the basic contents and general 
standpoints of the amendments and supplements this time? 
  [Dao Dinh Luyen] The existing Law on Selective Service was 
adopted by the Seventh National Assembly on 30 December 1981. 
The Eighth National Assembly amended or supplemented a number 
of articles of this law on 21 December 1990. However, in view 
of the need to build and develop the army and consolidate 
national defense and security arrangements to effectively defend 
our Fatherland and regime, we must conduct a comprehensive study 
to formulate a national defense law that covers many fundamental 
issues relating to the building of an all-people national 
defense system and people's Armed Forces... The formulation of 
such an important legal document requires time and other laws 
and regulations. Given the changes for the better in all 
aspects of the national situation, especially in the economic 
field, we must amend or supplement a number of essential 
articles that affect most directly the implementation of 
citizens' selective service. 
  The key contents of amendments or supplements to the Law on 
Selective Service this time focus on three main issues as 
follows: 
  1. Defining the responsibilities of economic organizations, 
including private business establishments, share-holding 
corporations, limited partnership corporations, joint business 
ventures with foreign countries... toward the implementation of 
the Law on Selective Service of the Vietnamese state. 
  2. Further clarifying the responsibilities of the local 
authorities and the Selective Service Council at all levels 
toward the implementation of the Law on Selective Service. 
  3. Supplementing or amending a number of systems and 
policies to make them consistent with the situation and help 
strengthen the building and development of the army. 
  [Correspondent] Why does the current Law on Selective 
Service not stipulate the obligations for youth who do not serve 
in the army? In fact there are a large number of youth in this 
category who pose a pressing problem in the annual troop 
induction work. What are the measures to resolve this problem to 
ensure social justice? 
  [Dao Dinh Luyen] To ensure social justice for those who 
serve 
in the army and those who do not is an essential task. However, 
this is a difficult and complicated problem that cannot be 
comprehensively and definitely resolved overnight. 
  For example, it is very difficult to organize production 
activities for youth who are not recruited for the army, 
especially when we still need more jobs for workers in society. 
Besides, the state must spend a lot of money to handle this 
issue. But if we decide that those who do not want to serve the 
army must contribute money in compensation for their military 
service, then we must be very careful to ensure justice in this 
regard. 
  As far as the Law on Selective Service is concerned, it is 
concentrated only on the policy and a mechanism aimed at 
improving the daily life of troops in active service, discharged 
soldiers, and those who are classified as a reserved force so as 
to ensure justice for these people. As a result, I would like 
to suggest that the state formulate and promulgate a regulation 
on appropriate contributions by youth who do not serve in the 
army in the cause of national defense and construction. 
  [Correspondent] Public opinion at present is very indignant 
about those who violate the Law on Selective Service (those who 
are dodging, ignoring the military service obligation, and 
deserting their units) and are not seriously dealt with by the 
law. Why is there still a "lenient" policy on this issue and 
what are the measures to resolve this problem in the days ahead? 
  [Dao Dinh Luyen] The Law on Selective Service stipulates 
various measures for punishment in this regard, while the 
Criminal Code also clearly defines measures to deal with law 
violations and punishments for violators. In reality, we have 
on many occasions punished and reeducated those who violated the 
law. However, in some cases, serious and prompt action was not 
taken against them. The following are some of my observations: 
  -- The local administrations, such as village (ward) and 
district (precinct) administrative units and other local law 
enforcement agencies, must take the first serious action against 
those who have dodged or ignored the military service 
obligation. In some places and at certain times, the agencies 
concerned in some localities have failed to satisfactorily carry 
out this task. Many responsible agencies did not optimally 
exercise their authority to help the local administration deal 
with those who violate the law. 
  -- In the army, generally speaking, military units and 
commanders of legal agencies in the army have promptly and 
severely dealt with those who violated rules and regulations. 
One obvious problem at present, however, is that we have failed 
to deal severely with those who have deserted their units. This 
is because we do not have a unified measure and a close 
coordination between the army and the local administration to 
carry out this task. Although we have taken a number of 
actions, such as imposing fines or labor punishments against the 
violators, these measures have not been officially defined in a 
uniform manner and have therefore failed to deal severely with 
the violators, while creating indignation among the people. 
  To resolve this problem, in the near future, the Ministry of 
National Defense will coordinate with responsible agencies to 
formulate regulations to deal with violators and submit them to 
the state for approval. The ministry will, on the other hand, 
cooperate more closely with the local administration and other 
law enforcement agencies to monitor and deal promptly and 
severely with those who violate the law. 
  [Correspondent] What policy and measures should the State 
and 
the Ministry of National Defense have to make the Law on 
Selective Service (after it was amended, supplemented, and 
approved by the National Assembly at this session) widely known 
by the public, firmly grasped by sectors concerned, and 
effectively implemented by law enforcement agencies? 
  [Dao Dinh Luyen] The law on Selective Service is one of the 
key laws of the State. A large number of people are subjected 
to this law while its implementation is on a nationwide-scale. 
Improper implementation of the law may impact on the material 
and spiritual life of the people and the mind and attitude of 
cadres and combatants. As a result, supervision of the 
implementation of this law must be close and careful. To 
seriously and effectively implement the law, proper attention 
should be paid to the following key tasks: 
  1. It is essential to improve national defense education and 
enhance the military service obligation awareness among the 
people, youth, and reserved forces in various units of the party 
organizations, state agencies, and mass societies so as to 
motivate them to enthusiastically implement and abide by the 
law. Efforts must be made to combine the education task with 
that of motivating the people to respect and abide by the state 
laws. 
  2. We must strive to uphold the responsibility of various 
echelons, sectors, localities, and military units in 
implementing the law under the unified guidance of party 
committees and the management of administration agencies. 
Efforts must be made to bring into full play the responsibility 
of branches, sectors, and mass organizations in this regard 
while upholding the staff role of military agencies in 
localities. Commanders of various army units must uphold their 
responsibility in strengthening education and training and 
improving the daily life of their units. 
  3. Efforts must be made to satisfactorily implement the 
army's rules and regulations; and to continue to study, review, 
and supplement various essential lines and policies to encourage 
cadres and combatants to actively build the army and the 
reserved force while enthusiastically improving their training 
and standing ready for any assignments.

just issued Communique No. 20 as follows: 
  On 21 June, the National Assembly held a plenary session in

and Pham Nguyen Tan of Hai Hung; Bui Huu Hai of Vinh Phu; Nguyen 
Khoa Kim Moi and Nguyen Dinh Ngo of Thua Thien-Hue; Nguyen 
Khuong of Binh Thuan; Pham Van Kiet and Bui Van Hoanh of Can 
Tho; Ha Thi Khiet of Tuyen Quang; Le Minh Chau, Doan Le Huong, 
Le Khac Binh, and Vu Tuat Viet of Ho Chi Minh City; Dang Khoi 
and Vu Mao of Nam Ha; Nguyen Viet Dung, Nguyen Hoa Binh, Tang

and Nguyen Van Hieu of Ha Tay; Le Duc Binh of Ninh Binh; Pham 
Thi Son of Ba Ria-Vung Tau; Nguyen Nhieu Coc of Hoa Binh; and Ha 
Dang of Phu Yen. 
  During the debate, Minister Phan Ngoc Tuong, chairman of the 
Government Organization and Personnel Commission, on behalf of 
the law drafting committee, further explained some issues 
queried by the National Assembly deputies. The National 
Assembly voted to pass some articles on which there were still 
differing views and some chapters of the draft law before 
passing the entire revised law on election of people's council. 
  Then Nguyen Van Yeu, member of the National Assembly 
Secretariat, on behalf of the law drafting committee, the 
investigation committee, and the National Assembly Secretariat 
read a report compiling National Assembly deputies' views on 
amendments to Chapter Two of the revised law on the organization 
of people's councils and people's committees. 
  After Deputies Le Duc Binh of Ninh Binh, Phan Quang of Thai 
Binh, Nguyen Thanh Chuong of Thanh Hoa, Ha Thai Binh of Soc 
Trang, Ma Dien Cu of Binh Thuan, Y Ngong Niek Dam of Dac Lac, Vo 
Nguyen Quang of Thua Thien-Hue, Tran Thi Le Thu of Binh Dinh, 
and Phan Minh Tanh of Dong Thap completed their statements, the 
National Assembly voted to pass Chapter Two before passing the 
entire text of the revised law on the organization of people's 
councils and people's committees. 
  The revised law on the organization of people's councils and 
people's committees and the revised law on election of people's 
councils that have been passed by the National Assembly are the 
two important laws that help to revamp in one step the 
organization and activity of the people's councils and people's 
committees at all levels. These two laws will help to further 
perfect the legislative system for the organization of the 
administration mechanism. 
  On 22 June, the National Assembly will work in the 
conference 
hall.

  [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
voiced confidence Tuesday that North Korean strongman Kim 
Il-song will not be able to avoid a summit this time, adding 
that the two leaders need only to decide on the time and place. 
  "The summit proposal Kim made through (Former U.S. President 
Jimmy) Carter is apparently sincere, not just a gesture," Kim 
said during dinner with ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
lawmakers at the presidential mansion. 
  "We expected this to happen and we have been preparing a 
long 
time for it," he said. "We can meet anywhere, anytime to discuss 
anything." 
  Carter met with Kim Il-song in Pyongyang last week and 
relayed the message to Kim Yong-sam that the North Korean leader 
wants an inter-Korean summit. 
  "Kim Il-song obviously became impatient," the South Korean 
president said, noting Seoul's growing ties with the world's 
four most powerful nations. 
  Seoul proposed a working-level contact on June 28 to prepare 
for the summit. Pyongyang has yet to respond. 
  "Now that we have accepted Kim Il-song's proposal, the only 
thing left is the time and place," said Kim. "We will decide our 
government position as soon as North Korea responds."

  [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said on Wednesday he believes an inter-Korean summit 
meeting and the third-round U.S.-North Korea talks would take 
place before long. 
  In an interview at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Seoul, 
Minister Han said, "As can be seen in North Korea's reply today 
on our proposal for a preparatory meeting, the North Koreans' 
sincerity seems higher than any other time in the past." 
  Han said South Korea does not oppose any improvement by the 
United States of its relations with North Korea. "We see no 
reason why we should oppose North Korea being recognized as a 
normal country duly fulfilling international obligations and 
engaging in normal diplomatic activities," the minister said. 
  He added, however, that sanctions would continue to be 
promoted at the U.N. Security Council until North Korea's "good 
intention" could be verified through the expected South-North 
summit and third- round U.S.-North Korea talks. 
  Regarding the issue of delving into the nuclear past of 
North 
Korea, Han said the question cannot be overlooked under any 
circumstances. "This is something on which light should be shed 
without fail through, for example, U.S.-North Korea talks," he 
said. 
  Stating that both the inter-Korean summit and third-round 
U.S.- North Korea talks are important, Minister Han said that if 
either of the talks fail, there would be no way but to revert to 
the course of taking sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- The leading opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) urged Wednesday that the proposed 
South-North Korean summit be held before a third round of North 
Korea-U.S. high-level talks, which it expected to come next 
month. 
  DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, commenting on foreign media reports 
that North Korean President Kim Il-song has suggested Aug. 15 as 
a possible date for the historic talks, said, "the earlier the 
South- North Korean summit came, the better it would be. 
  "Even if it's just for demonstrating national independence, 
the summit should be held prior to the third-round talks between 
Pyongyang and Washington." 
  The party's spokesman, Rep. Pak Chi-won, said in a 
statement: 
"We believe it was natural for the summit leaders of the two 
sides to meet prior to the third-round talks to resolve the 
nuclear issue from the perspective of national independence, so 
that we see President Kim (Il-song)'s idea, revealed in an 
indirect way, of holding it on Aug. 15 as inappropriate." 
  Noting that his party is aware of North Korea's political 
schedule to hold a "pan-national rally" on Aug. 15, Pak said, 
"it is our position that the inter-Korean summit should not be 
abused politically under any circumstances."

  [Text] North Korea has notified that it accepts our 
government's proposal for making a preliminary contact between 
the South and North to discuss the procedure of the South-North 
summit talks at the Freedom House in our side's area at 
Panmunjom at 10:00 AM [0100 GMT] on 28 June. 
  On the telephone line now is a reporter who is covering this 
issue. Reporter Kim Chong-chin. What is included in the 
message from the North Korean side? 
  [Begin Kim Chong-chin recording] Yes. In a telephone message 
sent to Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok today, Kang Song-san, premier 
of the North Korean State Administration Council, gave an answer 
to the effect that a preliminary contact for the South-North 
summit talks be made at the Freedom House in the South's side at 
Panmunjom at 10:00 on 28 June, as proposed by our side on 20 
June. 
  For this, North Korea disclosed that it will send three 
delegates headed by a vice premier-level official and four 
entourage members. In today's telephone message, North Korea 
said that it welcomes and agrees to the South side's proposal 
because the acute situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula 
makes it all the more urgent than ever before for both the South 
and the North to hold top-level summit talks. 
  North Korea pointed out that the holding of South-North 
summit talks will be a historical event brining the joy of 
national reconciliation and unity to the 70 million fellow 
countrymen and giving a new hope of peace, and independent and 
peaceful reunification of the country. 
  In this connection, the dialogue between the South and 
North, 
which was discontinued because of the 19 March remarks about 
engulfing Seoul in a sea of flame, will resume after about three 
months. 
  For the first time since the national division, both the 
South and North sides will have official discussions on summit 
talks. 
  One National Unification Board [NUB] official said: It is 
fortunate to see North Korea accept our side's proposal as it 
is. We can construe this as a sign with which we can judge in an 
affirmative way the intention of the North's side to see an 
early realization of the summit talks. 
  Meanwhile, in the telephone message, North Korea did not 
mention the list of the delegates. In view of the past 
practices, it is expected that there is the high possibility 
that it will notify us of the list one day before the contact, 
that is, on around 27 June. 
  Although our side's delegates have not been confirmed yet, 
Yi 
Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB, will 
surely be the head delegate. 
  I have so far reported the news report that a preliminary 
contact for the South-North summit talks will be realized at 
Panmunjom on 28 June because of the North Korean side's 
acceptance of our proposal. I have been reporting from the NUB. 
This is Kim Chong-chin, KBS News, from the NUB. [end recording]

  [Text] A high-ranking government official has termed as an 
affirmative sign the realization of the summit talks that North 
Korea agreed to hold a preliminary contact for the South-North 
summit talks at Panmunjom on 28 June, as proposed by our side. 
  This official said: North Korea has replied to our side's 
proposal as quickly as in two days in the form of a telephone 
message in the name of the prime minister--in the same manner as 
we did--without any revision to our proposal. I think that this 
confirms, first, the sincerity of the North Korean side which 
put forth the proposal for the summit talks. 
  The official said: The fact that the reply message is very 
businesslike--without any harangue or hidden meaning--makes us 
have a hopeful expectation for the success of the talks. 
  Another government official concerned said: The only 
procedure left before the preliminary talks is for the South and 
North to exchange lists of delegates and entourage members. 
  Regarding the selection of the delegates to the preliminary 
talks, the official said: The two sides will fine-tune 
procedures behind closed doors at Panmunjom. I think our side's 
delegation will consist of Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for 
national unification affairs, as the head delegate; and Chong 
Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and 
national security at Chongwadae [presidential offices]; as a 
delegate, and others.

  [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- The government will call 
a unification and national security policy coordination meeting 
Thursday morning to discuss strategy at a preliminary contact 
for the proposed inter-Korean summit and the formation of a 
delegation to the contact. 
  The meeting participants will draw up Seoul's position on 
issues expected to come up at the preliminary contact and 
consider possible proposals by the Northern side. 
  Song Yong-tae, vice national unification minister, said 
Wednesday that the government will give Pyongyang a list of the 
members of Seoul's delegation to the contact and its entourage 
upon obtaining presidential approval and simultaneously make a 
public announcement on formation of the delegation. 
  Song said, however, that the North will not necessarily be 
handed the list on Thursday.

  [Text] At the present phase of dialogue, the United States 
has decided not to take issue with North Korea's past nuclear 
activities for the time being, and the ROK has been examining 
the possibility of revising its policies toward accepting this 
U.S. policy. 
  The United States decided not to probe its nuclear past, 
which includes the extraction of plutonium, because it believed 
that it had already become impossible to measure the spent fuel 
rods and that inspections of the two unreported facilities, 
which are storage facilities, would not bring satisfactory 
results in finding the truth of the North Korean nuclear program. 
  This U.S. policy is reportedly related to the fact that the 
United States gives priority to preventing North Korea from 
pursuing nuclear development, replacing fuel rods, and 
reprocessing them over probing the past of its nuclear 
activities. 
  A ROK Foreign Ministry official said on 21 June: "The United 
States outwardly insists on the policy of pursuing special 
inspections. I know, however, it will not immediately demand 
special inspections because of technological limitations and a 
policy for continuing the present phase of dialogue." He also 
said: "Our government also considers special inspections to be a 
matter requiring political judgment." 
  This official added: "North Korea has so far attached 
greater and greater importance to special inspections of the 
unreported facilities. Therefore, it is expected that North 
Korea will not agree easily to special inspections. Also, there 
is no assurance that any physical evidence will be found in 
special inspections because North Korea may have relocated a 
significant amount of nuclear waste materials elsewhere. This 
is the general conception of the ROK and the United States." In 
this way he made it clear that the government is considering a 
plan to withhold special inspections for the moment. At the 20 
June closed session of the National Assembly's Diplomacy and 
Reunification Committee, Yi Hong- ku, deputy prime minister and 
minister of the National Unification Board, reportedly said that 
the special inspections issue is a matter requiring not 
technological approaches but political judgment. 
  However, the ROK and the United States have not officially 
discussed and announced their plan to "withhold the probe into 
North Korea's nuclear history for the moment." Therefore, the 
United States is expected to refer to special inspections in a 
roundabout way at the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. 
  The ROK Foreign Ministry believes that North Korea processed 
the fuel rods from the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon in 1989 
and accumulated seven to 10 kg of plutonium. This is enough 
plutonium to make one to two small nuclear bombs.

  [Text] As North Korea's nuclear issue has been entering a 
stage of tension, people's anxiety about a war has been 
increasing. Indeed, how much possibility is there for a war to 
break out on the Korean peninsula? 
  Generally speaking, it may be senseless to try to reach a 
"clear-cut" conclusion about the possibility of a war breaking 
out. Perhaps this is why the authorities concerned at the 
Ministry of National Defense [MND] have come up with the 
following projection on North Korea's recent military movements: 
"Whereas there is very little likelihood of a total war 
breaking out," the authorities stress, "the possibility always 
exists that some limited accidental warfare might be provoked." 
  Based on the following data, the MND argues that there is 
little likelihood that a total war might break out: First of 
all, although it has supremacy in terms of the number of troops 
and the amount of weapons, North Korean armed forces are 
ill-prepared to carry out total warfare due to the lack of 
practical exercises on the part of the Navy and Air Force and 
due to the limited logistical stockpile of military supplies and 
ammunition. In particular, what is also important is that North 
Korea's self-supply rate for oil and food-- which are essential 
in a war--is 40 percent and 60 percent respectively. 
  Second, the ROK armed forces and U.S. Forces in Korea have a 
considerable level of combined combat capability of handling the 
initial stages of North Korea's surprise attack. 
  Third, the MND has judged that while the United States is 
firm in its intention to punish North Korea, those 
countries--including China and Russia--which in the past 
supported North Korea, have already stopped providing it with 
military aid, and even if they should continue to do so, would 
be very passive in providing future aid. 
  The MND stated: There is very little likelihood that `a 
second Korean war' will break out due to a combination of North 
Korea's military status, the capability of the ROK and the 
United States to cope with a contingency, and the positions of 
neighboring countries. 
  According to the MND, there are now only about 10 out of 
some 
260 signs which indicate a possibility that a war might break 
out on the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the present tense 
situation does not warrant being worried. 
  But, the MND added: The possibility remains of a limited 
military conflict caused by an accidental provocation which the 
unpredictable North Korean regime might commit with a view to 
finding a breakthrough in the process of solving the nuclear 
crisis. 
  The MND feels, in particular, that we cannot entirely rule 
out the possibility of a limited military conflict escalating 
into large-scale warfare. According to the MND, as far as the 
international community's sanctions against North Korea 
regarding its nuclear issue are concerned, we are actually 
worried that North Korea might try to blockade the five islands, 
including Paeknyong Island, in the West Sea, or bombard the ROK 
Forces stationed near the ceasefire line. 
  Accordingly, the MND has regarded the remarks--which the 
North Korean authorities have recently made--not as the 
expression of their will to provoke a war, but as aimed at 
staging psychological warfare attempted at creating among South 
Koreans, a fear of war and an atmosphere for opposing hard-line 
sanctions against the North. In recent months, North Korean 
authorities have made tough-line remarks such as: "We will 
regard UN economic sanctions as a declaration of war,"; or 
"sanctions are a war, a war is merciless"; or "when a war breaks 
out, South Korea will be devastated by smashing attacks." 
  Some officials have also pointed out that a war on the 
Korean 
Peninsula is likely to break out with a preemptive strike 
against North Korea by the U.S. rather than by North Korea's 
reckless provocations. The so-called preventive war theory has 
been regarded as one of U.S. Government's options since U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry made the following remarks in 
April: "If North Korea should continue nuclear development, we 
are ready to conduct a bombing raid on its nuclear facilities." 
  In dealing with North Korea's nuclear issue, the United 
States's position is to maintain control over nuclear 
development even if it entails having to go to war, while the 
ROK is of the opinion that a war on the Korean Peninsula should 
be prevented by any means. This is an important difference 
between the two countries. We also cannot rule out the 
possibility of a conflict in the national interests of friendly 
nations at a decisive moment.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- Eighty-five percent of 
South Koreans believe the 1950-53 Korean war resulted from a 
North Korean attack and 53 percent see the possibility of 
another Northern invasion, according to a Gallup poll released 
Monday. 
  Gallup conducted the survey May 29 at the request of the 
Information Ministry. A total of 1,000 people above 20 years of 
age were queried over the telephone on "public consciousness of 
national security." 
  The poll revealed that 85.1 percent of the respondents felt 
North Korea triggered the Korean war while a mere 0.8 believed 
the reverse. The remaining 14.1 percent replied that they 
didn't know. 
  Asked their opinion on national unification, 31.4 percent 
responded that it should be accomplished at any cost, 
representing a diminished rate in absolute public support for 
national reunification. 
  Meanwhile, 38.5 percent supported the present state of 
peaceful co-existence while 26.3 percent replied that "if 
unified, it's good but if circumstances do not permit, there is 
no need to realize it unnecessarily." Just 3.8 percent favored 
the present status quo "as unification would bring about a great 
deal of confusion." 
  With regard to paying for unification, 49.8 percent of the 
pollees cited inter-Korean economic relations and Southern 
assistance for the North in opening its economy. Another 29.6 
opted for public donations.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Kwak No-pil] </F>
  [Text] Business circles have begun a review of the 
long-term prospect for "the situation after the summit talks," 
while expressing their welcome to the possibility that the idea 
of imposing economic sanctions against the North has gone far 
away because of the movements to push for the South-North summit 
talks. 
  This notwithstanding, while viewing that it is difficult to 
find a breakthrough in South-North economic cooperation for the 
time being, the business circles seem to take a wait-and-see 
attitude for the present as before. This is because of the 
prevailing view that a hasty reaction is a taboo under the 
circumstances in which a change might occur in the South-North 
Korean relations at any time as have been thus far. 
  But, on the basis of their judgment that nothing will go 
amiss in conducting the trade based on the 
processing-on-commission or an indirect trade through third 
countries with North Korea, which have been planned to be 
realized this year, the business circles have decided to study 
again their plan to conduct trade with North Korea, which they 
have decided to put into action for the time being. In 
particular, Lucky Goldstar, Samsung, and Daewoo Groups, which 
have been more active than any other enterprise in the 
South-North economic cooperation, have already begun studying 
the possibility of investing in North Korea after the summit 
talks are realized, while viewing that there is a higher 
possibility than ever before that the South-North summit talks 
will be realized. 
  Lucky Goldstar Group, which has engaged in more trade with 
North Korea than any other business group in the country, has 
decided to resume its trade based on the 
processing-on-commission with North Korea at an early date, 
which it has so far held back. The group will push for trade 
based on the processing on commission worth $3.5 million, as it 
already planned at the beginning of the year. It will ship raw 
and subsidiary materials worth $200,000, for whose permission it 
applied to the government on 11 June. 
  Chang Kyong-hwan, manager of the North Korea Team of Lucky 
Goldstar Corporation stated: "While its wage level is very low, 
North Korea's level of sewing and simple assembling technique is 
considerably high. The trade based on the 
processing-on-commission is very profitable from the viewpoint 
of an enterprise." 
  Samsung Group has taken a big interest in investing in North 
Korea's social overhead capital-related facilities, such as 
repairing and expanding of the facilities at Chongjin Port. The 
group is going to indirectly help North Korea solve the shortage 
of consumer goods by building electronics appliances, sweaters, 
and food stuff factories if circumstances permit, while actively 
utilizing this as an opportunity to advance into the North. 
  Daewoo Group has a mind to push afresh for the construction 
of the Nampo Estate--whose idea was discussed when its chairman 
Kim U-chung visited North Korea--thereby reaching an 
advantageous ground in an advance into the North ahead of any 
other business group. 
  The group is going to push for the development of a zinc 
mine-- which occupies the largest portion in the items imported 
by the businesses from North Korea--and a joint fishery project 
at the same time. 
  A project to develop Mt. Kumgang, on which an agreement was 
reached when Chong Chu-yong, honorary chairman of Hyundai Group, 
visited North Korea in 1989, has remained in the doldrums as a 
result that the South-North relations have become tense. But, 
on the basis of its judgment that in case the South-North summit 
talks come true, there is the high possibility that such a 
project will be discussed in earnest, the group has begun 
reexamining the idea of pushing for the project. Hyundai has 
been reported to prepare a foothold for its transactions with 
North Korea through small-scale investments, including the 
building of a cotton textile plant. 
  Other business groups have also begun reexamining their 
investment plans which they have delayed putting into force. 
Sunkyung Group has been interested in establishing sewing and 
fishery product processing plants; Ssangyong Group in 
establishing joint-venture footwear, and fishery product 
processing plants; Kolon Group in a dye processing works; and 
Kumho Group in building a tire plant. 
  One official concerned of the Federation of Korean 
Industries 
said: "Because the South-North economic cooperation issue has so 
far been too politically subjected to political issues, it has 
been difficult to push ahead with such projects on a consistent 
basis. The almost prevailing view of the working-level employees 
of the business groups is that it is necessary to push for 
economic cooperation--aside from political questions--so that we 
may not be outmaneuvered by Japan in terms of an advance into 
the North."

  [Text] The Chinese Consulate in Seoul yesterday announced 
its decision to abolish the so-called "express visa" for 
individual applicants from June 20. But the "express visa" 
applied for by travel agencies on behalf of their clients will 
remains intact. 
  The consulate had offered applicants two options according 
to 
the speed of processing visas. One was a "regular visa" which 
was processed in a week at a cost of 15,000 won, and the other 
is an "express visa" which was processed in just three days at a 
cost of 35,000 won. 
  More and more people who had been plagued by the delay in 
visa issuance opted for the express visas, to make sure they got 
their visas before their scheduled departures. They were 
willing to pay more than double the original fixed fee. 
  Other embassies in Seoul, including the Russian and 
Vietnamese Embassies also charge the so-called "express fees." 
  It's a war. This is what Korean applicants say of the visa 
application procedure at the Chinese Consulate in downtown Seoul. 
  Not war refugees but visa applicants are striving to obtain 
permission to enter China. 
  A travel agent, identified only as Cho, has stayed up all 
night on the stair-case outside the consulate office. It is 
still dark outside and it is still three hours before the 
consulate opens. 
  Her thick jacket doesn't match the month of June, early 
summer. But she needed the clothes to withstand the night chill. 
  Her job is to apply for Chinese entry visas on behalf of her 
clients. Individual applicants as well as Cho and other travel 
agents have waited all night long to submit visa applications, 
sitting on a concrete floor. 
  Since the government announced the liberalization of trips 
to 
China April 1, the number of Koreans who want to visit the 
country has sharply increased. And naturally the number of visa 
applicants at the Chinese Consulate has also gone up. 
  The visa application and issuance section at the consulate, 
however, operates only from 9 to 11:30 A.M. The consulate 
office is always overcrowded. 
  Even before the office opens, the long line for visa 
applications runs down to the front door of the building. The 
consulate is locate don the third floor. 
  "I came here last night. Otherwise, I could not succeed in 
getting even the chance to apply," said Yi Yong-chin, another 
travel agent, adding that he had been forced to come earlier and 
earlier. 
  A woman from Taegu in her 60s complained that the consulate 
staff never considers the inconvenience of the visa applicants. 
She voiced the hope that more visa application windows will be 
installed at the consulate. 
  "It is the second time I've tried to obtain an entry visa 
after failing to get a visa last week. It would be exhausting 
to return home without even applying for a visa again," she said. 
  Chinese Consul General Zhu Yigang, however, said at present 
the consulate has no plans to establish more application windows. 
  There are a total of six windows inside. One is for issuing 
visas; three for receiving application forms, two of which are 
normally open; and the other two for taking visa fees. 
Moreover, on one of the two application windows is posted a 
notice reading "Chinese Living in Korea and diplomats First." 
  "To deal with the flood of visa applications, I think the 
consulate should extend the current hours for application into 
the afternoon," said Son Nam-kyu, a businessman living in 
Kwangmyong City in Kyonggi Province. But the consul general said 
the consulate cannot extend the office hours for application any 
longer because the staff has to process more than 1,000 visas in 
the afternoon. 
  Asked about the chances of filing the visa application form 
during the day, Kim Chin-myong, who was the 20th in the waiting 
line, was a little skeptical. 
  "Yesterday, I failed to make it though I was sixth," said 
the 
frustrated man, pointing his finger to a pile of application 
forms of a travel agent in front of him. 
  Unfortunately, there were more than 10 agents waiting their 
turn with scores of application forms in front of Kim. But he 
can also find more than 200 people waiting behind him. 
  "I initially planned to ask for a regularly-processed visa', 
but I will apply for `a speedily-processed visa' at an 
additional fee of 20,000 won (about $25) because the issuance 
may be later than I expected," said Kim. 
  As individual applicants can hardly succeed in visa 
application, they decide to leave the visa work to travel 
agencies. 
  The agencies dispatch their employees to secure places at 
the 
front of the application line. Each client pays from 10,000 won 
to 20,000 for the service, sometimes more, plus the visa 
application fee. 
  "Because I thought the total fee for the visa application 
asked by an agency was too expensive, I came here to do it for 
myself. But I had to stay at a hotel after I failed to apply for 
it yesterday, spending much more money than the agency had 
asked. I should have entrusted the work to the agency," said an 
applicant from Pusan. 
  Some agencies are cashing in on the difficulty in applying 
for visas. It is an open secret that an applicant must pay from 
150,000 won to 300,000 won to a travel agency to get a 
one-day-processed visa at the Chinese Consulate.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The government issued a 
stern warning Monday against a move by locomotive engineers and 
subway workers to stage a nationwide strike next Monday. 
  In a joint statement by the home, justice, labor and 
transportation ministers, the government said any attempt to 
stop the country's railways and subways "cannot be pardoned." 
  If Chonkihyop [The National Council of Locomotive 
Engineers], 
a private group of locomotive engineers having no collective 
bargaining power, does not drop its strike plan, the government 
will have no choice but to take strict legal action, the joint 
statement warned. 
  The locomotive engineers' strike, if staged in spite of the 
government's announcement over the weekend of a package of 
measures to increase wages and improve working conditions for 
railway workers, would be considered an anti-social act, it said. 
  The statement came in response to the move by Hyundai and 
Daewoo workers and some "unregistered" labor unions, such as 
Chonnodae (The National Council of Union Representatives) and 
Chonnohyop (The National Council of Labor Unions) to strike in 
sympathy with the strike by locomotive engineers and subway 
workers. 
  In a related development, the Seoul subway workers union 
said 
Sunday it had dropped plans to launch a "work-to-rule struggle" 
Monday in view of the resulting inconvenience for passengers. 
  But the union warned that if its demand for a 14.5-percent 
wage rise was not accepted, it would go on strike starting at 
4:00 a.m. next Monday as announced earlier.

  [Text] Seoul, June 21 (YONHAP) -- Students belonging to 
Namchongnyon (The Federation of Student Councils in Kwangju and 
South Cholla Province) arrested in connection with violent 
demonstrations in Kwangju and Seoul over the weekend, including 
the forced stoppage of a Seoul-bound train near Kwangju, 
increased to 109 Tuesday morning, the National Police Agency 
said. 
  In addition, 57 were booked without physical detention and 
nine others underwent interrogation to determine whether they 
should be arrested or booked, a police spokesman said. 
  But the prosecution announced different figures -- 99 
students arrested, 61 booked without physical detention and 62 
under interrogation. 
  The number of arrested students is expected to rise sharply 
as the police, estimating those involved in the forced train 
stoppage at 500 to 550, have decided to arrest all of them. 
  Of the 109 arrested students, all but two belong to 
Namchongnyon, the spokesman said. 
  He added that in the future Namchongnyon-led demonstrations 
would not be be permitted unless peace was guaranteed, as the 
violent protests over the weekend were led by the organization. 
  In a related development, the police are interrogating 270 
farmers and students about their roles in demonstrations 
opposing National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay Round 
agreement in Yoido and Yongdungpo Monday. 
  Those found to have resorted to violence, such as wielding 
steel pipes against train workers to occupy railways, during the 
demonstrations will be arrested, he said.

  [Text] The sudden visit to China by Choe Kwang, chief of 
the General Staff of the North Korean Army, on 6 June, when the 
international community's moves for sanctions against North 
Korea were in full swing, undoubtedly prompted a lot of 
attention at home and abroad. Of course, the focus of the 
attention was directed to his meetings with high-ranking Chinese 
leaders, including Jiang Zemin. However, we also focused our 
attention on the fact that he is 76 years old. 
  If he were in our country, he would be at the age of taking 
care of his grandchildren at home. However, he is still playing 
a most important role in the North Korean society. What is more 
unique is that most of the members of the supreme leadership of 
the North Korean Army are in their seventies and over. 
  In April 1992, North Korea took the large-scale personnel 
action of promoting 664 general officers on the occasion of the 
60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army. This 
personnel action was aimed at strengthening the control of Kim 
Chong-il, who assumed the post of supreme commander of the 
People's Army in 1991, as well as at promoting general officers' 
morale. At that time, Vice Marshal O Chin-u, minister of the 
Ministry of People's Armed Forces, was promoted to marshal; and 
eight officers, including Paek Hak-nim, minister of the Ministry 
of Public Security, was promoted from general to vice marshal. 
  These officers are core figures in the People's Army, and 
all 
of them are over 70 years and some are almost 80. 
  This is because the only organization that Kim Il-song can 
trust is the North Korean military establishment, and again the 
class that he can trust in the North Korean military 
establishment is none other than the anti-Japanese guerrilla 
faction. There is no age retirement system or grade retirement 
system in the North Korean Army. Accordingly, they can stay in 
these high positions until they die. 
  Let us examine the biographies of North Korean military 
leaders. 
  O Chin-u, 77, is from Pukchong, North Hamgyong Province. He 
moved to Jiandao, Manchuria with his parents and spent his 
childhood there. He is known to have participated in 
anti-Japanese guerrilla activities under Kim Il-song in 1933. He 
participated in the 25 June Korean war as commander of a 
guerrilla unit. After the war, he served as commander of a 
People's Army corps and, later, as commander of the Air Force. 
In 1961 he became member of the Central Committee of the Workers 
Party and ranked 24th in the committee. 
  His emergence in a core position of power was possible 
because he played a leading role in the two purges staged to 
establish Kim Il-song's unitary system. He was in the lead when 
Kim Il-song purged his political rivals Yi Hyo-sun and Pak 
Kum-chol in March 1967. In recognition of his merits in the 
purges, he was promoted to director of the General Political 
Bureau of the People's Army. 
  In 1969, he also played a leading role in purging some 
high-ranking general officers such as the then National Defense 
Minister Kim Chang-pong and the then anti-South Korean 
operations director Ho Pong-hak. Thus, he gained Kim Il-song's 
absolute confidence. Since 1976, he has assumed the post of 
minister of the People's Armed Forces. Afterward, he made great 
contributions to building the foundation for Kim Chong-il's 
hereditary power. 
  In particular, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of 
the 
founding of the Workers Party in 1975, he published the treatise 
"Our Party Is a Revolutionary Party Led by the Great Chuche 
Idea." Through this treatise, he was actively involved in 
building the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il system. As a result of 
this treatise, it has become a usual practice for general 
officers to publish a treatise pledging loyalty on the occasion 
of the party founding anniversary day and the People's Army 
founding anniversary day. 
  In a nutshell, he ranks third in the order of power and is 
"the incarnation of Kim Il-song and the guardian of Kim 
Chong-il." 
  Choe Kwang is the figure who has traversed the roads of 
life's vicissitudes by being relegated from the post of chief 
of General Staff of the Army to a mine worker and returning to 
the post of chief of the General Staff of the Army again. He was 
born in Huchang, North Hamgyong Province and traversed a path of 
life similar to that of O Chin-u. 
  After he moved to Manchuria with his parents, Choe Kwang 
participated in anti-Japanese guerrilla activities with Kim 
Il-song in 1935. He participated in the Korean war as the 
commander of a division. After the Korean war, his promotion was 
faster than O Chin-u's; he became vice minister of the then 
National Defense Ministry in 1962 and chief of the General Staff 
of the People's Army in 1963. 
  In 1969, however, he was demoted to a mine worker for his 
sympathy with an "antiparty plot" involving Choe Chang-pong. 
  When he worked as a mine worker, Choe Kwang worked hard in 
tunneling work. He wrote a letter of self-criticism everyday and 
sent it to the party. Thus he showed repentance. Such an 
attitude was reported to Kim Il-song, and he was reinstated in 
1977. Afterward, he became chairman of the South Hwanghae 
Provincial People's Committee and, later, candidate member of 
the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee. In 1988, he 
returned to the post of chief of the General Staff of the North 
Korean People's Army. Since then he has firmly held the post of 
regular member of the Political Bureau until now. 
  Paek Hak-nim, 76, is a politically-oriented military man who 
is enjoying the absolute confidence of Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il. He is from Pungsan, North Hamgyong Province. He 
participated in the anti-Japanese guerrilla activities. After 
the country was liberated from the Japanese domination, he came 
to Pyongyang as the commander of a company in the security guard 
unit for Kim Il-song. He participated in the Korean war as the 
commander of a regiment. He served as commander of a corps and 
member of the Military Armistice Commission. From 1961 to 1969 
he served as Kim Il-song's senior aide and as commander of Kim 
Il-song's security guard unit. 
  After serving as vice minister of the People's Armed Forces, 
he has served as minister of the Ministry of Public Security 
since 1986. 
  He is known to have looked after Kim Il-song at the houses 
of 
O Chin-u and Kim Il after Kim Chong-suk, his wife and Kim 
Chong-il's mother, died. It is known that when Kim Chong-il was 
a university student and a primary-level party cadre Paek 
Hak-nim looked after Kim Chong-il so that he could grow up to 
become the "successor." As a result of this, it is known that he 
has maintained very sincere and friendly relations with Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The background of Yi Ul-sol and Chu To-il, members of the 
Military Commission of the party Central Committee, is similar 
to that of Paek Hak-nim in term of their careers during the 
period from the days of their anti-Japanese guerrilla activities 
up to the fifties. Afterward, however, they grew up to be combat 
unit commanders. 
  Yi Ul-sol, 74, is from Musan, North Hamgyong Province. He 
served as commander of a company in Kim Il-song's security guard 
unit and as commander of the public security officers training 
unit. He was commander of a regiment during the Korean war. 
Later, he served as commander of the 15th division. He studied 
at the Soviet Military Academy. Afterward, he held important 
posts in the Army such as the commander of the Fifth Corps, 
commander of the First Army, and first deputy chief of the 
General Staff of the People's Army. 
  He attracted Kim Il-song's attention for the first time in 
January 1969, when he dealt with the Kim Chang-pong incident. At 
that time, he played a leading role in arresting Kim Chang-pong 
and Ho Pong-hak and personally interrogated them. Thus, he 
played a leading role in purging high-ranking Army officers who 
were under the influence of Kim Chang-pong and Ho Pong-hak. 
  In 1978, he played a leading role in purging Yi Yong-mu, 
director of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army; 
and Chang Chong-hang, vice minister of the People's Armed 
Forces; who were reportedly opposed to Kim Chong-il's succession 
to power. 
  Chu To-il, 78, is known as a figure who played a leading 
role 
in modernizing the North Korean People's Army and, in 
particular, as a top expert in the light infantry sector. He is 
from Wangqing, Manchuria. His military career and the role he 
played in purging those opposing Kim Chong-il's succession to 
power were not inferior to that of Yi Ul-sol. He is now 
commander of the Pyongyang Defense Command. 
  Vice Marshal Kim Kwang-chin, vice minister of the People's 
Armed Forces, was a member of the North Korean delegation to 
North-South high-level talks and is well known to us. He studied 
at a high school in the Soviet Union and a Soviet Army artillery 
school. He participated in World War II as a Soviet Army 
artillery officer. He participated in the Korean war as deputy 
commander of a division of the People's Army. He is known to 
have advanced to Taegu during the Korean war. His age is known 
to be 76 (born in 1918). However, when he came to Seoul as a 
member of the North Korean delegation he reportedly told our 
side's delegate: "I am not that old." 
  The career of Vice Marshal Kim Pong-yul, 77, is very similar 
to that of Kim Kwang-chin. He was born in Sinuiju and studied at 
Leningrad University. He came to Pyongyang in 1945 with the rank 
of Soviet Army master sergeant. He served as deputy commandant 
of the Kaechon public security officers school. He participated 
in the Korean war as artillery commander at the Supreme 
Headquarters of the People's Army. He also served as vice 
minister of the National Defense Ministry [predecessor of the 
Ministry of People's Armed Forces]. He is now vice minister of 
the People's Armed Forces and concurrently member of the 
National Defense Commission of the party Central Committee. 
  Yi Tu-ik, member of the National Defense Commission of the 
party and military theorist, was born in Manchuria and graduated 
from the public security officers school in Manchuria. He is 73 
years old. He is known to have contributed to the publication of 
many articles calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from 
South Korea. He served as commander of the Ninth Division and as 
director of a bureau at the National Defense Ministry. Since 
1980, he has assumed the post of member of the Military 
Commission of the party Central committee. 
  Choe In-tok, president of Kim Il-song Military University is 
also a military theorist like Yi Tu-ik. He is 78 years old. He 
is from Kangwon Province. He served as commander of the Hamhung 
District Corps of the People's Army. He was elected member of 
the party Central Committee in 1980. 
  Besides these North Korean general officers mentioned above, 
there are many general officers in their seventies and older in 
the North Korean Army. 
  General Kim Chol-man (member of the National Defense 
Committee) who is known to have mapped out North Korea's four 
major military lines, is 76 years old. General Cho Myong-nok, 
commander of the Air Force of the People's Army, is 70 years 
old. General Cho Myong-sin, who is commandant of Kanggon 
Military Academy, is 78 years old.

<F P=106> [Report by KBS General Bureau in Taejon] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 22 June, the Army held a 
conference of major commanders--such as commanders at the corps 
and above level, and commanders of the Army units under the 
direct control of Army Headquarters--at the Army Headquarters in 
Kyeryongdae under the chairmanship of Kim Tong-chin, Army chief 
of staff. They confirmed their resolve to secure a complete 
military preparedness in connection with the recent North Korean 
military movements. 
  The Army analyzed: North Korea is in a status in which it 
can 
launch a provocation at any time, while maintaining the highest- 
level combat readiness by having recently deployed to the front 
area long-range guns, including 170-mm self-propelled guns, and 
waged large-scale military exercises. 
  On the analysis of this, while looking squarely at the 
reality concerning national security, the Army decided to secure 
military preparedness, achieve reform of consciousness, and push 
for the tasks of developing the Army during the latter of half 
of this year.

  [Editorial Report] The 20 May Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO on page 
2 reported that a meeting was held on 9 May between the Ministry 
of National Defense (MND) and the ruling party's Special 
Committee for Promoting National Competitiveness. At the 
meeting, the ministry revealed several plans that it is ready to 
implement to support a nationwide effort to raise the country's 
"competitive edge." One of the MND plans is to open a military 
technical college. The ministry believes the school will not 
only teach soldiers the skills needed to "manage and maintain" 
highly technical military equipment and weapons, but also 
provide future technicians for the country, since all graduates 
of the school will be fully licensed. The ministry hopes that 
the school, which will be open to all soldiers who pass a basic 
test, will be an added incentive for re-enlistment. The 
ministry intends to finalize its plans for the school by 
November, by which time it hopes to have obtained approximately 
50 billion won for the school. 
  Another of the ministry's plans involves issuing 
technicians' 
licenses to ex-military personnel. Under the plan, anyone who 
acquired technical skills while in the military will be exempted 
from taking all or a portion of the required national 
technicians' tests. Currently, there are 194 technical fields 
requiring licenses. The ministry plans to come up with 
additional fields, such as aerial photography, fire prevention 
equipment installation, auto works, etc.

  [Text] Corporate and individual PC users here will have 
easier access to a vast library of high-quality information 
possessed by renowned foreign research institutes as Korea 
Telecom (KT) launched a commercial Internet service in Seoul 
yesterday. 
  Internet is the world's largest academic computer 
communications network linking 63,000 host computers and LANs in 
60 countries. 
  More than 2 million PCs are connected with each other 
through 
Internet and about 10 million subscribers are currently using 
the service all over the world. 
  The new service, dubbed Kornet, is expected to provide 
Korea's ordinary PC users with up-to-the minute information in 
such fields as economics, culture, science and technology, by 
way of E-mail, remote login, or file transfer, a KT spokesman 
said. 
  The remote login service, for example, will enable Internet 
subscribers in Seoul to freely operate super computers in the 
United States. 
  "High-class information made public by world-class think 
tanks such as NASA, Bell Laboratories, MIT, FDA, and Harvard and 
Stanford Universities will be conveniently available to PCs at 
home and offices here," he said. 
  The Kornet service will most certainly provide a turning 
point in the upgrading of the nation's economic and 
technological bases and form an important part of the proposed 
information super-highway project, he noted. 
  So far, the Internet service has been offered to only a 
small 
number of state-run research centers. 
  Critics, however, say that Kornet's service charges ranging 
from 25,000 won to 5.2 million won per month are "too expensive." 
  They also fear that a flood of "unhealthy" information would 
be indiscriminately imported from abroad. 
  KT plans to expand the Kornet service by the end of this 
year 
to cover Pusan, Taegu and other large cities, the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, the state-funded telecom giant yesterday began to 
offer a new DB (data base) service to help parents locate their 
missing children through its PC communications network, Hitel. 
  "Parents whose children are missing can send their 
children's 
picture, age and address to Hitel and simultaneously check the 
network's list of lost children through PCs. 
  A KT official said Hitel has been linked with police 
computer 
networks and a children's foundation responsible for taking care 
of lost children, adding that information on a total of 8,000 
missing children is currently available.

  [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Securities 
Dealers Association said Monday it would be favorably disposed 
if three unlisted Hyundai Group companies reapplied for 
registration on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, a signal that 
the government has begun lifting financial restrictions on the 
group. 
  The three firms -- Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai 
Elevator 
and Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development -- will submit 
their reapplications by Monday at the earliest, Hyundai 
officials said. 
  The three applied for OTC market registration in March 1992 
and again in October 1993 but were turned down each time. They 
have not reapplied since, the association said. 
  The Hyundai Group has had "uncomfortable relations" with the 
government and been subjected to financial restrictions in 
connection with honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong's run in the 
1992 presidential election. 
  If the lifting of financial restrictions is confirmed, 
Hyundai will also apply for long-term loans from the Korea 
Development Bank, for floating foreign exchange-denominated 
securities overseas, and for listing of two unlisted firms -- 
Hyundai Merchant Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development -- on 
the stock exchange to reactivate its investment plan for this 
year, an official said. 
  Because of the trouble it has faced raising funds, Hyundai 
has had to kill or put off some projects envisaged under the 
investment plan scaled at 4.5 trillion won (5.6 billion U.S. 
dollars) for 1994. 
  Among the projects scrapped or deferred were construction of 
two new automobile factories by Hyundai Motor, completion of a 
new 16-M DRAM assembly line by Hyundai Electronics, and 
construction of a 1.5-million-ton-class dock and facilities 
producing 3,000-megawatt-class generators and turbines by 
Hyundai Heavy Industries.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata 
said Wednesday he has asked monetary authorities to take 
positive steps to stem the yen's appreciation against the 
dollar, including coordinated intervention with other countries. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hata told a news 
conference the economic community was shocked by the yen's sharp 
rise, which will cause a serious psychological impact on the 
domestic economy. 
  Citing discussions with representatives of the Japanese 
automobile industry earlier in the day, Hata said a rise of 1.00 
yen against the dollar will lead to a 10 percent drop in 
earnings by automakers. 
  During the meeting, the industry leaders urged the 
government 
to make a maximum effort to stem the yen's appreciation. 
  Hata said Japan's huge current account surplus is seen in 
the 
United States to be responsible for the higher yen. 
  He stressed the need for Japan and the U.S. to reach 
agreement on a new framework for bilateral trade as quickly as 
possible.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
on Wednesday [22 June] kicked off two days of subcabinet-level 
"framework" trade talks on government procurement in what a 
Japanese official termed "a good and constructive atmosphere." 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Deputy U.S. 
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky discussed various 
topics in the government procurement category, including the 
sensitive issue of using "quantitative criteria" to gauge the 
openness of Japan's market, a Foreign Ministry official told 
reporters. 
  The official did not go into detail, except to say, "mutual 
understanding has been deepened." 
  Wednesday's meeting was largely devoted to reviewing lower 
working-level talks that ended Tuesday, the official said. 
  Japan understands the spirit of a U.S. agreement to restart 
the long-suspended framework talks is "still alive." The U.S. 
pledged in the May agreement to refrain from seeking "numerical 
targets" to assess the Japanese market. 
  The government procurement talks comprise medical equipment 
and telecommunications equipment.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold subcabinet-level talks for two days from Wednesday on 
two areas of trade connected with government procurement, a 
Japanese official said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  A planned meeting here between Japanese Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and U.S. Deputy Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky will take up issues that have not been 
covered in recent working-level procurement trade talks, the 
official at the Foreign Ministry told reporters. 
  "Quantitative criteria" as a tool to assess Japan's 
government procurement market is among the remaining issues put 
on hold until the coming high-level talks, the official said. 
  The official was briefing reporters on Tuesday's 
working-level meeting on medical equipment trade. 
  Trade in medical equipment, covered in the discussions on 
government procurement along with telecom trade, is one of the 
three priority fields under the bilateral trade "framework" 
negotiations launched in July last year. 
  Working-level talks on telecom trade were held in Tokyo last 
Friday, with the most sensitive issue of how to set 
"quantitative criteria" also held over for the coming high-level 
meeting. 
  The working-level medical equipment talks, shortened to a 
one-day session from the originally scheduled two-day meeting, 
were held in "a good admosphere," the official said. 
  Tuesday's talks were devoted to explaining Japanese-proposed 
steps contained in a March market-opening package as a way to 
enhance foreign access to Japan's medical equipment market, 
according to the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
are likely to postpone concluding until September automobile and 
parts talks, one of three priority areas in bilateral 
"framework" trade negotiations, Japanese Government sources said 
Wednesday. 
  The two countries, however, are likely to agree on Japanese 
Government procurement and insurance industry reforms by the 
time Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and President Bill Clinton meet 
in Naples, they said. 
  The two state leaders are scheduled to meet in Naples for 
the 
annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading 
industrial nations which is to be held July 8-10. 
  "Japan wants to make further efforts and create a better 
atmosphere by then to make the U.S. side feel hopeful in 
concluding the automotive negotiations in September," the 
sources said. 
  As for Japan's macroeconomic policies, another focal point 
in 
the series of talks to create a new framework for bilateral 
trade, the sources said negotiations look likely to take more 
time. 
  They added, however, Japan will accelerate its efforts to 
bring in line domestic opinions on such macroeconomic aspects as 
tax reforms and increasing public works investment, with one 
source saying Hata needs to show Japan's basic plan to Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold a second round of negotiations on financial services 
under the "framework" trade talks in Washington next week, a 
Japanese official said Wednesday. 
  Working-level negotiators are expected to meet on financial 
services as they are scheduled to meet again for insurance 
talks, the Finance Ministry official told reporters on condition 
of anonymity. Financial service talks kicked off in Paris 
earlier this month. 
  The U.S. is urging Japan to allow investment advisory firms 
to enter the Japanese pension market and to ease regulations on 
the securities business. 
  The official said, "It's still not a matter of making 
progress" as the talks have just started.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The United States has 
presented a compromise proposal designed to replace 
state-by-state insurance licensing criteria with interstate 
ones, Finance Ministry officials said Wednesday [22 June]. 
  The U.S. proposal came in the latest round of bilateral 
talks 
on insurance that began in Tokyo Tuesday for a two-day run as 
part of the so-called trade "framework" talks, the officials 
said. 
  In the talks, Tokyo urged Washington to standardize U.S. 
criteria on giving insurance licenses, describing the current 
state-by-state criteria as a barrier for foreign insurers 
looking to do business in the U.S. 
  U.S. negotiators involved in the insurance talks told their 
Japanese counterparts that the federal government will encourage 
each state to adopt common standards on whether to issue an 
insurance license, the Japanese officials said. 
  Japan and the U.S. are to hold the next round of bilateral 
talks on insurance next week in Washington to try to reach an 
agreement before the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrialized nations in the Italian city of Naples. 
  Insurance is one of the areas to which the U.S. gives top 
priority under the framework talks, which are intended to 
rectify the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
remained far apart on the "framework" insurance talks, and big 
compromises are needed to reach an accord before the Group of 
Seven (G-7) summit in Naples in July, a Japanese official said 
Wednesday [22 June]. 
  The chances of an agreement before the summit are "50-50," 
the Finance Ministry official said when briefing reporters on 
the two- day talks that started Tuesday. 
  The working-level talks which he described as an 
agreement-drafting session will continue until midnight, and 
both sides are to meet again in Washington next week, the 
official said. 
  "We won't reach agreement today," he said, noting that the 
two sides remain "far apart" especially on objective criteria, 
Japan's "keiretsu" mutual stockholding business relations and 
the "third sector." 
  Insurance business is one of the three priority areas under 
the bilateral talks to create a new trade framework, along with 
automobile and auto parts, and Japanese Government procurement 
of telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  "Both sides must compromise," the official said, dismissing 
any intention on Japan's part of yielding unilaterally in 
seeking agreement in the insurance field before the summit. 
  On objective criteria, both sides presented their proposals 
which were at "the opposite ends" of the definition agreed upon 
in May to restart the stalled framework talks, the official said. 
  The May agreement was to adopt both quantitative and 
qualitative yardsticks for each of the negotiation sectors 
instead of imposing overall numerical targets. 
  Regarding the issue of the third sector that combines the 
benefits of both nonlife and casualty insurance businesses, 
Japan is rejecting U.S. demands for postponement by five years 
of Tokyo's lifting of a market ban. 
  Japan currently allows only foreign-affiliated insurers to 
sell third-sector policies but is considering lifting the ban on 
Japanese insurers in two years under a law revision scheduled 
for submission to the Diet next year for the first time in five 
decades. 
  The third sector is expected to remain on the table "until 
the last moment" of an overall accord on the insurance business, 
the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japanese automakers 
purchased 15.53 billion dollars worth of U.S. auto parts in 
fiscal 1993, up 14.1 percent from the year before, the Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  The figure totals such purchases by local units of Japanese 
automakers operating in the United States and imports by their 
parent companies at home, said Tatsuro Toyoda, head of the 
association. 
  Toyoda, also president of Toyota Motor Corp., expressed 
concern, however, that such purchases have not been increasing 
enough to reach the earlier targeted amount of 19 billion 
dollars by the end of the current fiscal year through next March 
31. 
  "I hope each automaker will make further efforts so we can 
accomplish the target," Toyoda said at a meeting with the press. 
  In fiscal 1993 which ended on March 31, local units of 
Japanese carmakers bought about 12.9 billion dollars worth of 
U.S. auto parts, up 15.7 percent from the year before. 
  Purchases by their parent companies amounted to 2.6 billion 
dollars, up 6.8 percent. Parent firms were less active in 
buying because of sluggish sales in the recession-hit domestic 
market. 
  The year-on-year 14.1 percent increase in the total figure 
compared with a 29.4 percent rise in the previous year. 
  The association said that as long as domestic sales remain 
slack it will be hard for Japanese automakers to reach the 
target this year. 
  The United States has suggested making annual purchase 
targets for American-made car parts by Japanese automakers for 
fiscal 1995 to 1997 one of the "objective criteria" for the 
bilateral trade "framework" talks. 
  The two countries are discussing what kinds of criteria are 
suitable for evaluating Japan's efforts to open its market for 
foreign products and services. 
  Industry sources see the slow increase in car parts 
purchases 
by Japanese automakers this business year as possibly affecting 
the talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The United States on 
Tuesday [21 June] issued a statement welcoming Japan's current 
efforts toward economic deregulation. 
  The statement, issued by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, said the 
U.S. welcomes the ongoing government review of the laws and 
regulations governing the Japanese economy. 
  It expressed hope that the review "will result in 
elimination 
of the wide range of unnecessarily restrictive regulations and 
administrative procedures which burden and restrain the Japanese 
economy." 
  In the past bilateral "framework" trade talks, the U.S. 
presented Japan with specific reform proposals in the area of 
deregulation, competition policy, administrative procedures and 
distribution, the statement said. 
  It said the U.S. hopes these proposals will be incorporated 
in the upcoming Japanese deregulation package.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Wednesday that the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. dollar 
stemmed from speculative buying. 
  "The yen's appreciation is speculative," the premier told 
reporters in the Diet building and predicted the speculative 
mood will not last long. 
  Hata called an emergency meeting of key cabinet ministers at 
noon on Tuesday to exchange views on the Japanese currency's 
surge. 
  Attending the meeting were Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Economic Planning Agency 
Director General Yoshio Terasawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai. 
  "I think it's important for the cabinet to grasp the 
situation properly," Kumagai told a news conference. 
  The top government spokesman said the government should take 
necessary measures to spur domestic demand and boost the 
nation's sluggish economy so as to stem the yen's rise against 
the dollar. 
  The dollar opened at a postwar low of 100.35 yen in Tokyo on 
Wednesday, down 1.80 yen from Tuesday's closing rate of 102.15 
yen. 
  The dollar's opening plunge against the yen followed its 
overnight nosedive in New York, where the currency temporarily 
hit a postwar low of 99.85-95 yen on reports of a widened U.S. 
trade deficit for April. 
  The dollar's previous global low was 100.40 yen recorded in 
Tokyo on Aug. 17, 1993. 
  The U.S. currency ended New York trading at 100.10-20 yen, 
regaining the 100 yen level on technical buying amid fears of 
central bank intervention.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Key cabinet members will 
meet at noon Wednesday [22 June] to discuss the yen's surge 
against the dollar and its possible dampening effects on the 
just-emerging recovery of the Japanese economy, government 
officials said. 
  The yen soared to a new global postwar low of 99.85-95 yen 
in 
New York at one point Tuesday before finishing at 100.10-20 yen. 
  The emergency cabinet meeting will discuss primarily the 
need 
to keep in close contact with other industrialized countries and 
jointly intervene in the currency markets to arrest the yen's 
ascent, the officials said . 
  In addition, the meeting will reconfirm that no time should 
be lost in drafting a tax reforms program and other 
macroeconomic policies and deregulatory steps, they said. 
  The noon meeting will bring together Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai, and Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency (EPA).

  Hata and his top aides agreed that the yen's movement has a 
strong impact on the just-emerging recovery of Japan's economy, 
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura told reporters. 
  Hata convened the emergency cabinet meeting following the 
yen's overnight surge in New York to a new global postwar record 
high of 99.85-95 yen against the dollar. 
  At the gathering, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii voiced 
concern about the yen's violent fluctuations and spoke of the 
need for Japan to keep in close touch with other G-7 nations to 
stabilize the currency markets, Kitamura said. 
  The dollar ended Wednesday morning in Tokyo at 101.15 yen, 
down 1.00 yen from Tuesday, after opening at a postwar record 
low in Tokyo of 100.35 yen. 
  Attending Wednesday's meeting were Hata, Fujii, 
International 
Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio 
Terasawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan will take 
"appropriate and timely" measures to stem any excessive rise of 
the yen that could put a damper on the recovering economy, 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  "As I have repeatedly said, we are in close contact (with 
other Group of Seven nations) to take appropriate and timely 
measures," Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet 
meeting. 
  Referring to the yen's rise to the 101 yen level against the 
dollar Monday in overseas markets, Fujii quoted market 
participants as saying the move stemmed from the German mark's 
strengthening. 
  Asked about the impact of the yen's rise on Japan's economy, 
Fujii said, "As Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and I have 
been saying at the Diet, the economy is moving toward a 
recovery, but the yen's rise is worrisome." 
  Concerning falling stock and bond prices, Fujii said he 
wants 
to "watch for a while" and that he should refrain from 
commenting on day-by-day movements.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Wednesday he contacted other G-7 major nations when 
the dollar plunged overnight in New York, but refused to comment 
on why noticeable joint actions like in May were not taken. 
  "We were and are in close contact (with other Group of Seven 
major nations)," Fujii told a press meeting in reference to the 
dollar's temporary fall below 100 yen for the first time in the 
postwar period. 
  Asked why G-7 nations did not move jointly to defend the 
fall 
below that level, as was done in May, Fujii said he could not 
comment on details of the talks, and simply stressed that the 
G-7 accord to stem excessive currency volatility remains 
unchanged. 
  When the dollar plunged in May, nearing the 100 yen level, 
G-7 nations stepped jointly into the markets, and in an unusual 
move U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement 
confirming the concerted intervention. 
  Fujii declined to comment on whether G-7 nations should 
renew 
the message, and noted, "let me just say that we are in close 
contact." 
  As for Japan, the finance minister said he will take "firm 
actions" to stem the yen's rise, toning up his comments from 
"appropriate and timely measures." 
  Describing the currency movements as "speculative and 
rapid," 
he said, "it is bad not only for that nation but also for the 
world economy." 
  Fujii also reiterated that the yen's rise is the major 
concern along with labor conditions for the Japanese economy, 
which is moving toward a recovery. 
  Asked about monetary and fiscal policies given the yen's 
rise, Fujii said there will be no changes on the fiscal side, 
and his ministry will continue pursuing the already-launched 
measures. 
  Monetary policies are for the Bank of Japan to decide, he 
noted, refusing to comment. 
  He referred particularly to the February 15.25 trillion yen 
stimulus package, which included 5.5 trillion yen in income tax 
cuts for the current fiscal year, and the fiscal 1994 budget 
poised to pass the Diet soon after a long delay. 
  On full-fledged tax reform promised in the March 
market-opening package, Fujii repeated his call on the 
government and the ruling parties to finalize the reform bills 
by the end of the month with concrete scale and dates for 
permanent tax cuts and an offsetting consumption tax hike. 
  The government's Tax Commission and a coalition forum on 
Tuesday issued separate reports on the tax reform, with both 
leaving out concrete figures and dates for later. 
  Political uncertainties are mounting, however, with the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party set to submit a 
no-confidence motion against the minority cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, which could cause further delay in the 
tax reform process. 
  On deregulation, also promised in the March package, Fujii 
said his ministry is ready to present "appropriate" steps.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Wednesday [22 June] he will take firm action against 
the dollar's downslide while keeping close contact with other 
Group of Seven industrialized nations. 
  Fujii was asked for comment on the dollar's tumble below 100 
yen at one point for the first time in the postwar period in New 
York overnight. 
  Describing the dollar's dip below 100 yen as rapid and 
speculative, Fujii pointed out that it will have a negative 
impact not only on the Japanese economy but also on the global 
economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The Japanese auto industry 
asked the government Wednesday [22 June] to make maximum efforts 
to arrest the yen's surge against the dollar, a Trade Ministry 
official said. 
  Tatsuro Toyoda, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, made the request during a breakfast meeting with 
senior officials of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI), including MITI chief Eijiro Hata, the official 
told a press conference. 
  The auto industry has strived to reinforce its earnings 
position through globalization of business operations so as not 
to be easily affected by exchange rate swings, Toyoda was quoted 
as saying. 
  "But an excessively strong yen would put a drag on such 
efforts," he said. 
  Hata shared the auto industry's concern over the latest yen 
rise, saying the yen has appreciated against the dollar to a 
worrisome level, the official said. 
  The dollar slipped below 100 yen in overnight New York 
trading for the first time, sinking briefly to a record global 
low of 99.85 yen. 
  "An excessive strength of the yen could dampen burgeoning 
recovery in auto sales," said Toyoda, who is also president of 
Toyota Motor Corp. He said he hoped the government will take 
action to drive down the yen to "adequate levels." 
  On the trade front, the auto industry renewed its request to 
the government to hold firm to a policy of rejecting any U.S. 
proposals that would lead to introduction of "numerical 
targets," the MITI official said. 
  Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., was quoted 
as 
saying, "The United States has pledged not to seek numerical 
targets but the auto industry is concerned the issue will be 
revived during ongoing auto trade talks between the two 
countries." 
  Hata replied that Japan will seek to settle the trade talks 
with the U.S. in a manner that will not draw criticism from the 
global community, the MITI official said. 
  "Japan will say what it should say in line with the spirit 
of 
a new global trade order to be formed under the World Trade 
Organization," Hata was quoted as saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
expressed hope Wednesday that the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
[Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ)] would return to the 
ruling coalition, almost two months after the SDP left the 
coalition in protest. But Hata declined to comment on the 
timing of a top-level meeting with SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, who is under fire from rank and file members of his 
own party for his calls to the Hata cabinet to voluntarily 
resign. 
  The SDP on Tuesday unveiled a blueprint of a potential new 
coalition government as agitation increases among SDP 
legislators to rejoin the coalition, which the party quit in 
April to protest the sudden formation of a parliamentary group 
excluding the SDP. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
the largest opposition group, told reporters Wednesday morning 
he is not sure if the SDP is really serious about allying with 
the coalition once again. 
  At a high-level meeting on Wednesday morning, the LDP 
confirmed that it will submit a no-confidence motion against 
Hata's minority government. The LDP's action is expected to 
come after the passage -- possibly on Thursday -- of the fiscal 
1994 state budget, LDP sources said. But some LDP lawmakers 
have cautioned against such a step, saying a no-confidence 
motion would not pass in the 511-member lower house without the 
help of the SDP, the LDP sources said. 
  LDP officials said Kono met former foreign minister Michio 
Watanabe to seek the LDP Stalwart's support for the campaign to 
oust the Hata cabinet from power.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) formally decided Wednesday [22 June] to 
submit a no-confidence motion against the coalition government 
of Prime Minister Hata, party officials said. 
  The LDP approved submission of the motion at the party's 
decision-making Executive Council. 
  The LDP is scheduled to submit the motion immediately after 
the Diet passage of the long-overdue government-proposed budget 
for fiscal 1994. The current Diet session ends June 29. 
  The LDP's decision came amid a series of strategic talks 
held 
separately between the Social Democratic Party, which quit the 
ruling alliance in April, and coalition parties seeking to lure 
the SDP back into the fold.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's ruling coalition is headed for crucial reconciliation 
talks with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] 
which holds the key to the fate of his minority government. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said he will call on Hata, 
hopefully Wednesday [22 June], to discuss the SDP's policy 
platform, adopted late Tuesday, and the party's possible return 
to the ruling coalition. 
  The SDP, the second largest opposition party, will not 
submit 
a no-confidence vote during the course of talks, whose outcome 
should determine the survival of Hata's two-month-old cabinet, 
Murayama said. 
  Meanwhile, the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) decided the same day to formalize the party policy of 
submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after 
the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget clears the last Diet hurdle 
on Thursday. 
  With the opposition camp raising the ante through their 
political maneuvering, the ruling coalition extended its own 
overture to the SDP to rejoin their camp, officially proposing 
talks to the socialists. The coalition is pinning hopes on its 
efforts to woo the SDP back into their group in order to defeat 
the LDP's planned no-confidence vote. 
  The SDP platform has been welcomed by both the ruling 
coalition and the LDP, which is seeking to create a stopgap 
cabinet with the SDP through early elections. 
  The SDP policy outline calls for making the policy-making 
process within the coalition more "democratic" and proposes a 
tax reform centered on raising indirect taxes. The party stormed 
out of the ruling coalition in April in a row over a move by 
some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc without the 
socialists, which the SDP viewed as an attempt to put them on 
the back-seat in policy making. 
  The outline also urges passage in the next Diet session of 
the bills for redrawing the electoral map for a new election 
system of single-seat constituencies combined with proportional 
representation for the House of Representatives, to replace the 
current multi-seat system. 
  Ruling coalition lawmakers immediately showed a readiness to 
embrace the SDP proposals. "At first sight, there are no 
problems (with the platform)," said a top government official. 
  A senior official of Komeito [Clean Government Party], a key 
component of the coalition, concurred, saying, "the hurdles (for 
an agreement) are not high. The proposals show (the SDP) is 
seriously thinking about returning to the coalition." 
  The SDP's government blueprint also met a welcome from the 
LDP, which needs the socialists' support to pass the 
no-confidence vote. "The contents (of the proposals) are nothing 
that we have to refuse at the negotiating table," a senior party 
policy maker said. "No obstacles exist to our acceptance," 
another senior official said. 
  Even if the ruling coalition and the socialists agree to 
link 
up again, it remains unclear whether Hata will retain office due 
to disarray within the SDP. 
  SDP lawmakers who support Murayama called first for Hata's 
resignation, and a no-confidence motion if Hata should refuse 
the call. On the other hand, SDP right-wingers led by Wataru 
Kubo, the party's secretary general, are placing top priority on 
a return to the ruling camp and are reluctant about demanding 
that Hata step down before the results of the realliance talks 
become clear.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The opposition Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] displayed willingness 
Wednesday to mend frayed ties with the ruling coalition, from 
which it split in April, by presenting a policy outline at the 
outset of crucial realliance talks. 
  The SDP put forth its platform on forming a new government 
during separate talks with the ruling coalition, the leading 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party Sakigake 
[Harbinger]. 
  In talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority 
coalition, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo expressed strong 
interest in returning to the ruling camp, party officials said. 
"We feel responsibility for destabilizing the government," he 
said in a meeting with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] secretary general and the coalition's key strategist, and 
other coalition officials. 
  The SDP broke off from the coalition in April immediately 
following Hata's election as premier after its partners moved to 
create a new Diet bloc, excluding the SDP. The party 
interpreted the step as an effort to put it in the backseat in 
policy-making. 
  In Wednesday talks, the SDP and the coalition agreed on an 
early summit between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to 
iron out key policy differences. The main issues on the 
negotiation table are the timing of submitting bills to redraw 
electoral districts for the House of Representatives, a proposed 
consumption tax hike and the manner of policy-making within the 
coalition. The two sides will hold the second round of talks 
Thursday morning. 
  The SDP made clear its primary target is rapprochement with 
the coalition, at least for now, rather than an alliance with 
the LDP, the SDP's longstanding rival, the officials said. 
  The SDP turned down the LDP's overture for immediate talks 
to 
create a stopgap cabinet for a snap election. 
  The LDP, which formally decided the same day to submit a 
no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after the budget 
is passed, readily embraced the SDP policy blueprint and pressed 
the socialists to join hands with the party. The SDP response 
was noncommital. 
  The coalition also greeted the SDP's proposals with 
eagerness, and Ozawa expressed hope for cooperation with the SDP 
to create ''a government with a strong foundation.'' 
  The coalition also showed a compromising posture on the key 
issue of a consumption tax hike, a touchy issue for the SDP, by 
deciding in an executive meeting to delay a final decision on 
the size of the hike. 
  The coalition's solo exception to the SDP plan concerned 
bills to redraw electoral maps for the lower house in line with 
political reform bills enacted in January. 
  Ozawa called for such bills to be submitted to the current 
Diet session, which ends next Wednesday, while the SDP wants 
them submitted in the next session to avoid an extension of the 
current term. 
  The apparently smooth start of realliance talks 
notwithstanding, the fate of the two-month-old Hata cabinet 
remains unclear, political analysts said. 
  The SDP leadership is under pressure from party members who 
are leery about their leaders' readiness to return to the 
coalition, according to the analysts. 
  Kubo, a pro-coalition leader, underscored awareness of the 
skepticism by telling Sakigake [Harbinger] officials that the 
SDP still wants Hata's resignation. 
  Kubo said the SDP blueprint ''doesn't indicate acceptance of 
the current government. The role of the Hata cabinet will come 
to an end when the budget passes the Diet.'' 
  Ruling and opposition parties agreed the same day to pass 
the 
budget bills through the House of Councillors Thursday evening 
to making them law. The spotlight will then be cast on the SDP, 
which holds a key in the nation's political course. 
  Failure of the SDP-coalition talks would certainly lead to 
passage of a no-confidence vote against the Hata cabinet, 
leaving Hata with an unpalatable choice of stepping down with 
his ministers or dissolving the lower house for snap polls. 
  Even if the talks prove successful and pave the way for the 
SDP's reentry into the ruling camp, Hata may still be forced to 
leave office, bowing to a possible SDP demand, SDP sources said. 
  It is also possible that some SDP lawmakers will break ranks 
with party leadership and support the LDP plan for a 
no-confidence vote, the sources said. 
  In any course, the Hata administration will face a critical 
test of survival in the days following the expected passage of 
the long- overdue budget Thursday, political analysts said.

dissolution of the Diet and a snap general election. 
  The heads of the country's four major business lobbies 
agreed 
in a joint statement issued after their meeting that "disbanding 
of the Diet and a following snap election, which would create a 
political vacuum, should be avoided at all costs." 
  The joint statement also said the ruling coalition and the 
opposition camp should realize political reforms through 
constructive debate and that the next general election should be 
conducted under the new single-member constituency system after 
the electoral map is redrawn. 
  The Tuesday meeting brings together Shoichiro Toyoda, 
chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren), Kosaku Inaba, Chairman of the Japan Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan 
Federation of Employers Associations, and Masaru Hayami, 
chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. 
  At the meeting, Nagano, who attended a recent International 
Labor Organization (ILO) meeting, reported that the European 
economy has been showing healthier signs although a recovery has 
not yet been in sight. 
  The four business leaders agreed that the Japanese economy 
is 
at a similar stage.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday [21 June] denied allegations that 
he falsely told the Diet he repaid both principal and interest 
on a 100 million yen loan from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin 
trucking group. 
  "What I said during a news conference (on April 8) is 
identical to my answers to legislators' questions at the Diet," 
Hosokawa told a session of the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee. 
  "I came to know the fact that my office had handled interest 
on the loan from Sagawa Kyubin as political donations based on 
my political office's report to me, shortly before my April 8 
announcement of resignation as prime minister," said Hosokawa 
who testified at the committee under oath. 
  While in office, Hosokawa repeatedly told the Diet that he 
had repaid both interest and principal on the loan from the 
Sagawa Kyubin group, which was involved in the 1992 
money-and-mobster scandal that led to the downfall of one-time 
political kingpin Shin Kanemaru. 
  However, he told the April 8 news conference that his 
political office had accepted the interest on the loan as 
political donations on the basis of an agreement with Sagawa 
Kyubin that offered to give up the interest Hosokawa owed to the 
trucking group as a form of political donation. 
  Hosokawa also denied allegations that he falsely told the 
Diet that his father-in-law Shohei Ueda initiated a deal to 
obtain 300 shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) 
and he merely pledged his condominium in Tokyo as collateral to 
secure a loan to help his father-in-law buy the shares. 
  "I was negative, rather than positive, regarding a proposal 
to purchase the NTT shares, but I instructed my secretary 
(Masatoshi) Miyama to offer the condominium in (Tokyo's) 
Motoazabu area as collateral as my father-in-law asked me to 
provide collateral to help him buy the NTT shares," he said. 
  Hosokawa's sworn testimony comes as the country's two 
largest 
political parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), are preparing to submit a 
no-confidence motion against the minority government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. Both the LDP and SDP are in opposition. 
  Diet sources said both the LDP and the SDP want to secure a 
pretext that would justify their separate moves in tabling the 
no-confidence motion. 
  Hosokawa, leader of the Japan New Party, one of the 
coalition 
parties, and his coalition partners have long resisted demands 
from the opposition to appear before the Diet panel to testify 
on the allegations of his alleged financial irregularities. 
  The coalition maintained the panel's decision last Thursday 
to summon Hosokawa is invalid, noting that the committee's 
chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi of the SDP contravened a parliamentary 
practice of deciding on a summons only through consensus among 
all the parties. 
  During Thursday's committee session, legislators of the 
ruling coalition voiced opposition to the proposal to summon 
Hosokawa. But Yamaguchi declared that his committee decided to 
summon the former prime minister without dissent. 
  Earlier Tuesday, Hosokawa told a hastily arranged news 
conference that he will not appear in Tuesday's committee 
session but will testify if the ruling and opposition parties 
agree to summon him. 
  But following backstage talks, both camps later agreed to 
summon Hosokawa on condition that the committee chairman explain 
about the summons. 
  At the outset of the panel's session, Yamaguchi said, "I am 
sorry for the current situation and the committee will not make 
it a precedent" to summon a witness without securing a consensus 
from committee members. 
  The ruling coalition's refusal to allow Hosokawa to testify 
over the 1982 loan from Sagawa and the 1986 purchase of NTT 
shares has stalled Diet debate on the long-overdue fiscal 1994 
state budget, whose quick passage has been deemed necessary to 
provide fiscal stimulus to the stagnant Japanese economy. 
  The Diet sources said the ruling coalition decided to 
withdraw its objection to the summoning of Hosokawa for fear 
that the opposition may accuse it of a cover-up over the truth 
about Hosokawa's alleged financial improprieties. 
  Such an accusation could become a pretext strong enough to 
justify a possible submission of the no-confidence motion, the 
sources said. 
  The House of Councillors is expected to pass the budget on 
Thursday. The budget has already cleared the lower house. The 
current regular Diet session is to expire on June 29. 
  Earlier in the day, LDP executives agreed to decide on 
Wednesday to submit the no-confidence motion, LDP officials said. 
  The SDP has demanded Hata and his cabinet ministers 
voluntarily resign en masse after passage of the budget to pave 
way for the formation of a new coalition government, in which 
the SDP would participate. 
  During the questioning which lasted for two hours and 45 
minutes, Hosokawa dismissed as a "misunderstanding" Diet 
testimony by investment consultant Shuzo Fujiki, who had 
interpreted the NTT share purchase as a deal initiated by 
Hosokawa himself and not by Hosokawa's father-in-law. 
  Fujiki said he helped Hosokawa acquire a huge loan to 
finance 
the purchase of the 300 NTT shares by introducing a Tokyo-based 
stock investment financing company ready to extend the huge loan 
in view of Hosokawa's creditworthiness as then Kumamoto governor. 
  Hosokawa also testified that he has already settled another 
controversy over his acknowledged failure to declare to tax 
authorities an income accruing from investment of his personal 
assets worth 57 million yen. 
  He said the problem has been alleviated as he submitted to 
the authorities a revised tax return that carries the accounts 
of the investment profits.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) will submit a report soon to the 
government to urge that a budget for space exploration be 
incorporated in a public works spending program currently being 
worked out, Keidanren officials said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  The top Japanese business lobby has prepared the report for 
presentation to the Finance Ministry, the Science and Technology 
Agency and other government departments, the officials said. 
  The government should increase its annual space budget 
2.5-fold to 500 billion yen and appropriate part of the budget 
from the public works investment program, the report says. 
  Specifically, the report calls for the development of 
spacecraft for technical tests and a satellite-based earth 
observation system under the budget. 
  It says science and technology for space exploration is 
essential for development of a wide range of industrial 
technology and useful as a bargaining chip in negotiating the 
introduction of foreign technology.

  [Text] Noshiro, Japan, June 21 KYODO -- Combustion tests 
were held Tuesday [21 June] morning for the first-stage rocket 
motor of Japan's largest solid-fuel rocket being developed to 
launch scientific satellites. 
  The tests on a prototype of M14, the first-stage rocket 
motor 
of the three-stage M5 rocket, were conducted in Noshiro, Akita 
Prefecture, in northern Japan, by the Institute of Space and 
Aeronautical Science under the Education Ministry. 
  Test results will be announced Tuesday evening, institute 
officials said. 
  The M5 is to be used for launching three Japanese scientific 
satellites, beginning in fiscal 1996.

  [Text] Noshiro, Japan, June 21 KYODO -- The first-stage 
motor of the three-stage M-5 rocket, Japan's largest solid-fuel 
rocket for launching space exploration vehicles, was 
successfully test-fired Tuesday [21 June], the Education 
Ministry said. 
  The test was conducted at the ministry's Institute of Space 
and Aeronautical Science rocket test site at Noshiro in Akita 
Prefecture on the west coast of northern Japan. 
  The M-14 motor has a diameter of 2.5 meters, a length of 
13.7 
meters, and weighs 92 tons. It can develop a thrust of up to 
382 tons. 
  The test team said the fuel used in the test matched their 
expectations and the equipment regulating the thrust operated 
normally. 
  The fuel was ignited at 11:30 A.M. under a cloudy sky with a 
strong easterly wind. About 71 tons of fuel was consumed over 
80 seconds. 
  Journalists covering the event about a kilometer away could 
hear the rumbling of the horizontally positioned motor as it 
spewed orange flame and white smoke out over the Sea of Japan. 
  Development of the M-5 began in the 1990s, but was delayed 
because it was accorded lower development priority than the 
smaller 1.8-meter-diameter solid-fuel rocket booster used in the 
National Space Development Agency's large-scale liquid-fuel 
rocket, the H-2. 
  This autumn, in-flight combustion tests of the second-stage 
motor, M-24, will be conducted, and in 1995, fuel will be tested 
in a second experimental version of the M-14 using the same 
high- tensile steel as in the actual rocket. 
  The first rocket is scheduled to carry a scientific 
satellite 
known as Muses-B from the Kagoshima Space Center in 1996.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry will set up a study group in July on 
a new framework for media industries in line with the 
prospective multimedia era, ministry officials said Wednesday 
[22 June]. 
  The study group will be comprised of experts and 
representatives from various media industries, ranging from 
newspaper, broadcasting and cable television to 
telecommunications. 
  They will examine, for instance, how those industries can 
share access to optical fiber communication networks, and 
discuss charges for their use, the officials said. 
  Rules for new participants in the multimedia services will 
also be examined, they said, adding that existing regulations on 
telecommunications and broadcasting industries should also be 
reviewed. 
  In May, an advisory committee to the posts minister 
submitted 
a report urging legal preparations for the upcoming multimedia 
era, which will inevitably reshape the media industry.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. nuclear submarines 
are reportedly extending espionage near the coast of Korea these 
days. 
  The number of calls of U.S. nuclear submarines at ports on 
the west coast of Japan last year jumped remarkably. The 
submarines called at the White Beach Base of the U.S. Navy in 
Okinawa on 17 occasions at maximum and frequent the Sasebo Base 
in Nagasaki prefecture and the Yokosuka Port. 
  The brisk activities of U.S. nuclear submarines are related 
to the expanded scope of the the U.S. naval espionage against 
the DPRK, said ITAR-TASS June 20. 
  The news agency said U.S. nuclear submarines navigating 
along 
the shores of the DPRK are specialised in collection of 
information about the communications network of the Armed Forces 
of the DPRK and every possible eavesdropping of radio 
communications. 
  U.S. nuclear submarines enter Sasebo Port of Japan but stay 
on the waters off the harbour for more than an hour, not 
anchoring at the wharf, in order to hand over information, 
experts say. 
  The activation of the espionage of U.S. nuclear submarines 
near the coast of the DPRK coincides with the intensification of 
the U.S. hostile campaign to stifle the DPRK.

  [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists 
on 21 June perpetrated aerial espionage on the northern part of 
the Republic by bringing an RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane 
from an overseas base into the sky of South Korea. 
  The reconnaissance plane that flew in from a base in 
Okinawa, 
Japan ran amok in taking aerial pictures and conducting 
electronic air reconnaissance of the Northern Republic by flying 
high on the skies above Kangnung, Yangpyong, and Tokchok Island 
between 1100 and 1600. 
  In the meantime, pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off 
and landing attack planes, and early-warning planes that took 
off from overseas bases ran madly about in a surprise bombing 
exercise in the skies above Yongyol, Pyongchang, and Asan Bay as 
operation theaters in cooperation with the flying corps of the 
U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. 
  The powder-reeking aerial war exercise, conducted under the 
command of an E-3 early-warning plane known as an aerial flying 
commander, was a reckless play with fire aimed at reviewing 
actual warfare capabilities of a coordinated strike in times of 
northward invasion between flying groups from overseas bases and 
those belonging to the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea. 
  On the same day, a formation of KC-135 refueling planes took 
off from a U.S. base in the Pacific region and was deployed at 
the U.S. Air Force base located in South Korea.

  [Text] Tehran, June 21, IRNA -- The ambassador of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) here, K. Yong Roi, 
told managing director of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Broadcasting (IRIB), 'Ali Larijani on Tuesday that the U.S. has 
private goals behind its avowed concern about nuclear 
proliferation, and that it exploits the U.N. as a platform for 
pressuring Pyongyang, and also pulls its strings in the 
International Atomic Energy Organization in order to make things 
needlessly difficult for DPRK. 
  He said DPRK is interested in talks with South Korea and 
that 
already many meetings have been held between the officials of 
the two Koreas. 
  Larijani said the Islamic Republic of Iran has valued its 
friendly relations with DPRK which, he said, is obviously 
annoying to the United States. 
  He said Iran would all the same continue to support the 
anti-imperialist position of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea.

  [Text] According to reports, unusual moves [simsangchi 
anun umjigimdul] are being made on U.S. Army bases in Japan at a 
time when the U.S. hostile policy of crushing the Republic is 
becoming all the more obvious [migugui pan konghwaguk choktaesi 
apsal chaektongi poda nogorhwa toego innun kotkkwa ttaerul kachi 
hayo]. 
  U.S. battleships frequently enter and leave port at the 
Yokosuka base, the sortie ground of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The 
flagship Blue Ridge left port on the morning of 17 June, 
following the sailing out of port by the large naval destroyer 
(Pipe). Four U.S. warships -- including the missile cruiser 
Mobile Bay, the naval destroyer O'Brien, and an oil tanker -- 
are at anchor at this base, and the aircraft carrier 
Independence that participated in the Rimpac-94 joint military 
exercise, will return there. 
  The Independence abruptly made an unplanned call at this 
base 
to be refueled on the evening of 3 June and left port on the 
following day without any accompanying ship. 
  Foreign media reported that this aircraft carrier had 
received an order from the U.S. secretary of defense to stay in 
waters, from which it can get to the Korean peninsula within a 
week. 
  The U.S. ammunition ship Mauna Kea recently made port in 
this 
base and brought a large amount of ammunition in the (Urago) 
ammunition repository for two days. 
  U.S. military planes are busy conducting exercises in the 
Iwakuni base, an air base of the U.S. Marine Corps where 38 
military planes including various attack planes and electronic 
warplanes are deployed. 
  Witnesses said that FA-18 attack planes were carrying out an 
exercise of flying toward the North, AV-8B attack planes carried 
by the amphibious assault ship Belleau Wood were conducting a 
vertical taking off and landing exercise. 
  Nuclear-powered submarines have unusually and frequently 
entered and left port at the Sasebo base in Nagasaki Prefecture 
since the beginning of the year. The number of ammunition ships 
and refueling ships entering port is also increasing. The 
number of ammunition and refueling ships that entered port in 
this base this year is 82, up 60 percent from the same period 
last year. Most of those refueling ships come from South Korea. 
  The U.S. Forces in Okinawa are carrying out exercises, under 
the simulation of sanctions and use of arms with Okinawa as the 
supposed battlefield. Troops of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed 
there are frenzied particularly in special operations training 
and exercise. 
  These busy moves in U.S. Army bases in Japan are arousing 
our 
extensive alert [kipun kyonggyesim].

  [Text] The criminal maneuver by the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppet clique to wage a war to invade the North 
under the pretext of our nuclear issue has reached an extreme 
point. The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are babbling 
about a cooperative system in the nuclear issue, and are 
generally assuming a posture of actual warfare aimed at an 
offensive attack against the North. 
  At the National Assembly's National Defense Committee 
meeting 
on 9 June, the so-called puppet defense minister proclaimed that 
the puppet army has entered into a 24-hour emergency alert 
system. The puppet clique indefinitely prolonged the measure to 
strengthen the posture of military preparedness, which was 
carried out from November of last year to late March of this 
year. As such, all of the puppet army is under an emergency 
alert preparedness day in, day out. 
  The U.S. Forces occupying South Korea have also taken the 
posture of 24-hour alert preparedness, and the reinforcements of 
the U.S. imperialist aggression forces are thoroughly prepared 
to be committed to South Korea at any time. In addition, the 
U.S. imperialist aggression forces have completed preparation 
measures for a possible war on important U.S. military bases 
including the Osan airport and facilities, and they have 
completed storage of spare ammunition and oil. Also, a hot line 
has already been installed between the U.S. defense secretary 
and the puppet defense minister and is currently in use. 
  The puppet clique is accelerating to reorganize the local 
reserve force, the puppet army's detached force, so that it can 
play the role of a professional army in preparation for wartime. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are continuing 
to 
drag in up-to-date murderous weapons and equipments into South 
Korea. In March, 18 up-to-date Apache helicopters for offensive 
use, which is a scale of one battalion, was dispatched to South 
Korea. Currently, plans are being promoted to increase it to 
three battalions. War equipments of each branch of the service 
including antitank missiles, up-to-date moving radars, and 
vessels are continuously being brought into South Korea. 
  This year, the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are 
examining to take the posture of being prepared against the 
North step by step and according to scenario. In April, U.S. 
Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea, examined 
on-the-spot the new strategy plan 5027 to attack the North, and 
gave new orders. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are all the more 
crazily carrying out military exercise aimed at a simulated war 
to invade the North. Under the instigation of the U.S. 
imperialists, the puppet clique carried out the first half of 
this year's joint strategic exercise in mid-May jointly by the 
puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force, and conducted various war 
exercises including air maneuvers, landing exercises, and 
anti-aircraft and antiship exercises in the northern part of 
Kyonggi Province and Korea's West Sea near the Military 
Demarcation Line on a large scale. 
  All facts show that the U.S. forces occupying South Korean 
and the puppet army have assumed a full-scale posture to invade 
the North, thus the situation on the Korean peninsula has 
reached a touch-and-go stage.

Nuclear Issue" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification 
(Chongukyonhap) in a statement June 16 contended that the 
North's "nuclear issue" should be solved in a peaceful way 
through a package deal between the North and the United States, 
a Seoul-based radio report said. 
  The statement said a package solution whereby to renounce 
the 
hostile policy toward the North and normalize relations with it 
is the only way of securing the nuclear transparency of the 
North as the United States wants to see and, at the same time, 
of ensuring the safety of the entire nation of the Korean 
peninsula and defending world peace. 
  It urged the puppet authorities to oppose "sanctions" on the 
North and strive for a peaceful solution of the problem and to 
stop acts of creating "a situation for a new security-oriented 
rule" on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue" in a bid to 
suppress the national democratic movement and force "an 
endorsement of the Uruguay Round final agreement".

<F P=106> ["Suppression of Patriotic Students"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets sent several thousand police to the Hongik University in 
Seoul on June 18 and brutally suppressed students affiliated 
with the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General 
Student Councils (Namchongnyon) who were there. 
  In a swipe at the suppression, papers here [word indistinct] 
this is a special product of the military dictatorship which is 
unimaginable in a democratic society. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  Such a suppression is a rash act committed by those who took 
off even the "civilian" veil and openly unsheathed the sword of 
the military dictatorship. 
  As for the participation of students of Namchongnyon in the 
Seoul rally against the "parliamentary ratification of the 
Uruguay Round accord," there was nothing wrong in it. Checking 
the "endorsement of the accord" is vital to the existence of the 
people. 
  It is natural that South Korean students and people rose up 
in a struggle against the treacheries and despicable moves of 
the puppets. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is facing a serious ruling crisis for 
its policy of North-South confrontation and rice market opening 
it has persistently pursued since it came to power. 
  It is clear to every one that the puppets resorted to such 
brutal crackdown, consider that if they allowed students from 
local areas to participate in the Seoul rally against the 
"parliamentary endorsement of the accord," it would develop into 
a massive anti-"government" struggle. The fascist suppression, 
however, cannot save them from their hopeless position. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst demands that the Kim Yong-sam fascist 
clique promptly stop the suppression of patriotic students and 
release the innocent students under arrest, mindful that the 
intensified suppression will result only in precipitating their 
own destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) called a 
press conference on June 20 and strongly demanded that the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam make an open apology for having thrown riot 
police into five universities including Hongik University on 
June 18, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  It also demanded the resignation of the puppet prime 
minister 
and home minister. 
  It said the police intrusion into the universities was a 
preparation for railroading the treacherous "bill on the Uruguay 
Round world trade accord" through the "National Assembly" and 
urged the authorities to declare to the people their will to 
"renegotiate the Uruguay Round accord." It stressed that the 
accord must never be "ratified." 
  Hanchongnyon demanded that the puppet authorities 
immediately 
release the students who had been taken to the police and 
compensate for the damages done to the furniture.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- An inaugural meeting of 
the Indian Committee for the Repatriation to the North of Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners in South 
Korea, was held in New Delhi on June 9 on the occasion of the 
month of international solidarity with the Korean people (June 
25-July 27). 
  It was attended by M. Farooqi, secretary of the National 
Council of the Indian Communist Party, Jitendra Sharma, general 
secretary of the Indian Association of Lawyers, and others. 
  The participants strongly denounced the South Korean 
authorities for imprisoning and persecuting Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan, prisoners of war, for more than 30 years, in wanton 
violation of the international law, far from sending them back 
to the northern half of Korea where their families are waiting 
for them. 
  A letter of protest to the chief executive of South Korea 
was 
adopted at the meeting. 
  The letter condemned the South Korean authorities for 
unreasonably refusing to send Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan back to 
the North and demanded that they be repatriated without delay so 
that they may reunite with their families and relatives in the 
North.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Design Revealed" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Prime 
Minister, Tsutomu Hata, recently told the Budget Committee of 
the House of Councillors and the press group that Japan "has the 
capacity to possess nuclear weapons." 
  In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says his remarks fully 
revealed Japan's policy of nuclear armament which has reached 
the danger line. 
  The analyst says: 
  The Japanese reactionaries have accelerated nuclear arms 
development in secrecy, concealing a large quantity of plutonium 
under the cloak of "three non-nuclear principles." As Hata 
admitted, Japan has made all preparations and has now the 
capacity to massproduce nuclear weapons any time it wants. The 
nuclear armament of Japan is a matter of time. 
  Japan intends to become a nuclear power and give vent to its 
bitter grievances for its past defeat, behaving like a big 
power, and revive its old empire. Now the Japanese ruling 
circles are claiming that the use of nuclear weapons is not 
contrary to the international law, thus revealing their 
intention to produce nuclear weapons and use them in overseas 
aggression. Their alleged "maintenance of the three non-nuclear 
principles" and "efforts for nuclear non-proliferation" are 
nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the nuclear armament of 
Japan. 
  Japan is the only A-bomb victim in the world. For such a 
country to seek nuclear armament, forgetful of the lesson, is a 
foolish act inviting a nuclear holocaust.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 19 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves of the Japanese authorities are 
under fire in Japan. 
  Hidenori Sasaki, Social-Democratic member of the House of 
Representatives of Japan, said in a statement that the recent 
illegal search by the Kyoto prefectural police, long with the 
forcible search of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), 
shows the Japanese Government's stance to incite apprehensions 
over the "nuclear issue"of the DPRK among the people. 
  Osamuto Yadabe, Social-Democratic member of the House of 
Councillors, in a statement said that the current forcible 
search is a political suppression and an attempt to aggravate 
the situation on the Korean peninsula under the pretext of 
"nuclear suspicion of the DPRK and establish "emergency 
arrangement" in Japan. 
  The Kumamoto prefectural headquarters of the Japan 
Social-Democratic Party [JSDP], the Hokkaido Japan-Korea 
Solidarity Committee of Youths and Students for Supporting the 
Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea and other 
Japanese public organisations made public letters of protest 
addressed to the Japanese prime minister and the chief of the 
Kyoto prefectural police headquarters. The Hyogo Prefectural 
Society for Defending Human Rights of Koreans in Japan, the 60th 
general meeting of the Kochi prefectural headquarters of the 
Japan Social-Democratic Party and the Kagawa prefectural 
headquarters of the JSDP adopted a request, a resolution and a 
letter of protest denouncing the authorities' suppression of 
Chongnyon. The 11th meeting of Young Women for Japan-Korea 
Solidarity in Kochi prefecture adopted an appeal headlined "Let 
Us Pool Efforts for Independent Japan-Korea Solidarity and the 
Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea" and a letter of 
protest denouncing the authorities' unwarrantable suppression on 
Chongnyon. 
  The Japan-Korea Society for the Exchange of Scientific 
Education in an appeal called for further strengthening 
activities for friendship and solidarity with the Koreans in 
Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the Korean Buddhist Federation issued a statement Sunday 
denouncing the Japanese authorities' suppression of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans 
in Japan. 
  Noting that the Japanese police on June 6 raided the office 
of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and searched 
27 spots including houses of officials of the headquarters under 
the pretext of "violation of the national land utilization law," 
the statement bitterly denounced it in the name of the entire 
Buddhists of the DPRK as a vicious political suppression of 
Chongnyon and an open hostile act against the DPRK. 
  The statement said: 
  The Koreans in Japan are those who were drafted to Japan by 
the Japanese imperialists and forced to backbreaking toils in 
the past and their descendants. So they must enjoy special 
protection by the Japanese authorities. Far from apologizing to 
and compensating the Korean people for their past crimes, the 
Japanese authorities are suppressing them. This is a rash act 
that can be done only by villains bereft of reason. 
  We strongly demand the Japanese authorities immediately stop 
the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize 
for that and sternly punish the criminals. 
  We hope all the Buddhists of Japan will denounce the 
Japanese 
authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and express firm 
solidarity with Chongnyon in its righteous activities.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held at 
the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang on June 20 to 
introduce the book "Korea I Saw Again 40 Years After" written by 
Cuban woman lawyer Candelaria Rodriguez. 
  In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chin-pom, vice-chairman of 
the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, 
said that Cuban woman lawyer, the author of the book "Korea I 
saw Again 40 Years After", impressively wrote what she saw, 
heard and felt during her revisit to Korea 40 years after she 
visited Korea as a member of an international fact-finding team 
during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950- July 1953) and 
exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. 
  He expressed the hope that this book would help the 
revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer 
understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the 
socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary 
contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of 
expression. 
  Candelaria Rodriguez, the author of the book, spoke next. 
  Noting why she wrote the book, she said: 
  "I have come to write this book in order to inform the world 
people, even a little, of the true looks of Korea which rose 
like a phoenix from heaps of rubbles and has completely changed 
its appearance startling the world people under the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  In his speech, Han Pong-chan, deputy director general of the 
Foreign Press Group, noted that the book in Spanish was 
translated and published in French, Chinese, English and Russian 
and disseminated among foreigners. This book, he added, will 
greatly encourage not only the Korean people in their tireless 
efforts to defend and further glorify the Korean-style socialism 
centred on the masses but also the revolutionary people of the 
world in their righteous struggle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Marshal 
Kim Chong-il received a congratulatory message on Sunday from 
the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on the 30th anniversary of 
the start of work by him at the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  The message says: 
  "You, respected general, took the first step of your great 
leadership at the WPK Central Committee on June 19, 1964. This 
was a historical event which definitely guaranteed the 
inheritance and accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of 
chuche. 
  "You have glorified the immortal chuche idea as the great 
guiding idea of our era and strengthened and developed the WPK 
to see that miracles and changes for the century were effected 
in the revolution and construction with the might of the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. 
  "You, respected comrade supreme commander with unexcelled 
grit, iron will, brilliant resources and commanding art of a 
famous general who descended from the heaven, have reared the 
People's Army into a matchless army each man of which `can match 
a hundred foes' and made Korea of chuche rise up imposingly as 
an impregnable military power. 
  "Your astonishing revolutionary feats in leading the 
worldwide movement for rebuilding socialism along a straight 
road to victory, displaying the invincibility of anthropocentric 
Korean-style socialism under the grim situation in which the 
imperialists and reactionaries are getting hysteric in the moves 
to stifle the DPRK on all sides are throwing brilliant rays on 
human history." 
  The message states that Chongnyon will successfully 
discharge 
its noble duty in the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause 
of chuche, trusting and following only the respected general in 
the future, too. 
  It wishes the respected Supreme Commander General Kim 
Chong-il a long life in good health.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 19 June editorial: "Path of Glory Along </F>
Which We Have Marched on Victoriously Upholding the Great 
Leader"] 
  [Text] Today, our party and people are vigorously waging 
the struggle to consummate the cause of socialism of our own 
style, overflowing with confidence in victory and grit. On the 
grand march of audaciously smashing the imperialists' 
antisocialist maneuvers and vigorously marching on, the 
single-hearted unity around the leader [yongdoja] has been all 
the more strengthened and the base of our socialism has been 
consolidated impregnably. 
  Under such a thrilling [pokchan] atmosphere, we are 
observing 
a meaningful day marking Comrade Kim Chong-il's, the dear leader 
of our party and people, 30th anniversary of working at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  Our party members and people, who look back with deep 
emotion 
on the past 30 years of history in which they have marched 
following the great guidance, are filled with great pride and 
dignity of upholding the peerless man. They are filled with 
firm resolve to endlessly glorify our party's leadership 
achievements. 
  Three decades ago, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
began 
to lead the party work, responding to the desire of all the 
people and the requirement of the developing revolution. It was 
a great event of historic significance in the development of the 
party and the revolution. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The 
question of inheriting the leadership has been successfully 
solved in our country because Comrade Kim Chong-il wisely guided 
the overall work of the party, the state, and the Army from a 
long time ago. 
  The working class cause of revolution and party building has 
been pioneered by the leader [suryong] and is inherited and 
consummated by the leader [yongdoja] who is endlessly faithful 
to the leader's [suryong] cause. Upholding the leader [chidoja] 
who has distinguished resources and traits of leadership at the 
head of the party and revolution is a fundamental problem 
deciding the destiny and future of the revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great leader 
[yongdoja] who has a rare ideological and theoretical wisdom, 
excelled in the art of leadership, and the invincible art of 
military operations. He is a true leader [chidoja] of the 
people who has both literary and military accomplishments. 
  With Comrade Kim Chong-il leading the party work, a broad 
road has opened to glorify the party forever as a revolutionary 
party of chuche and accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche 
pioneered in the thick forests of Mt. Paektu. 
  We cannot think about the indomitable might of today's WPK, 
the grand appearance of our ever-victorious socialist 
fatherland, and the bright future for our revolution and nation, 
apart from this historical event in which a great guiding hand 
of our party work has reached. 
  The past 30 years in which our people have advanced, 
following the illustrious leader, are glorious decades in which 
the most brilliant era has opened in the development of the 
party and the revolution and decades of victory and feats. 
  Our revolution's atmosphere at home and abroad was difficult 
and arduous in the past and immense tasks of struggle have been 
laid before our party. However, thanks to the leadership of the 
dear comrade leader who has shouldered all the burdens of the 
chuche-oriented revolutionary cause and the cause of party 
building and led our party and people to one road of 
invincibility, our revolution has vigorously marched on the one 
road of chuche pioneered by the great leader [suryong] in the 
thick forest of Mt. Paektu. During these days, an era of great 
creation and reform that can be labelled as a heyday of the WPK 
has come to this land and the question of inheriting the 
revolutionary cause has been brilliantly solved in conformity 
with the demand of the times and our people's ardent aspirations. 
  By leading the party from the 1960's to the 1990's in which 
most upheaval events of the century took place, the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed immortal feats for the era 
and the revolution that will shine long in history. 
  The history of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
revolutionary activities is a glorious and brilliant history of 
struggle of a distinguished thinker and theoretician who has 
immensely exalted the chuche idea as the guiding idea of the era 
with his rare intelligence. 
  [Text] Resolutely adhering to and enriching the leadership 
ideology created by the leader [suryong] are the most important 
work in completing the independent cause of the popular masses. 
  From his early days, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
with rare energy and inquiring spirit, has waged creative 
ideological and theoretical activities. By doing so, he has 
developed and enriched the leader's [suryong] revolutionary 
ideas in conformity with the people's aspiration and the demand 
of times at a time when the question of inheriting the 
revolutionary cause has been raised. 
  This course has been the path in which the trend of all 
sorts of reactionary and opportunistic ideologies have been 
sharply criticized and the essence of the working class' 
revolutionary idea has been adhered to. This course has also 
been the days of creative contemplation in which unpredictable 
new theoretical and practical questions arising in the 
revolution and construction have been explained with the 
iron-willed theories. 
  On this historic course, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's revolutionary ideas have been formalized as a 
monolithic system of the chuche ideological and theoretical 
method, and all the components have been completely enriched and 
developed as new principles and contents. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has published many 
works 
during the past 30 years, including the works published on 19 
February and 2 August, 1974, "On the Chuche Idea," "Historic 
Lessons From Socialist Construction and Our Party's General 
Line," and "On the Fundamental Questions of Our Revolutionary 
Party Building." These works are an undying banner that enables 
our party and people to carry forward the revolutionary cause of 
chuche to accomplishment, and a powerful ideological and 
theoretical weapon that leads the socialist cause of our era 
along an ever-victorious road. 
  Truly, an era led by the dear comrade leader is a proud era 
in which the chuche idea, sowed on the soil of our people and 
brought up as a dense forest by the great leader [suryong], has 
been glorified as a great leading idea presenting the present 
time and the future of communism. 
  The course in which the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has 
led the party work is a glorious history of the great leader 
[yongdoja], who has set examples for the era in the building of 
a revolutionary party and strengthened and developed the party 
into an ever-victorious chuche type party. 
  Our party has a long history of struggle which runs up to 70 
years from the day it struck its root. The last 30 years among 
the long history of struggle have been glorified as proud annals 
in which the most brilliant victory has been attained and the 
party's political might has been remarkably strengthened. 
  Raising the issue of strengthening the party and enhancing 
the leadership role of the party as a basic link to leading the 
revolution and construction, the dear comrade leader has for the 
last 30 years put his heart and soul into promoting our party in 
a revolutionary manner. 
  The dear comrade leader's leadership over party building and 
party work is consistent with firmly adhering to the chuche 
lineage and making our party have traits befitting the 
chuche-type party. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
leadership hand aimed at breaking the old flame remaining in the 
party work and fundamentally innovating the party's feature has 
reached every part of party building, including the building of 
party organization, ideology, and the art of leadership. 
  Guided by the dear comrade leader, the party has been 
strengthened and developed into a steel-like party with 
unbreakable singlehearted unity and a solid organizational and 
ideological foundation; a general staff of the revolution 
leading the socialist cause of chuche to a victory with tested 
leadership art; and a great revolutionary party that has struck 
its roots deep among the popular masses and formed a harmonious 
whole with them. 
  Today, the invincible might, combat capacity, and high 
dignity cherished by the WPK are connected with the name of the 
dear comrade leader who has led the cause of party building for 
several years at the fore, under the slogan of modelling the 
entire party after the chuche idea. The course of the 
revolutionary activities of Comrade Kim Chong-il is proud annals 
of an experienced, veteran statesman and a great strategist, who 
has firmly defended the socialist cause of our own style and 
powerfully displayed the dignity and honor of socialism. 
  [Text] Today, the imperialists are viciously maneuvering 
more than ever before to isolate and obliterate socialism of our 
own style. Our socialism is advancing without the slightest 
wavering under today's situation in which the antirevolutionary 
offensive is being strengthened. This is because of the great 
leadership of the dear comrade leader, who possesses an 
iron-like will and extraordinary leadership, and the most solid 
political, economic, and military might achieved by the dear 
comrade leader. 
  Under the slogan, "Modeling the whole society under the 
chuche idea," the dear comrade leader called for vigorously 
carrying out the three revolutions in all fields of the 
revolution and construction, thus he unfolded a great flowering 
period of socialism of our own style centered on the popular 
masses on this land. 
  Socialism of our own style, which is being led and 
elucidated 
by the dear comrade leader, is socialism which is formed by a 
strong main force of the revolution in which all the people are 
firmly united around the party and the leader; socialism 
endlessly developing above the firm basis of self-dependence, 
self-support, and self-reliant defense; and socialism in which 
the people's independent and creative lives are in full bloom. 
  In the long course of the revolution, the dear comrade 
leader 
has provided a strong and mighty national defense power that can 
firmly carry out our socialist cause in any environment. 
  The dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is the greatest military 
strategist and iron-willed commander of the present time. By 
highly upholding the dear comrade leader as the supreme 
commander, our People's Army today has grown to become an army 
of the party and an army of the revolution in which the 
revolutionary army trait is firmly standing throughout the whole 
army, and a peerless strong army that is provided with both a 
strong offensive and defensive means. Thus, our fatherland has 
been changed into an impregnable fortress. 
  There has been no time as today in the history of our 
country 
in which the main force of the revolution has been strengthened 
politically, ideologically, militarily, and technically by 
highly upholding the dear comrade leader, who is a general among 
generals. 
  Today's proud reality is that all the people and officers 
and 
men of the People's Army are resolutely safeguarding the 
respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il by being of the same 
mind. This embraces the firm confidence of a bright future of 
socialism of our own style. 
  Today, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is receiving 
absolute support and respect from the entire party, all the 
people, and the entire Army due to the infinite loyalty and 
devotion toward the fatherland, people, and revolution, and 
immortal achievements fulfilled in the process of carrying out 
the chuche revolutionary cause. He also possesses a high 
dignity among the world's revolutionary people which cannot be 
taken away. 
  Our people have no greater good fortune than to uphold the 
dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is leading the revolutionary 
cause toward the one road of victory by possessing a brilliant 
wisdom, refined leadership, and lofty virtue, at the top of the 
party, state, and main force of the revolution. We will deeply 
bear in mind this good fortune and honor, and must vigorously 
accelerate the onward march to achieve complete victory of 
socialism, advance the fatherland's independent reunification, 
and complete the chuche revolutionary cause to the end. 
  Consolidating airtight the invincible cohesion and unity of 
the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army centered 
on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the fundamental 
source of all of our victories. The struggle course of the past 
30 years was a process of succeeding generation after generation 
the glorious tradition of the single-hearted unity of our 
revolution. 
  Just like the youth communists and people firmly united with 
faith and integrity by centering around the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song during the pioneering period of the Korean 
revolution, we must put forth our dear comrade leader at the 
center of unity and center of leadership. Also, since the party 
and the ranks of the revolution were single-heartedly united 
around him like bedrock, the life of the chuche revolutionary 
cause has been firmly succeeded. 
  Let us unite, unite, and unite centered around the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il! This is our everlasting struggle 
slogan and motto which has not changed in the past and will not 
change today or tomorrow. All the functionaries and party 
members must adhere to the single-hearted unity of the entire 
party centered around the dear comrade leader like their eyes, 
wholly manifest its might, and further consolidate the party's 
organizational and ideological basis. 
  [Text] We should thoroughly establish a revolutionary ethos 
in which the entire party, the whole country, and all the Army 
move as one and unconditionally implement the party's line, 
decisions, and instructions under the leadership of the dear 
comrade leader. We should also enhance the sense of party 
organization and further strengthen our party life. Thus, we 
should demonstrate the might of our singlehearted united party. 
The solidness and might of our singlehearted unity lie in the 
fact that they are based on their absolute respect toward the 
leader [yongdoja]. 
  All party members and working people should entrust their 
destiny to the dear comrade leader, firmly believing him as the 
defender of their destiny, and should firmly prepare themselves 
to become true loyalists who resolutely defend their party and 
their leader [yongdoja]. 
  We should live and struggle in a revolutionary manner with 
the resolute courage and optimism that only if there is the 
respected and beloved General Kim chong-il's leadership can we 
be victorious without fail and sternly smash any challenge and 
maneuvers for aggression by the imperialists. 
  Resolutely defending the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
leadership achievement and glorifying it forever is a most 
important task to constantly advance and consummate our 
revolution. The great leadership achievements by the dear 
comrade leader in his 30 years' revolutionary path are the most 
precious revolutionary assets for the infinite prosperity of our 
fatherland and for the final victory of the revolution. 
  For our revolutionary fighters who have grown up amid the 
bosom of the party and who have enjoyed infinite happiness under 
the leader's [yongdoja] great love and benevolence there is no 
more sacred duty than to glorify his immortal leadership 
achievements. 
  We should deeply cherish in our hearts the greatness of the 
dear comrade leader's leadership achievements and should see to 
it that all of our works and lives become a course of defending 
and glorifying his leadership achievements. 
  The trace of the dear comrade leader's immortal leadership 
is 
clearly reflected in all outposts where our party members and 
working people work. All party organizations and functionaries 
should establish measures to thoroughly implement the dear 
comrade leader's policies and remarks at his on-the-spot 
guidances and should constantly carry out this work. In this 
way, we should see to it that the dear comrade leader's great 
leadership achievements are glorified forever. 
  We are faced with the heavy task of more vigorously 
accelerating the general march of socialism of our own style 
upholding the party's grand socialist construction plan. Today's 
majestic advance is an honorable and rewarding struggle to 
vigorously demonstrate to the world the indomitable mettle and 
might of our people who are blessed with the dear leader's 
leadership. 
  All party members and the working people should achieve a 
decisive advance in the struggle to implement the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy by displaying the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and, thus, should enhance 
the superiority of the popular mass-centered socialism of our 
own style. We should accelerate the revolution and construction 
with a strained and mobilized posture and should effect a new 
upsurge in all sectors of economic construction and national 
defense construction. 
  All officers and men of the Korean People's Army should 
cherish deeper in their hearts the sacred mission of firmly 
defending with rifle the party's cause, that is, the respected 
and beloved General Kim Chong-il's cause; should thoroughly 
implement the supreme commander's order; and, thus, should 
firmly deepen the might of our Army. We should also lead the 
laudable custom of army-people unity, which has reached a high 
plane in the course of upholding the respected and beloved 
comrade supreme commander, to be brought to fuller bloom in the 
whole society. 
  Today, the enemies of the revolution are viciously running 
wild. However, the future of our revolution is bright, and our 
victory is certain. 
  Let all of us firmly unite around the dear leader Comrade 
Kim 
Chong-il and more vigorously advance for the final victory of 
the chuche revolutionary cause and for national reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- A great many works of 
literature and art high in ideological and artistic value have 
been created in Korea. 
  In the last few years alone, many literary and art works 
have 
been created, among them the multi-part feature film "The Nation 
and Destiny" (part 1 to 18), the revolutionary drama "Under the 
Banner of Victory" and the long novel "Victory". 
  The literature and art of Korea that greeted a great heyday 
in the mid-70s under the wise guidance of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il is now in full bloom with further 
development. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il founded a unique theory on the 
chuche-oriented literature and art that is centred on man, and 
established a new creative system to bring an overall renovation 
in literature and art and has reared a large army of talented 
men of literature and art. He gave answers to all the 
theoretical and practical questions arising in the creative work 
such as making a good choice of seed and conducting a speed 
campaign in creative activities, making a comprehensive and 
profound study of life and reflecting it truthfully and 
retaining the national style in works through the combination of 
ideology and art and has successfully brought into full bloom 
the literature and art with untiring energetic guidances. 
  All realms of literature and art -- movie, opera, music, 
drama, dance, fine art and circus -- have reached a high plane 
today. 
  In this course, a host of literary and art works have been 
created, representing the glorious and brilliant history of 
revolutionary activities, sagacity of leadership and noble 
virtues of the great leader President Kim Il-song, and new 
"phibada"-style revolutionary operas in which stanzaic songs, 
pangchang(off-stage songs), folk dances and stage decor are 
organically interlinked and new "songhwangdang"- style 
revolutionary dramas. 
  Works on the themes of revolutionary traditions and 
socialist 
realities were created in great numbers, including the feature 
film "To the End of the World" and "The Trace of Life", the long 
and medium-length novels "On the Road of Loyalty" and "The Land 
of Flowers", the music and dance epic "Song of Glory" performed 
by 5,000 artistes and the music and dance story "The Song of 
Paradise". 
  Many famous songs and elegant dance works such as "Song of 
Comradeship", "We Will Go Along One Road Forever" and "Azalea of 
the Homeland" were created, national musical instruments were 
improved and a new orchestra based on the combination of Western 
and national music instruments was created, lifting the chuche 
art to a higher stage. 
  Recent years witnessed the creation of unique Korean-style 
electronic music which can represent not only the Korean folk 
songs and modern songs but foreign folk songs and traditional 
mass songs of other countries as well. 
  In the meantime, monumental works of art such as the 
"Mansudae Grand Monument" and the "Samjiyon Grand Monument" have 
been created and various genres of works of art including 
paintings, mainly Korean paintings, crafts and embroideries have 
been produced. 
  Acrobatic art and literature and art of amateurs have also 
made a rapid progress.

  [Text] The two biggest opposition parties, Chat Thai and 
Chat Phatthana, have expressed guarded interest in joining a new 
Democrat-led coalition government in the event the current 
crisis facing the Chuan administration leads to a Cabinet 
shake-up. 
  Chat Thai Secretary-General Sano Thianthong said yesterday 
the Chat Thai Party and its opposition allies are "ready to 
serve" and prepared to discuss the possibility of joining the 
government. 
  Chat Phatthana Deputy Leader Kon Thappharangsi insisted 
yesterday that Chat Phatthana would not "go it alone" in joining 
the Democrat-led coalition but said his party would consider 
becoming part of a future government only if Prime Minister 
Chuan Likhpai resigned as prime minister to pave the way for the 
formation of a new government. 
  Sano said although opposition parties had not anticipated 
becoming part of a coalition government led by Chuan, "anything 
is possible" under present circumstances. 
  "We are prepared to serve the country. Politicians, 
regardless of their political affiliation, have the 
responsibility to serve," Sano said. 
  However, he said Chat Thai and other opposition parties had 
not been approached by the core of the present coalition 
government regarding a possible Cabinet shake-up to replace any 
existing coalition parties with opposition parties. 
  "Anything is possible. We only need to talk," Sano said. 
  It was still not clear whether Sano was speaking on behalf 
of 
the Chat Thai Party alone or was voicing a common stance of the 
opposition bloc which includes other major parties like Chat 
Phatthana and Social Action. 
  Chat Thai, which controls 77 seats in the House of 
Representatives, is the biggest party in the opposition bloc and 
is second only to the Democrat Party. 
  Senior members of Chat Phatthana which commands 60 seats in 
the House, have in recent weeks also expressed interest in 
joining the Democrat-led coalition government. 
  Asked about the possibility of the Democrat Party replacing 
its foul current coalition partners with members of the 
opposition bloc, Sano said the opposition parties had not been 
waiting to join the Chuan government. 
  "In fact, opposition parties have agreed not to join the 
coalition government under any circumstance," he said. 
  But asked whether the opposition parties would insist on a 
total Cabinet shake-up as precondition for joining the 
coalition, Sano said they would not make known their position 
until they were approached by the coalition government. 
  "The opposition is prepared for discussions with the 
coalition government. We are politicians and we don't 
discriminate against our colleagues because of their political 
affiliation," Sano said. 
  Asked to comment on the likelihood of a new alliance of 
Democrat, Chat Thai and New Aspiration in a coalition 
government, Sano said: "Whether such an arrangement would work 
out depends very much on whether the (future) coalition 
government could forge unity among its partners." 
  "I am in no position to boast about our (Chat Thai's) 
capability in administering the country. We have been in the 
government several times before. The public is the judge," Sano 
said.

  [Text] The Australian government has described the closure 
of three Indonesian news magazines as very disappointing. 
  The Indonesian government yesterday banned TEMPO, the 
country's leading news magazine, and the popular publications 
DETIC and EDITOR. 
  Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said that the 
prime minister, Paul Keating, would go ahead with his visit to 
Indonesia next week despite a call that the trip be cancelled. 
  Senator Evans told parliament Mr. Keating would choose how 
he 
conveyed Australia's concerns during his talks with President 
Suharto and senior Indonesian ministers. 
  [Begin Evans recording] It must be said without 
qualification 
that this is a very disappointing development indeed. In recent 
times with the support or acceptance of this government 
Indonesia has been making very rapid progress to a genuinely 
free and open expression through a free media, reflecting in 
that respect the rapidly growing openness which has been 
developing in the country's economy and society more generally. 
Yesterday's decision is in sharp contrast to that trend so far 
as the media is concerned. We hope that it doesn't signal any 
wider ranging impositions and that the magazines will, sooner 
rather than later, be permitted to resume publication. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter returned to South Korea from Pyongyang via the 
truce village of Panmunjom Saturday morning after meeting with 
North Korean leaders to resolve the nuclear dispute. 
  Upon his return to Seoul, Carter will brief President Kim 
Yong- sam at Chongwadae [presidential offices] on the contents 
of his two rounds of talks with Kim Il-song during his four-day 
visit to the North Korean capital. 
  Carter, escorted by a North Korean army colonel, arrived at 
the Military Demarcation Line in Panmunjom at 8:35 a.m. to be 
greeted by American Ambassador James Laney and Southern 
officials. 
  He posed briefly for scores of cameramen in the Southern 
sector of the truce village before heading to Seoul. 
  During his meeting with Carter, President Kim is expected to 
explain his government's stance toward the latest developments 
in the nuclear row. 
  Prior to visiting Chongwadae, the former American president 
is to meet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu at the U.S. 
ambassador's residence to discuss steps that Seoul and 
Washington can take on the nuclear issue based on the outcome of 
Carter's talks in Pyongyang. 
  Carter is scheduled to meet with the press at the 
ambassador's residence Saturday afternoon before leaving for the 
United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 18 (YONHAP) -- Former President Jimmy 
Carter was assigned a mission by the American Government to 
convey to North Korea a U.S. proposal on directly linking the 
nuclear problem with bilateral diplomatic relations, a Japanese 
daily reported from Seoul on Saturday. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN quoted a diplomatic source in Seoul as 
saying the proposal is a "two-stage comprehensive deal" in which 
the two countries would form diplomatic ties after North Korea 
cleared up international suspicions over its nuclear program. 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song seemingly showed a more 
progressive attitude at his two meetings with Carter since he 
rated the proposal positively. 
  The source was quoted as saying that in the first of the two 
stages, Washington would provide economic support and allow the 
establishment of representatives in each country in response to 
Pyongyang's remaining in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT) and accepting special and routine inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The economic support would include financial and 
technological assistance for North Korea's changing of 
heavy-water reactors to light-water units, according to the 
paper. 
  The source said that in the second stage, after Pyongyang 
had 
accepted special IAEA inspections of two undeclared atomic 
facilities to allay suspicion about its nuclear development 
program, the United States would be willing to open diplomatic 
ties with North Korea, according to the paper. 
  It is the first time for the United States to present a 
proposal that includes normalization of diplomatic relations 
with North Korea. 
  The source said that Carter apparently put the proposal to 
Kim Il-song at their first meeting on Thursday. 
  He speculated that Kim Il-song allowed the IAEA inspectors 
to 
stay in North Korea and mentioned his country's return to the 
NPT in response to the first stage.

  [Text] Washington, June 21 KYODO -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday [21 June] he plans to 
discuss macroeconomic and sectoral issues when he meets Japanese 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa this weekend in Los Angeles. 
  Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening, Kantor said he 
expects 
his discussion with Kakizawa to cover all aspects of the 
so-called framework trade talks with Japan. 
  But Kantor did not give a precise date for the planned 
meeting, saying it depends on Kakizawa's schedule. 
  Under the framework negotiations designed to rectify the 
chronic trade imbalance between the two countries, the U.S. is 
pressing Japan to set "objective criteria" to measure progress 
in market-opening. 
  But Tokyo rejects binding criteria, saying they could lead 
to 
managed trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Wednesday [22 June] Japan wants to conclude the 
trade "framework" talks with the United States as soon as 
possible in view of the rapid rise of yen against the dollar. 
  Kakizawa made the remark to reporters after a 20-minute 
meeting with U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshevsky at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Barshevsky is visiting Japan to hold a subcabinet-level 
meeting on government procurement with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sadayuki Hayashi later in the day and on Thursday. 
  Kakizawa quoted Barshevsky as saying the U.S. wants to wrap 
up the framework talks as early as possible because of pressures 
from the Congress and from the market. 
  He said he replied that considering the rapid yen's rise, 
Japan also wants an early conclusion to the trade negotiations. 
  Barshevsky carried a message to Kakizawa from U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor saying he wants to meet the 
Japanese foreign minister to discuss the framework talks for an 
early conclusion, Kakizawa said. 
  In Washington, Kantor said Tuesday he plans to discuss 
macroeconomic and sectoral issues when he meets Kakizawa this 
weekend in Los Angeles, although he did not give an exact date 
for the planned meeting. 
  Kantor said his discussion with Kakizawa will cover all 
aspects of the framework trade talks with Japan. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials quoted Kakizawa as 
saying in the meeting with Barshevsky that his trip to the 
United States is not yet set. 
  Kakizawa expressed hope that the subcabinet-level talks will 
make progress, the officials said.

contact for North-South top-level talks [choegowigup hoedam], 
Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK Administration Council, today 
sent a telephone message to South Korean Prime Minister Yi

  The content of the telephone message is as follows: 
  Bringing an end to North-South mistrust and confrontation 
and 
opening a new phase in independently and peacefully reunifying 
the fatherland without depending on outside force through 
top-level talks is a policy we have consistently adhered to for 
a long time. The tense situation in the country today makes it 
all the more urgent for the North and South to hold top-level 
talks. 
  I think it fortunate that at such a time your side has 
expressed the position of holding top-level talks this time and, 
under authorization, notify your side that we welcome your 
side's proposal for holding a preliminary contact for 
North-South top-level talks and agree to it. 
  Holding the top-level talks of the two sides will be a 
historic event that will give our 70 million fellow countrymen 
the joy of national reconciliation and unity and a new hope for 
peace in the country and its independent, peaceful reunification. 
  To successfully hold North-South top-level talks, on which 
attention from home and abroad has been focused, our side will 
send a three-member delegation led by a vice premier-level 
official and four accompanying officials to your side's area in 
Panmunjom at 1000 on 28 June, Tuesday.

  [Text] Newspapers, news agencies, and broadcast stations 
of various countries reported on Former U.S. President Carter's 
visit to our country. The U.S. paper THE NEW YORK TIMES carried 
a large photograph of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
posing with former U.S. President Carter and his entourage on 
the top of the 19 June issue along with an article headlined 
"Carter Pays Respect to President Kim Il-song." 
  The article reports: Former President Carter spoke highly of 
President Kim Il-song. He said that President Kim Il-song is 
full of energy and wisdom and surprisingly has a full grasp of 
technical problems and the country's decisions. Carter said: 
"I believe there is no evidence that North Korea is developing 
nuclear weapons." After his visit to North Korea, Carter 
expressed his respect for President Kim Il-song in Seoul and 
denounced that the Clinton administration's sanction efforts are 
meaningless. 
  Another U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST reported on 19 June 
that Former President Carter expressed respect and admiration 
for the leader [yondoja] of North Korea by saying that President 
Kim Il-song is very energetic and intelligent, well-versed in 
every issue, and instantly grasped the points of the issues 
raised during the conversation. The paper added that Carter 
said he believed the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks would be 
held soon. 
  Meanwhile, on 19 June, U.S. television CNN reported on 
Carter's remarks during his news conference as follows: 
President Kim Il-song is an energetic and intelligent person 
respected by his assistant functionaries. He even talks to them 
openheartedly. He is always respected by the people. Mr. 
[sonsaengnim] Kim Chong-il is a very energetic man and the whole 
society is filled with respect for him. 
  The British broadcast station BBC reported that Carter said 
he hoped that the talks between the United States and North 
Korea would be held as soon as possible. 
  On 20 June, Voice of America reported on the conversation 
between Former U.S. President Carter and President Clinton as 
follows: Former U.S. President Carter said on 19 June that he 
thinks North Korea's nuclear crisis is over. Carter reported 
his opinion to President Clinton and pointed out that he had 
come to the conclusion after a long discussion with an assistant 
secretary in charge of national security. Former U.S. President 
Carter had a 30-minute telephone conversation with President 
Clinton at the White House. A White House official revealed 
that Carter had a meeting with an assistant secretary in charge 
of national security for two hours and said the meeting was very 
useful and constructive. Carter showed satisfaction after the 
meeting. Carter said that he thinks the United States does not 
need to make efforts to pursue sanctions against North Korea in 
the United Nations. 
  The radio reported that Carter said that there is no discord 
between his and the Clinton government's opinions. The radio 
also reported that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci 
said his meeting with Former President Carter was very useful 
and effective. 
  On 20 June, Japan's KYODO News Agency reported that U.S. 
President Clinton said that there are hopeful signs regarding 
North Korea's nuclear crisis and that it will be beneficial for 
us to avoid additional measures and hold talks with North Korea. 
  Meanwhile, the White House spokeswoman said that the United 
States will enter a stage of preparations for the resumption of 
the third round of the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The 19 June issue of the Cuban JUVENTUD REBELDE reported 
that 
Carter said to the journalists on 18 June that there will be a 
reverse effect if sanctions are imposed on the DPRK in regard to 
the nuclear issue, and stressed that sanctions against Pyongyang 
will be an intolerable humiliation to the North Korean people. 
  On 20 June, Russia's ITAR-TASS reported on Carter's 
interview 
with U.S. CNN as follows: I admitted that we, the United 
States, are driving ourselves into a corner. I felt that North 
Korea cannot be intimidated by threat or pressure. The news 
agency also reported that, according to the former U.S. 
President, even if sanctions are imposed, it will not affect 
North Korea.

a national unity government firmly under his control. He said he 
would give high positions to the Khmer Rouge so the faction 
would halt its guerilla war. 
  But Sihanouk stressed that he would only assume power with 
the approval of parliament and the two leaders of the coalition 
government, especially Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose 
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) controls the bulk of the army, 
security forces and apparatus of state. 
  Since it came to power through United Nations-sponsored 
elections in May 1993, "the current government has shown that it 
is not capable of stopping the process of deterioration of the 
situation," Sihanouk said during the three-hour interview on 
June 11 at his residence in Beijing, where he is being treated 
for cancer. "How can I avoid intervening in a few months' time 
or one year's time if the situation continues to deteriorate?" 
  Sihanouk, 72, was elected king and head of state last year 
by 
parliament, but the role carries little real authority. "If I am 
not too weak physically, I will certainly say yes" to a request 
from parliament to assume real power, he said. 
  "I have no plan to take power now," as the situation "is not 
desperate enough," Sihanouk said. "In case the situation becomes 
anarchic and desperate, I would have to take power for one or 
two years. I did it in 1952 and 1953 to put an end to the 
anarchy of the kingdom . . . so why not now before I die, the 
last mission?" 
  Sihanouk's statements may tap a well-spring of popular 
discontent shared by a number of influential figures within 
Cambodia's government, military and parliament who are 
frustrated by their leaders' inability to achieve peace and 
stability following last year's elections. These figures, 
according to political sources, have been quietly campaigning 
for Sihanouk to assume more power to break the deadlock in peace 
talks with the Khmer Rouge. Both Hun Sen and First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the royalist Funcinpec 
party, refuse any political deal that would give the radical 
faction a role in government. 
  The king recognised that neither Ranariddh nor Hun Sen would 
be eager to be replaced as premier. "I know that Mr. Hur Sen 
will be red in the face...when he will read your article," 
Sihanouk said. "He wil] say that 'we were absolutely wrong to 
elect Sihanouk as king, it is extremely bad, extremely 
dangerous, and now he wants to retake power and to take the 
Khmer Rouge again in his government. It will be a catastrophe.' 
Mr. Hun Sen will attack me very, very violently. I know that." 
  Sihanouk acknowledged that his bid for power would be doomed 
without the acquiescence of Hun Sen and the CPP. "If he does not 
support me, it is useless for me to go back to Cambodia, because 
I do not want to shed blood to fight a secession led by Hun 
Sen," he said. "I cannot return to power to go back to Cambodia 
unless I have the assurance that Hun Sen and his party will join 
me in my government." 
  "As far as Ranariddh is concerned, I am sure that my son 
will 
not betray me," the king continued. "He will accept certainly. 
Not with joy. With sadness, certainly. With anger, certainly. 
But he will, I am sure, not rebel." 
  Ranariddh has argued for more time in power, saying results 
will be visible next year, Sihanouk said. "But there is another 
opinion among the people and the politicians. The other opinion 
is that if they allow this government to go on for one year, 
Cambodia will completely collapse -- not just the government but 
the country itself." 
  Sihanouk said his plan for a new government was "very 
simple. 
I will be the head of the government. Not just the head of 
state, but the head of government. This means my own prime 
minister." The regime would have four vice-presidents: 
Ranariddh, Hun Sen, current Finance Minister Sam Rainsy and 
Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan. "My government can only be one 
of national unity with all parties," he said. "I will give 
important portfolios to the Khmer Rouge." 
  Anticipating the objections of the two elected premiers, the 
king qualified his remarks. "I stress to Ranariddh and Hun Sen, 
I want them to know I have no plan to replace them. If one day 
there is a necessity for Sihanouk to intervene, I wait for a 
signal from the parliament, a request from the parliament, not 
from demonstrations .... Even with a request from parliament, I 
will not accept to take power unless Ranariddh and Hun Sen say, 
'okay, we join you, we accept to be in your government of 
national unity'." 
  Cambodia's constitution allows the parliament, by a 
two-thirds vote, to give extraordinary powers to the king during 
a time of crisis. This is what supporters of the burgeoning 
movement to install Sihanouk in power are aiming for -- 
essentially a constitutional coup led by members of the two 
major governing parties behind the backs of their own leaders. 
In fact, Sihanouk noted in the interview that a number of senior 
"politicians, figures in the military and in the administration" 
had appealed to him to seize power in recent months. 
  Sihanouk said his programme would be much the same as that 
of 
the current government: "the rehabilitation and reconstruction 
of the country." Parliament would also be maintained. "The only 
difference is...no war with the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer Rouge 
in my government. It is the only change! The only change! But it 
is the very, very basis of my process of saving Cambodia." 
  Aides say that Sihanouk will try to come back to Cambodia in 
July, depending on the outcome of medical tests to assess the 
state of his cancer. He appears strong and lively to his many 
visitors. "I still have cancer cells in my bone marrow, but I 
feel quite normal," the king said. 
  Sihanouk said his wife and confidante, Queen Monique, 
strongly opposed the idea of his resuming power. "So, you know I 
will lose even my wife. But to lose my wife, to lose Mr. Hun Sen 
is nothing compared to Cambodia. For me, Cambodia is my life. If 
Cambodia sinks I have no reason to survive. I have no reason to 
live. I prefer dying."

  [Text] The total amount of U.S.-made auto parts which 11 
Japanese automakers purchased (through local procurement and 
imports) in fiscal 1993 reached $15.54 billion, a 14.1 percent 
increase over the previous fiscal year. A slight increase in 
each automaker's purchase of U.S. parts is due to such factors 
as the leveling off of local production in the United States and 
a slump in exports following the yen's appreciation. Although 
automakers have spelled out a goal of increasing the annual 
purchase of U.S.-made parts to $19 billion in fiscal 1994, under 
the current situation it is impossible to also expect a sharp 
increase this fiscal year. Because it seems difficult for them 
to achieve the goal, this will likely affect the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, which are now in progress. 
  Fiscal 1993 is the second year of implementing the 
"voluntary 
plans" [for purchasing U.S. auto parts], which were announced by 
each automaker after Japan-U.S. summit talks in early 1992. 
Nissan Motor Co.'s purchase of U.S. parts reached nearly $3.5 
billion in fiscal 1993, a 48 percent increase over fiscal 1992. 
This increase is the largest among Japanese automakers. Its 
imports of U.S. auto parts remained at the same level as the 
previous fiscal year due to a decrease in imports following the 
yen's appreciation. However, local production in the United 
States increased by 21 percent thanks to good sales of its 
popular cars, and the percentage of local procurement of parts 
increased sharply. 
  Toyota Motor Corporation -- whose purchasing goal for fiscal 
1994 accounts for one-third of the "$19 billion" -- purchased 
U.S. auto parts totalling $4.65 billion in fiscal 1993, a 4.9 
percent increase over the previous fiscal year. The increase 
rate sharply dropped compared with (a 41.1 percent increase) in 
fiscal 1992. Both Honda Motor Co., and Mitsubishi Motors 
Corporation purchased more U.S. parts in fiscal 1993 than in the 
previous year. However, the purchase of U.S. parts by Japanese 
automakers as a whole increased slightly in fiscal 1993 due to a 
drop in exports and a slump in domestic sales. 
  It is expected that major automakers' local procurement of 
U.S. parts in the United States will increase steadily in fiscal 
1994, the final year of the voluntary plans. This is because 
Toyota started operations at its second plant in Kentucky in 
March and because Nissan intends to start full-fledged operation 
of its plants to produce 450,000 cars annually in the United 
States. However, since small automakers are still facing a 
tough situation, it is observed that "it is difficult for them 
to increase purchases of U.S. parts to more than $3 billion in 
total during one year," (according to an executive of a major 
automaker). 
  During U.S. President Bush's visit to Japan in 1992, the 
Japanese automobile industry announced that it would target a 
goal of $19 billion for its purchase of U.S. auto parts for 
fiscal 1994." Based on the goal, each automaker separately 
spelled out this March a purchasing plan for fiscal 1996 and 
1997. Because the U.S. Government has demanded further increase 
in Japanese automakers' purchase of U.S.-made parts, a delay in 
their purchasing plan due to a slump in the Japanese automotive 
market will likely have a delicate influence on future 
negotiations between Japan and the United States.

  [Text] Commenting on negotiations on the automobile and 
auto parts sector under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] stated on 20 June: "We cannot make any 
concessions on the point on which we cannot compromise in 
principle." Thus, the official stressed Japan's stand that it 
will not make easy concessions in final consultations on the 
sector, which will start on 24 June to prepare for the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks prior to the July Naples summit (meeting 
of leaders of the seven industrialized nations). 
  It is believed that he reiterated Japan's stance of not 
accepting anything like numerical targets.

  [Text] The government will ask the United States and South 
Korea to take concerted steps with Japan to bring North Korea's 
past developments in the nuclear field to light, a government 
source disclosed on 20 June. The government has decided to do 
so in response to the prospect of the resumption of high-level 
U.S.-DPRK talks and the DPRK's proposal to hold North-South 
summit talks. The government intends to speedily set 
itineraries for Prime Minister Hata to visit South Korea and 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa to visit the United States. They will 
seek to shape a consensus with the United States and South Korea 
in dealing with the issue of the past developments in North 
Korea's nuclear program. 
  With regard to the DPRK nuclear issue, the United States has 
set as a condition of the resumption of the stalled U.S.-North 
Korean high-level talks the DPRK's acceptance of special 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to 
determine whether Pyongyang has in the past diverted plutonium 
to build nuclear weapons. During his meeting with former U.S. 
President Carter, North Korean President Kim Il-song said that 
as conditions for resuming the stalled U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks, the DPRK will allow IAEA inspectors to remain 
at the North's nuclear facilities and that North Korea will 
return completely to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  In response, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci 
indicated that the U.S. Government would accept the proposal put 
forward by the DPRK president for resuming the high-level talks, 
saying, "If North Korea is found to have promised to freeze 
major elements of its nuclear program when we pursue another 
round of high-level talks between the United States and North 
Korea, this would be a constructive step." In this way, the 
United States has softened its preconditions for resuming the 
stalled U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. 
  The IAEA has said that following North Korea's complete 
removal of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor, it is 
be unable to verify developments in the DPRK's nuclear program. 
The same government source said, "The U.S. Government intends 
to leave the issue of verifying past developments of North 
Korea's nuclear program to the North-South summit talks, in 
anticipation of the impossibility of verifying them."

<F P=106> [Article by Seoul correspondent Toshihiro Ishihara; third in </F>
a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected 
Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the 
International Community": "Irritated South Korea Concerned by 
the Possibility of Sanctions Provoking Military Clashes"] 
  [Text] ROK President Kim Yong-sam called a meeting of the 
National Security Council to discuss North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons. During the meeting, the South 
Korean president stated with a grim expression on his face, 
"North Korea's nuclear program is targeting us, and we have to 
keep the DPRK from developing nuclear weapons by all means." 
This was the first such meeting that the president had called 
since taking office. 
  Commenting on the North Korean nuclear issue, South Koreans 
have said: "The DPRK's nuclear program is putting 70 million 
Koreans both in the North and South at risk. The DPRK's nuclear 
program is a fragrant violation of the joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." South Koreans 
consider the North's nuclear program to be a major obstacle to 
maintaining peace and stability in Asia. Many South Koreans 
believe that "if North Korea has nuclear arms, Japan will arm 
itself with nuclear arms." 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song has repeatedly stated: 
"We 
have neither the capability to develop nuclear weapons nor the 
intention of doing so. We do not need nuclear weapons." The 
DPRK declared last March that it would leave the nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty (NPT) after rejecting special inspections 
of facilities that were suspected of being used to develop 
nuclear weapons. On 13 June, North Korea announced its 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
further deepening suspicions about its development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The ROK has called on North Korea to settle the nuclear 
issue 
based on the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula on which the two Koreas agreed in December 
1991. In line with the joint declaration, the two Koreas set up 
the North-South Joint Committee on Nuclear Management to conduct 
mutual nuclear inspections in addition to nuclear inspections by 
the IAEA, but the joint committee has remained stalled since 
January 1993, when meetings broke off after the two Koreas 
failed to find areas of agreement to carry out the mutual 
nuclear inspections. 
  Inter-Korea prime ministerial talks were scheduled to be 
held 
in Seoul in December 1992, but North Korea unilaterally called 
them off. Working-level talks have been held since last October 
to discuss an exchange of envoys to make arrangements for 
North-South summit talks. At one point, there existed the mood 
at a meeting to reach an agreement on an exchange of envoys. At 
the eighth round of the working-level meetings in March, South 
Korea asserted that the North Korean nuclear issue should be 
resolved as a matter of priority. In reacting against the ROK's 
assertion, the DPRK broke off the meeting after saying, "Seoul 
will be turned into a sea of fire." Since then, North and South 
Korea have had no channel for dialogue. 
  The DPRK has made it clear that the United States is its 
sole 
counterpart for discussing the nuclear issue, in showing no 
willingness to hold a dialogue with South Korea. This stand by 
North Korea has irritated the South. The resumption of the 
North-South dialogue is a precondition for holding high-level 
U.S.-DPRK talks. The condition for resuming the North-South 
dialogue was dropped because the issue of holding the third 
round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks encountered rough sailing. 
  Whenever the question has been raised about imposing 
sanctions on the North since it announced its withdrawal from 
the NPT, the ROK has persuaded the nations involved to take 
"mild measures against North Korea." The ROK has been concerned 
that hard-line measures such as sanctions could incite North 
Korea to provoke military clashes on the Korean peninsula. 
  Experts on the Korean peninsula point out that debates in 
the 
UN Security Council on sanctions against the DPRK mean another 
"crisis" on the Korean peninsula, following the crisis that 
arose from an attempt by North Korean commandos to attack 
Chongwadae (the presidential office) following the end of the 
1950-53 Korean war. 
  South Korea has made one concession after another to North 
Korea in a bid to prevent a recurrence of the past tragedy, but 
the DPRK nuclear issue has been aggravated. South Korea, a 
counterpart of North Korea, has been unable to talk directly to 
North Korea about the nuclear issue. The ROK strongly believes 
that the only way to have North Korea change its stand is to 
push for UN sanctions in concert with Japan and the United 
States while seeking cooperation from Russia and China. 
  On 15 June, former U.S. President Carter entered North Korea 
through Panmunjom. South Koreans are now watching intently to 
see what results his trip to North Korea will bring about.

Streamline and Integrate U.S. Military Bases on Okinawa": 
"Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield -- The Full Return of the Airfield 
Is Under Study"] 
  [Text] The return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield hinges 
largely on how to resolve a radio wave obstacle problem at the 
Sube Communications Station operated by the U.S. Navy. The 
Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed on 16 June to set up a task 
force mandated to discuss ways to return the airfield. The task 
force will begin studying technical ways to resolve the radio 
wave obstacle problem. U.S. forces in Okinawa have already 
assigned experts to do research on the relocation of the 
communications station. 
  The question is where the current parachute training ground 
should be relocated from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. U.S. 
forces in Okinawa have often conducted parachute training on Ie 
Island. U.S. forces in Okinawa have said: "The parachute 
training ground on Ie Island is located near coastal areas and 
paratroopers are in danger of losing their lives if they land in 
the water. We have to ferry our paratroopers to the island the 
day before parachute training is conducted on the island and 
preposition rescue boats in waters near the parachute training 
ground. We have to spend a lot of time and money to conduct 
parachute training on the island." In this way, U.S. forces in 
Okinawa think it improper to relocate the parachute training 
ground from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield to Ie Island. 
  Chubu Training Ground at Camp Hansen, which is located 
between Kin Town and Ginoza Village, is being mentioned as a 
potential site for the relocation. 
  U.S. forces in Okinawa use Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield not 
only as a ground for parachute training, but as a radio wage 
buffer area for the Sube Communications Station. The 
communications station is managed by a U.S. naval communications 
security group assigned to the Naval Communications Security 
Group Command (NSGC). U.S. forces in Okinawa call the 
communications station Hanza base. 
  The communications station is part of the global U.S. 
communications network. The station intercepts foreign 
communications and secret codes in the Asian region and sends 
them back to the NSGC in Washington D.C. after decoding them. 
  According to an American serviceman, economic activities are 
expected to be brisk as one building after another is 
constructed near the communications station and U.S. forces in 
Okinawa are concerned that such buildings would obstruct the 
smooth operation of the communications station. According to the 
same American serviceman, a group of American electronics 
engineers are looking for an alternative site on the premise of 
relocating the communications station. 
  If the parachute training ground is relocated from Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield, then the Sube Communications Station would 
have to be relocated. There is a high possibility that their 
relocations could abruptly lead to a full return of the Yomitan 
Auxiliary Airfield. It is said that plans worked out by U.S. 
forces to resolve problems facing the communications station 
definitely indicate the possibility of fully returning the 
communications station. The biggest task will be the technical 
study of how to relocate the communication station and the study 
of how to persuade Okinawans residing in an area where the 
communications station is relocated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report; last part of three-part series </F>
entitled: "Moves Are Afoot To Streamline and Integrate U.S. 
Military Bases on Okinawa": "Live Shell-Firing Exercises"] 
  [Text] The U.S. forces are currently studying a plan to 
remove almost all functions of a training area on Okinawa, where 
firing trainings are conducted across Highway 104, to the 
Higashifuji Training Area in Shizuoka Prefecture. However, as 
the U.S. forces have asserted, the plan is being considered on 
the condition that Japan bear the cost for transferring troops 
from Okinawa to Shizuoka. Under the current Japanese-U.S. 
status of forces agreement, it is impossible for Japan to give 
direct support to the U.S. forces in transferring combat troops. 
The United States, however, is calling for the conclusion of a 
new, special agreement, thus indicating its strong desire to 
remove the functions of the training area to another site. 
  Lieutenant General Henry C. Stackpole, who commands all U.S. 
Marine deployed in the Pacific, recently met with Okinawa 
Governor Masahide Ota, who is currently on a visit to the United 
States. He clearly said to the governor: "Although it is 
difficult to abolish everything, military exercises on Okinawa 
will be reduced in number as early as next year." Stackpole 
made the remark prior to the start of negotiations between Tokyo 
and Washington on the costs for transferring troops. However, 
he was not clear about whether what he said implied his 
expectation that Japan and the United States would reach an 
agreement next year on the removal of the firing range area to 
another site or that he just meant a decrease in the number of 
live shell-firing exercises. 
  It was Lt. Gen. Stackpole who first proposed the plan to 
transfer the functions of the training area on Okinawa to 
Higashifuji. He disclosed this as his private plan at a news 
conference held after his speech in Naha in March of last year. 
At a later date (in July of last year), he granted an interview 
to the OKINAWA TIMES at Camp Smith in Hawaii, which is the 
headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command. During the interview, 
he said: "We plan to transfer troops by air and to transport 
weapons by sea for live shell-firing exercises to be conducted 
at Higashifuji for two weeks to six months. We intend to ask 
the Japanese Government to bear the expenses." 
  The U.S. Marine Corps calculates that the cost of one 
transfer is approximately $1 million (about 100 million yen). 
  There are U.S.-owned barracks in the Higashifuji Training 
Area, so technically speaking, it is not difficult to carry out 
exercises there. Thus, compliance by the Japanese Government 
with the U.S. call to bear the costs holds the key to removing 
the functions of the firing range area on Okinawa to another 
site. 
  It is predicted that citizens living near the Higashifuji 
Training Area will oppose firing practices there. The 
government is being urged to decide on whether it should agree 
to bear the costs, and on how it should deal with the citizens 
near Higashifuji. 
  U.S. military bases on Okinawa have become larger in size 
through the U.S. occupation of the island and forcible land 
expropriation. There is an opinion in Okinawa that the 
government's active participation is imperative to resolving the 
bases issue, which has remained unsolved for half a century 
since the end of the Pacific war. Meanwhile, a difficult task 
remains undone -- coordinating the opinions of Okinawans to make 
progress on the bases issue.

  [Text] European carmakers such as Mercedes Benz and BMW 
have set up low-interest loans one after the other and begun a 
sales offensive in the Japanese market. U.S. autos already have 
introduced "low-priced cars" with a low list price, but in the 
case of European cars which are luxury class autos, it appears 
that, because of the necessity to maintain brand image, they 
have entered the "low price battlefront" by lowering loan 
interest rates which has little effect on the list price. With 
the bonus season drawing close, domestic car dealers have a 
heightened sense of wariness about intensification of price 
competition. 
  BMW (BMW Japan, Chiba city), the import base for BMW cars, 
announced on 3 June that it would extend until the end of August 
the special 2.9-percent loans that it had implemented until the 
end of May. The whole series was considered subject to it up 
until the end of May, but the extension will narrow the car 
class to the middle-class "5 series." In the case of the "5201 
Sedan" (4.95 million yen), the total price will be over 305,000 
yen cheaper (60 payments) compared to the regular loan (6.5 
percent). 
  Moreover, Mercedes Benz Japan (Minato Ward, Tokyo), the 
import base for Benz cars, has introduced a 3.5-percent loan 
beginning this month until the end of July targeting its highest 
car class, "S class." In the case of borrowing 11 million yen, 
total payments will be 825,000 yen less than a regular loan (6.5 
percent). 
  In addition, it will set up special loans until the end of 
July for the Audi and through June for the Rover (Mini). 
  Many of the European auto low-interest loans adopt the 
method 
of a maker-affiliated finance company paying the trade account 
receivable for the sales office at the time of the purchase 
contract and receiving repayment from the purchasing customer 
later. The import bases which are the Japanese subsidiaries of 
European makers consider that, "while bound by sales policy, 
they will set up low-interest loans for limited car classes and 
periods," (BMW Japan) and it is a so-called maker (import base) 
initiated "discount." 
  As opposed to this, the sales offices of many domestic cars 
finance the purchasing customer. For this reason, even though 
the car price is discounted, there is the aspect of trying to 
improve profit by financing, and interest has become high.

<F P=106> [Interview with ROK Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong by an </F>
unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] Although the South Korean economy was in the 
doldrums in recent years because of weak domestic demand, 
increased capital investment and other factors are accelerating 
the pace of economic recovery. South Korea's real gross 
national product (GNP) increased to 8.8 percent in the 
January-March 1994 period (compared to the corresponding period 
of 1993), which is the highest growth since the April-June 1991 
period. Now, some people express anxiety about the possibility 
that the economy might overheat and inflation would surge. On 
the other hand, South Korea is urged to open and liberalize its 
markets in connection with its bid to become a member of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 
1996. NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN recently interviewed ROK Finance 
Minister Hong Chae-hyong on the current state of the South 
Korean economy and its prospects. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the current state of the 
economy? 
  [Hong] The South Korean economy hit the bottom in January 
1993. Since then it has been reviving. It is continuing its 
growth this year as well. Such sectors as production, exports, 
and investment are all expanding. The annual economic growth in 
1994 will be about 7.5 to 8 percent. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think the economy is in 
danger of overheating? 
  [Hong] An 8-percent economic growth may be too high for a 
single year. But because we registered low growth in 1992 and 
1993, I think the figure is appropriate. Although some are 
worried about possible overheating of the economy because of a 
high production- line operating rate in the manufacturing 
industry, there are no signs of the economy overheating. It is 
not time for the government to adopt a policy to slow down the 
economic recovery. We will administer economic affairs in such 
a way that the nation can maintain a stable economic growth. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What about price behavior? 
  [Hong] I believe the government can achieve its goal of 
pushing up consumer prices by 6 percent. But it has to steer 
economic affairs while being mindful of next year's consumer 
prices. We must observe price behavior with the greatest 
interest. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Last year, your country earned a 
surplus on the current account balance of payments for the first 
time in four years. But because of increased imports in the 
process of economic recovery, it has again shown a downward 
trend. 
  [Hong] Although exports are steadily growing, an increase in 
imports exceeds it due to the expanding import of capital goods. 
Imports will continue to increase because of the economic 
recovery. But if an increase in the import of capital goods 
leads to an increase in exports, this year's current account 
balance of payments will be in balance. Or it will close with a 
small deficit of about $1 billion or $1.5 billion. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] South Korea plans to become an OECD 
member in late 1996. 
  [Hong] The objective is for the country to play its role and 
assume its responsibility in the international community, now 
that the South Korean economy has grown. OECD membership will 
help improve ROK's position in the international community and 
enable the country to actively participate in creating a world's 
economic order. Seoul has promoted the internationalization of 
its economy and the opening up of its markets. In the financial 
sector, it has been implementing the phased deregulation of 
interest rates and the open market plan. I think conditions for 
South Korea to become an OECD member have gradually been created. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is said that South Korean 
financial institutions are less competitive compared to those in 
developed nations. Do you not think they will face business 
difficulties if the market is liberalized? 
  [Hong] That is possible. Even now, competition among South 
Korean financial institutions is very severe. But if the market 
is liberalized, customers will be offered better service. You 
cannot stop moves toward opening the market. It is possible 
that competition among banks will promote streamlining of 
management and lead to lowered interest rates. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Expanding direct foreign investment 
is also a major task for your country. 
  [Hong] On 10 June, the government compiled measures to 
promote foreign capital inflow. They include easing regulations 
concerning foreign affiliates' lending funds from foreign firms, 
and simplifying investment procedures. I hope 
technology-intensive industries will invest in our country. 
These measures will be effective in facilitating industries' 
structural reform and speeding up business ties between South 
Korean enterprises and foreign companies. I strongly hope 
Japanese parts makers will make inroads into the South Korean 
markets.

  [Text] The import of semiconductors from South Korea and 
Taiwan is rapidly increasing. According to trade statistics of 
the Ministry of Finance, the amount of memory imports from 
January to April 1994 was 36.7 billion yen or 3.3 times the same 
period of the previous year for Korean-made chips and 3.1 
billion yen or 8.6 times the same period of the previous year 
for Taiwan-made chips. The high yen and recovery of domestic 
demand is behind the rapid increase in imports. On the other 
hand, with the favorable trend of U.S. personal computer 
shipments, exports to the United States are progressing steadily 
at 95.1 billion yen, a 26.5-percent increase over the same 
period of the previous year, and amplified the sense of a 
product shortage in the domestic market. It seems that the 
influx of Korean and Taiwan imports will continue in the future 
also. 
  The core of imports from South Korea is 4-megabit DRAM 
(dynamic random access memory), which are procured by 
information communications instrument makers and personal 
computer peripheral makers who produce extended memory boards 
for the United States. Imports of mask ROM (read-only memory) 
used in game machines have also been increasing since around 
last year. 
  Many of the Taiwan products are mask ROM and EPROM 
(erasable, 
programmable ROM) used in OA [office automation] machines. The 
fact that "the quality of Taiwan-made semiconductors is steadily 
rising" (electrical machinery manufacturer) has been cited as a 
primary factor for the increase in imports. 
  Driven by the increased production of memory for personal 
computers for the United States, a shortage is continuing for 
various kinds of memory in the domestic market, including DRAM. 
Actually, the BB ratio (ratio of amount of orders received to 
amount of shipments) of the U.S. semiconductor market in April 
was on a high level of 1.14. 
  The amount of memory needed due to the strengthened 
functions 
of personal computer software is increasing, and major domestic 
semiconductor manufacturers just about agree with the view that 
"at least the U.S. memory demand will progress vigorously within 
the year."

  [Text] The three companies of Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor, 
and Isuzu Motors have agreed in principle to supply each other 
with diesel engine parts in Thailand. They are filling in the 
details and soon will sign an agreement. The Thai Government has 
set forth an auto policy to boost the domestic production rate 
for diesel engine parts to 70 percent (currently 50 percent) by 
June 1996. Because each of the three companies has local 
production bases, they will divide labor in production of engine 
parts, effectively using each others' facilities and aiming to 
achieve the domestic production rate within a short period while 
pursuing merit of scale. 
  The target will be diesel engine parts for one-ton pickup 
trucks (including for export) that they each produce locally in 
Thailand. 
  Toyota has built a casting plant for engine manufacture in 
the outskirts of Bangkok with "Siam Toyota Manufacturing," a 
joint venture with Siam Cement Group, a large Thai conglomerate, 
as the nucleus, and soon will put it in operation. The local 
sales companies of Nissan and Isuzu have also inaugurated 
"Naharoha Industries," a joint investment with Siam Naharoha 
Foundry, a casting parts company of the Siam Cement Group, and 
have a casting factory in the outskirts of Bangkok. 
  Siam Toyota will supply block castings to Nissan and Isuzu, 
and Naharoha Industries is studying in the direction of 
supplying Toyota with head parts and crankshafts. 
  The Thai Investment Committee (BOI) is obligated to boost 
the 
domestic rate for diesel engine parts from the current 50 
percent to 60 percent by fiscal 1994 (July 1994 to June 1995), 
and to 70 percent during fiscal 1995 (July 1995 to June 1996).

  [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), 
Sumitomo Corporation, Itohchu, and two Indonesian firms will 
form a consortium to place a bid in the international bidding 
process for Indonesian telecommunications projects. The project 
will involve the installation of 2 million circuits and the 
minimum investment value is expected to be $2 billion. The 
project will be handled under the build, operate, and transfer 
(BOT) format involving the construction of facilities, recovery 
of costs after operating the system for a given period, and 
transfer of the system to local personnel. The three Japanese 
firms have reached the assessment that the telecommunications 
market in Indonesia will expand rapidly along with economic 
growth and hope to participate in such prospects. NTT has been 
designated a domestic telecommunications operator, but it has 
stated that it will not be subject to regulation in connection 
with the proposed projects because it is limited to the 
Indonesian domestic market. 
  The three Japanese firms including NTT will form a five-firm 
consortium with an Indonesian corporate giant called Salim Group 
and one more local firm, which plans to submit papers to the 
Indonesian Government at the end of June to qualify for the 
bidding process. The qualifications screening process will 
designate about 10 qualifying consortia, which will be asked to 
submit formal bids. Results of the bidding process will be 
announced at the end of the year or in early 1995. It appears 
the Indonesian Government will divide the area to be covered by 
the new system into four or five areas, each to be handled by a 
separate group designated to handle a maximum of 500,000 
circuits. 
  Under the five-year telecommunications construction program, 
a total of 5 million new circuits are to be installed, but it 
was decided that the Indonesian National Telephone Company would 
not be able to handle the entire project, leading to the 
decision to subject 2 million circuits to bidding by foreign 
firms. 
  Under the BOT format, consortia with winning bids handle the 
planning, construction, management, and maintenance of installed 
systems. Since the new projects will make partial use of 
existing telecommunications networks, consortia with winning 
bids will split revenue, such as that for telephone calls, with 
the Indonesian National Telephone Company. The share for the 
consortia will be 70 percent. 
  It appears that European and U.S. telecommunications firms 
will submit bids, but it is expected that Japanese-affiliated 
consortia are favored to win bids. The reasons for such an 
outlook are that Japanese-made switching systems are widely used 
and Japan commands a technical advantage, while the Indonesian 
Government is expected to seek funds from the Japan 
Export-Import Bank in the form of loans to install 
telecommunications circuits.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Expanding the Playing Field of the `Advanced </F>
Nations Club"] 
  [Text] Is it an exaggeration to say that "the boundaries 
between East and West and North and South have vanished?" The 
East Asian nations are undergoing spectacular economic growth. 
The wave of market economies is now pushing onto the shores of 
former socialist nations. The economies of advanced nations have 
been withering and distinctions from energetic developing 
nations are becoming vague. 
  The question now is how will advanced nations transform 
themselves in the world economy which has been significantly 
changed after the Cold War, and what sort of order will they 
establish? The theme discussed at the cabinet-level directors 
meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) in Paris concentrated on this one point. 
  The joint statement of the cabinet-level directors meeting 
gave the impression that difficulties will be encountered in the 
solution of issues spreading on a global scale such as 
unemployment and environmental pollution. However, some progress 
was manifested in the formulation of a major policy statement 
concerning a new global economic order. 
  Unlike last year, when the world was struck by widespread 
recession, this year's global economy is enjoying a fledgling 
recovery. The U.S. economic expansion is being accompanied by a 
widening economic bottoming out in Europe. The OECD 
Secretariat's revision of the outlook for growth in member 
nations as a whole for this year--from 2.1 percent predicted at 
the end of last year to 2.6 percent--in itself provides support 
to the brightening prospects. 
  It is only natural that the concerns of the respective 
nations shifted from near-term economic measures to chronic 
unemployment of increasing intensity. The joint statement 
states, "Unemployment represents a waste of potential human 
capabilities and is a threat to the unity of society." 
  There is no disagreement in the perception that solution of 
the unemployment issue requires not only economic measures, but 
an indispensable structural reform of the economy. The problem 
is whether such actions are feasible. 
  Chronic unemployment in European nations emanates from an 
unemployment system which provides for generous jobless 
insurance benefits, extended payment periods, and the capability 
to survive somehow without acquiring a stable job. Such 
practices are a cause for inflating the fiscal deficits of 
concerned nations. However, it is not easy to convince the 
public of the need to reduce payments and conserve in the area 
of welfare. 
  The unemployed in OECD nations as a whole total 35 million 
because they have lost their jobs owing to an onslaught of cheap 
industrial products flowing in from developing nations and East 
European countries. The view has been voiced in Europe and the 
United States that imports should be banned from developing 
nations where environmental regulations are lax and labor 
conditions are inferior. However, we should not embrace 
protective trade practices which split the world economy in two. 
  OECD strategy calls for the import of developing nation 
products on the one hand while implementing deregulation and 
technological reform on the other hand to increase employment 
through the creation of new markets which do not compete with 
developing nation products. This represents sound logic, but 
regretfully we still lack new investment sectors which lead to 
significant increases in employment. We should probably face the 
reality that it will take time for advanced nations to recover 
economic vitality. 
  In that respect, we can appreciate the OECD position of 
withdrawing from the erstwhile "club of advanced nations" and 
seeking other means for expanding its economic activities. This 
month's affiliation of Mexico has been followed by preparations 
by South Korea and four East European nations to join the OECD. 
Aside from signing an economic cooperative agreement with 
Russia, it is actively pursuing dialogue with China and Central 
and South American nations. 
  The OECD has assumed a new role in which it strives for 
equalization of competitive conditions by establishing mutual 
affinity for working conditions and environmental standards with 
newly industrialized nations and former Eastern bloc nations as 
well as advanced nations. 
  Although the excuse given was the preoccupation with Diet 
budget deliberations, it is regrettable that not even a single 
Japanese cabinet member attended the OECD conference. It was an 
exceptional opportunity for Japan to demonstrate its resolve to 
expand domestic demand, just when European and U.S. attention is 
focused on Japan's lagging economic recovery and growing current 
accounts surplus. 
  The Naples summit of principal world leaders will be next. 
We 
would like Japan to awaken to its grave role in formulating a 
new world economic order and to spare no effort in preparing for 
the summit.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan's Long Absence in International </F>
Economics"] 
  [Text] The cabinet-level directors meetings of the 
Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) are 
normally forums for preparing the agenda for advanced nation 
summit conferences, but the recent meeting was in a sense a 
milestone for the global economic system in the post-Cold War 
era. 
  The cabinet-level directors meeting agreed to handle the 
employment issue, which is a common concern of advanced nations 
from both a macroeconomic policy and structural policy. 
Structural unemployment cannot be resolved merely by relying on 
the stimulation of demand based on macroeconomic policies; and a 
change in the structural situation leading to the creation of 
jobs by attempting to resolve the problem by structural 
policies, in disregard of macro policies, cannot be expected. 
There is significance in the cabinet-level directors statement 
that emphasizes the synergistic effects of these two policies. 
  The cabinet-level directors meeting confirmed the launching 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 1995 and 
discussed, from the standpoint of advanced nations, the 
framework for the next bilateral trade negotiations to include 
trade and the environment, trade and labor standards, and trade 
and investment. The meeting also resulted in an agreement to 
support the membership of South Korea and former East European 
nations and to intensify affiliations with nations of other 
spheres such as China and Russia. 
  A regrettable aspect was that Japanese cabinet members were 
not present for this valuable international economic conference. 
It might have been permissible to limit attendance to 
bureaucrats if we were speaking of a common international 
conference, but since not a single cabinet member attended the 
cabinet-level conference, we probably cannot say that we were in 
attendance at the gathering. In comparison with other advanced 
nations who dispatched several principal economic cabinet 
members, we must say that Japan's presence was hardly noticeable. 
  This is not an issue of pure formality on the question of 
whether or not a nation should attend a conference. The problem 
here is that the situation is reflective of Japan's posture 
concerning global economic systems. 
  Japan has always been criticized for its passive posture. 
The 
recent OECD cabinet-level directors meeting included a request 
that Japan expand its domestic demand and reduce its current 
account surpluses. Japan always exercises concern over the 
intensity of demands lodged with Japan, but it is Japan's option 
to expand domestic demand and reduce its surpluses. 
  Recently, Japan has outdone itself with respect to such 
passive postures and has a tendency of isolating itself. At the 
Uruguay Round of talks where an agreement was reached on trade 
systems for the post-Cold War period, Japan was expected to take 
a leading role as foremost benefitting nation, but once the 
talks were finished, Japan relegated itself to playing the role 
of the persecuted. At the employment summit held in the United 
States which was attended by all of the principal economic 
cabinet members of the participating nations, Japan was 
represented by only the labor minister, giving the Japanese 
delegation an inferiority complex. Then, finally, the OECD 
cabinet-level directors meeting was held. 
  The post-Cold War global economy is being affected by an 
upheaval of an unprecedented scale. Nations that were in a 
developing stage not too long ago have acquired manufacturing 
capabilities of a level equal to those of advanced nations and 
have launched an offensive against world markets, taking 
advantage of low labor rates. That situation underlies the 
unemployment issue in advanced nations. 
  It is of extreme importance to consider the formulation of a 
new global economic framework without lapsing into 
protectionism. The respective nations will no doubt listen to 
any proposals that Japan might have as a nation with the dual 
position of a foothold in Asia and as an advanced nation. 
  Japan's absence from the global economic system has been too 
long. Not only is such a stance contrary to Japan's national 
interests, but runs the risk of posing an obstacle to the 
balanced management of the world economy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article in three installments: "A Patchwork </F>
Regime--the Deepening Fluidity in the Political World"] 
<H5>  [23 Apr 94 p 36] </H5>
  [Text] A week has passed since Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa suddenly expressed his desire to resign. The "deepening 
fluidity" in the political world touched off over whom to select 
as his successor has subsided for the time being through the 
birth of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. However, the signs of 
dissolution of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] facing the danger of 
split have not disappeared. Our present regime is like a 
patchwork in which pieces of cloth are coercively stitched 
together. Thread frays show horribly, and tears and rips are 
likely to appear here and there before long. The following is a 
report on the present political world pivoting around the new 
regime. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa again did not 
appear. The time was 1500 on 22 April. The place was a large 
lecture hall on the fifth floor of the No. 1 Annex to the lower 
house. A press conference was held there to announce the 
decision to support Mr. Hata. Seated on a chair reserved for Mr. 
Ozawa was Secretary Moriyoshi Sato. He was there in place of Mr. 
Ozawa. He said: "I was in a sauna bath when there was a sudden 
call asking me to `be here because Mr. Ozawa needs a member to 
accompany him.' Why is it I who should be here?" 
  A very similar scene was also seen at a press conference 
held 
in June 1993 at Akasaka Prince Hotel to announce the start of 
Shinseito. Mr. Ozawa hammers out policies while Mr. Hata, who is 
good at putting up a front, is used for performances. This 
Shinseito strategy is seen transparently through these events. 
  "Among Japanese politicians, on whom should we rely?" asked 
James Foster, councilor in charge of economic affairs in the 
U.S. Embassy, when he was visiting the office of former Deputy 
Prime Minister and Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda in the 
Members' Office Building of the lower house at 1600 on 3 April 
after the Japanese-U.S. summit talks were broken off. Former 
Justicie Minister Gotoda answered immediately that "it would be 
Ozawa." Mr. Foster responded with a nod, saying that "that is 
also what I have thought." 
  It is becoming a matter of common knowledge that the United 
States intends to make Mr. Ozawa the contact for 
behind-the-scenes negotiations. 
  Over the automobile issue which is said to symbolize 
Japan-U.S. economic friction, it is said that Mr. Ozawa is 
continuing negotiations below the surface of the water, using 
transport bureaucrats. According to a person concerned, talks 
are frequently held between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mondale and 
Mr. Ozawa. 
  There is a person who foresaw close Hata-Ozawa relations a 
fairly long time ago. 
  On the afternoon of 20 March 1992, about 30 people concerned 
with the political world crowded into a sickroom of Showa 
University Hospital. The sickroom was filled to overflowing, and 
the visitors even crowded the hallway. At bedside was Mr. Hata 
who kept placing his hand on the left breast of a man lying in 
his sickbed. At 1555, Mr. Hata confirmed the cessation of the 
man's heartbeat. 
  The man was Mr. Takashi Yamasaki (then 61). He served two 
generations of the Hata family--Mr. Hata and his father, the 
late Bushiro Hata--for over 30 years. A person close to Mr. 
Yamasaki says: "Yamasaki handled every minor detail in the Hata 
office. I think that, but for him, there would never be today's 
Hata." He worked as chairman of the Society of Secretaries 
belonging to the Tanaka faction's Mokuyo Club and the Takeshita 
faction's Keiseikai. He was a secretary of great caliber who is 
said to have often managed elections for entire factions. 
  During his lifetime, Mr. Yamasaki used to tell his friends 
that "it is my dream to make Hata a prime minister." However, 
when questioned, "Do you really think he will be able to become 
prime minister?" he is said to have replied: "I might be 
expecting too much. He might be a lower house speaker type." As 
to Mr. Ozawa, he used to say that "he is a man with terrible 
guts." 
  However, there is also a possibility that the relationship 
of 
the two may suffer a subtle change through Hata's assumption of 
the office of prime minister. 
  At a session of the upper house Budget Committee on 10 
December 1992, the face of Mr. Hata, who kept answering 
questions with a gentle look, suddenly flushed. 
  This happened when Mr. Yoshinori Yoshioka (Japan Communist 
Party [JCP]) queried him about Mr. Ozawa, saying that Ozawa had 
a hand in secret talks of the GATT's new multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round) on opening the rice market. Mr. 
Hata stressed the difference of views between the two, saying "I 
wonder why Mr. Ozawa met with someone like that and how he could 
have useful talks." 
  Hata himself once said that "Ozawa is a scriptwriter and I 
am 
an actor." However, he recently confided to his close friend: 
"In fact, we do not meet each other very often. We are both 
busy." 
  Dogged always by the shadow of Mr. Ozawa, the Hosokawa 
cabinet was criticized as a "regime with a deepening dual 
structure." What path will the Hata cabinet choose? 
<H5>  [24 Apr 94 p 23] </H5>
  [Text] "All were well-worn bills tied up in a bundle with 
rubber bands. We received them twice--10 million yen each time." 
This is what a secretary to a freshman Diet member who received 
monetary assistance from the party in the July 1993 general 
election confided to people close to him. Needless to say, the 
head of Shinseito is Tsutomu Hata. 
  At a session of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on 
Political 
Reform held on 5 November 1993, Hidekatsu Yoshii (JCP), a 
committee member, asked: "You are surely saying that no other 
than officially approved expenses (5 million yen) were handed, 
are you not?" 
  "Yes, I am," answered [then] Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Hata. 
  Shinseito had announced that it pegged on its own the 
officially approved expenses at 5 million yen. Testimony by 
candidates' secretaries indicated that, other than this amount, 
there were also 15 million yen of election funds. The party had 
69 candidates. Yoshii, the committee member, queried further, 
asking: "The total comes up to more than 1 billion yen (at an 
offhand estimate). What is the source of the funds?" Mr. Hata 
wholly denied his allegations. 
  Now that he has become the prime minister, he will 
undoubtedly be asked to explain one more time on this issue. 
  "Hata B"... 
  In March 1993, MAINICHI SHIMBUN obtained a list of 
politicians receiving contributions from Shimizu Corp., a major 
general construction firm (general contractor), and Hata's name 
was on the list. Recipients of 10 million yen belonging to the 
highest SA [special A] rank were only former LDP Vice President 
Shin Kanemaru and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Among 
those listed in the A rank deserving of 5 million yen were 
former Prime Ministers Kiichi Miyazawa and Yasuhiro Nakasone 
and, along with them, Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. 
  Those belonging to the B rank like Hata were listed as 3 
million yen recipients. A Hata aide said that "the issue would 
be investigated" when the list was made public, but no reply has 
yet been made. 
<H5>  General Contractors' Contributions to Hata and Ozawa </H5>
Shrouded in Mystery 
  Monetary scandals related to Mr. Hata have not surfaced 
despite his past affiliations with the LDP's Tanaka faction and 
Keiseikai, which could not rid themselves of the collusion 
between money and politics. However, we see a sign that the 
LDP's zoku Dietmen system, which has been called the hotbed of 
the party's collusion with business circles, is even reviving 
within Shinseito which has grabbed power [zoku--a group of Diet 
members who exercise in a particular field policymaking 
expertise and contacts generally acquired through service as 
chairman or vice chairman of the appropriate party policy 
deliberation committee]. 
  Early this year when the Special Investigation Department of 
the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office was conducting its 
final probe into the involvement of the political world as part 
of the so-called general contractor graft scandal, the 
department summoned former leaders and executives of Hazama 
Corp. (main office at Minato ward, Tokyo) to hear their 
testimonies in strict secrecy. 
  They were summoned because among data confiscated by the 
Special Investigation Department from the Hazama main office 
were records indicating that an amount of 10 million yen was 
disbursed to Mr. Ozawa's camp in the middle of December 1991. 
Ozawa's camp totally denies receiving the contribution. In 
addition, it was also discovered that Ozawa had received a 
donation of 5 million yen from Kajima Corp. At a press 
conference on 8 November 1993, answering a question if the 
donation did not conflict with the Regulation of Money for 
Political Activities Act, he simply said that "the donation was 
handled legitimately" and did not mention a bit about the way 
the donation was dealt with, saying that "it is not legally 
asked" to specify handling methods. 
  Shinseito lower house member Toshihiro Nikai is said to be 
Ozawa's confidant. In the "National Association of Tourist 
Organizations" (Minato ward, Tokyo) made up of 5,200 
medium-sized and small tourist companies, you will see calendars 
carrying a big picture of Mr. Nikai hung up in every quarter. 
  When Mr. Nikai became parliamentary vice minister for 
transport in August 1993, he resigned as chairman of the 
association. However, he recently became the association's 
"honorary chairman" on 18 April. The reason for his earlier 
resignation was that "it is against the cabinet rules on 
concurrent positions for him--the Transport Ministry's 
second-highest leader--to additionally become the head of an 
organization which is under the ministry's supervision" (the 
Transport Ministry's Tourism Department). However, putting a 
generous construction on the rules, a decision was later made 
that "it is all right if the [additional] post is served without 
pay and without the right of decision" (the same source). 
  Mr. Nikai inaugurated the "100-Person Committee Considering 
Japan's Tourism" in February. He enrolled into the membership 
the top-class organizations under the Transport Ministry's 
supervision such as the JR [Japan Railways] companies, major 
travel agencies, and the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. 
He placed the committee's Secretariat in the National 
Association of Tourist Organizations. The April issue of the 
association organ, in its last page, carries a colored ad by an 
airline company. An association worker admits that "airline 
companies can hardly refuse to place an ad because the 
parliamentary vice minister for transport is the honorary 
chairman of this organization." The rules on concurrent 
positions remain ambiguous. 
  On 24 June 1993, the day after Shinseito was inaugurated, 
Mr. 
Hata attended a party held by the party's Diet members in the 
New Otani Hotel. Faced with a barrage of questions from 
reporters as to such an old money-collecting method used since 
the LDP, he said in a harsh tone that "you are always talking 
about such things, and that is why you are dead wrong." 
  An LDP member is heard asking to himself in a whisper: "We 
were criticized about the relations between politics and money, 
and what makes them different from us?" 
<H5>  [25 Apr 94 p 23] </H5>
  [Text] "I did not expect him to go so far as to call it a 
`war of aggression.'" On 10 August 1993, year, speaking at his 
first press conference since his inauguration, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa clearly stated that the Pacific War was a "war 
of aggression," thereby becoming the first prime minister to do 
so. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
disclosed: "I proposed to Mr. Hosokawa that he show clearly that 
Japan has searched its soul deeply over its past and that it 
intends to tell right from wrong in a clear-cut manner in this 
regard for a fresh start. But I did not expect him to say that 
much..." 
  On the anniversary of the end of the war five days later, 
Mr. 
Hata did not make an appearance at the Yasukuni Shrine in Kudan, 
Tokyo. However, he already had paid a visit to the shrine on the 
previous day, shunning the public eye. When Hata attended a 
national memorial ceremony for the war dead, he was unexpectedly 
asked by reporters about his visit to the shrine. Taken by 
surprise, he asked back in a harsh tone: "How did you know 
that?" When asked, "Did you make the visit as a private 
individual or a public figure?" he declined to answer, saying 
that "this matter becomes an issue in foreign countries because 
you ask such questions." 
  Hata cannot become as reformist as Hosokawa on how to view 
the Pacific War. He is the type who is "everybody's friend." 
With this nature, how is he going to cope with the peace and 
defense issue on which the people are widely divided? Shinseito 
which heads the ruling coalition has inaugurated the Society for 
Visiting Yasukuni Shrine. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 
Minister Eijiro Hata and others attended the shrine's Spring 
Festival on the morning of 21 April. Shinseito is thus showing 
its unpainted face as a "conservative party." Until his 
secession from the LDP, Tsutomu Hata also worked as chairman of 
the "Society of Diet Members Who Visit Yasukuni Shrine Together" 
(membership: 210 lower house and upper house members). 
  A commencement ceremony was held in the National Defense 
Academy (Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture) on 20 March. Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Defense Agency Director 
General Kazuo Aichi of Shinseito delivered an address. 
  In contrast to Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's stress on 
the "construction of a substantial nation," Director General 
Aichi emphasized the Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ogawa-style theory of the state, saying that "we are asked to 
fulfill the responsibility and role commensurate with our 
international status." 
  A leading Defense Agency official makes the following remark 
in this connection: "Two days before the commencement ceremony, 
Mr. Aichi took a look at the draft of the address Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Takemura was scheduled to make, and then he himself 
composed his speech as director general on the manuscript paper 
we provided for him." 
  "We will be unable to take any step unless we prepare 
amendments to some domestic laws in the form of emergency 
defense legislation." This is what Mr. Ozawa said at a series of 
meetings attended by delegates of ruling coalition parties. 
Though deleted later, the term "collective measures" which 
reminds us of the "right of collective self-defense" was also 
incorporated into a draft agreement at one time. Some 
expressions [in the agreement] were corrected in the face of 
resistance by the SDPJ, which asked, "Do you all mean to say 
that you do not need both the Constitution and the SDPJ?" 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said: "We carried our point after 
all, and there is no room for interpreting any items agreed on 
as conducive to emergency defense legislation." However, other 
ruling coalition leaders show a cold response, saying that 
"there is no change in substance." 
  The prime minister cannot escape the criticism that he is 
performing only for show; nevertheless, he made the 
"announcement on the war of aggression" and delivered his speech 
in ordinary, casual suits at a Self-Defense Forces military 
parade, thereby bringing the people to keenly feel a stream of 
change from the LDP position on the security and defense issue. 
However, Shinseito led by Mr. Ozawa appears to be pursuing a 
"major country" policy line more than the LDP regime. 
  How will Mr. Hata steer the ship of state? His longtime 
friend Takashi Kosugi, an LDP lower house member, discloses: 
"His theory of the state is not clear in outline. He lends his 
ear to various opinions in a flexible manner, but he does not 
make self-assertions. It might be said that he goes with the 
general trend of the times. After all, he might follow the way 
Ozawa thinks. In this respect, I feel slightly uneasy." 
  Frays of patches show horribly in the coalition government 
as 
in a patchwork finished poorly, and such a coalition government 
is to make a start on 25 April.

  [Text] The following are recommendations (excerpts) 
contained in a report submitted by the government's Tax 
Commission to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 21 June. 
  Section 1. Developments in tax reform after the "Interim 
Report" 
  Section 2. Guidelines on concrete measures to implement tax 
reform: 
  1. Building a balanced taxation system: 
  (2) Under a comprehensive program to promote tax reform, 
it 
  is possible to implement the reduction of individual 
  income tax in advance of incrementing consumption 
tax. 
  2. Ensuring fairness in the tax burden 
  3. Promoting administrative and fiscal reforms: 
  This commission strongly urges that such reforms be 
implemented promptly and resolutely by both the national and 
local governments under a specific guideline, simultaneously 
with the implementation of concrete tax reform measures. 
Members of the commission expressed the opinion that the 
following specific steps be taken: Reorganization of the central 
government ministries and agencies, retrenchment and 
rationalization of semigovernmental corporations, 
rationalization of personnel size in both national and local 
governments, drastic review of all aspects of fiscal 
requirements, and active measures to ease government regulation 
and to narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices. 
While administrative reforms will not create substantial 
revenue resources immediately, commission members expressed the 
opinion that mid-term numerical targets or programs, such as a 
"five-year plan for administrative reform" should be formulated 
and implemented systematically by adopting concrete measures. 
  4. Feasible measures to cope with an aging society 
  (2) Increase in the people's share in the cost of dealing 
  with an aging society -- while it is believed that 
the 
  concept of a (welfare) vision needs more rigorous 
  consideration, and more efforts need to be made to 
  achieve greater rationality and efficiency in welfare 
  systems and policies, a considerable increase in the 
  people's financial burden is still inevitable. 
  (3) Improvement of the fiscal system 
  (4) Necessity of increasing the tax burden 
  2) After considerable deliberation on the 
(mechanical) 
  calculations [of the increase in tax burden], this 
  commission reached the following conclusions: 
  a. The people need to be informed 
straightforwardly 
  about the increase in tax burden brought about 
by 
  the increase in public services inherent in an 
  aging society. 
  b. Revenue sources for the redemption of stopgap 
  bonds should be dealt with in a proper way in 
the 
  process of tax reform. 
  c. It is best to avoid having excessive 
expectations 
  of a natural increase in tax collected. 
  d. Persistent efforts should undoubtedly be 
exerted 
  to implement administrative and fiscal reforms, 
  and to ensure fairness in the tax burden, along 
  with implementation of concrete tax reform 
  measures. The scale of tax increase should be 
  held down to the minimum through such efforts. 
  Section 3. Reduction of individual income tax: 
  1. Basic thinking: 
  Tax brackets in the progressive tax rate structure should be 
reclassified to lessen, as much as possible, the feeling among 
the working population of a heavy tax burden, particularly the 
middle- income group, the most productive segment of the labor 
force. 
  2. Tax rate structure: 
  The application of each tax bracket should be expanded as 
much as possible, particularly the 20-percent income tax 
bracket, and the 10-percent individual residence tax bracket. 
The highest tax rate should be reduced to about 50 percent. 
  3. Lowest taxable income: 
  In consideration of the additional burden on low-income tax 
payers brought about by the increase in consumption tax, the 
income threshold on which tax is paid will inevitably be raised. 
  Section 4. Increasing the consumption tax 
  1. Basic thinking: 
  It is necessary to raise the consumption tax rate, and 
increase the share of consumption tax in the tax structure as a 
whole. 
  2. Taxable consumption and tax rate structure: 
  No further exemptions from consumption tax should be 
allowed. 
The structure of a single applicable tax rate should be 
maintained. 
  3. Preferential systems for small businesses: 
  (1) Tax exemption system for businesses -- Measures to 
  eventually include relatively large establishments in 
  taxable businesses should be considered. 
  (2) Simplified taxation system -- Scope of application 
  should be narrowed down, while also giving 
consideration 
  to the clerical workload of small businesses. 
  (3) Deductible limit system -- Appropriate revision of 
the 
  system, including possible abolition, is necessary. 
  4. Tax deduction for purchasing costs: 
  Keeping proof-of-purchase documents (invoices) -- vouchers, 
delivery slips, or receipts -- should be included as one of the 
requirements. 
  Section 5. Augmenting local revenue sources 
  1. Local revenue sources: 
  (1) The commission agreed on the significance of paying 
  taxes in the localities and checking how such tax 
  revenues are spent. 
  2. Possibility of a local consumption tax: 
  (2) Due to the need to increase local revenue sources, 
  the commission deliberated extensively the issue of a 
  "local consumption tax." The issue was considered in 
  relation to the problem of reducing the tax burden 
for 
  individual residence tax, but the commission was not 
in 
  a position to decide whether it is appropriate to 
  introduce this tax at present. It would like to 
reach a 
  conclusion on the issue as soon as possible.

  [Text] The Economic Planning Agency [EPA] is to analyze the 
effects of deregulation on the economy. It will examine how 
deregulation measures -- such as reviewing the Large-Scale 
Retail Stores Law, liberalizing the information and 
communications sector, and easing rules on housing construction 
-- will contribute to economic growth and how these will affect 
consumer prices. By demonstrating deregulation's effectiveness 
with specific figures, the agency aims to provide a basis for 
promoting deregulation. It plans to inaugurate a research group 
composed of intellectuals as early as next week so that it will 
be able to compile the results of its assessment during July. 
  Private sector think tanks have conducted many surveys on 
the 
scale of the market and the possibility of market expansion when 
deregulation is promoted in each industry. Meanwhile, it is 
rare for the government to study comprehensively the effects of 
deregulation on the economy. 
  The government plans to compile external economic measures 
at 
the end of June which would include deregulation measures and 
macroeconomic policies. The EPA intends to examine whether the 
deregulation measures to be included in the external economic 
measures will be effective in causing economic growth. Its 
assessment is expected to center on the housing, information, 
and distribution sectors. The agency aims to provide specific 
figures on how much consumer prices will be lowered through a 
review of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, and on how 
effective the liberalization of the information and 
communications industry will be in improving the employment 
situation and attaining economic growth. 
  The EPA thinks that if companies' productivity and 
international competitiveness are enhanced through deregulation, 
"the Japanese economy's latent power for growth will be 
strengthened." In order to promote deregulation as early as 
possible, the agency plans to compile the results of its 
assessment in about a month, after the research group decides on 
the items to subject to analysis.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] 
decided on 16 June to ease regulations on mobile telephone base 
stations. So far, base stations have been required to obtain 
approval beforehand for frequency use. However, the MPT will 
introduce a "license system for designated comprehensive 
frequencies." This system will enable each base station to use 
all frequencies allocated to companies who own ground stations. 
This is one of the pillars of the deregulation measures the 
government's administrative reform promotion council 
headquarters and working group on information and communications 
will prepare by the end of this month. The system will take 
effect next January. This will enable mobile telephone 
companies save application fees when changing frequencies. In 
addition, it seems the system will also become a support measure 
for the Japan Mobile Telephone Company (IDO), which plans to 
increase its number of base stations to ease the trade frictions 
between Japan and the United States. 
  It is necessary to construct more ground stations because 
the 
mobile telephone market is expanding rapidly. According to the 
MPT, it seems that the number of ground stations will reach 
8,700, or 70 percent more than the current number, in two years. 
Currently, ordinary mobile telephone companies are using from 
10 to 50 channels at their base stations. But, they need to 
increase the number of bands [denpa su] they use to ease 
telephone congestion. 
  However, every time a new station is built or one station 
wants to increase its number of frequency bands, the current 
system requires the station and six to seven of its neighboring 
stations, which need to adjust their frequencies, to obtain 
approvals before making changes. Under the current system, one 
month or so is needed to examine applications before approval, 
creating obstacles to attempts to make changes to cope with the 
situation. 
  Because of this, the MPT decided to introduce the new 
system, 
designed to issue licenses to enable all stations to use all 
frequency bands allocated to companies which own ground 
stations. Under the new system, the companies will no longer 
need to apply for approval before changing the specifications 
for each base station. They will only need to notify the MPT 
after actually making changes based on their own judgment.

  [Text] The work of the Petroleum Policy Basic Issues 
Subcommittee of the Petroleum Council's Petroleum Section, which 
is discussing the issue of relaxation of petroleum industry 
regulations, is facing its greatest crisis. The "interim draft 
compilation" of the mired details of the discussion so far will 
be submitted in a "concentrated form" at the sixth meeting of 
the subcommittee on 9 June. It is expected that only a harsh 
refutation led by petroleum side members will result, the 
compilation of "an interim report" on the same day will be 
difficult, and it is certain that "final compilation" will be 
carried over until 20 June. Although the "compilation draft" 
that will be submitted to the subcommittee on 9 June is 
considered "to have the appearance of a mosaic" (Petroleum 
Department, Agency of Natural Resources and Energy), it seems 
that they have clearly worked out the direction toward 
relaxation of regulations on the whole. The concern with the 
contents is that the "basis" is the "Memo of Major Discussion 
Points" in the form of a consolidation of previous discussions 
submitted by the Secretariat to the subcommittee meeting held on 
19 May. The "draft compilation" will probably be created 
referring to this memo. Therefore, one can attempt to anticipate 
the "compilation" via the "Memo of Discussion Points"... 
  For the first point of discussion, "In what direction should 
we aim for a stable supply guarantee policy in the long term," 
noted in the memo are both the assertion that 1) "An oil crisis 
is generated every 10 years, and in the future, dependence on 
the Middle East will rise, tight supply and demand are 
anticipated, and we should aim at a stable supply for the future 
by a consumer-site refining method," and the idea that 2) 
"Considering the trend toward internationalization of the 
petroleum products market, especially the progress in 
integration of the Asian market, it will be impossible to close 
the domestic market forever, and also inappropriate from the 
viewpoint of opening up future prospects for the petroleum 
industry. Along with planning for internationalization of 
product price levels and price structure by liberalizing 
imports, we should consider a stable supply within an 
international market." However, it appears that the "trial 
draft" on 9 June will be closer to the second point. 
  Concerning the second discussion point, "Should the 
consumer-site refinery method be secured by the Designated 
Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law," the memo 
asserts: 1) "From the importance of a stable supply, it is 
necessary to secure systematically a consumer-site refinery 
method by the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional 
Measures Law, and the insurance premium for that should properly 
be borne by the public." 2) "The framework of the designated 
Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law has become 
such that imported goods do not flow directly into the domestic 
market, and it impedes the efficiency of the market and hinders 
the elimination of price structure distortion and the foreign 
and domestic price differential. Insurance premiums are too high 
in the current arrangement." 3) If there is an obligation for 
storage of imported products to guarantee a stable supply, that 
is sufficient and the law should be abrogated." 4) 
"Consumer-site refining is both economical and efficient and, 
considering that Japan's petroleum industry has international 
competitive power at the refining stage, it is excessive to 
guarantee the consumer-site refining system by the Designated 
Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law." Among 
these, ideas 2, 3, and 4 will probably be incorporated. 
  On the third point, "Will it be necessary to review the 
storage system in case of expanding imported products," this 
issue perceives the necessity of storage and it does not appear 
that it will result in a large dispute. 
  On the fourth point, "To what extent should we 
systematically 
guarantee the quality of petroleum products in the case of 
expanding imported products," it says: 1) "It is necessary to 
make a systematic guarantee in order to maintain the 
environment, safety, and existing high quality, including 
performance covering that." 2) "Supplying only high-quality 
products robs the consumer of the opportunity of selection, and 
we should supply products with diverse product quality." 3) 
"Based on the trends of various countries of Europe and the 
United States, we should continue to study in detail to what 
extent it is necessary to guarantee systematically the current 
high level of quality." This issue will probably be mentioned in 
the "compiled draft" with points 1 and 3 as the axis. 
  Three assertions are listed for the fifth point, "Is it 
necessary to manage the domestic distribution routes in 
peacetime from the viewpoint of response in an emergency," but 
as a whole, in preparing for a crisis and carrying out 
compulsory constraints on demand, there is a strong possibility 
that the direction will be indicated toward the necessity for 
service stations to accurately manage supply routes. 
  For the sixth and final point, "Shouldn't we proceed with 
distribution efficiency," the focus has been on assertions that: 
1) "Service station (SS) sales are one-fourth that of the United 
States and one-half that of Europe. The cost per sale is great 
and we should promote further efficiency." 2) "Expansion of 
imports is necessary for overall efficiency in the distribution 
system." 3) "We should indicate the direction of abolishing the 
designated district system based on the Gasoline Sales and 
Distribution Business Law." 4) "It is necessary to pursue 
cutting services in response to the criticism of excessive 
service, and safety regulations preventing introduction of the 
self-service method are excessive." 5) "By promoting 
distribution efficiency, 400,000 people have been hired 
centering on small service stations, which exerts a considerably 
bad effect on service station management itself." Here, it is 
certain that a tendency is shown toward the promotion of 
efficiency while being mindful of point 5. Viewed thus, the 
"interim compilation draft" which each member will have in his 
hands on 9 June will probably be rather remote from the 
assertions of the petroleum industry which considers that "the 
Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law is 
absolutely necessary" (Petroleum Federation chairman, Yasuoki 
Tateuchi). In any case, the "settlement" of "heated argument" 
anticipated by the subcommittee on 9 June will determine the 
future direction of the relaxation of petroleum industry 
regulations.

  [Text] What should be done to make gasoline cheaper? 
--Discussion surrounding the Designated Petroleum Products 
Import Provisional Measures Law and gasoline price issues have 
been the sole talk of the procurement side by the appearance of 
"100 yen a liter" in Aichi Prefecture, where resale within the 
industry is considered a procurement source. However, sound cost 
reduction measures also are being refined in a more modest sense 
by the industry. It is a reduction of distribution costs such as 
by enlargening tank trucks. Then, it also appears that something 
will come of substantial regulation relaxation. 
  A superlarge tank truck with a 24-kiloliter load capacity 
was 
seen for the first time in Japan at the Sakai oil refinery of 
General Sekiyu on 2 June. It is no more than a test vehicle with 
no General logo or anything on the body, but the appearance of a 
24-kiloliter truck was epochal for the industry. 
  Previously, a 20-kiloliter capacity tank truck had been the 
biggest in Japan, but up to a 30-kiloliter capacity has become 
possible by the relaxation of Fire Services Act regulations 
which took effect on 1 April. If there is 1.5 times the load 
capacity, very simply speaking, the number of truck trips will 
be two-thirds that of the present and it should become a big 
weapon in lowering distribution costs. 
  However, a different regulation wall is standing in the way 
even with this relaxation of regulations. That is the Road Law 
provision which prescribes that "The weight per vehicle axle 
must be less than 10 tons." A 20-kiloliter truck has a structure 
with a total of three axles, one axle directly under the 
driver's seat, and one axle each under the front part and the 
back part of the tank. The total weight of the 20 kiloliters of 
fuel and the vehicle body is less than 30 tons and it can clear 
the provision of 10 tons per axle. In transporting over 20 
kiloliters of fuel, however, somehow it must add one axle. 
Normally, the axle in the back part of the tank is changed to 
two axles. If that is done, the length of the vehicle will be 
extended for the added axle portion and balance. Vehicle length 
must be extended to a certain extent because of the need to 
enlarge the tank, and the Road Law regulation restricts free 
design. 
  The vehicle length of current 20-kiloliter trucks is 11.79 
meters, but according to test design, a 24-kiloliter capacity 
would be 14.70 meters, and a 26 kiloliter capacity would be 
15.50 meters. Considering turning radius and Japanese road 
conditions, it is said that 24 kiloliters is the maximum size 
that can be realized. The limit of 30 kiloliters obtained in the 
relaxation of regulations cannot be fully put to use. 
  Of course, the Road Law was determined considering strength 
of bridges and elevated roads and wear on roads. However, 
traveling with over 10 tons per axle is possible on many roads 
in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The petroleum companies also 
will not use superlarge trucks to deliver to all stations, and 
they should be able to use them within the limits of being able 
to make deliveries on roads where the strength is confirmed. 
  On the other hand, if a 30-kiloliter truck is achieve, not a 
few stations will raise a cry. According to the Fire Services 
Act, the largest storage tank that can be installed at a station 
is 50 kiloliters for gasoline, and 80 kiloliters is considered 
the limit for total light oil and kerosene. With the current 
mainstream 14-kiloliter trucks or 20-kiloliter trucks, the tank 
is finally filled with four or five delivery trips, but with the 
30 kiloliter, the tank will be filled with less than three trips. 
  In other words, a station cannot accept a truck unless the 
storage volume has decreased to about 60 percent and the 
inventory level becomes unstable at stations where a large 
amount is sold. That is because there is a fear that inventory 
will run out if there is some confusion in the truck service and 
deliveries are delayed. If the transport means is made large, 
the receiving tank also needs to be made large. 
  Another big thing in truck delivery is the problem of 
observing unloading. Under the present situation, a qualified 
person at the station must personally observe it. Except for 
stations with 24-hour operation, it is necessary for large 
trucks to run around during the day. If a driver could unload by 
himself, he could deliver late at night or early in the morning, 
taking advantage of relief from traffic congestion and shortened 
delivery time. 
  It is apt to be overlooked, but the greatest part in 
petroleum sales cost is distribution cost. In reducing costs on 
the procurement side such as import or transfer of business, 
uncertain factors such as market prices follow in the shadows. 
Thus, it is not strange that efforts to lower the price of 
gasoline begin from reduction of distribution costs by sound 
relaxation of regulations.

  [Text] Expecting the 1994 budget bill to soon be enacted, 
the Construction Ministry announced on 20 June the bidding 
systems it will adopt for ministry-controlled public works 
projects. According to a prearranged program, it will adopt an 
open bidding system for projects worth more than 730 million yen 
[Y], in which any firm can participate if it fulfills certain 
standards. But the standards include a criterion to limit the 
number of bidders to about 70. When the ministry applied an open 
bidding system to a public works project in fiscal year 1993 on 
an experimental basis, only 20 to 30 A-rank general contractors 
were allowed to bid. The new open bidding system will likely 
double this number and facilitate competition. 
  For projects worth between Y200 million and Y730 million, 
the 
ministry will adopt a public offering designated bidding system, 
in which it invites contractors wishing to take part in biddings 
and designates about 10 of them as bidders. For some of 
projects worth between Y100 million and Y200 million, the 
ministry will introduce on an experimental basis an 
intention-confirmation designated bidding system, in which it 
first invites about 20 contractors, selects 10 based on whether 
or not they have a desire to participate in biddings, and allows 
those selected to make a tender. 
  The ministry plans to notify eight regional construction 
bureaus, which are in charge of carrying out public works 
projects, of the adoption of the new bidding systems on 21 June. 
Meanwhile, regional construction bureaus will announce details 
of projects subject to the new systems, such as project names, 
work location, term of works, work outlines, and a bidding 
schedule immediately after the 1994 budget bill becomes law. 
  Judging from past results, the ministry expects the number 
of 
projects subject to an open bidding system will be about 100. 
To participate in open tenders, contractors will be required to 
receive certain marks in a screening on management and the value 
of works completed in the past. The ministry has set the marks 
in such a way that about 70 contractors can pass the screening. 
  Under the public-offering designated bidding system, 
contractors can reflect their opinion in biddings to some 
extent, but to do so, they have to be designated as bidders by 
government offices which place orders. The 
intention-confirmation designated bidding system has an effect 
tantamount to increasing the number of designated bidders to 20 
from the current 10.

<F P=106> [Article by Toshiaki Kumaki: "Expenditures Related to </F>
Electronics, Information, and Communications; Preparations for 
Establishment of Product Liability Law and Introduction of 
Educational-Use Computers"] 
  [Text] Funds in the overall general account of the 
government's FY94 budget to promote science and technology 
(S&amp;T) 
amount to 636.4 billion yen, an increase of 7.1 percent over the 
preceding fiscal year's initial budget. This budget's unusual 
feature is that of the funds provided for establishment of the 
product liability law by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) and 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), 5.7 
billion yen was earmarked by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to 
introduce educational-use computers. The general account budget 
under MITI's control is 898.6 billion yen, an increase of 2 
percent over the preceding year. The general account budget of 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) is 42.5 
billion yen, an increase of 2.3 percent. Defense-related 
expenditures are being restrained, but defense research and 
development (R&amp;D) expenses were increased by 1.4 percent over 
the preceding year. 
  This article examined R&amp;D and capital investment outlays 
related to electronics, information and communications in the 
FY94 draft budget. First, S&amp;T-related outlays and 
defense-related funds for the entire government were compiled by 
separate budget items. Next, budgets controlled by MITI and MPT 
were explained line by line. In addition, the FY93 third 
supplementary budget was analyzed. 
  The government's total general account budget is 
73,081,669,430,000 trillion yen an increase of 1 percent over 
FY93 intitial budget (decrease of 2.9 percent from FY93 second 
supplementary budget) (see Table 1 and reference items 1 and 2).

  The FY94 general account budget of PMO's EPA totals 
55,719,816,000 yen. 
  The government will submit a product liability bill to the 
129th Diet (ordinary session) which is currently underway. In 
anticipation of the product liability law enactment, the EPA 
submitted a budget which included establishment of an agency to 
investigate causes of violations to prevent damages to consumers. 
  Specifically, the sum of 3,118,543,000 yen was secured as 
funds needed to promote consumer protection measures. Of this 
sum, subsidies to organize livelihood information establishments 
amount to 591,377,000 yen (includidng 252,786,000 yen in grants 
to organize agencies to investigate causes of damages to 
consumers). Grants to the Better Living Information Center total 
2,397,992,000 yen and operational funds to the center total 100 
million yen (including 27.88 million yen as contractual fees to 
study promotional measures for consumer safety). 
  The total FY94 budget of the MOE is 5,543,159,662,000 yen, 
an 
increase of 2.2 percent over the initial FY93 budget (4.5 
percent less than the second supplementary budget). Of 
promotional funds for school education, the said ministry 
requested 8,435,333,000 yen as expenses needed to promote 
science courses, etc. Of this sum, subsidies to local public 
bodies (share of burden on national treasury, 1/2) and to school 
corporate bodies (national treasury burden, 3/4) total 
2,141,558,000 yen and arithmetic-mathematics promotion funds to 
local public bodies (treasury burden, 1/2) and school corporate 
bodies (treasury burden, 3/4) total 387,442,000 yen. As funds to 
purchase educational-use computers, 5.7 billion yen was allotted 
to local public bodies (treasury burden, 1/3) and as educational 
modernization funds, 262,330,000 yen was earmarked for local 
public bodies (treasury burden, 1/2) and school corporate bodies 
(treasury burden, 1/3). 
<H5>  General Remarks: S&amp;T Promotion Funds Increase 7.1 Percent </H5>
  The government's overall S&amp;T-related expenditures are 
included in items, such as energy measures and S&amp;T promotion 
funds (Note: In the government's budgetary items, S&amp;T 
promotion 
funds are not expenditures earmarked for a specific ministry but 
appropriated for all of the ministries and the Diet). The S&amp;T 
promotion funds are divided further into other items, such as 
space development expenditures, computer industry promotional 
funds, etc. (see Table 2(a)). Government organs having 
jurisdiction over S&amp;T promotional funds are shown in Table 
2(b). 
S&amp;T promotion funds are not handled by the PMO's Science and 
Technology Agency (STA) alone.

  The total budget of the various ministries' test and 
research 
organs, excepting expenses related to space and marine 
development, is 201,724,000,000 yen (up 4.7 percent). R&amp;D of 
superconducting materials will continue to be promoted by PMO's 
STA, et al. In MITI's basic researches on industrial 
technologies, R&amp;D will be carried out in the fields of new 
materials, biotechnology, etc. 
  In accordance with the Council for Science and Technology 
(CST) policy, the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting 
Science and Technology are used to regulate progress of 
important research activities. Funds are to be expended on trial 
operations of a research information network linking the various 
agencies' research organs and on establishment of a solid data 
base. A budget of 15.5 billion yen (up 16.5 percent) was secured. 
  Consideration was given to assisting scientific researches 
by 
universities and technological developments by the private 
sector in setting up S&amp;T research subsidies and contractual 
funds. For example, as scientific research subsidies and 
allotment to the International Phase of Ocean Drilling (IPOD), a 
budget of 82.713 billion yen (up 11.9 percent) was appropriated. 
  In other expenses, 3.213 billion yen (up 19 percent) was 
funded for frontier research by the Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research. Four new subjects were added to the 
Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology Operation Project 
[ERATO Project] of Research Corporation of Japan [JRC] and a 
budget of 7.449 billion yen (up 8.6 percent) was earmarked. 
Accelerators will be upgraded and buildings will be constructed 
at the large radiation facility. 
  The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development 
Organization [NEDO] will continue R&amp;D of medical and welfare 
equipment development and global environmental industrial 
technology and promote activities to develop practical 
applications of welfare apparatus. It will also start anew a 
project to promote development of innovative technologies to 
cultivate new areas.

  National defense outlays total 4,683,548,427,000 yen (see 
Table 4). This is an increase of 0.9 percent over the FY93 
initial budget and 1.4 percent over the second supplementary 
budget. The increase was restricted in accordance with the 
"Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program (FY91-95)," revised by the 
National Security Council and the cabinet on 18 December 1992, 
setting forth the policy to keep increases at a minimum level 
because of fiscal conditions and to maintain a balanced setup.

  Also, on the basis of the consultative reply from the 
Industrial Structure Council, MITI will carry out comprehensive 
product safety measures covering both accident prevention and 
damage relief involving the product liability law. For this 
purpose, a budget of 747 million yen was earmarked in the FY94 
budget. 
<H5>  Promote Information Services and Augmentation of R&amp;D </H5>
Infrastructure 
  The budget item to strengthen the infrastructure toward a 
visual information society is intended to help formulate 
concepts toward realization of such a society and support 
multimedia software development. The budget is 1.379 billion 
yen, an increase of 31.3 percent over the FY93 initial budget. 
  The development of a new information processing technology 
is 
aimed at developing the so-called fourth-dimensional computer. A 
computer storing learning and recognition functions, which can 
process the world's voluminous and diverse information on real 
time, will be developed. As outlays to accomplish this, 4.986 
billion yen, an increase of 38.3 percent over the FY93 budget, 
was set aside. 
  Under the budget item of technical R&amp;D infrastructure, 
strengthening of cross-sectional and interdisciplinary researche 
and comprehensive promotion of industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D 
systems and 
the New Sunshine Program are listed. 
  Comprehensive promotion of industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D 
systems is a 
new program that was reorganized in FY93. To fund it, 23.584 
billion yen, a drop of 3.1 percent, was allocated. Of this sum, 
401 million yen, an increase of 63 percent, will be allotted to 
preparatory researches for projects. The synergy ceramic project 
will be added as a new project. 
  The New Sunshine Program, too, is a project that was 
reorganized in FY93. Development of new energy sources and 
comprehensive development of energy conserving technology and 
global environmental technology will be promoted. The budget is 
an increase of 0.9 percent at 52.771 billion yen. 
  As for industrial property rights administration handled by 
the Patent Office, the two main goals will be strengthening of 
measures to accelerate inspections and processing and the 
internationalization of the property rights administration. 
  To speed up inspections and processing, an increase of 11.4 
percent at 32.692 billion yen will be appropriated to steadily 
advance the paperless plan which has been carried out until now. 
  Internationalization of industrial property rights 
administration is a budget item to internationally disseminate 
patent information through English copy CD-ROM [compact 
disc-read only memory] and dispatch patent officers to 
international conferences and the sum of 2.185 billion yen, an 
increase of 11 percent, was allotted. 
<H5>  Promote Environmental and Energy Measures </H5>
  MITI will promote establishment of an environment-friendly 
economic society and new deployment of comprehensive energy 
measures. 
  In establishment of an environment-friendly economic 
society, 
the following items are mentioned: 1) promotion of measures to 
conserve and recycle resources; 2) promotion of corporate 
activities friendly to the environment; 3) comprehensive 
promotion of measures to protect the ozone layer; and 4) 
promotion of voluntary safety management of chemical materials. 
  To promote measures to conserve and recycle resources, 2.832 
billion yen, up 27.3 percent from the FY93 initial budget, was 
appropriated. 
  Policies will be formulated to promote recycling, recycling 
plant projects, information dissemination, development of 
recycling technology, etc. 
  To promote environment-friendly corporate activities, the 
sum 
of 80 million yen was newly secured. A systematic framework will 
be established to accelerate voluntary and aggressive corporate 
actions to reduce the environmental burden. 
  Comprehensive promotion of ozone-layer protection measures 
was allotted 518 million yen, up 1,104.6 percent from the FY93 
budget of 43 million yen. Recycling of certain 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds, development of new alternate 
products (third-generation CFC's) and guidance to small-and 
medium-enterprises will be promoted. 
  In the new deployment of comprehensive energy measures, 
2.033 
billion yen was appropriated to promote dissemination of solar 
power generation systems for residential use. Furthermore, to 
promote dissemination of clean energy automobiles, a budget 
increase of 59.4 percent over FY93 at 2.016 billion yen was 
allotted and subsidies will be granted to remodeling of natural 
gas automobiles and eco-stations. 
  In addition, to cope with the aging society, 1.199 billion 
yen, an increase of 13.4 percent, was secured to promote R&amp;D 
and 
dissemination of medical welfare equipment technology. 
<H5>  MPT To Promote Optical Fiber Investments </H5>
  The total FY94 general account budget of the MPT is 
42,466,648,000 yen (see Tables 6(a), 6(b) and reference item 5). 
This is an increase of 2.3 percent over the FY93 initial budget. 
As radio wave fees, which became a revenue source in FY93, 7.414 
billion yen, down 2 percent from FY93, was set aside.

  In the FY94 tax system revision, the new communications 
network tax allowances were increased to promote capital 
investments by telecommunications enterprises. In national 
taxes, optical fiber cables (relay system) and synchronous 
digital transmission devices (module "C") have been added as 
facilities covered by the promotional tax allowances. Through 
this action, special depreciation of 20 percent (measure 
effective for two years) will be permitted, the same as for 
multiple communication converters and communications network 
control devices. 
  In local taxes, as for optical fiber cables, synchronous 
digital transmission devices (module "A"), multiple 
communication converters and communications network control 
devices which will be covered by the promotional tax system, the 
assessment basis of fixed assets taxes will be reduced to 
two-thirds for the 5-year period after acquisition (measure 
effective for three years). 
  In addition, special fixed assets tax measures will be 
established for digital facilities newly acquired by first-class 
telecommunications enterprises. For local taxes, the assessment 
basis of fixed assets taxes will be reduced to three-fourths for 
the 5-year period after acquisition (measure effective for three 
years). 
<H5>  To Sponsor Plenary Session of ITU in Kyoto </H5>
  The MPT earmarked 72 million yen as expenses to promote 
international coordination. That is a big increase of 500 
percent over the FY93 initial budget. The reason is that a 
budget of 69 million yen was allocated to sponsor a plenary 
session of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 
Kyoto. 
  To promote international cooperation, the same amount as 
FY93, or 632 million yen, was budgeted. Of this sum, 23 million 
yen will be spent for joint international researches on 
international video broadcasting in the Asian region and 16 
million yen for exchange of telecommunications technical 
researchers among Asia-Pacific countries. 
  For space communication technology R&amp;D, the sum of 1.424 
billion yen was budgeted, a sizeable increase of 14.5 percent 
over FY93. To keep up with the progress in R&amp;D of 
experimental 
satellites in the next-generation communication and broadcasting 
fields, 121 million yen has been included in the budget. R&amp;D 
of 
next-generation satellites has also been secured through 
budget-restoring negotiations by MPT's Finance Division chief. 
<H5>  Stengthen Projects to Fill Telecommunication Gaps </H5>
  Projects to fill telecommunication gaps are public works 
controlled by the MPT. In FY94 budget, a total of 2.554 billion 
yen, a decline of 16 percent from the FY93 budget, was 
allocated. However, as new projects, 717 million yen for 
projects to upgrade regional-livelihood informational 
communication infrastructure and 69 million yen for projects to 
overcome poor television receptions in the Ogasawara District 
have been included. 
  Projects to upgrade regional-livelihood informational 
communications infrastructure were approved through budgetary 
negotiations by Takenori Kanzaki, MPT minister. They will be 
advanced as pilot-model projects toward organization of advanced 
informational communications infrastructure. The projects are: 
1) organization of an "information feedback promotion center," 
which will become the center to prevent polarization of 
information; 2) establishment of a "local autonomous network" as 
the main facility to transmit and receive regional information; 
3) establishment of a "tele-work center" to increase regional 
employment opportunities and vitalize local economies by 
utilizing informational communications; and 4) establishsment of 
"next-generation local cable TV" to present video information 
suited to regional needs. 
  In addition, the program to fill telecommunication gaps will 
include expansion of works to build steel towers for mobile 
communication uses and promotion of projects to eliminate 
viewing and hearing difficulties in civilian TV broadcasts and 
remove obstacles in receiving civilian medium-wave radio 
broadcasts. Also, the project to eliminate viewing and hearing 
difficulties in civilian TV broadcasts in Okinawa Prefecture's 
Sakishima district was completed in FY93. 
  In accordance with Hosokawa cabinet's policy emphasizing 
consumer welfare, a telecommunications monitoring system will be 
established. Through budgetary negotiations conducted by Futoshi 
Shirai, administrative vice minister, a budget of 11 million yen 
was newly acquired. 
<H5>  Special Account Will Promote Systematization </H5>
  The special account of MPT's projects continues to advance 
systematization in various fields. In FY94 budget, 67 million 
yen was allotted for the first time to strengthen rapid postal 
services. As new projects, the issuance of high-quality Letax 
[electronic mail (letter fax)], improvement of services to 
receive Letax through telephones and implementation of services 
to receive Letax through personal computer communications have 
been incorporated. 
  For installment of high-performance mail processing 
equipment, etc., a budget of 13.322 billion yen, up 25.4 percent 
from FY93 initial budget, was allocated. With this budget, 
addressee sorting equipment, etc., will be increased. 
Development and installment of registered mail sorting 
equipment, etc., will be undertaken for the first time. 
  A budget of 92.716 billion yen, up 18.3 percent from FY93, 
was earmarked to advance mechanization and systematization. A 
comprehensive postal information-communication network, etc., 
will be established. 
  To upgrade the postal network as a regional information 
base, 
3.607 billion yen, an increase of 46 percent, was secured. 
Expansion of the video network using satellite communications, 
introduction of the teleconferencing system, introduction of new 
media equipment, development and advancement of postal bureau's 
terminals for joint communications use, will be undertaken. 
  To support business activities, 362 million yen, up 61.6 
percent, was earmarked and expansion of DM (direct mail) 
seminars, etc., will be promoted. 
<H5>  Third Supplementary Budget To Stimulate Economy </H5>
  The third FY93 supplementary budget will carry over into 
FY94. MITI's and MPT's electronics-related appropriations are 
explained below. 
  As its third supplementary budget, MITI appropriated 124 
billion yen. Of this sum, 15.13 billion yen will be allotted to 
promoting creation of new industries, 10.2 billion yen to 
advancing informational services, 3.9 billion yen to

  [Text] The Research and Development Guidance Committee of 
the Industrial Technology Council which is an advisory organ of 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] chaired 
by Technology Information Center Director Hiroshi Inose compiled 
a publication titled "Guide for Research and Development of 
Industrial Science Technology," which provides a status report 
on research and development projects undertaken by MITI. The 
report recommends assignment of the highest priority to the 
building of "research and development infrastructure" projects 
such as data networks and data bases. It also lists as future 
development issues nine sectors such as data communications and 
energy and environmental technology. 
  The guide identifies as important construction of technical 
infrastructure for MITI-sponsored national projects and 
Industrial Technology Institute-sponsored research and 
development project-related data networks and data bases and 
standards. Additionally, it recommends priority implementation 
of work in three sectors: 1) reinforcement of basic and creative 
research; 2) response to global and international issues such as 
the environment; and 3) research and development that aims at 
the enhancement of the public living standards and welfare. 
  In the way of research and development organizations, the 
report recommends that the 15 national research agencies 
supervised by the Industrial Technology Institute be treated as 
the core organizations for experimentation (COE). It also points 
to the need to expand programs such as tax systems and fiscal 
investment and loan programs to assist in research and 
development work of the private sector.

  [Text] Nissan Motor is moving to install lean-burning 
engines in almost all passenger car classes with 2,000-cc and 
under displacement by 2000. Following the "Sunny 1500 CX" 
recently put on sale, it is scheduled to be carried on some 
"Pulsars" that will have a full model change next year. 
Thereafter, it plans to carry it on a total of eight car classes 
along with full model changes. Nissan is promoting cost 
reductions by sharing parts with existing engines and considers 
it a product where low price and low fuel consumption coexist. 
  Favored as targets for carrying the lean-burning engine are 
the eight car classes of Pulsar, "Bluebird," "Primera," 
"Presea," "March," "Avenir," and "AD wagon," in addition to the 
Sunny which already has been set. There also are the 
"Cedric/Gloria," "Laurel," and "Sefillo" 2000-cc types, but it 
seems that it will be narrowed to classes below 1800-cc to 
2000-cc middle displacement. 
  For the engine, existing engines will be made lean burning 
like the "GA" engine of the Sunny. In the future, Nissan will 
change to lean-burning car classes carrying the "SR" engines 
such as the Bluebird and Primera and the "CG" engine for the 
March along with full model changes. In particular, the policy 
is to cultivate cars carrying lean-burning engines as the 
central type for the Sunny and Bluebird which are the highest 
volume sales classes. 
  The lean-burning engine is a mechanism where fuel 
consumption 
is reduced by increasing the volume of air for burning gasoline. 
Toyota Motor and Honda Motor were forerunners in this field, but 
Nissan has perfected a low-price engine by greatly improving the 
fuel consumption of the GA engine itself along with full model 
change of the Sunny, and adopting the lean-burning method in 
addition to that. 
  Viewed by body price, the lean-burning cars of other 
companies are about 100,000 yen higher than the regular type. 
Nissan is proceeding in part sharing with regular engines that 
have rather low fuel consumption and has held the increase to 
about 30,000 yen. It estimates that if it increases the car 
classes carrying it and further raises productivity, it can 
lower prices further. The strategy is to cultivate the low fuel 
consumption, lean-burning engine as the mainstream while 
avoiding an increase in body prices.

  [Text] On 14 June, a government source disclosed that an 
idea has surfaced to formulate a new 10-year public investment 
plan to be effective beginning FY1994 or FY1995. The new plan 
will not be drawn up by simply increasing a 430 trillion yen [Y] 
budget for the current basic plan for public investment 
(effective FY1991 to FY2000), which is under government review. 
The source said the government is considering appropriating 
about Y550 trillion for the new plan, which is over Y100 
trillion more than the budget for the current plan, and using 
65-70 percent of it for investment in programs to improve 
"living conditions and cultural facilities" in view of the need 
to better a quality of life. The new plan's formulation is 
aimed at showing other countries the government's strong 
determination to stimulate domestic demand. The government will 
finalize the plan in June and will present it to the July G-7 
summit (Naples summit) as a main pillar of Japan's macroeconomic 
policy. 
  In an external economic policy outline issued at the end of 
March, the government indicated a plan to increase the budget 
for the current public investment plan and to review the budget 
allotment in the plan. Based on this, the government has been 
studying specific measures. But the budget increase is possible 
only if financial resources are secured. Thus, depending on the 
final content of a tax reform program, the size of the increase 
may possibly be reduced. 
  The idea about the new plan has surfaced because the current 
plan no longer fits the actual situation, as a result of an 
increase in public investment proposed in a series of 
pump-priming packages. Public investment during the FY1991-93 
period is expected to increase about 10 percent from the 
previous period. Even if the government increases public 
investment by merely 3 percent every year from now on, the 
current plan will easily be carried out. 
  Since Japan entered the era of low economic growth, 
commodity 
prices have stabilized. Now, the target of 5-percent economic 
growth in nominal terms, a prerequisite to carrying out the 
current plan, does not fit the actual state of the economy at 
all. Therefore, some government officials are calling for 
reviewing the rate of year-on-year increase in public investment 
(which is set at 5.7 percent under the current plan) accordingly. 
  However, even if the increase rate is lowered, "it is still 
possible to increase the budget for a new plan by Y100 trillion" 
from that for the current plan because planned spending on each 
year's public investment is already high due to an increase in 
public investment proposed in pump-priming packages, a 
government source said. 
  The current plan appropriates about 60 percent of the budget 
to investment in programs to improve "living conditions and 
cultural facilities," including water supply and sewage systems, 
parks, housing and housing sites, and welfare facilities. In 
the third supplementary budget for FY1993, the government 
allotted most of public investment budget for living-related 
programs. It also reviewed the ratio of allotment in the FY1994 
budget. As a result, if a new plan is formulated based on the 
FY1993 and FY1994 budgets, investment in programs to improve 
"living conditions and cultural facilities" will increase to 
65-70 percent. 
  The reason the government is studying the new plan is that 
it 
thinks it can show other countries its strong determination to 
expand domestic demand if it forwards a new plan with an 
increased budget. Also, the new plan will enable the government 
to speed up the review of the ratio of budget allotment to 
public works projects, although many are opposed to it.

  [Text] On 10 June, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications 
Higasa submitted and received approval of the 1994 edition of 
the "Report on the Current Status of Telecommunications" 
(Telecommunications White Paper). The white paper positions this 
year as the "First Year for Multimedia" in which work on the 
next-generation telecommunication network is undertaken in 
earnest and predicts that the new age will stimulate the birth 
of new industries and contribute to the improvement in working 
conditions. It also provides the assessment that the multimedia 
age will be effective in resolving the issues of the aging of 
society and over-concentration of the population in the Tokyo 
area. Further, the report indicates the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [MPT] will provide support for such programs 
by preparing a multimedia construction program and conducting 
leading-edge research. 
  The MPT will publish the white paper in printed form as well 
as in CD-ROM (compact disk, read-only memory) format. Release of 
the white paper will be on a nonprofit basis and in the form of 
loans to interested parties beginning in July. 
  The most recent version of the white paper is characterized 
by the fact that all of Chapter 3 is devoted to the review of 
multimedia. The paper introduces multimedia systems already in 
use or being developed and refers to television broadcasting 
enabling the selective reception of images and accompanying 
audio data, use of interactive cable television (CATV) to 
reserve tickets and on-line shopping and technological 
experimentation using virtual reality techniques to engage in 
four-party remote design of aircraft through computer terminals. 
  The paper identifies four issues which must be addressed in 
the commercialization of these services: 1) nationwide 
construction of an optical fiber network; 2) development and 
standardization of data communication technology and formats; 3) 
development of application software; and 4) revision of social 
systems and customs such as intellectual property ownership 
systems and protection of privacy. The MPT stresses 
implementation of policies aimed at the realization of such 
services. 
  It also summarizes the status of construction and usage of 
data communication infrastructure and equipment as of 1992. It 
mentions that contracts for cellular telephones increased by 
18.8 percent over the prior year and conspicuous growth in use 
of paging systems and household use of facsimile machines. The 
paper also mentions that class-1 telecommunications operators 
that operate independent communications facilities and offer 
telecommunications services total 80 companies and have 
experienced an increase in revenues of 4.7 percent, which was 
better than other industries.

  [Text] The central Vietnamese city of Hue suddenly 
suspended airing of the BBC TV news in mid-May, apparently in an 
effort to block out possible reports that several imprisoned 
local Buddhist monks had mounted a hunger strike. Since late 
last year, the city's TV channel had surprised Hue residents by 
relaying the BBC's satellite news service free to anyone with a 
TV set. Shortly before the broadcasts were cut, Vietnamese 
exiles in France had said that several monks had stopped eating 
to protest against their arrest in May 1993 for blocking traffic 
during a demonstration in which they were demanding greater 
independence for the Buddhist church.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Environment ministers and 
senior officials from 17 Asia-Pacific countries began a two-day 
conference Tuesday [21 June] to discuss ways of promoting 
regional cooperation in tackling environmental problems. 
  Participants in the environment congress for Asia and the 
Pacific (Eco Asia `94), under way in Omiya outside Tokyo, also 
include delegates from the Asian Development Bank and 10 other 
international organizations. 
  The conference participants are discussing recent global 
trends for sustainable development, in keeping with decisions 
made at the 1992 earth summit in Rio de Janeiro. The theme of 
that summit was "Ecologically Sustainable Development." 
  Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja, the 
keynote speaker, said the political and economic basis for 
resolving environmental issues should be radically altered in 
the region, which contains more than half the world's population 
and is undergoing rapid urbanization and economic growth. 
  But a Chinese delegate said prices for the region's primary 
products are low and growth can now only be guaranteed if the 
region's resources are used to excess. 
  The Chinese delegate said this can only be remedied if 
developed countries cooperate by supplying funds and technology 
to developing countries. 
  A Canadian delegate recommended devising targets for the 
preservation or improvement of the environment, while a delegate 
from the United Nations University suggested the setting up of a 
center for the supply of information on the environment and 
technology. 
  On Wednesday, delegates will discuss a long-term outlook for 
the region, strategies to cope with urbanization, and 
cooperation among regional government authorities and agencies.

  [Text] Omiya, Japan, June 22 KYODO -- Representatives from 
16 countries in the Asia-Pacific region ended a two-day 
environmental meeting Wednesday [22 June] with a call for the 
development of sustainable cities and the protection of island 
nations from the effects of global warming. 
  The call was included in a document adopted at the 
environment congress for Asia and the Pacific (Eco Asia `94) in 
Omiya, Saitama Prefecture. 
  Senior officials from 16 governments, including five 
ministers, as well as representatives from eight international 
organizations attended the congress. 
  The congress, the third since 1991, reviewed progress in 
achieving environmentally sustainable development in the region 
since the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), otherwise known as the earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro 
in June 1992. 
  The document, issued in the name of the conference 
chairwoman, Environment Agency Director General Toshiko 
Hamayotsu, said the region needs to shift from theoretical 
considerations to "concerted political and practical actions, 
international cooperation, and sufficient institutional and 
capacity building." 
  Countries represented at the congress are home to more than 
half the world's population, with millions of people 
concentrated in rapidly growing cities. 
  The document notes the concern of delegates over pollution 
and urban crowding in the region caused by rapid economic 
development at the expense of the environment. 
  It urges, for the first time at an Eco Asia meeting, the 
development of the concept of sustainable cities. 
  It also calls for developed countries to "change their mass 
consumption lifestyles, provide support for realization of 
sustainable development in developing countries and prevent the 
export of pollution." 
  "Solid waste disposal has become a critical issue in this 
region," the document says. 
  The document also incorporates a call made Tuesday by 
Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja to "tackle 
the problems" of small island states. 
  Indonesia and a number of other Pacific nations incorporate 
thousands of small, low-lying islands which could be threatened 
if global warming causes a rise in sea levels. 
  Although many delegates favored establishment of an Eco Asia 
secretariat in Japan, opinion was not unanimous and the document 
merely calls for "development mechanisms for smooth and 
effective implementation of Eco Asia activities." 
  Malaysian Environment Minister Hieng Ding Law, who served as

  [Text] BANGKOK, June 22 (AFP) -- The Australian embassy in 
Rangoon Wednesday denied a report that it had conveyed an offer 
from a private Australian aid group to help Burma's junta 
develop border areas. 
  Ambassador Stuart Hume, reached by telephone from Bangkok, 
said that, contrary to the Radio Rangoon report, he had conveyed 
no such offer in talks Friday with Burma's minister for border 
areas development, Lieutenant General Maunt Thint. 
  Hume said he had raised the general question of access of 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to people in the border 
areas, including zones inhabited by former insurgents. 
  "We sought an assurance from the minister that NGOs were 
free 
to work in the border areas, which are frequently the most 
disadvantaged and where humanitarian needs are often the 
greatest," Hume said. 
  The minister responded that NGOs were "welcome," the 
ambassador said. 
  Some 10 NGOs are currently working on projects in Burma. 
NGOs 
set up their own projects in areas in need, rather than 
participating in programs put together by the ruling junta, 
Rangoon-based diplomats said. 
  Australia and other Western nations have restricted 
assistance to Rangoon as a means of pressuring the junta to 
introduce democratic reforms. 
  Canberra ended all official assistance to Rangoon after the 
military seized power in September 1988, killing thousands of 
people as it crushed a nationwide pro-democracy movement.

  [Text] Malaysia appreciates the U.S. concern over the 
formation of the East Asia Economic Caucus, EAEC, but assures 
the United States that the proposed forum will not weaken or 
undermine APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). Defense 
Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said it was rather 
disheartening to learn that the United States had formally 
informed Japan that it was opposed to the ASEAN proposal of the 
EAEC. 
  He said it was rather surprising since the concept ideally 
promotes market-driven open regionalism and supports regional 
economic cooperation. He said this when opening the two-day 
fifth U.S.-Malaysia colloquium jointly organized by ISIS 
[Institute of Strategic and International Studies] Malaysia and 
the Asia Foundation in Washington. Datuk Sri Najib, in his 
opening remarks, said that he was aware of the domestic public 
opinion in the U.S. and even Congressional opposition to such an 
initiative, especially when it does not include the U.S. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs 
Winston Lord, who was present at the gathering, said that the 
U.S. had given its initial response on the EAEC proposal to its 
ASEAN friends as well as Japan.

<F P=106> [By Lichong Angkui and Abdul Karim Mustafa] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Friday -- The National Front [BN] 
Supreme Council today unconditionally admitted the PDS [Sabah 
Democratic Party] and the PBRS [Sabah People's United Party] as 
BN component parties. 
  The decision to admit the two parties, which broke away from 
the PBS [Sabah United Party], was made at a meeting of the BN 
Supreme Council this evening. However, the BN refused to admit 
Setia [Sabah People's United Democratic Party] into its fold. 
  The meeting, lasting over one hour, was chaired by Datuk Sri 
Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and attended by leaders of all the 12 BN 
component parties. Also present were UMNO [United Malays 
National Organization] Deputy President Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim 
and BN Secretary General Datuk Mohamed Rahmat. 
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Dr. Mahathir said 
the leaders of all the BN component parties unanimously approved 
the admission of the PDS and the PBRS into the BN. 
  "The BN Supreme Council considered the request of the three 
parties to join BN during its meeting today. After lengthy 
discussions, we decided to admit the PDS and the PBRS, but not 
Setia. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  "The two parties were admitted unconditionally as full BN 
members," he said. 
  The PDS was established by former PBS deputy president Datuk 
Bernard Dompok, while the PBRS is led by former PBS secretary 
general Datuk Joseph Kurup. The PDS currently has 12 state 
assemblymen, while Kurup is the sole PBRS state assemblyman. 
  On 31 May, the Sabah BN agreed to admit the PDS and the PBRS 
into its fold. A day later, Datuk Mark Koding, president of 
Akar [People's Justice Front], stated that his party remained 
opposed to the entry of the breakaway PBS groups into the BN. 
  The PDS and the PBRS were established after the PBS, led by 
Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, lost power when some of its state 
assemblymen quit the party and joined the BN. 
  The Sabah BN now has seven parties with the admission of the 
parties. They are the UMNO, the Akar, the LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party], SAPP [Sabah Progressive Party], the MCA 
[Malaysian Chinese Association], the PDS, and the PBRS. 
  Dr. Mahathir also said that he will discuss with Sabah Chief 
Minister Tan Sri Sakaran Dandai the filling of the post of the 
deputy chief minister reserved for the non-Muslim indigenous 
Sabahans and several other posts. 
  "I think the admission of the two parties will not cause any 
problems because the decision was made unanimously. All the BN 
leaders agreed," he said. 
  Concerning Akar's opposition, Dr. Mahathir said: "That party 
gave its opinion. After listening to all opinions, we made a 
decision and all agreed."

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 22 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- A 
two-day-long conference of the largest public and political 
organization of the Mongolian Democratic Union [name of 
organization as received] has been finished here and heated 
debates being launched but the conference has not resulted in 
great changes in the composition of the leadership. 
  Leader of the Mongolian Democratic Union has remained T. 
Elbegdorj who has been relieved recently of the duties of a 
member of the parliament according to his own request. After 
April's political hunger strike being arranged with the purpose 
of having the government (?resign) according to a number of 
members of the union, the prestige of the organization has 
undermined and there is necessity for renewing the activities of 
the organization. For this aim there has been set up a group 
for renovation of the activities of the Mongolian Democratic 
Union. Apparently the initiative group and its supporters 
failed to have T. Elbegdorj and some other members of the board 
having been viewed to be the major instigators of the hunger 
strike entailing the undermining of the authority of the 
Mongolian Democratic Union, replaced during the work of the 
conference.

<F P=106> [Report by Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Dey Eth, Cambodia, June 22 (AFP) -- A government 
amnesty programme for Khmer Rouge [KR] defectors is losing 
appeal with guerrillas and numbers are declining sharply, former 
guerrillas said Wednesday. 
  Ex-Khmer Rouge fighters spend eight to 10 weeks at this 
military-run re-education camp just east of the capital before 
graduating with the offer of a post, and possible promotion, in 
the Cambodian army. 
  Some 600 defectors finished the first course of re-education 
in November but the figure was down to 198 in May and only 51 
former guerrillas are currently enrolled. 
  Much of the initial success of the programme was attributed 
to heavy publicity. 
  Co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen made 
regular 
public appeals for guerrillas to defect and helicopters 
air-dropped leaflets with the same message into Khmer 
Rouge-controlled zones. 
  Defectors at the camp, however, said that while they were 
still attracted by the government's call for national 
reconciliation, the centre itself had acquired a bad reputation. 
  "We heard that people were not treated well by the military 
in the camp," one defector said, adding that some guerrillas had 
escaped back to the jungle and advised their comrades not to 
enroll. 
  A human rights organisation which investigated the programme 
said it had been "marred by corruption involving top army 
commanders and cases of ill-treatment," but camp commandant 
General Say Khon dismissed the criticisms as outdated. 
  "We did have complaints of bad treatment, fake defectors and 
corruption earlier, but since the end of the first course we 
have had no problems," he said. 
  "The programme is going well," he added, but declined 
comment 
on the allegation that the number of defectors is down sharply. 
  Defectors agreed that there were no longer any cases of 
serious ill-treatment but they complained of strict discipline 
and few perks. 
  "We have no money even to buy cigarettes. Life in the jungle 
was easier than this," a former guerrilla said. 
  The programme ran into controversy soon after the first 
re-education course started and it was discovered that several 
hundred participants were only pretending to be Khmer Rouge. 
  Civilians and demobilised soldiers had bribed corrupt army 
officers or middlemen to be enrolled as Khmer Rouge defectors in 
the hope of landing a job with the national army. 
  A number of the imposters complained to human rights groups 
of beatings and other humiliating punishments and more than 200 
men, including several genuine guerrillas, later escaped. 
  The programme was further discredited in January when a 
Khmer 
Rouge division commander, his deputy and some 92 other defectors 
were expelled as imposters. 
  "Most of them were real Khmer Rouge and felt betrayed. They 
returned to the forest and rejoined the Khmer Rouge," said a 
human rights official who asked not to be identified. 
  The programme now holds so little attraction that most Khmer 
Rouge who want to defect simply slip away quietly or surrender 
to local authorities, a defector said. 
  "Most would prefer to return to their villages and families. 
Only those who have no alternative come here," he said. The 
Khmer Rouge control some 10 to 15 per cent of the country and 
continue to wage a guerrilla war against the government 
installed following last year's UN-supervised polls. 
  Although government officials say some 3,000 guerrillas have 
defected since the amnesty programme started, the Khmer Rouge 
have still caused significant battlefield upsets for the 
government forces. 
  The radical faction is also on a recruitment drive to 
further 
boost the strength of their forces, government officials said 
recently.

<F P=106> [Station editorial: "A Diplomat in Phnom Penh Says Cambodia, </F>
Which is Facing All Kinds of National and Social Problems, Is in 
Urgent Need of Political Reform"] 
  [Text] Recently, an Asian diplomat, who asked to remain 
anonymous, said that the Cambodian people under the government 
of the two prime ministers are suffering in all aspects due to 
national and social problems. The situation in Cambodia remains 
serious, despite the fact that the UNTAC [UN Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia] spent $2 billion to remedy it. War has 
continued, and nothing has been resolved. More aggressor 
Vietnamese forces have continued to flow into Cambodia. 
Meanwhile, the government with two prime ministers has 
continued to provoke the war, attacking the people and patriotic 
forces. The meager sum of foreign financial aid has been spent 
on the military and war operations. Therefore, no efforts for 
national reconstruction have been made. Even roads in Phnom 
Penh have not been repaired. 
  The economy does not exist because all the money has been 
drained by the war. The people are displaced, thus they have no 
chance to be productive. Some areas that could produce a small 
amount could hardly meet their own need. This is why there are 
no products for export in exchange for foreign currency. The 
officials in the government with two prime ministers are very 
corrupt. 
  This diplomat added that there are currently internal rifts 
within the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]. They oppose Prince 
Ranariddh, who has pursued a dictatorial policy and associated 
himself with the Cambodian People's Party [CPC] and especially 
with Hun Sen. Ranariddh does not listen to anyone. He listens 
only to the orders of the United States, France, Australia, and 
particularly the communist Vietnamese through Hun Sen, Sar 
Kheng, and Chea Sim. This is why, although the communist 
Vietnamese have moved the border markers 20 to 30 kilometers 
inside Cambodia, Ranariddh has said nothing. 
  Due to these national and social problems, the people of all 
circles are very worried about the fate of the nation and 
people. Therefore, there have been demands that power be given 
to King Norodom Sihanouk for a few years so that he can settle 
national problems by forming a national salvation government 
with the king as the prime minister and four deputy prime 
ministers, namely, Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen, (?Sam Rangsi), and 
Khieu Samphan. Only by so doing can the serious national and 
social problems be resolved.

  [Text] Press communique: A plenary session of the cabinet 
was held at 1500 on the afternoon of 18 June under the 
chairmanship of Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech 
Hun Sen, first and second prime ministers of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia [KOC] to examine the investment bill. After a thorough 
debate, the cabinet ratified this investment bill which has 
eight chapters and 26 articles. 
  The cabinet commended the experts for skillfully drafting 
the 
bill which has contents suitable for the urgent requirements of 
the nation and domestic and foreign investment. 
  The cabinet paid attention to discussing and improving the 
draft to attract investments to the KOC, thus creating and 
increasing jobs for the people and enhancing the production in 
the following domains: 
  I. Concerning Chapter II dealing with the Cambodian 
Development Council [CDC], the cabinet unanimously regarded the 
CDC as the general staff of the Royal Government of Cambodia 
[RGC] in investment work and the competent body which has sole 
access to the issuance of investment permits. At the same time, 
the cabinet agreed on the protection of investors' rights and 
freedoms. The arrangement, function, and composition of the CDC 
will be set by a sub-decree. 
  II. Concerning Chapter III dealing with the investment 
guarantees, the RGC recognizes all investors equally, that is, 
there will be no discrimination based on their nationality and 
race. The RGC guarantees that it will not nationalize the 
assets of the investors and ensures that it will not control 
prices of products and services, except for public services and 
provisions in the books of charge, and will permit the right to 
purchase and transfer foreign currencies. 
  III. Concerning Chapter IV dealing with the incentives for 
investment, the priority domains to be encouraged are as follows: 
  1. Modern or high-technology industries. 
  2. Investment projects that are labor intensive, 
including those in tourism, the industries, and agriculture. 
  3. Projects to enhance the export or production of 
import- substitutes, agro-industrial projects, and projects in 
the processing industry. 
  4. Projects for the development of the provinces and 
countryside, the physical infrastructure, and the sustainable 
energy production located in special development zones. 
  Tax and duty incentives are as follows: 
  A corporate tax rate of nine percent; a corporate tax 
holiday 
of up to eight years depending on the characteristics of each 
investment project, whose order of priority will be determined 
by the RGC in a sub-decree; tax exemption on all reinvested 
profits; 100-percent tax exemption on goods for export; 
100-percent tax exemption on the import of goods to serve 
investments, to serve projects whose 80 percent of their 
production is exported, to serve projects in the tourist 
industry, labor-intensive industry, processing industry, 
agro-industry, or projects located in the special industrial 
zones; and permission to bring into the kingdom foreign 
supervisors, specialists, technicians, specialized workers, and 
their dependents in line with the KOC's immigration law. 
  IV. Concerning Chapter V dealing with ownership and use of 
land, in keeping with the Constitution there is no problem of 
land ownership for investors who are either physical or juristic 
persons with Cambodian nationality (meaning, those with more 
than 50 percent of their gross capitals belonging to 
Cambodians). As for foreign physical and juristic persons, they 
are allowed to use land through a long-term lease of up to 70 
years. This land use, including all the rights of land 
ownership, must be implemented in accordance with the law. 
  V. Also on that occasion, the cabinet agreed that individual 
disputes will be settled first by the CDC before being forwarded 
to court. Also, any disputes with the authorities concerned 
will be sent to ICSID [International Center for Settlement of 
Investment Disputes]. 
  The implementation of this investment law will be based on 
the publication of several subsequent royal decrees, 
sub-decrees, and regulations. However, this law will not affect 
investors who have been operating before it takes effect. 
  The cabinet ended its session at 2000 in an atmosphere of 
unity and with high sense of responsibility.

  [Summary] The Trade Ministry has reported that Singapore 
is currently Cambodia's most important trade partner. Up to 40 
percent of all imported goods on sale in Cambodian markets are 
from Singapore, which also tops the list of countries bringing 
in major goods such as oil worth around 350 millions dollars 
[currency not further specified]; around 20 millions dollars 
worth of construction materials; and several other millions of 
dollars worth of fabrics, television sets, video machines, and 
other consumer goods. After Singapore, Vietnam brings in about 
20 percent of all goods, the most expensive of which is oil. 
  Apart from these two countries, which hold 60 percent of the 
Cambodian market, there is Thailand. Imported Thai goods 
include construction materials, cement, iron bars, fabrics, 
canned food, and other consumer goods. Imported goods also come 
from Japan, Hong Kong, the PRC, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Cambodian 
goods make up only 10 percent of the market; they include fish, 
meat, vegetables, rice, and a small quantity of handicraft items. 
  According to the Trade Ministry, Cambodia exports only four 
goods: natural rubber, aquatic products, soybean, and sawn wood. 
The latter has been banned by the government since April. Other 
agricultural products have been exported but so far only 
surreptitiously. The authorities therefore are not yet in a 
positon to check the volume of these goods and cannot yet 
include them on the export list. 
  Some economists have predicted that Cambodia could export a 
lot of agricultural products if security is not a major problem 
for farmers.

  [Summary] So Khun, state secretary of the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry, recently said that the ministry 
plans to set up the first phase of a rural telecommunications 
network in a number of districts in Battambang Province. 
  The plan is based on an aid of 5 millions German marks from 
the German Government to the Royal Government of Cambodia to 
develop telecommunications in rural areas. The plan is for a 
wireless telecommunications network linking the provincial seat 
and a number of districts. The modern network will be set up in 
densely populated townships for use by the public for an 
appropriate fee. If everything proceeds according to plans, this 
network can be expanded by early 1995 to Mongkolborei District 
in Banteay Meanchey Province. 
  The minister also said that this plan will be implemented by 
the end of this year at the latest. Studies by German 
technicians and those from the ministry were completed a few 
months ago.

  [Text] Dr. Beddu Amang, the vice chairman of the National 
Logistics Agency (Bulog), said in answer to questions from the 
press recently that Indonesia has no intention at all to stop 
its import of wheat from the United States. But, Indonesia had 
not imported the commodity from that country under a commercial 
basis for the last two years due to the relatively-higher price 
reason. "That's normal in trade to postpone an import from 
other countries because of its unreachness [as published]," he 
said. 
  The Bulog vice chairman said that the postponement of 
Indonesia's wheat was done only because of its relatively higher 
price in a comparison to the wheat import from Argentina and 
Australia. "From the commercial points of view, we saw that the 
U.S. wheat import was not competitive in the market," he 
reiterated. 
  Moreover, he added Indonesia has requested the U.S. 
Government to consider the EEP (export enhancement program) to 
Indonesia for its import of the U.S. wheat. "I hope that the 
request can be understandably approved by the U.S. Government, " 
he said, revealing that it is directed to improve the future of 
the Indonesian people. 
  The Bulog vice chairman explained that due to the 
uncompetitive price, Indonesia has asked the U.S. Government for 
the EEP treatment also imposed to its wheat import similar to 
other developing countries such as Bangladesh. [sentence as 
published] However, he said, the request has not yet been 
accepted yet. 
  So far, Indonesia has imported its wheat needs from the 
United States both under the commercial and GSM (general sale 
manager) 102 3-year-term credit schemes. Last year, Indonesia 
imported wheat grains from the United States under the GSM 102 
basis amounting to 40,000 tons. During the same period, 
Indonesia's total import for the commodity reached 2.5 million 
tons. 
  Dr. Beddu Amang said that due to the relatively-higher price 
reason of the U.S. wheat in the market, the Indonesian 
Government has taken into consideration a conversion of its 
sources of the commercial wheat imports from the United States 
to other countries, including Argentina and Australia. 
Indonesia has also commercially imported the commodity from its 
fellow developing countries. 
  The price of wheat imports from Argentina and Australia has 
been about U.S. $170 per ton, whilst its US price is relatively 
more expensive. "Really," he said, "although the price is 
already calculated under the GSM 102 scheme, but its figure is 
still higher," Dr. Beddu Amang said, revealing that the price 
difference can reach up to around U.S. $20 per ton. 
  In the current 1994 fiscal year, Indonesia received an 
assistance under the GSM 102 scheme from the United States 
amounting to U.S. $165 million, out of which U.S. $20 million 
had been allocated for wheat imports from that country, while, 
the remaining amount was for other commodities, including 
protein meals, soybeans, and raw cotton.

  [Text] Speaking to newsmen in Jakarta today, Hun Sen, 
second prime minister of Cambodia, reiterated that the Phnom 
Penh government will not hold further negotiations with the 
Khmer Rouge [KR] because it has used all the topics discussed 
between the two sides at past talks as a platform to support its 
existence. 
  He said the failure of the talks between the Phnom Penh 
government and the Khmer Rouge faction in Pyongyang recently was 
due to the fact that the Khmer Rouge put forward proposals that 
did not totally lend support to the integrity of Cambodia. The 
Khmer Rouge asked for self-rule, which is impossible for the 
Phnom Penh government to accept. 
  Meanwhile, on a separate occasion, Prince Ranariddh, first 
prime minister of Cambodia, reiterated the Phnom Penh 
government's wish to open a Cambodian Embassy in Jakarta as soon 
as possible. According to Ranariddh, this will intensify 
efforts to step up bilateral economic and trade ties with 
Indonesia. He said that the Phnom Penh government has worked 
out several incentives to attract foreign investment in Cambodia.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Jun 21 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Cambodia wants 
to learn about reorganizing its armed forces and dealing with 
separatist movements by studying Indonesia's own experiences of 
post-independence restructuring, said Minister/State Secretary 
Murdiono. [passage omitted] 
  On the possibility of Cambodia joining the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Ranariddh said that the issue 
is still being debated. 
  He said that he has received strong support from some ASEAN 
member countries. 
  When asked whether or not Cambodia will attend the ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF) meeting in Thailand next year, the prime 
minister simply said that his country has clearly expressed its 
interest in attending the meeting. 
  "We have support from Indonesia and Malaysia. I do not know 
about the other countries such as the Philippines," he said. 
  "But, I should say that we have not yet received an answer 
from the host country (Thailand) about our attending the ARF," 
he added. 
  The Cambodian co-prime ministers and their entourage are 
scheduled to visit the Indonesia Aircraft Industry (IPTN) and 
the Asia-Africa Museum in Bandung on Wednesday.

  [Excerpt] A press statement released by the State 
Secretariat in Jakarta today said that Indonesia and Cambodia 
have agreed to expand their bilateral cooperation in the fields 
of trade, economy, education, and culture. The statement also 
said that an accord on bilateral economic and technical 
cooperation has been signed between the two countries during the 
current visit to Indonesia by the Cambodian co-prime ministers. 
The accord marks a new era in bilateral relations between 
Indonesia and Cambodia because the current bilateral cooperation 
has focussed only on political matters. 
  Meanwhile, the Phnom Penh government expressed its 
appreciation for Indonesia's vigorous efforts in leading the 
Nonaligned Movement (NAM). Cambodia is optimistic that the NAM 
will be successful under the chairmanship of Indonesia. 
  Today, the Cambodian co-prime ministers Norodom Ranariddh

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister/State Secretary Murdiono, 
while defending the record of President Suharto's New Order 
government, agreed yesterday that the time has come for 
Indonesia to adopt a more open political system. 
  Any political system must be dynamic and open to change in 
accordance with the demands of the situation and the conditions 
of the time, Murdiono said in a seminar to review the 
performance of the New Order government. 
  "It is a fact that the global political trend demands 
greater 
political openness and greater respect for human rights. These 
clearly must be taken into consideration," he said at the 
seminar organized by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). 
  "We already have laid the basis for a more open political 
format that also gives more respect to human rights," he said, 
referring to the 1993-98 State Policy Guidelines endorsed by the 
People's Consultative Assembly last year. 
  During the ensuing discussion, Murdiono said he was 
concerned 
that the political openness now being pursued by the government 
had been misinterpreted by some people. 
  The government, he said, is advocating transparency, which 
is 
not the same as being completely open. 
  The main difficulty in the move towards greater openness is 
in ensuring that it does not lead to anarchy, he said, stressing 
that all parties must treat the issue with responsibility. 
  Murdiono was the last speaker of the two-day LIPI seminar 
that was held in memory of the late Alfian, a political thinker 
who analyzed the New Order administration extensively during his 
lifetime. 
  The phrase New Order describes the successive 
administrations 
of President Suharto, who has ruled the nation since 1966. The 
period between independence in 1945 and 1965 under president 
Sukarno is described as the Old Order. 
  Murdiono said it was during the New Order era that the 
country for the first time managed to establish the frame of 
reference upon which the political system is built. This is 
based on Pancasila, the state ideology, and the Constitution. 
  During Sukarno's time the nation went from one upheaval to 
another as it experienced various political systems which were 
alien to Indonesia. 
  Murdiono posed the question whether he thought the political 
format of the New Order government has been successful and 
whether it was consistent with the 1945 Constitution. "Without 
doubt, I will answer yes," he said. 
  The minister also said that some of the credit, but not all, 
for the political concepts developed during the New Order should 
go to the Armed Forces (ABRI) for playing its political role 
through its "Dual-Function" doctrine in defense and politics. 
  "It cannot be denied that these concepts had military 
connotations," said Murdiono, a retired army lieutenant general 
who has spent most of his public career in civilian clothes. 
  He said ABRI would be the first to acknowledge that it is 
only a part of the national power, and that it sees its task as 
helping to develop the other potentials. "Through this point of 
view, it is natural that the military is directly or indirectly 
concerned with the national development." 
  Murdiono said the military never claimed all the credit for 
the achievements of the New Order. "A phenomenon which will be 
politically interesting to analyze is that despite its major 
political role, ABRI's budget is one of the smallest. It is 
even more interesting that ABRI's leadership have calmly 
accepted this."

  [Text] The Central Executive Council members of the 
Indonesian Journalists Association [PWI] said they fully 
understand the government's reasons for revoking the publication 
permits of two magazines, namely, TEMPO, EDITOR and a tabloid 
paper DETIK. 
  In a statement released in Jakarta today, the PWI Central 
Executive Council noted the several warnings issued earlier by 
the government to these three publications. The statement was 
signed by Tony Hadi and Tribuana Said, PWI's secretary general 
and chairman respectively. 
  The PWI Central Executive Council is confident that this 
incident will not cause the active participation of the press in 
national development to slacken and it will not dampen the 
spirit of openness between government officials and the people.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 22 (ANTARA) -- The Indonesian 
Journalist Association (PWI) expressed its concern over the 
revocation of the leading weekly-magazine TEMPO, EDITOR and the 
tabloid DETIK. 
  PWI said in its press release -- issued here on Wednesday -- 
that it can understand the government's reasons in cancelling 
the license of the three publications. 
  The press release, which was signed by its chairman Tribuana 
Said, and secretary general Parni Hadi, noted that it believes 
the revocation will not slacken the participation of the 
Indonesian press in the national development and dampen the 
openness spirit among the public. 
  The journalist association also proposed to the government 
to 
issue new licences for the three publications as soon as 
possible so that journalists of the three media can have their 
jobs. 
  It called on the government and the public to go through 
legal mechanism or the press organization mechanism in handling 
cases concerning the press itself. 
  It believes that revocation of publications licenses will 
not 
happen if such mechanisms are followed. 
  Meanwhile, the Indonesian Newspapers Association (SPS) has 
also expressed its concern over the revocation. 
  The press release, which was signed by its chairman Jakob 
Utama and secretary A. Bagyo Purwanto, said that the revocation 
should remind the press society that the implementation of the 
principles of "positive interaction between the press, the 
government and the public" did not yet function well.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto, acknowledging 
the Indonesian Navy's needs to bolster its fleet to defend the 
archipelago's vast waters, says it still has to operate within 
the budget. 
  Suharto however gave his full endorsement to the plan to 
develop a navy base in Teluk Ratai on the southern tip of 
Sumatera by making a visit there yesterday. 
  The project has been mentioned as a candidate for the 
government axe as the Ministry of Finance and the Agency for the 
Research and Application of Technology (BPPT) is now haggling 
over the budget for the Navy's ambitious development plan. 
  "I fully support the development of the main base in Teluk 
Ratai," Suharto said during a visit to the site yesterday to 
launch the project. He said that given the government's budget 
constraints, the base should be developed in phases. 
  The President, speaking without a text, stressed that the 
Navy, and the Armed Forces (ABRI) for that matter, must fall in 
line with the government's development program which puts 
emphasis on improving the welfare of the people. 
  The Ministry of Finance has slashed the navy's proposal for 
a 
$1.1 billion budget to finance the purchase and refitting of 39 
second hand warships from Germany. The budget includes spare 
parts and ammunition, as well as for the construction of Teluk 
Ratai base which will house some of these ships. 
  It has imposed a limit of $320 million for the entire 
package, ordering the navy to scale down their plans. The BPPT, 
which has been appointed to handle the procurement, said it 
could only bring the figure down to $482 million. 
  In the original budget proposal, the Teluk Ratai project was 
to cost US$151 million. This item was excluded from the latest 
proposal from BPPT. 
  The haggling between Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad and 
State Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie became 
public knowledge when the two were questioned in separate 
hearings at the House of Representatives on Tuesday. 
  Suharto in his speech stressed that a strong Armed Forces is 
crucial for Indonesia to safeguard the fruits of development. 
He acknowledged that strengthening the Indonesian Navy is a 
costly venture yet emphasized that the nation needs a dependable 
force to protect its territorial waters. 
  The German warships comprising 16 corvettes, 19 tank landers 
and nine minesweepers, come from the former arsenal of East 
Germany. They are being earmarked to replace about 40 of the 80 
aging ships now being operated by the navy. 
  Suharto yesterday defended Habibie from criticism of the way 
he has handled the procurement, saying that he personally asked 
the minister to handle the negotiations because he was familiar 
with German officials and industrialists. 
  "We shouldn't make a big issue out of his appointment. 
Certainly it was not because we didn't trust the officers in 
the Ministry of Defense and Security or in ABRI." 
  He recalled that the idea to buy the ships first came from a 
private entrepreneur but he subsequently backed out after 
finding that there would be no commission from the deal. That's 
when Habibie was asked to step in. 
  He stressed that the ships were sold at bargain prices even 
after the additional costs of refitting them were included. 
  The President warned that the controversy over the 
procurement of the warships was fanned by people who had little 
knowledge about the issue. 
  "They aired their views, further muddling the situation, set 
one official against another, sowed mistrust between them to the 
point of disrupting stability," he said. "We won't let them get 
away. We will warn them, and if that doesn't stop them, we'll 
take firm action." 
  He stressed that this had nothing to do with freedom of 
speech, which is guaranteed by the constitution. "There are 
laws on how to exercise this right, and any violation should be 
punished." 
  Suharto, accompanied by Mrs. Tien Suharto, also went on 
board 
the KRI [Republic of Indonesia Ship] Teluk Banten, one of the 17 
warships from Germany that had been delivered. From the ship, 
they witnessed 23 of the navy's ships pass by. 
  Suharto also witnessed the presentation of five of the 
German 
ships from Habibie to Minister of Defense and Security Edi 
Sudrajat, who in turned handed them over to Navy Chief of Staff 
Admiral Tanto Kuswanto.

  [Text] Ambyo Mangunwijaya, president director of the 
state-run Bukit Asam Coal Mining Company, said Indonesia, with 
coal export figures of 20 million tons in 1993, has become the 
world's third largest coal exporter. 
  He said that the constant boosting of production would also 
increase Indonesia's coal exports, which may reach 40 million 
tons by the end of the current Sixth Five-year Development Plan 
(Pelita VI) in 1999. 
  According to Ambyo Mangunwijaya, by the conclusion of Pelita 
VI, Indonesia's coal output is projected to increase to 71 
million tons per year, of which 31 million tons are for domestic 
consumption and 40 million tons for export. 
  To boost production, the Bukit Asam Coal Mining Company has 
entered into cooperation with a number of mining contractors, 
both local and foreign.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 22 (ANTARA) -- The government has 
appealed to the farmers not to hold back their rice stocks 
because the government is constantly in need of rice in 
substantial quantities to maintain stability, State Minister 
Ibrahim Hasan told the press here on Wednesday. 
  The state minister for food affairs /chairman of the 
national 
logistics agency made these remarks after giving an account of 
the development of the national food stock to President Suharto 
at the Merdeka [Presidential] Palace. 
  Minister Ibrahim Hasan said that the food stock controlled 
by 
the government reached at present 700,000 to 900,000 tonnes, but 
it will continue to increase until it reached the safe level of 
1.2 to 1.3 million tonnes. 
  The government will continue to purchase rice not only to 
meet the people's demand but also to prevent a negative impact 
of the dry season, he added. 
  The Central Bureau of Statistics has predicted that the dry 
season this year will cause a reduction of 2.7 per cent in the 
production of rice. 
  Indonesia's demand for rice each year reaches about 2.5 
million tonnes. 
  The minister said that although rice production declined, 
the 
government had no intention whatsoever to import this commodity. 
  Although Indonesia will not commercially import rice, but it 
will receive 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of rice in the next few 
months as reimbursements of the rice lent by Indonesia to 
several countries, including the Philippines. 
  The minister also reported about the result of the recent 
meeting of 16 ministers in the fields of agriculture and food in 
Montevideo, Uruguay, discussing the implementation of the 
Uruguay Round which was ratified in Morocco recently. 
  One of the items discussed at the meeting was the 
abolishment 
of subsidies on agricultural produce which have so far been 
provided by advanced as well as developing countries. 
  Commenting on the result of the meeting, the head of state 
said that Indonesia should constantly implement the Uruguay 
Round decisions, however with taking the national interest into 
consideration. 
  "We should always give priority to the national production 
and imports only as complementary", Minister Ibrahim Hasan said, 
quoting the president. 
  He also stressed that Indonesia would fulfilled its 
obligation to import 70,000 tonnes of rice, although it would 
only be implemented early in 1995.

  [Text] A ceremony was held at the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry in Vientiane yesterday to sign a protocol on 
agricultural development cooperation between the Government of 
the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and the DPRK 
Government in accordance with the primary agreement signed in 
Vientiane on 6 June by the high-level leaders of the two 
countries. 
  Phimpha Thepkhamheuang, deputy minister of agriculture and 
forestry, and (Kim Chik-suk), respectively representing the LPDR 
and DPRK Governments, signed the protocol in the presence of the 
representatives of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Prime 
Minister's Office, and many technical authorities concerned from 
the two sides. 
  The protocol designated some areas to conduct agricultural 
development programs and experimental studies to find proper 
technical methods in planting crops and raising livestock for 
commercial purposes. The experimental work will be jointly 
carried out by the two sides on four locations covering an area 
of 11 hectares within a period of five years, namely a 
five-hectare plot at Latsen in Xieng Khouang Province and three 
plots in Vientiane Province -- a one-hectare plot at the Naphok 
Seeds Experimental Center, a one-hectare plot at the Hatdokkeo 
Agricultural Center, and a four-hectare plot at the Salakham 
Agricultural Promotion Unit. New techniques and rice-planting 
machines will be used on an experimental basis to raise rice 
production efficiency up to the level achieved by the DPRK, 
which is capable of producing between eight to 12 metric tons of 
paddy per one hectare.

  [Text] Laos appears to be hastening its pace to develop a 
large number of power plants with an aim to export the bulk of 
their output to meet Thailand's explosive energy demand. 
  Vientiane has so far signed memorandums of understanding 
with 
international consortia to establish 13 power generation 
projects in Laos with a combined generating capacity of more 
than 4,000 megawatt (MW), a capacity which satisfies nearly half 
of Thailand's current power demand. 
  Khammon Phonkeo, Laos' vice minister of Industry and 
Handicraft told the Business Post in Bangkok that 12 of the 13 
projects are hydroelectric stations and one is an indigenous 
lignite-based station. 
  The Laotian Government's decision to proceed with so many 
projects is largely influenced by indications from Thai energy 
planners that the Kingdom would be able to increase power 
purchases beyond the 1,500 MW contained in the memorandum of 
understanding the two governments signed last June. 
  Due to the explosive growth in Thai power demand, now 
increasing at roughly 10 percent a year, there is a strong 
possibility that the Kingdom could buy up 4.000 MW of 
electricity in the period between 2000-2010, according to the 
Laotian minister. 
  Thailand's power demand in the current 7th Plan was 
anticipated to grow from 9,000 MW in 1992 to 13,009 MW in the 
year 2000, representing an average annual growth of 10.9 percent 
or 992.8 MW. 
  However, Laos is expected to be able to supply only 1,600 MW 
to Thailand in the year 2000 because some projects would not be 
on line by that time, Mr Khammon said. 
  Four out of 13 projects are in the preparation stage of 
construction. They are the Nam Theun Hin Boun, Nam Theun II, 
Houai Ho and Hongsa, which is lignite-fired. 
  The four projects are more committed in the advanced stage 
than other projects whose feasibility studies still need to be 
conducted. Most of them involve Thai investors. 
  The majority of output from all the power projects in Laos, 
in which the Laotian Government has certain stakes, will be 
exported to Thailand. 
  However, Mr Khammon said it is possible to export some of 
the 
power to neighbouring countries like China, Burma, Vietnam, 
Cambodia and Vietnam. 
  But agreement on the power price with the Thai authorities 
will be crucial in determining whether all these Laotian power 
plants will get off the ground. 
  Mr Khammon is now leading the Laotian effort to negotiate a 
power sale agreement with the Electricity Generating Authority 
of Thailand (EGAT). 
  Current negotiations center on the power sale pacts for the 
210- MW Nam Theun Hin Boon scheme and the 600-MW Nam Theun II 
plan. The minister said talks on the Nam Theun Hin Boun is now 
at a much more advanced stage. 
  He is optimistic that an agreement for Nam Theun Hin Boun 
could be struck shortly, noting that the difference in prices 
both sides have asked were substantially narrowed. 
  In another development, EGAT yesterday won Cabinet approval 
to proceed with the 14.73-billion-baht investment plan to set up 
two large-scale power stations to be fuelled by indigenous 
natural gas. 
  One of the two projects is the 400-MW combined cycle power 
plant to be located in Nong Chok. Investment for this project 
is estimated at 6.52 billion baht. 
  The other, estimated to cost 3.52, billion baht, calls for 
the installation of a 200-MW power house in Sai Noi district of 
Nonthaburi.

in overcoming all difficulties and fulfilling national defense 
and public security maintenance tasks, and striving to 
consolidate themselves to become progressive in all fields. The 
comrade also noted developments in the current international and 
regional situations; the enemy's sinister designs against our 
country; and the party's current policies spelled out in the 
various resolutions adopted by the party, which must be 
profoundly appreciated and strictly implemented by the armed 
forces with a high sense of responsibility. In conclusion, 
Comrade Lt. Gen. Saman Vi-gnaket called on our Army to enhance 
its fine traditions actively; to fulfill the three-duty and 
four-relations tasks [not further specified] exceptionally; and 
to act as a progressive model in all four areas -- firmly 
grasping the party's policy, consistently maintaining the 
revolutionary line, pursuing correct behavioral patterns, and 
maintaining a clean and honest lifestyle.

  [Text] The meeting on national defense work and the 
consolidation and building of the armed forces for the first 
half of this year, held under the chairmanship of Comrade 
Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-gnason, Political Bureau member 
of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and 
national defense minister, has concluded with glorious success 
after five days of energetic work. 
  In his address reviewing the meeting's success, Comrade Lt. 
Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason hailed the high sense of 
responsibility displayed by all delegates in attendance. They 
diligently contributed views to the meeting's draft report 
reviewing national defense work in the first six months of this 
year as well as work orientations for the consolidation and 
building of the armed forces in the second half of the year. 
  The delegates unanimously assessed that despite numerous 
difficulties in the first half of 1994, our armed forces -- 
together with the multiethnic Lao people -- have managed to 
thwart every sinister scheme employed by bad elements, thereby 
keeping the situation basically peaceful throughout the country. 
Moreover, consolidation of the organizational, political, and 
ideological aspects of all Army units has also made firm 
progress. Firm economic foundations have been laid to improve 
the living conditions of all soldiers. 
  Despite these strong points, our armed forces are still 
encountering certain obstacles. Political training is still 
failing to catch up with political organization and practical 
deeds. The translation of the party's policies into reality has 
not yet been fully realized. A considerable number of cadres 
and party members have failed to set up model patterns and 
practical organizational methods to lead armed units in 
efficiently performing their work. Negativism still prevails 
among our cadres and combatants.

  [Text] Twenty-six people were killed in fierce gun battles 
in Basilan in Mindanao yesterday between government troops and 
the Moro bandit group, the Abu Sayyaf. Of the fatalities, 20 
were bandits and six were Marines of the Philippines Armed 
Forces. 
  The fierce gun battle took place as government troops 
assaulted the camp of the Abu Sayyaf on top of a hill in 
Isabela, Basilan. Marine officials said the bandits, who were 
positioned on the hill, opened fire at the soldiers pinned below. 
  The Marines decided to launch an assault on the Abu Sayyaf 
camp to free Catholic priest Father Cirilo Nacorda, being held 
hostage by the bandits. Negotiations for the release of Father 
Nacorda had broken down. The bandits held on to the priest 
after killing 15 people earlier this month. They released 57 
other hostages last week during the negotiations. Church 
officials fear that the bandits have already killed Nacorda 
following the bombardment of the Abu Sayyaf camp. The bandits 
have threatened to kill the priest if their camp was attacked. 
  In Manila, Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Arturo 
Enrile gave the Marines 48 hours to capture the Abu Sayyaf camp. 
Enrile brushed aside criticisms that the military was making an 
overkill by deploying about 2,000 troops backed by heavy 
artillery and aerial attack. He said superior force was needed 
to overcome the advantage of the Abu Sayyaf, who had been well 
entrenched and were familiar with the rugged terrain.

  [Text] Tatsuro Toyoda (president of Toyota Motor 
Corporation), chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, in a news conference on 21 June once again voiced 
his objection to insistence by the U.S. on setting numerical 
targets in the auto sector, saying, "My understanding is that it 
was agreed in the Japan-U.S. government-level talks not to 
discuss numerical targets." This remark was made in reference to 
the position of Andrew Cardo [name as published], managing 
director of the American Automobiles Manufacturers Association 
(AAMA), who emphasized the need for setting numerical targets in 
a meeting with Toyoda on 20 June. 
  Speaking about a proposal on making the number of imported 
car dealers an objective criteria between Japan and the United 
States, he noted there are differences in the form of dealers 
existing in Japan and the United States. He warned against the 
U.S. position, insisting, "We will have to have an agreement 
(with the United States) on what dealers are." 
  According to Chairman Toyoda, AAMA Managing Director Cardo 
paid a courtesy call on him on 20 June, and, on that occasion, 
expressed "a strong view in support of numerical targets," 
saying, "it is more convenient to have numerical targets to open 
up Japan's closed market." Chairman Toyoda told reporters, "We 
are against numerical targets, and I do not think the government 
agrees to them either." 
  Regarding the objective criteria as a way of gauging the 
degree of market openness of Japan, Chairman Toyoda said, "The 
definition of criteria is not clear. Even with respect to the 
question of how many dealers sell both domestic cars and 
imported cars, I personally think we will have to reach an 
agreement (with the United States) on what dealers are. For 
instance, one dealer has many stores in Japan, while most 
dealers have only one store each in the United States. 
  Meanwhile, regarding Japan's imports of auto parts from the 
United States, and in connection with the fact that it is 
becoming questionable if 1994's target of buying $19 billion 
worth of U.S. auto parts can be met, he avoided making a 
clear-cut comment, except to say, "With economic conditions 
changing, it is difficult to make a prediction. All companies 
are making considerable efforts." In 1993, 11 auto 
manufacturers in Japan imported $15.5 billion worth of U.S.-made 
products (14.1 percent more than in the preceding year). 
  Asked about the offensive regarding imported cars in the 
Japanese market, he confidently replied, "There is no fear of 
imported cars becoming a dominant force yet." On the question 
of expanding specifications for compact cars, he said, "We would 
like to reach a conclusion by the end of summer."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Motohiro Matsumoto] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 17 Jun -- The Toyota Motor Corporation 
will set cost-cutting targets for U.S. auto parts makers which 
have supplied auto parts to it. In Japan, automakers have 
always asked their keiretsu [affiliated subsidiaries] auto parts 
makers to reduce the cost of auto parts by setting numerical 
targets. So far, Japanese automakers have not set any 
cost-cutting targets for U.S. auto parts makers because of the 
need to place importance on improving the quality of U.S. auto 
parts. The automobile and auto parts sector has been one of the 
priority sectors at the Japanese- U.S. economic framework talks, 
and each Japanese automaker is in a hurry to expand its purchase 
of U.S.-made auto parts. The Toyota Motor Corporation intends 
to expand its purchase of U.S.-made auto parts by formulating a 
long-term tie-up with U.S. auto parts makers, like the one it 
has built in Japan. 
  The major Japanese automaker announced at an annual meeting 
of U.S. auto parts manufacturers held earlier this week in San 
Francisco that it would set the cost-reduction targets for U.S. 
auto parts suppliers. The cost-cutting targets vary from 
automaker to automaker, but each Japanese automaker sets them at 
2 percent a year or 5 percent over five years, and then asks its 
auto parts suppliers to meet these targets. Some Japanese 
automakers have already notified their auto parts suppliers of 
their targets. 
  In Japan, the formula has long been adopted whereby 
numerical 
targets are set for reductions in the cost along with 
improvements in the quality of auto parts, and automakers and 
auto parts makers work together to design auto parts and to 
choose materials with which to manufacture auto parts. Only 
some automakers have set numerical targets for cutting the 
prices of parts, but automakers have come to seek cost-cutting 
targets as the quality of auto parts has improved. 
  In March, the Toyota Motor Corporation announced plans to 
boost its combined purchases of U.S.-made auto parts -- which 
consist of imports and local purchase in the United States -- to 
$6.45 billion in 1996 (from April 1996 to March 1997), an 
increase of 38 percent over the total combined purchases in 
1993. The major Japanese automaker has judged that it is 
important to promote a long-term reduction in the cost and 
improvements in the quality of U.S.-made auto parts by adopting 
the Japanese-style keiretsu deal method to expand the purchase 
of U.S.-made auto parts. While U.S. automakers are criticizing 
the closed Japanese automobile and auto parts market, they are 
vigorously embracing the Japanese-style keiretsu method in a bid 
to bolster their competitiveness. Ford and Chrysler have 
already pressed their auto parts suppliers to cut the price and 
improve the quality of their parts. They have succeeded in 
improving their competitiveness in the cost and the quality of 
auto parts by strengthening their business ties with selected 
auto parts suppliers in the areas of development and production.

  [Text] Michio Watanabe, who is chairman of the Watanabe 
faction in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and 
former deputy prime minister, presented Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], on 18 June with a 
draft policy agreement and a blueprint for "a new coalition 
government to be formed mainly by conservatives and centrists." 
This has been disclosed by several members of the ruling 
coalition parties and a senior member of the Watanabe faction. 
The draft policy agreement and the blueprint for a new 
coalition government are that the LDP and Shinseito will reach a 
policy agreement, including the reform of the current tax 
system, to form a new coalition government, with the Japan New 
Party [JNP] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] participating 
in the new coalition government. The ruling coalition parties, 
former Prime Minister Nakasone, Watanabe, and some LDP members 
are making moves to forge a "conservative-conservative 
coalition," but, this is the first time that the specific 
blueprint for forming a new coalition government has come to 
light. Differences still remain between Watanabe and the ruling 
coalition parties over Watanabe's secession from the LDP, and it 
remains unclear whether the Watanabe-proposed blueprint will win 
much support or not. 
  As for Japan's diplomacy and security, the draft policy 
agreement notes that Japan should make aggressive contributions 
to UN peacekeeping operations (PKO) on the "basis of 
international pacifism." As for domestic policy, the draft 
policy agreement stresses the need to reform the current tax 
system as "one of the aggressive measures to prepare Japan for a 
society of senior citizens." 
  The blueprint for a new coalition government notes that: 1) 
The LDP and Shinseito will form a new coalition government with 
other parties that share their political beliefs and policies; 
2) the JNP and other parties which agree with their policies are 
urged to participate in the new coalition government; 3) the LDP 
and Shinseito will choose a candidate for prime minister; and 4) 
the coordination of views among parties for selecting candidates 
to run under the single-seat constituency system will be 
withheld for the time being. The blueprint does not mention the 
opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan. 
  Ozawa has a history of strongly backing Watanabe as a 
politician to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. Meanwhile, 
Nakasone has advocated the need to "rally conservative parties 
and centrist forces." Ozawa and Nakasone are said to have met 
secretly in late May to agree in principle on the need to rally 
the conservative parties and centrist forces, although they have 
denied that the secret meeting took place.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo ASAHI Newstar Television Network 
in Japanese at 1111 GMT on 19 June, in its regular "Sunday 
Project" program, carries a 45-minute discussion on the recent 
domestic political situation by Wataru Kubo, Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] secretary-general, and Kozo Watanabe, 
acting Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general, 
moderated by commentator Soichiro Tahara at the Asahi studio in 
Tokyo. 
  The discussion begins with Kubo explaining why his party 
decided to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to 
testify before the Diet regarding his money deals with the 
Sagawa Kyunbin Company. Tahara then asks Kubo about the present 
political situation and the SDPJ's stand on political 
realignment. Kubo says: "The Hata cabinet must resign en masse 
to clean up the root cause for the SDPJ leaving the coalition. 
If that condition is accepted, we will discuss ways to form a 
new administration." 
  When asked if there could be any other way to form a new 
administration other than the cabinet's resignation, Kubo says 
the SDPJ will not rule out the possibility of holding 
negotiations with the ruling parties to seek alternatives. 
Tahara asks if the SDPJ will ask Shinseito Secretary General 
Ozawa to assume responsibility for causing the SDPJ's 
withdrawal. Kubo says his party will not do that. 
  At 1124 GMT, Tahara asks Kubo about the possibility of his 
party submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata 
cabinet. Kubo replies the SDPJ will not submit such a motion 
now, while in the process of conducting negotiations with the 
ruling parties on forming a new cabinet. 
  Asked if there is a possibility of the SDPJ submitting a 
no-confidence motion in cooperation with the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] in the future, Kubo says: "It depends on future 
negotiations [with the ruling parties] on a new administration." 
When Tahara asks whether the SDPJ is willing to form even a new 
coalition with the LDP, Kubo says: "Yes." But he adds since the 
SDPJ cannot ally with the LDP in its present form, it wants to 
find a solution in the negotiations with the ruling parties. 
  At 1131 GMT, Shinseito's Watanabe arrives at the studio and 
joins the discussion. Watanabe also emphasizes the importance 
of the negotiations between the SDPJ and the coalition parties. 
  Asked to give his opinion on the SDPJ's demand for the 
cabinet's resignation, Watanabe says it might resign if it can 
assure the establishment of a stable and efficient 
administration. While noting the resignation is a decision only 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata can make, Watanabe says Hata will 
make a choice that can help improve Japanese politics. 
  Discussing the SDPJ's position on a no-confidence motion in 
the cabinet, Tahara notes the SDPJ wants the cabinet to 
voluntarily resign before such a motion is adopted. Kubo 
confirms his comment by saying: "That is right." 
  At 1137 GMT, Tahara asks Watanabe to explain the key points 
in negotiations with the SDPJ. Watanabe notes that the two 
sides need to agree on major policy issues and on the formation 
of a consultative panel. He adds it is possible for his party 
to advise Prime Minister Hata to have the cabinet resign if it 
feels sure it can contribute to establishing "new improved 
Japanese politics." 
  When Watanabe says a no-confidence motion should not be 
submitted without considering current political difficulties, 
Kubo reiterates it is unthinkable for the SDPJ to submit the 
motion while the negotiations are underway. 
  While admitting the ruling parties' responsibility for 
causing the SDPJ's withdrawal, Watanabe says: "We will take Mr. 
Kubo's call into consideration with as much modesty as possible 
to work out conditions for forming the next coalition 
administration." He adds this includes the Kata cabinet's 
resignation. 
  At 1145 GMT, Kubo leaves the studio and Tahara continues the 
discussion with Watanabe. Tahara points out differences in 
opinions within Shinseito over the future political realignment, 
citing Ozawa's plan to ally with the Watanabe and Yasuo Nakasone 
by forming a "conservatives' alliance with conservatives." 
Watanabe denies this: "I do not think Mr. Ozawa has such idea." 
He adds Ozawa is only trying to ally with LDP members who are 
determined to achieve political reform. Watanabe emphatically 
says the coalition administration's existing framework should be 
respected. 
  Tahara notes the cabinet's resignation is the only way to 
have the SDPJ return to the coalition. Watanabe says he will 
advise Ozawa and Hata that the resignation should be possible if 
it will assure unity within a coalition government.

  [Text] Chairmen of the Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations [Keidanren], the Japan Federation of Employers' 
Associations [Nikkeiran], the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry [Nissho], and the Japan Association of Corporate 
Executives [Keizai Doyukai] met for an hour at a Tokyo hotel in 
the morning of 21 June to exchange views on the political 
situation. During the meeting, the chairmen agreed on the point 
that dissolution of the House of Representatives and holding of 
general elections should be avoided. With regard to the 
question of when to hold general elections they expressed the 
view that "the general elections should be held under a new 
electoral system after a bill on demarcating the current 
constituencies is enacted in the Diet," and also confirmed that 
they would put forth the view as a consensus of the business 
community to both ruling and opposition parties. They released 
their views in the form of a document of agreement. The business 
leaders made clear their stance against assertions by the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Social 
Democratic Party of Japan that they would not hesitate to push 
for an early dissolution of the Lower House [LH] and an early 
holding of general elections. Their stance has attracted 
attention. 
  The meeting was held to congratulate Shoichiro Toyoda after 
he was named as the president of Keidanren, and to exchange 
views on the current political situation. Attending the meeting 
were Toyoda; Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren; Kosaku 
Inaba, chairman of Nissho; and Massaru Hayami, chairman of 
Keizai Doyukai. 
  The document of agreement released at the end of the meeting 
notes that "it is indispensable for Japan to push for political, 
administrative and economic reforms" to build itself into an 
affluent economic society in the 21st century, and urges the 
Diet to come to grips with these reforms. According to an 
attendee, Mr. Inaba said during the meeting "we must be cautious 
to make the expression of the document of agreement fair to both 
ruling and opposition parties." The four business leaders, 
however, agreed to incorporate in the document of agreement 
their opposition to dissolving the House of Representatives and 
holding general elections under the multi-seat constituency 
system. 
  In the past, the leaders of the four economic organizations 
regularly held such meetings to exchange views on the LDP 
leadership, but they have not held such a regular meeting since 
the coalition government came to office. The meeting held on 21 
June was the first ever since they met a year ago to discuss how 
to make political contributions in the closing days of the 
Miyazawa administration.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff writer Masao Kanazashi: "We Must </F>
Deal With the Quality of Politicians Before Addressing Policy 
Issues"] 
  [Text] Decline in Morality Has Led to Absence of Qualified 
Leaders 
  An unbelievable statement was uttered from within the Hata 
coalition government which faced imminent collapse owing to the 
withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from 
the coalition. 
  The origin of that statement was Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] Secretary General Ozawa who is considered to be the 
scenario writer of the series of political events. On the 
evening of 25 May amidst the controversy created by the 
withdrawal of the SDPJ, it was Ozawa who said, "What difference 
does it make as to which woman we sleep with?" in connection 
with the formation of the new faction called "Kaishin" 
[Innovation]. 
  As usual, he issued a denial via his secretary, stating, "I 
do not recall making the statement," but the truth of the 
statement is considered reliable in that several of the mass 
media have quoted the same words. Several female legislators 
protested the statement as being disrespectful of women and 
repercussions extended to foreign nations as reports on the 
incident were circulated internationally. 
  Some of the mass media did not cover the incident on the day 
the statement was made. It appears that they felt the statement 
was so unbecoming of a politician in a leadership position that 
they felt it would be inappropriate to mention it in a 
newspaper. However, an immutable rule is that statements made by 
people of importance are invariably quoted verbatim. 
  Needless to say, the Ozawa statement's impact was not 
limited 
to one of being disrespectful to women. Not only was his manner 
of speech so vulgar as to cause alarm as being like the 
poisonous words of a hooligan in the ghettos, but more 
importantly of concern is the political atmosphere that is so 
conducive to such expressions and the current situation under 
which Japanese politics is controlled by politicians who make 
complacent use of such language. 
  These are issues which are of more importance than policies 
or political techniques. Such utterances are tantamount to 
publicly confessing to the low quality and shabbiness of 
Japanese politics and they distance Japan from qualifying as a 
"dignified nation." If we were to refer to Mr. Ozawa's favorite 
term, "international contributions," there is no other 
conceivable deed that could do greater damage to Japan's honor 
or detract from international contributions. 
  The reason I decry so much Mr. Ozawa's utterance is that an 
individual's statements and manner of expression, on an 
empirical basis, serve to exemplify an individual's ideas and 
routine behavior. As an example, former Prime Minister Nakasone 
liked to use military terms for statements and fables, and some 
prime ministers referred immediately to the price when paintings 
were mentioned. 
  In terms of the status of politicians before considering any 
policy matters, there have been instances that we cannot help 
but question. It was just one month earlier that Mr. Kakizawa, 
as a representative of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, 
had demanded the resignation of the Hosokawa government, when 
suddenly he was appointed as the foreign minister of the Hata 
government. 
  Then, on the other hand, one day suddenly, Chairman Ouchi of 
the Democratic Socialist Party--who had allied himself with the 
Social Democrataic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake 
[Harbinger]--criticized the leadership style of Shinseito's 
Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa as being 
strong-armed, and betrayed Mr. Ozawa and became the ringleader 
in the SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition government. 
  Observing such events reminds one of the turbulent days of 
the feudal age, but many individual politicians, in reality, 
assess the current confusion arising from political change as a 
time of turbulence and try to navigate the rough waters in an 
effort to survive or further their careers. 
  Needless to say, politicians seek power in surviving the 
political carnage, but they also seem to find appeal in the 
authority that they display ostentatiously. 
  Announcements on the imperial awards issued in the spring 
were given only quiet coverage in the newspapers because they 
coincided with the installation of the Hata cabinet, but it was 
alarming that former Prime Minister Uno, who had resigned from 
his position after only three months because of a notorious 
womanizing incident, was being awarded a Grand Cordon of the 
Order of the Rising Sun Paulownia, First Class. It is not 
unusual for an individual with experience as a prime minister to 
receive a medal of the highest class, because awards are based 
on the rank of the public or private organizational position 
held and the length of service, but Prime Minister Uno's award 
looks awfully strange and even comical from a mundane 
perspective. 
  Political scandals of the past were normally concerned with 
dirty money or womanizing. However, the recent series of 
scandals have broken with past rules and common sense and are 
symptomatic of major changes in the political world and indicate 
that a process of self-destruction is currently in progress. 
  When one thinks of the truly irresponsible manner in which 
former Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned from office and Mr. 
Michio Watanabe's repeated contradictions of prior statements 
and threatened departure from the LDP, despite being a faction 
leader and former deputy prime minister, he can only conclude 
that there is a complete absence of or a radical change taking 
place among political leaders. The idea of a political 
reorganization is a good one, but there's no way that such a 
goal can be achieved in the absence of qualified key personnel.
