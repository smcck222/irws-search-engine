  [Text] In his lecture to students of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
Businessmen's College at a hotel in Makubari, Chiba city, Isao 
Ishizuka, Air Self-Defense Force chief of staff, touched on the 
issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons 
and said it is necessary to bring North Korea's past nuclear 
developments to light. Commenting on the U.S. Government's tilt 
toward freezing the DPRK's current nuclear program, he said: 
"My personal view is that freezing North Korea's nuclear 
program alone is not enough. As a neighboring nation of the 
DPRK, Japan will not be satisfied with freezing North Korea's 
nuclear program without verifying that country's past nuclear 
developments."

<F P=106> [Article by New York correspondent Yoshiharu Muto; sixth and </F>
last in a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected 
Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the 
International Community": "UN Arguments Over Sanctions"] 
  [Text] "The UN Security Council [UNSC] will function only 
until it adopts a resolution. After that, it will do nothing." 
Strangely, this rumor -- or jest -- is convincing. Of course, 
"after a resolution is adopted," the United Nations and its 
member nations will begin their struggles toward recruiting 
personnel to participate in peacekeeping activities, abiding by 
restrictions imposed by the resolution, and financial juggling 
to deal with steadily increasing expenses. However, as far as 
the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear program is concerned, 
it is before the resolution is adopted that diplomacy and 
politics can have their say. 
  In early June, a diplomatic source in New York said: "No 
nation wants to vote for a resolution to impose sanctions 
against North Korea. Everyone hopes to avoid it somehow. To 
tell you the truth, they are looking for ways to postpone 
adopting the resolution." 
  Truly, it remained unclear whether or not the UNSC would be 
able to adopt a resolution even when the United States proposed 
its draft sanctions resolution to UNSC member nations on 15 
June. China and Russia opposed the U.S.-proposed resolution, 
claiming they were not consulted about a ban on arms exports 
included in the resolution. Even if China abstains from voting 
and as a result, the resolution is adopted, the severe sanctions 
measure of halting remittances to the DPRK and the oil embargo, 
which is even more severe, would be thwarted. This is no 
surprise if remittances through a third country and the long 
PRC-DPRK border are taken into consideration. In short, it is 
possible that after adopting a resolution, the UNSC will realize 
that it has exhausted every means possible to resolve the 
nuclear issue, and that its chance to settle the issue occurred 
before adopting a resolution. 
  An official at the UN Administration Office said: "The UNSC 
is a place to discuss political matters, not an organization to 
carry out policies. Washington knows that sanctions against 
Iraq after the end of the Gulf war have not been carried out 
satisfactorily. The United States has proposed a 30-day grace 
period in its draft resolution. Also, unofficial negotiations 
before the adoption of a resolution will take up two or three 
weeks. These facts indicate that the United States is fully 
aware that political performance before the adoption of a 
resolution holds the key to resolving the nuclear issue." 
  There is another issue of concern. An opinion shared among 
Western nations' ambassadors to the United Nations is that 
Chinese and North Korean ambassadors to the United Nations "seem 
to have no right to decide, because they only repeat the same 
thing no matter how long we talk with them and no matter what we 
propose." Instead, they inform their home countries of the 
detailed moves of the United Nations. 
  In such a situation, the United States announced its draft 
resolution. Although for diplomatic reasons, Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, did not touch 
on the details of the resolution at a news conference in the 
United Nations, the full text of the resolution was disclosed by 
a British source a few hours later. It was just a couple of 
hours before former U.S. President Jimmy Carter began his first 
round of talks with North Korean President Kim Il-song. 
  Just a week before that event, Hisashi Owada, Japanese 
ambassador to the United Nations, said: "It is almost common 
knowledge in Japan that the sun is better than the north wind, 
as a tale from "Aesop's Fables" tells us. But in the 
international arena, the north wind is sometimes better than the 
sun." The United Nations will have to continue using a "carrot 
policy" and a "stick policy" by turns to resolve the nuclear 
issue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Us Nurture the Bud of Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] The issue of DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear 
arms development program has entered a new stage. As a result 
of talks between former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and DPRK 
President Kim Il-song, it has become likely that high-level 
U.S.-DPRK talks will be resumed. 
  Besides, an unexpected by-product was gained as ROK 
President 
Kim Yong-sam accepted DPRK President Kim Il-song's call for 
holding a summit meeting. It is still uncertain whether the 
summit will be realized or not, but if leaders of South and 
North Korea can hold a direct dialogue, it will definitely bring 
a historic turnabout in the Korean peninsula where the Cold War 
structure still persists. 
  Since North Korea announced its withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] has been hurrying to work out a sanctions 
resolution against this nation. The situation has been such 
that if the council had gone ahead with the resolution, distrust 
would have generated more trust, thus bringing about unexpected 
developments. 
  We welcome the fact that the tension in the Korean peninsula 
is easing for now and dialogue will resume. We strongly hope 
that North Korea will attend the high-level U.S.-DPRK talks with 
a sincere attitude to clear up the nuclear suspicion harbored by 
all nations. We also hope that the United States will make the 
most of this precious opportunity in finding a clue to a 
breakthrough in the situation through tenacious negotiations. 
  Carter said that Kim Il-song promised to freeze the nuclear 
development program on condition that the United States will 
agree to resume talks with the DPRK and also will render support 
in converting its [graphite] reactors into light water reactors. 
  President Kim is also supposed to have asked for assurances 
that the United States and other nations will not make North 
Korea their target of attack. This may indicate that North 
Korea is extremely anxious that it is continually exposed to the 
danger of a military attack. Nations isolating themselves from 
others tend to have such notions. 
  Carter made his visit to North Korea as a "private citizen." 
But his trip, which may bring a breakthrough to the situation, 
showed to the world how important it is to keep open the 
channels of dialogue no matter what happens. 
  Carter said he has received an invitation from President Kim 
several times since 1991. He is said to have made the visit at 
this time because confrontation over the nuclear suspicion was 
intensifying and, meanwhile, there was no direct dialogue with 
North Korea, which was the party involved. We would like to 
praise his insight and willingness to act. 
  President Bill Clinton has indicated that in principle, he 
will use the efforts made by the former president as a lead 
toward finding a solution to the issue. We think that is a good 
plan. We hope that the U.S.-DPRK working-level meeting, 
expected to be held early next week, will lead smoothly to 
high-level talks. 
  When looking back on the past, we realize that it is not 
easy 
to clear up nuclear suspicions. If North Korea truly does not 
have either nuclear weapons or intentions to build them, it 
should be able to accept full inspections to satisfy the 
international community. 
  Meanwhile, the United States on its part should suspend its 
current activities toward preparing for UNSC sanctions. China 
and Russia, which are UNSC members, were originally opposed to 
or skeptical about imposing sanctions immediately. In order to 
elicit a sincere attitude from North Korea and to have the 
international community united in dealing with the issue, we 
must follow the direction of the dialogue to resume soon. 
  As far as the South-North summit talks are concerned, we 
cannot make an optimistic prediction, since the holding of such 
talks has been called for by both nations several times in the 
past but has never been realized. But we would like to take 
both leaders' intentions to hold a direct dialogue at face value. 
  Hopefully, this bud of dialogue will be handled carefully 
and 
nurtured into full bloom.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 June Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The government and the Bank of Japan [BOJ] are 
deeply concerned the rapid appreciation of the yen may obstruct 
economic recovery. It wants to somehow change the yen 
appreciation trend. Since the present round of yen appreciation 
is considered to be of a mainly speculative nature, the BOJ will 
first continue its singlehanded intervention in the market, and 
call on the United States and other advanced nations to engage 
in a coordinated intervention. If the yen's appreciation 
continues, Japan plans to propose the issuance of an emergency 
statement saying: "The advanced nations' governments are 
concerned about the fluctuation in exchange rates." The 
government also believes that steady implementation of the 
economic measures previously decided upon, and further 
deregulation will also be necessary. 
  At a news conference on the evening of 22 June, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii said: "Japan has taken firm measures in 
the market, and will continue to do so." He admitted the 
government had decided to intervene in the Tokyo foreign 
exchange market on that day. 
  Regarding Japan's trade and current accounts surplus, which 
is behind the yen's appreciation, the Finance Ministry said: 
"There has been a clear declining trend in export volume, and 
imports will further increase with the economy's recovery." 
  However, the government and BOJ really have a limited number 
of options. The Finance Ministry and BOJ started to contact 
U.S. monetary authorities in the early hours of 22 June, but 
were apparently unable to convince the United States to agree to 
a coordinated intervention. The BOJ intends to continue lone 
efforts to sell yen and buy dollars. It will also continue to 
call on the U.S. authorities to engage in a coordinated 
intervention similar to that undertaken in early May.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Go For Policy Coordination Without Panicking </F>
Over '99 Yen' per Dollar; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 Jun 
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The yen's value against the dollar has reached the 
double-digit level for the first time in history. In the New 
York currency market on 21 June, the yen, for a while, was 
posted at 99 yen per dollar. This condition, however, is due 
less to an appreciation of the yen than to a depreciation of the 
dollar. The important thing at this time is not to panic at the 
historic rate of "99 yen" but to prepare conditions for policy 
coordinatioin to stop the dollar's sharp fall. 
  The dollar's decline against the mark and the yen is thought 
to have been caused by the outflow of funds invested in stocks 
and bonds as a result of growing investor apprehension that 
improved economic conditions in the United States might bring 
inflation to the U.S. market. Another reason is that the 
economies of Japan and Germany are starting to recover and the 
gap between them and the U.S. economy is narrowing. 
  The problem is that the dollar's fall will aggravate the 
market's apprehension about inflation, possibly raising U.S. 
long-term interest rates and inviting a fall in stock prices. 
The triple declines in value of the dollar, stocks, and bonds 
would impact the world, putting upward pressure on long-term 
interest rates throughout the world. It would also lead to 
falling stock prices. Such a chain of movements in the market 
would be amplified through a sharply expanded use of such 
financial derivatives (financially generated products) as 
futures and options. 
  Triggered by the fall in the dollar's value, long-term 
interest rates in various nations have already started to rise, 
and it is feared that this condition will have the effect of 
pouring cold water on the recent mood of the world economy 
recovering. Particularly with the yen reached an historic level, 
Japan's exporting companies are taking the situation seriously 
as one that will hurt their profits. 
  We must deal with this high yen problem in a calm manner. 
While the U.S. market's apprehension about inflation has caused 
the decline of the dollar, what has dominated the world economy 
since the end of the Cold War is disinflation as a result of 
low-wage nations' entry in the world market. Excesses in the 
market will correct themselves sooner or later. 
  In the government, top leaders met in a hurry to discuss 
measures to deal with the yen's appreciation, but this is 
something we have seen done time and again. What is important 
now is not responding to the yen's appreciation from the 
perspective of our own country but agreeing on policy 
coordination from a global perspective to stop the dollar's 
sharp fall. 
  Coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market has 
a 
temporary effect in taming turbulence in the market, but it has 
its limitations. 
  It is now time for the major countries to embark on policy 
cooperation that will go as far as reforming the structures of 
their economies. The July summit of the advanced nations (the 
Naples summit) will provide a good opportunity to do that. 
  The U.S. monetary authorities should flexibly manage their 
monetary policy to dispel apprehensions about inflation and do 
all they can to reduce the budget deficits. Germany should 
continue easing its monetary restrictions and revive its 
economy. Japan, for its part, should reduce is current-account 
surpluses by pushing to expand its domestic demand. 
  Japan should front-load the reduction of income taxes and 
keep the rise in the consumption tax only to the level of 
revenue neutrality. Deregulation should not be in name only, 
and it must be an effective one. Assuming a strong yen, it will 
also necessay to turn the country's export-dependent industrial 
structure into one led by domestic demand assuming. 
  The current-account surplus is expanding now; it is not 
clear 
if the economic recovery is on the right track yet. It will not 
serve the purpose of policy coordiantion if Japan is thinking 
about seeking deductible tax increases [sashihiki zozei] or 
taking the substance out of deregulation. We certainly hope the 
government will take actions and not fall into a situation of 
panicking once again as a result of failing to do anything this 
time.

  [Text] The major issues and points of argument to be 
included in the economic declaration of the summit of leaders of 
the advanced nations to be held for three days in Naples, Italy, 
starting on 8 July were decided on on 19 June. 
  While the world economy is recovering at a faster tempo than 
last year, maintaining economic growth and creating employment, 
that is, "growth and employment," are expected to be the central 
issues at the summit because of worsening unemployment. In 
particular, the United States and other nations are expected to 
strongly urge Japan to continue its tax cuts and to increase 
public investment substantially in order to expand domestic 
demand through fiscal measures. One of the focal points of the 
leaders' discussions will be whether to include 
country-by-country economic measures in the declaration. 
  With regard to aid to countries converting to a market 
economy, the leaders are expected to reach agreement on aid to 
Ukraine, which is in the midst of a serious economic depression. 
  A Japanese-U.S. summit is also expected to be held on 8 July 
immediately before the Naples summit. The two leaders are 
expected to confirm Japan's tax cuts beyond FY 1994, and recent 
points of agreement at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework 
talks to demonstrate the strong "cooperative relationship 
between Japan and the United States." 
  Unemployment has become the top priority political issue, 
especially for Europe. The total number of unemployed in the 
OECD nations has reached 35 million. While the United States 
strongly demands macropolicies to stimulate the economy, 
including tax cuts and other fiscal measures, and a loose 
monetary policy by lowering interest rates, to deal with 
unemployment, Europe and Japan favor a structural reform of the 
labor market by correcting the excessively high wage levels and 
unemployment benefits. 
  The main issue for Germany is a looser monetary policy; for 
other European countries, the structural reform of the labor 
market; for Japan, expanding domestic demand; and for the United 
States, reducing the fiscal deficits. 
  Following the agreement on aid to Russia at the Tokyo 
summit, 
the Naples summit will discuss plans to ask Ukraine, which is 
where the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located, to close the 
power plant completely in exchange for economic assistance. A 
survey team will be send to Ukraine, and aid measures will be 
discussed based on the findings of the team. 
  In addition, the leaders will confirm the conversion of GATT 
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) from January 1995, and 
they will discuss problems relating to the world trade system. 
They are also expected to include in the economic declaration 
stronger measures to prevent money laundering, which will also 
cover funds used for arms procurement, in order to deal with 
regional conflicts, as well as regulations on bribery by the 
advanced nations' companies in developing countries.

<F P=106> [By Kenichiro Hirano] </F>
  [Text] Manila, 19 Jun -- A plan for a "Southeast Asian 
Community" [SAC] consisting of 10 nations -- the six ASEAN 
member states plus Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma -- is 
beginning to take shape. According to a copy of the written 
agreement of these 10 Southeast Asian countries on an unofficial 
meeting (held in Manila in late May) obtained by NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN's Manila Bureau, this was the first time the promotion 
of regional integration similar to the European Union (EU) 
through the early membership of Vietnam and the three other 
countries in ASEAN, and political cooperation, has been written 
into a formal document. 
  While the meeting was an unofficial one, participants 
included senior government officials acting as personal 
representatives of each nation's leader, and academicians. The 
fact that a blueprint for the region's future has been clearly 
stated in an agreement is considered highly significant. 
  The preamble of this document entitled "A Vision for 
Southeast Asia After the Year 2000," which was signed by 
representatives of the 10 nations, points out that: "Southeast 
Asia is one single community. In the 21st Century, this 
community will play a major political, economic, cultural and 
moral role." It argues strongly for the need to strengthen 
regionalism in Southeast Asia, modelled after the EU. 
  The basic principles affirmed for the "Southeast Asian 
Community" concept are: 1) national and regional resilience; 2) 
harmony in diversity; 3) common national interests; and 4) open 
regionalism. At the same time, a multifaceted strategy is deemed 
necessary to realize the community. In the political and 
security aspect, the strengthening of bilateral relations 
between the 10 Southeast Asian countries, membership of the 
three Indochinese states and Burma in the Southeast Asian Treaty 
of Friendship and Cooperation (Bali Treaty, signed in 1976) and 
ASEAN, and their participation in the ASEAN regional forum are 
also sought. 
  In terms of economics and technology, the document seeks to 
advance the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), 
and the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) to the year 
2000, and proposes the promotion of various forms of social and 
cultural cooperation, such as encouraging personnel traffic, and 
launching an ASEAN satellite. 
  To materialize the "Southeast Asian Community" concept, the 
document suggests the following steps: early convening of a 
summit meeting of the 10 nations, taking the initiative to 
create a consensus among the 10 nations on lasting peace in 
Cambodia and the Nansha [Spratly] Islands issue, joint 
management of borders between the 10 nations, and assistance to 
the Mekong River Valley development project. 
  The 10 Southeast Asian nations plan to hold their second 
unofficial meeting in Bangkok before the end of 1994. While the 
materialization of the Southeast Asian community concept "will 
be a slow process taking 20 to 25 years," (according to 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos), a summit meeting may add 
momentum to the process.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroji Akita] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun -- Japan will export the latest 
communications system, the SDH [expansion unknown], to China. In 
the past, Japan's export of the SDH to China was banned by the 
export controls of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls (Cocom). Japan will export the SDH to China in 
response to Cocom's decision to lift export controls on the SDH. 
The NEC Corporation has won a contract from the Chinese Ministry 
of Railways to supply an SDH optical communications system to be 
installed for a 430-km stretch of railroad between Hengsui city, 
Hebei Province, and Shangqiu city, Henan Province, which is part 
of a 2,500-km railroad between Beijing and Kowloon (in Hong 
Kong), the construction of which is scheduled for completion in 
1997. NEC has contracted to supply the system by September 
1995. The Chinese Government, which places importance on 
upgrading its existing communications network, is eager to 
introduce the SDH. The NEC Corporation's export of the SDH to 
China will spur other Japanese communications companies to look 
for business opportunities in China. 
  The NEC Corporation is the first Japanese communications 
company to supply the communications system for a long-distance 
railroad in China. NEC anticipates that China's adoption of its 
communications system for the railroad will give it an upper 
hand in vying with other competitors in the future bidding to 
supply another communications system to be installed for the 
remaining 2,000 km of the railroad between Beijing and Kowloon. 
  The SDH is state-of-the-art technology. The SDH can more 
speedily handle information than can conventional communications 
systems, and it can store four times as much information as do 
conventional communications systems. In China, the volume of 
ground transportation has sharply increased as the economy has 
grown. In China, the supply of ground transportation has failed 
to catch up with the demand. The Ministry of Railways plans to 
use the SDH optical communications system to build a modern 
railroad control system in China. 
  With the end of the Cold War, Cocom was disbanded in March. 
It has been decided that a new international organization will 
be created instead with the mandate to curb international 
terrorist activities. Former members of Cocom are still obliged 
to continue to control their exports on their own until the new 
international organization is created. 
  The export of the SDH was banned under the export controls 
of 
Cocom. In April, AT&amp;T, a U.S. communications company, decided 
to supply an SDH optical communications system to China, and 
moves are afoot among industrialized nations to lift the ban on 
exports to it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota Motor Corp. </F>
chairman and new Japan Federation of Economic Organizations 
[Keidanren] chairman, by Masaaki Sato, member of NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN editorial board: "Shoichiro Toyoda Vows To Become a 
Powerful Prime Minister of the Japanese Business World;" place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Sato] When were you asked by the previous 
chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa to be his successor? And how did you 
feel when you were asked? 
  [Toyoda] He whispered in my ear during a party held on 13 
January to celebrate the accomplishment of the economic report 
by the Economic Reform Research Council [a private advisory 
panel to Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous Prime Minister]. I did 
not know what answer to give, because I was taken unawares by 
his proposal. Moreover, the next day, I had to leave for Britain 
on business. So, I replied: "Please let me have time to 
consider it. I will give you a definite answer after I return." 
  [Sato] But, I suppose you had a hunch that you would be 
picked as the new chairman, after Vice Chairman Akio Morita 
[chairman of Sony Corp.], who had widely been viewed as the most 
likely successor to Mr. Hiraiwa, suffered a sudden illness at 
the end of 1993. 
  [Toyoda] No, I never had such an idea. I read on the 
electronic newsboard that Mr. Morita was struck by a sudden 
illness while on board a Shinkansen bullet train. Moreover, the 
electronic newsboard further reported: "Opinions would be 
adjusted within Keidanren, with Toyoda as the top candidate for 
the next chairmanship." To speak the truth, I felt embarrassed 
when I saw it saying that I was regarded as likely to take such 
an important position of high responsibility. 
  However, I have been pondering over the matter since the 
beginning of January, when Mr. Hiraiwa, the previous chairman, 
spoke to me in private about the next chairmanship. After due 
consideration, I decided to take up the post and fulfill my 
duties by offering myself to the organization, since the post 
must be assumed by someone, and since it came to be my turn to 
take it. 
  When I explained my resolution to my company's honorary 
chairman (Eiji Toyoda, honorary Toyota Motor Corp. chairman and 
former Keidanren vice chairman), he got really angry with me. 
He said, "What are you talking about? Our company will be 
quite embarrassed if you undermine your health by assuming such 
a post." However, he never said: "All right, take up the post 
but just take it easy." (laughter) I think he wanted to say, 
"Do your best but take care of yourself." His words are now 
engraved in my mind. 
  [Sato] The business world is also being driven to reform 
following the collapse in the summer of 1993 of the so-called 
"1955 order" of one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. 
In terms of Japanese corporate management, the current 
recession has killed the business world's 1955 order premised on 
growth. The business world is now under pressure to restructure 
itself. 
  [Toyoda] Yes, I am fully aware of the situation. In a word, 
Keidanren's role under the 1955 order of the business world was 
to represent corporate interests. Keidanren was built based on 
the idea of the high-growth period; namely, the idea that 
corporate interests are directly connected with improvement of 
the nation's standard of living. Such an idea was warrantable 
under an economic system based on high economic growth and 
founded under the slogan "Let's catch up and pass the West." 
  However, whether we are willing or not, it is now 
indispensable to build a new economic structure that gives 
priority to consumers interests, given that the Japanese economy 
has not only caught up with the West but surpassed it. This 
inevitably brings on a change in Keidanren's role, and it is 
only right for us to change our way of thinking. 
<H5>  The Power of Execution Produces the Power of Execution </H5>
  [Sato) This is why Keidanren's raison d'etre is now called 
into question. Some people are of the opinion that since the 
economic structure under which corporate interests were 
equivalent to the people's welfare has disappeared, Keidanren's 
mission is over. They say that Keidanren should now transform 
itself into a think tank. 
  [Toyoda] It is true that, until now, Keidanren's activity 
has been based on the idea that corporate interests are 
equivalent to the people's welfare. However, it is not at all 
the case that this was the only justification for Keidanren's 
existence. Since its inauguration, Keidanren has made policy 
proposals to the government and the relevant agencies, after 
canvassing the opinions of major industries and companies. 
Keidanren's definite opinion was a reflection of the times. 
Keidanren once represented corporate interests, but from now 
on, it will attach greater importance to the protection of 
consumer interests. Making proposals does not represent the 
only justification of Keidanren's existence. Translating these 
proposals into action is also its raison d'etre. 
  For instance, until now, there have been many pertinent 
policy proposals, such as the so-called Maekawa Report 
[submitted in 1986, the Report called for changing Japan's 
export-oriented economy to one led by domestic demand] and the 
five-year economic plan for a better quality of life [submitted 
in 1992]. Unfortunately, these proposals were not realized. In 
the case of the Maekawa Report, right after it was submitted to 
the government, Japan's domestic consumption rose sharply due to 
the so-called bubble economy. This is why we got a false 
impression that the proposals made by the Maekawa Report were 
somehow put into effect. However, after the collapse of the 
bubble economy, we realized that nothing had been carried out. 
  [Toyoda continues] Many important issues of the day, 
including deregulation, are raised in the so-called Hiraiwa 
Report submitted by the Economic Reform Research Council. The 
proposed plan is realizable. Since it made the proposals, 
Keidanren has to execute them in a definite way. That is 
Keidanren's great mission. 
  [Sato] In September 1993, the previous chairman, Mr. 
Hiraiwa, decided to stop channeling billions of yen in political 
donations to political parties through the National Political 
Association on the behalf of major industries and companies. 
Many people now wonder what will be left to Keidanren, once it 
is deprived of its function of passing along political 
donations. The argument is that, because the organization's 
influence on politicians and bureaucrats will decrease if its 
function of passing along political donations ceases, Keidanren 
will lack the power of execution. 
  [Toyoda] I have to correct this misunderstanding. I would 
like to make it clear that Keidanren's influence has not been 
grounded only on passing along political donations. Its 
influence overlaps with its raison d'etre. As I just explained, 
Keidanren gathers different opinions from major industries and 
companies to make proposals. It also urges the Diet, the 
government, and the concerned agencies to take the necessary 
steps to implement these proposals. Meanwhile, member companies 
act together to put them into effect. Our words are backed up 
with deeds, and this is the source of our influence. 
  Keidanren played an important role in maintaining and 
developing a liberal economic system during the Cold War era. 
Channeling billions of yen in political donations to political 
parties was simply a means to attain this end. However, 
political donations are now perceived differently, given that 
political parties differ little from each other in policy 
following the 1955 order's collapse that triggered political 
realignment. With the growing public opinion that political 
parties should depend less on corporate donations and that 
political fund-raising should be made more transparent, 
Keidanren decided to abolish its political-donations role. 
Keidanren's position is that political parties should depend on 
government subsidies and private donations, while corporate 
donations should be reviewed, or even abolished, after a certain 
period of time. 
  With such a trend of the times, there is less and less 
significance in passing along political donations. From now on, 
Keidanren's influence should be based on its power to implement 
its proposals. Therefore, I will stick with Mr. Hiraiwa's 
decision to abolish Keidanren's political-donations role. 
Moreover, to study how business and politics should be, I am 
planning to set up a new committee within Keidanren. It will 
called the Committee on Business and Politics. 
<H5>  The Influence of Japan's Largest Manufacturer </H5>
  [Sato] Your remark that implementing its proposals is the 
source of Keidanren's influence has deep significance. 
  When we look at the history of Keidanren, we realize that 
each time Keidanren has exerted great influence, its 
chairmanship was always assumed by a business leader from a 
major company that had a great influence on the Japanese economy 
of the time. In other words, if the said company sets an 
example to others by promptly translating Keidanren's idea into 
action, Keidanren's other member companies are forced to follow 
suit. Therefore, it is certain that your background will help 
strengthen the power of execution not merely of Keidanren, but 
of the whole business world. You come from the automobile 
industry, one of the key Japanese industries of today. 
Moreover, you belong to Japan's largest manufacturing company. 
  [Toyoda] Japan is a nation without natural resources. 
Therefore, it imports materials, processes them, and exports the 
resulting products in order to earn dollars. With the money 
earned, Japan can buy food and oil from other countries. This 
is the foundation of Japan, at the center of which is the 
nation's manufacturing industry. 
  Personally, I do not feel that I am chairing Keidanren as a 
representative of the automobile industry. I simply think that 
the automobile industry's turn to take the chair has come 
because of the needs of the times. Seen from the viewpoint of 
industrial changes, Keidanren's top post should preferably be 
assumed by a business leader coming from an industry that stands 
half a step behind the leading edge, because unity and consensus 
is forged more easily within the organization under a leader 
coming from such an industry. It so happened that I have been 
working for an industry that is half a step behind the leading 
edge. 
  Of course, having a chairman from the automobile industry is 
a plus for the organization in some respects. The automobile 
industry has always walked in step with consumers. My 
experiences may be useful in developing the theme of living 
together in harmony with consumers, which will be the core of 
Keidanren's future policies. 
  Let me add a few more words as the leader of a company that 
bears the brunt of attack in the Japan-U.S. trade friction. Our 
company has been ahead of the government in trying to ease trade 
friction. When U.S. President George Bush came to Japan in 
January 1992, we committed ourselves to increasing our purchases 
of foreign auto parts and trying to sell more imported vehicles 
in Japan. We have fulfilled our pledges. If you ask me, 
automobiles have been raised as an issue in the Japan-U.S. 
Framework trade talks, but there have been no problems in talks 
between companies at the industry level. The problem is one of 
macroeconomics rather than microeconomics. 
  [Sato] Let me now ask you about specific policy proposals. 
What kind of new goals does the "Toyoda's Keidanren" have in 
mind? 
  [Toyoda] Our first goal is deregulation. Since March, 
Keidanren has announced a series of deregulation proposals for 
each area. We put all these proposals together and submitted a 
report to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 13 May. We will now 
strongly urge the concerned authorities, including the 
government's office for the promotion of administrative reform, 
to put them into practice. 
  In fact, deregulation is not likely to be implemented if we 
continue to leave it to government officials to examine 
deregulation plans and monitor their implementation at their own 
discretion. This is why a third-party monitoring body composed 
chiefly of individuals from the private sector is going to be 
set up in accordance with the law. We are tentatively calling 
it the "Administrative Reform Committee" and are planning to 
implement deregulation through it. I have already asked 
previous Chairman Hiraiwa to head the Committee. 
  Administrative reform, which is directly connected with 
deregulation, is also an important issue. When companies try to 
do something new, they generally meet strong administrative 
resistance. We cannot achieve our goal as long as 
interministerial barriers are not abolished. As an example, let 
me explain the case of the Export Inspection and Design Council, 
in which I am involved. This advisory body to the international 
trade and industry minister still has many posts that were 
created a long time ago when Japanese export products had to be 
examined carefully because of poor quality. I am really 
surprised that even a ministry like the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] still preserves such 
posts. However, if the ministry decides to abolish the 
regulation related to export inspection, it will have to 
relocate about 2,000 officials elsewhere. The fact is that it 
can hardly eliminate the regulation immediately. 
  Deregulation inevitably inflicts pain not merely on 
ministries and agencies but on the industry as well. Despite 
the pain, we should promote deregulation. Otherwise, Japan will 
fall into discredit with the world. 
  Once deregulation measures are implemented, the Japanese 
market will be opened, bringing about a decline in prices. In 
other words, we are convinced that deregulation will serve the 
best interests of the Japanese people. To make our conviction 
known to our overseas partners, we should make greater efforts 
to promote deregulation. 
  [Sato] The Japan-U.S. framework trade talks have made clear 
that Japan is not trusted by the world, right? 
  [Toyoda] I think that, when the bilateral framework talks 
collapsed in February, what collapsed in particular was the 
relationship of trust between Japan and the United States. 
Although the United States expected that Japan would implement 
income tax cuts for three consecutive years to stimulate 
domestic demand, the Japanese side came up with a plan to cut 
income taxes for just one year. Moreover, Japan was unable to 
give specific figures to explain the impact of the yearly income 
tax cut on the Japanese economy. Under such circumstances, a 
relationship of trust can hardly be established between the two 
countries. 
  [Sato] It is certain that the government's decision was 
influenced by the Finance Ministry's firm resolution to accept 
income tax cuts only in exchange for an increase in the 
consumption tax to cover the loss in revenue. The problem is 
that Japan passed up a precious opportunity to stimulate its 
sluggish economy because of the Finance Ministry, which strongly 
put forth such an argument from the very beginning. 
  [Toyoda] I once said to former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa: "If we compare the government to a company, the 
Finance Ministry is equivalent to the general accounting 
division. If there is no prospect of good business, the 
general accounting division would never say that the company can 
spend as much money as it wants. However, the decision does not 
lie with the general accounting division, but with the company 
president, which is you, Prime Minister Hosokawa." Then, I 
added: "Let's revive the national economy first by implementing 
income tax cuts. We can expect extra tax revenue once the 
economy picks up. The president should not leave the decision 
to the general accounting division. He must decide by himself." 
  Unfortunately, all my advice was in vain. If the prime 
minister had followed my advice, Japan would have not incurred 
the mistrust of the United States. I really regret this. 
  [Sato] You may say so, but the problem is that Japan's top 
leader changes too frequently. The general accounting division 
probably exercised precaution against a possible change in 
government (laughter). What do you think of the current 
political chaos? 
  [Toyoda] It is very difficult to foresee future political 
developments because Japanese politics is now in a transition 
period. Starting with the Diet deliberations for the fiscal 
1994 budget, the government must tackle a pile of pending 
domestic and international issues, such as tax reform and the 
G-7 summit meeting. Therefore, I want both the ruling coalition 
and the opposition to proceed with the Diet deliberations in all 
seriousness without producing a political vacuum, and to 
cooperate with each other in dealing with the pending domestic 
and international issues. Sorry for repeating myself, but I 
would like to remind the government that if Japan disappoints 
the United States again with its tax reform plan, it will 
completely lose the confidence of its partner. 
  With respect to political realignment, the industrial world 
is not in a position to say much, because this issue should 
reflect the will of the people. However, I think it would be 
desirable for Japan to have a political system of alternating 
governments. I have no idea about the ideal number of political 
parties. At least, however, I think that it is a problem to have 
so many small parties, as we do now. There is no basis to the 
argument that Japan must establish a two-party system like that 
of the United States. However, it is no good to have 10 or 12 
political parties. 
  [Sato] Concerning Japan-U.S. trade friction, what, 
specifically, are your thoughts on plans to cut Japan's trade 
surplus? 
  [Toyoda] Japan first has to achieve economic growth led by 
domestic demand in a domestic economic recovery, that is, 
through a revised and expanded public works program. We would 
then promote a structural reform of the Japanese economy through 
deregulation and market opening. There is no alternative to 
putting these two sound proposals into practice. 
  It is also necessary to correct the value of the yen against 
the dollar to an appropriate level that corresponds to the real 
state of the Japanese economy. In my opinion, the Japanese 
economy can tolerate appreciation of the yen to the 110-yen 
level against the dollar. The ideal level would be around 120 
yen to the dollar. Many companies, which recently announced 
their performance for the past year, have said that they have 
projected an exchange rate of 105 yen against the dollar for the 
next term. They are all dispirited because of the gloomy 
future. I think the 110-yen level is the maximum handicap that 
Japan can overcome somehow or other by making strenuous efforts. 
  [Sato] Regarding the bilateral framework talks, there was a 
long dispute over the question of whether or not to set 
numerical targets as a political pledge. Seen from a 
macroeconomics viewpoint, setting numerical targets is not 
considered necessarily a minus for Japan. 
  [Toyoda] Numerical targets, which are directly connected to 
managed trade, conflict with the spirit of GATT. Therefore, it 
is not possible to endorse such an idea. Meanwhile, it is 
certain that Japan will not be able to win the confidence of the 
United States, as long as it does not clearly indicate its 
policy to its partner. 
  Japan and the United States had previously agreed to apply 
objective criteria to measure progress in sectoral talks, which 
is part of the framework trade negotiations. Both sides had 
agreed to use objective criteria, and not numerical targets. 
However, the problem is that once the yardstick is fixed, 
concrete figures can easily be obtained anytime through 
measurement. I think Japan and the United States should bear 
this in mind when they try to restore a relationship of mutual 
trust. 
<H5>  No Change in Nation Based on Processing Trade </H5>
  [Sato] The upsurge of the yen against the dollar is fueling 
fears over a hollowing out of Japanese industry. What kind of 
measures are you considering to cope with this situation? 
  [Toyoda] A hollowing out of industry worries me the most. 
Japan is based on processing trade, and this will not change in 
the future. We must not forget that Japan is a country that 
works hard and exports the fruits of its efforts, namely 
high-value-added products. Therefore, if industry hollows out, 
Japan is finished. Having said that, what is to be done? 
  First, industrial restructuring should be done quickly to 
protect the international competitiveness of domestic 
industries. Second, new industries should be created. 
  Concerning the creation of new industries, I think that 
nothing is more pressing than improving the educational system. 
Japan has heard the cry a number of times that there was a 
crisis of hollowing out. Each time, Japan successfully created 
new industries. Education is the source of new industries. 
  However, of present concern is the recent lag in education, 
particularly in the teaching of science and technology. One of 
the causes is the poor condition of the facilities at university 
engineering departments. But I think that another problem is 
corporate attitude. The corporate attitude on hiring has 
perhaps been one of educating people once they enter the 
company. Individuals with a master's degree are welcomed, but 
those with doctorates are not needed. Therefore, companies 
usually try to recruit postgraduate students right after they 
have completed the master's course. This is not an environment 
for bringing up creative people. 
  I think Keidanren can lend a hand here to help improve the 
situation. 
  [Sato] Did your appointment to Keidanren's top post bring on 
a change in your company's behavior? Toyota Motor Corp. was 
once noted for what has been called the "Toyota Monroe 
doctrine." Toyota used to withdraw into its shell. 
  [Toyoda] When I became chairman of the company, I completely 
left the company's business in the charge of the new president 
[Toyoda's brother]. I did not give any specific instruction to 
my company after I was appointed Keidanren chairman. 
  As a matter of course, I want my company not to hesitate to 
feel the pain of deregulation, because in some way, Toyota is 
also living in peace within the framework of government 
regulations. Will deregulation mean a conflict of interests 
between Toyota and its partners? Or will Toyota try to change 
its corporate culture to seek common interests with its 
partners? That will be the problem. For the moment, I have 
already warned our dealers and our auto parts suppliers that 
Toyota will probably annoy them in the near future (laughter). 
  As for Toyota's behavior, I have been worried that my 
company 
might exercise severe restraint in its behavior because it 
produced a Keidanren chairman, and that it might consequently 
lose its vitality. On the other hand, I have also been worried 
that my company might take an attitude of arrogant superiority 
because it produced a Keidanren chairman, and that it might lose 
its philosophy of working hard to provide good products at lower 
prices. 
  Fortunately, I recently understood that there was no need 
for 
such apprehension, after observing the behavior of our 
employees. It may sound paradoxical, but the current recession 
is turning out to be advantageous to Toyota in this case. The 
Japanese economic situation is so serious that our employees 
cannot be in a festive mood just because their chairman was 
appointed to Keidanren's top post (laughter). 
  [Sato] We understand that you decided the lineup of vice 
chairmen in the new Keidanren after consulting with former 
Chairman Hiraiwa. Do you think you made the best choice? 
  [Toyoda] For now, this is the best lineup. If possible, I 
had wanted the four outgoing vice chairmen to remain. However, 
that is expecting too much, because I have to follow Keidanren's 
bylaws. I believe I made the best choice under the existing 
bylaws. 
  If we consider that Keidanren consists of major industries 
and companies, however, the securities and construction 
industries are also needed. Considering the structure of 
industry, I would like to request that those two industries join 
us at some point. 
  Many people seem to find it strange that the steel industry 
is missing from the new lineup. This is because I have asked 
recently departed Vice Chairman Hiroshi Saito (Nippon Steel 
Corp. chairman) to take up another important post, namely that 
of chairman of Keidanren's council. There is no vice chairman 
from the steel industry simply because my first consideration 
was keeping a balanced representation. 
<H5>  I Will Be a Chairman of the Toshio Doko Type </H5>
  [Sato] Do you have any specific Keidanren chairman in mind 
as your ideal? 
  [Toyoda] Personally, I am not very conscious of it, but 
since I am from a manufacturing company, I should bear some 
resemblance to the two former chairmen from Toshiba Corp.: 
Taizo Ishizaka [who served as Keidanren's second chairman, from 
1956 to 1968] and Toshio Doko [who served as the fourth 
chairman, from 1974 to 1980]. As I do not know Mr. Ishizaka 
very well, I feel closer to Mr. Doko. However, in terms of 
personality, the person I know the best is Mr. Hiraiwa. So I 
feel strongly inclined to follow Mr. Hiraiwa's pattern, because 
I have a long acquaintance with him and because I am very 
familiar with his ideas and remarks as Keidanren chairman. 
  As for Mr. Yoshiro Inayama of Nippon Steel Corp. [who served 
as the fifth chairman, from 1980 to 1986], he had a strong 
tendency to favor managed trade, such that he was even dubbed 
"Mr. Cartel." There was always a conflict of opinions between 
us. Each time I objected to him, he always said, "You may say 
so, but I and the Prime Minister are the only Japanese that 
really have the best interests of the nation at heart. You 
fellows, you do nothing but think of your own companies." I 
have now come to believe that there are many things to be 
learned from his arrogant remarks. 
  [Sato] You said at the beginning that you have been told by 
honorary Chairman Eiji Toyoda to take good care of yourself. 
Are you still playing golf to maintain your health? 
  [Toyoda] These days, my score is always 90 or more. I get 
into my stride on the front nine, but I go off my game on the 
back nine because my stamina gives out. 
  A few days ago, I shot a 42 on the front nine. Although I 
thought I would easily finish with a total of less than 90, I 
shot a 48 on the back nine. I usually explain to my golf 
partners that I am adjusting my score on the back nine to make 
my partners win the game because I am now a shrewd merchant 
(laughter). 
  [Sato] That's funny. This is why Mr. Eishiro Saito [who 
served as Keidanren's sixth chairman, from 1986 to 1990] 
jokingly said that you are like the chief of the secretarial 
section, who makes every effort not to win the game when he 
plays with important persons with whom his company has dealings. 
  [Toyoda] But now, even if I give my whole heart to the game, 
my score differs little from the one of the secretarial section 
chief (laughter).

"Strong Yen Muscles Firms Out of Japan"] 
  [Text] Since the yen soared to nearly Y100 to US$1 last 
August, the pace of Japanese relocation has gained momentum. In 
the past few months, Japanese companies have announced plans to 
move capacity out of their home base almost daily. China and 
Vietnam are among the most popular destinations, followed by 
Thailand and other ASEAN countries. 
  What's happening in corporate Japan? Is a restructuring of 
the world's second largest economy in the making? The strong 
yen coupled with rising costs at home have driven many 
once-formidable Japanese firms into the red. Moving 
increasingly-uncompetitive domestic manufacturing bases out to 
places where the comparative edges are clearly superior is what 
corporate Japan is doing relentlessly. 
  Wages, level of technological development in host countries, 
and the emergence of sub-regional economic groupings are key 
factors determining which Japanese industries go to which 
countries. As for the European markets, Japanese firms have set 
up factories in the European Union to ensure market access to 
all 12 countries. Non-EU countries will enjoy tariff privileges 
once their factories are in the community. Most of the 
relocations are in high-technology areas. 
  The ASEAN Free Trade Area [Afta] still has a long way to go 
due to the grouping's 15-year time span. Deputy premier 
Suphachai Phanitchapak has called for a shorter timeframe of 10 
years to avoid the grouping being left behind in the race of 
regionalism. 
  At the moment, Afta has not yet fully kicked into gear but 
the prospect of expanding membership will make the grouping more 
attractive especially as the emerging Indochinese economies like 
Vietnam become new members. 
  With the long time-span of complete implementation of Afta, 
Japanese firms have plenty of time and room to manouevre to 
fine-tune their position on the eventual outcome of this 
regional effort. In the case of European Union, Japan and other 
foreign investors do not have much time to spare so virtually 
everything had to be fixed quickly. 
  Japanese investment in Korea or Taiwan, regarded as the 
first 
newly-industrialized economies (Nies) after Japan, is also 
undergoing change. High-technology capacity is moving from Japan 
to this first tier of Nies. Wages are not the determining factor 
for projects in these countries. 
  Capacity down the technology ladder goes to countries like 
Thailand, Malaysia or Indonesia where wages are rising because 
of rapid economic prosperity over the past decades. Automobile 
and electronics industries are among the key sectors of 
relocation. 
  Industries which are very labour intensive then go to China 
and Vietnam where the level of technological development is low. 
This can be seen in the relocation of low-priced textile or 
footwear manufacturing in Thailand to China and Vietnam because 
of the wage factor. 
  With the wave of regionalism washing over the world, there 
are now enough different sub-regional groupings to create 
confusion among policy planners. Apec, Afta, Nafta, EAEC and 
Sea-10. Nies like Korea see Apec as the most promising of all. 
First, this grouping is the most comprehensive geographically, 
with members covering both sides of the Pacific. 
  Secondly, Apec has what appears to be the best mechanism to 
function -- senior official meeting, finance ministers meeting 
and plan for an environment minister meeting plus the summit of 
top national leaders hosted by U.S. president Bill Clinton last 
November. Its membership is also expanding, with Chile due to 
join Apec as the 18th member later this year. 
  The probability of Apec to work is high as evidenced by the 
last senior official meeting in Jakarta at which there was 
discussion on whether to turn Apec into an open free-trade 
group. Malaysia appears to be the only country that explicitly 
opposes this kind of trend.

  [Text] A stronger yen and a probable rise in US interest 
rates could solve some of Thailand's economic problems, says 
Bank of Thailand spokesman Phisit Li-atham. 
  The weakness of the U.S. dollar, stemming from a lack of 
coordinated efforts among central banks and heavy selling by 
foreign-exchange traders anticipating intervention, is creating 
pressure for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. 
  "The economy needs cooling," said Mr Phisit. 
  He said inflationary pressure in Thailand is manageable. The 
Bank of Thailand is expected to meet next month, however, to 
re-evaluate the situation based on higher crude oil prices and 
stronger than expected export performance. 
  Several Thai bankers estimate the Thai inflation rate to be 
close to 5 percent, a percentage point higher than the central 
bank's target of 4 percent. 
  Mr Phisit said a Bank of Thailand study found that interest 
costs amount to a small portion of Thai corporations' total 
business costs, and the effect of higher interest rates, 
approximately a quarter-points above the current rate, may not 
be severe. 
  A rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve would affect the 
Thai 
financial system and naturally push rates here higher, said Mr 
Phisit. "The increases are in the range expected by Thai 
businesses." 
  Higher inflation bought on by higher oil prices would be 
partially offset by higher foreign currency earnings, gained 
from exports that have outperformed the central bank's target, 
he said. 
  The baht has also strengthened against the dollar, standing 
yesterday at 25.05, the strongest in 18 months. Oil prices are 
quoted in dollars and Thailand tends to source lower-cost crude 
oil. Local refining capacity increases have also lessened the 
impact, said Mr Phisit. 
  On the trade picture, Mr Phisit said in the long run, a 
strong yen could force Thai importers to turn to other 
countries, while exports to Japan could benefit. Since Thailand 
is currently a net importer from Japan, however, increased 
import costs could add to the inflationary pressure in the 
medium term. 
  The net impact is the question, said Mr Phisit. 
  "Consumption of imports could decrease and locally 
manufactured products increase," he said. Thais' propensity to 
consume imported goods from Japan, has shown little sign of 
change in the past, however. 
  A recent Bangkok Bank economic forecasting model predicted 
that since the U.S. economy is primarily driving the world's 
economic growth, a U.S. slowdown could translate to a drop in 
Thailand's GNP growth, below the central bank's estimate of 
8-8.2 percent. 
  Japan's economy is showing signs of strength, however, and 
could supplement the U.S. as a market for Thai goods. Japan's 
economy, surprising most economist with a 3.9 percent annualized 
growth rate in the first quarter of 1994, saw its growth 
prospects increase even in a strong yen environment. 
  And with an economy that depends on exports to the U.S., the 
Japanese central bank had been supporting the dollar in an 
effort to reduce the pressure on Washington to increase interest 
rates. 
  Meanwhile, Thai Farmers Bank's executive vice-president 
Sombun Chinsawanon said the volatility in the international 
foreign-exchange market, where the yen is appreciating against 
the dollar and the Deutsche mark, is unlikely to make a strong 
impact on the Thai economy as a whole. 
  He said the sector that will be affected directly is 
external 
trade, particularly exports to the U.S. where exporters have to 
hedge themselves against foreign-exchange risks, making export 
prices higher. 
  But Thailand will benefit from exporting to Europe and Japan 
if they quote their prices in marks and yen respectively. 
Overall, the positive impact from exporting to Europe and Japan 
will outweigh the negative impact on exports to the US. 
  "Overall, Thailand will not be losing from the situation," 
he 
said. 
  The yen yesterday rose as high as 99 to the dollar. 
  During the past two weeks, the baht has appreciated 12 
satang 
against the dollar from 25.16 to 25.04. 
  Mr Sombun said the sudden weakening of the U.S. dollar 
stemmed from the recent series of rate increases by the Fed.

<F P=106> [By Phaisan Sicharatchanya and Saritdet Marukhathat: "More </F>
Than a Goodwill Visit"] 
  [Text] Bilateral Thai-Korean trade issues and regional 
security are expected to dominate official talks between Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai and South Korean leaders during the Thai 
premier's official visit to Seoul beginning today. 
  The agenda of the Thai side is clear: of the US$2.3 billion 
worth of two-way trade in 1993, Thailand suffered a US$1.2 
billion deficit and this deficit is expanding as a result of 
growing Thai imports of South Korean automobiles. So one of the 
key missions of the Thai delegation is to negotiate for larger 
South Korean imports of Thai products. 
  "For a country that now ranks as the eighth or ninth largest 
trading partner of Thailand, the level of knowledge and interest 
in South Korea from the Thai side has been minuscule," said a 
senior Thai diplomat based in Seoul. 
  Unlike the deep-rooted relations between Thailand and other 
major diplomatic and trading partners in Northeast Asia, such as 
Japan and China, there has been far fewer exchanges between 
businesses and educational institutes in Thailand and South 
Korea. As such, Thailand knows or understands little about South 
Korea. 
  The Thai side is not to be blamed entirely, however. It took 
four years for the South Korean side to hold what was supposed 
to be an annual, rotational meeting of the two countries' trade 
ministers. Following numerous delays, the meeting was finally 
held in Seoul last August and it is Thailand's turn to host the 
meeting this year. 
  All this could change for the better as a result of Mr. 
Chuan's visit. The prime minister brings with him about 10 
ministers responsible mainly for trade and investment plus a 
small delegation of Thai businessmen. 
  "The visit underscores Bangkok's recognition of South Korea 
as an important trading partner," said Surachai Sirikrai, 
director of Thammasat University's Institute of East Asian 
Studies. 
  "This should pave the way for more Korean investors to set 
up 
business here instead of in Indonesia, which is one way of 
easing the trade imbalance," he added. 
  In ASEAN, Indonesia has been preferred by South Korean 
investors partly because of its abundant natural resources and 
partly because they want to avoid stiff competition with 
Japanese businesses that are already well-established in 
Thailand. 
  Outside ASEAN, major South Korean corporations such as 
Hyundai, Daewoo and Ssang Yong are actively investing in 
Indochina, especially Vietnam, where they enjoy the same head 
start as other foreign investors and even a competitive edge 
over the Japanese. 
  The Thai emphasis on expanding economic ties will certainly 
appeal to South Korean leaders, who are not only intent on 
improving bilateral relations with Thailand but also on grander 
schemes. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam made clear in an 
interview with the Bangkok Post that he wanted Thailand to serve 
as a base for South Korean businesses venturing into Indochina 
and Burma. 
  He also held out hope for the dynamic economies of both 
countries to work jointly in leading economic growth in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  Judging from those statements, it is clear that Seoul is 
adopting a foreign-policy strategy similar to the Japanese as 
far as its relationship with Thailand is concerned. 
  Former Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, during his 
Bangkok visit in January 1993, also proposed a Japanese-Thai 
partnership to undertake the task of helping to rehabilitate the 
Indochinese economies. 
  In sum, Seoul is placing a greater emphasis on both economic 
and diplomatic relations with ASEAN. And just as South Korea 
sees itself as the centre of Northeast Asia, it also regards 
Thailand as its strategic partner in ASEAN. 
  Seoul also sees itself playing an important role within the 
broader framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) forum. South Korea is chairman of APEC's Trade and 
Investment Committee, which is one of the few institutionalised 
bodies in the regional grouping. 
  "As a dialogue partner of ASEAN on one side, and enjoying 
close economic linkages with North America on the other, we want 
to serve as the bridge between AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) and 
NAFTA (North American Free Trade Area)," said Assistant Minister 
for Foreign Affairs Choi Dong-chin. 
  The US is South Korea's biggest trading partner, taking 
one-third of its exports. Though ASEAN ranks fourth in terms of 
trade, it is South Korea's second-largest investment partner 
after the European Union. 
  Economic issues aside, the Thai and South Korean leaders 
will 
discuss measures to enhance cooperation on regional security. 
  In fact, security matters are topmost on the minds of the 
South Koreans. This is hardly surprising in light of the 
South's preoccupation with the North's suspected nuclear weapons 
development programme. 
  Asked what specific issues he would raise for discussion 
with 
Mr. Chuan, President Kim responded: "First of all, we will 
focus our attention on how our two countries should pull 
together to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which is 
threatening the security of not only this region but also of the 
entire world..." 
  As part of its diplomatic lobbying for international backing 
to force North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons programme, 
Seoul intends to solicit Thailand's support for sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
  Bangkok has all along maintained a low-key stance on the 
Korean nuclear conflict, apparently preferring to leave the 
issue to the major global powers to resolve. But the Thai 
Government is on record as saying that it would go along with 
any sanctions resolution adopted by the United Nations Security 
Council. 
  However, the prospect of imminent sanctions has now been 
momentarily blunted by North Korean leader Kim Il-song's pledge 
to freeze the North's nuclear programme plus his offer to hold 
the first-ever summit meeting with his southern counterpart. 
These messages were conveyed to former US president Jimmy Carter 
during his recent visit to Pyongyang. 
  Nonetheless, measures to resolve the nuclear dispute on the 
Korean peninsula will still feature highly in talks between the 
Seoul leaders and Mr. Chuan. 
  The South Koreans are attaching much importance to next 
month's meeting in Bangkok of the ASEAN Regional Forum. The 
last thing they want is to fight another Korean War with the 
North. Hence they are placing high hopes on the forum to evolve 
into a venue for addressing vital regional security matters such 
as arms control and preventive diplomacy. 
  "We'd like to actively participate in the Southeast Asian 
security forum," said Assistant Minister Choi. "We want to 
defuse potential conflict and promote confidence-building 
measures." 
  In the final analysis, Seoul wants to develop an economic 
and 
diplomatic partnership with Thailand so that both countries can 
help promote growth and security in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Given such high expectations, South Korean officials say Mr. 
Chuan's visit will be more than just a goodwill trip.

  [Text] As the chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee in 
1994, Thailand will organize a forum dealing with security in 
Asia, or the ASEAN Regional Forum -- ARF, on 25 July. Deputy 
Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan talked to a VOFA [Voice of Free 
Asia] correspondent about the ARF. 
  [Begin recording] [Surin] July the 25th will be a historic 
day for the region, or even the world. Eighteen foreign 
ministers or their representatives will participate in a forum 
on security, stability, and mutual confidence in Southeast Asia. 
The forum is called the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will stress 
security cooperation and confidence building in order to jointly 
develop the region into an area which is peaceful and permeated 
with an atmosphere conducive to cooperation. This will lead to 
economic prosperity. The theme is: whoever has an interest in 
this region is invited. Whatever issues regarding the concerns, 
anxiety, or lack of confidence that anyone has can be aired at 
the meeting in order to create a frankness in the process to 
transform the region into the most peaceful and stable zone. 
  The aforementioned is the philosophy set by the government 
from the beginning. It is the use of preventive diplomacy [two 
previous words rendered in English]. Regarding this philosophy, 
problems are prevented from worsening to disputes through 
dialogue and opportunities for dialogue available in the ASEAN 
arena in order to eliminate misunderstandings. 
  The 25th of July will be a historic day for the region and 
new-style diplomacy in Asia and the Pacific. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What will be the issues 
discussed in the upcoming ARF? 
  [Surin] The first currently hot issue is the situation in 
Northeast Asia -- the Korean Peninsula. The meeting will 
discuss how it can contribute to defusing the situation. Our 
belief is that a dispute anywhere in Asia and the Pacific will 
have repercussions upon the whole region. Therefore, we do not 
want to see an occurrence of disputes in Northeast Asia because 
it could create a lack of confidence and security in other 
regions, especially Southeast Asia. We want the ARF to be a 
forum for dialogue between countries, such as Korea, China, 
Japan, the United States, and Russia which may have a direct 
part in the stability and security in Northeast Asia. That is 
the first point. 
  The second point concerns the problems in Southeast Asia 
that 
worry countries outside the region. These problems include 
investment and stability in Indochina, problems in Burma, 
cooperation between ASEAN and countries outside in security, 
arms buildup, and making the region nuclear free and politically 
and militarily neutral. These issues will be discussed in the 
ARF. The smaller issues such as human rights, arms buildup, and 
territorial disputes will probably be brought up as well but 
they will not be points dominating the discussions. The meeting 
will likely talk about cooperation to prevent future disputes, 
or the use of preventive diplomacy, to gain prompt involvement 
of the United Nations or its organizations in solving the 
problems instead of solving them as were the case in Cambodia, 
Somalia, and Bosnia. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] According to a report from the Business Economic 
Department, the Commerce Ministry has received complaints from 
local manufacturers of dumping of hydrogen peroxide by India. 
After an investigation, it was found that the product was 
exported to Thailand at a price lower than the price charged 
consumers in India. In retaliation and in order to offset the 
impact, the Commerce Ministry has made hydrogen peroxide 
originating in India subject to a surcharge of 30 percent of FOB 
[freight on board]. The special surcharge has been in effect 
since 14 June. Importers of hydrogen peroxide are required to 
declare their surcharge payments using application forms which 
are available at the Foreign Trade Department. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Thai and Cambodian officials 
yesterday agreed to reopen the Poipet-Khlong Luk border 
checkpoint on July 1. 
  The closure of the border point on April 9 following 
fighting 
between Cambodian government forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
has hurt Thai traders and caused hardship to the Cambodians. 
Tourism has also slumped. 
  Earlier, the border was set to be reopened on June 1 but 
minor hitches delayed this by a month. 
  An agreement to reopen the border was signed yesterday after 
successful talks between the Cambodian delegation led by Banteay 
Meanchey Governor Gen Duong Khem and the 12th Army Division 
commander Gen Lai Vira and Thai representatives headed by Sa 
Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaiyasit and Burapha Task Force commander 
Maj-Gen Niphon Pharunnit. 
  Governor Kasem said although fighting had scaled down in 
Cambodia, stray shells still fell occasionally on the Thai side, 
causing damage to property and inflicting casualties. 
  Maj-Gen Niphon said he had proposed the setting up of a 
Thai- 
Cambodian coordinating office to deal with cross-border robbery 
and banditry by armed Cambodians. 
  Banteay Meanchey police chief Pol Maj [Police Major] Mar 
Putthou said Highway 5 from Poipet to Sisophon was under 
military protection and safe for travel. 
  At the crossing yesterday about 5,000 traders and villagers 
from both sides gathered at the border checkpoint, hoping to 
cross the border to resume their trade. But their hopes faded 
as officials barred them from crossing.

  [Text] Thailand's first HIV/AIDS vaccine tests are expected 
to be discontinued after it has been found they violate the 
HIV/AIDS National Vaccine Development Plan. 
  The Thai Red Cross Society's AIDS programme director, 
Praphan 
Phanuphak, earlier this month injected 30 volunteers with an 
initial dose of the candidate vaccine, GP 120, to test its 
safety. 
  A senior official with the National AIDS Prevention and 
Control Committee said yesterday the AIDS programme had not 
followed the National Vaccine Development Plan's guidelines 
which state that any institution testing vaccines should be 
equipped with laboratories. 
  The results of the candidate vaccine on the volunteers are 
not tested by Dr Praphan. They are sent to the vaccine 
producer, United Biomedical Incorporation of the United States, 
for testing. 
  A member of the World Health Organisation (WHO) steering 
committee on AIDS vaccine development, Nat Phamonprawat, said 
Thai researchers should carry out any vaccine tests even if the 
vaccine is obtained from abroad. 
  He said Thai researchers should head the tests and any 
foreign researchers should only act as advisers. 
  Dr Nat said Thailand should set up laboratories to test 
vaccines so it can obtain maximum information about the results. 
  The Public Health Ministry's AIDS Division director, Wiphut 
Phuncharoen said it was unacceptable for the blood of volunteers 
to be sent to the United States for testing. 
  "How can we be sure the manufacturing firm is not biased 
towards its own product?" he asked. 
  Mr Wiphut said it was the responsibility of the National 
AIDS 
Prevention and Control Committee's Data Safety Monitoring Board 
to look into locally conducted HIV/AIDS vaccine tests. 
  The committee chaired by Dr Prasoet Thongcharoen of Mahidon 
University now cannot function officially because Public Health 
Minister Athit Urairat has not approved the committee's 
appointment. 
  Dr Athit, the chairman of the Sub-Committee on National AIDS 
Prevention and Control, cannot sign the appointment because he 
is in hospital. 
  The deputy chairman of the House Committee on Public Health, 
Wichai Chaichitwanitchakun of the New Aspiration Party, warned 
Dr Praphan to stop the tests of the HIV/AIDS vaccine following 
reports from the US that six of 300 volunteers being tested 
there have become infected with the deadly disease. 
  But Dr Wiphut of the AIDS Division said the consent forms 
signed by volunteers injected with the vaccine in the US clearly 
states the volunteers were not infected with the virus due to 
the vaccine. 
  Dr Wichai said the Red Cross Society should be responsible 
for the volunteers' health for three to five years after the 
tests, not simply for the nine months while the tests are being 
conducted, as side effects may develop later. 
  He said he would also propose to Parliament that it issue a 
law providing up to two million baht in social security benefits 
for medical staff working with AIDS patients. 
  The Red Cross's Dr Praphan was unavailable for comment 
yesterday.

  [Text] Support from all resources in the country including 
public cooperation is required to cope with possible acts of 
international terrorism, National Security Council [NSC] chief 
Charan Kunlawanit said yesterday. 
  The NSC chief made the statement at a seminar on "Policy and 
Guidelines on International Terrorism" which was jointly 
organised by the NSC and the Interior Ministry. 
  The seminar at Government House was attended by about 450 
senior government offices, provincial governors and high-level 
authorities concerned with international terrorism. 
  Gen Charan said that since 1972 there have been eight 
incidents regarded as acts of international terrorism, the last 
being the huge water-tank bomb containing C-4 plastic explosives 
found in a truck in front of Lumphini police station in March 
this year. 
  Most of the events involved the hijacking of aircraft. In 
these events, Thailand had never been a party in the conflict, 
he said. 
  For example, the water-tank bomb was aimed at an embassy by 
terrorists from another country who chose to use Thailand as the 
venue for their activities, he added. 
  Gen Charan said that Thailand, as a member of the 
International Terrorism Suppression Organisation, has exchanged 
information and intelligence on activities and identities of 
blacklisted international terrorists. 
  The NSC itself has coordinated with the National 
Intelligence 
Agency and Police Department on this matter but people in 
general are usually unaware of such activities, he said. 
  Gen Charan said Thailand has a policy of not wanting to see 
any terrorist activities in the country. If an event of this 
nature takes place, Thailand would solve the problem in a way it 
can to maintain the country's interests.

  [Text] This morning, two terrorists belonging to the BRN 
[Barisan Revolution Nasional] Group -- Mr. Takariya Bunae, 30, 
and Mr. Doloying Totanyong -- both natives of Pattani Province, 
surrendered to Mr. Banyat Chanthasena, provincial governor of 
Yala, so as to participate in the national development program. 
  On this occasion, the governor of Yala congratulated the two 
persons for having admitted their faults and for deciding to 
become good citizens so that they can live with their families 
and earn an honest living. He also said that the government 
authorities are willing to give fair treatment to those who 
surrender and will try to find ways to enable them to lead 
peaceful lives in society. 
  The two who surrendered had lived in the jungle for two 
years 
and all the time had had to escape government officials. Due to 
heavy suppression by government authorities in every locality, 
they therefore contacted officials concerned for their 
submission. 
  Moreover, the two men disclosed that at present terrorists 
are scattered in different places after fleeing attacks by 
government officials. 
  The Yala provincial governor gave some money to the two 
national developers as a morale-boosting gesture.

<F P=106> [Report on 30 May interview with Deputy Prime Minister Tran </F>
Duc Luong by QUAN DOI NHAN DAN correspondents Thuy Chi and Hong 
Ky in Hanoi] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong met with 
newsmen on 30 May in Hanoi after his 10-day visit to the United 
States from 18 to 28 May. He answered many questions from our 
correspondents: 
  [Correspondent] Dear Deputy Prime Minister, how do U.S. 
businessmen view the opportunities for doing business and 
investing in Vietnam? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] The U.S. business circle has admitted that 
Vietnam, with a population of more than 72 million, is a large 
market. The country also has a favorable position as a country 
in a fast developing economic region. During previous years, 
the U.S. business community took the lead in demanding that the 
U.S. Government normalize relations with Vietnam. At present, 
U.S. companies are continuing to request the government to 
normalize relations with Vietnam as soon as possible and to 
grant it the most favored nation status so that they can have 
favorable conditions for doing business in Vietnam. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, could you 
elaborate on the areas of great potential in cooperation between 
the U.S. and Vietnam? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] The U.S. companies are paying keen interest 
in all projects to which Vietnam wants to attract foreign 
investment, especially projects related to oil and gas, 
telecommunications, and electronic and computer items. While 
U.S. industrial companies are paying keen interest in the 
Vietnamese market, various prestigious financial and banking 
agencies in the U.S. say they will send representatives to 
Vietnam soon. 
  The eight Vietnamese businessmen who accompanied me had 
separate meetings with their U.S. counterparts and have reached 
initial agreement on some areas, including plans to export a 
large amount of rice to the U.S., the exploitation of oil and 
gas in Vietnam, and the opening of direct flights between the 
two countries. 
  [Correspondent] Is the U.S. business sector raising any 
obstacles at all regarding doing business and investing in 
Vietnam? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] In our meeting with U.S. businessmen, we 
presented both sides of our situation. We not only told them 
about the potential and prospects in the Vietnamese markets, but 
also frankly briefed them on the difficulties and restrictions 
in doing business in our country. For example, our 
infrastructure is poor, our legal system is not yet perfect, and 
our economic cadres and state management mechanism are not 
effective because we have not yet firmly grasped the functions 
and activities of the market economy. U.S. businessmen who have 
visited Vietnam understand the difficulties currently faced by 
our country. They said that these are immediate difficulties 
that Vietnam can overcome and then step by step improve and 
perfect the business and investment situation in the country. 
  [Correspondent] What is your appraisal of the potential of 
Vietnam-U.S. relations? 
  [Tran Duc Luong] In the past, the U.S. Government drew a 
road 
map for the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations and the U.S. 
Government has affirmed that it will continue with this road 
map. During our meetings with authorized U.S. officials, we 
asked whether the U.S. has a new road map or timetable for the 
normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations, to which they answered 
that the two countries are advancing on the road to normal 
relations and toward the direction of building a good 
relationship and mutual understanding. I think that, 
strategically, both countries have realized that it is essential 
to establish normal relations so as to advance toward building a 
sincere friendship and cooperation in a constructive spirit. 
This is the unswerving and principled stand of both sides. In 
addition, both sides will hold more meetings in the near future 
to resolve various outstanding problems. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister.

<F P=106> [From the "Topical Talk" by Editor Vu Dinh Vinh] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted on the growing trend toward 
peace and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region] The situation 
in the Eastern Sea also directed regional and international 
public attention to us as various incidents have occurred right 
on the continental shelf of Vietnam and its exclusive economic 
zone. The above situation requires that all countries, be they 
big or small, resolve their differences and disputes. This 
includes their current territorial disputes, which must be 
resolved through peaceful negotiations on the basis of respect 
for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial 
integrity and respect for international law in line with the 
common trend toward refraining from the use of force or the 
threat of force and the creation of pressure in international 
relations. 
  Vietnam has been and will be working according to the motto 
cited in ASEAN's Manila Declaration of July 1992 and in the 
statement of the 10th Nonaligned Conference in Jakarta in 
September 1992. Vietnam also hopes that all the parties 
concerned will also follow these principles. 
  Regarding the Eastern Sea situation, we categorically assert 
the sovereignty of Vietnam as a coastal country and the 
Vietnamese people's determination to protect their sovereignty 
over their continental shelf and their exclusive economic zone 
in accordance with international law, especially with the United 
Nations' 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. We also affirm 
Vietnam's stance of good will, that is its desire to resolve all 
differences in accordance with the above principles and to call 
on those parties concerned to avoid further complicating the 
situation. 
  Everyone knows that security and stability in the Eastern 
Sea 
is a decisive factor for the collective security and stability 
of the entire Asia-Pacific region, for the safety of sea routes, 
and for trade development in one of the world's bustling 
regions. The Eastern Sea has great significance for the 
interests of many countries and it is hoped that this will 
inspire those parties concerned to resolve and deal with their 
differences in a scrupulous fashion. For our part, Vietnam 
pledges to do the same. 
  We will be providing a brief review of the situation in the 
region to show the course of diplomatic activities of our 
country during the first six months of 1994: 
  -- The scope of the already close relationship between 
Vietnam and Laos has been broadened, thus improving the 
effectiveness of the all-around cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  -- The visit of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to Cambodia in 
early April this year brought Vietnamese-Cambodian relations 
into the orbit of substantive cooperation with the signing of a 
series of agreements on trade, economic, cultural, scientific, 
educational, training, and transit cooperation, and on the 
establishment of a joint commission. As for the two pending 
issues, namely the border issue and the issue of foreign 
nationals, Vietnam and Cambodia have agreed to set up a 
subcommittee to resolve these issues through negotiations. 
  -- With ASEAN countries, recent inexorable exchanges of 
visits between high-ranking Vietnamese leaders and the leaders 
of ASEAN countries testified to the vigorous growing trend of 
cooperative relations between Vietnam and the ASEAN countries. 
Apart from those agreements on cooperation in various domains, 
especially in economic, trade, cultural, scientific, and 
technological fields, on a bilateral basis, a new trait of the 
situation is that the multilateral relations between Vietnam and 
ASEAN have been raised to a new level. 
  All the ASEAN countries have supported the idea of promptly 
granting ASEAN membership to Vietnam. As an immediate step, 
they have allowed Vietnam to participate in five committees and 
six cooperation programs and in the regional forum to be held in 
Bangkok in July to exchange views on measures to be taken to 
guarantee regional security. 
  -- Worthy of note is that following President Ho Chi Minh's 
first visit to Myanmar [Burma] in February 1958, our prime 
minister also paid an official visit to Myanmar -- a Southeast 
Asian country which has great sentiments for us and has long 
provided assistance to our people's struggle -- in May 1994. 
  -- The Vietnamese-Chinese relations have been marked with 
the 
extensive exchanges of various delegations from all sectors and 
echelons, including a Vietnamese National Assembly delegation 
led by the National Assembly chairman. The two sides have 
signed various agreements on transit shipping and have opened 
various border gates such as the Mon Cai and Dong Hung border 
gates. These measures are aimed at putting their business and 
exchange activities on the right track. Various talks at the 
expert level on overland boundaries and on the delineation of 
the Bac Bo Gulf in accordance with the agreement on basic 
principles for resolving border and territorial issues on land 
and at sea were signed between the two countries in October last 
year. The territorial border issue is, of course, not simple 
and has, at times, been very complicated. We need patience and 
good will and we must refrain from doing anything that may 
further complicate the situation. [passage omitted reviewing 
various trips and state of relations with countries] 
  Proceeding from the desire to see a peaceful and stable 
Korean Peninsula and with its consistent support for the cause 
of peaceful unification of Korea, Vietnam has always striven to 
consolidate its friendly relations with the DPRK and broaden its 
mutually beneficial relations of cooperation with South Korea. 
In this direction, our party and the Korean Workers' Party have 
exchanged visits at the party central committee secretarial 
level. The South Korean foreign minister officially visited 
Vietnam in mid- May 1994 while a high-level Vietnamese military 
delegation led by Senior General Doan Khue, minister of national 
defense, has been on an official friendly visit the DPRK since 
mid-June. [passage omitted] 
  Dear comrades and friends, it can be said that the first 
half 
of 1994 saw inexorable diplomatic activities by Vietnam. Not 
only did these activities contribute greatly to the cause of 
peace, stability, cooperation, and cooperation with countries in 
the region and the world but they also demonstrated the positive 
character of Vietnam's efforts to stabilize and develop its 
socioeconomic, security, and national defense activities. These 
new traits have been all the more a source of encouragement for 
our Army and people to remain firm in the cause of building and 
defending their socialist fatherland.

  [Text] The National Assembly Office issued Communique No. 
21 as follows: 
  Today the National Assembly held a plenary session in the 
conference hall under the direction, in the morning, of National 
Assembly Vice Chairman Vu Ha Phan. The deputies discussed and 
passed the Domestic Investment Encouragement Law, the amended 
Company Law, and the amended Private Business Establishment Law. 
The deputies heard a report from Finance Minister Ho Te on 
behalf of the Compilation, Inspection, and Secretariat 
Committees. In the report he summarized the opinions and 
suggestions of deputies on the Law of Domestic Investment 
Encouragement. 
  Later the deputies heard Secretariat Member Ly Tai Luan read 
the draft law chapter by chapter and the assembly voted on its 
approval. There were 22 deputies who voiced their opinions about 
the draft law. They are: Mai Thuc Lan and Nguyen Don from Quang 
Nam-Danang; Pham Phu and Le Khac Binh from Ho Chi Minh City; 
Nguyen Ngoc Tran from An Giang; Le Xuan Tung from Hanoi; Truong 
Thi Khue from Quang Tri; Huu Tho from Vinh Phu; Nguyen Viet Dung 
from Ha Bac; Dang Khoi from Nam Ha; Do Van An from Son La; Le 
Viet Duoc from Thanh Hoa; Nguyen Quoc Thuoc from Nghe An; Nguyen 
Khuong from Binh Thuan; Cu Hoa Van from Lao Cai; Dam Van Nguy 
from Cao Bang; Nguyen Khac Tao from Ha Tinh; Nguyen Thi Hong 
Minh from Minh Hai; Nguyen Duc Thang from Kien Giang; Tran Anh 
Kiet from Quang Ngai; Nguyen Van Yeu from Hai Hung; and Nguyen 
Dinh Loc from Yen Bai. 
  During the discussion, Finance Minister Ho Te explained the 
issues that deputies had further raised about the draft law. 
The assembly voted chapter by chapter and passed the whole 
draft law on domestic investment encouragement. This is an 
important law which will contribute to the motivation of all 
capital sources such as natural resources, manpower, and other 
potentials of our country. 
  The assembly also heard Finance Minister Ho Te to report on 
behalf of the Compilation, Inspection, and Secretariat 
Committees, which summarized the opinions of deputies on the two 
drafts of the amended laws on companies and on private business 
establishments. Secretariat Member Ly Tai Luan read the full 
texts of the two draft amended laws. The assembly unanimously 
passed the two draft amended laws. The promulgation of the 
amended laws on companies and on private business establishments 
is the answer to a number of newly arisen problems and will 
ensure consistency in current legal stipulations. 
  In the afternoon, the assembly worked under the direction of 
National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy to pass the draft 
law to amend a number of provisions of the Military Obligation 
Law. The assembly heard National Defense Deputy Minister Dao 
Dinh Luyen give a report on behalf of the Compilation, 
Inspection, and Secretariat Committees summarizing the opinions 
of deputies on the draft law. Secretariat Member Nguyen Thi Ngoc 
Phuong read the text of the draft law. Fifteen deputies spoke 
on the draft law. They were: Tran Van Cua from Minh Hai; Tran 
Van Nien from Kien Giang; Do Quoc Thang and Cu Hoa Van from Lao 
Cai; Duong Tan De from Vinh Long; Dinh Van The and Nguyen Xuan 
Thuyet from Vinh Phu; Vu Dinh Cu from Hanoi; Truong Thi Khue 
from Quang Tri; Dang Cong Thach from Long An; Tran Thi Mien from 
Hai Hung; Nguyen Khac Tao from Ha Tinh; Dam Van Nguy from Cao 
Bang; Nguyen van Rang from Ho Chi Minh City; and Nguyen Quoc 
Thuoc from Nghe An. 
  After the deputies had spoken, National Defense Deputy 
Minister Dao Dinh Luyen further explained the issues raised by 
the deputies. The assembly passed, chapter by chapter, the whole 
draft amended law on military obligation. This is an important 
law which responds to the need to heighten the quality of our 
army in order to strengthen our national defense in the new 
situation. 
  Also in the afternoon session under the direction of 
National 
Assembly Vice Chairman, the deputies heard Vu Mao, member of the 
National Assembly Standing Committee and head of the 
Secretariat, read the report of the National Assembly Standing 
Committee on the law making plan of the National Assembly in the 
last six months of the year, a report on the opinions of 
deputies to amend the National Assembly Resolution, and the 
draft of the National Assembly Resolution on the law making plan. 
  More deputies gave their opinions: Nguyen Dinh Loc from Yen 
Bai; Dang Khoi from Nam Ha; Ho Te from Haiphong; Nguyen Viet 
Dung from Ha Bac; and Hoang Minh Thang from Quang Nam-Danang. 
The assembly then unanimously passed the resolution on the law 
making plan for the next six months. 
  Tomorrow, 23 June, the National Assembly will hold a plenary 
session in the conference hall.

  [Text] Recently, the Dong Nai Province Agricultural 
Materials Corporation imported 40 tonnes of poor quality DK888 
corn strains from Thailand for sale to peasants in Xuan Loc 
District, Dong Nai Province, causing heavy losses to production. 
  After reviewing a report by the Government Office and the 
action taken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry 
and the Dong Nai Province people's committee, the prime minister 
of the Government instructed the people's committee to prepare a 
detailed report on the case to determine the responsibility of 
the Agricultural Materials Corporation [AMC] for the imports and 
sale of poor quality corn strains to peasants, take appropriate 
disciplinary action against those individuals involved, and 
adopt urgent practical measures to ensure the interests of the 
peasants. 
  The prime minister also instructed the people's commitee to 
direct the Agricultural Materials Corporation in contacting the 
Thai exporter to resolve this problem. 
  Following this incident, the prime minister instructed state 
management agencies and organs and units in charge of supplying 
agricultural materials countrywide to uphold a sense of 
responsibility in preventing a recurrence of such an incident.

  [Text] The prime minister, Paul Keating, has again said 
the government sees no need for an increase in official interest 
rate arguing that such a rise would only generate new wage 
claims. But as speculation continues over a possible rise 
Federal Opposition Leader Alexander Downer has attacked the 
prime minister's record on financial management. 
  [Begin Downer recording] I would make the point that it was 
Mr. Keating as the treasurer who deregulated financial markets 
and wanted Australia to operate in this deregulated environment 
and there's no point in him turning around, now having 
deregulated financial markets and attacking those financial 
markets for not agreeing with him. [End recording]

  [Text] A meeting of Bougainville representatives on both 
sides of the secessionist uprising has called on the Papua New 
Guinea [PNG] Government to agree to a resumption of talks as 
early as next week. The call on talks for preparations for a 
peace conference comes after a meeting of Bougainvillians in 
Solomon Islands capital, Honiara, on Tuesday. 
  The Bougainvillians issued a joint statement asking the PNG 
Government to urgently consider calling a cease-fire so that 
senior leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] 
could attend the meeting. The statement said the terms of the 
cease-fire could be negotiated. The statement said a lasting 
peace and amicable solution to the Bougainville conflict could 
only be solved by the people of the island themselves working 
together with all sides involved. 
  A scheduled meeting earlier this week to discuss a peace 
conference fell through because senior BRA leaders said that 
they could not attend.

  [Text] Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Paias Wingti has 
revealed that talks between government officials, Bougainville 
leaders, and rebels had been canceled earlier this week because 
the leaders of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army could not 
attend. The Port Moresby based newspaper, THE NATIONAL, says Mr. 
Wingti told us that the Honiara meeting did not go ahead as 
planned because the government decided that Francis Ona and Sam 
Kouna had to be involved. He said the government did not want 
to waste its time by talking to a variety of people and then not 
getting any results. Mr. Wingti reportedly also said that the 
government would not make any announcements until talks between 
the leaders on both sides were over.

  [Text] Wellington, June 21 (AFP) -- Foreign investors are 
continuing to buy into New Zealand faster than locals are buying 
assets overseas, government statistics showed Tuesday as the 
country's net international investment position deteriorated for 
the fifth year. 
  The statistics show that at the end of March 1993, the net 
position was 54.3 billion New Zealand dollars (32.08 billion US 
dollars) in deficit, 8.1 billion dollars worse than the previous 
March and the fifth year of decline. 
  This flowed from a decrease of 1.4 billion dollars to 31.7 
billion dollars in overseas assets held by New Zealand investors 
and an increase of 6.7 billion dollars to 86 billion dollars in 
foreign-held assets in New Zealand. 
  The 6.7 billion dollars increase in New Zealand's total 
international liabilities stemmed from rises in both foreign 
equity holdings in New Zealand companies and in borrowings 
overseas. 
  Equity rose to 23.2 billion dollars at the end of March 1993 
from 18.5 billion dollars a year earlier, mainly due to a 4.6 
billion dollar increase in foreign direct investment involving 
25 percent or more of the voting shares of a company. 
  New Zealand investment abroad amounted to 21.7 billion 
dollars at March 31, 1993, compared with 24.8 billion dollars a 
year earlier. 
  In contrast, foreign investment in New Zealand increased to 
76 billion dollars from 71 billion dollars.

  [Text] Wellington, June 21 (AFP) -- New Zealand will find 
it difficult to monitor what happens to people who speak to a 
group of its MPs when they visit the disputed Indonesian 
province of East Timor, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said Tuesday. 
  Bolger's answer in parliament came in response to a question 
on the upcoming visit by MP Phil Goff. 
  "Will it be a condition of that visit that the delegation be 
free to speak with whomever they wish, and given Amnesty 
International's warnings on past experience about victimisation 
of those who speak to such delegations, will it be a condition 
that those spoken to will not be subject to subsequent forms of 
reprisal?" Goff said. 
  Bolger, who visited Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta 
earlier this year after a majority of New Zealand MPs signed a 
petition protesting alleged human rights abuses by Indonesia in 
the former Portuguese colony, said he believed Suharto would 
welcome the visit by four or five MPs. 
  But, he added, "Its going to be very difficult for us to in 
anyway to control or monitor that." 
  Bolger said he had suggested the MPs also visit other 
Indonesian provinces during their August 18-September 13 trip, 
including West Timor, for comparison purposes. 
  During Bolger's visit to Jakarta, Indonesian Foreign 
Minister 
Ali Alatas claimed New Zealand parliamentarians had only a 
shallow understanding of the situation in East Timor, annexed by 
Indonesia in 1975 in a move still not recognised by the United 
Nations.

  [Text] Apia, June 20 (AFP) -- Western Samoa's ailing 
national carrier Polynesian Airlines (PAL) will receive another 
financial boost if government funds become available, Prime 
Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana has promised. 
  He told parliament on Monday the government had no intention 
of folding PAL and, pending approval of the government budget, 
it will receive 1.5 million tala (520,000 US dollars). 
  This would be the government's first direct cash injection 
for the airline that so far has been funded by 
government-guaranteed international loans. 
  In April Treasury Department financial secretary Sala Epa 
Tuioti said PAL had a debt equivalent to about 26 percent of the 
government's income, posing a threat to the state. 
  He estimated PAL's total debt to be 45.2 million tala. The 
size of the debt made it "highly unlikely that any commercial 
lender would offer to make PAL a loan" even with a government 
guarantee, he said. 
  PAL deputy general manager Muliagatele Gina Moore said 
Monday 
the April Treasury report had been a distortion. 
  "Unfortunately this leak has caused substantial damage to 
Polynesian's reputation at a time when substantial benefits to 
the economy from tourism and air cargo are just beginning to be 
felt," she said. 
  She said passenger levels from North American and Australia 
were at all time highs and its assets were substantial.

  [Text] APIA, June 20 (AFP) -- Western Samoa's dignity had 
been damaged in 1980 by apologizing to Nauru, Prime Minister 
Tofilau Eti Alesana told parliament here Monday. 
  Lashing out at Nauru, he compared its size to that of a 
glass 
of water and said it was a Pacific nation with no honorific 
greetings or genealogy. 
  His assault on phosphate rich Nauru came just two weeks 
after 
Nauru President Bernard Dowiyogo was here for independence 
anniversary celebrations. 
  Tofilau was referring to an incident in 1980 when, under a 
previous government, claims were made that Nauru had funded 
opposition political groups. As a result of the claims, Nauru 
promptly withdrew its investments in Samoa, resulting in an 
apology from the then government of Prime Minister Tupuola Efi, 
who is now Opposition Leader and is known as Tupua Tamasese Efi. 
  The most senior member of the opposition Samoa National 
Development Party present in the house, Ulualofaiga Talamaivao 
Niko, said Monday's remarks by Tofilau were "childish and 
stupid" and would have a damaging impact on relations with "our 
brothers in the Pacific." 
  "If we look down on Nauru because of the size of Nauru, how 
would we feel if countries bigger than Western Samoa did the 
same? ...I'm very ashamed.

<F P=106> [By Ko Tae-song] </F>
  [Text] The ROK Government took the initiative to propose a 
preliminary contact for the early realization of the North-South 
summit talks. Diplomatic measures supporting the government's 
initiative in North Korean affairs are becoming concrete. As 
soon as the telephone message proposing the preliminary contact 
was sent to North Korea on 20 June, the Foreign Ministry 
immediately gave formal notice of the fact to its allies, 
including the United States and Japan, permanent members of the 
UN Security Council, including China and Russia, and 
international organizations including the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. The government made it clear to the 
international community that it is moving toward dialogue while 
keeping the stick of sanctions in hand. 
  The government is pursuing the North-South summit talks 
while 
rechecking the alliance between the ROK and the United States 
under the assessment that the dialogue phase might be the last 
chance to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
This reflects the government's position that the United States 
and the international community's demands, including special 
inspections, are necessary elements for achieving the 
fundamental goal of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  The government is reportedly evaluating the variables of the 
situation presented by the North-South summit talks and the 
third round of North Korea-U.S. talks while straightening up the 
confusion related to Former U.S. President Carter's visit to the 
North and rechecking the alliance to cope with the new 
situation. Based on various scenarios, the two governments are 
reportedly adjusting their positions regarding the verification 
of agenda in case the North-South summit talks are realized, the 
plan for achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, 
and the principles of the North Korea-U.S. talks. 
  The government also welcomed Japan's reaffirmation of the 
three-party alliance between the ROK, the United States, and 
Japan at a time when the North-South summit talks are being 
pursued, and reportedly asked for Japan's diplomatic support to 
realize the summit talks. The government is checking Japan's 
intention through diplomatic channels regarding Japanese Foreign 
Minister Kakizawa Koji's remarks at the House of Councillors' 
Foreign Affairs Committee on 20 June that the elimination of 
nuclear suspicions will not be a precondition to the resumption 
of negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations with North 
Korea. As negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations 
between North Korea and Japan could actually be resumed around 
the time of the North-South summit talks, the government is also 
finalizing its position regarding this possibility. 
  As the general situation is inclined toward the possibile 
resumption of dialogue with North Korea, the Foreign Ministry 
has readjusted the principle of three-channel dialogue -- 
dialogue between the North and the South, North Korea and the 
United States, and North Korea and the IAEA -- and established a 
policy to utilize the three channels to complement each other. 
The government's position in the case of dialogue between North 
Korea and the IAEA, is that, with North Korea's withdrawal from 
the IAEA, it is better to induce practical dialogue rather than 
to agitate North Korea by demanding its return to the IAEA. 
According to a relevant government official's explanation, the 
government's readjustment of the basic frame of channels of 
communication is designed to efficiently respond to Russia's 
intention to exercise influence on the North Korean nuclear 
issue with its proposal of an eight-party conference, while 
taking advantage of the development in the North-South summit 
talks. 
  With the resumption of the North Korea-U.S. talks, the 
government decided not to oppose the third round of high-level 
North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea's sincerity is verified 
and to keep watching the result of working-level contacts 
between North Korea and the United States in New York. The 
government is positively appraising the remarks by U.S. 
President Clinton on 21 June that North Korea's proposal made 
through Former President Carter is a hopeful sign and that 
verifications will be made through contacts between North Korea 
and the United States. The government expects that the ROK and 
the United States may disagree on assuring the transparency of 
not only the present and future but also past nuclear activities 
of North Korea. The government reportedly conveyed a strong 
message regarding its position to the United States.

<F P=106> [By Kim Pong-son] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 23 June, the government will hold 
an emergency meeting of the Unification-National Security Policy 
Coordination Council headed by Chairman Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime 
minister and minister of the National Unification Board, to 
fine- tune its final position before it takes future 
countermeasures in the wake of North Korea's acceptance of our 
proposal for a preliminary contact for the summit talks. 
  In particular, the government will decide on which three 
delegates will represent our side at the preliminary contact and 
notify the North Korean side of the list. 
  The government has temporarily designated Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi as the head delegate. It has been learned that the 
government will select two vice ministerial-level officials as 
other delegates. 
  It has also been learned: President Kim Yong-sam gave 
directives that the government see to it that the summit meeting 
is realized as soon as possible, regardless of time or place. 
In this connection, the government will work towards finalizing 
its policy to realize summit talks in July.

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
studying the possibility of making inter-Korean summits a 
regular dialogue channel once the proposed inter-Korean summit 
is realized in July, informed official sources said Thursday. 
  The government is also considering opening a hot line 
between 
Seoul and Pyongyang so that President Kim Yong-sam and his North 
Korean counterpart Kim Il-song can discuss key issues over the 
phone at any time. He noted the hot line is necessary for 
discussion of important issues to ensure the common prosperity 
of all Koreans as well as peace and stability on the peninsula. 
  The official said the summit should not be a one-off event. 
"It is desirable to regularize the summits in such a manner as 
to hold a second meeting in Pyongyang if the first meeting is 
held in Seoul," he said. 
  Some Koreans favor a third site other than Seoul or 
Pyongyang, citing as a precedent the first summit between West 
and East Germany. The official, however, emphasized that it 
must be held in either Seoul or Pyongyang from a symbolic 
standpoint. 
  "The earlier the meeting is held, the better it will be," he 
said, voicing hope that it would come in early July. 
  Meanwhile, the government will soon discuss matters related 
to the summit based on the principle of denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula agreed between Seoul and Pyongyang, and the 
agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, exchanges and 
cooperation which was signed at a prime ministers meeting in 
1991.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time and Venue for the South-North Summit </F>
Talks"] 
  [Text] Presently, there are many speculative and 
prospective remarks concerning the South-North summit talks. 
The important thing is for the summit meeting to be successful. 
Everything is important regarding the question of the 
reconciliation between the South and North and of national 
unification, including the North's nuclear issue. The issue of 
averting a war at this very moment is also very urgent. 
  For the realization and success of the summit talks--on 
which 
the future fate of our nation depends--both the South and North 
should approach this issue in a sincere and prudent manner. 
This is because we should solve the question of our nation's 
survival, not the issue of systems or regimes. In this regard, 
we think it fortunate that the North side has agreed to our 
side's proposal for a working-level contact at Panmunjom on 28 
June. 
  This notwithstanding, the North side is still continuing 
vilifying broadcasts toward the South and has spread word that 
President Kim Il-song told a Japanese woman that he hopes the 
summit will take place in Pyongyang on 15 August. If this 
report is true, we have to take issue with his real intention 
regarding his preference for 15 August. The day of national 
liberation is really a good date, however, the problem is that 
the North will be holding a political event, the so-called "15 
August pannational rally," on that day. 
  Needless to say, the "15 August pannational rally" is part 
of 
the North's idea for the convocation of "the political 
consultative conference"--whose realization the North has 
pertinaciously advocated--in connection with its strategy for 
the reunification front against the South. If they propose 
holding the summit talks in tandem with such a pannational 
rally, we cannot but suspect their ulterior motive on two 
points. First, we suspect that they might weaken the 
significance of the summit talks if it is part of the 
pannational rally. Second, we suspect that under the pretext of 
opposition from the South, they might attempt to bring the 
summit meeting itself to naught and, at the same time, to avert 
sanctions related to their nuclear development. Under whatever 
circumstances, if the summit meeting is suspected to be 
connected with such an ulterior motive, it will be meaningless, 
therefore, we find this very unacceptable. 
  As proposed to us through former U.S. President Carter, the 
North has to prove its sincerity and seriousness to the 
unconditional South-North summit talks. To this end, it should 
change its irritating or antagonistic attitude toward the South. 
It ought to call off vilifying and seditious broadcasts against 
the South that spoil the atmosphere for the summit talks and to 
give up the idea of launching a big offensive of political 
propaganda by convening the pannational rally with the 
participation of a South Korean Federation of General Student 
Councils [Hanchongnyon] representative. 
  Of course, it is not so easy to remove the antagonistic 
sentiments--which have been pent up over the past half a century 
of national division--and to achieve the long-cherished national 
desire for unification. It is, therefore, all the more 
necessary for the South and North to show a sincere and serious 
attitude to the reconciliation and dialogue between the South 
and North. National unification will be more remote if the 
North, as well as the South, should try to make use of the 
summit talks to maintain their respective political power; and 
in the North's case, from the viewpoint of its strategy toward 
the South. We should also make a prudent approach to the time 
and venue of the summit talks. North Korea, too, should 
corroborate its sincerity for the realization of the summit 
talks at the preliminary contacts.

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has confirmed 
that it will accept international inspections of sites that 
could reveal its past nuclear activities, South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday. 
  Pyongyang, in a letter to Washington, said it would "comply 
in full" with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards agreement, 
Han said at a press conference. 
  "You can take this to mean that this includes North Korea's 
compliance in explaining its past nuclear activities," said Han. 
  Han's remarks suggest that North Korea has agreed to the 
"special inspections" demanded by the IAEA, the UN nuclear 
watchdog agency, of two sites believed to store nuclear waste 
materials after the North's secretive reprocessing activities in 
the past. 
  Han denied widespread press reports that Washington was 
ready 
to overlook whatever North Korea may have done during its past 
nuclear development. 
  "That's just not true," said Han. "The past has been the 
problem from the beginning, and that is why the matter was 
referred to the UN Security Council. We cannot close our eyes 
to that." 
  On the proposed inter-Korean summit, the foreign minister 
said Seoul will not try to set the agenda beforehand though the 
two sides are expected to discuss implementation of the 
agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  A "miraculous" breakthrough in the nuclear impasse was 
achieved after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met directly 
with North Korean leader Kim Il-song. 
  Kim relayed through Carter that North Korea would comply 
fully with the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime and 
with the IAEA safeguards accord, allow IAEA inspectors to remain 
in North Korea, keep IAEA monitoring equipment in operation and 
freeze its nuclear activities. 
  Pyongyang confirmed these intentions directly to Washington 
Thursday, and U.S. President Bill Clinton personally declared 
that efforts for UN sanctions against North Korea will be 
suspended and the next round of U.S.-North Korea high-level 
talks will open in Geneva early next month. 
  What North Korea said about complying fully with the NPT and 
the safeguards accord "carries in it various meanings," Han told 
reporters, especially regarding its intentions to show what it 
has done in the past with spent fuel. 
  "At least the possibility of recounting the past through 
access to the two undeclared sites remains alive," he said. 
  "It is unclear as to whether it is still possible for the 
IAEA to recount what North Korea did with its spent nuclear fuel 
rods in a way it wants and needs. But an explanation of the 
past would be possible when this complemented access to the two 
sites," said Han. 
  As to what constituted satisfactory inspection of past 
activities, the foreign minister said it would have to be a 
method guaranteeing 100-percent transparency deemed satisfactory 
to the IAEA. 
  He denied reports that the Clinton administration was ready 
to overlook what North Korea may already have done. 
  "It was a choice of whether the issue of the past should be 
settled before or during the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
high- level talks. It was not a choice of whether to address or 
ignore it," said Han. 
  While stressing the importance of both tracing the past and 
staving off nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Han said the 
time factor places more emphasis on freezing the North's nuclear 
program. 
  He described a "new basis" to continue diplomatic efforts on 
the nuclear problem created by Pyongyang's latest gesture. 
  "It's true that the basis for dialogue was broken when North 
Korea unloaded fuel rods from its nuclear reactor," he said. 
  "But a new basis was laid with new conditions such as North 
Korea's promise not to reload and reprocess."

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has invited 
South Korean sports officials to a meeting this weekend to 
discuss the second East Asia games slated for Sept. 20 next year 
in Pyongyang. 
  An official at the Korean Amateur Sports Association (KASA) 
said on Thursday that the Pyongyang East Asia Games Organizing 
Committee extended the invitation to KASA, informing that the 
Pyongyang games' eighth consultative meeting would be held in 
Taipei on June 26-28. 
  The message dated May 25 was delivered through the Taiwan 
Olympic Committee. A copy of the message was later sent to the 
Korean Olympic Committee [KOC] via the Chinese Olympic 
Committee, the official said. 
  Originally North Korea planned to hold the eighth meeting in 
Japan during the Hiroshima Asian games period. But, at the 
suggestion by games member countries that it would be too late, 
North Korea advanced the time of the meeting to this weekend, a 
sports source said. 
  In response to the invitation, KASA would send three 
delegates including Pak Sang-ha, KOC International Committee 
chairman, to the Taipei meeting, the official added.

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and 
Energy Minister Kim Chol-su said Thursday he feels a strong 
sense of responsibility to run for the post of secretary-general 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
  "It's a great honor that the Korean Government has 
recommended me as a candidate for the position, but at the same 
time I feel a heavy responsibility to compete for the post at 
the world organization which is called the United Nations of the 
economy," Kim said in an interview. 
  He explained that the new WTO secretary-general is entitled 
to officially launch the trade body next Jan. 1 or at the 
earliest possible date thereafter. 
  The new secretary-general, he continued, should also push 
for 
negotiations on the service sector that are still pending after 
the Uruguay Round. 
  In addition, the group's chief must exercise leadership in 
solving the myriad world trade problems linked to the 
environment, economic policies, labor standards and technology 
policies, he noted.

  [Text] Kwangju, June 22 (YONHAP) -- About 1,000 students of 
the Namchongnyon organization violently demonstrated Wednesday 
afternoon here in Kwangju demanding the stoppage of what they 
called "Namchongnyon suppression" and the release of arrested 
students. 
  The demonstration lasted about one and half an hours 
beginning around 5 P.M. along a street near the east ward office 
near Sosok-dong. 
  When riot police fired tear gas canisters, the students 
mostly of Chonnam and Chosun Universities countered it with rock 
hurling, paralyzing traffics. 
  At an earlier rally held at the Chosun University campus, 
the 
students also demanded the safe return home of those Kwangju 
students stranded in Seoul and asked for the disclosure of the 
truth of the June 18 violent clash at Hong-ik University in 
Seoul. 
  Meanwhile, at the reports of the renewed issuance of search 
and seizure warrants against the two Kwangju campuses, students 
erected barricades at their school gates to keep police from 
entering. 
  So far 110 Namchongnyon students were arrested for their 
part 
in unlawfully stopping a passenger train and in the violent 
clash of June 18 in which more than one hundred policemen and 
students were injured. 
  Student arrests are likely to swell as the police, 
determined 
to ferret out all those who actively took part in the violence, 
have launched an extensive manhunt. 
  Students claim that both the train stoppage and Hong-ik 
University clash were the results of "traps" laid by the police.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chon Yong-taek, full-time member of the </F>
National Security Council and chairman of the Emergency Planning 
Committee, by Kim Tang; place and date not given -- first 
paragraph is SISA JOURNAL's introduction] 
  [Text] The National Security Council, the Emergency 
Planning Committee, and the Chungmu Program are all unfamiliar 
organizations and terminologies. Chairman Chon Yong-taek (57) 
is a minister-level high-ranking figure serving as a full-time 
member of the National Security Council, which is a 
constitutional institution advising the president, and as 
chairman of the Emergency Planning Committee assisting the prime 
minister. Regardless of his position, he is an unfamiliar 
figure to the people. Nevertheless, since the North Korean 
nuclear crisis has been thrown into taking sanctions against the 
North by the ROK, the United States, and Japan, thus heightening 
a tense situation on the Korean peninsula, the people are under 
a situation in which they must familiarize themselves with the 
Chungmu Program of which Chairman Chon is in charge. At the 
crossroads of peacetime and wartime, the following is an 
interview with Chairman Chon on diagnosing the current situation 
and taking a posture of preparedness. 
  [Kim Tang] The holding of the National Security Council 
meeting, the first one since the new government set sail, 
attracted an extraordinarily amount of attention. Is the current 
situation such as to convene a national security meeting? 
  [Chon Yong-taek] The government had held security related 
ministerial meetings, high-ranking strategic meetings, and 
reunification and security policy coordination meetings in the 
past to take measures regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. 
However, since the National Security Council meeting--a 
constitutional institution--was held officially for the first 
time, people are apt to feel that there is a serious critical 
situation. Before the Fifth Republic set sail, the National 
Security Council meeting was held regularly every quarter. 
However, it was held once or twice annually after the Sixth 
Republic was launched. This must have given a sense of tension 
to the people. The meeting was not convened because there was a 
critical emergency situation. 
  [Kim] In the operational regulations of the National 
Security 
Council it is stipulated that except for an "emergency matter," 
the agenda to be discussed must be presented seven days in 
advance and distributed five days before. If it is not an 
emergency matter, why was this normal operational regulation 
avoided? 
  [Chon] The president decided to hold such a meeting when he 
was in Uzbekistan. An atmosphere was created to fully discuss 
the issue of taking sanctions against the North by the United 
Nations when the president was on a visit to Russia. Also, the 
National Security Council meeting convened because the president 
judged, after holding a telephone conversation with President 
Clinton, that it was necessary to give North Korea a firm 
message. Formally it was regarded as an emergency matter 
because of the pressing time, but it was not carried out 
urgently because the content of an emergency agenda had to be 
discussed. It only seemed an emergency matter because of the 
limitations in time and venue. 
  [Kim] How was the atmosphere of the meeting? 
  [Chon] On the one hand, participants of the meeting were 
disappointed because the North Korean nuclear issue has led to 
taking sanctions against the North, and on the other hand, it 
was an atmosphere of communion of minds in that the government 
must deal with this matter resolutely and with confidence. The 
president revealed that he will convey his firm will and message 
to the people and the North Korean regime. It was an opportunity 
for the officials who attended the meeting, who are to draft and 
execute the state's policy, to examine that they will deal with 
the situation, even it turns to the worst, with resolute 
confidence. 
  [Kim] Were there any matters for resolution? 
  [Chon] It is not a time to make it public at this time and 
also it is not a matter to make it public. 
  [Kim] My question is not what matters were resolved but 
whether matters were discussed. 
  [Chon] That is also a secret. There are two functions in 
the National Security Council meeting. The first function is a 
resolution function, to establish a policy guideline through 
discussions by the members to establish foreign, military, and 
domestic policies related to securing national security. The 
second function is a reporting function, to analyze and assess a 
situation. The recently held meeting had a stronger reporting 
function. 
  [Kim] What was the content of your report? 
  [Chon] I cannot give you any details. I just gave a report 
on "the state's mobilization preparedness if UN sanctions are 
taken against the North," which the Emergency Planning Committee 
is in charge of. What I would like to emphasize is that going 
into a phase of sanctions does not mean that we are going to 
have a war. What I mean is that we must persuade the North 
Korean authorities even through forcible means. I made a report 
on the government's posture for preparedness if we go into an 
emergency situation and on taking measures for a possible 
provocation from North Korea which may be expected during the 
period of sanctions, if things do not go well. 
  [Kim] You are the chairman of the government's Emergency 
Planning Committee and a full-member of the National Security 
Council. What is the function of the Emergency Planning 
Committee? 
  [Chon] The three main roles of the Emergency Planning 
Committee are maintaining the government's function; assisting 
military operations; and stability of the people's livelihood. 
In other words, first the government organization must be 
changed into a war structure so that the government's functions 
can be carried out as in normal time; second, the government 
must mobilize all the resources for carrying out war to assist 
the military; and third is stabilization of the people's 
livelihood. This is to assist and manage work so that the 
people can maintain a stable life even during war. For example, 
it will supply necessities of life and when there are acts of 
buying up and hoarding goods, it will control circulation and 
price as the time demands. Also, it may carry out ration 
systems to stabilize the people's livelihood. These functions 
will be carried out through the Chungmu Program, the state's 
emergency plan in case of wartime, which the Emergency Planning 
Committee is in charge of. 
  [Kim] This state structure, which carries out an important 
role, is not stipulated in the National Government Organization 
Act. 
  [Chon] The basis for establishing the Emergency Planning 
Committee is clearly stated in the law on managing resources for 
emergency set up in 1984. 
  [Kim] It seems that most of the people do not know the 
content of that law or that there is even that kind of law. For 
example, most of the adults are targets of the law on managing 
resources (human resources), and is the press not also a target 
to be managed? 
  [Chon] Yes. Since South-North confrontation was a 
confrontation of ideology and system, cooperation from the press 
is absolute in all-out national efforts. Therefore, we have 
sent an emergency plan to press the organs and designated the 
organs to be mobilized during peacetime in preparation for an 
emergency. 
  [Kim] Under the law of managing resources, what was 
presented in detail as an emergency situation? 
  [Chon] It differs according to the signs or magnitude of a 
war or a crisis that can threaten the nation's security. 
  [Kim] Does it mean that it is carried out step by step just 
like the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command's operational plan, 
the OPLAN 5027? 
  [Chon] Yes. Regarding an emergency situation, the 
government judges that it is inevitable to have a close 
connection with the military's preparedness. If the military 
enhances the posture of preparedness, the Chungmu Program will 
be geared gradually. However, when the final proclamation on 
order of mobilization in wartime is made or when an emergency 
situation occurs, the military will explain the situation, but 
the government will make decisions through a cabinet meeting on 
a step-by-step basis. 
  [Kim] If the Chungmu program had been a preparation for 
North Korea's southward invasion in the past, should the current 
program have not included measures for a sudden collapse in 
North Korea, for instance, a refugee plan? 
  [Chon] A war always comes with refugees. Plans for 
sheltering and relieving refugees are one of the functions of 
stabilizing the people's livelihood. The Chungmu program is a 
wartime plan and does not include plans for such a sudden and 
special situation. 
  [Kim] Then, do you mean that the Chungmu program is only 
related with the OPLAN? 
  [Chon] They are certainly related. One of the three major 
functions of the Emergency Planning Committee is to support 
military operations. However, the core of the Chungmu program 
is to maintain government functions. If the government stops 
functioning, there will be no military operations or 
stabilization of the people's livelihood. Therefore, the 
Chungmu program is not for military operations alone. 
  [Kim] The Emergency Planning Committee would need actual or 
map exercises. What kinds of exercises are conducted by the 
Emergency Planning Committee? 
  [Chon] The Ulchi exercise is the typical one. It is 
basically a map exercise of the three major functions that I 
just have mentioned in a simulated war situation. Sometimes, 
actual exercises are conducted for those fields that require 
special evaluation and checking of the plan's actual efficiency. 
  [Kim] Ulchi and Focus Lens exercises will be combined 
beginning this August. 
  [Chon] Yes. However, it is a methodological decision aimed 
at maximizing the effect of the exercise. It has no other 
objectives or messages. The Focus Lens is purely a military 
exercise. Because the military exercise cannot be separated 
from the Chungmu program, only the inter-government training 
part of the Ulchi-Focus Lens exercise is controlled by the 
Emergency Planning Committee and the military part of the 
exercise is controlled by the commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined 
Forces Command. In principle, the prime minister takes overall 
responsibility but the military exercise is commissioned to the 
commander of the Combined Forces Command and the 
inter-government training is controlled by the prime minister 
through me, the umpire. The prime minister is the general 
supervisor [chonggam] and I am the chief of the central control 
group [chungang tongje tanjang]. 
  [Kim] At the National Assembly Defense Committee on 9 June, 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae expressed his confidence in the 
preparedness for an all-out war. Do you think it is possible 
that North Korea would start a war? 
  [Chon] I believe there is little possibility that North 
Korea 
would start a war judging from the objective conditions after 
the collapse of the Cold War system. However, as everyone 
knows, North Korea adopted four major military lines from 1964 
and has invested 20 to 24 percent of the gross national product 
in defense to prepare for a war. In addition, North Korea has 
repeated irrational acts, including the Panmunjom ax incident, 
terror at Aung San Memorial Hall in Burma, and the bombing of a 
Korean Air plane. Thus, we cannot say that there is no 
possibility that North Korea would start a war by objective 
conditions or classical strategic theories. I would like to 
emphasize that it is not important whether or not a war would 
breaks out, what is important is that we are fully prepared so 
that the enemy cannot attack us. 
  [Kim] If UN sanctions are implemented and are to reap 
fruits to some extent, we have no choice but to employ 
semi-military means, such as a naval blockade. But by driving 
North Korea to a dead end in such a way, does it not give North 
Korea a justification to evoke a provocation, such as violating 
the Armistice Agreement? Would this not happen if North Korea is 
pushed to a dead end? 
  [Chon] The media have been reporting on various scenarios, 
however, they are only scenarios and have no credibility at all. 
The present stage is a stage of mapping out international 
sanctions and I do not even know in what form and order 
sanctions would be taken. No decisive methods and procedures 
have been chosen. And even if the situation enters a phase of 
sanctions, the government cannot spell out the worst-case 
scenario beforehand and disclose to the media its measures 
against such a scenario. This is because the government would 
impose sanctions with an upbeat view that North Korea would 
change its stance during the period in which sanctions are 
imposed against it. Of course, the government is fully prepared 
with various measures since North Korea is expected to resist in 
any way in case sanctions are invoked. This is also an 
assumption. 
  [Kim] The media recently quoted the TIME's report on 
pessimistic and optimistic views over the result of a war game. 
Do such scenarios have credibility? 
  [Chon] A game is only a game. I do not know whether the war 
game coincides with reality or not, however, there can be some 
assumptions in this. The first assumption is that North Korea 
would succeed in a surprise attack. There is no strong man who 
can counter a surprise attack. No matter how formidable the 
Army may be, it can fall victim of a surprise attack. With such 
an assumption, defense difficulties follow in the war game. 
Such being the case, it is very important to know whether such 
an assumption is rational. Another tragic scenario is that the 
North Korean Army's vehicles, cannons, and tanks invade the ROK 
through underground tunnels. No one can absolutely deny such a 
possibility. It is even more impracticable to assert the real 
possibility of an underground invasion like that. In fact, 
underground tunnels are very fragile. When an exit is uncovered, 
everyone inside the tunnel is doomed to die. This kind of an 
imprudent war cannot be unleashed. Accordingly, it is important 
to know whether the assumption is rational and realistic. Defeat 
in a war game takes place because a computer was set up to be 
defeated. For example, the enemy's large-scale mechanized unit 
is inputted into a computer on the assumption that the enemy 
makes a surprise attack into Munsan and Chorwon as an axis. 
  [Kim] However, a vague psychological fear prevails in our 
society. 
  [Chon] Our basic strategy is the ROK-U.S. joint deterrence 
strategy. In other words, it is a strategy aimed at deterring a 
war on the Korean peninsula. We are heightening military 
preparedness not for victory but for the deterrence of a war. 
The strategic concept of the ROK Force is "the metropolitan 
area equals the ROK." Fifty percent of our country's national 
assets and 45 percent of the population are concentrated on the 
metropolitan area. Our strategy on defending the metropolitan 
area is firm and the Chungmu program has also been supplemented 
and developed over a long time. Moreover, the defense capability 
of ROK-U.S. Joint Forces is formidable. Even if the enemy 
evokes a provocation, there is no need to worry about the combat 
capability in the front line. When the rear is well prepared 
against the intrusion of the enemy's special unit, a worrisome 
situation will never arise. 
  [Kim] What kind of determination or preparedness should our 
people have at the present stage? 
  [Chon] As you are well aware of, a country such as 
Switzerland is perfectly prepared against contingencies even 
though it has no threat from outside. In Switzerland, every 
work place is equipped with a protection facility and every 
household has an underground protection facility prepared 
against chemical, biological, and radiological warfare and is 
also equipped with enough emergency food and medicines to last 
for over six months. Its reserve forces, whose houses are armed 
with individual firearms, have preparedness in which they can be 
mobilized within 48 hours in more than 48 divisions. Maybe that 
might be the reason Switzerland is enjoying the best quality of 
life in the world. What is important for us is not whether a 
war arises or not but having a determination and preparedness in 
times of peace.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO - Japan on Thursday [23 June] 
welcomed an agreement between the United States and North Korea 
to hold high-level talks in Geneva early next month to defuse 
the standoff over North Korea's alleged push for nuclear weapons. 
  ``We welcome the move toward U.S.-North Korea talks,'' Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said at a regular news 
conference. 
  The top government spokesman also urged Pyongyang to allay 
international concerns over its nuclear program through action 
and pledged that japan will continue efforts to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue in close concert with the U.S. and 
South Korea. 
  Specifically, Kumagai said North Korea should formally 
return 
to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), comply with 
international nuclear safeguards requirements, and implement a 
joint declaration with South Korea for a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula. 
  ``It is important to persuade North Korea in various ways,'' 
Kumagai said. 
  In March last year, North Korea said it was pulling out of 
the NPT but suspended the decision later. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton announced wednesday that the 
U.S. 
and North Korea will hold high-level talks in Geneva early next 
month following Pyongyang's assurances that it will freeze its 
nuclear program while the talks are in progress. 
  Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said japan cautiously 
welcomed the U.S. Government's confirmation of North Korea 
pledge to freeze its nuclear program, as well as Washington's 
intention to resume diplomatic talks with Pyongyang. 
  The sources said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
conveyed Washington's decision to hold a third round of 
high-level talks with Pyongyang in a telephone call earlier in 
the day to Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. 
  They said the U.S. Took note of Japan's desire to see steps 
taken to uncover the history of operation of North Korea's 
nuclear reactor to ensure no plutonium has been diverted for a 
covert nuclear weapons development program. 
  U.S. officials were quoted as saying the issue may be on the 
agenda of the third round of talks. 
  But the sources said the Japanese Government is not 
optimistic about what may well turn out to a mere replay of 
events, in which North Korea proceeds at its own pace, putting 
off a resolution of the issue. 
  They said that if North Korea is not more forthcoming at the 
talks, the course of events will inevitably lead back to 
consideration of economic sanctions to force Pyongyang into 
compliance with the will of the international community. 
  Clinton said Wednesday that during the period of the talks 
the U.S. will suspend efforts to pursue a sanctions resolution 
in the U.N. Security Council.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
have made steady progress in bilateral trade "framework" talks 
on government procurement, a Japanese official said Thursday [23 
June]. 
  "We are advancing step by step," the official at the Foreign 
Ministry said, briefing reporters on two days of 
subcabinet-level talks that ended Thursday. 
  The official said the latest meeting between Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshevsky took up every topic under the government 
procurement category of the framework negotiations. 
  The subjects for talks included the most sensitive issue of 
how to set "quantitative criteria" as a way to gauge the 
openness of Japan's market, the official added. 
  Talks on the framework's government procurement area 
comprise 
medical equipment and telecommunications equipment. No U.S. 
trade officials could be reached for comment on the latest 
meeting. 
  The Japanese official said the high-level talks were held on 
the basis of Japanese proposals shown in a market-opening 
package in March. 
  "It would not be correct to say the Japanese side has been 
120 percent satisfied with the results of the two-day 
discussion," the official said. 
  But he added, "mutual understanding has been deepened." 
  The official said the latest talks gave him impression that 
the spirit of a may agreement between Japan and the U.S. to 
resume the long-suspended framework talks is "still alive." 
  He was referring to the accord that clarified Washington's 
pledge not to seek any "numerical targets" in restarted 
framework talks. 
  The official acknowledged both parties are still divided 
over 
the treatment of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) 
under telecom trade talks. 
  "Japan and the U.S. have remained unchanged in their basic 
stance on the matter," the official said. 
  Tokyo has insisted that NTT, a private company, should not 
be 
included in the agenda of the bilateral government procurement 
talks while the U.S. has proposed differently, saying the 
Japanese telecom giant is partly owned by the government. 
  The official said the two countries are likely to hold 
working-level talks on government procurement in Washington next 
week or the week after next, in order to keep the talks moving 
ahead, the official said. 
  Government procurement is one of the three priority trade 
sectors under the framework talks along with insurance and trade 
in auto and auto parts. 
  Trade talks on the three areas recently resumed after a 
hiatus of three and a half months following the rupture of the 
summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton in February.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion 
Thursday [23 June] to the House of Representatives against the 
government of Prime Minister Hata shortly after the Diet passed 
the overdue budget for fiscal 1994. 
  The LDP decided to submit the motion during its Executive 
Council meeting Wednesday, saying the government has not made 
sufficient efforts to clarify former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's suspected personal financial irregularities. 
  If the lower house approves the motion, Hata must either 
resign en masse with his cabinet or dissolve the house for a 
snap general election. 
  But it is not clear whether the LDP will have the support 
from the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
needed to muster a majority of votes to pass the motion. 
  The SDP, which split from the ruling alliance in April, 
indicated earlier it may join the LDP in pushing the motion but 
displayed willingness Wednesday to mend frayed ties with the 
coalition. 
  Hata and SDP head Tomiichi Murayama were scheduled to meet 
later Thursday to discuss a possible realliance. 
  The LDP and the ruling coalition are courting the SDP since 
both sides are short of a majority in the Diet. 
  The LDP urged the SDP earlier Thursday to hold a meeting of 
the two parties' leaders to discuss a plan to set up a new 
government. 
  The current Diet session ends next Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Thursday indicated the possibility of stepping down with his 
entire cabinet to fashion a fresh coalition government and 
tackle a host of formidable domestic and foreign policy 
challenges. Hata, 58, said he is ready to disband his cabinet 
if it is necessary to bring the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a 
former member of the ruling coalition, back to the fold. The 
coalition and the SDP are currently holding rounds of realliance 
talks. 
  "I would like to leave (everything), including the issue of 
my resignation, to the decision of the talks," he said at a news 
conference. Today, we are in an extremely difficult situation," 
Hata said. "It is tremendously important to form a powerful 
government in order to get through this difficulty." 
  Hata met the press shortly after the long-overdue fiscal 
1994 
budget cleared the Diet and the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) filed a no-confidence motion against the 
Hata government. 
  The premier said he will relay his intention to SDP 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama when they meet later Thursday to 
weigh the option of forming a new coalition government with the 
SDP's participation. 
  The SDP, the largest contingent in the last government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, walked out of the ruling 
coalition in late April, forcing Hosokawa's successor, Hata, to 
form Japan's first minority administration since 1955. 
  The coalition is prepared to accept in principle the terms 
for the SDP's return. One last hurdle is the SDP's demand that 
the Hata cabinet resign en masse before the formation of a new 
administration. 
  On the LDP's submission of a no-confidence motion, Hata 
countered he has exerted strong leadership to deal with numerous 
tasks for the sake of Japanese livelihoods since assuming office 
two month ago. 
  Hata renewed his opposition to the idea of holding the next 
general election under the current multiseat electoral system, 
which is soon to be replaced by a new system combining 
single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. 
  ``Now is not the time to contest an election under the 
present multiseat system,'' because a government panel will 
shortly finish its task of redrawing a new electoral map for the 
House of Representatives, he said. 
  Although the Diet legislated in January a package of 
electoral reform bills for the lower house, the additional 
passage of a yet-unformed redistricting bill is required to 
allow the next election to be lawfully contested under the new 
system. 
  But he also said he has no intention of waiving his right to 
dissolve the lower house as head of government. 
  ``The last resort for the premier when facing off with 
parliament is to exercise the right to dissolve (the lower 
house),'' Hata said. ''And I cannot deny this.''

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The shaky ruling coalition 
of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and the former partner Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] were nearing agreement 
in their crucial reconciliation talks Thursday [23 June], with 
speculation rife on the probability of Hata's resignation, 
political sources said. 
  Jockeying among key political parties entered the last 
stretch amid a looming possibility of agreement on realliance 
being reached at a meeting later in the day between Hata and SDP 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama. 
  The SDP, which split from the coalition in April in protest 
against maneuvering by its partners to create a new Diet bloc 
excluding the SDP, confirmed earlier in the day the party's 
policy of demanding Hata's resignation as a condition for its 
rejoining the fold. 
  Murayama is expected to urge Hata, who leads the first 
minority government in four decades, to resign along with his 
ministers at the planned meeting, coalition and SDP sources said. 
  Hata has so far rejected the call, but some coalition 
lawmakers Thursday voiced the view that he will announce his 
bowing out to pave the way for an early realliance. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition 
bloc, is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the 
Hata cabinet after the budget passes the Diet later in the day. 
  The SDP turned down the LDP proposal for talks to form a 
joint government in a clear signal that it places top priority 
on the bid to rejoin hands with the coalition. 
  The SDP-coalition negotiations, based on the SDP's policy 
outline put forth Wednesday, centered on the bills for redrawing 
an electoral map in line with the political reform law passed in 
January and the proposed hike of the consumption tax. 
  The coalition called for an extension of the term for the 
current Diet session, which expires next Wednesday, for the 
passage of the bills, while the socialists argued it should be 
delayed to the next session, the sources said. 
  On the consumption tax, the coalition sought an SDP 
agreement 
to specify the size of the hike, but the socialists, who 
strongly objected to the introduction of the tax, rejected the 
request. 
  Meanwhile, Hata expressed strong hope for an SDP return to 
his camp. 
  "I would be happy if we can move toward a new politics along 
with the SDP. We have a seat open for them," Hata told a House 
of Councillors Budget Committee session. 
  In the face of growing prospects for the SDP's return to 
the ruling camp, three small reformist groups decided thursday 
to refuse any overtures to join the coalition unless it is made 
clear that the SDP will supply the prime minister. 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which also broke ranks with 
the coalition, the Group Seiun, a splinter group from the Japan 
New Party (JNP), and Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind), another 
JNP defector club, also called for fresh policy-making talks 
among all the parties that have accepted invitations to join the 
coalition. 
  A senior Sakigake legislator, Hiroyuki Sonoda, in telephone 
talks with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, said the SDP's 
policy outline is acceptable. 
  ``Sakigake would respond positively if the SDP tries to 
create a new coalition with Murayama as its head,'' he told Kubo. 
  Another Sakigake kingpin, Shusei Tanaka, told a press 
conference that the SDP's move to talk not only with the 
coalition but also with the LDP indicates the socialists have a 
radical realignment of the coalition in mind.

government. NHK reporter Kusada will report on their talks from 
the Diet. 
  [Begin Kusada recording] The third round of talks between

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and the head of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, 
SDPJ], a former coalition member, failed Thursday to find common 
ground to patch together the severed ties between the ruling 
coalition and the SDP. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that talks 
with 
Hata did not bear fruit because sessions between the two sides 
over policy pacts are still continuing. 
  Coalition parties and the SDP, which are holding talks 
toward 
forming a policy agreement, could not find any middle ground in 
their reconciliation talks that would pave the way for the SDP 
to rejoin the alliance, official sources said. 
  Although Hata indicated Thursday that his minority cabinet 
would resign en masse, a condition the SDP has demanded for 
returning to the fold, off-and-on sessions between the two sides 
aimed at achieving a policy accord before forming a new 
coalition, hit an impasse over differences on tax reform, the 
sources said. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told reporters the party 
cannot immediately agree on the tax reform issue, including a 
hike in the current 3 percent consumption tax rate. 
  The coalition sought an SDP agreement to specify the size of 
the hike, but the socialists, who objected to the introduction 
of the tax, rejected the request. 
  The minority coalition and the SDP will continue to discuss 
the matter Friday, the sources said. 
  On Hata's remarks that he is ready to step down with all his 
cabinet ministers, Kubo said he takes the statement seriously 
and urged Hata to resign voluntarily en masse. 
  At a press conference after the long-overdue fiscal 1994 
budget cleared the Diet, Hata, 58, said he is ready to disband 
his cabinet if it is necessary to bring the SDP, a primary force 
in the previous coalition administration led by Morihiro 
Hosokawa, back to the camp. 
  The House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee, 
meanwhile, failed to set the timetable for the lower house to 
hold a plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion against 
the Hata cabinet, which was submitted Thursday by the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has said the minority 
administration does not reflect people's views. 
  The LDP, which was ousted by the coalition last August after 
dominating Japanese politics for 38 years, demanded that the 
lower chamber take a floor vote on the no-confidence motion on 
Friday but the coalition opposed it, saying talks with the SDP 
are continuing, the sources said. 
  It depends on SDP members whether the no-confidence motion 
passes the lower house, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
failed on Thursday [23 June] to resolve his differences with 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) chief Tomiichi Murayama on the 
course of the SDP's return to the governing coalition. 
  Hata repeated his stance in a meeting with Murayama, who 
asked him to clarify his earlier remarks indicating the 
possibility of disbanding his cabinet so as to lure the SDP back 
into the fold, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told 
reporters. 
  Saying Japan needs a powerful government to tackle difficult 
problems such as tax and political reforms, Hata reportedly told 
Murayama he will entrust the issue of his resignation to the 
ongoing talks between the coalition and the SDP. 
  These talks "have yet to be completed and will be resumed at 
11 A.M. [0200 GMT] Tomorrow," Murayama told a separate news 
conference. 
  Murayama declined comment on Hata's suggestion of his 
resignation, the key condition for the SDP's return, saying the 
talks are still in process. 
  The SDP chief said the result of negotiations on the SDP's 
possible return to power should be known "in a day or two," as 
the current Diet session ends next Wednesday and the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) filed a no-confidence 
motion against the Hata cabinet. 
  During the meeting with Murayama at his official residence, 
Hata urged the SDP, the main bloc in the government of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, to rejoin the ruling alliance, 
Murayama said. 
  The SDP walked out of the coalition in late April in protest 
at the formation by other major coalition partners of a new 
parliamentary group excluding the SDP, forcing Hata to form 
Japan's first minority government in 39 years. 
  The SDP chairman said Hata pressed a demand for the 
clarification of the reason for the SDP's withdrawal from the 
coalition. 
  Murayama told Hata the SDP did not leave the coalition in 
April because of differences in policies but because of "other 
problems," alluding to the formation of a large parliamentary 
group excluding the SDP, according to Kumagai. 
  But Hata and Murayama agreed to watch the progress of the 
talks between the coalition parties and the SDP, Murayama and 
Kumagai said. 
  The ruling coalition and the SDP are currently holding talks 
toward reaching a policy agreement in forming a new government. 
The main point of contention is tax system reform, on which the 
two sides are still far apart. 
  The SDP is opposed to a hike in the current 3 percent 
consumption tax in return for large-scale income and residential 
tax cuts in 1995 and beyond. 
  The government is scheduled to chart a final course for a 
comprehensive tax system reform by the end of June and act on 
necessary legislation by the year's end. 
  At a press conference shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget 
cleared the Diet and the LDP filed a no-confidence motion 
against the Hata cabinet, Hata indicated the possibility of 
stepping down with his entire cabinet. 
  Hata told Murayama that the coalition parties have overcome 
many difficulties since first coming to power last August and 
that he wants to maintain the framework of the coalition, 
Kumagai said. 
  The chief cabinet secretary said Hata and Murayama did not 
discuss whether they would meet again. They also did not discuss 
a cabinet resignation en masse or how to deal with the 
no-confidence motion, Kumagai said. 
  Meanwhile, the House of Representatives Diet Steering 
Committee failed to set a timetable for the lower house to hold 
a plenary session to vote on the no-confidence motion. 
  The LDP, toppled from government last summer for the first 
time in 38 years, claimed Hata's minority administration does 
not reflect people's views. The LDP demanded the lower chamber 
take a floor vote on the no-confidence motion Friday but the 
coalition opposed it.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The upper house budget 
committee on Thursday approved a long-delayed state budget for 
fiscal 1994, which started on April 1, which will go for passage 
at the house's plenary session later in the day. The approval 
of the 73.1 trillion yen state budget at the House of 
Councillors committee followed passage at the House of 
Representatives on June 8, 70 days overdue and three months 
after its was tabled in the Diet. 
  Diet debate on the budget, which was submitted to parliament 
on March 4, became snarled in a political squabble over former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's personal financial affairs. 
Hosokawa stepped down in April because of the turmoil. 
  The nation's full spending budget includes 5.5 trillion yen 
for cuts in income and residential taxes to stimulate the 
economy. 
  Despite tight fiscal conditions, expenditures for public 
works projects were increased by 29.8 percent from the previous 
year to 11.1 trillion yen. Public works spending accounts for 
15.2 percent of the 40.9 trillion yen general operating 
expenditures, the core part of the budget that includes most 
outlays other than debt-servicing costs and tax allocations to 
local governments. Defense spending, in contrast, was raised by 
a scant 0.9 percent to 4.7 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The long-overdue fiscal 
1994 state budget became law Thursday [23 June], nearly three 
months after it should have come into force. 
  The House of Councillors gave a stamp of approval to the 
73.1 
trillion yen budget for the year that started April 1 at a 
plenary session after its budget committee cleared it earlier in 
the day. 
  Only three budgets took longer to enact than the fiscal 1994 
budget during the postwar period. 
  The government's budget plan was tabled in the Diet on March 
4 but had been left undebated for 80 days due to the political 
maelstrom over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
personal financial affairs. The turmoil forced Hosokawa to step 
down in April. 
  But once deliberations started, the budget took an unusually 
short 23 days to become law. 
  The budget earmarks 40.9 trillion yen, or 2.3 percent more 
than the fiscal 1993 budget, for general operating expenditures, 
the core part of the budget that includes most outlays other 
than debt-servicing costs and tax allocations to local 
governments. 
  It features 5.5 trillion yen in income and residential tax 
reductions and sets aside 8.98 trillion yen, a 4.0 percent rise, 
for public works spending, both designed to shore up the ailing 
economy. 
  Outlays for defense are allowed to rise a scant 0.9 percent 
to 4.7 trillion yen while official development assistance was 
budgeted at 1.0 trillion yen, a 4.4 percent increase.

  [Text] The House of Representatives overwhelmingly 
approved a bill Thursday [23 June] to reduce the current 6.5 to 
1 disparity in the weight of a vote in various House of 
Councillors constituencies to 5 to 1. 
  The House of Councillors approved the bill Wednesday. 
  The amendment bill cleared the lower chamber's plenary 
session with the backing of almost all political parties and 
parliamentary groups except the Japanese Communist Party. 
  An upper house poll in the summer of 1995 will be held under 
the new electoral system. 
  The bill adds one seat to each of four underrepresented 
upper 
chamber constituencies in Miyagi, Saitama, Kanagawa and Gifu 
prefectures, while taking away two seats from the 
overrepresented Hokkaido electorate and one each from the 
prefectures of Hyogo and Fukuoka, legislators said. 
  The bill alleviates the current situation under which some 
relatively sparsely populated constituencies have more 
representation in the upper house than more densely populated 
constituencies, mainly in or near urban areas. 
  The amendment was submitted after a 1993 Osaka High Court 
ruling that the current maximum disparity of 6.48 to 1 violates 
the constitutional principle of equality for all under the law, 
the legislators said. 
  The amendment would reduce the maximum disparity to 4.81 to 
1, they said. 
  The bill was initially introduced in the upper chamber under 
the cosponsorship of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan], Komeito [Clean Government Party], 
the Niin Club and the Shin Ryokufu Kai -- a parliamentary group 
comprising the Democratic Socialist Party, the Japan New Party, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Democratic Reform Party. 
  Goken Liberal No Kai, a five-legislator group of the upper 
chamber, balked at the bill, saying it is not enough to 
accomplish fairness in voting power.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives committee on discipline voted Thursday [23 June] 
to order former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi to formally 
apologize in the Diet for his unruly actions at a lower house 
budget committee meeting last Friday. 
  Yamaguchi, a legislator without party affiliation, threw 
water at the seat of budget committee chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi 
to protest the committee's decision to summon former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for questioning over his financial 
affairs. Yamaguchi is not a committee member. 
  "His behavior essentially deserves barring from the house, 
but he also expressed some feelings of regret," Yoshio Yatsu, a 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator, said in explaining 
the light punishment. 
  All committee members from the two main opposition groups, 
the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, voted for the motion. 
  The lower house is expected to adopt the committee's order 
for Yamaguchi to apologize at its next plenary session, which 
may be held as soon as Friday. 
  The House of Representatives decided earlier in the day to 
bring Yamaguchi before the committee on discipline for his 
misbehavior. 
  The last time disciplinary measures were taken against a 
lower house member was in June 1973, when Japanese Communist 
Party legislator Masako Kobayashi was barred from the chamber 
for 20 days.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Many mid-level government 
officials questioned believe it is time politicians exert 
stronger leadership to rein in Japan's central bureaucracy, but 
fewer believe there will be major change over the next 10 years, 
the National Personnel Authority said in a report released 
Wednesday [22 June]. 
  The Authority asked 102 division deputy director-class 
officials at ministries and agencies to judge the relationship 
between politicians and the administration. These young and 
prospective officials have received the Authority's 
administrative training from January to April. 
  Seventy-seven percent said "There are problems under the 
present conditions" and urged a change in the relationship, 50 
percent cited "weak political leadership over the 
administration" as a problem, and 49 percent supported the 
statement that "The administration interferes with matters which 
should be handled by politicians." Eighteen percent said that 
political pressure is "too high." 
  Multiple answers were allowed, so responses add up to more 
than 100 percent. 
  But only 17 percent voiced optimism that the political world 
will actually undergo major change during the next 10 years, 
while just 6 percent said so for the administration. 
  "Certain changes" in politics are anticipated by 54 percent, 
and in the administrative sphere by 45 percent. Almost a third 
believe that nothing will change in politics, while 49 percent 
fear that the administrative system will remain the same. 
  "The answers show that there is hope for a change of the 
current conditions as well as the awareness that such change 
will be difficult to realize," an authority official said in 
analyzing the survey results.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Japan's largest supermarket 
chain Daiei Inc., applying for Chinese Government approval to 
operate across the country, will open an outlet in Shanghai next 
year, its president Isao Nakauchi said Thursday [23 June]. 
  Another major Japanese supermarket chain Yaohan 
International 
Group headquartered in Hong Kong, opened an outlet in Shanghai 
in May and has announced it will open 1,000 more outlets in the 
area from Shanghai to Beijing. 
  However, Daiei is the first Japanese supermarket chain 
eyeing 
nationwide operations in China. 
  Learning China plans to give a license for nationwide 
operations to only one or two foreign retailers, Nakauchi said 
he recently visited the country and applied for a license. 
  Daiei will pump about 3 billion yen into the planned 
Shanghai 
outlet, which is going to be a full-scale supermarket store to 
serve as a pilot outlet on Chinese soil, he said. 
  Daiei will establish joint ventures with Chinese companies, 
Nakauchi said, adding that Shanghai is now examining candidate 
Chinese firms. 
  He said he has not decided on the number of outlets to be 
opened in the country, although some industry people estimate 
the number will be around 300. 
  Industry sources said China will decide on a license after 
seeing how Daiei's Shanghai outlet does. There are competitors 
from the United States and Europe also applying for licenses, 
they added.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Nomura Securities Co. 
business group is promoting a project to develop a big 
industrial zone in Vietnam and invite scores of Japanese 
companies such as electric machinery makers. 
  In early June, a Nomura-Jafco Investment Asia Ltd.(NjIA), a 
Singapore-based investment firm, reached a basic agreement with 
the authorities of Haiphong, near Hanoi, to conduct a 
feasibility study on a development project on a 170-hectare site. 
  The first stage of the project calls for a study on 
infrastructure, like supplies of electric power, water and 
telephones. 
  NJIA, which is equally owned by Nomura and Japan Associated 
Finance Co. (Jafco), a finance company in the Nomura group, will 
set up a joint venture with the authorities in September, an 
official at Nomura said. 
  It will be the first project by a group to construct such a 
large industrial zone in Vietnam. 
  "Vietnam is expected to see high economic growth in the near 
future. We would like to call on companies which have missed 
the bus for investment in China to come," the official said. 
  Japanese manufacturers of electric machinery, car parts, 
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals are expected to build factories in 
the area, he said. 
  Nomura, which is financing all costs in constructing the 
zone, will accept land-lease fees from those companies.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan's Rice Retailers 
Association moved Wednesday [22 June] to virtually boycott Thai 
rice which is unpopular among Japanese consumers. 
  The group submitted a petition to the Food Agency to allow 
it 
to buy Thai rice from wholesalers according to their needs, 
agency sources said. 
  The Food Agency will decide on its attitude to the rice 
retailer's petition after examining the rice sales situation in 
June, an agency official said. 
  Thai rice is unpopular on the domestic market chiefly 
because 
its grain type is not suitable for traditional Japanese meals. 
  The sources quoted the head of the nationwide rice 
retailers' 
group as saying retailers have been piling up stocks of unsold 
Thai rice and do not have any solution on how to reduce them. 
  Japan broke a longstanding rice import ban this year to make 
up for supply shortages caused by a poor domestic harvest last 
year due to a cool, rainy summer. 
  On Tuesday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister 
Mutsuki Kato said rice import contracts have been signed for a 
total of 2,545,000 tons so far and no more contracts will be 
concluded. 
  China was the biggest exporter with 1.07 million tons, 
followed by Thailand with 753,000 tons, the United States with 
537,000 tons and Australia with 183,000 tons. 
  The Food Agency, which regulates rice production and 
directly 
supervises imports and distribution, has instructed wholesalers 
to sell domestic rice and foreign rice in a set at a certain 
proportion. 
  In the case of Thai rice, the ratio was 20 percent a set 
when 
imported rice was put on market in March. The ratio was then 
reduced to 10 percent in May. 
  However, according to retailers, consumers often leave Thai 
rice at the shops even though they have paid for a whole set. 
  There have been resales of Thai rice on an unauthorized 
market at lower prices -- often below 50 yen per kilogram, which 
is cheaper than one quarter of the government-set price, the 
retailers said. 
  There are even supermarkets offering Thai rice for free to 
consumers, or groups of people planning to donate it to 
countries with food shortages, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Money rates remained 
unchanged in Tokyo on Thursday [23 June] as the Bank of Japan 
took an almost neutral monetary stance. 
  In interbank trading, the unsecured overnight call rate was 
traded at 2 2/32 to 2 3/32 percent. 
  On the open market, the rate on newly issued three-month 
certificates of deposit was offered around 2.11-2.13 percent. 
  Considering the yen's recent gain against the dollar, the 
central bank's supply of funds was rather smaller than expected, 
said a dealer at a Japanese commercial bank. 
  Some expect the central bank to continue its monetary stance 
to stabilize longer-term interest rates for some time. 
  A dealer at a long-term credit bank said, "It will be a long 
time before the Bank of Japan tries to lead interest rates lower 
to check the yen's appreciation." 
  The bank of Japan injected 300 billion yen into the market 
by 
purchasing one-week discount bills worth 200 billion yen and by 
lending 100 billion yen to commercial banks, against the 
projected shortage of 320 billion yen for the day. 
  As of Wednesday, reserves by commercial banks in the central 
bank coffers were 300 billion yen over the required amount.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
said Wednesday [23 June] the recent appreciation of the Japanese 
yen was not sufficiently reflected in retail prices of domestic 
and imported products. 
  The commission said the report was based on a comparison of 
polls taken from retailers last October and a year earlier on 10 
items in four categories, including confectionery, coffee, 
cosmetics and sports balls. 
  The survey showed that retail prices remained unchanged for 
70 percent of chocolate items imported by importing agencies and 
sold at department stores, the commission said. 
  Retailers refrained from bringing down prices of these items 
because of rising advertising costs, it said. 
  Prices of domestically made biscuits failed to decline 
because of government regulations on raw materials such as wheat 
and sugar. 
  Prices declined for nearly 90 percent of imported lipstick 
and slightly less than 60 percent of makeup foundations which 
were sold at department stores. 
  There was no major change in retail prices of domestically 
made cosmetics because most of them were sold at prices 
recommended by manufacturers, the commission said. 
  The commission said it will continue to monitor price 
movements and warned makers and import agencies to refrain from 
resorting to excessive measures to regulate retail prices of 
their products.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Business lobbies from Japan 
and the United States on Thursday [23 June] jointly urged that 
Japan's current account surplus be reduced to less than 2 
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). 
  The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai 
Doyukai) and the Committee for Economic Development (CED) also 
agreed on their opposition to the setting of specific targets 
for Japan's imports from the U.S. 
  However, they said such targets would be effective if used 
in 
unbinding ways to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. 
  In a statement that described the Japan-U.S. relationship as 
the most important partnership in the world, the groups called 
on Japan to open its market and reduce its external imbalance. 
  The statement said the ratio of Japan's current account 
surplus to its GDP should be brought down to around 2 percent in 
fiscal 1997 and less than that thereafter. 
  Japan's current account surplus accounted for more than 3 
percent of the GDP in fiscal 1993 ended March 31. 
  The statement also requested more than 100 trillion yen be 
added to Japan's 430 trillion yen public works program for this 
decade.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday [23 June] steady implementation of stimulus 
measures is needed to prevent a rapid strengthening of the yen. 
  The premier made the remarks at the House of Councillors 
Budget Committee amid recent sharp gains by the yen against the 
U.S. dollar. 
  "Enacting the national budget for the current fiscal year 
and 
promoting deregulation should stabilize foreign exchange rates," 
Hata said. 
  The 73.1 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 was to be 
approved at an upper house plenary session later in the day. 
  Hata also told the committee that the government is taking 
appropriate measures against the currency turmoil by maintaining 
close contact with the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Leaders of Japanese 
small-business groups on Thursday [23 June] urged the government 
to take strong remedial measures against the unabated strength 
of the yen against the dollar, a Trade Ministry official said. 
  The latest surge of the yen is chilling the sentiment of 
managers at small companies at a time when the Japanese economy 
is showing signs of picking up, the leaders of the four groups 
told International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, the 
official said. 
  The four groups, including the National Federation of Small 
Business Associations, made the request during a breakfast 
meeting with Hata and other top officials at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI). 
  The groups called for strong dollar-buying market 
intervention by Japan and other major countries as one way to 
help arrest the yen's upswing, the MITI official told reporters. 
  Hata told the business leaders he is gravely concerned about 
possible serious effects of the strong yen on small companies. 
  MITI will do its best to help small firms tide over the 
strong yen, Hata was quoted as saying.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Thursday [23 June] his ministry will continue 
tightening its belt in forming the budget for the next fiscal 
year. 
  "It's too early to decide" on the next budget, but "we must 
continue promoting fiscal reforms," Fujii told a press meeting 
after the long-delayed budget for fiscal 1994, which started 
April 1, passed the Diet. 
  Fujii also said his ministry must avoid issuing 
deficit-covering bonds and should continue pursuing efficient 
budget allocations. 
  Brushing aside any intention to present new fiscal measures 
ahead of the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading 
industrialized nations in Naples, Fujii repeated that it is now 
"most important" to steadily implement the outlays in the budget 
for the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package approved by the Diet 
in February. 
  The outlays include 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A top life insurance 
industry official Friday blasted a government report on postal 
insurance for proposing making postal life insurance more 
competitive with private-sector products. 
  Speaking in the capacity of chairman of the Life Insurance 
Association of japan, Toshiomi Uragami told reporters that the 
proposal runs counter to the law governing postal life insurance 
that limits services. 
  "This could help give more power to the bureaucracy," said 
Uragami, who is also president of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. 
  The report, prepared by a study group for the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications, says postal life insurance is 
serving to promote competition in the oligopolistic life 
insurance market. 
  Commenting also on a series of damage suits filed by 
variable 
life insurance policyholders against life insurance firms, 
Uragami said each life insurance company should have explained 
the feature of variable life insurance, and noted that the 
industry is reviewing a text on the subject for sales personnel. 
  Variable life insurance policies are investment-oriented 
policies that provide a return linked to an underlying portfolio 
of securities. 
  Variable life insurance was a big hit in the so-called 
bubble 
era in the late 1980s when a booming stock market held the 
promise of higher returns. 
  But with the stock market crumbling since, many 
policyholders 
facing huge losses have filed damages suits against life 
insurance firms.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
issued a report Tuesday [21 June] that offered no specific 
figures, but broad options to enable the minority government of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to decide quickly on globally 
promised tax reform while avoiding unnecessary political 
disputes. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, handed the report 
to Hata, leaving sufficient time for the government and the 
ruling coalition parties to keep promises made in the March 
market-opening package. 
  The promises were to detail tax reform, including 
continuation of 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts, now limited to 
the current year, by the end of this month. Enactment into law 
is seen by the yearend. 
  The report calls for a net revenue surplus to fund an 
expected increase in welfare spending amid a graying society in 
the 21st century by raising the consumption tax to more than 
offset "permanent" tax cuts. 
  On specific figures and dates, the advisory panel to the 
prime minister indirectly endorsed "mechanical calculations" 
prepared by the Finance Ministry on revenue estimates in fiscal 
2001 under the proposed tax reform. 
  The estimates, also provided to the ruling parties, showed 
that only a tax increase to 7 percent or more would secure extra 
revenue. The figure is based on income from tax cuts worth 6.2 
trillion yen and 10-to 20-year redemption for stopgap bonds for 
a three-year lag between the continued cuts and a tax hike in 
April 1997. 
  But the panel also offered tacit acceptance of a tax hike 
below 6 percent, saying that specific figures and dates rest on 
efforts to conduct fiscal and administrative overhauls to win 
taxpayers' support. 
  "The limit under the current fiscal condition is a rise to 7 
percent, and most panel members agreed on this," Kato told a 
news meeting after handing over the report. 
  But he added a tax increase of 6 percent or less is an 
option 
if the prime minister can come up with a strong plan for fiscal 
and administrative reforms. 
  The report also notes some panel members would accept a 
stage 
plan of limiting the tax hike and leaving the issue of net 
revenue surplus for further discussions. 
  "That's why we made unusual commitments as the Tax 
Commission 
to external discussions led by the fiscal and administrative 
reforms," Kato said. 
  The report urges the government to map out "medium-term 
numerical targets and programs" on such reform and to review the 
income and consumption tax systems for more fairness. 
  The panel's inclination to exclude concrete figures 
apparently stemmed from mounting uncertainties on the political 
side, with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
poised to launch a no- confidence motion against Hata's minority 
government. 
  Moreover, the tax hike is an extremely delicate issue for 
the 
Social Democratic Party, which split from the ruling coalition 
in April, resulting in a minority government. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said his ministry wants the 
government and ruling parties to include concrete figures and 
dates for the tax hike and to write the reform into bills by the 
end of the month. 
  Meanwhile, the ruling coalition's tax forum issued its tax 
reform report, also leaving out specific figures for the cuts 
and hike while calling for a heavier burden on taxpayers to cope 
with the aging society and administrative reforms. 
  The forum handed the report to the coalition's policymaking 
group of top representatives. 
  As for ways to cut income taxes, both reports call for 
easing 
burdens on the medium-income brackets of 7 to 10 million yen, 
but differed on whether to lower the ceiling for the maximum tax 
rate. 
  As for a regional consumption tax, both reports put it aside 
for further talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
issued a report Tuesday [21 June] calling for a net revenue 
surplus to fund welfare spending by hiking the consumption tax 
to more than offset multiyear tax cuts. 
  The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, 
left out specific figures which politicians will decide on later 
but showed implications for continuing the 6.2 trillion yen 
income and other tax cuts already implemented this year and 
raising the 3 percent consumption tax to above 6 percent in 
April 1997. 
  In the report, the panel strongly recommended the government 
to offer concrete promises such as "medium-term numerical 
targets and programs" on fiscal and administrative overhauls to 
win taxpayers' support. 
  Commission Chairman Kan Kato handed the report over to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, leaving sufficient time for the 
government and the ruling coalition parties to detail the tax 
reform by the end of this month and enact it into law by the 
year-end. 
  Japan promised the timetable in its March market-opening 
package. 
  But uncertainties are mounting on the political side with 
the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party preparing to launch 
a no-confidence motion against the minority-rule coalition 
government. 
  Apparently to avoid unnecessary political disputes over the 
sensitive issue of raising the sales tax, the panel avoided 
specific figures, and it also spelled out as "minority opinions" 
that the tax hike be limited only to fund the tax cuts while 
leaving the issue of securing a revenue surplus for welfare 
spending toward the 21st century for further discussion.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on 
Wednesday [22 June] passed into law a product liability bill 
designed to protect consumers from accidents caused by defective 
products. 
  The law, which will go into effect next June, will be the 
first of its kind in Japan. 
  The law was passed by the powerful House of Representatives 
June 15. 
  In the course of debates in both chambers, a total of 16 
appendixes were attached to the bill to ease the burden on 
consumers seeking compensation in proving a product is defective. 
  Under the present system, consumers are required to prove 
negligence on the part of producers. 
  The new law leaves the decision on whether a product is 
defective up to the court. 
  Products covered by the law include medicines such as live 
vaccines and blood agents. 
  Manufacturers must now work out new measures to cope with 
future legal action taken by consumers seeking damages and 
compensation, industry officials said. 
  Consumer electronics makers have moved to consolidate and 
realign their in-house legal and intellectual property 
protection departments, they said. 
  Similar moves will be taken by pharmaceutical makers, they 
said. 
  The officials said medium and small enterprises have held 
seminars to get acquainted with the new law.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Wednesday [22 June] hailed the 
enactment of a bill to provide consumers with greater protection 
against accidents and injuries caused by defective products. 
  "The law is in line with the economic and social reality of 
Japan and is also well balanced internationally," Hata said in a 
statement. 
  The product liability bill was passed into law Wednesday by 
the House of Councillors after the second chamber's plenary 
session voted unanimously in favor of the bill. The more 
powerful House of Representatives already passed the bill June 
15. 
  Hata said his ministry will take adequate steps before the 
law goes into effect in one year, including dissemination of the 
law among concerned industries. 
  The product liability law will require consumers seeking 
compensation to simply prove that a product was faulty, rather 
than the present system whereby consumers must prove negligence 
by the maker. 
  But the law does not incorporate a provision holding makers 
liable for damages or injury through assumption of a link 
between the damage or injury and a defective product. 
  It took almost 20 years for the bill to be enacted since the 
Social Policy Council, an advisory body to the prime minister, 
began debate on better consumer protection from defective 
products in 1975.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday Japan cannot call the use of nuclear weapons a 
violation of international law, adding that doing so would risk 
the efficacy of nuclear deterrence. "Japan has relied on the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. If it calls it (the use of nuclear 
arms) unlawful, nuclear deterrence would be rendered 
ineffective," the premier said. 
  Hata made the remarks at a House of Councillors Budget 
Committee session in connection with a statement Japan submitted 
to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on June 10. Japan 
has dropped from the document a phrase saying the use of nuclear 
arms does not violate international law. The country had been 
criticized at home and abroad after reports that it would 
present a document including such a phrase. 
  In spite of the deletion, the government has not changed its 
opinion that the use of nuclear arms cannot be called a 
violation of international law since nuclear deterrence exists. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same session that 
the 
importance of nuclear deterrence cannot yet be denied, pointing 
out that China recently conducted a nuclear test.

  [Text] Honolulu, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's Air Self-Defense 
Force (ASDF) made its debut in the U.S.-led five-nation Rim of 
the Pacific Exercise (Rimpac) this year, sources familiar with 
the military drills said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Two ASDF officers joined the exercise to train in sea-based 
aerial warfare under U.S. Navy guidance, the sources said. 
  The large-scale joint military drills of the United States, 
Japan, South Korea, Canada and Australia were conducted this 
month in the Pacific Ocean between the Hawaiian and the Midway 
Islands. 
  More than 200 aircraft and 50 naval ships, including, for 
the 
first time, the largest Japanese destroyer Kongo equipped with 
the Aegis air defense system participated in the drills. 
  The sources said ASDF officers have never before undergone 
training during a Rimpac maneuver. In the framework of 
bilateral defense cooperation with the U.S., closer links are 
needed between the armies, navies and air forces to realize "the 
desired comprehensive joint strategy," they said. 
  The participation of ASDF personnel "This time was the first 
strategic move to realize that goal," the sources said. 
  The officers were acting as "ambush control officers" aboard 
the Kongo, guiding Japanese fighter aircraft by radar to 
intercept "enemy" combat planes. 
  Under guidance of a U.S. Navy expert, the two officers 
studied how to control and direct the dispatch of fighters from 
aircraft carriers and the launching of ship-to-air missiles, the 
sources said. 
  The Kongo, equipped with the latest radar technology, is the 
MSDF's most advanced combat vessel. 
  In the past, the training of ASDF personnel aboard U.S. 
aircraft equipped with the AWACS (airborne warning and control 
system) during joint military exercises with the U.S. has 
sparked protests from defenders of Japan's postwar Constitution, 
which bans the use or threat of force to settle international 
disputes. 
  They said such training conflicts with the widely accepted 
view that the Constitution rules out collective defense.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- A Japanese Government panel 
on Wednesday [22 June] proposed easing rules and regulations as 
much as possible on safety and maintenance involved in electric 
power generation while maintaining the current security level. 
  The government should pursue a new security policy on 
electric power generation in response to the recent marked 
increase in safety and maintenance levels amid a rapid 
improvement in product quality, the Electricity Utility Industry 
Council, an advisory organ to the trade minister, said. 
  In an interim report presented to International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, the council said the government's 
direct involvement in security of power generation should be 
reduced to a minimum necessary level. 
  How to maintain safety levels should thus basically be left 
to decision by each power supplier, with emphasis put on the 
principle of "self responsibility," the council said. 
  Government controls should be limited to prevention of 
pollution and other areas that affect public safety, it said. 
  Consumers of electricity should also share responsibility in 
maintaining security, the report said. 
  The council recommended further improvement in safety and 
maintenance levels through new technology development. 
  Standardization of power generation facilities and equipment 
should be promoted to upgrade overall security levels, it said.

<F P=106> ["CPRF on S. Korea's Nuke Development" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] called a press 
conference for domestic and foreign reporters here today and 
published a memorandum on the promotion of nuclear arms 
development in a planned way in South Korea and systematic 
abrogation of the North-South joint declaration on 
denuclearization. 
  The memorandum says: 
  The North and the South of Korea, in the joint declaration 
on 
denuclearization, solemnly declared at home and to the world 
that they would use nuclear energy only for a peaceful purpose 
and not possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium-enriching 
facilities. But South Korea, contrary to the declaration, has 
extracted plutonium in secrecy with disguised nuclear 
reprocessing facilities and purchased nuclear material from 
third countries and systematically diverted it to nuclear arms 
development. Worse still, it is now openly claiming that the 
joint declaration on denuclearization signed between the North 
and the South has become invalid in actuality. 
  The memorandum further says: 
  Though South Korea is disguising the post-irradiation test 
facilities in the Taedok complex as peaceful atomic facilities, 
all the data available prove that they are reprocessing 
facilities. 
  South Korea, regarding the introduction of reprocessing 
facilities as "one of the two main axes" of the strategy of 
nuclear bomb development, concluded a contract on technical 
services and supply for the building of reprocessing facilities 
with the S.J.N. Company of France in the 1970s. When the 
contract got infeasible, the "Fifth Republic" introduced 
post-irradiation test facilities from the company under the 
crafty cloak of "chemical treatment substitution program." They 
completed the building of the facilities in November 1985 and 
put them into full-dressed operation in 1987. 
  The post-irradiation test facilities are, to all intents and 
purposes, reprocessing facilities equipped with the structure 
and processes necessary for the extraction of plutonium, that 
is, facilities designed to put spent fuel strong in 
radioactivity into the shields, transport, dissolve and cut it 
by remote control and analyze and separate it. 
  The South Korean authorities, in league with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], have systematically 
reprocessed at the post-irradiation test facilities 
insufficiently spent fuel discharged from the pressurized heavy 
water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor and 
extracted a large amount of plutonium every year. According to 
preliminary data, the total quantity of extracted plutonium 
amounts to 50 kilograms. Nevertheless, the IAEA has closed its 
eyes to the post-irradiation test facilities of South Korea, 
while making a case of our radiochemical laboratory which is 
peaceful nuclear facilities. 
  South Korea has also imported in secrecy plutonium necessary 
for nuclear arms development from long ago. 
  No sooner had the chief executive of the "Sixth Republic" 
issued "declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean 
peninsula and building of peace" on November 8, 1991 than he 
concluded a "joint agreement on reprocessing" with the United 
Kingdom and allowed a special office of the UK to be set up in 
Seoul. The "agreement" stipulates that spent nuclear fuel 
discharged from atomic reactors of South Korea should be 
transferred to reprocessing plants of the UK to extract 
plutonium, which should be carried back to South Korea. 
  Under this "agreement," South Korea is shipping in [word 
indistinct] dioxide of plutonium and uranium. 
  Foreign media express strong concern over this move of South 
Korea, saying it is evident that South Korea is going to follow 
in the footsteps of Japan which intends to stockpile as much as 
84 tons of plutonium by 2010. 
  South Korea is trying to legitimize and enlarge the 
introduction of plutonium from abroad. 
  The South Korean authorities began to promote the 
development 
of a fast breeder reactor entering the 1980s and recently chose 
a remodeled light water reactor and announced that they would 
complete the designing by 2001 and put it into operation by 2007. 
  By the development of "a remodeled light water reactor using 
plutonium as nuclear fuel" they mean to continue to produce and 
introduce a large amount of plutonium by diverting world public 
attention elsewhere. 
  They have also laid artificial hurdles in the way of 
implementing "joint declaration on the denuclearisation of the 
Korean peninsula" which the North and the South adopted and 
effectuated reflecting the unanimous desire and will of the 
entire fellow countrymen. 
  Especially, the present South Korean authorities have worked 
in a planned and systematic way to destroy it. They first 
argued for "nullification in principle" of the joint declaration 
on the denuclearisation over the "nuclear issue" of the North 
and then asserted that it was "abrogated in fact" and at last 
declared it "practically null and void," reducing it to a mere 
sheet of paper. 
  The South Korean authorities are calling for "nuclear 
sovereignty" and "counterdevelopment of nuclear weapons" and 
resorting to despicable acts to conceal the reality of their 
nuclear armament. 
  The South Korean authorities must open to the public the 
amount of plutonium they have illegally secured and immediately 
shut down the post-irradiation test facilities, that is, 
reprocessing facilities. 
  The memorandum strongly protests with the IAEA against its 
application of a double standard.

<F P=106> ["Third-Round DPRK-USA Talks To Be Held in Early July" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry answered a question put by KCNA today 
regarding the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks expected to be 
held. 
  He said: 
  Some time ago, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song received 
former U.S. President Mr. Jimmy Carter and had a sincere talk 
with him for hours over matters of common concern. 
  He told Mr. Carter that the key to a solution of the nuclear 
issue was to build confidence between the DPRK and the United 
States. And he made an important proposal to break the present 
deadlock between the DPRK and the United States and reach a 
fundamental solution of the nuclear issue. 
  On this basis, a series of working contacts were made 
between 
the DPRK and the U.S. recently to hold the third round of talks. 
  Robert Gallucci, head of the U.S. side's delegation to the 
DPRK-U.S. talks, in a letter to his counterpart of our side 
June 20 confirmed the question of laying a groundwork for the 
talks and proposed to hold the third-round talks to discuss the 
guarantee of security and overall political and economic issues 
between the DPRK and the United States. 
  The head of our side in his reply letter June 22 confirmed 
well-intentioned measures to be taken by us for the third-round 
talks and agreed to the U.S. side's proposal. 
  In the letter we emphasized our stand that "sanctions" and 
dialogue are incompatible. 
  On June 22, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed welcome 
toward our stand and said the discussion of "sanctions" against 
us at the UN Security Council would be withdrawn formally and 
they would come out to the third-round talks. 
  The third-round DPRK-U.S. talks are expected to be held in 
Geneva in the first week of July. 
  We expect that the third-round talks will be held on a fair 
and equal basis so that a substantial agreement may be reached 
for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue and for the 
improvement of relations between the DPRK and the United States 
as a whole.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The New War Provocation </F>
Maneuver That Has Reached a Grave Stage"] 
  [Text] According to reports, U.S. nuclear submarines have 
been strengthening espionage activities near our country's 
coast. The U.S. nuclear submarines are frantically engaged in 
espionage on us by frequently going in and out of the White 
Beach base of the U.S. Navy in Okinawa, its Sasebo base in 
Nagasaki Prefecture, and the Yokosuka port of Japan. 
  Foreign media reported that the U.S. nuclear submarines, 
which are navigating along the shores of our county, specialize 
in collecting information about the communications network of 
our Armed Forces and eavesdropping on radio communications. 
This is an extremely dangerous military move. 
  As everyone knows, the United States has persistently 
carried 
out espionage against for a long time. Reconnaissance 
satellites and planes were the major means of their espionage in 
the past, but they are now mobilizing nuclear submarines as an 
additional means. 
  This clearly proves that U.S. espionage against us has 
become 
more active and the scale of its activities has been 
extraordinarily extended. It also hints that the U.S. new war 
provocation maneuver against us has reached a very grave stage. 
  The United States has systemically extended and strengthened 
its military threat and pressure against us in the past by using 
the nuclear suspicion of us as a pretext. The United States has 
recently deployed Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters 
to South Korea, despite the world's strong protest and 
denunciation; strengthened U.S.-Japanese-South Korean military 
conspiracy and collusion against us; and carried out various war 
exercises, including the Rimpac war exercise. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. hard-liners, conservatives, and bellicose 
military circles have been strengthening adventurous military 
maneuvers, openly talking about military measures, under the 
pretext of the so-called nuclear suspicion about us. 
  As has been reported, U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry 
ordered the aircraft carrier Independence to remain in waters 
where it can intercede in a war on the Korean peninsula. In 
addition, the U.S. Department of Defense has increased special 
strike armed forces -- including squadrons of aircraft carriers, 
tactic planes, and B-52 strategic fighter-bombers -- in South 
Korea and in the region around it in preparation for a possible 
war on the Korean peninsula. It also ordered U.S. tactical 
plane squadrons in Germany and Alaska to assume a stand-by 
posture so they can immediately arrive at the Korean peninsula 
at any time. 
  These military maneuvers by the U.S. warmongers and their 
frenzied espionage against us by mobilizing even nuclear 
submarines, proves, leaving no room for controversy, that they 
have intentionally accelerated a new war provocation maneuver to 
crush us by using the suspicion of our nonexistent nuclear 
development as a pretext. 
  The current situation on the Korean peninsula is entering a 
very dangerous phase and a breaking point because of the U.S. 
adventurous war maneuvers. 
  The United States should contemplate the grave consequences 
that will result from its worthless new war provocation maneuver. 
  We are not afraid of any pressure or military adventure by 
the United States. As we declared on many occasions, we are 
ready for both dialogue and war. If the United States continues 
to adhere to its adventurous military maneuvers and seeks to 
provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula, in spite of our 
repeated warnings, that will bring it ruin far more miserable 
than the Korean war did. 
  Our people value peace, but do not beg for it in return for 
having the country's sovereignty and the national dignity be 
infringed upon. If the United States conducts a military 
adventure to crush us under the pretext of the nuclear issue, 
our people, who regard independence as their lives, will sternly 
counter it and give it a due punishment.

  [Text] According to news reports, U.S. hard-line 
conservative forces have recently continued to wage an 
undisguised war frenzy against our Republic. 
  According to a Voice of America report on 20 June, two U.S. 
senators, including Senator McCain, gave a news conference after 
their junket to South Korea, and advocated imposing tough 
sanctions against us and reinforcing U.S. forces in South Korea. 
They even made provocative, violent remarks, in an undisguised 
way, insisting that the United States launch a selective 
military strike against us. 
  Prior to this, in a television interview, Representative 
Hamilton, chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
remarked that there is a limit to U.S. patience. He said 
emphatically: It is necessary to complete the (?threat) 
potential of the ROK and U.S. Armed Forces and to make the 
intensification of sanctions a way to solve the issue on a 
priority basis. 
  In recent days, a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department 
has found fault with us by saying that our measure of 
withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency is 
making the situation more dangerous. He made an undisguised 
remark to rapidly reinforce U.S. Armed Forces in South Korea and 
additionally deploy U.S. military airplanes and an aircraft 
carrier to the area near the Korean peninsula. 
  THE WASHINGTON TIMES, a U.S. newspaper, has reported that 
the 
U.S. Defense Department has recently made an in-depth 
examination of ways to conduct a rapid dispatch of U.S. troops 
and U.S. fighter planes and a further dispatch of artillery 
detection radar, while additionally dispatching military 
intelligence experts to South Korea. 
  According to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, a U.S. newspaper, U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton has made it public that 
the United States is further reinforcing U.S. forces in South 
Korea with modern weapons and combat equipment.

<F P=106> ["Acts of Aggravating Northeast Asian Situation" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
comments on the tightened tieup between Japan and the United 
States. 
  Recalling that U.S. Forces are planning to stage a joint 
commanding exercise with the "Self-Defence" Airforce of Japan at 
the airforce base in Florida, the analyst says: All the 
military moves are grave acts of carrying the situation of the 
Northeast Asian region including the Korean peninsula to the 
extreme pitch of strain. 
  The analyst notes: 
  It must not go unnoticed that the military collusion between 
Japan and the United States is being tightened when the United 
States and its followers are intensifying as never before their 
hostile moves to stifle the DPRK over its "nuclear issue". 
  The United States is advertising that the survey and 
selection of the bases of the Japanese "Self-Defence Forces" 
were "merely selection of shelters." But, in actuality, it is 
related to the preparations for a new war in Korea. 
  As everyone knows, the United States is massing its forces 
around the Korean peninsula, and Japan is frequently staging 
joint military exercises with the United States. These are very 
dangerous acts driving the situation in the Northeast Asian 
region to the brink of war. 
  The Korean people and other Northeast Asian peoples will not 
remain an onlooker to the acts of the United States and Japan 
aggravating the situation in this region. 
  The U.S. and Japanese authorities must renounce their 
military collusion and wild ambition for domination of Asia, as 
demanded by the Asian people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Ill-Boding Military </F>
Movements"] 
  [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula has been 
further aggravated due to the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets to crush [apsal] the Republic. At 
such a time, very ill-boding [simsangchi annun] military 
activities have taken place at U.S. military bases in Yokosuka, 
Iwakuni, Sasebo, Okinawa, and other places in Japan. 
  U.S. warships have frequently entered and left the Yokosuka 
base, the sortie base of the 7th U.S. Fleet. The large 
destroyer (Pipe) sailed into port, and the fleet's flagship, 
Blue Ridge, followed suit on the morning of 17 June. The 
missile cruiser Mobile Bay and four other U.S. warships are now 
anchored at this base. The aircraft carrier Independence, which 
participated in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, will 
reportedly return there. 
  A U.S. Marine ammunition transport ship recently harbored at 
this base and for two days unloaded a large amount of ammunition 
for the (Urago) ammunition repository. 
  In the meantime, U.S. military planes from the Iwakuni base, 
a U.S. Marine air base, busily conducted an exercise; and more 
and more nuclear-powered submarines, ammunition transport ships, 
and refueling ships entered the Sasebo base. 
  Also, U.S. Marines frantically conducted a special 
operations 
exercise at bases on Okinawa. They reportedly conducted this 
exercise while simulating the imposition of sanctions on our 
country, the use of armed forces against our country, and the 
turning of Okinawa into a battlefield. 
  These busy movements at the U.S. bases in Japan are 
phenomena 
that can only be seen on the eve of a war and clearly show how 
frantically the U.S. imperialists are running amok to provoke a 
second Korean war. 
  The U.S. imperialists are running amok while talking about 
sanctions or use of military force under the pretext of the 
so-called nuclear issue. It has been clearly revealed, however, 
that the nuclear issue is a byproduct of their anti-Republic and 
antisocialist maneuvers and a falsehood that they fabricated to 
crush [apsal] our Republic. 
  The Japanese prime minister recently stated in a speech that 
he thought North Korea [pukchoson] did not have a nuclear weapon 
and had no intention of making one. In this way, he admitted 
that the nuclear commotions so far were groundless. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists placed the U.S. Forces 
in 
South Korea and the puppet forces on combat alert and are 
kicking up war commotions in U.S. bases in Japan at an 
unprecedented scale under the pretext of the nuclear issue. 
What is the reason? 
  This is related to their attempt to use Japan, which has 
been 
turned into their aggressive military base, to carry out a war 
of northward invasion in case they provoke such a war. In other 
words, they attempt to use Japan as a base for operations, 
supplies, and repairs in waging a Korean war. We can also say 
this is related to the fact that the U.S. imperialists secretly 
inspected bases of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and 
bases of the Air Self-Defense Force in Chitose, Misawa, and 
Matsushima. 
  A Japanese newspaper disclosed that this is intended to 
(?occupy) rear-area bases in an emergency on the Korean 
peninsula. This disclosure is not accidental. It is a 
well-known fact that during the Korean war, the U.S. 
imperialists used Japan as their sortie base and supply and 
repair base. 
  The U.S. imperialists even now attempt to invade the 
northern 
half of the Republic and realize their policy toward Korea and 
Asia by using Japan, geographically close to the Korean 
peninsula. However, this is a foolish dream. 
  Japan is not far from the Korean peninsula. If the situation 
is aggravated on the Korean peninsula and if, as a result, a war 
breaks out there, Japan, which has turned into a U.S. military 
base, will never be safe. 
  We do not want war. However, we are not afraid of it. 
  We will in no way forgive those who attempt to provoke 
[konduriryonun] the socialist system, which is our life, and 
deal a retaliatory blow 1,000-fold or 100-fold. 
  The Japanese people have expressed their indignation over 
the 
imperialists' maneuvers to envelope Japan in flames of war and 
are waging a vigorous antiwar struggle. 
  The U.S. imperialists must clearly see the people's 
aspirations and demands and act with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Bad Habit of Finding Fault With Others Must Be Discarded" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries are alleging that there is a possibility for the 
DPRK "to develop nuclear weapons in the future" and the South 
Korean puppets are blabbing that the North "will stockpile 200 
kg of plutonium every year" in the future and "export nuclear 
weapons", making a fuss over its "nuclear issue". 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: To 
call in question the past of the DPRK's nuclear activities is a 
deliberate move of those who dislike a smooth solution to the 
nuclear issue to complicate the situation. 
  For the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets 
to make much ado about the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK is a sinister act to lay an obstacle in the way of a smooth 
solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United 
States and deliberately aggravate the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. Lurking behind it is the intention to divert 
elsewhere the cautious eyes and criticism of the world directed 
to them, accelerate nuclear arms development by gaining time and 
justify their nuclear armament. 
  In actuality, the nuclear armament of Japan has reached the 
danger line. The South Korean puppets also have long since been 
stockpiling plutonium and stepping up the development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppets are 
raising a futile row over the DPRK's "nuclear issue", afraid 
that they shall lose the pretext for their nuclear armament, if 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is fundamentally 
solved through dialogue. 
  They must renounce the bad habit of finding fault with 
others, give up the nuclear design and stop the futile act of 
putting a spoke in the wheel of a fundamental solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] A Pyongyang report meeting to mark the 21st 
anniversary of the publication of "Let Us Prevent a National 
Partition and Reunify the Country," a historic work of Comrade 
Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people, was 
held in the People's Hall of Culture on the afternoon of 22 June. 
  Portraits of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and of 
dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il were respectfully placed in the 
front of the hall. 
  Slogans reading "Long live the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song!" and "Long live the glorious Workers Party of Korea 
[WPK]!" were hung in the hall. 
  The meeting was attended by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of 
the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice 
president; Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, alternate member of the 
Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chairman of 
the Supreme People's Assembly [SPA]; Chang Chol, vice premier of 
the Administration Council and minister of culture and art; Yu 
Mi-yong, chairman of the Central Committee of Chondoist Chongu 
Party; Kang Hyon-su, responsible secretary of Pyongyang 
municipal party and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's 
Committee; Yom Tae-chun, chairman of the Central Committee of 
the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland 
[DFRF]; responsible functionaries from public organizations and 
personages concerned; functionaries from central organizations 
and workers from all walks of life in the city. 
  The meeting began with the playing of the national anthem. 
  Paek Nam-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Committee 
for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], made a 
commemorative speech. 
  [Begin Paek recording] Comrades, today our people across the 
country are fully demonstrating chuche Korea's dignity and grand 
appearance by resolutely smashing antisocialist and 
anti-Republic maneuvers of the imperialists and international 
reactionaries with singlehearted unity with the party and the 
leader [suryong]. The ardent wish to achieve the reunification 
in the nineties with great national unity has been increasing 
with each passing day among fellow countrymen at home and 
abroad. Under this heartwarming circumstance, we are 
significantly marking the 21st anniversary of the publication of 
"Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country", 
an immortal work of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  On this historic occasion, our people are recalling with 
deep 
emotion justness and invincible vitality of the five-point 
policies for national reunification put forward by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and lodestar 
of national reunification. We are filled with a firm resolution 
to break through difficulties laid in the way of reunification 
with the strength of national unity and to achieve the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland by all 
means. 
  The great leader's immortal work, "Let Us Prevent a National 
Partition and Reunify the Country", was published at a very 
grave time when confrontation between the lines of reunification 
and division was aggravated to an extreme pitch in our country 
owing to two Koreas policy of separatist forces at home and 
abroad and when the new danger of a permanent division was being 
created before the nation. 
  As everyone knows, a dialogue between the North and the 
South 
was provided for the first time according to the policy for 
broad-range North-South negotiation elucidated by the great 
leader in his speech on 6 August 1971, and the 4 July joint 
statement, which assumed the principles of independence, peace 
and great national unity as its basic content, was published. 
Since that time, the spirit for national reunification has 
rapidly been enhanced among the South Korean people, together 
with all the Korean people, and the anticommunist confrontation 
line has begun to be shaken to its roots in South Korea. 
  Embarrassed by this, the South Korean ruling bunch openly 
infringed upon the three principles for national reunification, 
which it pledged before the nation, at the instigation of 
outside forces, and fabricated the fascist Yusin system. In 
addition, the South Korean ruling bunch intensified North-South 
confrontation and advanced along the road of betrayal to pursue 
permanent division. Finally, on 23 June 1973, the South Korean 
ruling bunch went so far as to publish a special statement 
announcing the creation of two Koreas as its policy. 
  The situation that prevailed at that time urgently demanded 
that active measures be worked out to prevent the danger of 
permanent division impending before the nation and to open the 
path for national reunification. 
  On 23 June 1973, immediately after the South Korean ruling 
bunch published a special statement, the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song put forth the five-point policy of national 
reunification as a revolutionary measure decisively to smash the 
permanent nation-splitting moves of the U.S. imperialists and 
their stooges and open an epochal phase of national 
reunification. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our 
proposal is to remove military confrontation and ease tension 
between the North and the South, bring about multilateral 
collaboration and interchange between the two parts, convene the 
great national congress composed of representatives of people of 
all levels and political parties and social organizations in the 
North and the South, institute the North-South confederation 
under the single name of the Confederal Republic of Koryo and 
enter the United Nations under that name. When this proposal 
for the country's reunification is put into effect, a great 
turning point will be brought about in accomplishing the 
historic cause of peaceful national reunification based on the 
principle of the North-South joint statement, as commonly 
desired by our people and the world's people. 
  The five-point policy of national reunification laid down by 
the great leader was a patriotic reunification formula most 
correctly reflecting the unanimous aspirations and will of all 
the fellow countrymen who desired a peaceful reunification of 
the country and opposed a permanent division of the nation, and 
an immortal militant banner which set forth a broad vista and 
the way of national reunification and vigorously inspired all 
the people to the struggle to realize it. [applause] 
  The policy for removing military confrontation and easing 
tension set forth by the great leader in his five-point policy 
for national reunification is a just policy which gave a clear 
answer to the most urgent and important question for removing 
misunderstanding and distrust between the North and the South, 
for achieving national reconciliation, and for achieving the 
nation's peaceful reunification. The proposal for realizing 
multilateral collaboration and interchange between the North and 
the South is a most reasonable plan enabling us to promote the 
unified development of the nation by linking severed ties of the 
nation. 
  The proposal for convening the great national congress 
composed of representatives of people of all levels and 
political parties and social organizations between the North and 
the South, which the great leader put forward in his five-point 
policy for national reunification, is a chuche-oriented 
reunification policy which enables us to resolve the issue of 
national reunification in compliance with the will and demand of 
the nation through the nation's own strength by making the 
people from all walks of life in the North and the South broadly 
participate in accomplishing the cause of national reunification. 
  In particular, the proposal for instituting the North-South 
confederation under the single name set forth by the great 
leader is a unique method for achieving national reunification 
most promptly and most reasonably without giving any 
disadvantage to either the North or the South under the 
condition in which different ideas and systems exist in the 
North and the South of our country. This proposal clearly 
reflects the consistent patriotic position of our party and the 
government of the Republic to achieve national reunification at 
an early date by ending confrontation between fellow countrymen 
and the division at any cost, based on the national unity 
between the North and the South. 
  The five-point policy for national reunification put forward 
by the great leader is a most reasonable and realistic 
reunification policy that can be accepted by all the people who 
love the nation, and by the people who want national 
reunification, because of its thoroughgoing patriotic position, 
justness, and fairness that are reflected in all articles and 
clauses. 
  The three principles of national reunification--the great 
common reunification program of the nation--are comprehensively 
embodied in the five-point policy of national reunification. The 
basic spirit contained in these principles is the firm 
reunification will and patriotic ideal to achieve the 
reunification into one Korea by opposing division. 
  The five-point policy of national reunification also 
contains 
concrete measures and methods for expediting the independent and 
peaceful reunification of the fatherland by preventing the 
nation's permanent division. The five-point policy is a 
declaration of one Korea that opened a bright future for 
resolving the reunification issue by giving a hard blow to the 
two-Koreas moves of the splittists at home and abroad, and is a 
great programmatic guideline of national reunification that 
intensively reflected the aspiration of the entire nation to 
reunification. 
  Indeed, the five-point policy for national reunification 
is an immortal reunification program which can be put forward 
only by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, 
the peerless patriot, the sun of the nation, and the lodestar of 
national reunification, who has devoted his whole life to 
achieving the country's independence and the nation's grandeur 
and prosperity since he embarked on the road of revolution, 
taking upon himself the destiny of the country and the nation, 
and who is leading all of the people to the single road of 
national reunification, while feeling grieved over the nation's 
division more than anyone else. [applause] 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and 
people, who has been carrying out great exploits for the cause 
of our revolution and the cause of national reunification, has 
wisely led the struggle to realize the five-point policy for 
national reunification put forward by the great leader. The 
dear comrade leader has not only vigorously pushed ahead with 
the work to explain and propagate the five-point policy for 
national reunification at home and abroad, but has also taken 
various epochal measures to realize this new peaceful 
reunification policy. 
  The 59th expanded meeting of the Central Committee of the 
Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, 
convened in accordance with the dear comrade leader's plan 
discussed the matter on convening a great national conference to 
be participated in by representatives of political parties and 
social organizations and representatives of all strata in the 
North, the South, and overseas and proposed, in the name of the 
political parties and social organization in the North, to the 
people of all strata, political parties, and social 
organizations in South Korea the convocation of a great national 
conference to consult and solve the question of national 
reunification, the utmost desire of the nation. 
  Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader our 
party and the Government of the Republic vigorously struggled to 
thoroughly implement the five-point policy for national 
reunification and to open a new phase of national reunification 
with the independent strength of the nation. Thanks to the dear 
comrade leader's wise leadership in the struggle to implement 
the five-point policy for national reunification it was possible 
to impose big blows on the maneuvers for a permament division of 
the nation by splittists at home and abroad and to vigorously 
encourage and inspire the compatriots at home and abroad into 
the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification. 
  At this significant meeting which marks the 21st anniversary 
of the publication of the great leader's historic speech, "Let 
us prevent national division and reunify the country," I 
respectfully extend utmost honor and warmest gratitude, along 
with the infinite reverence and burning loyalty of all of the 
Korean people, to the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of national 
reunification, who is brilliantly elucidating the road ahead for 
national reunification with the rays of chuche, leading our 
people to the single road of victory and glory. [applause] [end 
recording] 
  The reporter said that the past 20-odd years from the time 
when the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song declared the 
five-point policy for national reunification up to now were the 
20-odd years of serious confrontation between the reunification 
forces and the splittist forces and the days of struggle during 
which the whole nation vigorously fought to repel the 
splittists' challenges and to achieve the cause of national 
reunification and revealed the criminal maneuvers of the U.S. 
imperialists, the South Korean puppets, and the Japanese 
reactionaries to block our national reunification. 
  The reporter then said that the imperialist reactionaries 
who 
have forced the untold sufferings of division and misfortune 
upon our nation for a long time and are perpetrating the 
maneuvers to crush [apsal] the Republic under the pretext of our 
nonexistent nuclear issue, and the flunkeyist nation-sellers in 
South Korea who have followed the imperialist reactionaries, 
will not be able to escape the condemnation of all of the Korean 
people and continued: 
  [Begin recording] Comrades: It is not allowable for our 
nation, who has been forced to endure the sufferings of division 
caused by outside forces for nearly half a century, to live in 
uneasiness, failing to achieve unity and reunification until 
today, exposed to the danger of an unpredictable nuclear war on 
top of the tragedy of national division. We should put an end to 
the division of the nation with the nation's united strength and 
achieve the country's reunification. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Reunifying 
the country by ending the history of division and confrontation 
for nearly half a century is the unanimous demand and will of 
the entire nation. To achieve the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country it is imperative to achieve the 
great unity of the entire nation. 
  Today, all of the Korean people in the North, the South, and 
overseas are faced with the heavy but honorable task of 
expediting the cause of the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country with united the strength of the 
entire nation, by thoroughly implementing the 10-point program 
of the great unity of the whole nation for national 
reunification laid down by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation 
for national reunification laid down by the great leader is a 
most reasonable and realistic political program for national 
unity and a great charter of national reunification which can be 
acceptable to anyone who loves the country and the nation and 
who desire national reunification. [applause] 
  Our nation's only way out under today's stern situation 
[chosondoen chunomhan chongsehaeso] is all fellow countrymen's 
strongly uniting under the uplifted banner of the 10-point 
program of the whole nation for national reunification. The 
people from all walks of life in South Korea and overseas 
compatriots must consider the 10-point program of the whole 
nation for national reunification to be the nation's common 
guideline and firm will and continuously and vigorously wage the 
struggle to implement this program. 
  In compliance with the aspirations of the time and the 
demand 
of the people of the DPRK and the United States, the United 
States must no longer seek sanctions against us but come out, 
with a sincere attitude and position, to the DPRK-U.S. talks, 
which can peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Strong-arm measures or sanctions can in no way be a way to 
resolve the nuclear issue but will only bring a catastrophic 
situation [kanggwonina chejenun kyolko haengmunje haegyorui 
pangdoro toelsu opsumyo kugossun ojik pagukchogin satae manul 
chorae halppunimnida]. 
  Even though our people hope for a fair solution to the 
nuclear problem and value peace and security in the country, 
they will not beg for this even at the expense of national 
dignity and independence. 
  We believe the visit to Pyongyang by a former U.S. President 
a few days ago will produce an affirmative result. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the hostile policy 
toward the Republic, a policy that they have pursued motivated 
by a foolish intention to realize their old dream of the greater 
East Asia prosperity sphere. 
  The Japanese authorities must ponder over consequences from 
their maneuvers against the Republic and the General Association 
of Korean Residents in Japan, honestly apologize for all the 
crimes committed so far, and punish the criminals. 
  Sanctions against us are immediately sanctions against the 
South and a declaration of war to the 70 million Koreans [urie 
taehan chejenun kot namedaehan chejeimyo chilchonman kyore-e 
taehan sonjon pogo imnida]. 
  The South Korean authorities must renounce the policy of 
depending on outside force, take the stand of national 
independence, give up the policy of confrontation between the 
fellow countrymen, and seek national reconciliation and unity. 
  It is our consistent position to meet with anyone--who truly 
wants the independent, peaceful reunification of the country 
from the stand of great national unity and national 
independence--and jointly seek the way of peace in the country 
and its peaceful reunification. 
  The premier of the DPRK Administration Council, thinking it 
lucky that the South Korean side expressed its position to hold 
top-level talks with us, sent a message today upon authorization 
to the South Korean prime minister, a message that welcomes and 
agrees to the South side's proposal for holding a preliminary 
contact for the North-South top-level talks. 
  I express support to it in the name of the participants in 
this report meeting, considering that it reflects our side's 
consistent position and policy to bring an end to North-South 
confrontation and open a new phase for national reunification 
independently and peacefully through top-level talks. [applause] 
  The year 1995 is a meaningful year that marks the 50th 
anniversary of the fatherland's liberation and a historic year 
designated to be the starting year of our nation's 
reunification. We must make positive efforts to adorn 1995 as 
the year of national reunification at all costs. 
  After strongly uniting, under the banner of the 10-point 
program of the great unity of the whole nation, all the 
compatriots at home and abroad must vigorously struggle to 
achieve reunification based on the most reasonable confederal 
system involving one nation and one state, two systems and two 
governments. 
  The dear leader of our party and people Comrade Kim Chong-il 
is the symbol of socialism, our life and existence, and the 
destiny of the fatherland and the nation [uriui saengmyongigo 
saenghwarin, sahoejuuiui sangjing imyo chogukkwa minjogui 
unmyong isimnida]. 
  All people in the northern half of the Republic must defend 
and glorify our-style socialism and hasten reunification, in the 
nineties, by cherishing deep in their hearts the belief of sure 
victory, that they always win only if there is the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, and continuously and highly displaying 
their enthusiasm and loyalty, which were more highly 
demonstrated on the 30th anniversary of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il's start of work at the party Central Committee. 
  All the workers must score great upsurges in all fronts of 
socialist economic construction in hearty response to our 
party's revolutionary economic strategies. 
  No force in the world will be able to block the path of our 
people who, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, are 
vigorously marching forward under the wise leadership of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause] 
  Let us all vigorously struggle to hasten the complete 
victory 
of socialism and the fatherland's independent, peaceful 
reunification, after strongly uniting around the party and the 
leader [suryong]. [applause] [end recording] 
  The report meeting ended with the chorus of the song "Korea 
Is One."

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- A seminar on "1. The 
Origin of the Chuche Idea" from "On the Chuche Idea", a famous 
work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, was held by the 
group for the study of the idea and theory of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in Lebanon. 
  Saying that the chuche idea raised man's position and role 
in 
the world as the fundamental question of philosophy and 
elucidated the philosophical principle that man is the master of 
everything and decides everything, the reporter noted: "The 
Korean people have built a powerful socialist country of 
independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in defence on 
the land of Korea on the basis of the chuche idea." 
  A seminar on the work "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses

the party and the masses form a harmonious whole, speakers said: 
"The imperialists are trying to destroy the socialism of Korea, 
but it is a foolish dream."

<F P=106> ["Clairvoyance in Building Socialism With Bright Future" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- With Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, an outstanding leader with clairvoyance at the head of 
the party and the revolution, our people are always full of 
confidence in sure victory and optimism and the prospect of 
our-style socialism is always bright, declares NODONG SINMUN 
today. 
  In a by-lined article titled "Clairvoyance in Building 
Socialism With Bright Future" the paper says the history of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is shining as 
glorious annals of an outstanding leader who has guided the 
cause of socialism along the most correct way with clairvoyance 
to successfully build socialism. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said: 
  "Since Comrade Kim Chong-il began his leadership, fresh 
changes have taken place not only in the party work but also in 
different domains of politics, economy and culture and great 
innovations and upsurge have been effected in all sectors of 
socialist construction." 
  The clairvoyance of Comrade Kim Chong-il in triumphantly 
leading the cause of socialism has been demonstrated in 
constantly developing in depth socialism on a new ideological 
and theoretical basis with deep insight into the demand of the 
time. 
  He comprehensively systematized the fundamental principle 
and 
contents of the chuche idea with energetic thinking and pursuit. 
He proved in a scientific way that only the chuche idea, the 
revolutionary idea centred on the popular masses which gives the 
man-centred outlook on the world, is the guiding idea which 
makes it possible to solve most correctly all the problems 
arising in the accomplishment of the socialist cause. Then, he 
proclaimed the chuche idea as the guiding idea and theory of our 
age by formulating the revolutionary idea of the respected 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song as the system of the idea, theory and 
method of chuche. 
  His clairvoyance has been displayed also in that he has 
wisely guided the efforts to strengthen the party and enhance 
its leadership function and role, in compliance with the 
prospective demand of socialist and communist construction, 
grasping this as the main point, and has always kept to our way, 
the way of chuche in socialist construction. 
  He gave a comprehensive exposition of original policies 
envisaging that the party's leadership must be continued in the 
communist society. And he has strengthened and developed our 
party to be a tested guide of the cause of socialism and 
communism and constantly enhanced its role with energetic 
guidance. 
  He set forth the revolutionary slogan "Let us live our own 
way!" With the chuche-based will and faith that the Korean 
revolutionaries must build socialism and communism on the land 
of Korea and build an ideal society of the people with our own 
efforts in conformity with our people's aspiration and will. 
And he has wisely led the revolution and construction so that 
they could be carried on in the Korean way, the way of chuche. 
  It is a splendid fruition of the wise guidance of the dear 
leader with clairvoyance that an invincible socialism is 
confidently advancing along its own way without the slightest 
vacillation under any circumstances has been built in our 
country, stresses the article.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Former war 
correspondent of the Korean People's Army Yi In-mo, the 
incarnation of faith and will, visited the exhibition of the 
three revolutions in Pyongyang. 
  Being briefed on the brilliant achievements made by the 
Korean people in carrying on the three revolutions, ideological, 
technical and cultural, under the wise leadership of the party 
and the leader, he saw with deep emotion exhibits at the general 
hall, the heavy industry hall, the light industry hall and other 
halls. 
  After his visit, he said that the Korean people have brought 
a great change in socialist economic construction under the 
party's unique banner of the three revolutions. The exhibition 
well shows the economic development of the country which is 
demonstrating its might to the whole world, he noted. 
  "Our country", he stressed, "could build a solid independent 
national economy with a powerful chuche-based industry and 
developed agriculture because it was under the tested guidance 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il". 
  At the end of his visit to the West Sea Barrage, he wrote in 
the visitor's book: 
  "This barrage fully shows the matchless grit of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and the looks of the Korean people 
united around him in one mind. 
  Yi In-mo toured the revolutionary site on Munsu Hill and the 
Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang.

  [Text] Today, a great heyday has unfolded in our country, 
unprecedented in the 5,000-year long history. 
  Our fatherland has turned into a socialist power with 
invincible national strength because the revolutionary party has 
been strengthened and developed, and world-class changes have 
been achieved in all sectors--political, economic, cultural, and 
military--under the party's leadership. 
  In June 1964, our people came to usher in the new era of 
this 
proud history because they were blessed again with having 
another leader [suryong] by upholding the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il at the head of the party and the revolution. 
  Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, the 
party's leadership role has been extraordinarily consolidated, 
and the party work has been carried out in close tandem with the 
economic work over the past 30 years. As a result, in 
accordance with pushing for the economic construction and 
national defense building, we have seen the successful 
accomplishments of the Seven-Year Plan, which had been carried 
out until 1970; of the Six-Year Plan from 1971 to 1976; of the 
Second Seven-Year Plan from 1978 to 1984; and of the Third 
Seven-Year Plan from 1987 to 1993. 
  The implementation of the four grand long-range plans has 
unfolded the heyday of our era which is shining with the 
esteemed name of Comrade Kim Chong-il, and has displayed to the 
whole world the formidable might and invincibility of the 
socialist fatherland in which the leader [suryong], the party, 
and the masses are marching forward in singlehearted unity. 
  Our self-supporting national economy has endlessly been 
strengthened and developed on the basis of its own firm 
foundation. The industrial production had increased by more than 
one and a half times in each period of the plan. 
  The industrial production increased by 3.3 times during the 
Seven-Year Plan period; by 2.2 times during the Six-Year Plan 
period as of the end of August 1975 when we achieved the goal 
ahead of schedule by one year and four months; by 2.2 times 
during the Second Seven-Year Plan period; and by 1.5 times 
during the Third Seven-Year Plan period. 
  These great achievements, which have been made for the past 
30 years, are precious fruitions of the leadership of the 
revolution and construction by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il--a great politician, a genius of creation and 
construction, and an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant 
commander--who has with far-sighted clear-mindedness, 
outstanding revolutionary sweep, matchless mettle, and 
extraordinary determination. Herein lie the immortal 
achievements of the outstanding leader [yongdoja] who has added 
bright luster to Korea in the whole world. 
  The 30 year-long period until today since the dear comrade 
leader began leading the party work has been one in which the 
most glorious and brilliant era has unfolded in the annals of 
the Korean revolution, and one of great creations and changes in 
which Korea unprecedentedly shines in the whole world throughout 
the 5,000-year old history of our nation. 
  Our people will brilliantly accomplish the revolutionary 
cause of chuche along the single road to loyalty forever by 
cherishing deep in their hearts the greatest national dignity 
and pride of having established a socialist power in which they 
neither fear nor envy anything in the world, while upholding the 
great leader [widaehan yongdoja] at the head of the party and 
the revolution and following his seasoned leadership.

  [Text] Filipino farmers are asking the Philippine Senate 
not to ratify the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or 
GATT, which government representatives signed in Marrakech, 
Morocco recently. The farmers said the agreement would deepen 
rural poverty, hunger, and joblessness. The farmers spoke 
during a hearing yesterday at the Senate on GATT. 
  Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, chairperson of the 
committees on trade and commerce, said her committees will hold 
judgment on GATT until all sectors are heard. She said the 
Senate set October as the deadline for acting on GATT to enable 
the Philippines to catch up with the implementation of the 
accord.

  [Text] The U.S. Government has demanded that the Japanese 
Government set up a Investment-Promotion Agency [IPA] designed 
to facilitate foreign firms' direct investment in Japan. It has 
asked Japan to set up an agency which specializes in carrying 
out intermediary work on foreign investment in Japan and in 
providing foreign companies with information on loans by the 
Japan Development Bank [JDB] and other banks. It has also 
demanded that Japan promote the deregulation of investment with 
a new agency playing a leading role. 
  The establishment of the new government agency is one of the 
U.S. demands in connection with the Japanese-U.S. economic 
framework talks. The U.S. Government has maintained that in 
order to increase direct investment in Japan, the Japanese 
Government needs to find foreign firms which are enthusiastic 
about doing business in Japan, as well as to provide information 
on JDB loans and favorable treatment in terms of taxation. It 
has demanded that the Japanese Government set up a general 
agency designed to provide such services and to formulate new 
programs for promoting investment. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government has rejected the U.S. 
demand, saying: "The establishment of the new government agency 
runs counter to the current move to promote administrative 
reform." It has claimed that the United States should set up a 
contact office for promoting investment in Japan.

  [Excerpt] Thai finance officials have been instructed to 
put the U.S. dollar on the priority watch list after falling 
against the yen over the past two days, hitting at one time the 
post-World War 11 record low of Y99.85 on the New York market. 
  Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said, "The U.S. dollar 
has just started to slip; we need to monitor it further." 
  He added, "If this is only a short-run development, there 
won't be much impact. But if it is a long-run problem, there 
might be a lot of ramifications. I have urged officials to 
closely monitor the development." 
  Currency analysts said the fall of the U.S. dollar is not a 
surprise, but the depths it has reached are indeed low, because 
the U.S. and Japan have failed to settle their trade disputes. 
  They said the jitters over the U.S.-Japan trade talks has 
been accentuated by repatriation of the yen by Japanese 
corporations, who are selling the dollar for yen on the belief 
that the economy back home is recovering. 
  "If U.S. dollar is weakened over a long period of time, 
there 
will be significant impact on the baht. But there is an 
advantage: a large chunk of foreign debt is dominated in U.S. 
dollars, we might seek to refinance such loans," a ministry 
source said. 
  "In our own fiscal position, we are ready for that. It is 
also the policy of Finance Minister Tharin who wants to seek 
early repayment of existing loans," the source said. 
  The baht also appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar, 
to 
the highest level in four months. The mid rate was fixed at 
Bt25.05 per dollar, while the Exchange Equalization Fund bought 
the dollar at lows of Bt24.95. 
  The ministry source added that there had been high 
volatility 
in the U.S. financial market. "The U.S. authorities might not 
want the dollar to be too high. And it is expected that the 
Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates too high," the 
source said. Higher interest rates would make the dollar more 
attractive on international markets. 
  "The Fed might not want to raise interest rates further 
because the U.S. economy has just recovered; and world economic 
growth has been at just 2.5 per cent," the source said. 
  The benefits of early repayment of dollar denominated loans 
is not expected to be significant, as Thailand loans are 
equivalent to only five per cent of its exports, the source said. 
  As there is more volatility in the foreign exchange market, 
the swap premium has risen by three per cent to nine per cent, 
according to a trader at Standard Chartered Bank. 
  Importers are to pay higher forward rate. The forward rate 
for one month ahead is BtO.10 a dollar, for two months it is 
BtO.26 and for three months BtO.41. 
  Exporters get a premium of BtO.09-BtO.10 a dollar for one 
month, BtO.24-BtO.26 for three months and BtO.42-BtO.44 for six 
months, the trader said. 
  The recent weakening of the U.S. dollar has not created any 
sense of panic in the local market. Most participants are 
watching the markets in London and New York to see if the 
monetary authorities will step in and intervene. [passage

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa has canceled a planned visit to the United States this 
weekend for bilateral "framework" trade talks with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official said Thursday [23 June]. 
  The cancellation was decided because the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion 
earlier in the day to the House of Representatives against the 
cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the official said. 
  If the lower house approves the motion, Hata must either 
resign with his entire cabinet or dissolve the house for a 
general election. 
  "Under the circumstances, it is not appropriate for the 
foreign minister, who is a member of the cabinet, to go to the 
U.S. and negotiate," the official said. 
  Kantor said Tuesday he plans to discuss macroeconomic and 
sectoral issues when he meets Kakizawa. 
  On Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said 
Kakizawa's visit to the U.S. has yet to be fixed because of 
uncertainties in Japan's political community. 
  Kakizawa was to leave Japan on Friday and return to Tokyo on 
Monday. 
  Japan and U.S. officials have said they hope to reach an 
agreement in the talks on setting up a new bilateral trade 
framework before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrial nations in July. 
  Under the framework negotiations designed to rectify the 
chronic trade imbalance between the two countries, the U.S. is 
pressing Japan to set "objective criteria" to measure progress 
in market- opening. 
  But Tokyo rejects binding criteria, saying they could lead 
to 
managed trade.

<F P=106> ["Who Can Trust IAEA?" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The withdrawal of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is entirely attributable to the 
unfair and insolent acts of the IAEA Secretariat, declares 
NODONG SINMUN in an article today. It notes that the IAEA has 
left a disgraceful stain on its name by launching an anti-DPRK 
campaign, contrary to its competence and mission. 
  The article entitled "Indelible Stain and Disgrace" cites 
facts to prove that some officials of the IAEA Secretariat took 
a threatening posture from the very beginning in a bid to 
overwhelm the DPRK and stubbornly demanded an unreasonable 
"special inspection" and worked for an international "pressure 
and sanctions", serving specific forces as their spy. 
  It says: 
  The IAEA made six ad hoc inspections of the DPRK from May 
1992 to early February 1993. 
  At the time of the fourth ad hoc inspection in November 1992 
some officials of the IAEA Secretariat urged the DPRK to 
"declare more" of the inventory of nuclear material, threatening 
that "it is the last chance of correcting the initial 
inventory", "if the chance were missed, tragic consequences 
would follow." 
  They behaved very insolently during the inspections, 
threatening the DPRK over the "principal inconsistency" even 
before hearing a scientific explanation from experts. 
  All this tells that they have sought from the very beginning 
to overpower the DPRK with a threatening attitude. 
  Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat also served specific 
forces as their spy. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, complying with the demand of specific 
forces, tried to send as its inspectors those whom we considered 
as personae non gratae. The agency's inspectors in the DPRK 
also acted on orders from those behind the scene, making 
inquiries into this or that in an effort to pry out secrets. 
  All the more exasperating was that they handed inspection 
results over to the United States, South Korea and others in 
violation of Article 5 of the safeguards agreement that provides 
for protection of the data obtained in inspections. 
  This was a grave encroachment upon the interests of the 
DPRK. 
  IAEA's inspections of the DPRK are characterized from a to z 
by partiality. 
  On December 22, 1992, the IAEA general director requested 
being allowed to "revisit" some military sites. The DPRK was 
not obligated to show them the sites and facilities which were 
no more objects of safeguards, but showed them, taking various 
aspects into consideration. Nevertheless, some dishonest 
officials worked hard to attain their sinister aim by abusing 
the sincere cooperation offered by the DPRK. 
  The DPRK rejected it decisively. 
  On February 25, the IAEA general director convened a meeting 
of the IAEA Board of Governors, which adopted a "resolution on 
special inspection" of ordinary military sites of the DPRK. 
This was something unprecedented in the history of inspections 
by the agency. 
  And the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an unjustifiable 
"resolution" against the DPRK on June 10 when reactor core 
refueling was under way at the DPRK's five megawatt experimental 
atomic power plant. 
  The dishonest officials of the IAEA Secretariat took the 
DPRK's "nuclear issue" even to the United Nations in an effort 
to gratify their wicked aim by "internationalizing" it and 
imposing collective "pressure and sanctions" on the DPRK. 
  The IAEA Board of Governors last year adopted one 
"resolution" after another to transfer the DPRK's "nuclear 
issue" to the UN and submitted even "an annual report" to the UN 
General Assembly. They went the length of faking a "letter" of 
the UN secretary-general. 
  Who can trust the IAEA which is behaving like this? 
  We will never tolerate any act of infringing upon our 
national sovereignty and supreme interests of our country. 
  The IAEA must know clearly that whatever intrigue it may 
hatch up to stifle the DPRK, it will only bring a stain and 
disgrace to itself.

<F P=106> ["S. Korean Students Slam Campus Suppression" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- About 200 students of 
Chonnam National University of South Korea formed an Emergency 
Measure Committee to denounce the search of campuses and defend 
the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General 
Student Councils (Namchongnyon) on June 19 before launching an 
all-night sit-in strike, a radio report from Seoul said. 
  The students strongly denounced the puppet authorities for 
hurling police into their university, walking away students and 
perpetrating search and confiscation for the mere reason that 
students in this area went to Seoul to participate in a people's 
rally to check the "parliamentary endorsement of the Uruguay 
Round accord" and held protests. 
  The students pointed out that the puppet authorities' 
suppression is aimed at disuniting the Namchongnyon, and 
demanded an immediate release of their fellow students.

bellicose elements perpetrated military provocations again in 
the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), military sources said. 
  They illegally introduced recoilless guns into the southern

20 to 22. 
  They also brought by stealth large-caliber machine guns into 
the MP [military police] posts in the central sector of the

  On June 22, they brought 25 vehicles and 500 armed personnel 
into the southern portion of the DMZ to build military setups. 
  If the South Korean bellicose elements continue aggravating 
the tensions in the DMZ despite our repeated warnings, they will 
have to bear full responsibility for all consequences arising 
therefrom.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The EAEC: the Major Powers Have Failed To </F>
Fulfill Their Promises"] 
  [Text] Although human civilization is said to be reaching 
its climax, the colonial mentality remains entrenched in most 
Western nations, especially in the major powers. They try to 
impose their values and initiatives on small nations but 
strongly object to views from small countries or groups of small 
countries in the Third World. The United States is a major 
power that adopts such an attitude. 
  Washington's opposition to the proposal to establish the 
East 
Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] is proof of how a major power 
deprecates and tries to push aside any proposal from the Third 
World, in this case ASEAN. The United States has acted 
"elusively" by prevailing over Japan, another major power and 
economic giant. 
  In fact, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has already sensed 
the American reaction. For him, Malaysia is prepared to face 
the U.S. opposition. The prime minister said he had gotten 
information about Washington's stance, although it had been 
announced [as published] to the Japanese Government. Malaysia 
may ask Japan or China for cooperation. 
  Beijing's cooperation is important for the EAEC's success. 
China's interests were apparent in the U.S. action extending 
China's MFN [most favored nation] status for another year early 
this month despite human rights violations there. Washington is 
powerless to impose its wishes on China because it realizes that 
China has great economic power. The volume of trade between the 
two nations is estimated at RM [Malaysian ringgit] 100 billion. 
  Assuming the U.S. presidency January last year, Bill Clinton 
pledged to establish closer relations with Asia, which absorbs 
60 percent of Washington's total exports. A few months later, 
Clinton was however mired in various regional problems, mainly 
over the implementation of his campaign promise to fight for 
human rights and establish Western standards in a region which 
he fails to understand. In addition to facing problems over his 
policy toward China, Clinton also made a major error that hurt 
Malaysia. He convened the first summit of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation [APEC], which was made up of 15 members 
(now 17 members), including ASEAN, in Seattle by the end of last 
year without taking into account the views of other member 
nations. The prime minister, who foresaw that APEC would be 
monopolized by major powers, was reluctant to attend it. 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating tried to exploit the 
matter by describing Dr. Mahathir as a "recalcitrant." 
  Clinton, who realized his error during the APEC summit, 
later 
adopted a wait-and-see policy toward the Malaysian-mooted EAEC 
idea. However, the United States is undertaking a campaign to 
persuade APEC members not to support the EAEC idea while 
adopting the wait-and-see policy. Besides the United States, 
Australia is also trying hard to foil the establishment of the 
EAEC. During a press conference in Manila last Monday, Foreign 
Minister Gareth Evans openly said that the EAEC may undermine 
cooperation among nations in the region. He warned that any 
regional trade group which excludes the United States will only 
pose a great danger. 
  Evans claimed that the EAEC would not pose a threat if it 
became just a consultative forum within APEC. Once again, a 
major power has tried to prove that the idea of a group of 
developing nations was unacceptable to developed nations. We 
are not surprised over Evans' remarks or the latest U.S. 
opposition to the EAEC. The two nations have adopted a 
deprecatory attitude toward the idea; however, in the beginning 
they did not openly show their opposition. 
  The United States is now claiming that it is trying to 
understand the problems of Asian nations. U.S. officials 
admitted that Washington's policy toward Asia faced problems 
last year but said that its relations with the region had 
returned to a correct path. However, we feel that the United 
States and its allies have failed to fulfill their promises. 
Their opposition to the EAEC shows their distrust of Asian 
nations. Their opposition also shows their power and is not in 
the interests of the world community.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Malaysian envoy to 
Tokyo criticized Japan on Thursday [23 June] for remaining 
noncommittal on the planned East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), 
saying Japan's position depends on that of the United States. 
  In a speech at a Tokyo hotel, Malaysian Ambassador to Japan 
H. M. Khatib said Japan has not yet made a decision on whether 
to join the EAEC because it is "very concerned" about the U.S. 
position on the caucus. 
  Japan initially said it was waiting for a consensus on the 
plan by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), but 
is still undecided even after a consensus was reached, he said. 
  "All it has said so far is that it is still studying the 
proposal and is waiting for more details about operational 
aspects of the EAEC," Khatib said in the speech sponsored by the 
Asian Affairs Research Council. 
  "It seems clear to us that Japan's position on the EAEC is 
dependent on the U.S. position," he said. "As long as the 
United States remains opposed to the EAEC, Japan has excuses not 
to be part of this caucus." 
  He said it would be a "pity" if Japan, which could play an 
important part in the EAEC, would cause the EAEC project to 
stall, pointing out that Japan's absence from the caucus would 
make China and South Korea reluctant to participate. 
  But he said ASEAN would wait for Japan to make a decision 
because Japan is important for the caucus. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed proposed the 
establishment of the EAEC in 1990. The potential members 
include Japan, South Korea and emerging Southeast Asian nations. 
  Khatib said the EAEC aims at promoting an open and free 
trade 
system and is not meant to be a closed, inward-looking trade 
bloc. It is also compatible and unconfrontational with the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he said. 
  The envoy said ASEAN believes the U.S. would approve of the 
EAEC once it has a better understanding of the idea, so that 
ASEAN will continue to be "transparent" with the U.S. about it. 
  But if the U.S. still cannot "rid itself of its own 
difficulties" despite the transparency, ASEAN hopes the U.S. 
will not take any "measures destructive of this positive effort 
to further enhance growth of East Asian economies which will 
also benefit the U.S. in turn," he said. 
  "It really is unwise for anyone to kill the goose that could 
lay enough golden eggs for all," he said. 
  Mahathir, who boycotted the U.S. invitation to an informal 
APEC summit in Seattle last November, will attend another summit 
in Indonesia this fall, he said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 23 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Primary Industries Minister Dr. Lim Keng Yaik left for a six-day 
visit to Myanmar [Burma] Thursday at the head of an official 
delegation to enhance bilateral trade relations between the two 
countries. 
  Priority areas for discussions during the visit would be 
palm 
oil, forestry, timber and minerals, he said in a statement 
issued here. 
  While there, he would be calling on the trade minister, 
finance and revenue minister, forestry minister, agriculture 
minister and minister for mines as well as meet public and 
private sector organisations. 
  Dr. Lim said he would also take the opportunity to seek 
business and investment ventures in other areas that could be 
explored by the private sector. 
  Myanmar was becoming an important market for Malaysian palm 
oil since exports of the commodity to that country had increased 
from 78,355 tonnes in 1990 to 146,752 tonnes last year, he added. 
  Palm oil, which constituted 40 percent of Myanmar's oils and 
fats consumption, was wholly imported. 
  Dr. Lim said there were at present no joint ventures in the 
palm oil sector between Myanmar and Malaysia. 
  With the signing of the U.S.$25 million credit under the 
palm 
oil credit payment arrangement (POCPA) and increasing 
consumption of palm oil in Myanmar, there is a potential for 
some kind of collaborative and joint venture arrangements in the 
area of palm oil to be established, he added. 
  This included the setting up of refineries, bulking and 
packaging of palm oil products for local consumption as well as 
distribution to neighbouring countries. 
  Dr. Lim said Malaysia could also explore the possibility of 
establishing joint ventures with Myanmar in developing its 
mining industry since the country was well known for its rich 
mineral resources such as petroleum, coal, tin, zinc, iron and 
precious stones. 
  Malaysian exports of mineral-based items to Myanmar 
increased 
from RM7.5 million [Malaysian currency] (U.S.$1; RM2.5) in 1990 
to RM55.6 million last year while Malaysia's imports from 
Myanmar had remained static at RM14.8 million last year.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Asia-Pacific is one of, if not, the most dynamic 
regions in the world. Spectacular economic growth of fast 
developing countries of the region has been an inspiration and 
sometimes the envy of the rest of the world. However, this 
fortunate position should make the Pacific community 
inward-looking and discriminating against the other regions. As 
the prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, told the Pacific Basin 
Economic Council at its general meeting in Kuala Lumpur 
recently, we would be foolish if we of the Pacific got together 
in order to circle our wagons to raise barriers and to keep 
everyone else out. 
  The Malaysian leader knew what he was talking about. The 
Pacific Basin owes it to themselves and the global community to 
build upon the first foundation of a liberalizing economic 
system that will eliminate the obstacles to the flow of goods 
and services worldwide. That is the objective of the new world 
economic order as enunciated in the Uruguay Round. That spirit 
must be maintained at all times if the world is to progress 
harmoniously together. There are bound to be differences in 
approach towards achieving that goal. But there is a wealth of 
opportunities to work with those whose interest vary from one to 
the other. There are possibilities for agreements to be reached 
without creating insurmountable stumbling blocks in the way of 
progress and prosperity. 
  The Pacific era must be one in which areas of cooperation 
must be identified and utilized for the common good. These can 
include fields of communication, infrastructure development, 
banking and financial services, telecommunications, energy 
utilization, technology transfer, joint business ventures and 
above all, increase trade with and among each other. Malaysia 
has drawn praise from the EEC secretary general for its positive 
support for the speedy conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
  What is crucially important in this era of tension and 
conflict in different parts of the world is for peace, stability 
and security to prevail in the Asia-Pacific region. Everyone is 
aware that there is conflict potential in some areas of this 
region. If this is allowed to get beyond control, the entire 
strategic picture and future of the Pacific may be changed. But 
fortunately for the Pacific countries, the atmosphere has been 
made conducive for peace through political, social, and economic 
stability. The important thing for the countries in this region 
to pursue is to maintain this trend in order to replace enmity, 
confrontation, suspicion, and hatred wherever they may exist 
with a spirit of cooperative peace. 
  The Pacific era has dawned. The basin must strive toward 
open regionalism not only in the Pacific itself but at a global 
level as well.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 23 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
will step up its campaign on the use of palm oil among the 
people of China, which is the second largest importer and 
consumer of Malaysian palm oil, Malaysian Palm Oil Promotion 
Council chief executive Dr. Yusof Hashim said Thursday. 
  He said China, which imports 769,454 tonnes of palm, had 
potential to overtake Pakistan as the biggest consumer of palm 
oil in the world in view of its large population. 
  He (?told) a press conference that a three-week mission 
would 
be sent to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong next month to explain 
the uses and advantages of palm oil. 
  He believed the mission would be successful because the use 
of palm oil in China was currently confined to making noodles 
and soap. 
  Palm oil is not sold as cooking oil in China. The campaign 
will concentrate on the housewives and if it is successful, the 
use of palm oil will increase manifold, he said. 
  Dr. Yusof also said that Indonesia was expected to rival 
Malaysia as the biggest palm oil producer in world by the year 
2010 when its production caught up with Malaysia's at 10 million 
tonnes. Malaysia produced 7.4 million tonnes last year and 7.5 
million tonnes this year. 
  However, this would not affect Malaysia's exports as most of 
the Indonesian production was for local consumption and the 
world demand for palm oil was increasing yearly, he said. 
  On the anti-palm oil campaign in the United States, he said 
the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) had extended by three 
months to Aug 28 the deadline to remove the no palm oil lable on 
cans and foodstuff. 
  He said consumers in the U.S. had now changed their attitude 
and were beginning to try out palm oil while some big fast-food 
chains like Burger King in Florida had asked for samples for 
trial tests.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] has decided 
to step up its efforts both at home and abroad toward gaining a 
permanent seat in the UN Security Council [UNSC]. The decision 
has been made because concerns have been voiced in some quarters 
of the Japanese Permanent Mission to the United Nations, among 
other relevant offices, that "Japan is not making itself clear 
on this issue in comparison to Germany," as well as because the 
ministry has judged that the public now has a deeper 
understanding of the issue. MOFA plans to make stronger appeals 
to UN member nations in the process of unfolding its UN 
diplomacy and conducting bilateral talks. 
  Currently, the issue of Japan's bid for a permanent seat in 
the UNSC is being discussed at a working-level panel on 
reforming the current framework of the UNSC, and efforts are 
underway toward working out details in preparation for a report 
which is to be compiled by September. 
  In this connection, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa spoke at 
an Upper House Budget Committee meeting on 15 June, reiterating 
Japan's strong bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. He said: 
"Countries being considered as candidates for permanent 
membership in the UNSC has been narrowed down to Japan and 
Germany." Hisashi Owada, Japanese ambassador to the United 
Nations, likewise, clearly indicated Japan's bid for a permanent 
seat in the UNSC when he used the term "permanent member of the 
UNSC" for the first time at an 8 June meeting of the 
working-level panel on reforming the UNSC framework. 
  During the time of the administration of former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, such officials as then Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura were cautious about Japan's bid for 
a permanent membership in the UNSC. As a result, "distorted" 
relations existed between the Prime Minister's Office and MOFA. 
However, such relations have ceased to exist under the 
administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, resulting in 
improved relations between the Prime Minister's Office and MOFA. 
Thus, MOFA is now able to take a more determined stance toward 
Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UNSC. All this has 
contributed to MOFA's stepping up its efforts in this direction. 
At the same time, MOFA's move has also been triggered by the 
fact that the results of a recent MOFA public poll have shown 
that a majority of the Japanese people support the nation's bid 
for permanent membership in the UNSC. 
  However, opposition parties have raised objections to MOFA's 
stance. For example, Shusei Tanaka, acting representative of 
the Sakigake [Harbinger Party], has said: "MOFA is acting on its 
own. Sufficient debate has not been held to clarify the 
advantages and disadvantages of becoming a permanent member of 
the UNSC." A senior official of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan has also said: "Currently, a broad understanding of the 
people has not been gained regarding the issue." Apparently, 
MOFA hopes to get the public involved in the issue by going as 
far as to stir up a controversy.

  [Text] The government decided on 23 June to hold talks 
with North Korean officials to discuss ways to resume the 
stalled Japan-DPRK normalization talks. This has been disclosed 
by a top Foreign Ministry official. During his telephone 
conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa has asked that the United States urge 
North Korea to resume the stalled Japan-DPRK normalization talks 
when it holds high-level talks with that country and instructed 
Foreign Ministry officials to begin preparations for the talks 
with North Korean officials. 
  Both the United States and North Korea are expected to 
resume 
the stalled third round of high-level talks early next month and 
North and South Korea are moving toward holding an inter-Korean 
summit meeting. In this way, moves are afoot to "resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue." These moves have 
made the government feel the need for Japan to hold a dialogue 
with North Korea. The Japan-DPRK normalization talks have been 
stalled since last November. 
  The top Foreign Ministry official has pointed out that the 
"issue of Yi Un-hae" [a Japanese woman allegedly abducted to 
North Korea] -- who allegedly educated Kim Hyun-hi, who was 
sentenced to death for blowing up a Korean airliner -- and the 
issue of verifying North Korea's past nuclear development would 
stand in the way of resuming the stalled Japan-DPRK 
normalization talks.

  [Text] As 1995, which marks the 50th anniversary of the end 
of World War II, approaches, the recent visit of the [Okinawa 
Prefecture] governor to the United States to appeal for 
"tangible solutions to bases issues" emphasized petitioning the 
U.S. Congress, particularly the Armed Services Committee. This 
was the first time that Okinawa has been able to speak about the 
actual situation on the island directly to the influential 
chairman of this committee, who was instrumental in passing in 
the House of Representatives the bill on reviewing national 
defense in FY 1995, which partly aims at consolidating U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa. While it is still unknown whether 
any concrete action will be taken in the House, the "key 
mission" of this visit can be said to have been accomplished. 
  The United States, which used to maintain that "pending 
issues relating to Okinawa are Japanese domestic problems," now 
says that "there is a need for the Japanese and U.S. Governments 
to discuss these problems." There has indeed been some progress 
in its attitude. Thomas Bird [name as transliterated], acting 
assistant secretary of state, referred to working-level efforts, 
saying "we will work for solutions to the problems at the 
Japanese-U.S. joint committee." Marine Corps Commandant Carl 
Mundy also said, "Action by both governments is important." 
  The security conference held in Tokyo in March confirmed 
efforts toward the retrenchment, consolidation, and 
reorganization of U.S. military bases on Okinawa. Remarks made 
by U.S. Government officials during the governor's visit to the 
United States were based on such an agreement. 
  However, the United States would actually like to maintain 
its military bases. According to Representative Patricia 
Schroeder, with whom the governor held a discussion, when she 
submitted a bill last year asking that the "reorganization of 
military bases taking place in the United States be extended to 
overseas bases," the Department of Defense strongly opposed the 
bill, saying "U.S. military bases on Okinawa are of special 
strategic importance." This was an indication that basically, 
the U.S. Government has a strong desire to keep [its bases on] 
Okinawa.

  [Text] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is 
poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet 
to the Diet. Commenting on the LDP's move at a 23 June meeting 
of members of the House of Representatives and the House of 
Councillors who are affiliated with the ruling Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP], DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa pointed 
out: "If the no- confidence motion against the Hata cabinet is 
approved in the Diet, then the Hata cabinet would resign en 
masse, leaving no possibility of Prime Minister Hata becoming 
again prime minister." He went on to say, "the Hata cabinet 
should think of its voluntary general resignation while watching 
as the LDP submits a no-confidence motion to the Diet." He also 
stated that the Hata cabinet should study the possibility of 
resigning en masse depending on the outcome of talks with the 
opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on forming a 
new coalition and the SDPJ's internal situation.

  [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on 
18-19 June to investigate such data as trends in the rate of 
public support for the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata. The results of the poll showed that the support rate for 
the cabinet fell to 48.2 percent, a drop of 3 percentage points 
over the previous month. This is the first time the cabinet 
support rate has fallen below the 50-percent mark since the 
formation of the coalition government last summer. The 
percentage of poll respondents who said they did not support the 
cabinet rose to 36.9 percent, a rise of 3 percentage points over 
the previous month. Apparently, the fragility of the current 
administration, which lacks stability in carrying out its 
policies, has accounted for the drop in its support rate. For 
example, 46 percent of non-supporters said they did not support 
the administration because "it lacks stability." Although its 
support rate is still high in comparison with those marked by 
past administrations during the days of Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] rule, the Hata administration, which runs a minority 
government, is expected to face a severe test in managing 
government affairs as the current Diet session approaches its 
final rounds. On the other hand, however, the support rate for 
the LDP -- which has made firm its plan to submit a 
no-confidence motion against the Hata administration and is 
stepping up its moves toward overthrowing the administration -- 
dropped to 23.2 percent, the lowest support rate recorded ever 
since the party was established. Thus, the party has so far 
failed to gain public support for its strategies. 
  The support rate for the Hata administration was 51.6 
percent 
in a poll conducted last month immediately following the 
inauguration of the administration. This is the fourth highest 
in Japanese history among support rates marked by an 
administration immediately after inauguration. Although the 
latest support rate for the Hata administration dropped slightly 
from last month, it is still higher than the highest support 
rates marked by past LDP administrations under former Prime 
Ministers Takeo Miki, Masayoshi Ohira, Hayato Ikeda, and Eisaku 
Sato. 
  Among supporters of the Hata administration, 37 percent said 
they supported the administration because "it is better than 
past LDP administrations"; 32 percent said they supported it 
because "it is likely to do something new"; and 28 percent said 
they supported it because "it is eager to achieve political and 
economic reform." 
  As reasons for their not supporting the Hata administration, 
36 percent of the non-supporters cited a "lack of stability." 
Another 36 percent said they did not support the 
administration because "the prime minister does not have real 
power." Still another 36 percent said they did not support the 
administration because "it seems to be unable to get anything 
done at all." 
  Among male respondents to the poll, 49 percent, or nearly 
the 
same percentage as last month, expressed support for the Hata 
administration. However, the support rate among female 
respondents fell to 47 percent, a drop in 6 percentage points 
over last month. Among respondents in their 30's, 46 percent 
expressed support for the Hata administration, while 43 percent 
of those in their 40's expressed support. In either case, the 
support rate dropped by a noticeable 7-8 percentage points over 
the previous month. 
  Regarding support rates for political parties, 23 percent of 
the respondents expressed support for the LDP, 11 percent for 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 9 percent for the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and 4 percent for the Japan 
New Party [JNP]. For the last three months, the LDP's support 
rate has increased slightly, but in the latest poll it dropped 
by 3 percentage points over last month, falling below the 
previous record low of 23.7 percent marked in a poll conducted 
last February. The support rates for the SDPJ and the JNP 
increased slightly, while that of Shinseito remained at the same 
level as last month.

<F P=106> [Article by Kyoto University professor Nobuo Noda: "Repeated </F>
Folly of Party Politics"] 
  [Excerpts] The political reform-related law was approved by 
the Diet at the end of January and for the present a partial 
settlement has been made of the political reform problem that 
had been pending for many years. However, will Japanese politics 
really be greatly improved by this? I think that it is best not 
to expect too much. Far from the fact that we ought not expect 
too much, I fear that if it goes poorly, this will be the 
demarcation point where Japanese politics loses its dynamics, 
slides into an endlessly fluid situation 
and, as a result, we depart from party politics. 
<H5>  Development Cannot Be Expected Just by Introduction of a </H5>
System 
  There are people who advocate that party politics based on 
policy will be carried out by this new electoral system with the 
parallel system of a single-seat electoral district and 
proportional representation system, and a two major party system 
capable of alternating political power will be realized in Japan 
also. That, however, will probably end up as an illusion. That 
is to say, it is because a series of cultural and historical 
conditions must be present for party politics to function well, 
notwithstanding the contents of the electoral system. 
Conversely, even if changes are seen just by introduction of the 
system, the development of stable party politics should not be 
expected when the proper base for that is meager. That is to 
say, the more we are a nation with a shallow tradition of party 
politics, the more it is necessary to be mindful of cautious, 
gradual progress with sufficient consideration of the nation's 
cultural and historical conditions. Just by viewing the 
circumstances of their approval, I have to think that it is very 
doubtful that the recent political reforms were formed on such 
mature consideration. 
  When the cold war ended, "the end of history" was mentioned 
in the sense of the final victory of the West European form of 
democracy, and a dominant mood of optimism that the West 
European form of democracy would probably quickly spread 
throughout the world in the future. However, optimism had to 
turn to pessimism before many years passed. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Clear Division in Western Camp </H5>
  However, the end of the cold war made clear not just that it 
would be difficult to introduce the West European form of 
politics into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet nations. 
Ironically, the end of the cold war exposed to the light of day 
in a brutal form the division between the nations that have 
really acquired the West European form of party politics and the 
nations that have not within the Western camp which was supposed 
to have gained victory in this war. 
  The politics of the various advanced nations of Western 
Europe were greatly shocked by the end of the cold war, but if 
observed closely, the way that they reacted to it differed 
according to the nation. In the United States, the United 
Kingdom, France, and Germany, the partial rise of a new 
political force (at times, a radical force attacking the status 
quo) was seen, but in general, so far it has not gone to the 
point of fundamentally overturning the framework of existing 
party politics. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Strange Coincidence Between Japan and Italy </H5>
  Different from these West European nations, it has been none 
other than Italy and Japan whose framework of existing party 
politics was fundamentally overturned along with the end of the 
cold war. Both these countries belonged to the Western camp in 
the cold war era and adopted an apparent party politics form on 
the surface, but once the cold war ended, they inevitably slid 
into great political chaos upon receiving the full shock. These 
two nations have shown a strange coincidence to the point of 
political scandals exposed by prosecution authorities having 
become the direct trigger for that. [passage omitted] 
  Even with just a brief glance like this at the recent trends 
of domestic politics in various nations of the world, the 
character of recent political reforms in Japan should become 
visible. 
  At one time, the domestic politics of various nations in the 
world was very shaky amidst the chaos brought by world panic 
with 1929 as the starting point and, ultimately, the split into 
two camps became decisive between the various democratic nations 
of Western Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 
France, which maintained a framework of party politics in some 
fashion, and the various axis nations of Japan, Germany, and 
Italy, which departed from a party politics basis. As history 
repeats itself to an uncanny extent in certain aspects, today in 
the 1990's, after about 60 years have passed, within the 
political and economic chaos of the post-cold war era, again it 
seems that the domestic politics of the various advanced nations 
are beginning to branch into two directions. In other words, 
into nations that are trying to maintain at any cost the 
continuity of party politics, such as the United States, the 
United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and nations such as Japan 
and Italy that are striving for "a reorganization of the 
political world" by sweeping clean the existing framework of 
party politics. 
<H5>  Unfamiliar "Departure From Zero" in Party Politics </H5>
  I want to remind you, speaking for myself, that Japan and 
Italy do not appear to be proceeding directly to dictatorships 
as they did between the two world wars. However, it appears at 
first glance that the "political reform" or "reorganization of 
the political world" which these two nations are attempting 
right now should welcome the reform of all politics, but 
actually that is not the case. The very idea of striving for a 
completely fresh start once former political party relationships 
have been swept clean is not familiar to party politics. The 
reason is that party politics has the healthy character of, on 
the one hand, continuing to adhere obstinately to the continuity 
of history and, on the other hand, causing a blast of small 
revolutionary changes in the form of alternating political 
power. Starting everything over again from zero by simply 
abandoning adherence to the history of parties themselves is an 
idea far away from party politics. 
  Look at the United States or the United Kingdom. In the case 
of these countries which have a long tradition of party 
politics, people are wary about changing the framework of 
parties to the extent that it can be called timidity. In the 
United Kingdom, with World War I at the beginning of this 
century as the demarcation point, a switch was seen from the two 
major party system of the Conservative Party and Liberal Party 
to the two major party system of the Conservative Party and 
Labor Party. However, the switch in this party system was 
achieved after a very long preparation process. Labor union 
activities developed for a long time chiefly under the shadow of 
the Liberal Party until the Labor Party came to shoulder one 
pole of the two major party system, and moreover, even after the 
Labor Party was born as an independent party, there was a 
cooperative relationship period between the Liberal Party and 
Labor Party that was known as "Lib equals Lab." Thus, the switch 
in party political systems in the United Kingdom actually was 
finally realized after patiently waiting for the maturation of 
conditions. 
  This is probably not the exception even in a case where the 
Labor Party might wane in the United Kingdom in the future and a 
party comes to perform a role in the two major party system in 
its place. More than anything else, that a political party in 
this country that was born as the Tory Party in the 17th century 
continues to exist as heir to that tradition today at the end of 
the 20th century is a fact that makes us Japanese swoon. In both 
the United Kingdom and the United States, this adherence to 
history to the point of obstinacy is said to have caused the 
continuation of party politics over many eras of history and not 
been a hindrance. 
<H5>  Consideration of Inheritance of History and Tradition </H5>
Necessary 
  It follows from the foregoing that in the countries of Japan 
and Italy where the tradition of party politics is shallow, it 
is much more necessary to cultivate cautiously what seem to be 
the buds of party politics that have rarely shown their face in 
the past and to tend to the continuity of party politics. 
Inherently, particularly in the case of Japan, there have been 
scant differences in culture within society to be enough to 
support the distinction of several parties. For that alone, it 
is necessary to set great value on the history and tradition of 
parties once there has been an attempt to create them in the 
past, and on the other hand, even if political reform is carried 
out, to give adequate care to the inheritance of history and 
tradition. If that is not done, even the precious buds of party 
politics that have tried with much effort to raise their heads 
will inevitably be lost in a single stroke. 
  In the past, Japan had tried, little by little, to cultivate 
something resembling party politics from the end of the Taisho 
period [1912-1925] to the beginning of the Showa period 
[1926-1988]. However, once dictatorships appeared in Italy and 
Germany, we followed after them with loud cries about the 
corruption of existing party politics and the need for "reform" 
and, finally, the situation leaned rapidly in the direction of 
"a new system" and "support politics." At that time also, it was 
preached that everything existing was corrupt and liquidation 
was necessary, but even in the recent political reform, the same 
logic of eliminating essentially all that exists has gone 
unchallenged. So, the adherence to the history of political 
parties to the point of obstinacy which the people have shown in 
various Anglo-Saxon countries, the birthplace of political 
parties, can be called completely lacking. It has not been that 
no criticism at all has been heard in the media about these 
reforms, but I think that the view that preaches the necessity 
of care about the continuity of history which I have pointed out 
here has not appeared at all. 
  If you are a sharp reader, undoubtedly you have already 
noticed a striking fact in reading my treatise so far. Although 
Japan, Germany, and Italy advocated reform of politics and 
similarly turned to the denial of existing politics between the 
two world wars, this time only Japan and Italy are acting in 
concert, and Germany has been very wary about changing the 
framework of existing politics. Certainly, this fact has very 
important significance in considering the character of recent 
Japanese political reform. 
  In Japanese political reform, there was probably awareness 
of 
the West German or German system when it began to be discussed 
several years ago. In the end, however, the Japanese electoral 
system that is supposed to be introduced by the recent political 
reform has settled into the form of a so-called coexisting 
system, not a combination of a single-seat electoral district 
system and proportional representation system as in Germany. In 
other words, the new electoral system of Japan is not one that 
gives substantial priority to a proportional representation 
system like Germany, and has become something with an 
incomplete, halfway character which is neither proportional 
representation nor a single-seat electoral district system. (On 
that point, Japanese political reform closely resembles the case 
of Italy which introduced a single-seat electoral district for 
three-fourths of the parliamentary seats and a proportional 
representation system for the remaining one-fourth.) However, on 
the point of providing assistance to political parties through 
public funds, it can be said that Japan is close to the German 
system to a certain extent. The reason is that public assistance 
to political parties corresponding to the number of votes won in 
the election has been offered in Germany since the era of West 
Germany. 
<H5>  No Study of Germany on Important Points </H5>
  The problem, however, is that Japanese political reform, 
while picking at the German system like this, has not tried to 
study Germany on more important points like strengthening the 
position of the prime minister, for example. I have introduced 
it several times so far, but under the basic laws (Constitution) 
of Germany, a system of so-called "constructive nonconfidence" 
has been adopted concerning the chancellor and it has become a 
mechanism whereby so long as a majority of parliament does not 
agree on the next chancellor, the incumbent chancellor cannot be 
made to resign by nonconfidence. This is the system that was 
introduced by West Germany after World War II, in consideration 
of the painful experience where successive administrations in 
the Weimar era after World War I alternated, politics became 
unstable, and ultimately invited seizure of power by the Nazis. 
  Thanks to this system, the regimes of West Germany, or 
Germany since unification, have all been able to be 
comparatively stable long-term regimes, and the evil of frequent 
change of cabinets as in the Weimar era have been avoided. It 
must not be forgotten that this system is behind the Kohl 
administration that was born in 1982 and which overcame the 
rough seas of the collapse of the "Berlin Wall" and unification 
of Germany and has maintained its long life until today. The 
incorporation of a German-style "constructive nonconfidence" 
system instead of adopting an incomplete electoral system and 
heading in the direction of destroying the framework of existing 
political parties for Japanese political reform also probably 
would have brought a much more desirable effect over the long 
term. 
  Of course, regardless of various systematic devices under 
the 
Bonn basic laws, how long in the future German party politics 
can continue to exist in peace is a question that is rather 
difficult to foresee. At least up until now, however, German 
party politics has succeeded in maintaining continuity without 
experiencing a decisive interruption on the occasion of the 
shift from the cold war period to the post-cold war period. That 
probably merits admiration considering that the shock which this 
nation sustained by the conclusion of the cold war was much more 
enormous than for Japan. Therefore, the foolish, dangerous 
matter of frivolous changing regimes and changing the framework 
of party politics has been learned as a lesson from its own 
history between the two world wars. 
  Japan, however, has not consulted this valuable example of 
Germany and, along with Italy, is once agaom trying to follow 
the track of its own history between the two world wars when it 
simply got rid of the existing political framework. Just like 
the respective splits which the Christian Democratic Party and 
Socialist Party realized before the general election based on 
the new electoral system in Italy, if a general election were 
conducted under the new election system in Japan also, the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] would probably split and we would see the birth of 
a series of new parties. However, would a party politics system 
capable of stable change of power be generated after that? 
<H5>  If Viewed With Detachment, It Is First Step Toward </H5>
Dissolution 
  In the case of Italy, it is said that a power distribution 
largely of a moderate coalition, leftwing coalition, and 
rightwing coalition will appear after the collapse of the 
existing political parties. However, it can be easily surmised 
from outside observation that Italian party politics does not 
seem to be stable based on this new power distribution. Similar 
to that, even though the recent political reform of Japan seems 
to have some hope for that result so long as it is viewed 
domestically, if viewed from outside with a little detachment, 
it actually can be perceived comparatively easily that it is the 
first step directed to dissolution of party politics. 
  I previously stated that adherence to history was 
indispensable for the development of party politics. However, 
that does not mean that I want to advocate that we should 
protect the so-called 1955 order of the cold war comprised of 
the LDP and SDPJ. A change of power between political parties 
based on this system has never occurred, and consequently, there 
is no need to remind you again that this system is not a healthy 
form of party politics. Moreover, since the SDPJ which shoulders 
one pole in this system has a different constitution than the 
socialist political parties of other West European nations, it 
will be difficult for it to avoid losing its life force along 
with the demise of the cold war. 
  However, it is again necessary to recall on this occasion 
that the sham change of power between political parties in the 
form of competition between factions within the LDP has just 
barely been conducted under the 1955 order. That has been a 
precious experience of political competition cultivated 
spontaneously somehow or other within the Japanese political 
climate of high conformity. Of course, the previous lively 
competitive relationship between factions has been lost, such as 
the creation of a general mainstream faction within the LDP at 
the end of its regime and the creation of an inflexible 
seniority system concerning minister posts. Consequently, 
various reforms within the party will probably be necessary such 
as, for example, expansion of a primary election system for 
election of president or making the term of president at least 
four years and strengthening that position. However, if 
political reform is carried out, it should probably shift to 
implementation in a form joining it in some way with the 
experience of the LDP which has continued for many years in the 
past. That is to say, as repeatedly stated, it is because the 
more that one is a nation with a meager tradition of party 
politics, the more necessary it is to hold dear the buds of past 
party politics. 
  Indeed, if a general election is implemented under the new 
electoral system, it is very likely that several significant new 
political parties will probably be born. However, enough 
differences in culture to support the opposition of permanent 
political parties like in Europe and the United States do not 
exist in Japanese society today. (Previously, the differences of 
rural culture represented by Kakuei Tanaka and the urban culture 
represented by Ryokichi Minobe existed to a certain extent.) 
Nevertheless, under the situation today where ideology has waned 
when there has been an attempt to establish distinctions in 
political parties, even though difficult, in the platform, the 
platforms of all parties will probably end up being 
indistinguishably noncommittal. 
  If this happens, politicians will repeat the past, 
nonchalantly crossing the fences between parties to seek the 
position of prime minister or minister and, within several 
years, the distinction between the new political parties will 
probably lose its meaning. Not only will such degeneration occur 
in central politics, but also a general ruling party surrounding 
influential legislators who have won election from the various 
single-seat electoral districts will undoubtedly be built at 
local politics level. Seeing that a general ruling party system 
centered on governors is today already being created in many 
prefectures, it must be said that such a probability is very 
high. 
  As a test, you should open a recent local newspaper and try 
to gather what is occurring on the stage of local politics 
today. In the central political world, Diet members are 
separating into various parties such as the LDP, Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], and the Japan New Party and are moving 
around, but when it comes down to the level of prefectures or 
municipalities, examples have been created here and there where 
local legislators who previously belonged to the LDP have 
mutually separated and dispersed into several parties, or one 
legislator is sitting on the fence, belonging to both a 
coalition ruling party and the LDP. 
  Why has this happened? Local politicians are trying to 
prepare for any kind of change that may occur in the central 
political world no matter how much tearful effort they put in. 
Then, whatever form of regime appears centrally, they will 
protect their own political careers as local legislators, and 
moreover, they are eager not to interrupt derivative benefits 
from the center to their own region. However, the recent reality 
of such local politics, turned the other way, tells only that 
the distinction of Japanese political parties on the grassroots 
level is at most vague. 
<H5>  Are New Parties Worthy of the Name Political Party? </H5>
  Are the political parties Shinseito, Japan New Party, and 
Sakigake [Harbinger] that were born one after the other because 
of the change in government in the summer of last year really 
worthy of the name political party? For example, the political 
party Japan New Party could not have been formed apart from the 
politician Morihiro Hosokawa and, if he loses his political 
career, it will probably inevitably be headed for extinction in 
almost no time. The same thing can be said about the 
relationship of Sakigake and Masayoshi Takemura. The political 
groups with this character are no more than political groups for 
the purpose of putting one politician in the seat of prime 
minister and are probably not worthy to be called political 
parties at all. Shinseito, which was born last summer, is no 
more than a group within a powerful faction of the LDP which 
split, became independent, and is called a political party. When 
you consider this, it must be said that the series of new 
parties that appeared along with the change of government in the 
summer of 1993 are actually not political parties and their 
constitution has not left the realm of LDP faction. 
  Many advocates forecast that, if political reorganization 
gradually proceeds with the introduction of the new electoral 
system, many of the current political parties will be 
consolidated in big blocs such as "conservative" or "liberal," 
and those blocs will respectively become genuine political 
parties. However, I do not believe these kinds of predictions at 
all. Even if such a political map should be maintained for a 
while, neither "conservatives" or "liberals" will be able to 
extricate themselves from the character of a faction coalition. 
Then, factions within the various political parties will easily 
cross over such political walls of "conservative" and "liberal" 
to participate in an administration and will probably develop 
complicated bargaining of alliances and confederations. After 
inherently incompatible political parties like Shinseito and the 
SDPJ joined hands under the Hosokawa coalition regime, the 
creation of any combination of political forces except for the 
Japan Communist Party would not be strange at all. 
<H5>  No More Than Expanding Scope of Faction Struggles </H5>
  As far as political reorganization which should be called 
political reform is concerned, after all, the actual state of 
Japanese politics in the future will essentially not change from 
the struggles among factions surrounding the posts of prime 
minister and minister which have unfolded within the LDP until 
now. If there is something different from the past, it will be 
no more than just an expansion of the scope of faction struggles 
from just the LDP to include the SDPJ, Democratic Socialist 
Party, and other political parties. Then, the bargaining among 
factions will become more complicated than it was previously 
just within the LDP in proportion to the expanded scope of 
faction struggles. It will be saturated with a 
behind-closed-doors character and then become something 
difficult for the general public to understand. Indeed, viewing 
the process up to approval of the recent political 
reform-related bill, wasn't it more difficult to understand the 
behind-closed-doors character than the previous process of 
making up their minds within the LDP? That is believed to be an 
omen that the principles and actual state of Japanese politics 
under the new system will be more disparate than before. 
  Finally, I would like to point out that it is a fact that 
recent political reform has progressed almost completely cut off 
from foreign policy issues. In the inauguration of the Hosokawa 
coalition regime, the realization of political reform was cited 
as the task with the highest priority, and they inherited the 
course of the LDP administration on foreign policy and security 
policy. That is to say, the ruling coalition, which included 
parties from Shinseito to the SDPJ, actually did nothing but put 
off as much as possible important decisions concerning foreign 
policy and security policy because they could agree only on the 
task of promoting political reform. 
  As a result, other than approving in principle the 
deregulation of rice in connection with the Uruguay Round 
compromise, the Hosokawa regime spent its first six months 
almost idle regarding foreign policy and security. This fact 
will undoubtedly become a large point of contention on par with 
the contents of political reform in later discussions on the 
successes and faults of the Hosokawa regime. That is to say, it 
is because the international political situation surrounding 
Japan in this six-month period was decidedly not so calm that 
the government could put off important decisions. Rather, it is 
no exaggeration to say that a grim international situation, 
requiring the most attention by Japan since the end of the cold 
war and featuring the North Korean nuclear problem and economic 
negotiations between Japan and the United States, appeared 
during this period. If by chance the Japanese Government 
neglected to devise appropriate measures concerning the North 
Korean nuclear problem or U.S.-Japan economic relations in this 
period, it may become most regrettable when looking back over it 
later. 
  To begin with, the concept of "deal with domestic political 
reform first and then international politics" indicates 
inadequate awareness of international politics in the post-cold 
war period which has been intensely fluid. In addition to having 
already spent the last six months idle for the most part while 
the international situation in Asia surrounding Japan has been 
moving rapidly, if the next half year or year is spent on 
political reorganization along with political reform, there is 
probably even a danger of the international isolation of Japan 
in that period. Moreover, if prospects are slim for domestic 
political reform and political reorganization to be able to 
produce enough clear-cut results worth that much of a sacrifice 
in the foreign policy aspect, it is believed that an unlucky 
turn in Japanese politics is not far off in the future. 
<H5>  Danger of Dropping Out From Western Europe Camp </H5>
  Many Japanese view as none of their business the condition 
that Russia and the East European nations are suffering in the 
move to a West European form of party politics after having been 
freed from the control of communist regimes, and they are under 
the false impression that their own nation is an advanced nation 
concerning party politics. However, if Japanese party politics 
cannot break loose at all from the confusion and, moreover, if 
Japanese isolation in international politics becomes obvious 
after this political reform, the dissolution of Japan's party 
politics is probably a matter of time. Aren't the people, 
exasperated by political reorganization that never makes much 
progress, abandoning party politics that cannot deal with 
international politics and beginning to look forward to 
supraparty nationwide politics depending greatly on the 
bureaucracy? 
  Although Japan is supposed to belong to the West European 
democratic camp which triumphed in the cold war, there is a 
great danger that we will drop out from this camp along with 
Italy before we realize it. We must persist in remembering the 
history of the first half of the 20th century when we drank a 
bitter cup in that, while becoming a victor nation along with 
the United States and the United Kingdom in World War I, we 
ultimately were unable to cultivate party politics patiently and 
turned to the anti-Western Europe camp in international politics 
and the domestic political system.

  [Text] The yen (Y)-dollar rate temporarily plunged below 
Y100 to a dollar on 22 June. In this regard, top officials of 
the four economic organizations pointed out that "it is a big 
shock to the economic world because there were signs that the 
Japanese economy was about to begin recovering from stagnation 
and that the yen exchange rate was becoming stable," (according 
to Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Federation of 
Economic Organizations). The top officials demanded that the 
government take concrete measures, including income tax 
reduction and deregulation, to reduce Japan's trade surplus. 
They also asked the monetary authorities to strongly intervene 
in the money market. 
  Chairman Toyoda also said: "An appropriate level of the yen- 
dollar exchange rate is between Y110 and Y120. Actual gross 
national product for fiscal 1994 will drop by 0.8 percent if the 
exchange rate of Y100 to the dollar continues for a year." 
  Ken Hayami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers 
Associations, stressed: "We may even have industrial 
stagnation, increased unemployment, and social unrest if we 
allow yen's abnormally high value, which does not reflect the 
actual economic conditions." Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the 
Japan Chamber o Commerce and Industry, expressed his concern, 
saying that "it will be a serious blow to small-to-medium-sized 
enterprises." 
  Yu Hayami, representative secretary of the Japanese 
Association of Corporate Executives, stated: "The dollar fell 
against all currencies as a result of apprehension about 
possible inflation in the United States and other things. Even 
the United States cannot tolerate the dollar's further decline."

  [Text] The export industries, which are directly affected 
by the appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar, 
are greatly alarmed by the recent rapid rise in the yen exchange 
rate. They claim that, "This is a serious situation that may 
offset all our strenuous efforts at restructuring," (according 
to Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation). 
  Yen appreciation is not only seen to affect business 
performance. "We are just beginning to see partial signs of 
recovery in the Japanese economy as a whole, and in automobile 
sales. We have also hoped that the substantial income tax cut 
would really bring about economic recovery. This will seriously 
impair the signs of recovery," (according to Tatsuro Toyoda, 
chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association). 
Many business leaders are seriously concerned about the effects 
on the economic climate and domestic consumption. 
  According to estimates by Yamauchi Securities' Economic 
Research Institute on the adverse effects of yen appreciation, 
if the yen- dollar exchange rate goes down by one yen per dollar 
for a year, this will cut total profits of the 11 automakers by 
30 billion yen, profits of the five computer companies by 16 
billion yen, and those of the five home appliances makers by 11 
billion yen. 
  All Japanese companies claim that "the only way out is to 
cut 
costs by importing manufactured goods, engaging in overseas 
production and expanding overseas procurement," (according to 
Hideo Hirotsu, vice president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). 
While they seem ready to take further measures to deal with yen 
appreciation, most of these businesses have already been 
grappling with this problem. They grumble that "this is beyond 
our self-help efforts," (according to Reiichi Yumikura, chairman 
of the Japan Chemical Fibers Association). 
  Furthermore, many point to the vicious circle of further 
measures to deal with yen appreciation harming the economic 
conditions and business profitability in turn. Some assert 
that, "If this situation continues, it will accelerate the 
hollowing-out process in the manufacturing industries," 
(according to Hajime Murata, chairman of the Japan Petrochemical 
Industry Association). Others maintain that, "The prices of 
internationally competitive products will have to be raised, and 
as a result, this will further delay the recovery of business 
profitability," (according to Yoshihiko Wakumoto, managing 
director of Toshiba Corporation). 
  For the above reasons, the business sector is asking the 
monetary authorities to "work for the stability of the exchange 
rates through the cooperation of the advanced nations" 
(Takeshiro Miyashita, chairman of the Japan Paper Association) 
in order to stop the further appreciation of the yen and 
depreciation of the dollar. It also wants the government to 
take additional economic stimulation measures, and implement 
steps to correct the trade imbalance as soon as possible. 
Toyoda says, "We want definite measures to vigorously expand 
domestic demand, such as continuing the income tax cut and 
additional investment in social infrastructure."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Need to Overreact to Dollar Depreciation"] </F>
  [Text] The yen exchange rate made a dramatic drop to below 
100 yen to a dollar for a time. However, what is happening now 
is an overall drop in the value of the dollar against all major 
currencies, rather than an appreciation of the yen. 
  Compared to 4 May, when more than 10 central banks of the 
advanced nations engaged in coordinated intervention in the 
foreign exchange market, the situation is somewhat different. 
  First, the monetary authorities of the major powers did not 
engage in coordinated intervention in the exchange market on 21 
June. The fact that the Bank of Japan [BOJ] went into vigorous 
dollar buying in the Tokyo market the next day, 22 June, 
indicates that Japan apparently wants to have coordinated 
intevention. 
  The reason why this did not materialize could be either 
problems about the effectiveness or technicalities of 
intervention, or the monetary authorities of the United States 
and Europe could not reach a consensus. 
  Second, the economic condition in Europe has improved 
considerably, and Japan is seeing signs of an economic recovery. 
Such circumstances may have affected policy coordination among 
Japan, the United States, and Europe. 
  What triggered off the Black Monday (stock prices crash) in 
October 1987 was the conflict of interests between the monetary 
authorities of the United States and (then) West Germany. 
Coordination among the advanced nations is indispensable for the 
stability of the currencies. This historical lesson should be 
recalled at this time. 
  On the contrary, it is possible that the U.S. monetary 
authorities may ask Japan to lower its official discount rate in 
the name of policy coordination to defend the dollar and stop 
yen appreciation. 
  Behind the massive selling of the dollar are apprehensions 
about inflation, as well as the relatively low interest rates in 
the United States. There is a strong possibility that the U.S. 
Federal Reserve Board (FRB) may raise the official discount rate 
to defend the dollar, and Japan will be called upon to cut 
interest rates together with the United States. This would be a 
pattern identical to that during the coordinated lowering of 
interest rates in March 1986. 
  What we want the Ministry of Finance and the BOJ to do is to 
be very careful about coordinated lowering of interest rates. 
We must not allow a repeat of the bubble economy. A mistaken 
policy option in the name of coordination with the United States 
is unacceptable. 
  In that sense, there is no need to overly fear the 
depreciation of the dollar and appreciation of the yen. There 
has been a sharp rise [as published] in crude oil prices, which 
are quoted in dollars, as a result of dollar depreciation. 
Concerns about imported inflation in the future cannot be 
totally discounted. 
  In such a case, yen appreciation serves to shut off imported 
inflation. There should be further efforts to narrow the gap 
between domestic and overseas prices to pursue benefits arising 
from yen appreciation. 
  On the other hand, there is an opinion that since the real 
interest rates in Japan are still relatively high, there is 
still room for further lowering of the official discount rate. 
  In the decisionmaking process, the most important thing is 
to 
accurately gauge the economic conditions in Japan and the United 
States. Compared to last year, when Japan was weakened by the 
damage of yen appreciation, present Japanese economic condition 
has more vitality. However, in terms of the prevailing economic 
conditions, it is too early to lower the official discount rate. 
  Is the U.S. economic condition really sturdy? We see partly 
cloudy skies. If the perception of the Japanese and U.S. 
economies changes, there will be correponding changes in the 
exchange rates. 
  Exchange rates will probably be a major issue at the Naples 
summit (meeting of leaders of advanced nations) to be held in 
Italy in July. Along with efforts to reduce current accounts 
surplus by expanding domestic demand and opening up the market, 
Japan may be asked to lower interest rates. 
  The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have resumed, but it 
remains uncertain whether an acceptable conclusion can be 
reached before the summit. The United States remains 
discontented with Japan's tax reform. However, monetary policy 
should never be used as a tool of compromise.

  [Text] On 21 June, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] announced a report stressing the need to promote 
direct investment in Japan by foreign-affiliated enterprises as 
a way to help revitalize local economies. In its report, MITI 
points out it has become difficult for foreign-affiliated firms 
to advance into Tokyo due to high land prices, among other 
factors. Among key points which the report stresses will help 
promote efforts to attract such firms to rural districts are the 
following: 1) to draw up a program regarding attracting 
foreign-affiliated firms to Japan in which local governments 
will play the main role; 2) to implement more measures which 
offer financial and other incentives to foreign- affiliated 
firms; and 3) to build an information network. As a new policy 
for fiscal year 1995, MITI now plans to work out details of its 
program for promoting foreign investment in Japan based on this 
report. 
  The report was compiled by the "Committee for Promoting 
Smoother Domestic Investment in Rural Districts" (a private 
study panel under the director of MITI's Industry Policy 
Bureau). In its report, the panel asserts that the advance of 
foreign-affiliated firms into Japanese markets will promote 
competition within the domestic economy and help increase 
productivity. It asserts this will consequently contribute to 
rectifying the gap in commodity prices in Japan and abroad. It 
stresses that in rural districts, in particular, extensive 
exchanges among firms with differing customs and traditions will 
lead to the increased possibility of the birth of new local 
industries as well as to the internationalization of rural 
districts, and an increase in employment opportunities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Koshiro Ishida, director general of the Management 
and Coordination Agency and Katsuyuki Hikasa, minister of the 
posts and telecommunications, are set to meet on 22 June to make 
a final decision on a draft package of deregulatory measures 
that have been studied by the Information and Telecommunications 
Panel under the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters 
[headed by Prime Minister Hata] of the government. The draft 
package of deregulatory measures calls for lifting the ban on 
the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to urban 
public telephone circuits managed by the Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation (NTT), in both international and domestic 
telephone services and for reducing the inspection of radio 
stations run by domestic telephone companies from once every 
year at present to once every five years. The draft package of 
deregulatory measures also calls for relaxing the current 
regulation on the output of local radio stations. In this way, 
the draft package of deregulatory measures, if put into effect, 
would provide noteworthy convenience for domestic telephone 
subscribers and also have a noteworthy effect on value-added 
network (VAN) companies and foreign telephone companies. 
  The backbone of the draft package of deregulatory measures 
in 
the information and telecommunications sector is to: 1) lift the 
ban on the connection of the exclusive business telephone 
circuits to the urban public telephone circuits; 2) to bring 
efficiency to the use of radiowaves; and 3) to regulate charges 
imposed by telecommunications companies and curb the issuance of 
service licenses. 
  Foreign VAN companies have strongly asked that Japan lift 
its 
ban on the connection of exclusive business telephone circuits 
to urban public telephone circuits. The Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications [MPT] has already announced its decision to 
lift the ban on the connection at home. As a result of lifting 
the ban, the NTT has suffered a nearly 40 percent fall in 
long-distance telephone charges and a sharp decline in the 
number of its subscribers. Fearing their adverse effect on the 
NTT's management, MPT has taken relief measures, including 
allowing the NTT to impose additional charges. MPT plans to 
take measures to prevent drastic changes from occurring in the 
international telecommunications sector, and the ban on the 
connection of exclusive business telephone circuits to the urban 
public telephone circuits will be lifted next year. 
  The number of deregulatory measures on the use of radiowaves 
is more than 10, the largest amount. The issuance of individual 
licenses for radiowaves used by transmit stations for mobile 
telephones (portable and car telephones) will be abolished and a 
"comprehensive frequency designation system" will be introduced 
whereby the use of all usable frequencies are approved. The 
current inspection period of large-scale telecommunications and 
radio stations will be extended and they will be inspected only 
once every five years. 
  In the broadcasting sector, the current regulation on the 
output of community broadcasting stations, which are also called 
mini-FM stations, will be relaxed. Their output has been 
regulated uniformly to one watt, and the regulation has been 
criticized as incompatible with the situation in local 
communities. MPT plans to relax the regulation in terms of not 
causing jamming after surveying the number of enterprises or 
individuals hoping to open the community broadcasting stations 
and potential demand for the community broadcasting stations. 
MPT plans to relax the regulation in early 1995. 
  In addition, measures will be taken to evenly distribute 
frequencies to local communities. As part of the effort to 
support multimedia, the principle of excluding concentration on 
the mass media in the broadcasting sector will be eased. The 
current exceptional scope for regulations on charges imposed and 
services provided by telecommunications companies that do not 
require approvals from MPT will be expanded. 
  The relaxation of "the demand and supply adjustment clause," 
that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the 
Keidanren [the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan] 
have strongly demanded, will be deferred until later. The 
ministry and the Keidanren have strongly demanded its 
relaxation, claiming that the clause is a basic regulation on 
participation in and withdrawal from the telecommunications 
business in Japan. As a result, the current situation, wherein 
MPT approves participation in the telecommunications business 
only when it concludes that the participation does not adversary 
affect the management of other existing telecommunications 
companies, will continue. MPT will continue to study ways to 
revamp the current tender system for the use of radiowaves, and 
the revamping of the system is not included in the draft package 
of deregulatory measures.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Seiyu Take 1.41 Billion Yen Loss; </F>
Will Take Over a Part of Telecomsat Satellite Cable Circuit 
Resale Operations"] 
  [Text] Seiyu will take a 1.41 billion yen loss when it 
liquidates its Telecomsat (Minato-ku, Tokyo) satellite cable 
circuit resale operations on August [1994] but will continue one 
part of operations. Telecomsat was engaged in the business of 
leasing repeaters from privately operated communication 
satellite firms and reselling cable circuits to corporations for 
intra-firm reception of television broadcasts, but had 
accumulated deficits totaling 2.289 billion yen since its 
startup in 1988 and had decided to liquidate during a special 
shareholders' meeting held in March. Regarding the operations 
which will continue, Seiyu will boost its cable circuit resale 
activities and its software division for program supply and aim 
for profitable operations by the end of fiscal year 1995. 
  The continued cable television operations will be placed 
under the control of Seiyu's Communications Broadcasting 
Operations Department. Reportedly, Seiyu received a Type II 
Class Communications Satellite Operator's license from the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in May of this year. It 
will continue itscircuit sale services with its three corporate 
clients and continue to supply educational programming which is 
sent to 60 locations. 
  Telecomsat is capitalized at 1.1 billion yen, with Seiyu 
being the largest shareholder controlling 19 percent of the 
company along with investments by Kawasaki Steel, Tokyo 
Broadcasting System and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. 
Aside from the 300 million yen in capital paid in, Seiyu holds a 
loan valued at 1.11 billion yen payable by Telecomsat.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Key Tech Center Reports </F>
Japan-U.S. Cooperation Essential for Development of 
Next-Generation Telecommunication Satellites"] 
  [Text] The Japan Key Technology Center, a special 
corporation chartered by the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and 
chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa, recently completed a report titled, 
"Survey Concerning Next-Generation Intelligent Satellite 
Technology." The report suggests there will be an increased 
demand for services via "intelligent satellites" capable of 
high-level communication functions as a result of rapid 
expansion in the use of multimedia and cellular telephones. It 
recommendsefforts toward developing essential technology under 
an international cooperative effort between Japan, the United 
States, and Europe. 
  The report predicts that the early 21st century will witness 
fixed stations on earth that are linked by high-volume 
communication optical fiber cable networks, and a much higher 
level of importance for communication satellites because of a 
rapid expansion of demand for cellular telephones, personal 
communication systems and multimedia. It also suggests the need 
to develop multifunctional satellites capable of handling image 
transmissions for multimedia and cellular phone services. 
  The report analyzes that the key to development of 
"intelligent satellites" with such capabilities will involve 1) 
Technology to operate repeaters at a low voltage; 2) Technology 
to transmit and process image signals efficiently, and 3) 
Standardization and mass production of parts. The report also 
covers the importance of launching many low-orbiting satellites 
to build a network. The report also stresses the need for 
international coordination among advanced nations to promote 
standardization and the effective use of satellites, although 
that Japan, the United States, and Europe currently are 
developing next-generation communication satellites 
independently.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Telecommunications and 11 Major </F>
Electrical Equipment Companies Form Multimedia; Coordinate 
Multimedia Equipment"] 
  [Text] Eleven leading information, telecommunications and 
electrical equipment makers including NEC, Fujitsu and 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Company will organize a research 
committee by July to coordinate standards for multimedia 
equipment to handle animated images and voice on an integrated 
basis. Worldwide efforts, mainly in the United States, are 
underway to standardize multimedia communication formats and the 
objective of the committee will be to establish a forum to 
coordinate future interconnectability of the wide variety of 
equipment expected to be offered by manufacturers. The objective 
is to seek expansion of market potential by providing for user 
convenience. 
  The temporary name of the research committee will be 
"Multimedia Promotion Research Committee [MPRC]." The initial 
call for the committee was made by the Communications Industry 
Association of Japan (chaired by Jun Jinguji, president of Oki 
Electric Industry Co., Ltd.) and NEC, the two firms mentioned 
above and Hitachi, Ltd., Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric 
Corporation, Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd., Sony Corporation, 
Sharp Corporation, Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., and Matsushita 
Communication Industrial Co., Ltd. have been fonfirmed as 
participants. 
  The research committee will coordinate multimedia standards 
for newly developed information telecommunications equipment and 
is expected to submit proposals to the government concerning 
deregulation and legislation necessary for building the 
next-generation communications network infrastructure to be used 
by multimedia companies. The 11 companies and three related 
organizations including the Communications Industry Association 
of Japan, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, and 
the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association have just 
established a preparatory committee which will decide on the 
activities to be handled by the research committee. 
  The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications estimates that 
the multimedia industry will expand into a huge market covering 
hardware, software and services valued at 123 trillion yen by 
the year 2010, and electrical, information and communications 
companies are actively engaged in product development.

  [Text] Hitachi has put together a plan to boost sales of 
electron beam (EB) drawing equipment, which seems to be 
promising in next-generation IC [integrated circuit] manufacture 
use with its high resolution, to 3 billion yen this fiscal year, 
1.5 times that of the previous year. Since semiconductor 
manufacturers are aggressive in new facilities investment, the 
outlook is for orders to increase for manufacturing process use 
to draw circuit patterns directly on wafers, in addition to use 
in mask manufacturing. Other main products such as etching 
equipment also seem to have surpassed the performance of the 
previous fiscal year, and the outlook for sales for all 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment this fiscal year is a 
7.5-percent increase (43 billion yen) compared to the previous 
fiscal year, an increase for the second consecutive year. 
  Besides EB drawing equipment and etching equipment, the 
company is manufacturing and selling a kind of length measuring 
SEM (scanning electron microscope) scanning devise. The external 
sales ratio is over 80 percent. 
  The EB drawing equipment on which sales efforts have been 
put 
this fiscal year is a product that began full-scale external 
sales last fiscal year. Generally, EB's are often used for mask 
manufacturing, but the company is making its main force the use 
of "direct drawing" where the pattern is drawn on the wafer 
without using a mask. Processing speed is slower than a stepper 
and it seems unsuitable for mass production, but production 
efficiency is being raised by adopting a new transfer method of 
putting together patterns in block units, and Hitachi is 
beginning combined use with a stepper in ASIC 
(application-specific IC) manufacture. It aims to seize this 
timing to expand sales.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Technological Innovation Is the Only </F>
Alternative for Japan"] 
  [Text] The white paper on finance titled, "Financial and 
Economic Trends for 1993," issued by the Bank of Japan on 2 June 
[1994] provides an easy-to-understand analysis of reasons for 
the extended economic sluggishness and provides an outline of 
future economic recovery. 
  Despite having implemented economic stimulous measures 
totaling 45 trillion yen in four stages, difficulties have been 
encountered in placing the economy back on the road to recovery. 
The questions are why and what remedial action is required? The 
"white paper" provides an effective response to those questions. 
  Causes for the protracted recession include stock 
adjustments 
associated with capital investments, housing investments, and 
consumer durables. Further, balance sheets of firms that used 
debt to purchase land and buildings at inflated prices during 
the bubble economy and of banks that issued such loans have 
deteriorated because of the collapse of the bubble. The adverse 
effects of such asset deflation are a widely mentioned topic. 
  An important aspect of the "white paper" is that it lists as 
a third factor in the extended recession the structural 
adjustment of Japanese industry. The structural adjustments have 
been required by a change in the international competitive 
environment led by the explosive growth in China's manufacturing 
capabilities and rise in U.S. manufacturing productivity. 
  China, whose labor rates are two percent of those in Japan, 
is now becoming the world's factory. Mass production technology 
for high-tech products, which was once considered Japan's 
specialty, is in the process of being transferred to Asian 
nations including China. Such changes are forcing Japanese 
industries to undergo structural adjustments calling for 
specialization in technology intensive products. 
  The white paper's analysis stating that the future economic 
recovery will be slow in tempo is of a persuasive quality when 
one considers the two obstacles of balance sheet adjustments and 
structural adjustments. The principal role that government 
should play as a matter of policy would be to assist in this 
structural adjustment in the private sector and to establish 
efficiency in providing government services to minimize the 
burdens associated with the pending aging of society. 
  Viewed historically, effective measures that could be taken 
by advanced industrialized nations in competing with rapidly 
growing developing nations include devaluation of currencies, 
protectionism, and technical innovations. However, lessons 
learned during the economic depression of the 1930's rule out 
the use of protectionism. Many advanced nations have made 
efforts at modest currency devaluations, but the yen continues 
to be strong. Moreover, Japan cannot afford to abandon 
principles of free trade. 
  Accordingly, preservation of economic vitality in Japan in 
the 21st century will require technical innovation of a 
considerable scope. 
  The core of technical innovation must consist of an 
information revolution. The white paper suggests that the key to 
structural adjustments is a bold relaxation of government 
regulations. 
  Concurrently, the government must take action to improve 
immense inefficiencies associated with administrative services 
through the use of information revolution. In March [1994], U.S. 
President Clinton announced a plan to reduce the federal work 
force by 270,000 in five years. They say that congressional 
hearings are held daily on how to combine information and 
administrative reforms. 
  A requirement is the systemic improvement of Japan as a 
whole. We must increase efficiency in industrial, social, and 
administrative systems and build a new type of welfare state. 
Preservation of old systems combined with a shot in the arm will 
not solve our problems. We must learn our lessons from a history 
of economic failure and high welfare nations where the people 
lost incentives to work. 
  Desirable is that central and regional government employees 
deal with restructurings in a manner similar to that undertaken 
by the private sector to attain revolutionary improvements in 
efficiencies in the area of government services. 
  Deregulation will represent the core of all required 
actions. 
Common access to information based on optical fiber networks 
will probably provide for significant increases in efficiency. 
Administrative reform is not limited to manpower reductions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Disposal of Nonperforming Assets </F>
Requires More Time"] 
  [Text] On 2 [June 1994], the Bank of Japan (BOJ) published 
the so-called white paper on finance titled, "Financial and 
Economic Trends for Fiscal Year 1993." It provides the 
assessment that write offs of nonperforming assets reached 
historically high levels in fiscal year 1993 and comments, 
"Financial institutions have demonstrated the desire to 
aggressively dispose of bad assets," but that a further 
extension of sluggishness in commercial real estate is expected 
and complete disposition of such assets "will require 
considerably more time." Relative to the deterioration of 
balance sheets based on falling asset values, the white paper 
explains, "There are signs that worsening balance sheets may 
have reduced the capability to assume risks," and adds, "The 
impact (on the macroeconomy) should not be disregarded." In 
summary, the white paper indicates: 
  1. The recession in our nation which started in the spring 
of 
1991 continued in fiscal year 1993. As a result, the recent 
recession has proven to be severe in comparison to past 
recessions, both in terms of length and scope. 
  2. Prices such as domestic wholesale prices moved on a weak 
basis throughout the fiscal year based on a strong yen and 
easing of the supply and demand ratio for manufactured goods 
while there was a considerable decline in the rate of increase 
of prices for services provided to businesses. Further, consumer 
prices stabilized increasingly because of steady labor costs and 
an increase in cheap imported products. 
  In the area of current account balances, the effects of the 
strong yen caused a decreasing trend in the real trade surplus 
between the spring of last year to year end. However, the 
dollar-based trade surplus and current accounts surplus both 
rose sharply to new historical highs because of a strong yen and 
increase in overseas investment income. 
  3. The extended recession called for continuation of the 
relaxed monetary policies in fiscal year 1993. In September 
1993, the BOJ reduced the official discount rate to the 
historically low level of 1.75 percent. 
  4. Loans issued by financial institutions declined 
throughout 
the year, while the money supply grew slightly over fiscal year 
1992, at a low rate. That trend was based on a) sluggish demand 
for capital to invest in real assets amidst a prolonged 
recession; b) financial restructuring of businesses, and c) 
decline in capabilities of businesses to assume risks based on a 
drop in asset values. 
  However, recent monetary easing has contributed to rising 
investments in housing and an underpinning for corporate profits 
based on lower interest rates. Further, monetary easing 
functioned to provide for an environment that enhanced the 
feasibility of restructuring of businesses and financial 
institutions, thus serving as a factor to sustain the economy. 
  5. The financial system reflects substantial write offs of 
bad loans during fiscal year 1993 over the prior year by banks 
throughout the nation, indicating that financial institutions 
took unprecedentedly aggressive action in the disposal of bad 
loans. It appears that such actions were made possible because 
of a favorable financial environment including the ability to 
procure capital at a stable low cost and firm stock prices and 
the favorable impact of revisions in systems for handling write 
offs and reserves for bad loans. Even among financial 
institutions, there seems to be a growing desire to enhance 
future competitiveness through the aggressive disposition of bad 
loans. However, extension of sluggish conditions in the 
commercial real estate market will require considerably more 
time before completion of bad loan disposal actions by financial 
institutions. 
  6. The persistence of the recent recession was caused by a 
concurrent adjustment process on three fronts to include a) 
cyclical stock adjustment; b) balance sheet adjustments required 
as a result of the collapse of the bubble, and c) pressure to 
adjust the industrial structure based on changes in 
international competitiveness emanating from a strong yen 
throughout 1993. 
  7. Fluctuations in asset values centered on real estate 
after 
the mid-1980's have caused major losses on the balance sheets of 
businesses and households which used debt to acquire assets 
during the period of rising asset values as well as the 
financial institutions that issued loans for such purchases, 
only to be followed by a decline in asset values. It is believed 
that the deterioration in balance sheets of such economic 
entities and decline in risk assumption capabilities had a 
restraining effect on overall economic expenditures. It is felt 
that as a minimum that these conditions have led to sluggish 
growth in loans by financial institutions and in the money 
supply despite a major decline in interest rates and the 
extended recession in capital investments in the small and 
medium businesses in the nonmanufacturing sector. However, it is 
difficult to quantify the impact of balance sheet adjustments on 
current economic trends. 
  8. World economic trends in recent years reflect spectacular 
economic growth in East Asian nations that have an abundant 
supply of low-cost labor. And in the United States, productivity 
has risen in the manufacturing industries, primarily in the 
computer and automotive sectors. Such developments have caused 
changes in the relatively superior status of Japanese 
industries. The economy of our nation is undergoing a long-term, 
structural change referred to as an adjustment in the industrial 
structure, in addition to restructuring in response to a 
cyclical change in revenues. 
  In the manufacturing sector, a rapid expansion is taking 
place in imports of labor-intensive goods from East Asian 
nations. Further, mass production of medium-range high-tech 
goods, which Japan has comparative advantage, has been 
transferred not only to Europe and the United States but to East 
Asian nations via direct overseas investments. Such steps have 
led to an active shift to overseas production of existing 
products such as automobiles and electrical equipment. The 
changes have caused Japanese businesses to convert to production 
of technology intensive products. Even in the nonmanufacturing 
sector, lower overseas production costs associated with a strong 
yen and the effects of deregulation have caused a phenomenon 
called "price destruction." This development has functioned to 
reduce foreign and domestic price differentials through 
efficiencies installed in the distribution system and serves as 
an underpinning to bring about real improvements in household 
incomes. Elimination of foreign and domestic price differentials 
has worked to promote restructuring in the existing 
nonmanufacturing sector. 
  9. An increase in improving economic indicators has been 
experienced recently and the economy as a whole manifests signs 
of bottoming. As the economy improves in the future, there is a 
strong possibility that the impact of adjustments in balance 
sheets and industrial structures will have a moderating effect 
on the pace of the recovery. There is the possibility that the 
pattern of economic recovery will differ from the past when 
consideration is given to the varying progress made on stock 
adjustments and severity of balance sheet deteriorations in the 
respective economic sectors (with conditions being more 
favorable in household balance sheets as opposed to those for 
businesses) and the positive or negative effects of economic 
restructuring on the respective economic entities. 
  10. Structural adjustments in the industries of our nation 
are inevitable as a response to structural changes in the world 
economy. Revisions in government regulations will be of crucial 
significance in promoting such adjustments and to enhance the 
capability of Japan's economy to respond to worldwide changes. 
In other words, relaxation and repeal of regulations by Japan 
can contribute to: a) establishment of feasibility in forming an 
internationally efficient production pattern based on the 
construction of a horizontally arrayed division of labor with 
nations of the world, especially East Asian nations, in the area 
of trade; b) promotion of efficiency in non-trade goods sectors 
and enhancement of real purchasing power based on lower consumer 
prices, and c) development of new business sectors and expansion 
of new industries. 
  11. Methods for dealing with surpluses in the current 
account 
are also an issue for Japan. The cyclical portion of surpluses 
in the current account attributable to differentials in external 
and domestic growth rates should lessen as Japan moves toward 
economic recovery. On the other hand, other portions of the 
current account surpluses will be affected by Japan's basic 
savings and investment balances and are not expected to 
disappear on a short-term basis.

<F P=106> ["Full Text" of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's Letter to </F>
King Sihanouk -- date not given] 
  [Text] May I beg your Majesty's forgiveness for any 
possible inappropriate expressions that might occur in my letter 
and the inconveniences it created to Your Majesty while you are 
on your medical treatment. 
  I was forced by the current situation to write this letter 
which is intended on the one hand to make clarification on a 
number of issues, and on the other hand to solicit Your 
Majesty's advice on some issues that I have to address, namely 
the solution to be brought to the Khmer Rouge problem and the 
issue of conferring state power to Your Majesty. 
  Regarding the solution to the Khmer Rouge problem, so far 
some allegations have been made that my humble person as well as 
Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, especially my humbleself 
were the obstacle to any accommodation with the Khmer Rouge, 
moaning that "Hun Sen is the hardliner opposed to any 
accommodation with the Khmer Rouge." 
  In this regard, I could not really understand, because I 
have 
done nothing but conforming myself to the Constitution which 
resulted from the elections. Concerning the Khmer Rouge problem, 
it is well known that the Khmer Rouge are opposed to the Paris 
Agreements, to the elections, to the Constitution, and to the 
elected Royal Government. 
  Now, they oppose Your Majesty's initiative of national 
reconciliation starting with the ceasefire. They even dare to 
demand that a new government be formed which is tantamount to 
the dissolution of the legitimate institutions resulting from 
the elections and to nullifying all the efforts jointly exerted 
by the whole Cambodian people and the international community in 
implementing the Paris Agreements. 
  They are continuing this warfare, the assassination of 
innocent people, committing untold tragedies to the nation and 
to the people and yet the Khmer Rouge could get away with it and 
everything was blamed on Ranariddh-Hun Sen who are only 
exercising their legal obligations of protecting the people. 
  Some people said that the Royal Government refused to 
accommodate because it preferred the military option to destroy 
the Khmer Rouge. In this regard, allow me to say, Your Majesty, 
that for the moment, the Royal Government has no choice. The two 
rounds of Round Table (peace-talks) failed because of the Khmer 
Rouge. May I also inform Your Majesty that my humble person, Hun 
Sen, now is a little bit different from the Hun Sen prior to the 
Paris Agreements and from the post-election Hun Sen: then I had 
two important options either to continue to fight or to seek a 
solution by ways of the Paris Agreements, either not to accept 
the election result and to rekindle the flame of war or to 
accept the election results to avoid warfare and to create 
conditions for national reconciliation. 
  But for the moment, the Khmer Rouge do not leave Samdech 
Krompreah and myself with any option since the Khmer Rouge have 
decided to opt for warfare against the nation and the 
population. There are indeed two other options that I certainly 
could not go along: 
  1. to accept the Khmer Rouge demands of dissolving the 
National Assembly, the elected Royal Government and to form a 
new government with the Khmer Rouge in it. Proceeding this way 
is equivalent to a cool coup d'etat since even the Constitution 
will have to be scrapped or suspended. I have no mandate to go 
that far, but this is the prerogative of the National Assembly. 
But in my capacity as an MP, I will certainly vote against such 
a proposal because it constitutes an outrageous concession 
tantamount to a legal coup d'etat to dissolve the Constitution, 
to dismantle the National Assembly and the Royal Government 
elected by the people. It is also a big blow to the achievement 
of the UN operation in Cambodia just for the sake of exchanging 
it with the participation of the genocidal group. 
  2. for the sake of avoiding combat initiated by the Khmer 
Rouge's offensive, the Royal Government was forced to withdraw 
from the areas where the Khmer Rouge aim to occupy. Doing so 
would allow the Khmer Rouge to expand their control over the 
territory and the population, and it will not be long before the 
Khmer Rouge would control the whole of Cambodia. For me, the 
above two options are impossible. But I don't know whether there 
are any personalities who can accept the above two mandates. If 
there are, they should come out to take my position and carry 
out these tasks, which is better than to go about fomenting 
social unrest. 
  Your Majesty, 
  There were times when I did not want to hear allegations 
that 
"Hun Sen was the obstacle to accommodation with the Khmer 
Rouge," I picked up my pen and wrote my resignation, so as to 
make way for the Khmer Rouge easy return. But this act of mine 
would have resulted in the disappointment among the population 
and would provide a good opportunity for Khmer Rouge genocidal 
group, pro-Khmer Rouge group, Khmer Rouge sympathizers and those 
who use the Khmer Rouge as counterweight to achieve their 
objectives, to be satisfied as they no longer need to destroy 
the achievement of the Paris Agreements to come to power 
illegally. 
  After having enough said of the Khmer Rouge problem, may I 
now turn to the issue of conferring the state power to Your 
Majesty. 
  On this issue, I prefer not to make any judgment because I 
have received two different sets of information. The first one 
directly from Your Majesty on the morning of May 18, 1994 when 
Samdech Chea Sim and myself accompanied Your Majesty and Samdech 
Preah Mohesei from the Royal Palace to Pochentong Airport. Your 
Majesty mentioned that "there are people who accuse me of 
wanting to take power. But I am too old, what do I want the 
power for? And the Constitution provides that the King reigns 
but does not govern." 
  Successive information received also proved that Your 
Majesty 
denied the allegations that Your Majesty wanted to resume power. 
  Another set of information was that Your Majesty needs to 
take direct state power, there was even an attempt to foment a 
manifestation in support of the request to confer the power to 
Your Majesty. As the first hand information and the relayed one 
were so different that I did not pay much attention. But on the 
evening of June 17, 1994,I was deeply shaken by the article 
published in the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW on June 23, 1994 
entitled "Cambodia -- Last Act" written by Nate Thayer, 
supposedly an interview with Your Majesty. 
  According to this article, I have become another obstacle on 
the way of conferring the power to Your Majesty. I do not know 
whether those were words of Your Majesty or whether the author 
creates the story himself. 
  With regard this issue, whether Your Majesty did say so or 
whether the reporter did not write so, may I be allowed to 
submit to Your Majesty as follows my thought and my feelings. 
  Whatever the turn of the political situation and more than 
half of life, I have always been following Your Majesty. My 
decision to go into the maquis on April 14, 1970 would not have 
been made then if was not for Your Majesty because then I had 
many options to choose from: to be a student, to be a farmer, to 
be a worker or to be a businessman etc... Through various 
situations, whether I hold the positions of a Minister, Deputy 
Prime Minister or Prime Minister, I always believe that the best 
way to put an end to the war was a political solution which 
would give an opportunity for Your Majesty to return and to lead 
the country. I have made it to become a reality. 
  Your Majesty and Samdech Preah Mohesei as well as the Royal 
Family and the non-communist resistant forces certainly have not 
yet been informed of all the hardships I have gone through in 
the search for a political solution in Cambodia. I had to face 
untold dangers so as to achieve this enormous and historical 
task. The influence of leaders of some countries exerted upon me 
to seek a red resolution which would have denied the roles to be 
played by Your Majesty and the non-communist resistant forces 
and which I did not accept was another kind of danger, which I 
would not reveal their names right now but would mention in the 
book to be published later on. 
  This brief mention of history does not mean that I want to 
take credit for it but just to show Your Majesty of what I have 
done for the nation and in following Your Majesty. On June 13 
1994, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut came to report to me about 
his trip to Europe. He also proposed for my consideration the 
issue of conferring the power to Your Majesty. To Prince 
Kromkhun, I expressed my view that no one has any doubt about 
the King who is our Father. 
  The National Assembly had conferred full power and special 
power to Your Majesty on June 14, 1993 with which Your Majesty 
was able to form a Provisional Government which was not at all 
provided for in the Paris Agreements and which led us to unite 
to produce a Constitution to be respected by everyone. Any 
change or amendment to the Constitution is of the mandate of the 
National Assembly. I further told Prince Kromkhun that it is not 
sure that the National Assembly would support any change of the 
Constitution. Moreover, Article 17 of the Constitution which 
mentioned that the King reigns but does not govern prohibits any 
change of it. On that occasion, I also shared with Prince 
Kromkhun my worries about the rumour saying that Your Majesty 
wanted to take power but Your Majesty always denied this rumour. 
Where is the truth? Is it a Khmer Rouge's trick to dismantle the 
Royal Government and to create a new one by exploiting Your 
Majesty's name? 
  Your Majesty, 
  I was very shaken when I read the REVIEW's article which 
mentioned that "Sihanouk acknowledged that his bid for power 
would be doomed without the acquiescence of Hun Sen and the CPP 
[Cambodian People's Party] ... because I do not want to shed 
blood to fight for a secession led by Hun Sen... unless I have 
the assurance that Hun Sen and his party will join me in my 
government." 
  This paragraph is very serious vis-a-vis myself because it 
implies that a war might break out not by the Khmer Rouge but by 
my humble person. Now, a group of people in Phnom Penh who are 
unscrupulously greedy of power are using this article to poison 
the atmosphere going so far as telling Thai businessmen not to 
work with the current government because it is about to collapse 
and to wait to work with the new government. It is very funny 
because the Khmer story is like a kid's game since a press 
article may be able to dissolve or to form a government. This is 
too simple and the Constitution seems to be worthless. Everyone 
is boasting of pro-liberal democracy but instead is violating 
the nation's Constitution. What do they really want, 
dictatorship or democracy? 
  May I take this opportunity to submit to Your Majesty that 
the question of dismantling the incumbent Government and 
creating a new one, of appointing anyone as Prime Minister, 
Deputy Prime Minister, does not depend on me but rather on the 
Constitution and the National Assembly. I can walk out and led 
Khieu Samphan to replace me if it is allowed by the 
Constitution, if there is a support in the National Assembly and 
if it is necessitated by national interest. Therefore, there is 
no need to fear that I might wage a secessionist war. What I 
need right now is a truth whether Your Majesty really wanted to 
take power as the Prime Minister as it has been published in the 
media, so that I might assess according to the real fact. 
  Your Majesty, 
  I am very worried by the length of my letter and by its 
content. If I did not write and tell Your Majesty the truth and 
to seek the truth, confusion would prevail. I know very well 
that a number of people will accuse me of arrogance, daring to 
write to His Majesty the King. But Your Majesty is well aware 
that I am not a reserved person and not a "yes-man". Your 
Majesty used to say that Hun Sen is like Your Majesty. 
Specially, during the dinner on May 27, 1994, Your Majesty said 
that: "Samdech Hun Sen is not my son but he is like me: 
unreserved". This is my natural character of frankness. 
  I am writing this letter to request Your Majesty's advice 
with regard to the above-mentioned issues. As far as the 
solution to the Khmer Rouge is concerned, how can I and the 
Royal Government address this problem? How to address the 
rumours surrounding the question of conferring the power to Your 
Majesty? I am awaiting Your Majesty's noble advice for further 
action.

<F P=106> [From the "Today's Comment" column by So Naro, secretary </F>
general of the Cambodian Journalists Association: "We Do Not 
Want To Exchange Hun Sen for Khieu Samphan"] 
  [Text] The horrifying news carried in the letter from 
Samdech Hun Sen to the Cambodian king on 18 June, in which the 
former said he wished to resign from his post, has caused great 
alarm among the citizens. The Cambodian people would like to 
solmenly declare that we do not want to exchange Hun Sen for the 
genocidal gang of blood-thirsty butchers under whose reign of 
terror many of our grandparents, parents, children, and 
grandchildren died most miserably in their prison without walls. 
  The Cambodian people cherish and are always ready to follow 
His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the revered monarch 
of the Cambodian motherland. The king, however, is living so 
far away from his subjects. Will he be able to prevent the gang 
of butchers from murdering his beloved children and 
grandchildren again as during those three years eight months and 
20 days? Only Prince Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] and Samdech 
Hun Sen have all the potential and all the forces at their 
disposal to stop the black-shirted murderers from returning to 
power. If Samdech Hun Sen, who is a patriot and who once saved 
the nation, leaves the Royal Government and is replaced by the 
blood-stained bandits, the king's subjects will surely be 
miserable and wretched again. 
  His Majesty the father of the nation is begged not to listen 
to the sweet-talking, black-hearted Khmer Rouge who are very 
good in their divide-to-rule tactics. If they succeed in 
recapturing power, our revered nation, religion, and king will 
surely be just history. Seeing this sign of danger, the largest 
segment of the Cambodian people earnestly implores His Majesty 
the father of the nation to graciously maintain his trust in the 
Royal Government born out of the will of the people who are your 
loyal subjects. 
  Your Majesty should not forget the taste of the 
3-year-8-month-20-day regime to which you too were subject. 
This time, if the Khmer Rouge get the power back, they will not 
spare you. 
  The common people do not forget, but the common people are 
afraid Your Majesty might forget. The snare never forgets the 
heron; only the heron keeps forgetting there is a snare 
somewhere.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP June 23 -- National Assembly Chairman 
Chea Sim said he hoped that the members of the National Assembly 
will agree to outlaw the Khmer Rouge [KR] during the coming N.A. 
session. A draft law to outlaw the Khmer Rouge was made after 
the failure of round-table talks held in Phnom Penh on June 15 
and 16 in which the Maoist faction did not clearly response to 
King Sihanouk's proposal for a permanent, unconditional, 
immediate cease-fire. The draft will be submitted to the 
National Assembly for promulgation during its coming session. 
The bill could be passed unless it gains a majority of 
two-thirds from the members of parliament. 
  Also after the failure of peace-talks, the Royal Government 
decided to close the Khmer Rouge's office in Phnom Penh and the 
Ministry [words indistinct] all Khmer Rouge representatives to 
leave the city before June 19. 
  Chea Sim who visited the seaport of Sihanoukville on June 20 
repeated King Sihanouk's clarification saying: "If the 
peace-talks held in Phnom Penh fails to obtain success, there 
will not be a third round-table talks to be organised." 
  Second Prime Minister Hun Sen told a press conference while 
he was in Jakarta between June 20 and 22 that: "We won't have 
any more round-table talks with the Khmer Rouge." 
  Prince Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and Mr. Hun 
Sen, second prime minister, led the delegation of the Royal 
Government to visit Indonesia on June 20-22. 
  The Cambodian leader highly appreciated the role played by 
Indonesia in the non-aligned movement, "I'm very impressed," 
said the prince "by the socio-economic development and political 
stability of Indonesian government under the leadership of 
President Suharto." 
  He spoke of the urgent need of Cambodia in the 
reconstruction 
of socio-economic infrastructure after two decades of war, 
adding that the Cambodian efforts needed the contribution and 
the support from the countries in the region, Indonesia included. 
  "The process of the national reconstruction and development 
is threatened by the sporadic fighting between the Royal 
Government and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas," he said. 
  He affirmed that the Royal Government strongly supports 
[words indistinct] national reconciliation raised by his majesty 
the king and cease-fire [words indistinct] the king's initiative 
[words indistinct], he said. 
  The government must be responsible for ensuring the national 
[words indistinct] the country. The Cambodian co-prime 
ministers requested Indonesia to provide its aid to the Royal 
Government born from the general elections organized and 
supervised by the United Nations under the Paris agreement. 
  "The Royal Government are ready and eager to negotiate with 
Khmer Rouge to find a compromise acceptable to all parties for 
the national unity, peace and freedom," he said. 
  "We also ask the Paris accords signatories to strictly 
implement the accords so as to give international guarantee to 
the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, 
inviolability, neutrality and national unity in Cambodia," said 
Prince Ranariddh.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Kampuchea representative Chan </F>
Youran by unidentified correspondent at the 15-16 June 
roundtable talks in Phnom Penh; dated 23 June -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Greetings, Your Excellency. You 
recently attended the meeting in Phnom Penh of the roundtable 
commission for national reconciliation and peace. On behalf of 
the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia radio 
[VGNUFC], please comment on the two items on that meeting's 
agenda. Why did the meeting fail to agree on the agenda as 
called for by the Cambodian nation and people, who want national 
reconciliation and peace? 
  [Chan Youran] I would like to express sincere thanks to our 
VGNUFC for giving me the opportunity to talk about this meeting. 
  On 15 June, the meeting, chaired by Samdech Nhoek Chulong, 
representative of the king, agreed to abide by the king's 
guidance by adopting the following agenda. First, an 
unconditional, immediate, and permanent cease-fire nationwide. 
Second, the minimal policy program proposed by the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] to the meeting which has received the 
king's consent. 
  During the discussion about the agenda, our Democratic 
Kampuchea [DK] delegation expressed the following views: 
  1. The PDK was attending the meeting as a Cambodian side, 
equal to all other Cambodian sides, with rights equal to other 
Cambodian sides to discuss the two items. 
  2. Legally, these two items have the same status and value. 
The meeting's responsibility is to discuss the two items 
because they form an entity for national reconciliation and 
peace. If only one item is discussed and the other left out, 
this is neither just nor correct. This cannot solve the 
Cambodian problem and achieve national reconciliation quickly. 
  Our nation and people very much want a quick end to the war 
and their great suffering and hardship in order to have ordinary 
lives again. Our nation and people want genuine national 
reconciliation and national concord. Therefore, we ask that all 
sides take this opportunity to respond to the sacred aspiration 
of our nation and people by discussing the two items and 
striving to solve the problem gradually. 
  The representative of Prince Ranariddh, chairman of 
FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia], and the representative of Chea Sim 
and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party, puppet of communist 
Vietnam, did not respond to these views. They only talked about 
the cease-fire, but refused to discuss proper and strict 
supervision. They did not accept a competent committee to deal 
with this issue. So, our delegation said this: You are cheating 
on this cease-fire because it is not genuine and definitive 
throughout the country. It is not a cease-fire within the 
framework of national reconciliation. It is a cease-fire without 
proper and strict supervision by a competent committee or 
technical group. Furthermore, you did not say a word about 
national reconciliation because you are afraid of this. You 
refused to talk about the minimal policy program, which is the 
basis of the national reconciliation and peace policy. You only 
talked about the cease-fire to dupe national and international 
public opinion in order to continue fueling the war in Cambodia. 
  These people could not answer. They remained quiet; they 
were stuck. 
  Samdech Nhoek Chulong, chairman of the meeting, and many 
observers noted that our side's stance is correct and 
reasonable. For this reason, Samdech Nhoek Chulong decided to 
let our delegation read the PDK clarification on the minimal 
policy program. I read our address dealing with the minimal 
policy from the beginning to the end. These people had their 
heads down. 
  In sum, these people categorically oppose national 
reconciliation and peace. They oppose a genuine national 
government and national army in accordance with the sacred 
aspiration of our nation and people. 
  Our nation and people and the PDK, however, are absolutely 
determined to achieve national reconciliation and peace so that 
our Cambodia will not become a second Kampuchea Kraom [former 
Cambodian territory now part of southern Vietnam].

  [Text] Vietnam's land grabbing activities along the 
eastern border in Memot District, Kompong Cham Province, are 
spreading further without solution from any of the authorities. 
Cambodians living in this area are very angry because they have 
lost land on which they work to earn a living. 
  A rubber plantation official who requests anonymity says 
that 
in the past, standing on the mound in Bos Ta Kok village in Da 
commune, Memot District, and looking toward the Daeum Dong 
Prampil Daeum village, one can see the zinc-sheet covered roofs 
of Vietnamese houses built along the border. This area is an 
important smuggling point where Vietnamese wait to buy goods 
from Cambodia. 
  Now some Vietnamese have trespassed and intruded into Bos Ta 
Kok village in Da commune by clearing and leveling aroud 100 
hectares of red earth and openly took over between 20 and 30 
hectares of scattered rubber tree plots which had been the 
property of an official named Ret. The rubber plantation 
official also says that local people dare not poke their heads 
into this area because nearly all of these land-grabbing 
Vietnamese are armed. They look like an army unit. It is not 
known yet what will be done with the plot of land the Vietnamese 
have cleared and leveled, but latex is siphoned off daily. 
These Vietnamese have let it be known that they will not 
withdraw because this piece of land protrudes along the border 
and they consider it theirs. 
  The rubber plantation official, quoting many local 
residents, 
says that it is not only land in the Bos Ta Kok area that the 
Vietnamese have annexed; border markers along the entire 
district border have been moved deep inside Cambodia. The 
important thing is that along this border the Vietnamese have 
deployed troops, disguised as civilians, for protection. They 
are armed with assorted weapons, and at some places tanks have 
been stationed in the trenches. Only their cannons can be seen. 
  Is the government aware of this land expropriation in Bos Ta 
Kuk? Upon ceiving this information, please investigate and solve 
the problem immediately. First of all, the district authority 
has to immediately report to the Interior Ministry in order to 
solve the problem through legal means.

  [Text] Protests have continued in Jakarta following this 
week's closure of Indonesia's three leading news magazines. 
Michael Maher reports from the Indonesian capital that there 
are signs that the military are not fully behind the Suharto 
government's action. 
  [Maher] About 400 journalists and students, many dressed in 
black, gathered outside the department of information to demand 
the return of press freedom. Riot police tussled with 
demonstrators who spilt out on to the road waving banners 
critical of the government's action. It now appears sections of 
the military are also opposed to the bans on the news weeklies 
TEMPO, DETIK, and EDITOR. The official spokesman of the armed 
forces, Syarwan Hamid, is quoted in the Jakarta newspaper SUARA 
PEMBARUAN as saying that the closures are very regrettable and 
should not have happened. 
  Indonesia's human rights commission has described the bans 
as 
a step backward. However, government officials have since 
issued warnings to at least four other news journals about their 
reporting. Demonstrators say they'll continue their protest 
actions until freedom of expression is restored. 
  [Melbourne Radio Australia in English at 0800 GMT on 23 June 
adds: "The continuing protests come just days ahead of a visit 
to Indonesia by the Australian prime minister, Paul Keating. 
Mr. Keating will meet President Suharto in Jakarta on Tuesday 
[28 June], but it's not clear if the issue of the magazines' 
closure will be raised. A senior Australian official in 
Canberra said that if the media ban is discussed it will be done 
privately and quietly. Graeme Dobell reports. 
  "[Dobell] The senior government official said Mr. Keating's 
meeting with President Suharto would be unscripted and it was 
not possible to say whether the prime minister would raise the 
closure of the three Indonesian magazines. He said the foreign 
minister Gareth Evans had put Australia's position in parliament 
yesterday, when he described the ban as very disappointing. 
That statement had been passed to the Indonesian ambassador and 
Australia's view on freedom of the press had been registered. 
Mr. Keating leaves on Monday afternoon for a 48 hour trip to 
Jakarta to open an Australia-Indonesia business forum."]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Admire President Suharto's Open Criticism </F>
Against the Indonesian Press"] 
  [Text] When announcing the official construction of the 
Indonesian Navy's port at Teluk Ratai in Lampung last Thursday, 
President Suharto delivered his address without text. His 
address became a public topic for discussion. 
  First, the president's address without a prepared text was 
considered very interesting. As such, his reproach was more 
effective. A dialogue ensues every time the head of state 
delivers an impromptu address. 
  Second, the president issued a reminder to the press during 
his address at Teluk Ratai, Lampung. The newspapers, which had 
only limited access to the report on the purchase of 39 ex-East 
German warships, underscored the issue. The subsequent reports 
by the press resulted in creating an unclear situation, 
suspicion, and dissension. 
  The president stated that if such actions by the press were 
permitted to perpetuate, then this trend in reporting will 
disrupt the nation's stability and its political stability. 
National stability is an ingredient of the Trilogy of 
Development, which is made up of stability, development, and 
equal distribution. Therefore, we should put things right. 
Action should be taken against the press if it does not adhere 
to reminders. 
  The president's criticism was very clear and methodical. The 
public could react through diverse considerations in connection 
with the president's criticism and reminder. It would probably 
be wise for the public to react with care and wisdom when 
considering the president's criticism and reminder. 
  The president's remarks, which he made in Lampung, were 
neither God-sent nor without prior consideration. We are of the 
opinion that his criticisms came in the midst of the most recent 
developments. 
  There must have been at least two incidents when Information 
Minister Harmoko admonished the press, magazines, and electronic 
mass media officials in Jakarta and at district levels about 
being discreet and responsible in their reporting. He also 
reminded them to refrain from conducting a trial by the press 
[preceding three words in English], giving misinformation, and 
creating disunity. 
  Questions arose from the reports about the purchase of the 
39 
ex-East German warships. These reports from the mass media, 
both print and electronic media, are part of the effort to 
become more transparent and more open. The reports, however, 
were observed as being inconsistent, unjust, and unilateral. 
This could leave a negative impact on certain people. 
  The Indonesian mass media's varying methods and trends in 
reporting, whether by the print or electronic media, was 
observed to be more open in issues such as the Nipah Dam, the 
murder of labor activist Marsinah, and the Bapindo bank scam. 
  The mass media lie low every time an official issues a 
reminder, warning, or criticism in connection with their 
reporting. They only return to their previous trends after some 
time. Whatever credibility or background they possess, we have 
witnessed such occurrences before. 
  The media went to the extreme by reporting on the purchase 
of 
the former East German warships until President Suharto made a 
direct, clear, and in-depth criticism. 
  The president's criticism of the mass media received 
attention. Press circles have become more careful and discreet. 
This is observed in that Indonesian media reports and 
commentaries recently made thorough observations and sentiments 
were of a positive nature. 
  The developments taking place within the press are connected 
to those occurring within society which, for example, are 
directed toward openness. Openness is facilitated by the 
government in alignment with progress. Openness is actually a 
form of dynamism that thrives within society. It encourages the 
people's participation in development and political processes. 
  The exposure of the Bapindo bank scam caused by ET [Eddy 
Tansil -- the first accused in the Bapindo bank scam] and the 
subsequent legal process and press reports were evaluated as a 
constructive asset coming from the openness process. 
  In this regard, based on the importance of national 
development and people's interest, the issues of the Bapindo 
bank scam and the purchase of the former East German warships 
are considered similarly important. 
  Therefore, the authorities should place a caveat [preceding 
word in English] on openness as people become increasingly aware 
of the effects of openness and when this openness is similarly 
expressed through the mass media, the press, or even considered 
stronger within the government service sector. The government 
should also issue a reminder to the mass media to refrain from 
being too belligerent, embarking on trials by the press, being 
excessively primordial, and to totally abstain from inciting our 
multi-racial society. 
  It is most likely that encouragement exists everywhere for 
more dynamic competition. There is also a possibility of a 
subjective and partisan political motive. It is also probable 
that the issue was more concentrated on the effort toward 
reactivating the past format [format yang pas] of extremes. A 
unilateral form of openness can only support and channel the 
people's aspirations. Another form of openness can bring about 
excesses. 
  Both of these forms are sensitive. If there are people 
within society who are suppressed and their cries go unheeded 
and no constructive or corrective measures are undertaken to 
rectify the situation, then conditions will gradually grow into 
an explosive situation. On the other hand, there will be 
excesses if people do not fully assimilate openness in a 
positive manner. 
  Such was the president's candid criticism of the mass media 
when he urged them to correct their ways and to be more 
discreet. Meanwhile, the mass media should conscientiously heed 
the president's reproach when making their reports -- 
irrespective of the facts, figures, and other aspects they have 
to abide by. 
  This means that the president's aides should not only 
function as advisers for major issues but also function as 
coordinating agents to overcome disparity among the members of 
the community. 
  Finally, national and political stability can be breached 
not 
only through the issues and conditions brought to the fore by 
the mass media but through the existence of bona fide problems 
and conditions. Therefore, all parties should be more critical, 
constructive, and sincere in accepting the president's 
criticisms and advice.

  [Text] Jakarta, June 23 (OANA/ANTARA) -- President Suharto 
here Thursday called on the people to be aware of the nation's 
diversity, but not to exaggerate the nation's differences. 
  "We should not exaggerate differences existing among us. We 
should not forget that we are committed to being a united 
nation. Our slogan is unity in diversity. We are diverse but 
are determined to be united," the president said. 
  Receiving students from the fourth course of the National 
Defence Institute (Lemhanas) at the Bina Graha Presidential 
Office, the head of state said that the main challenges being 
faced by Indonesia are issues regarding human rights, openness, 
democratization, and the environment. 
  "Human rights, openness, democratization, and environmental 
issues could be abused to create unrest at home," Suharto said. 
  If this happened, he added, it would threaten national 
development and weaken national stability. 
  The president was accompanied by Defense and Security 
Minister Edi Sudrajat and Lemhanas Governor Lt. Gen. Mutoyib. 
  He said the challenges facing Indonesia from outside are the 
negative impacts of economic globalization and the penetration 
of foreign cultures due to sophisticated technology and 
information systems. 
  Lemhanas Governor Mutoyib reported earlier that the Lemhanas 
course began on February 5 and would last until June 25. It is 
being attended by 95 participants, including 39 senior armed 
forces officers and officials from government departments, 
non-governmental agencies, and social organisations. 
  President Suharto told the course participants that it is 
the 
duty of a leader to change a challenge into an opportunity, a 
weakness into a strength and to explain to the people what is 
happening around them. 
  "The duty of a leader is difficult to carry out if the 
relevant parties do not provide support. Therefore, a leader 
must have a wide horizon and a mature personality" Suharto said.

  [Text] Bandung, June 23 (ANTARA) -- Indonesian 
telecommunication network PT [Company Limited] Telkom will allow 
PT NEC Nusantara Communications, a Japan-Indonesia joint venture 
company, to build a telephone exchange centre with a 1.5 million 
telephone line (SST) capacity. PT Telkom Operation Director 
Dadad Kustiwa told ANTARA here on Thursday that PT NEC Nusantara 
Communications was given the contract because it has long been 
successful in installing telecommunications facilities in 
various cities in Indonesia. 
  The installation of the 1.5 million line SST-switching 
centre 
is part of a target to install five million SSTs throughout 
Indonesia during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (Pelita 
VI). 
  PT NEC Nusantara Communications was established under a 
joint 
venture agreement between Japan's NEC multinational company and 
Indonesia's PT Elektrindo Nusantara and PT Humpuss, both private 
companies. 
  Data indicate that the Indonesia-Japan joint venture company 
has installed some 350,000 telephone lines so far. 
  The company is currently installing another 444,100 
telephone 
lines and is setting up a number of switching centres, each with 
a capacity of 40,000 telephone lines, in various cities in 
Indonesia. 
  The new contract, in addition to previous projects, brings 
the total number of telephone lines confirmed to be installed 
during Pelita VI to 2.3 million.

  [Text] Major cities in southern Philippines are bracing for 
renewed terrorist attacks in retaliation for the military 
offensive against the Abu Sayyaf extremists. 
  In General Santos City, Police Superintendent Renato Santos 
met with security agency owners yesterday to draw up plans to 
protect the city from terrorist raids. Santos said he would tap 
the vast army of private blue guards in security in securing 
private businesses in the city. Santos said intelligence 
reports confirmed that the Abu Sayyaf terrorists plan to carry 
out new bombings and kidnappings of prominent ethnic businessmen 
in General Santos City and South Cotabato. 
  He said the fierce fighting between advancing government 
troops and the extremists left six soldiers dead Tuesday, while 
15 others were wounded in the final assault to free a Catholic 
priest held hostage by the group. The priest, Father Cirilo 
Nacorda, is being held by the Abu Sayyaf for money. Soriano 
[name as heard] said the government assault has the tacit 
approval of Moro National Liberation Front chief Nur Misuari.

  [Text] The Philippine Navy has just acquired some new 
vessels. Earlier today, President Ramos commissioned VRP [Vessel 
of the Republic of the Philippines] Dagupan City, another 
logistics support vessel donated by the United States, and four 
fast patrol crafts bought from South Korea. The commissioning 
coincided with the celebration of the 96th anniversary of the 
Navy. The president said that the time has come to replace the 
old vessels which date to World War II. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in English] I am happy that the Navy 
also has started to decommission ships that are no longer 
economical to operate, thus, improving the Navy's over-all 
efficiency. But as admirable as our efforts are to extend the 
life of even the old ships of the fleet, we can only go so far. 
We cannot escape the fact that we really need to upgrade our 
ships through new acquisitions and this I assure you we are 
trying our best to accomplish. [end of recording]

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- A meeting took place 
here today to mark the 21st anniversary of the publication of 
"Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country", a 
work of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The meeting was attended by Pak Song-chol, member of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party 
of Korea [WPK] and vice-president, Yang Hyong-sop, alternate 
member of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], 
WPK and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, and working 
people in the city. 
  On June 23, 1973, immediately after the South Korean rulers 
published a "special statement" announcing the creation of "two 
Koreas" as their "policy", President Kim Il-song put forth the 
five-point policy of national reunification as a revolutionary 
measure decisively to smash the permanent nation-splitting moves 
of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and open an epochal 
phase of national reunification. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song has said: 
  "Our proposal is to remove military confrontation and ease 
tension between the North and the South, bring about 
multilateral collaboration and interchange between the two 
parts, convene the great national congress composed of 
representatives of people of all levels and political parties 
and social organizations in the North and South, institute the 
North-South confederation under the single name of the 
Confederal Republic of Koryo and enter the UN under that name. 
When this proposal for the country's reunification is put into 
effect, there will be a great improvement in accomplishing the 
historic cause of peaceful national reunification on the 
principle of the North-South joint statement, as commonly 
desired by our people and the world's people." 
  In his report at the meeting Paek Nam-chun, director of the 
Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland, said the five-point policy of national 
reunification laid down by the great leader was a patriotic 
reunification formula most correctly reflecting the unanimous 
aspirations and will of all the fellow countrymen who desired a 
peaceful reunification of the country and opposed a permanent 
division of the nation, and an immortal militant banner which 
set forth a broad vista and way of national reunification and 
roused vigorously the entire people to the struggle to realize 
it. 
  "It is entirely because of the `two Koreas' policy of the 
United States and the successive South Korean authorities that 
the five-point policy of national reunification has not been 
implemented, though it evoked welcome and full support of the 
entire Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for its 
fair and reasonable nature," he said. 
  The reporter pointed out that in recent years the United 
States and its followers have been increasing the tensions on 
the Korean peninsula and creating graver obstacles in the way of 
Korea's reunification by inventing the "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK. 
  Recalling that the DPRK Government took a decisive measure 
of 
declaring its immediate withdrawal from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] in face of unjustifiable moves of the IAEA 
Secretariat, he said this is a legitimate self-defence measure 
and "an expression of our people's firm stand and will not to 
bow to any pressure." 
  It is not allowable to live in uneasiness, exposed to the 
danger of an unpredictable nuclear war on top of the tragedy of 
national division, the reporter said, and continued: 
  The United States must no longer seek "sanctions" against 
the 
DPRK but come out to the DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere 
attitude and stand for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue 
of the Korean peninsula, in compliance with the aspiration of 
the time and the demand of the Korean and U.S. peoples. 
  We believe that the visit to Pyongyang by a former U.S. 
President a few days ago will produce an affirmative result. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the hostile policy 
toward the DPRK they have pursued, motivated by a foolish 
intention to realise their old dream of "the greater east Asia 
coprosperity sphere." 
  They must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by 
their moves against the DPRK and the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), honestly apologize for 
all the crimes committed so far and punish the criminals. 
  "Sanctions" against the North are immediately sanctions 
against the South and a declaration of war to the 70 million 
Koreans. 
  The South Korean authorities must renounce the policy of 
dependence on outside forces, take the stand of national 
independence, give up the policy of confrontation between the 
fellow countrymen and seek national concord and unity. 
  It is our consistent position to meet with anyone who truly 
wants the independent and peaceful reunification of the country 
from the stand of great national unity and national independence 
and jointly seek the way of the peace and peaceful reunification 
of the country. 
  The premier of the DPRK Administration Council, thinking it 
lucky that the South Korean side expressed its readiness to hold 
top-level talks with the North, sent a message today upon 
authorization to the South Korean "prime minister," expressing 
welcome and agreement to the South side's proposal for holding a 
preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks. 
  I express support to it in the name of the participants in 
this meeting, considering that it reflects the consistent 
position and policy of our side to remove confrontation between 
North and South and open a new phase for national reunification 
independently and peacefully through top-level talks. 
  Paek Nam-chun called on all the Koreans at home and abroad 
to 
brilliantly adorn 1995 as the proud year of national 
reunification, the significant year marking the 50th anniversary 
of national liberation and the historical year that our nation 
set as the first year of reunification, under the banner of the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation.

<F P=106> ["Adventurous Arms Buildup"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the U.S. 
Senate adopted a resolution urging the reinforcement of the U.S. 
forces and fighter planes present in South Korea and the 
dispatch of an aircraft carrier combat unit around it. Earlier, 
the U.S. Defense Department declared that it would send 
reinforcements of mobile strike force to South Korea and its 
surroundings. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: The attempt of 
the hardline conservative forces in the United States to put 
military pressure on us, while hastening arms buildup, shows 
that they are not interested in a peaceful solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but intend to stifle the 
DPRK with "strength". 
  They are persistently working to carry the situation of the 
Korean peninsula to an extreme phase and putting pressure on 
those calling for a solution to the nuclear issue on the 
peninsula through dialogue and negotiation. 
  It is a unanimous demand of the world people to solve this 
issue through dialogue and negotiation. A military option 
cannot be a way of solving it. 
  If the way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogue and negotiation is blocked by the 
reckless military pressure campaign, the consequences will be 
unpredictable. 
  The U.S. hardline conservative forces must act with 
discretion, coolly looking into the reality.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
committed an aerial espionage on the DPRK by bringing an 
overseas-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane to the sky 
of South Korea on June 21, military sources said. 
  The provocative aerial espionage was part of their 
premeditated war preparations against the DPRK. 
  Meanwhile, overseas-based pursuit-assault planes, VTOL 
[vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes and early warning 
planes held a surprise bombing exercise in the skies above 
Yongwol, Pyongchang and Asan Bay in cooperation with scores of 
warplanes belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea. 
  On the same day, a formation of Pacific-based KC-135 tankers 
were deployed in a U.S. Air Force base in South Korea. 
  Facts prove the U.S. imperialists are persistently seeking 
confrontation and war, going against peace and detente.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Foreign news media 
reported news of the visit to the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
  Showing a scene of the great leader President Kim Il-song 
talking with Carter, Swedish TV June 16 stressed it is only 
President Kim Il-song, the great leader of the Korean people, 
who could have a decisive influence in solving the crisis 
created on the Korean peninsula surrounding the nuclear issue. 
  President Kim Il-song expressed optimism about the prospect 
of solving the crisis surrounding the Korean peninsula, the TV 
reported. 
  On the same day, Norwegian TV said only President Kim 
Il-song 
could indicate the way of solving the present crisis of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The Italian paper LA STAMPA spotlighted a picture the great 
leader had taken with Carter and said a heated atmosphere 
between Pyongyang and Washington was removed after President Kim 
Il-song received Carter for hours. 
  Noting that Carter described his Pyongyang visit as a 
fruitful visit which brought about an important progress, the 
paper said this was a good news for the United States when the 
U.S. plan of "sanctions" against North Korea virtually touched 
off strong reaction in the United Nations and Washington was in 
a difficult position. 
  XINHUA News Agency June 18 quoted Carter as telling 
President 
Kim Il-song that the United States has stopped its activity for 
"sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  The Danish Central Radio June 17 said Carter visited North 
Korea with a mission of solving the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Carter told that the United States would begin a new 
negotiation with North Korea and was ready to openly declare the 
non-use of nuclear weapons against North Korea, the radio said. 
  The Chinese PEOPLE'S DAILY June 20 quoted Carter as saying 
at 
a press conference in Seoul on June 18 that establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea 
will be useful in promoting understanding and exchange between 
the two countries. 
  Carter said if talks are held, they should shift from 
"sanctions" to the third-round talks and stop urging "sanctions" 
at the UN Security Council from this point of view, the U.S. 
Radio Voice of America reported June 20. 
  The radio also quoted Gallucci as saying he hopes the U.S. 
Administration will continue following the content of talks 
between Carter and President Kim Il-song at this point. 
  The Japanese NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN June 18 said the Clinton 
administration began to move toward full resumption of the 
U.S.-DPRK dialogue after President Kim Il-song received former 
President Carter twice. 
  The United States manifested its stance actually not to call 
in question the past "nuclear development issue" of North Korea 
but solve the issue between the two countries, excluding the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the paper wrote. 
  It can be said that the U.S. Administration took the hand 
held out by President Kim Il-song in the last moment without 
delay, added the paper.

  [Text] A news conference was held at the People's Cultural 
Palace yesterday [23 June] in connection with the South Korean 
authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons development. 
Participating in the news conference were reporters from the 
publication and media organizations in Pyongyang, such as NODONG 
SINMUN, the KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, the Korean Central 
Broadcasting Committee; foreign correspondents; and publication- 
related functionaries at various foreign embassies in our 
country. 
  At the news conference, Ho Hyok-pil, vice director of the 
Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland [CPRF], first of all, issued a memorandum of the 
CPRF exposing the truth that nuclear weapons development has 
been pushed for in South Korea. The memorandum pointed out that 
South Korea has accelerated nuclear weapons development in a 
planned way and systematically abrogated the joint declaration 
on denuclearization, while possessing reprocessing facilities, 
and extracting and bringing in plutonium in an illegal way. 
  The memorandum pointed out as follows that South Korea's 
post-irradiation test facilities [chosahu sihom sisol] are 
reprocessing facilities disguised as experimental ones: 
Although South Korea is disguising the post-irradiation test 
facilities in Taedok as peaceful atomic facilities, it can be 
confirmed by all data that they are reprocessing facilities. 
Above all, the post-irradiation test facilities have been built 
for reprocessing purposes. The post-irradiation test facilities 
are reprocessing facilities of extracting plutonium in terms of 
their structure and operational process. 
  South Korea is extracting plutonium directly from spent 
nuclear fuel by making use of post-irradiation test facilities. 
According to obtained data, the South Korean authorities 
extracted plutonium after taking 4 meter-long 2,148 nuclear fuel 
rods, 12 bundles, to the post-irradiation test facilities at the 
atomic research center from the Kori No. 1 Power Plant alone on 
24 May, 1985, in accordance with an agreement with the United 
States. 
  Nuclear material is being diverted in an undisguised way in 
South Korea. In cahoots with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], the South Korean authorities have systematically 
reprocessed, and extracted huge amount of plutonium every year 
from, spent nuclear fuels--which they did not burn completely 
at, and extracted from, the heavy-water reactor and 
multi-purpose research reactor--after taking those fuels to the 
post-irradiation test facilities. The total amount of it is 50 
kg according to the data-- which have been rudimentally 
obtained--alone. 
  The memorandum pointed out that South Korea is trying to 
legalize the introduction of plutonium from abroad and bring it 
in in large quantity. The memorandum pointed out as follows 
that the South Korean authorities have created artificial 
obstacles to the implementation of the joint declaration of the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which the North and 
South sides adopted and effectuated, reflecting the unanimous 
aspirations and wishes of all countrymen: The present South 
Korean authorities have launched maneuverings of abrogating the 
North-South joint declaration of denuclearization in a planned 
and systematic way. Meanwhile, they are even advocating the 
theory of nuclear sovereignty and that of counter-nuclear 
development [taeung haekgaebalnon]. 
  The South Korean authorities ought to scrap the 
post-irradiation test facilities--the reprocessing 
facilities--while making public the plutonium which they have 
illegally obtained. 
  We present--and strongly protest against--to the aboveboard 
public opinion of the world the fact that the IAEA is applying a 
double standard. 
  He made remarks on the issuance of the memorandum. He said 
that the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution on 
10 June for discontinuing the agency's cooperation with our 
Republic, adding that this is a wanton infringement upon our 
Republic's sovereignty, an unfair act, and an integrated 
expression of the agency's application of a double standard. 
  He pointed out that those who have pushed for nuclear 
armament [haekmujanghwa] on the Korean Peninsula are the South 
Korean authorities. 
  He laid bare that the post-irradiation test facilities in 
the 
Taedok Complex in South Korea are extracting plutonium from 
those facilities, while saying that they are the reprocessing 
facilities of extracting plutonium in a thorough-going way in 
view of the purpose of their introduction, structure, and of the 
process of realistic diversion. 
  He also pointed out that South Korea has illegally brought 
in 
huge amount of plutonium from abroad, exposing that it is 
applying spurs to the development of a fast-breeder reactor 
today to make its introduction of plutonium legal. 
  He stressed: Nonetheless, the IAEA has never taken issue 
with this. We bring a charge against the agency's unjustness to 
the public opinion of the world. 
  At the news conference, Vice Director Ho Hyok-pil and (Paek 
Hyon-su), a responsible researcher for the fatherland's 
reunification, answered the questions raised by reporters. 
  They said that South Korea, which is said to undergo the 
IAEA's inspections, is extracting plutonium through the 
post-irradiation test facilities, adding: The IAEA has conducted 
more than 2,000 cases of inspections on the average every year 
since the Nonnuclear Proliferation Treaty took effect. This 
notwithstanding, the agency has never exposed even a single case 
of the nuclear materials being used for military purposes. 
  They said: In particular, the IAEA has conducted nuclear 
inspections of South Korea. But, it has turned its face away 
from South Korea's nuclear weapons development and even from its 
introduction of nuclear raw materials [haek wollyo]. 
  They stressed: The South Korean authorities have 
intentionally publicized to the public that all of their 
attempts for nuclear weapons development up until now have been 
given up. This is nothing but a smoke screen to cover up their 
nuclear armament. 
  They disclosed: The world's social circles strongly call for 
exposing, and taking issue with, the maneuverings for nuclear 
armament in South Korea. Because even those inside South Korea 
have begun exposing the authorities' maneuverings for nuclear 
weapons development since last year, the South Korean 
authorities have been put in an awkward situation and have 
placed the public opinion under their sway in a deceitful way 
with a view to coping with this. 
  They pointed out in a concrete way: Because their 
development of a fast-breeder reactor has faced strong protests 
and denunciations at home and abroad, the South Korean 
authorities are trying to bring in plutonium by any means 
[kioko] under the pretext of developing an improved light-water 
reactor; and have invited an agency team for inspections and 
safety examination to cover up their relations of conspiracy 
with the IAEA and to continue to apply spurs to their nuclear 
armament behind the scenes of conspiracy. 
  In conclusion, they said emphatically: It is necessary to 
raise the voice of justice, on a worldwide scale, of denouncing 
the South Korean authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons 
development.

<F P=106> ["War Hysterics Carried Into Extremes" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam called together "directors of non-economic ministries 
and agencies of the `government'" at "Chongwadae" on June 20 and 
told them that "strength must be built up, if peace is to be 
maintained," according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  On the same day, the traitor Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the 
"Democratic Liberal Party" of South Korea, showed up at a puppet 
army unit in the frontline area and cried "the alert posture 
must not be slackened a moment". And he let loose a bellicose 
blast, driveling "if a war broke out again, I will fight on the 
front even as a private second class." 
  This fully shows that the war hysterics of the Kim Yong-sam 
group has been carried into extremes. It is now running about 
like a headless fly to provoke a new war, taking issue with the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  The outpouring of the traitor Kim Yong-sam fully revealed 
his 
criminal intrigue to contain the North with armed forces in 
reliance on outside forces. And the traitor Kim Chong-pil's 
outcry that "he would fight on the front" is a harebrained folly 
of a special-class bellicose element who has gone off into war 
hysterics, itching to provoke a war against the North. 
  The traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique are precipitating their 
own destruction by persistently resorting to the criminal moves 
to do harm to the fellow countrymen and plunge the nation into a 
holocaust of a nuclear war in league with outside forces, 
peddling the "doctrine of inevitability of sanctions against the 
North".

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Kim Kyong-hun, 32, and 
Kim Yun-il, 28, who had been kidnapped by South Korean puppets 
while engaging in felling in the far eastern region of Russia 
and escaped, met with reporters here on Monday and threw a 
revealing light on the truth behind the despicable kidnapping 
campaign of the South Korean puppets against lumbermen of the 
DPRK. 
  They were working at the forestry station No. 2 under the 
first complex of the Far Eastern Forestry Mission in Elga, 
Khabarovsk. 
  They first explained how they were kidnapped by agents of 
the 
South Korean "Security Planning Board [SPB]", 
  On May 8, 1992, they went shopping to the Birobidzhan market 
and got on a train after a Russian merchant who promised them to 
buy things they needed in Novosibirsk. 
  When they were ended up in embarrassment, having lost money 
and goods while traveling in the train, a man dressed like a 
Chinese volunteered to help them as a compatriot and led them to 
Moscow. Upon arriving in Moscow, they got on a taxi, which took 
them directly to the South Korean "embassy". The Russian 
merchant and Korean who kidnapped them were members of the 
"Association of Koreans" in Moscow. 
  The "Association of Koreans" was an anti-DPRK plot-breeding 
group on the payroll of the South Korean puppet embassy. 
  South Korean "SPB" men including Choe Chon-yop, first 
secretary of the "embassy", tried to force them to admit that 
they came to the South Korean "embassy" of their own accord, 
branding them as "criminals" who intruded into the "land of 
South Korea". 
  Later, they were held in detention in the office of Ho Chin, 
chairman of the "Association of Koreans" and general director of 
the newspaper LENIN KICHI, for one week before being taken to Yi 
Vadim, vice-chairman of the Rostov chapter of the "Association 
of Koreans". 
  In Rostov they underwent brainwashing under the watch of 
gangsters who tried to force them to write articles against the 
DPRK. The rogues also tried to make them write a letter to 
Yeltsin saying they could not live in North Korea and requesting 
him to grant them political asylum so they might live as 
citizens of Russia. 
  But they refused to do such things against the DPRK. When 
those lumbermen refused to comply with their demand, the "SPB" 
operatives and their underlings threatened them in every way. 
  One day in August, they threatened to kill the lumbermen, 
saying they would not be allowed to leave there alive. The 
lumbermen, unafraid of death, pounced upon them with a kitchen 
knife and an axe. 
  The villains who had been in a killing mood just moments 
before were struck with terror and ran away. The lumbermen fled 
and took shelter in the house of a man sympathetic with them. 
Later they escaped from the grip of the enemy with his help. 
  Kim Kyong-hun exposed the relations between the South Korean 
"embassy" and Ho Chin's "Association of Koreans" in Moscow and 
their kidnapping methods. 
  Choe Chon-yop, acting in the guise of a first secretary of 
the South Korean "embassy", is an operative of the "SPB" who 
directly wirepulls the "Association of Koreans". He personally 
questions kidnapped lumberjacks and decides on their fate. 
  He disguises those who are to be taken to South Korea as 
"political exiles" or "refugees" and sends those who are to be 
left in Russia back to the "Association of Koreans" and 
manipulates it to brainwash them and use them in anti-DPRK 
intrigues. 
  Kim Kyong-hun told reporters that through his own experience 
he learned that the "Security Planning Board" section in the 
South Korean "embassy" is a den of kidnappers of DPRK lumbermen 
in Russia, and the members of the kidnapping gang including the 
"Association of Koreans" are servants paid by the "SPB" for 
their criminal doings. 
  According to him, the South Korean "embassy" in Moscow does 
the dirty job in Europe and the "consulate-general" in 
Vladivostok in the far east. A certain Pak, deputy consul of 
the "consulate-general," is a high-ranking operative of the 
"SPB" under whose baton the chairman of the "Association of 
Koreans" in Nakhodka supervises operations of alluring and 
kidnapping DPRK lumbermen. 
  Kim Yun-il told reporters about the purpose sought by the 
"Association of Koreans" in trying to force him to write a 
letter to President Yeltsin. In this, the "SPB" of South Korea 
and the reactionaries of the "Association of Koreans" intended 
to disguise their illegal organisation as a "charity" 
organisation, he said. 
  Kim Kyong-hun and Kim Yun-il said if the South Korean 
puppets 
continued to frame plots against DPRK lumbermen in the far 
eastern region of Russia, distorting facts, they will eventually 
drink a bitter cup. 
  They urged the Russian authorities never to allow the South 
Korean puppets' kidnapping of DPRK lumbermen in the far eastern 
region, because it harms the traditional friendship between the 
Korean and Russian peoples and it is an international crime 
creating instability in the Russian territory.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The Institute of 
International Affairs of the DPRK issued Thursday a memorandum 
making public concrete facts about Japan's direct involvement in 
the last Korean war. 
  The memorandum was published at a time when the revived 
Japanese militarists are trying to take a military action 
against the Korean people, gravely jeopardizing peace and 
security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia. 
  The lengthy memorandum under the title "Japan was directly 
involved in the war of aggression against Korea" says Japan 
together with the United States prepared the war of aggression 
against Korea and served as a logistic base, supply base, repair 
base and attack base for the U.S. Forces during the Korean war 
and directly involved itself in germ warfare. 
  "The Japanese militarists directly participated in the war 
of 
aggression in Korea started by the U.S. imperialists in the 
1950s and committed a hostile military action against the Korean 
people, but this fact has remained a secret," the memorandum 
says, adding: "This is why we are opening the materials to the 
public." 
  Recalling that Japan participated in the U.S.-imposed Korean 
war in violation of international laws and its "peaceful" 
constitution and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and 
sufferings on the Korean people, the memorandum warns: "If the 
Japanese reactionaries expect `a shower of gold' again in `a 
second Korean war', it is a big mistake."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Frenzied Winds of Civilian </F>
Fascism Are Blowing"] 
  [Text] Strong winds of large-scale fascist suppression 
have been blowing in South Korea these days. This attracts 
people's attention. 
  Taking advantage of the inaugural ceremony of the Second 
National Federation of General Student Councils [Hanchongnyon], 
the South Korean fascist elements babbled [ununhamyo] this 
organization is beneficial to the enemy and frantically tried to 
arrest leading members of this organization by wielding the 
notorious National Security Law. On 18 June they dispatched the 
puppet police to five universities, including Hongik University 
of Seoul, and kicked up commotions for searches and arrests. 
  Also, on 20 June, they committed fascist violence by 
arresting approximately 270 university students and peasants who 
attended meetings and staged demonstrations at Yoido Plaza and 
near the Yongdungpo Station to oppose the National Assembly's 
ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement. In reporting on 
this, even South Korean broadcasting stations pointed out that 
this was the first time since the civilian regime was 
inaugurated that many people were detained en masses in a single 
day. 
  The South Korean fascist elements responded to the South 
Korean workers' struggle for the right to existence with a 
wholesale suppression. As reported, when the South Korean 
railroad workers demanded the basic right of existence, which 
includes wage hikes and the improvement of their working 
conditions, the South Korean fascist elements ran amok while 
convening a meeting of ministers in charge of public order and 
labor or releasing statements. They threatened to detain all 
workers if they go on strike. 
  People cannot but be appalled by such a bestial fascist 
suppression offensive never before seen, not even during the 
military dictatorships of the Fifth and Sixth Republics. We 
cannot but say this is a grave development of the situation. 
  An insidious political goal is no doubt hidden behind this 
reckless suppression offensive by the South Korean fascist 
elements. As everyone knows, Hanchongnyon, with which the South 
Korean rulers take issue, is the successor of the National 
Council of University Student Representatives and an independent 
and patriotic student organization that carries out only 
righteous activities for independence, democracy, and 
reunification and that enjoys enormous prestige among the South 
Korean people. An attempt to consider this progressive student 
organization to be hostile and suppress and obliterate it is an 
unjustifiable antidemocratic and antinational crime. Also, the 
struggle by the South Korean peasants and youth and students to 
prevent the National Assembly from ratifying the Uruguay Round 
agreement is a very just patriotic struggle that determines if 
they can protect the rice market, to which the destiny of the 6 
million peasants is linked. 
  Needless to say, the workers' struggle for the right of 
existence should not be suppressed. Nevertheless, the present 
South Korean rulers who call themselves civilian suppressed the 
struggle by the youth and students, workers, and peasants on a 
large scale. Why did they do so? This was because the South 
Korean rulers have a very insidious political ambition and 
vicious endeavor. In short, their suppression offensive is none 
other than a reactionary offensive only seen on the eve of a war. 
  As everybody knows, the South Korean rulers are recently 
running amok while talking about an international cooperation 
system or sanctions under the pretext of the suspicion of our 
nonexistent nuclear development. They are also frantically 
kicking up confrontation and war maneuvers to crush their fellow 
countrymen with outside force. 
  They are almost daily and frantically conducting the Rimpac 
exercise, an air, land, and sea joint military exercise, a civil 
defense exercise, and many other war exercises against us. They 
are also recklessly making bellicose remarks as military 
countermeasures and surprise strikes. A man called executive 
chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, while prowling about 
[ssadanimyo] frontline areas, made the very inciting remarks 
that he would fight on battlefields even as a private second 
class if a war breaks out. 
  The South Korean fascist elements are so bestially 
suppressing the righteous popular struggle by the youth and 
students, workers, and people. This is no doubt an all-out 
reactionary offensive to achieve internal stability in 
preparations against war. 
  However, any suppressive offensive by the South Korean 
rulers 
will not be able to stifle the South Korean people's struggle 
spirits. Rather, the further they will strengthen their 
suppression, the more vigorously the workers, peasants, and 
youth and students will wage their righteous struggle. The 
South Korean rulers must clearly know that their fascist 
suppressive offensive will only hasten their destruction and act 
with discretion.

for Democracy and Reunification in South Korea issued a 
statement denouncing the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique's 
suppression of the South Korean Federation of General Student 
Councils (Hanchongnyon), a South Korean newspaper reported. 
  The statement said the suppression of Hanchongnyon angers 
the 
people as it is an anti-national act. 
  The inaugural ceremony of the second-term Hanchongnyon as a 
reasonable independent mass organisation was a very legitimate 
meeting, said the statement, adding that the invocation of the 
"National Security Law" charging Hanchongnyon with the "tendency 
toward benefiting the enemy" is an open suppression to stifle 
Hanchongnyon.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Authorities Must Immediately Stop </F>
Distributing Despicable Decoy Materials" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities are these days resorting to such a despicable act as 
distributing decoy materials full of falsehood and fabrications 
to officials of the DPRK working abroad and progressive figures 
of different countries. 
  This despicable disinformation campaign is part of their 
persistent anti-DPRK intrigues. 
  Their decoy materials such as letters, publications and 
video 
cassettes are, without exception, run through with sheer lies 
groundlessly vilifying the DPRK. 
  They send such propaganda materials in the name of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) or 
Koreans in Japan or even the International Institute of the 
Chuche Idea [IIJI]. 
  This is an intolerable insult to and mockery of Chongnyon 
and 
Koreans in Japan and the IIJI. 
  It goes without saying that the disinformation campaign is a 
brainchild of the notorious South Korean "Security Planning 
Board" [SPB], an anti-DPRK plot-breeding machine accustomed to 
telling lies and fabricating things. 
  The "SPB" recently launched into such dastardly campaign 
with 
the sinister political aim of creating ideological confusion 
among officials of the DPRK and progressive figures of different 
countries by taking advantage of the situation complicated by 
the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  The South Korean authorities stoop to any infamy in their 
efforts to create ideological confusion within the DPRK and take 
the edge off the international movement for solidarity with the 
Korean people's cause of justice growing stronger with every 
passing day, while running amok in their preparations to unleash 
another war and stifle the DPRK with the help of outside forces. 
But, by doing so they are stripping themselves fully naked as 
sycophant traitors. 
  It is a gross mistake, if they think they can give rise to 
any slightest ideological vacillation among officials of the 
DPRK and world's progressive people with such dirty tricks. 
  It is as foolish an act as trying to destroy a rock with an 
egg. 
  The South Korean authorities must immediately stop the 
despicable act of distributing decoy materials that can convince 
no one.

<F P=106> ["Challenge to DPRK and Chongnyon"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The minister of justice 
and the general director of the public security investigation 
agency of Japan on June 21 prattled that "most perfect measures" 
must be taken for watching and investigating the movements of 
the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon). Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this 
as a revellation of the Japanese authorities' attempt to further 
expand and intensify the crackdown on Chongnyon and a vicious 
challenge to the DPRK and Chongnyon. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Japanese authorities are assuming the legal and moral 
responsibility for ensuring the activities of Chongnyon, a 
patriotic and legitimate overseas citizens' organisation of the 
DPRK, and the democratic and national rights of the Koreans in 
Japan. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities' crackdown on 
Chongnyon, timing to coincide with the moves of the imperialists 
and reactionaries to stifle the DPRK on the plea of "nuclear 
suspicion", is part of their hostile policy toward the DPRK and 
a deliberate and premeditated political suppression to threaten 
Chongnyon, interrupt its patriotic activities and furthermore, 
remove it. 
  The Korean people and the compatriots in Japan value the 
dignity and sovereignty of the nation and will never pardon 
those who encroach upon it. 
  The Japanese authorities must stop the suppression of 
Chongnyon at once, mindful that they will be to blame for the 
consequences of their undisguised crackdown on Chongnyon and 
moves to stifle the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Rallies have been 
continuously held in different places of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea to denounce the Japanese reactionaries' 
suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan. 
  Speakers said at the mass rallies held in Nampo and Wonsan 
on 
June 20 and 21 that the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon moves of the 
Japanese reactionaries have become all the more heinous of late. 
They expressed towering anger and resentment at the Japanese 
reactionaries' unjustifiable criminal suppression of Chongnyon, 
an authoritative organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, 
and Koreans in Japan. 
  Noting that there is neither reason nor ground for the 
Japanese authorities to take Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as 
an object of suppression, they stressed that the Japanese 
authorities should protect and treat preferentially the Koreans 
in Japan who were forcibly taken to Japan by the Japanese 
imperialists and forced to hard toil in the past, and their 
descendants, and Chongnyon, an organization of overseas citizens 
of the DPRK which is conducting righteous activities to defend 
the democratic national rights of the Koreans in Japan and to 
promote friendship with the Japanese people. 
  Saying they could not remain an on-looker to the criminal 
deeds of the Japanese reactionaries who have become all the more 
undisguised in their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in 
Japan and hostile to the DPRK, working hand in glove with the 
United States and the South Korean puppets, they strongly 
demanded the Japanese authorities immediately stop the 
anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and severely punish the chief 
culprits in the recent cases. 
  They warned that the Japanese authorities should know 
clearly 
that it is foolish act of throttling themselves to antagonize 
the DPRK with a clamor for "sanctions" against the DPRK and 
suppress the Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.

<F P=106> ["Sinister Intention To Suppress Chongnyon"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Minister 
of Justice, Hiroshi Nakai, at a meeting on June 21 issued "an 
order" to keep a closer watch on the movements of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), saying 
"this is demanded by the situation" surrounding the "nuclear 
issue" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, according 
to a media report from Tokyo. 
  Shigetaki Ogata, general director of the public security 
investigation agency, told the meeting "it is necessary to take 
more perfect measures for the investigation into the movements 
of Chongnyon than ever before." 
  Their remarks fully revealed the criminal intention of the 
Japanese reactionaries to intensify the on-going suppression of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan on a wholesale scale under the 
command of the authorities. 
  The Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon, an 
authoritative organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and 
Japan-resident Koreans is the worst violation of human rights, 
an illegal political crackdown and a typical model of the 
national chauvinist crimes. 
  The Korean people can hardly repress bitter national 
resentment at Japan, which occupied Korea for nearly half a 
century and imposed immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings on 
the Korean people and is now continuing to persecute those taken 
to Japan forcibly from Korea and their descendants, instead of 
repenting of its past crimes through generations. 
  It is only too clear that the suppression of Chongnyon and 
Koreans in Japan is part of the premeditated and deliberate 
anti- DPRK moves launched by the Japanese authorities, availing 
themselves of the U.S. scheme to isolate and stifle the DPRK 
under the pretext of its "nuclear issue." 
  Such a wholesale suppression and the preparation of 
legislative arrangements for the establishment of a wartime 
system such as the "emergency security law" in Japan, which is 
designed to stage a comeback to Korea, indicate that "sanctions" 
against the DPRK by the Japanese reactionaries have reached a 
practical stage. 
  If they dare take "sanctions" against the DPRK, ignoring our 
repeated warnings, they will meet a severe punishment. 
  They must clearly see our determination and promptly stop 
the 
suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The General Association 
of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) is conducting 
activities to check the Japanese reactionaries' suppression. 
  A meeting of activists of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters 
of Chongnyon was held at the Korean Hall in Kyoto on June 18. 
  The meeting made a mid-term review of the struggle of the 
Chongnyon officials and compatriots to frustrate the Japanese 
reactionaries' suppression of Chongnyon and discussed measures 
to invigorate the patriotic work of Chongnyon on the basis of 
the achievements and experience of the "three-month movement for 
defending the rights of compatriots." 
  Chongnyon officials visited political parties of Japan and 
the metropolitan office in a request campaign. 
  The delegates including Pae Pyong-tu, chairman of the Tokyo 
metropolitan headquarters of Chongnyon, together with Yoshio 
Udagawa, chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assemblymen's League 
for the Promotion of Japan-Korea Friendship, visited the 
metropolitan office and handed to it a letter signed by 120,000 
Koreans in Japan in demand of the improvement of the treatment 
of Korean schools. 
  Kim Song-nak, vice-chairman of the Kyoto prefectural 
headquarters of Chongnyon, and delegates of compatriots under 
the headquarters met with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the 
Japan Social-Democratic Party and member of the House of 
Councillors, at the central headquarters of the party on June 16 
and requested the party to actively support the struggle of the 
officials and Koreans for defending Chongnyon and take proper 
measures lest violence against students of Korean schools should 
recur. 
  That day, the delegates also visited dietmen from the Komei 
Party, the New Party Sakigake and other political parties within 
the framework of a request campaign. On June 15, they met with 
Masanori Koto, deputy secretary general of the Japan 
Social-Democratic Party and member of the house of 
representatives and concurrently head of the joint fact-finding 
group on the search of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of 
Chongnyon, which is composed of the central headquarters and the 
Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the party.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Authorities Must Not Run Riot"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
authorities must ponder over the grave consequences to be 
entailed by their moves against the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea and the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon). Otherwise, they will meet a severe 
punishment. NODONG SINMUN serves this warning today. 
  The analyst says: 
  The Japanese minister of justice and general director of the 
public security investigation agency revealed the intention of 
the Japanese reactionaries to intensify the anti-Chongnyon 
campaign when they cried on June 21 for a closer watch on 
Chongnyon and investigation into its activities. 
  The Japanese authorities' anti-Chongnyon campaign which is 
assuming ever more serious dimensions is part of their moves to 
stifle the DPRK. It is a deliberate and premeditated political 
suppression motivated by a sinister intention to threaten 
Chongnyon, obstruct its patriotic activities and, further, 
destroy it. 
  Chongnyon, a lawful organization of overseas Koreans of the 
DPRK, has neither ignored and violated the Japanese law nor 
interfered in the internal affairs of Japan. Nevertheless, the 
Japanese authorities have committed a string of fascist outrages 
unprecedented since the formation of Chongnyon. And they are 
now crying for an open surveillance over Chongnyon and 
investigation into its activities. This is clear proof that 
their anti-Chongnyon moves have reached a very reckless stage. 
  What cannot be overlooked is that their indiscreet 
anti-Chongnyon moves are timed to coincide with the scheme of 
the imperialist reactionaries to stifle the DPRK under the 
pretext of the "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK. 
  Our people and compatriots in Japan hold the sovereignty and 
dignity of the country dearer than their lives and they will 
never pardon those who encroach upon them. The Japanese 
authorities must know that it is not favorable to them to join 
the international reactionaries in their scheme to stifle the 
DPRK and intensify the suppression of Chongnyon.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
Japanese minister of justice issued an "order" to keep a closer 
watch on the movements of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), saying "this is demanded by the 
situation". And the general director of the public security 
investigation agency cried that "it is necessary to take more 
perfect measures for investigation into the movements of 
Chongnyon than ever before". 
  In this connection, Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the 
Central 
Standing Committee of Chongnyon, issued a statement on June 21. 
  Pointing out that this revealed the undisguised intention of 
the Japanese Government authorities to antagonize the DPRK and 
suppress and control Chongnyon at any cost, under the pretext of 
the fictitious "suspected nuclear development", Paek Han-ki said: 
  "Such anachronistic words rolled off their tongues freely at 
a time when efforts are being made to solve the nuclear issue 
and ease the tensions on the Korean peninsula through dialogue 
between the DPRK and the USA. This is intended to aggravate the 
tension, going against the situation, and is an intolerable 
hostile act toward the Korean people and Chongnyon. 
  "The Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon sternly 
protests 
and denounces with bitter national indignation the hostile 
policy of the Japanese Government authorities to suppress and 
control Chongnyon at whatever cost. 
  "We strongly demand that the Japanese Government 
authorities, 
particularly the public security authorities, immediately 
withdraw the "instructions" and stop the hostile policy toward 
the DPRK and the suppressive policy against Chongnyon."

  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (KNS-KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) issued a statement June 20 denouncing 
the Japanese police's criminal search of the Osaka and Kyoto 
prefectural organisations of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) as an intolerable insult to and 
an unpardonable provocation against the 70 million Koreans. 
  The statement warned that if the Japanese Government 
authorities, far from showing a sincere repentance and making 
compensation for the past war of aggression and colonial rule, 
continue suppressing Korean nationals, they will face a stern 
judgement by the 70 million Koreans in the North and South and 
overseas. 
  The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon denounces the 
high-handed suppression by the Japanese Government authorities 
and demands a proper apology and compensation, the statement 
stressed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Dragomir Draskovic, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Communists 
League-Movement for Yugoslavia, when he received the DPRK 
ambassador on June 13, extended full support and firm solidarity 
to the principled stand of the DPRK toward the nuclear issue of 
the Korean peninsula. 
  Otete Gaston Mboyo, national chairman and secretary general 
of the National Movement of the Genuine Lumumbist Combatants of 
Zaire in a statement on June 15 said that the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula can never be solved by means of pressure or 
"sanctions" and it can be solved only by a sincere resumption of 
the DPRK-U.S. talks. "Victory is on the side of the Korean 
people who defend justice", he stated. 
  Man Mohan Adhikari, president of the Central Committee of 
the 
Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist), when he 
received the DPRK ambassador on June 14, said the DPRK's 
position that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should 
be solved in a peaceful way through talks with the United 
States, is entirely just. "Our party will, in the future, too, 
actively support the struggle of the Korean people," he declared. 
  The Central Executive Committee of the National Council of 
the Communist Party of India in a statement on June 4 strongly 
appealed to all peaceloving people of India to frustrate the 
U.S. plots against the DPRK and express firm support to and 
solidarity with the Korean people in their cause of justice.

  [Text] Moscow, June 20 (KCNA) -- A hearing on the nuclear 
issue of the Korean peninsula was held at the International 
Affairs Committee of the State Duma of Russia on June 20. 
  Present there were Chairman of the committee Vladimir Lukin, 
deputies to the State Duma who are members of the committee, 
Director of the Institute of the Far East of the Academy of 
Sciences of Russia Mikhail Titarenko, officials concerned and 
men of the press. 
  DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil, addressing the 
hearing, said that the Russian media reports on the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula were almost distorted reports much 
inclined to U.S. and Western reports. He explained the cause of 
the origin of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and the 
consistent stand and efforts of the DPRK for its solution. 
  Noting that the issue owed its origin to the massive 
shipment 
of the U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons into South Korea, he 
said that the United States invented the pretext of "suspicion 
of nuclear arms development" for the purpose of maintaining its 
domination over the Asia-Pacific region by keeping its forces 
and nuclear weapons in South Korea. 
  Stressing that the DPRK joined the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, not 
to be exposed to nuclear threat and pressure, he denounced the 
United States and its followers that are misleading public 
opinion with the allegation that the DPRK's withdrawal from the 
treaty is destroying the system, while shifting the blame for it 
onto the DPRK, and are continuously scheming to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK, crying for "sanctions". 
  He said that the "resolution" of the Board of Governors of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency is a prelude to the UN 
"sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  "We are always ready for dialogue and negotiation for a 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but can 
never accept threat or `sanctions' against us. If pressure is 
put on us, we will take a strong countermeasure," he declared. 
  Son Song-pil answered questions put by deputies to the State 
Duma and officials concerned with the Korean question. 
  Answering a question about the international meeting on the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula proposed by Russia, he 
said: "With the DPRK-U.S. talks brought to a rupture, we 
consider the meeting to be a way for a peaceful solution to the 
nuclear issue, if it is held on an equal and fair principle and 
when a concrete plan is proposed, we will study it." 
  "But," he added, "we cannot approve the notion of holding an 
international meeting while taking `sanctions' against us. 
Dialogue and `sanctions' are incompatible. We will take a 
countermeasure corresponding to the scale of the `sanctions' 
  "Our stand is to answer dialogue with dialogue, war with 
war."

  He expressed the belief that the DPRK would successfully 
surmount all the difficulties under the wise leadership of his 
excellency the great President Kim Il-song and the respected 
leader His Excellency Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] gave a reception Tuesday 
for a delegation of the Bangladesh National Socialist Party 
[BNSP] led by General Secretary Hasanul Huq Inu on a visit to 
Korea. 
  Speaking at the reception, Secretary of the WPK Central 
Committee Hwang Chang-yop said the Bangladesh National Socialist 
Party has vigorously striven to accomplish the cause of the 
working masses for independence, the cause of socialism since 
its foundation and grown to be a political force enjoying trust 
of the people in this course. "We highly estimate and support 
your party which is invariably defending the socialist banner 
and actively struggling for peace in Asia and the rest of the 
world even under the difficult situation in which vicious moves 
of the imperialists and reactionaries are going on unabated," he 
noted. 
  Saying to struggle in unity to defend and advance the cause 
of socialism in the present period is a common honorable duty 
devolved on the progressive parties of all the countries by 
history and the people, he stressed: "The WPK will in the 
future, too, make positive efforts to strengthen and develop the 
bonds of friendship, unity and solidarity with the Bangladesh 
National Socialist Party." 
  General Secretary Hasanul Huq Inu in his speech said that 
though the relations between the WPK and the BNSP were 
established not long ago, these relations are becoming closer 
for the commonness of their aim, idea and ideology. He affirmed 
that the Bangladesh National Socialist Party would always stand 
on the side of the Korean people. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il are making sincere efforts to realize the 
reunification and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, he 
said, adding: 
  "We will express solidarity for the struggle of the Korean 
people in the future, too."

of Costa Rica adopted a special resolution titled "Solidarity

denuclearising the Korean peninsula and expressing solidarity 
with the Workers' Party of Korea, the DPRK Government and people 
in the struggle against the new war provocation moves of the 
United States and the South Korean puppets. 
  Pressure from the imperialist powers such as "sanctions" 
against the DPRK is a blasting fuse which may cause a war on the 
Korean peninsula and spread its flames worldwide, said the 
resolution, denouncing the United States and other imperialist 
powers for monopolizing nuclear weapons and using them as a 
means of threat and blackmail against other countries.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song gave on-the-spot guidance to the Taesong 
District cooperative farm in Pyongyang municipality on June 21. 
  He was accompanied by Kang Song-san, premier of the 
Administration Council; So Kwan-hui, secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea; Kim Won-chin, chairman 
of the State Agricultural Commission; and officials concerned. 
  Going round the fields of the farm, President Kim Il-song 
acquainted himself with the farming and set forth tasks for 
manuring and cultivating crops on a scientific and technological 
basis for the present. 
  Saying what is most important in manuring and cultivating 
crops under the present condition of a long spell of drought is 
to sufficiently water the fields, he gave instructions that all 
the farms should adjust and reinforce the existing irrigation 
setups and make an effective use of them in an extensive 
irrigation of dry fields. 
  He said a high and stable harvest can be reaped, not 
affected 
by whatever long drought in the country where the irrigation of 
agriculture was completed long ago to bring into shape a 
powerful irrigation system. 
  President Kim Il-song said that in order to increase the 
crop 
yield, all the farm work including weeding and paddy water 
control must be done substantially as demanded by the chuche 
method and supplementary fertilizers be applied to paddy and 
nonpaddy fields in larger quantities in addition to chemical 
fertilizers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party of 
Korea publishing house recently brought out the fifth volume of 
Part 1 -- Anti-Japanese Revolution of "With the Century", 
reminiscences of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The first four volumes of the reminiscences, already 
published, have been widely read among the people at home and 
abroad. Vol. 5 covers the historical period from May 1936 to 
March 1937 when an epochal upturn was brought about in the 
Korean people's glorious history of anti-Japanese revolutionary 
struggle. 
  Printed in the front part of it is a famous handwriting of 
President Kim Il-song saying it is the historical lesson from 
the hard-fought anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle that the 
destiny of the fatherland can be saved only by the united 
efforts of the whole nation. 
  Also edited in it are photographs showing military and 
political activities of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army 
(KPRA) conducted briskly in the latter half of the 1930s with 
the Mt. Paektu secret camp as a stronghold, pictures showing 
activities of anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters including 
Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist revolutionary 
fighter, photos illustrating revolutionary art and publications 
created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle, and other 
valuable materials. 
  The fifth volume consists of three chapters. 
  In this volume President Kim Il-song recalls with deep 
emotions that the KPRA created guerrilla bases of a new form in 
the Mt. Paektu area and conducted brisk military and political 
activities in reliance upon them and that the Korean communists 
vigorously pushed ahead with the work of building party 
organizations at home. 
  He also recounts his struggle to rally broad sections of 
masses around the anti-Japanese national united front under the 
banner of great national unity and to form a joint front of the 
Korean and the Chinese peoples and deepen militant unity and 
fraternity between them in the heat of the bloody struggle 
against Japanese imperialism, the common enemy. 
  The book records significant stories about the revolutionary 
traits of Army-civilian unity and unity between officers and men 
which were highly displayed among the KPRA and people in those 
days, and emotional recollection of the glorious traditions of 
the revolutionary literature and art and publications created 
then. 
  Particularly emotional are stories about the noble communist 
virtues of President Kim Il-song who showed deep loving care for 
and trust in anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who remained 
unfailingly loyal to the cause of national liberation and 
brought them up as fine revolutionaries.

<F P=106> ["Korean People's Heroic Struggle in Defence of Their </F>
National Dignity" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with a by-lined article entitled "Heroic Struggle of 
Our People in Defence of Dignity of Their Country". 
  The just-born People's Army and people of Korea could win 
over the world's reactionary Allied forces in the fatherland 
liberation war because they fought an all-people heroic 
struggle, only believing in the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese struggle and 
ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, and closely 
rallied behind him, the article says, and goes on: 
  The Korean people, above all, rose as one in the war of 
justice and fought valiantly in hearty response to the militant 
call of the party and the leader "Everything for victory in the 
war!" 
  It was their unfailing loyalty to the party and the leader 
and high patriotic zeal that made the Korean people rise as one 
for victory in the fatherland liberation war when a grave danger 
befell their country and nation due to the imperialist 
aggression. 
  The entire people took arms instead of hammer and sickle, 
pen 
and book and enthusiastically volunteered to the front with a 
resolve to fight it out to the last drop of their blood. 
  The officers and men of the People's Army defended every 
inch 
of the fatherland at the cost of their blood by displaying 
matchless mass heroism, upholding orders of the respected leader 
with their whole heart. 
  Many heroic soldiers including hero Yi Su-pok ensured 
victories in fierce battle with the enemy by dedicating 
themselves to silence the enemy's pillboxes and destroying tanks 
and warships. 
  All the people in the rear, workers, peasants, students, the 
old and the young, fought heroically for wartime production and 
aided the front, not yielding at all even under the barbarous 
bombings by the enemy, and creditably ensured victory in the 
war, overcoming all hardships and difficulties, united firmly as 
one. 
  In particular, in the enemy-held areas, people organized 
guerrillas, young people formed young guards, and children 
children's guards to fight against the U.S. imperialist 
aggressors. 
  The Korean people and People's Army could so fully display 
mass heroism and the spirit of patriotic devotion in the 
fatherland liberation war because they firmly believed that they 
would always emerge victorious when they fought as indicated by 
the leader, cherishing deep down in their hearts the justice of 
the line, strategy and tactics laid down by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il- song and the wiseness of his leadership. 
  The enormous significance of the fatherland liberation war 
lies in that it strikingly demonstrated the fact that the 
strength of a people united firmly behind their party and leader 
is inexhaustible and nothing can break it. 
  Now, the Korean people and People's Army are firmly united 
behind respected supreme commander General Kim Chong-il, an 
ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, ideologically 
and purposefully and In-moral obligation. 
  They will as ever firmly unite behind the party and the 
leader and wage an all-people heroic struggle, thus smashing 
whatever maneuvers of the imperialists and firmly defending and 
further glorifying the Korean-style socialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The May 18 large-scale 
stamp-forging plant of the Chollima steel complex in Korea has 
begun operation with its large material and roller processing 
facilities reinforced. This has put new muscles into the 
processing base. 
  Officials of the Ministry of Metal Industry and officials 
and 
workers of machine plants across the country supplied all the 
equipment needed by it including seven large roller klathes, ten 
horizontal and vertical heat treatment ovens and several 
overhead cranes including a 100-ton crane in a short period. 
  The workers of the large machine tool plant of the Yongsong 
Associated Machinery Bureau, the numerical control branch 
factory of the June 1 youth general electric appliances works, 
the Taean electric appliances plant of the Taean heavy machine 
complex and the October 5 general automation works showed a high 
level of science and technology of the chuche-based machine 
building industry. 
  The workers of the Chollima steel complex including the May 
18 large-scale stamp-forging plant undertook the manufacture of 
heat treatment ovens and cranes and assembly of equipment. 
  The operation of all the newly installed equipment is quite 
satisfactory. Now the 10,000-ton press will give fuller play to 
its might and the chuche character of the metal industry will be 
increased.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- Recently, Yun Chin-ok 
in Songnam-tong, Kim Chaek City, North Hamgyong Province in the 
northern area of Korea, received a 100th birthday table from the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Such a great honor was also granted some time ago to Mrs. Om 
in Okchon-ri, Kim Chaek City, Kim San-ok in Wonsan City, Kangwon 
Province, and Choe Kyong-ok in Pyongwon County, South Pyongan 
Province, on their 103rd, 101st and 100th birthdays. 
  The number of centenarians is ever increasing in Korea where 
the most ideal health policy centred on the popular masses is in 
force. 
  Entering this year, many folks greeted their 100th 
birthdays, 
among them Chong Chae-myong and Pak Yong-sun in Tokchon City, 
South Pyongan Province, Kim Chang-yong in Onchon County, South 
Pyongan Province, Kim Kyu-chul in Sonbong County, North Hamgyong 
Province, An Sang-o in Naknang district, Pyongyang, and Mrs. 
Kwon in Hoeyang County, Kangwon Province. 
  Deep, indeed, is the loving care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for 
them. 
  Regarding the increasing number of centenarians as a great 
pride of the country, he sent birthday tables to all of them and 
took various measures so that health care institutions 
throughout the country might look after their health with 
special care. 
  In recent years, gerontology departments have made their 
appearance in the hospitals of the provincial universities of 
medicine and all the macrobian people throughout the country 
have been registered again and their health checked up. The 
registered long-livers enjoy medical care at central hospitals, 
wherever they may live. 
  The state allots a large amount of fund to the recovery of 
their health. 
  To cite an example, in February, Yi Pong-hwa, 94, in 
Hyuam-tong, Sadong district, Pyongyang, had his pneumonia cured 
at the Red Cross General Hospital of Korea through a 50-day free 
medical treatment that costed the state money equivalent to the 
two-year wages of an ordinary worker. 
  The constant increase in the number of macrobian people in 
Korea is attributable to the popular policies of the Workers' 
Party of Korea and the DPRK Government, the rapid development of 
health services, effective use of many mineral springs, the 
systematic improvement of the people's living, the custom of 
respecting the old folks that prevails in the society.

<F P=106> [Article by Kunlachada Chaiphiphat: "Refusal to list arms </F>
puts Thailand in terror camp"] 
  [Text] Thailand is the only one of Asean's six 
member-nations that has failed to submit arms data to the UN 
Register of Conventional Arms in New York. 
  Like it or not, the country will remain on the list of 
`terrorist nations' included in the UN Secretary General's 
report to the 49th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) 
later this year unless the Thai Ministry of Defence, responsible 
for national arms procurement, adopts a new attitude towards 
military transparency. 
  Indonesia, possessor of Asean's largest military arsenal, 
has 
submitted its military data to the UN registry. Last year 
Thailand and Indonesia were listed along with Syria, Saudi 
Arabia and Jordan as arm buyers failing to respond to UNGA 
resolution 46/36 L, which calls for all members to give new arms 
data to the UN. 
  The resulting situation is especially absurd in light of the 
fact that Thailand is supposedly at the forefront of regional 
and international efforts to implement the UN's Agenda for 
Peace, which calls for the building of trust and confidence 
across the region in order to prevent or minimize conflict. 
  The military is adhering to the old myth that the details of 
arms procurement is a national secret. It continues to bury its 
head in the sand, ensuring the worsening of an already blemished 
international image, particularly damaged by the army's alleged 
support of the Khmer Rouge. 
  The UN Register of Conventional Arms is a simple but 
effective step towards building trust among the nations of the 
world, calling upon member countries to voluntarily provide data 
on the importing and exporting of seven types of offensive 
weapons, as well as general background information on national 
procurement and holdings policy. 
  In 1991, Thailand was one of 150 UN member nations to vote 
in 
support of UNGA resolution 46/36 L on transparency in armaments, 
which resulted in further resolutions to set up the register 
over the next two years. The resolutions were approved by 150 
members with no objections. Iraq and Cuba abstained. 
  Last year 80 countries, including Asean members Singapore, 
Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei, submitted their arms data 
for UN registration. 
  But there is little point in having the Asean Regional Forum 
discuss the noble goal of trust-building in accordance with the 
UN agenda for peace when a host country like Thailand fails to 
contribute to even this very basic and essentially harmless 
attempt at boosting trust. 
  Military spending in Southeast Asia is generally considered 
extraordinarily large for peace time, which makes the exchange 
of arms purchase information especially important to the nations 
of this region. 
  As acting regional leader, the country must show its 
sincerity in this respect instead of playing for time with the 
excuse that neighbours Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma have 
not done so. 
  These countries will be attending the Asean meeting in 
Bangkok in July. Despite being the host country, Thailand will 
have absolutely no authority to initiate discussions of military 
transparency, which will be a crucial topic at the meeting. 
  Thailand is no longer justified in claiming regional 
instability as an excuse for delaying arms data. With 
Indonesia's disclosure, all other Asean nations have fulfilled 
their commitment to the UN. In the age of proliferation, 
countries the world over face an equal threat. 
  At any rate, despite the army's confidence, the size of 
Thailand's military arsenal, or that of any Asean nation, is no 
secret. International arms dealers have been more than willing 
to publish sales figures as it promotes their products. 
  In the UN's 1992 report on arms procurement, circulated at 
the General Assembly's 48th session last year, it was revealed 
that Thailand had bought arms from Australia, China and United 
States without registering this with the international 
organization. 
  The UNGA resolution, unlike Security Council resolutions, is 
nonbinding, and is aimed in part at testing the cooperativeness 
of UN members. 
  While the resolution's April 30 deadline has passed, the 
UN's 
annual report on arms procurement does not come out until 
August, and there is a provision for late filers in the report's 
appendix. 
  Better for Thailand to be a latecomer than the black sheep 
of 
the world community.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "ARF approach to security can ensure regional </F>
peace"] 
  [Text] Asean has commendably recognized the need for 
security cooperation, and the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) which 
meets next month in Bangkok could give rise to a new security 
framework in the region. 
  The 18-member multinational framework is arguably Asean's 
most ambitious effort in its 27-year history to engage the major 
powers in a security dialogue. 
  No region in the world has used its dividend from the 
thawing 
of the Cold War more wisely than East Asia. According to the 
latest figures from the Economic and Social Commission in 
Asia-Pacific (Escap) in Bangkok, the region has just had another 
banner year. It grew more than six times faster than the global 
economy did in 1993. 
  Regional stability is founded on the emergence regionwide of 
a open market system; the recognition by all Asean countries of 
the need for regional peace to ensure the continuation of 
internal economic developments; and the capping of the Indochina 
crisis -- in no small degree through the efforts of Asean. 
<H5>  Economic gravity </H5>
  For the moment, the United States' withdrawal from some 
naval 
and air bases in the region may have generated some anxiety in 
Asean. But as Apec [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] makes it 
clear, America's centre of economic gravity has shifted from the 
Atlantic coast to the Pacific. 
  A testimony to the changing times is the constitution of the 
ARF's membership which is drawn from both sides of the Cold War 
divide -- the six Asean countries, the United States, Canada, 
Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, 
Papua New Guinea, China, Russia, Vietnam and Laos. 
  Considering that some of these countries were at war with 
each other not so long ago, their coming together in the ARF 
shows their commitment to global peace and prosperity. 
  But serious differences remain because of the long history 
of 
conflicts and rivalries in the region. 
  For one, the South China Sea issue may soon come to a boil. 
China is running out of oil resources close to home, at a time 
when its own energy needs are growing exponentially. The 
strategic sealanes passing through the Spratlys are so widely 
used -- increasingly also by China -- that a conflict there 
could be injurious to the entire Asia-Pacific community. 
  A viable way urgently needs to be found to allow Vietnam and 
China to cool down the temperature in the Spratlys -- which can 
then become congenial to confidence-building measures among all 
claimant countries. 
  Also, the dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines over 
Sabah is the most salient and serious intra-Asean territorial 
dispute. This contentious issue has often created serious 
tension and caused a deterioration in relations between Kuala 
Lumpur and Manila which adversely affected Asean regional 
cooperation. 
  To be effective, the ARF has to serve its members, keeping 
in 
mind that the primary purpose is preventive diplomacy -- to 
preserve regional peace and prevent disputes from escalating 
into armed conflicts. In all circumstances, one thing should be 
remembered: the ARF is not a forum of the likeminded, therefore 
a spirit of give and take will be crucial to building mutual 
trust and confidence. 
  A current phenomenon in the region is the drive by several 
Asean governments to build up and modernize their weapons 
inventories. The simplest reason for this is that the end of the 
Cold War has brought down prices for modern weaponry -- and some 
East Asian countries are simply taking the opportunity to grab 
some "fire-sale" bargains while they are available. 
  Asean needs to agree on whether an arms race is taking place 
in its midst -- and if it is, then the member countries through 
the ARF must consult on how to contain it. 
<H5>  Arms register </H5>
  Various proposals have been made by think-tanks. These 
include the creation of a Southeast Asian arms register, 
regional cooperation in arms purchases, exchange of intelligence 
data, observers at military exercises, transparency about 
military strength, more contacts between military officers and 
even the creation of an Asean peacekeeping centre. 
  Recently some of the confidence-building measures were 
implemented. Singapore was invited for the first time as an 
observer at the just concluded U.S.-Thai Cobra Gold war games. 
This invitation could eventually be extended to other ARF 
members. 
  It, however, should be borne in mind that Asean countries 
have varied approaches to security and it is necessary that, 
through the ARF, they define the appropriate extent of 
transparency expected regarding military strength in the region. 
  From dialogue, the ARF must move gradually to seek a 
consensus about developing the mechanisms to maintain peace and 
stability. Only then can the Asia-Pacific region be a safer 
region, as the ARF promotes trust, eases tensions and heads off 
confrontations.

  [Text] Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian 
received Hainan Provincial Deputy Governor Chen Suhou and his 
agricultural economic observation delegation from at Government 
House at 0900 on 20 June. The delegation is here at the 
invitation of the Hainanese Association of Thailand. Deputy 
Prime Minister Bunchu, who visited Hainan eight years ago, 
warmly welcomed Chen Suhou and his delegation. He hoped that 
the delegation will achieve complete success in its observation 
trip. 
  Bunchu said: I visited Hainan in 1986. Hainan was rather 
backward at that time. There have been a lot of changes in 
Hainan during recent years, however, such as in the energy, 
telecommunications, and comunications sectors. Regarding 
agriculture, Bunchu said that Hainan, like Thailand, is rich in 
agricultural resources. Agricultural development also needs 
good planning. He hoped that the delegation will visit 
agriculture processing plants and agricultural export-oriented 
businesses. Bunchu also said that the Thai Government will 
consider joint ventures if the delegation makes any offers. Chen 
Suhou extended his gratitude for the warm reception. 
  At the friendly atmosphere, Chief Delegate Chen Suhou said 
that investment conditions in Hainan had improved a lot. The 
Sanya Fenghuang International Airport will be opened to air 
traffic on 1 July. The expressway from Haikou to Sanya will be 
completely open at the end of the year. All this will 
facilitate economic cooperation between Hainan and Thailand. 
Hainan Province, which has 200 square li of sea area, has 
favorable conditions for aquaculture, tropical crops, mining, 
and tourism. Hainan is now developing large-scale industry. It 
also pays attention to marine, economic, tourism, and 
agricultural development. Thai businessmen are welcome to enter 
joint investment projects in Hainan. Also present at the 
meeting were Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Jin Guihua and vice 
chairmen of the Hainanese Association of Thailand, Feng Yude, Fu 
Zhisen, and Li Changchun.

  [Text] No plot exists, allegedly by two Pakistanis, to 
assassinate or otherwise harm the Nepalese crown prince, Police 
director-general Pratin Santipraphop said yesterday. 
  He said there was a misunderstanding that Shakil Ammad, who 
is in police custody, and Mohammad Javet, who initially eluded 
police, had plotted to harm Crown Prince Dipendra bin Brikram 
Shadey at the Asian Institute of Technology [AIT]. 
  Officers in charge of the case were told the two were 
engineers with a company in Thailand, he said. 
  The two men went to the institute to use its telephone to 
make an overseas call instead of making the call at their hotel 
which would charge them more, Pol Gen [police general] Pratin 
said. 
  When officials at the AIT asked to see their passports, the 
pair could not produce them because they had forgotten to bring 
them. They then escaped because they were afraid they would be 
questioned, he said. 
  The Nepalese Embassy has also denied the plot suggestion. 
  The crown prince attended a geography course at the 
institute. He begins his official visit to Thailand today and 
leaves on Monday. 
  In a related development, Pakistan on Wednesday branded 
allegations that two Pakistanis planned to attack Nepal's Crown 
Prince Dipendra during his visit to Bangkok, a "smear campaign," 
intended to sabotage Pakistan-Nepal relations. 
  "This has become a very serious smear campaign," Riaz 
Mahmud, 
Pakistan's Ambassador to Thailand, told AFP. "Definitely there 
was a motive of some kind involved." 
  Ambassador Mahmud said he believed that Thai police who were 
quoted in the BANGKOK POST on Tuesday as saying there had been 
"hard evidence" linking two men to a plot -- had been used by an 
"outside agency." 
  Pakistan and Nepal "are very close members in SARG (South 
Asian Regional Cooperation)," he said. "That may not be to 
everyone's liking," he said. 
  He told AFP the embassy was questioning both Special Branch 
officials and POST employees over the matter, adding: "We should 
have some answers in a few days." 
  Earlier on Wednesday, Kathmandu called the allegations 
"totally baseless and false." 
  Both Ammad and Javet have denied any wrongdoing. 
sed on Wednesday to comment by phone on the case. 
  The POST report which appeared in Tuesday's edition was 
based 
on an authoritative Special Branch report. Police have since 
reconfirmed that their investigations are continuing.

  [Text] A source at the Interior Ministry disclosed that 
intelligence officials at the joint Thai-Lao coordination center 
reported mysterious deaths among Hmong immigrants receiving 
treatment for drug addiction at Wat Tham Krabok in Saraburi 
Province. The deaths were recorded at an average of one every 
day, or at least five every week. Death was caused by strong 
vomiting as a result of herbal medicine taken by drug addicts to 
cure heroin addiction. The dead were then cremated inside the 
compound of the monastery. No proper records of the deaths were 
kept. 
  According to the report, the Interior Ministry, with 
cooperation from the European Community, or EC, will on 30 June 
dispatch a group of 323 Hmong and lowland Lao refugees back to 
Laos. The EC has cleared a site in Bokeo Province as a 
settlement area for the refugees, and will provide them with 
supplies for farming. The project is part of the UNHCR program 
of repatriation for the Hmong and lowland Lao refugees.

  [Text] The military has issued a "Defence White Paper" 
detailing its strategic policies and explaining why it needs a 
huge budget, an unprecedented move that precedes a forthcoming 
parliamentary debate on the national budget. 
  The document, prepared by the Defence Ministry and the 
Supreme Command headquarters, was presented yesterday to 
reporters and participants of a seminar organized by the 
National Defence College. 
  Addressing the seminar on the "Military Role in National 
Defence and Development", Supreme Commander Woranat Aphichari 
said information in the Defence White Paper was not new but it 
had not been publicized before. 
  "We have just never disclosed it before, which made people 
think soldiers lived in a closed society," Woranat told national 
security psychology students and journalists attending the 
seminar. 
  "The situation has changed. To foster the democratic system 
in which we have faith, it is time to publicize this kind of 
information. This will make people understand the military more, 
and support our role. Some people's lingering doubts about the 
military's role will also be cleared up," he said. 
  Another reason for disclosing information in the white paper 
is to show "our neighbours that we have nothing to hide, that 
every defence strategy is based on our non-aggression policy," 
Woranat added. 
  The White Paper is divided into four main topics -- 
International and Regional Security, Basic National Strategy, 
Defence Strategy and the Thai Military in the Future. 
  In the section on international and regional security, the 
military expresses concern over the nuclear tension on the 
Korean Peninsula and the Spratly Islands conflicts involving 
China, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia. 
  The paper says the United States will continue to play an 
active military and political role to maintain peace in the 
region. 
  It mentions India's "increasing military capacity", covering 
possession of nuclear weaponry, effective air logistics and 
transport, and a formidable navy. The paper says India's naval 
strength has caught up with that of China. 
  The document also predicts that neighbouring Burma, with 
support from Beijing, will soon have a highly efficient 
military. According to the paper, Burma now has more than 
300,000 soldiers and has been procuring tanks, artillery and 
rocket launchers. The Burmese navy is also embarking on an 
expansion programme to protect oil and gas exploration. 
  The section on basic national strategy mentions attempts to 
improve Thai politics, "which needs to be carried out sincerely". 
  The third section says Thailand needs a sophisticated air 
defence, covering surveillance, patrol, intelligence and alarm 
systems. 
  In the section on future facing the Thai armed forces, the 
document says that to defend the country's borders, "enormous 
manpower and budget are required". 
  "We need to set up compact fast-moving teams with compact 
and 
effective weapons, to defend several major spots at the borders. 
Tanks and armoured vehicles must be efficient and suited to the 
frontier geography," it says. 
  The 1995 national budget allocates Bt131 billion for 
national 
defence and security, a five per cent increase on fiscal 1994. 
  Woranat told the seminar that the country's defence budget 
for the next fiscal year had been trimmed by about Bt50 billion. 
  The paper says Thailand's defence budget is relatively small 
compared with other ASEAN countries. 
  "We have to explain our needs and programmes to the public. 
That is why we are disclosing this White Paper information," 
Woranat said. 
  He added, however, that the military was satisfied with the 
final figures in the Budget Bill, which is to be deliberated by 
Parliament early next month. 
  Parliament President Marut Bunnak said the bill could be 
listed for debate on July 6 and 7. 
  If the debate cannot be concluded within the dates set, an 
extra afternoon, on Friday, July 8, will be set aside for it. 
The proceedings will be televised live, he said. 
  Marut thought the bill would get the backing of the Phalang 
Tham Party and would get through the House, despite the 
coalition's internal problems.

  [Text] The government will take good care of economic 
development to ensure the stability and prevent bubble economic 
growth as happened six to seven years ago. Deputy Prime 
Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak says that at present the 
country's export sector has extended significantly. During the 
first five months of this year, Thai export increased by 20 
percent against 14 percent as predicted earlier. The deputy 
prime minister attributes the expansion in export sector to more 
agricultural exports during the period, especially rice and 
frozen shrimps. Some high-tech products such as computer parts 
and electronics have also enjoyed high export growth, especially 
to ASEAN market. 
  Mr. Suphachai says the government will be cautious about 
credit extension for the real estate sector and about the stock 
market. It will ensure that private investment will be 
diversified into all regions of the country. He says the 
government has set a balanced national budget so that the 
country's economy will not expand at an excessive rate.

<F P=106> [By Watchara Charunsantikun and Charuwan Loetwinyu] </F>
  [Text] The Court of Directors of the Bank of Thailand 
yesterday ruled against introducing special measures to tackle 
rising prices, even though the inflation rate in May rose to 5.1 
percent compared with the same month last year. 
  The central bank has set a target for inflation of 4.2 
percent in 1994. The first five months have already seen 
inflation rising by 4.8 percent compared with the end of last 
year. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he had ordered the 
authorities to closely monitor building material prices to 
prevent significant impact on overall inflation. 
  Siam Cement Co, the largest cement producer, has also been 
asked to hold prices to avoid raising the national inflation 
rate further. 
  Chuan said the situation was not worrisome and recent 
increases in interest rates ought to slow down excessive 
spending. 
  The Bank of Thailand earlier warned that commercial banks 
were extending excessive credit, especially for personal 
consumption. Banks' total credit extension grew 24.7 per cent in 
the first five months of this year compared with the same period 
last year. The target set for 1994 is 21 per cent. 
  Bank Governor Wichit Suphinit said there was no sign of a 
"bubble economy", a notion used for a high growth and overheated 
economy which collapses suddenly as witnessed with the recent 
economic trend in Japan. 
  Yet, he admitted that the economy has seen a big 
month-to-month jump in inflation by 1.1 percentage points in May 
and the second half of 1994 was likely to see higher domestic 
spending. 
  "The current weak monetary policy ought to be able to 
curtail 
inflation from rising too high. We are still at a deterrent 
state and there is no need to take tough action," he said. 
  Informed sources said the current higher inflation rate is 
caused by three factors. The first is a 48 percent attribution 
from supply shortages -- especially of raw materials used in the 
production of industrial goods -- of commodities such as cotton, 
timber, fruit and vegetables (due to drought). 
  The second, with a 40 percent weight, is what is described 
as 
the demand-pull factor, especially in services. 
  The cost-of-production factor is assessed to have 
contributed 
12 percent to the total weight of the current level of inflation. 
  However, concerns about a possible bubble economy continue 
among top central bank officials, according to sources, 
especially if domestic spending should keep on rising. This is 
caused by the 7-8 percent rise in the wages of blue collar 
workers and 20-30 per cent increase in the wages of white collar 
workers and of civil servants. High export growth has also 
contributed to higher spending. 
  Higher oil prices have also resulted in the current account 
deficit surpassing the 5.4 per cent target in relation to gross 
domestic product. It was 5.5 percent in the first five months. 
  Sources quoted Wichit as telling the central bank directors 
that Thailand's inflation rate is higher than Singapore and 
Malaysia but lower than Indonesia, South Korea and the 
Philippines. 
  Foreign Liabilities of banks in May also climbed by Bt 
[baht] 
31 billion over the previous month to Bt354 billion, or twice 
the amount at the end of 1993. Overseas loans have been used to 
support high domestic credit growth. 
  Phisit Li-atham, the central bank spokesman, disclosed that 
credit extended by foreign and local banks inclusive of offshore 
banking facility, grew a hefty 24.7 per cent in the first five 
months, but deposits grew only 14 per cent. As a result, the 
credit/deposit ratio reached a record high of 120.9 per cent. 
  He described the five-month economic performance as 
satisfactory although credit growth was three percentage points 
higher than the target and total outstanding credit edged closer 
to Bt3 trillion. 
  "We think that the credit system is still disciplined 
enough. 
We may have to closely monitor some institutions. With the 
capital adequacy floor rising from seven to 7.5 per cent now and 
to 8 per cent next year it should reduce the credit growth 
pressure on top of previous interest rate increases," said 
Phisit. 
  The public sector reported higher cash surpluses in May with 
the total for the first eight months of the current fiscal year 
reaching Bt8.9 billion, and possibly reaching another Bt50 
billion in the four remaining months of the fiscal year. 
  Budget revenue is up 14.7 percent during this period 
compared 
with the target increase of just 12 percent. Expenditure is up 
17.9 per cent which is close to the target. 
  "The expected budget surplus of Bt60 billion this fiscal 
year 
will help to ease the inflationary pressure," Phisit said. 
  The manufacturing index during this period grow at a slower 
pace in May to 10.5 per cent, with a private investment rate of 
9.7 percent.

  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit 
reported that a proposal had been made to the cabinet early last 
week to support the move taken by the Justice Ministry to 
establish a court to deal with cases concerning intellectual 
property rights [IPR] and international trade. This is because 
cases involving intellectual property requires the service of 
competent legal experts in order to promptly carry out 
examinations and produce court decisions. There are also a 
growing number of cases involving violations of intellectual 
property rights. The move taken by the Justice Ministry is 
considered necessary and timely to prepare for the economic and 
commercial expansion of the country. The draft bill on an 
intellectual property court will be discussed by the cabinet 
next week and then will be forwarded to parliament for 
deliberation.

  [Text] One of the sources of income for fishermen in the 
island district of Phu Quy, Binh Thuan Province, is to conduct 
fishing activities in the Truong Sa [Spratly] Archipelago area. 
  There are 450 fishing boats of all types on Phu Quy Island 
and local fishermen earn their income chiefly from deep-sea 
fishing and diving. In the beginning, fishermen did not want to 
go and fish in the Truong Sa Archipelago area for fear of poor 
catches and long trips and a lack of large boats. In early 
1993, a fisherman from Phu Quy Island stayed in Truong Sa for 
one and a half months and earned 150 million dong from shark 
fishing. Since then, the movement to fish in Truong Sa has 
developed quickly. A total of 94 fishing boats operated in 
Truong Sa in 1993 and fishermen caught 5.6 tonnes of shark fins, 
250 tonnes of shark flesh, and 180 tonnes of snapper flesh. 
Since early this year, as many as 150 fishing boats with 1,200 
crewmen aboard have conducted fishing activities in Truong Sa. 
Each trip brought about two tonnes of snapper and goby and an 
average profit of between three and five million dong. On some 
occasions, fishermen earned as much as nine million dong in 
profit per trip. 
  To encourage fishermen to operate in Truong Sa, Binh Thuan 
Province has adopted a policy under which fishermen who invest 
in the building of large boats having a 45 horsepower-capacity 
or more for deep-sea fishing activities, especially in the 
Truong Sa Archipelago area, will be exempted from taxes for one 
year. Fishermen will also receive the wholehearted assistance of 
the defenders on the island.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong 
received in Hanoi a Japanese Government delegation led by Mr. 
Shigekazu Sato, director in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, 
who is on a working visit to Vietnam. Following is our radio 
comment on the relations between Vietnam and Japan: 
  Over the pasts years, relations between Vietnam and Japan 
have developed rapidly. The turning point of the development 
was the visit to Japan by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in March 
1993. During this visit, the Japanese Government welcomed and 
highly valued Vietnam's policy for renovation. After the 
resumption of Japan's ODA [Overseas Development Aid] for Vietnam 
at the end of 1992, the Japanese Government promised to further 
strengthen and develop the economic, scientific, and 
technological cooperation with Vietnam to a level in conformity 
with the potentials of the two countries. This commitment has 
been implemented effectively, especially after the lifting of 
the U.S. embargo against Vietnam. 
  Since early this year, many high level government 
delegations 
and businessmen from both Japan and Vietnam exchanged working 
visits in each country to discuss effective measures to 
strengthen bilateral relations. Recently at the reception given 
to Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign 
Minister Kakizawa affirmed Japan's unswerving policy to 
cooperate with Vietnam. Also in this occasion, Japan voiced its 
support for Vietnam to take part in regional organizations 
including ASEAN, and for Vietnam's activities in the Asian 
Pacific region. 
  Economically, Japan is the biggest trade partner of Vietnam. 
The two way trade turnover in 1993 was nearly $1.3 billion. 
Japan is the fifth largest investor in Vietnam. At the press 
conference in Hanoi during his working visit to Vietnam, Mr. 
(Akira Mishio), chairman of the Joint Japan Vietnam Economic 
Committee, said that Japanese businessmen showed great interest 
in Vietnam. He said that 1994 was a year for Japan to invest in 
Vietnam. Japan's position will be changed when the 
Japan-invested project on cement factory in north Vietnam with a 
total capital of over $200 million is completed. 
  Nineteen ninety-four is also the year that Japanese 
Government has honored its commitment. On 28 January 1994, 
representatives from the Japanese Government and the Vietnamese 
Government signed exchanged notes and agreement on the Japanese 
ODA granted to Vietnam in the fiscal year 1993 with the total 
value of $426 million. A number of other agreements on the 
Japanese Government's assistance to the development in economy, 
education, and health care in some localities in Vietnam were 
also signed. 
  This time Mr. Shigekazu Sato and his party are in Vietnam to 
discuss with Vietnamese agencies concerned to promote economic 
cooperation between the two governments, especially the Japanese 
Government ODA in the form of loan to Vietnam.

<F P=106> [Portions recorded] </F>
  [Summary] After 25 days of work, the Ninth National 
Assembly's fifth session closed this afternoon. 
  Attending the closing session were "Do Muoi, general 
secretary of the party Central Committee; Le Duc Anh, president 
of state; Vo Van Kiet, prime minister; Vo Chi Cong, adviser to 
the party Central Committee; and many veteran cadres of our 
party and state." 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet delivered the opening speech. He 
said: 
  [Begin Vo Van Kiet recording] "The tasks to be carried out 
in 
the last six months of the year are very great. The report 
presented by the deputy prime minister at the opening session of 
the National Assembly pointed out six sorts of difficult 
problems that need concentrated efforts to resolve. I would 
like to further emphasize that, apart from the aim of attaining 
the various requirements for 1994, the implementation of various 
tasks in the last six months of 1994 will also have a great 
effect on the following year. The implementation of these tasks 
requires a great concentration of effort by the various sectors 
and echelons from the central down to grass-roots levels. In 
the period ahead, the government will hold meetings with various 
provincial and city people's committees of all the three regions 
-- namely, the south, the central highlands, and the north -- to 
review the problems encountered by various regions. This is to 
determine more substantive measures with which to resolve the 
difficult issues now encountered by each region. We will hold 
these meetings with various southern and northern regions by 
mid-July. The government will strive to promptly promulgate 
various bylaws to provide guidance for the enforcement of the 
laws already passed by the National Assembly at this session. 
At the same time, we will also reexamine and continue to 
supplement and perfect the current policy system. This will 
involve a large amount of difficult work." [end recording] 
  Next, Comrade Vu Mao, on behalf of the session secretariat, 
read the full text of the draft resolution of the fifth session 
which ratifies the United Nations' 1982 Convention on the Law of 
the Sea. He said: 
  [Begin Vu Mao recording] The National Assembly of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam [SRV] hereby decides : 
  "1. To ratify the United Nations' 1982 Convention on the Law 
of the Sea. 
  "2. Through the ratification of the United Nations's 1982 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, the SRV has demonstrated its 
determination to join with the world community in building a 
just legal order so as to encourage development and cooperation 
at sea. 
  "3. The National Assembly affirms SRV sovereignty over 
various areas of internal water [nooij thuyr] and territorial 
seas as well as its sovereignty and jurisdiction over areas of 
water adjoining the territorial seas, the exclusive economic 
zones, and the continental shelf of Vietnam on the basis of the 
stipulations of the convention and other principles of 
international law. Other countries are required to respect the 
above rights of Vietnam. 
  "4. The National Assembly once again affirms Vietnamese 
sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes, and its 
policy of settling all disputes over territorial sovereignty as 
well as other differences related to the Eastern Sea through 
peaceful negotiations in the spirit of equality, understanding, 
and mutual respect; and on the basis of respect for 
international law, particularly for the United Nations' 1982 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, and respect for the 
sovereignty and jurisdiction of coastal countries over their 
exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. 
  "After striving to negotiate a fundamental and long-term 
approach, all the parties concerned must maintain stability on 
the basis of maintaining the status quo without taking any 
actions that may further complicate the situation and must 
refrain from using force or threatening to use force. 
  "The National Assembly emphasizes that it is necessary to 
distinguish the issue of settling disputes over the Paracel and 
Spratly archipelagoes from the issue of defending various 
territorial seas and continental shelves under Vietnamese 
sovereignty and jurisdiction based on the principles and 
standards of the United Nations' 1982 Convention on the Law of 
the Sea. 
  "5. The National Assembly assigns the National Assembly 
Standing Committee and the government with the duty of studying 
those relevant stipulations of the state law so as to make 
necessary corrections in such a way as to suit the United 
Nations's 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea and to guarantee 
the interests of Vietnam. 
  "The National Assembly assigns the government with the duty 
of adopting effective measures to intensify the safeguarding and 
management of the various territorial seas and continental 
shelves belonging to Vietnam." [end recording] 
  Following this, the National Assembly passed the resolution 
by a show of hands. 
  At 1430 today, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh 
delivered a closing speech. After reviewing the socioeconomic 
situation over the past six months, he said: 
  [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] Apart from the improvements 
made, we still display many weaknesses that need to be overcome. 
There remain many great difficulties and ordeals to be 
surmounted. He pointed out: 
  "We must continue to ameliorate the financial and monetary 
system and increase the collection of the budget revenue to meet 
the demands of the budget expenditure. We must increase revenue 
collection along with economizing on spending. We must guard 
against wasteful spending while taking necessary measures to 
contain inflation at a single-digit level. We must concentrate 
on mobilizing and effectively using the sources of foreign and 
domestic capital to serve key construction projects and other 
projects already approved. We must create more conditions for 
the promotion of capital investment from various economic 
components in society as a whole and must encourage various 
business firms and families to use their own capital for the 
production business." 
  He went on: "We must pay great attention to minimizing the 
negative aspects of the market system in building a civilized 
and wholesome lifestyle and in taking up and developing the fine 
character of the folk culture and revolutionary ethical 
traditions. We must concern ourselves with the issue of creating 
employment for the working people, especially youths, and with 
the issue of eliminating social ills, especially in large cities 
and urban areas. 
  "The National Assembly urges the government and various 
sectors and echelons to vigorously carry out the economic 
renovation in conjunction with administrative reform. It is 
necessary to renovate the state apparatus in the direction of 
compactness and excellence, to improve the results and the 
effectiveness of the state and social management, to build a 
socialist democracy, to enhance legislation, and to create a 
mechanism capable of minimizing and eliminating negative 
phenomena in state management as well as in social life." 
  He concluded by saying: "Our country is facing great 
opportunities and great challenges. To successfully implement 
the resolution of the Seventh Party Congress and the resolution 
of the midterm national party conference, the National Assembly 
calls on compatriots and combatants nationwide as well as 
compatriots living abroad to be of the same heart and mind, to 
make full use of opportunities, repel danger, overcome all 
difficulties and obstacles, strive to consolidate and broaden 
the all-people unity bloc, uphold a sense of independence and 
sovereignty, be creative in developing the fine tradition of the 
nation, and have a determination to follow the forefathers' 
example of performing great deeds and advancing the country with 
the motto: All for a prosperous people, a powerful country, and 
an equitable and civilized society." 
  I hereby declare the fifth session of the Ninth National 
Assembly closed. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) cannot come to agree with the ruling coalition on key 
policies that would bring the party back to the coalition fold, 
SDP [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] General Secretary 
Wataru Kubo said Friday [24 June]. 
  Kubo told reporters the SDP handed down its position in a 
second round of meetings with coalition parties held Friday 
evening. 
  Kubo said the SDP and the coalition parties were unable to 
reach agreement on tax reform despite detailed discussions, with 
the ruling coalition calling for a consumption tax hike while 
the SDP is opposed to such a move. 
  Although it is not impossible to find ways to reach an 
agreement on tax reform, kubo said it is difficult considering 
the time limit under the current political situation. 
  The SDP and the ruling coalition parties also remained at 
odds over the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and the 
formation of a new government, he said. 
  "We heard that the leaders of the ruling coalition parties 
agreed earlier in the day that the cabinet's resignation is 
unnecessary," Kubo said. 
  "We consider that to mean that they cannot accept SDP 
demands" for the cabinet to resign en masse and to then form a 
new coalition government, he said. 
  Kubo said it is "truly regrettable" but the SDP has reached 
a 
conclusion that it cannot agree with the ruling parties on 
policies that are crucial for the SDP's return to the government. 
  He said, however, that the SDP and the coalition parties 
will 
hold talks again later in the day, after the coalition side 
meets to discuss the SDP's stance. 
  "But our stance is final," Kubo said. 
  Asked whether the SDP will support a no-confidence motion 
against the Hata government, which was submitted Thursday by the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kubo said the party is undecided. 
  Hata indicated Thursday that he is ready to resign with his 
ministers if it is necessary to bring the second largest 
opposition SDP back to the coalition. The SDP left the 
coalition in April. 
  Hata told a news conference he will leave everything, 
including his resignation, to the negotiations between the 
coalition parties and the SDP. 
  Hata also met SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama Thursday night 
in an unsuccessful attempt to tide over the political crisis. 
  The two-month old minority coalition and the SDP held two 
rounds of negotiations Friday in the morning and in the evening. 
  Meanwhile, LDP President Yohei Kono vowed to pass the no- 
confidence motion against Hata's government and bring his party 
back to power. 
  The LDP lost its nearly four-decades-long grip on power last 
August. 
  At a general meeting of parliamentarians from both houses of 
the Diet, Kono blasted the coalition, saying it has lost 
international respect for its "irresponsibleness." 
  He said the coalition government has not implemented any 
policies and leaves everything to the bureaucrats.

<F P=106> [News conference by Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata </F>
with unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime 
minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] The enactment of the 1994 budget has been delayed 
for a long time. Compared with past budget deliberations in the 
Diet, the 1994 budget was deliberated in the Diet for a very 
short time. The 1994 budget, that directly affects the 
livelihood of the people, was enacted today in the Diet. I 
would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to both the ruling 
and opposition parties for cooperating with each other in 
enacting the budget. I believe it is important to implement the 
budget steadily and early to stimulate the economy. Taking 
advantage of this opportunity, I would like to state my views. 
  The situation at home and abroad is very grim. I believe 
that in order to overcome the difficult situation, it is very 
important to establish an administration based on a solid 
foundation. The ruling coalition parties have begun policy 
discussions with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and 
other parties. I intend to leave issues, including the question 
of my resignation as prime minister, to the policy discussions. 
In any case, political parties that share the same political 
beliefs and policies should cooperate with each other in 
overcoming various obstacles while setting the final conclusion 
of the political reform as their biggest goal. I believe this 
is the way to overcome the present difficult situation and meet 
the people's wishes. I have stated my views. 
  [Dean of the Press Corps] As dean of the Press Corps, I 
would 
like to ask you some questions. The current Diet session has 
only a few days left, and political parties have begun moving at 
long last. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
formally submitted a no-confidence motion against the Hata 
cabinet at the Diet this evening. Mr. Prime Minister, how are 
you going to deal with the no- confidence motion? 
  [Hata] I have served as prime minister for about two months. 
Since I took office, I have said things must be done the same 
day. I, my cabinet members, and other officials have worked 
together to sincerely tackle tasks facing us every day from 
early morning to late night. I believe what I have tackled, 
proposed, and actually implemented deserve the people's 
approval. I also believe that my cabinet members and I have 
done our best to meet the people's goals or wishes. 
  [Dean of the Press Corps] Now, the ruling coalition parties 
are engaged in policy discussions with the SDPJ. SDPJ Chairman 
Murayama, however, has said the SDPJ Central Committee has 
decided to demand a general resignation of the Hata cabinet, and 
the general resignation of the Hata cabinet is a precondition 
for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. Mr. Prime 
Minister, you have just said you would leave the question of 
your resignation as prime minister to the policy discussions. 
How do you plan to deal with the SDPJ's demand for the general 
resignation of your cabinet? 
  [Hata] As for how to deal with the SDPJ's demand for the 
general resignation of my cabinet, both the ruling coalition 
parties and the SDPJ are discussing the question. I believe 
that I will have an opportunity to discuss the question with 
Chairman Murayama. I intend to hold frank and sincere talks. I 
would like you to understand my feelings when I say that I will 
entrust all the issues, including my future course for political 
career, to the talks. In any case, I intend to seek to make 
Chairman Murayama understand my position by telling him that I 
will leave the question of my resignation as prime minister, and 
other issues, to the policy discussions. 
  [Dean of the Press Corps] Sakigake stated today [23 June] 
that it agreed to the policies presented by the SDPJ, and called 
for the establishment of an administration headed by SDPJ 
Chairman Murayama. What do you think of this? 
  [Hata] Well, I think each has its own view. Therefore, I 
would like to refrain from commenting on the question. I think 
Sakigake members have various views. However, when my cabinet 
was formed, Sakigake stated they would support the cabinet from 
outside the coalition, and that its position is not that of an 
opposition party. I will not say anything more about this. 
  [Reporter] You said you would leave everything, including 
your future course as prime minister, to the policy talks. I 
dare to ask you: If the situation concerning voting for a 
no-confidence motion against the cabinet becomes delicate, do 
you have any intention of a voluntary cabinet resignation en 
masse as one option? 
  [Hata] The question is not whether I have such an intention 
or not. As I said, I would leave my future to the decision of 
the policy talks, I believe that a direction will be indicated 
through future talks. 
  [Reporter] The SDPJ reportedly has a view that, if the 
cabinet resigns en masse voluntarily, it will support you, Prime 
Minister Hata, as the next prime minister. I think, in this 
case, the resignation en masse itself is a ruse in a bid to take 
power. What do you think of the SDPJ's idea? 
  [Hata] I have not yet had direct talks with the SDPJ. 
Through talks with SDPJ leaders, including Chairman Murayama 
and Secretary General Kubo, I intend to inform them of my 
feelings. However, tasks that we have to tackle from now on 
include: political reform, economic restructuring, tax reform, 
administrative reform, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
the DPRK issue -- progress has now been made on this issue -- 
Japan's stance on the Naples summit, and policies toward the 
agricultural agreement under the Uruguay Round talks. All of 
these are very difficult issues. I believe it is necessary to 
form a stable administration to deal with them. I would like to 
explain my frank views on this point [to SDPJ leaders]. 
  [Reporter] There was an argument within the ruling coalition 
that it would cope with the political situation by carrying out 
a drastic cabinet reshuffle. At present, do you rule out this 
possibility? 
  [Hata] If I answer the question now, this will please you. 
However, I intend to convey my views to them at policy talks 
from now on, while hearing their opinions. As I intend to leave 
the question of my resignation to the policy coordination talks, 
I would like to deal with the talks with a clean slate. 
  [Reporter] I dare to ask you this question. If the future 
policy talks decide to name Mr. Hata as the next prime minister 
after the cabinet resigns en masse, would you accept the offer 
to become the prime minister? 
  [Hata] I am sorry but I cannot answer the question now. At 
any rate, this is an issue that will decide the future course of 
Japan. There will be opportunities for party representatives 
with various views to talk with each other. Since the 
discussion on the framework of a new administration are now in 
progress, I believe a direction will be indicated through this 
discussion. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, the LDP says that underlying 
its presentation of a no-confidence motion against your cabinet 
is the fact that the Cabinet is a minority, and therefore is not 
able to meet the people's expectations. What is your view of 
the LDP's reasoning? 
  [Hata] On this issue, I want to say that the reason the SDPJ 
separated from the coalition is not policy matters. As I have 
stated at Diet sessions, although I regret to say it, the SDPJ 
separated from the coalition in such a short period due to 
misunderstanding each other and a matter of wording. Therefore, 
I realize that the reason for the SDPJ's separation from us is 
not its sharp conflict over my policies as prime minister. To 
this day, I have managed the government while sincerely 
maintaining each of the policies agreed with the SDPJ. 
Therefore, I believe the SDPJ will be understanding in that 
respect. 
  [Reporter] You said you would like to leave everything, 
including the issue of your resignation, to the decision at the 
talks. I think what you have said is very important. I want to 
ask you again what the primary reason is that you have decided 
so. Also, did you make the decision today? 
  [Hata] Concerning this issue, well, as I said earlier, the 
issues that we are facing now, or those we will face in the 
future, are all very difficult problems. They include political 
reform, economic reform, which I mentioned earlier, and 
administration and financial reforms. Administration reform 
includes decentralization of power. There are also external 
problems in connection with the Uruguay Round of talks and 
agricultural agreements. These are really difficult problems. 
However, no matter how difficult they are, Japan should not 
avoid them. To make progress in these issues, it is necessary 
to establish a stable administration. The most important thing 
is for the government to work to make progress in these issues 
while seeking again an agreement with others in the process of 
talks on basic ideals and policies. I decided to leave 
everything, including the issue of my resignation, today, just 
before this news conference. 
  [Reporter] You said you need to establish a strong 
government to tide over difficulties. But I think it is normal 
for you to decide to dissolve the House of Representatives for a 
general election. Why did you not decide so? 
  [Hata] I did not because I have doubts about the need to 
dissolve the house now. There is another reason. I attended 
the meeting of the House of Councillors' Special Committee on 
Political Reform yesterday and the meeting of the House of 
Representatives' Special Committee on Political Reform the day 
before yesterday. As you know, political reform bills cleared 
the Diet under the former Hosokawa cabinet. But to enforce 
them, electoral constituencies have to be redrawn. The 
electoral redistricting panel on new constituency boundaries has 
submitted to the Diet a list of basic standards for redrawing. 
While observing Diet deliberations and arguments over the 
standards, the panel will soon start work to draw new 
boundaries. I think it is inappropriate to ignore this 
development and hold a general election under the current medium 
constituency system. 
  If the election is held under the current system, the 
political reform laws, which we have finally enacted, will mean 
nothing. The government will not be able to seek cooperation in 
resolving the issues I mentioned earlier if it avoids carrying 
out tasks that entail pains. In this context, it is necessary 
for the government to work out a bill to draw new constituencies 
based on the panel's recommendation, submit it to the Diet for 
deliberations, and enact it. I think the election should be 
held after these tasks have been completed. Otherwise, we will 
repeat the same thing over and over again. 
  [Reporter] If a no-confidence motion is submitted to the 
plenary session and is adopted, will you still choose 
resignation en masse, not the dissolution of the house? 
  [Hata] I would like to refrain from answering your question. 
Anyway, what I have always said is that the Japanese prime 
minister is not given the veto power as the U.S. President, who 
uses the power when he wants to kill bills. Therefore, the 
final resort for the prime minister to confront the Diet is the 
right to dissolve the House of Representatives. I do not deny 
the right to dissolve the house. I am just worried that if the 
election is held not in accordance with the political reform 
laws despite the fact that we have held much discussion on them, 
we will repeat the same thing again. Although I do not deny the 
right, I would like to avoid using it, if possible. Allow me to 
use the word 'if' in answering your question. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. You have said that you 
have not so far made mistakes in running the government and have 
dealt with issues in all sincerity in the belief that what must 
be done has to be done the same day. But you said that you have 
made a decision to leave everything, including your resignation 
-- taking it like a man -- to negotiations between the ruling 
parties and the SDPJ. What is your honest feeling now? 
  [Hata] Well, looking back, I have suffered considerable 
criticism. But in the past two months, my cabinet has made 
great efforts every day to tackle new issues and to seek new 
policies. From early in the morning -- from 7:30 AM or 8:00 AM 
for example -- and almost every day I have attended various 
councils or meetings. Even with regard to the issue of public 
utilities charges or the issue of the prices of goods, as well 
as improving the people's living conditions and creating our 
nation's diplomatic policies that can win the international 
community's understanding, I am personally confident that I have 
taken considerable leadership, and that those who sincerely 
supported my action appraise what I have done. The issues the 
government has to deal with are very important. There is the 
fact -- although it was regrettable -- that when my cabinet was 
inaugurated, it failed to take action in concert with the SDPJ, 
and now my cabinet -- it may be inappropriate for me to say my 
government is fragile -- is in a very difficult situation. To 
settle this issue, I think I should give up my position and 
leave the matter to negotiations, and then the door to a new 
course for the government will open. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have said that you hope 
to form a more stabilized foundation for the government. In 
connection with bringing new political forces together, there 
has reportedly been a strong view -- particularly within 
Shinseito -- calling for creating a conservatives-conservatives 
alliance, in addition to another view calling for the SDPJ's 
return to the ruling coalition. Although you seemed to have been 
calling for the SDPJ's return to the coalition, what is your 
view on such a call for forming an alliance with other 
conservatives? 
  [Hata] Underlying the call is the hope to form a new group 
with those who seceded from the LDP. For example, right before 
I was chosen as prime minister there was a call for forming a 
group with those led by Mr. Watanabe of the LDP. I think it is 
alright for us to get along with other conservatives in such a 
framework. However, I do not mean that I have a hostile feeling 
against the LDP itself but I honestly felt that if we formed an 
alliance with the LDP itself, Japan's politics would return to 
that established in 1955. Although you said there was a call 
within Shinseito, I think the members of Shinseito had the same 
feeling. If some members should leave the LDP to work for 
carrying out new politics, we are ready to frankly talk with 
them. In this sense, I think forming an alliance with the LDP 
will lead to bringing Japan's current politics -- which is 
drastically changing -- back to that created in 1955. Although I 
do not fully know what you mean by conservatives- conservatives 
alliance, this is what I feel about the idea of forming an 
alliance with other conservatives. 
  [Unidentified moderator] It is time to conclude the press 
conference. 
  [Hata] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A blue-ribbon government 
panel issued a final report on revision of the insurance law 
Friday [24 June], easing the way to settlement of the 
controversial "third- sector" issue in Japan-U.S. trade talks. 
  The Finance Ministry "should take measures in line with the 
report" submitted in June 1992 that called for special treatment 
on the timing for lifting the ban on the sector so as to protect 
foreign-affiliated and smaller insurance firms, the insurance 
council said in the final report. 
  Japan currently allows only foreign-affiliated insurers to 
sell so-called "third-sector" policies covering casualty, 
diseases and nursing, that combine the benefits of both life and 
nonlife insurance policies. 
  With the 1992 report allowing both Japanese life and nonlife 
insurers to enter the new sector, U.S. negotiators have demanded 
a five-year postponement at ongoing resumed bilateral 
"framework" talks on the insurance business. 
  The final report gives Japanese negotiators the flexibility 
to decide on specific dates as the ministry moves to submit 
bills next year which would otherwise lead to the implementation 
of revised laws in the fall of 1997. 
  The third sector "can become a panel issue which the 
administrative side alone can't judge," Hiromi Tokuda, chairman 
of the advisory forum to the finance minister, told reporters. 
  But uncertainties remain over an agreement in the trade 
talks 
as a ministry official, requesting anonymity, said Japan is 
insisting on lifting the ban in two years and the issue is 
expected to remain on the table "until the last moment" while an 
overall agreement on the insurance field is pursued. 
  The advisory panel has been working on concrete steps based 
on the earlier report to revise insurance-related laws for the 
first time in five decades. 
  As with the third-sector issue, "staged" implementation is 
the main feature of the final report's 10-point proposals to 
spur competition through deregulation while taking measures to 
protect policyholders. 
  The panel called on the ministry to first liberalize the 
insurance system, including mutual entry by life and casualty 
firms into each other's business fields "through subsidiaries," 
along with "quick legislation" of such measures as "solvency 
margins" and new management-checking systems to secure 
"soundness." 
  The solvency margin is a barometer of assets and risks 
similar to the capital-adequacy ratio for banks. 
  As the next stage, the forum wants the government to allow 
insurance firms to enter banking and other business areas 
through subsidiaries, after "ascertaining" the effects of the 
initial stage. 
  The ministry will submit bills only for the first stage next 
year, while reserving the second stage, a ministry official said. 
  As for other issues such as allowing banks to sell insurance 
policies, the panel decided to continue its discussions. 
  Other proposed new measures to check management include 
obliging disclosure under a set law, giving a right even to one 
policyholder to take representative action at mutual companies, 
and adopting a "fire wall" between parent firms and subsidiaries. 
  Japan's life insurers are all mutual companies which 
policyholders serve as stockholders. But the report paved the 
way for conversion to joint-stock companies, and also for mutual 
life insurers to issue bonds to procure funds. 
  As the mainstay to protect investors, the panel proposed 
establishing a nonprofit industry company similar to the banking 
industry's deposit insurance company to aid financially troubled 
insurance firms. 
  On deregulation, the forum recommended partial freeing in 
setting policy premiums and allowing insurance brokering.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Upper House [UH] on 
Thursday [23 June] approved revisions of a law on foreign 
lawyers which will ease restrictions on their operations in 
Japan, allowing them to participate in law firms jointly run 
with Japanese lawyers. 
  The law will come into force within a year. 
  Under the revisions, the employment of Japanese lawyers by 
foreign lawyers is still not permitted, but Japanese and foreign 
lawyers will be permitted, under certain conditions, to set up 
joint practices. 
  The revisions also ease the strict reciprocity which 
prevailed till now, allowing the Justice Ministry to use its 
discretion in accrediting foreign lawyers. 
  The revisions ease the number of years of experience 
required 
to gain accreditation, and allow foreign law firms to operate 
under their own names in Japan. 
  The United States and the European Union have criticized 
restrictions Japan places on the activities of foreign lawyers 
as against the principle of free competition.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa met with Myanmar [Burma] counterpart Ohn Gyaw in Tokyo 
on Friday [24 June] and called for an early transfer of power 
from the military junta to an elected civilian government, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Ohn Gyaw arrived in Japan on Monday for a weeklong stay to 
attend a meeting of the Environment Congress for Asia and the 
Pacific (Eco Asia '94) held Tuesday and Wednesday. 
  Officials said Kakizawa also called for the release of 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The nobel peace prize 
winner has been held under house arrest without charge since 
July 1989. 
  She led the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) 
to 
a landslide victory in elections in 1990. 
  But the military junta, which goes by the name of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), ignored the result 
and refused to transfer power to the elected representatives. 
  SLORC Chairman Gen. Than Shwe reportedly told a Japanese 
business delegation in Yangon earlier this month that the junta 
"should not stay in power for a long time" and that it is 
preparing "democratic foundations" for a civilian government.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Japan was the world's 
largest donor of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 1993 
for the third year in a row, Japanese officials said Friday [24 
June]. 
  Foreign Ministry officials, quoting figures released by the 
21-nation Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
said Japan's ODA rose 1.0 percent to 11.26 billion dollars. 
  The United States was second with 9.01 billion dollars, down 
16.7 percent, followed by France with 7.90 billion dollars, down 
4.5 percent, Germany with 6.85 billion dollars, down 9.7 percent 
and Italy with 2.91 billion dollars, down 29.4 percent. 
  But Japan ranked 18th among the 21 nations in terms of the 
ratio of ODA to gross national product (GNP), standing at 0.26 
percent. 
  The OECD data also showed ODA extended in 1993 by the 21 DAC 
member nations fell 11.4 percent from the previous year to 54.79 
billion dollars, marking the first double-digit fall. 
  The officials noted most industrial nations, suffering from 
economic slowdowns, are beginning to lose enthusiasm toward ODA.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A Japan-U.S.-European 
consortium of five companies signed an agreement Thursday [23 
June] with Russian authorities on a project for exploration of 
undersea oil and natural gas resources off Sakhalin, Russia, 
Japanese company officials said. 
  The agreement was signed in Washington by officials from the 
consortium, the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the 
local government of Sakhalin, the officials said. 
  The consortium comprises Mitsui and Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. 
of Japan, McDermott Inc. and Marathon Oil Co. of the United 
States and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. 
  They said the consortium will start exploration efforts in a 
few years, subject to approval by the Russian federal 
legislature and the local Sakhalin assembly, and start 
production early in the 21st century. 
  Surveys have shown the area proposed for exploration has 
potential deposits of 100 million tons of crude oil and 400 
billion cubic meters of natural gas. 
  Crude oil production from the project, which is expected to 
cost approximately 1 trillion yen, is expected to amount to a 
maximum of 180,000 barrels per day. 
  All the crude oil produced will be exported to Asia, 
including Japan, while two-thirds of the natural gas will be 
exported and the rest will be consumed in Russia, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Indonesian Research and 
Technology Minister Bacharuddin J. Habibie on Wednesday [22 
June] said he has a "clean and clear" conscience on his role in 
the Indonesian Government's controversial purchase of 39 
warships and a related clampdown on the country's media. 
  "I always can sleep because I have a very clean and clear 
conscience," Habibie told reporters at a press conference held 
on the last day of a visit to Japan that began June 12. 
  The minister's remarks followed a government decision 
Tuesday 
to immediately revoke the licenses of three leading magazines -- 
DETIK, EDITOR and TEMPO -- for failing to heed previous warnings 
not to step out of line. 
  Habibie, a close protege of President Suharto and potential 
successor, refuted remarks attributed to him that an article in 
TEMPO about the warship purchase left him unable to sleep for a 
full day and made him determined to make the magazine "sleep" 
for the rest of its life. 
  "What a fantasy," he said. "That remark I have never given 
and I sleep very well any time if I need to sleep." 
  The government's purchase of warships used by the former 
East 
Germany has been widely criticized as the warships are outdated. 
Finance Minister Mar'ie muhammad approved only part of the 1.1 
billion dollars sought by Habibie for the purchase and local 
refit of the ships.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Market intervention alone 
will not help the yen to stop its uptrend against the dollar, 
Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Friday [24 June], 
while repeating concerns over the yen's rise on the recovering 
economy. 
  "How to guide the economic fundamentals is the most 
important," Mieno said, citing the huge trade surplus as the key 
factor for Japan in hinting why the Group of Seven major nations 
are not taking joint moves as it did in may. 
  In making a speech and answering questions at the National 
Press Club, Mieno said Japan's huge current account surplus 
"often" surfaces as a major factor behind the yen's rise, and 
measures to correct this is "the most important." 
  His comments came after the dollar plunged in New York 
Tuesday to hit a new global low of 99.85-95 yen. It is now 
moving nervously around 101 yen with dealers saying that the 
market is testing an accord among Group of Seven (G-7) major 
nations to act jointly to stem excess currency volatility. 
  But unlike the joint G-7 intervention taken in May when the 
dollar tumbled near to fall below 100 yen, they said the Bank of 
Japan has acted alone to defend the dollar's fall against the 
yen. 
  In a disappointing U.S. move for market participants, U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement Wednesday, 
only saying, "we continue to be in close communication with our 
G-7 partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as 
appropriate." 
  Mieno also said he is watching currency movements with 
great concern and will take "appropriate and timely actions in 
close contact with other G-7 nations." 
  The central bank chief reiterated that the yen's rise is 
one of the key risk factors for the recovering economy, and 
noted that the stronger yen first brings "near-term demerits" on 
exports although there are benefits on import prices in the 
longer run. 
  The yen's rise makes Japanese products expensive overseas 
and foreign goods cheaper in Japan. 
  On the economy, Mieno said in his speech it has "moved one 
step" forward, and in answer to questions, that it is "steadily 
moving" toward a recovery. 
  The recent improvements are supported by a background that 
is different from that prevailing at the same time last year, 
when the economy fell back toward the summer after showing signs 
of recovery, he said. 
  Mieno cited recovering corporate earnings, progress in 
restructuring efforts, and improving economies abroad as the 
main differences with last year. 
  Considering risks aside from the yen's rise, Mieno pointed 
out still-tough conditions of corporate capital investment and 
labor, and said more time is needed for adjustments. 
  He also expressed concern over emerging competition from 
other asian nations and former communist countries, deriving 
from the yen's rise and favorable conditions in the 
labor-intensive field. 
  Against this backdrop, Mieno said that macroeconomic 
measures should continue to serve as a "cushion" against 
still-tough conditions, primarily by supporting personal and 
corporate spending. 
  On long-term interest rates, the central bank chief said 
the recent rises reflect market sentiment about the economy, but 
market players should take more carefully into consideration 
"both good and bad indicators" yet expected to appear. 
  Long-term rates should settle at levels reflecting the 
state of the economy, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ] 
Governor Yasushi Mieno said Friday [24 June] the possibility is 
high that Japan's economy has begun moving toward a recovery. 
  Speaking at the National Press Club of Japan, the central 
bank chief pointed to emerging bright signs on the economic 
horizon in a remark following his past comments on the state of 
the economy. 
  Mieno went on to say that corporate activities seem on a 
recovery path, citing an improvement in personal spending in 
some categories and increasing exports. 
  As for the yen's recent surge that saw it shoot past the 100 
to the dollar level, Mieno said he has serious concern about 
foreign exchange rates and noted that he will take appropriate 
action whenever needed while keeping close contact with other 
group of seven industrialized nations. 
  He said the yen's sharp appreciation should help promote an 
industrial shakeup in Japan. 
  On corporate investment, one of the main driving forces of 
the economy, Mieno said that it would take time to see corporate 
investment in plant and equipment pick up because adjustments to 
past excessive investment remain. 
  Mieno apparently made the comment in view of the nation's 
gross domestic output for the January-March quarter announced 
Tuesday, which showed the economy growing at an annual rate of 
3.9 percent, or the best performance in three years, on the 
strength of personal spending and not corporate investment.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The money market is 
expected to see a 1.8 trillion yen net liquidity surplus in 
July, excluding government bond issuance, the Bank of Japan 
[BOJ] said Friday [24 June]. 
  The amount will be up from the 1.63 trillion yen surplus 
posted last July, the central bank said. 
  The return of cash into the banking system following 
payments 
of summer bonuses in June is projected to generate a net 600 
billion yen cash inflow, compared with 678 billion yen last July. 
  Together with the cash inflow, a net 1.2 trillion yen inflow 
of treasury funds is forecast to put the overall net surplus at 
1.8 trillion yen. The fiscal inflow was 958 billion yen in July 
1993. 
  The balance of outstanding bank of Japan notes is predicted 
to rise 4.9 percent year on year at the end of July. 
  Redemptions of government bonds are expected to create a net 
inflow of 2.66 trillion yen into the money market, down from 
3.35 trillion yen a year before, while collection of withholding 
tax is projected to prompt a fiscal outflow of 4.21 trillion yen 
compared to a 4.96 trillion yen in July last year.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Personal savings continued 
growing slowly amid lower incomes and interest rates, with the 
end-March outstanding balance rising 4.8 percent from a year 
earlier, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] said Friday [24 June] in a 
preliminary quarterly report. 
  The balance came to 882.44 trillion yen, an increase of 3.23 
trillion yen in the January-March quarter, compared with the 
2.56 trillion yen gain for the same period a year earlier, the 
central bank said. 
  The 4.8 percent yearly growth was marginally higher than a 
record low growth of 4.7 percent at the end of the previous 
October-December quarter. 
  The March figure brought to an end the 
eight-straight-quarter 
streak of slower growth, a bank official said. 
  But it is still hard to say if the trend has turned upward, 
the official said, noting the growth remained relatively small, 
compared with the 6.6 percent annual increase at the end of 
March 1992 when the current weak trend began. 
  Asked about the outlook for the April-June period, the 
official said only that the balance may not decline further but 
is also unlikely to grow rapidly. 
  The balance of personal savings at banks rose 3.6 percent 
from a year earlier to 215.85 trillion yen with a decrease in 
the reporting quarter of 1.94 trillion yen, compared with the 
year-earlier fall of 2.63 trillion yen. 
  The postal savings balance rose 7.7 percent to 183.10 
trillion yen with a quarterly increase of 2.22 trillion yen, 
down from a 3.01 trillion yen increase the previous year. 
  Savings in products offered by trust banks declined 20.1 
billion yen during the first quarter of 1994, compared with a 
295.4 billion yen rise a year earlier, while the balance grew 
3.3 percent to 49.67 trillion yen. 
  Investment in public and corporate bonds gained 1.6 billion 
yen, up from the year-earlier decline of 2.43 trillion yen, but 
the balance posted a 3.4 percent fall to 39.51 trillion yen. 
  Investment trusts dropped by 1.05 trillion yen, compared 
with 
the 1.02 trillion yen fall a year earlier, and the balance 
declined 6.9 percent to 34.27 trillion yen. 
  The balance of insurance savings climbed 8.7 percent to 
204.70 trillion yen with an increase of 4.58 trillion yen in the 
quarter, down from the year-before 5.30 trillion yen gain.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] plans to curb growth in budget requests for fiscal 1995, 
with general operating expenditures for policy implementation 
being cut by 10 percent from the previous year, ministry sources 
said Thursday [23 June]. 
  As the long-overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 was finally 
approved by the Diet earlier in the day, the ministry started 
work on setting the ceiling for next year's budget requests from 
government ministries, agencies and related sectors. 
  The ceiling is likely to be announced sometime in July, the 
sources said. 
  They said the ministry expects the government's fiscal 
position to remain tight next fiscal year, starting April 1, 
1995, as revenues from corporate taxes are likely to decline 
amid the continued recession. 
  The balance of government bonds, expected to top 200 
trillion 
yen at the end of next March, will also keep the ministry 
tight-fisted, they added. 
  They said the ministry plans to set a 10 percent cut in 
general operating spending earmarked for policy objectives from 
the budget ceiling for the current fiscal year. 
  It will be the 12th straight annual cut in the general 
operating outlays minus expenses such as personnel expenses, 
investment expenditures and spending for Official Development 
Assistance (ODA). 
  In addition, the ministry plans to curb government subsidies 
and review allocations of public-works investment to avoid 
criticism that it has become inflexible in budget appropriations. 
  Aside from the budget ceiling, the ministry wants to 
circulate a request in government ministries and agencies to cut 
in principle office expenses by around 10 percent each, the 
sources said. 
  In allocating public-works investment, the ministry will put 
emphasis on construction projects for housing, sewage and public 
parks. But spending on projects for industrial infrastructure 
will be tightened, they added. 
  The ministry wants to curb growth in expenditure on 
public-works investment itself, but has not decided on the 
matter because of opinions that such spending should be 
increased to stimulate the economy. 
  In fiscal 1994, the budgetary ceiling on public-works 
investment was increased by 5 percent from the previous year. 
  The ministry, meanwhile, plans to set separate-account 
spending on agricultural projects in fiscal 1995, as Japan 
partially lifted a rice import ban in line with the agreement in 
December 1993 of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the sources 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Friday [24 June] shunned calls for specific figures and 
dates on a consumption tax hike to offset income tax cuts in a 
planned tax reform. 
  "As financial authorities, we want a conclusion that will 
not 
lead to untreated issuance of deficit-covering bonds," Fujii 
told reporters after a cabinet meeting. 
  But, apparently backing off from recent comments he made 
directly urging specific figures and dates, Fujii did not 
elaborate on reported discussions between the coalition parties 
and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to put off the decision on 
the scale and dates for the tax hike. 
  The proposed offsetting tax hike has become the 
controversial 
policy issue for the SDP considering returning to the coalition 
government which fell to a minority rule after the party seceded 
from the coalition in late April. 
  The tax reform plan of continuing tax cuts and hiking the 
consumption tax was proposed separately on Tuesday by panels of 
the government and the ruling parties without figures and dates 
for later political decision. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii also checked top-level political 
developments by urging the tax reform be made into bills by the 
end of this month to enact into law by the year-end. 
  "We must keep the deadline," he said, referring to Japan's 
promise made in the March market-opening package. 
  Turning to currency exchange rates, Fujii described the 
statement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen as "meaning 
heavy." 
  The statement, issued Wednesday, a day after the dollar 
plunged against the German mark and the yen, said, "we continue 
to be in close communication with our G-7 (Group of Seven) 
partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as appropriate." 
  Asked why the United States is not jointly intervening as it 
did in May, Fujii said, "we are taking all possible measures at 
every level." 
  The U.S. dollar tumbled below 100 yen in New York on Tuesday 
for the first time in the postwar period to hit a global low of 
99.85- 99.95 yen. It is now trading nervously around 101 yen 
with dealers saying that the market is testing the G-7 accord 
for joint moves to stem excess volatility. 
  They said the Bank of Japan alone has made noticeable 
intervention against the yen's rise.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), poised to rejoin the ruling coalition, is proposing the 
introduction of a numbering system for Japanese taxpayers by 
2001 as part of national tax reforms, SDP sources said Thursday 
[23 June]. 
  The SDP, which split from the coalition in April in protest 
at maneuverings by its partners to create a new Diet bloc 
excluding the party, is moving to rejoin the fold. 
  The sources said the numbering system would facilitate fair 
combined taxation and plug tax loopholes. 
  The SDP proposal, which also calls for increased 
contributions from the national treasury for basic pensions, 
gives more emphasis to fairer taxation and public welfare 
measures than similar proposals by the government's tax 
commission and a coalition panel. 
  The proposal will be discussed at policy consultations on 
Friday morning between representatives of the SDP and member 
parties of the ruling coalition, the sources said. 
  Sharp differences on tax reforms remain, however, between 
the 
SDP and the ruling parties over the extent of a raise in the 
consumption tax from the present 3 percent and other issues, 
they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 a government panel on Friday [24 
June] approved a long-term plutonium use program that rules out 
the manufacturing and possession of plutonium in a greater 
amount than needed for its nuclear power generation, officials 
said. 
  The peaceful plutonium use program received approval by the 
Atomic Energy Commission, the nation's highest nuclear 
policy-formulating panel, headed by Science and Technology 
Agency Director General Mikio Omi, they said. 
  To this end, the committee decided to defer a plan to start 
the operation of a projected second plutonium extraction plant 
until after 2010, when it was originally scheduled to start up. 
The second plant is only on the drawing board, with its 
construction site undecided. 
  Completion of the second extraction plant would increase 
Japan's plutonium production capability beyond that of an 
extraction plant now under construction at the village of 
Rokkasho in Aomori Prefecture, they said. 
  The Rokkasho factory is Japan's first plutonium extraction 
facility that will start producing plutonium in 2001. 
  The officials said the new program was officially adopted to 
eliminate international anxieties that Japan may divert excess 
plutonium into atomic weapons production. 
  On top of its compliance with safeguards obligations to 
accept regular, unimpeded checks by international atomic energy 
agency monitors, Japan will never exchange nuclear technologies 
with countries other than Britain, France, Germany and the 
United States to prevent nuclear arms proliferation, the report 
says. 
  The report, adopted by the commission Friday, says the 
government will make policy decisions around 2010 concerning the 
extraction capacity and technology for use in the planned second 
extraction plant. 
  The program calls for burning plutonium from Japan's 
existing 
nuclear reactors at a few light water-type nuclear reactors for 
electricity generation, starting in the latter half of the 
1990s, the report says. 
  Japan now entrusts British and French extraction plants with 
extracting plutonium from its nuclear reactors. 
  The number of light water-type nuclear reactors that will 
use 
plutonium as part of its fuel will be increased to more than 10 
by 2010 to consume an increased amount of plutonium coming from 
the Rokkasho plant, it says. 
  However, Japan will not scrap its basic nuclear policy of 
counting on "nuclear fuel cycle" for its future electricity 
needs, the report says. 
  Nuclear fuel cycle refers to electricity-generation use of 
plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods downloaded from a 
nuclear reactor that is energized by enriched uranium. 
  In line with this basic stance, Japan will start building a 
"demonstrator" fast-breeder reactor (FBR) with the power 
generation capacity of 660,000 kilowatts at the onset of the 
21st century, they said. It will be followed by construction of 
another FBR to be put into commercial use by 2030, they said. 
  The FBR, which generates electricity by burning plutonium, 
is 
known to produce more plutonium than it consumes. 
  The new decision to defer the planned operation of a second 
plutonium extraction plant will force Japan to store spent 
nuclear fuel downloaded from various reactors inside the 
premises of various nuclear power plants, the report says. 
  While storing the spent nuclear fuel in the nuclear plants 
for the time being, Japan will consider how to more effectively 
store the spent nuclear fuel that will accumulate in coming 
years, according to the report.

  [Text] Honolulu, June 21 KYODO -- Japan's Air Self-Defense 
Force (ASDF) made its debut in the U.S.-led five-nation Rim of 
the Pacific Exercise (Rimpac) this year, sources familiar with 
the military drills said Tuesday [21 June]. 
  Two ASDF officers joined the exercise to train in sea-based 
aerial warfare under U.S. Navy guidance, the sources said. 
  The large-scale joint military drills of the United States, 
Japan, South Korea, Canada and Australia were conducted this 
month in the Pacific Ocean between the Hawaiian and the Midway 
Islands. 
  More than 200 aircraft and 50 naval ships, including, for 
the 
first time, the largest Japanese destroyer Kongo equipped with 
the Aegis air defense system participated in the drills. 
  The sources said ASDF officers have never before undergone 
training during a Rimpac maneuver. In the framework of 
bilateral defense cooperation with the U.S., closer links are 
needed between the armies, navies and air forces to realize "the 
desired comprehensive joint strategy," they said. 
  The participation of ASDF personnel "This time was the first 
strategic move to realize that goal," the sources said. 
  The officers were acting as "ambush control officers" aboard 
the Kongo, guiding Japanese fighter aircraft by radar to 
intercept "enemy" combat planes. 
  Under guidance of a U.S. Navy expert, the two officers 
studied how to control and direct the dispatch of fighters from 
aircraft carriers and the launching of ship-to-air missiles, the 
sources said. 
  The Kongo, equipped with the latest radar technology, is the 
MSDF's most advanced combat vessel. 
  In the past, the training of ASDF personnel aboard U.S. 
aircraft equipped with the AWACS (airborne warning and control 
system) during joint military exercises with the U.S. has 
sparked protests from defenders of Japan's postwar Constitution, 
which bans the use or threat of force to settle international 
disputes. 
  They said such training conflicts with the widely accepted 
view that the Constitution rules out collective defense.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A government panel led by 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [24 June] gave the 
go-ahead on 21 items for deregulation, including making it 
easier to get a driving license for large motorcycles, officials 
said. 
  The items approved by the office of market access will be 
included in a deregulation plan to be announced next week in 
line with the market-access scheme unveiled by the government in 
March. 
  The government will try to include specific deadlines for 
each item as much as possible, the officials said. 
  The easing of procedures to obtain a license for motorcycles 
with displacement volumes of 400 cc or greater has been 
requested not only by domestic manufacturers but by U.S. 
companies as well. 
  Friday's approval by the office came in response to an 
earlier submission of the 21 deregulatory proposals by the 
Market Access Ombudsman Council, led by Yoshio Okawara, a former 
ambassador to the United States and currently a Foreign Ministry 
adviser. 
  The Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman, a system under 
the Economic Planning Agency, is composed of the Market Access 
Ombudsman Council and the decision-making Office of Market 
Access. 
  Starting in fiscal 1996 that begins in April of that year, 
the license can be obtained at driving schools instead of having 
to go to offices of prefectural public safety commissions. 
  Other deregulatory measures include easing rules on auto 
inspection and on specifications related to clothing.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The government should in 
principle give the postal savings system full discretion over 
the investment of postal savings funds, a study group for the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] said Friday [24 
June]. 
  The proposal takes aim at the existing rules that require a 
large portion of the funds to go to the Finance Ministry's Trust 
Fund Bureau which uses it to finance public works projects, a 
practice that results in a limited return. 
  Under an agreement between the two ministries, the remaining 
portion of the funds is invested largely in public bonds at the 
postal ministry's discretion. 
  The study group, in a report presented to the director 
general of the Postal Savings Bureau, said the government should 
shift its policy on postal funds from the current rigid one to 
one allowing the Postal Ministry basic discretion over how to 
invest the funds. 
  It said the amount of postal savings funds to be entrusted 
to 
the Trust Fund Bureau should be determined on the basis of 
funding needs for public works projects instead of entrusting 
all of the funds to it first. 
  Among other proposals, the report gives high marks to one 
put 
forward by some economists that public entities issue bonds for 
postal savings funds instead of borrowing funds from the Trust 
Fund Bureau as at present. 
  The Trust Fund Bureau lends such funds using postal savings 
funds entrusted by the Postal Ministry. 
  The report is in line with a persistent call from the Postal 
Ministry to the Finance Ministry to expand the scope of its 
discretionary investment of postal savings funds. 
  But the report has drawn a quick, cool response from the 
finance ministry. "It embodies the desire of the postal savings 
system to become a huge institutional investor. Nobody will 
understand it," a Finance Ministry official said. 
  In fiscal 1993, that ended March 31, postal savings funds 
subject to the Postal Ministry's discretionary investment 
totaled 4.75 trillion yen. 
  The sum of such funds is to increase to 5 trillion yen from 
fiscal 1994 through 1996 under an agreement already reached 
between the two ministries.

  [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul plans to offer a 
draft agreement to Pyongyang at the summit preparatory contact 
on June 28, a strategy aimed at minimizing the number of 
necessary contacts before the inter-Korean summit actually takes 
place, according to officials here. 
  The draft, tentatively named "the agreement on opening a 
South-North Korea top leaders' meeting," must be tabled at the 
first preparatory contact on June 28 so that the two sides can 
get right down to setting the time and place for the summit and 
then sign the agreement at the next contact, the officials say. 
  The government is said to have already completed the draft, 
which is most likely to establish the number of delegates, 
accompanying assistants and the size of the press corps. 
  They would have to cover protocol for both sides, the 
itinerary, the actual site and facilities for the summit 
meeting, a guarantee of the personal safety of all visitors, and 
arrangements for their trips. 
  The officials say they will not demand that every little 
detail be written down on all of the above procedures in the 
draft agreement so that the date of the summit can be arranged 
as soon as possible. 
  Instead, they envision separate working-level contacts on 
these details after the overall agreement is signed. 
  At least one week of careful planning is thought to be 
required before the summit date. 
  This gives Seoul approximately two weeks of minimum required 
time, one week to work on and sign the agreement on the summit 
and another week to settle on the details. Seoul then could 
propose the summit date around July 10 or by mid-July at the 
latest. 
  As to where the top leaders will meet, the officials said 
they will go ahead and propose the South Korean capital of 
Seoul. But as long as North Korea agrees to hold the summit as 
soon as possible, the South is willing to meet in the North 
Korean capital of Pyongyang, according to officials. 
  "We will ask for Seoul, but if that doesn't work out, then 
Pyongyang is a possibility," said one official. 
  "There has been talk of a third place, like the case of 
Germany, but we have to take into consideration that there are 
not many facilities suitable for a summit meeting in North Korea 
other than Pyongyang," he said. 
  But there is one case in which Seoul will not compromise on 
-- if North Korea insists on meeting Aug. 15, the anniversary of 
Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule and also a date 
that North Korea commonly uses for its political propaganda. 
  In that case, officials said they will demand Seoul as the 
meeting site. If Pyongyang refuses, then they will think about 
the neutral zone -- the truce village of Panmunjom -- or a third 
place in South Korea. 
  Considering all these factors, South and North Korea will 
both probably have to make concessions, one side on the place 
and the other side on the time. 
  As stated before, Seoul officials plan to make 
agenda-setting 
as general as possible to lessen the chances of bickering over 
agenda topics. 
  The proposed agenda will be very comprehensive, according to 
the officials, covering immediate issues confronting South and 
North Korea and other matters proposed by the top leaders, or 
ways of removing political and military confrontation including 
the nuclear problem and implementation of wide-ranging exchanges 
and cooperation. 
  On arrangements for bodyguards, entourages and the press, 
Seoul intends to include these terms in the overall agreement if 
North Korea does not object but is willing to leave it to 
working-level contacts.

<F P=106> [By Kim Chae-mok] </F>
  [Text] It was confirmed on 24 June that the ROK Government 
has established a policy to take the initiative to support the 
construction of light-water reactors for North Korea and is 
examining various concrete measures. 
  It is anticipated that President Kim Yong-sam will actively 
propose the ROK Government's policy to President Kim Il-song if 
the summit talks are realized. 
  The government policy is one of the active initiatives for 
assuring North Korea's nuclear transparency and providing a 
breakthrough in economic cooperation between the North and the 
South. Whether or not North Korea will accept the proposal will 
be noteworthy. 
  A high-ranking government official said on 24 July: "North 
Korea has explained to the United States about its plan to 
convert the current graphite-moderated reactors to light-water 
reactors and requested the United States to support this but the 
United States is having difficulties in providing actual support 
due to its domestic laws even though it agrees to the plan in 
principle. In this context, our government is preparing 
measures to take the initiative to participate in the 
construction of light-water reactors in North Korea." 
  The official also said: "It is inevitable that North Korea's 
light-water reactor construction will be a multinational project 
involving the United States, Japan, and Russia. The ROK 
Government will soon begin discussing detailed support measures 
with the United States and Japan." 
  Another government official said: "The core question of the 
North Korean light-water reactor project is who will provide the 
capital. The ROK Government is examining a plan to assist North 
Korea in obtaining construction funds from the Asian Development 
Bank by guaranteeing the repayments." 
  Meanwhile, during a meeting with Selig Harrison, senior 
fellow of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, North 
Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said: "The United 
States could request Russia to provide light-water reactor 
technology to North Korea, and South Korea and Japan could 
provide the capital." 
  In the event that the ROK, the United States, and Japan 
reach 
an agreement to support North Korea's light-water reactor 
construction project, the project could begin upon the signing 
of a bilateral or multilateral treaty on nuclear power 
assistance. 
  It is estimated that the construction of one light-water 
reactor in North Korea would cost $1 billion to $1.5 billion for 
a period of over 10 years.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 (YONHAP) -- The former Soviet Union's 
KGB believed back in 1990 that North Korea already secured a 
nuclear detonator, the SANKEI SHIMBUN here said in a dispatch 
from Moscow on Friday. 
  Quoting a story appearing in the Friday evening issue of 
IZVESTYA, SANKEI said the report filed by KGB to Soviet 
leadership in February 1990 said in part, "North Korea already 
has its first nuclear detonator and is simply withholding its 
test to keep it a secret." 
  The KGB report said that it had obtained from a reliable 
source the information that North Korea was indulging in 
research on the production of nuclear weapons in a bid to 
maintain a military edge over South Korea and join the group of 
nuclear countries. 
  Explaining about difference between "nuclear detonator" and 
"nuclear bomb," IZVESTYA reportedly said the existence of a 
nuclear detonator means there are nuclear weapons. 
  The contents of the report have high credibility as it was 
prepared by Col. V.L. Smolinov of 16th department of KGB's 
Second General Bureau, IZVESTYA added.

Relations Department, from Seoul on the activities of Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai in the Republic of Korea on 24 June -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Today is the second day of an official visit to the 
Republic of Korea by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. He is the 
first Thai prime minister to have ever visited the Republic of 
Korea in 13 years after General Prem Tinsulanon, former Thai 
prime minister, paid an official visit to Korea in 1981. 
  Therefore, the visit can be regarded as a good sign for the 
opening of a new era of good relations between Thailand and the 
Republic of Korea, or South Korea, in order to futher strengthen 
and develop relations betwen the two countries in the economic, 
trade, and investment fields. 
  At 1030 local time, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai met and 
discussed official matters with President Kim Yong-sam of the 
Republic of Korea. 
  When the motorcade of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai arrived 
at 
the Presidential Palace, President Kim Yong-sam welcomed the 
Thai guest at the front corridor of the Presidential Palace. He 
then accompanied the Thai prime minister into the main hall to 
sign the visitor's book. The Korean president and Thai prime 
minister had their pictures taken at the staircase of the main 
hall before an official discussion between the two leaders began. 
  Thai officials participating in the meeting were Sarasin 
Wiraphon, director general of the America and South Pacific 
Department, and Taen Paramatwinai, director general of the East 
Asia Department of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. 
  After the discussion, the Thai prime minister bade farewell 
to the Korean president at the front corridor of the 
Presidential Palace.

  [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai discussed enhancing 
bilateral relations, promoting cooperation for Asia-Pacific 
development and current affairs in the region, including the 
nuclear dispute with North Korea, in a meeting at Chongwadae 
[presidential offices] Friday morning. 
  Kim, stressing the need to settle the North Korean nuclear 
row for Asia-Pacific peace and security, explained to Chuan the 
projected inter-Korean summit on the nuclear and other issues. 
  He requested that Thailand make additional tariff cuts and 
offer more cooperation in Korea's corporate investment in the 
Thai construction and communications industries, as well as its 
support for Seoul's bids to become a non-permanent U.N. Security 
Council member and to elect a Korean as World Trade Organization 
(WTO) secretary-general. 
  Chuan, supporting Kim's efforts to make the Korean peninsula 
free of nuclear arms, expressed hope for increased economic 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  He said he would positively consider creating an investment 
climate that favors Korean companies advancing into his country.

relations department correspondent] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, accompanied by a 
delegation, arrived at the Seoul's Air Force Command airport at 
1510 local time to begin his official visit to the Republic of 
Korea from today to 26 June as the guest of Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam. The prime minister was welcomed upon his arrival by 
ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Chuchai Kasemsan, Thai 
ambassador to the ROK. The prime minister was accompanied by 
the Korean foreign minister and they reviewed the guards of 
honor. The prime minister and his delegation also visited the 
Korean national monument for a wreath-laying ceremony. 
  Speaking about his visit to South Korea, Prime Minister 
Chuan 
Likphai said he will take the opportunity to discuss with Korean 
leaders about the trade imbalance problem and will persuade 
South Korea to invest more in Thailand. He noted that Korean 
investment in Thailand is still very low. He looks forward to 
the possibility of Korea's opening up its markets for farm 
products from other countries, especially rice from Thailand, in 
keeping with the GATT agreements. It is anticipated that Korea 
might import as much as 50,000 tons of rice from other countries 
next year. How much of that quota Thailand will be allocated 
depends on the negotiations. The prime minister said that South 
Korea is a GATT member and despite its political problems, the 
country will have to abide by GATT agreements and open the 
country for farm products. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he also learned that the 
Board of Investment, or BOI, declared 10 more trade categories 
entitled to promotional privileges. He will inform South Korean 
businessmen of this and urge them to invest in Thailand. He 
wishes to see more investment from South Korea since there is 
still very little interest in Thailand from South Korean 
businessmen, who still prefer to invest in Vietnam. Korea, he 
said, is facing a growing wage problem and he will persuade 
Korean investors to invest in Thailand.

  [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- South Korea lagged behind 
the "three Chinas" -- China, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- in terms of 
exports so far this year. 
  According to the trend of exports by South Korea's major 
rival countries disclosed by the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. on 
Wednesday, South Korea's exports totaled 33.5 billion dollars in 
the first five months of this year whereas the amount was 37.5 
billion dollars for China and 36.1 billion dollars for Taiwan. 
  Hong Kong exported 43.1 billion dollars already in the first 
four months. 
  The rate of exports growth was 12 percent for South Korea, 
much more than Taiwan's 3.3 percent. But, it was just about 
half as high as China's, 24.1 percent. 
  In the January-May period, South Korean imports reached 
39.05 
billion dollars, slightly less than China's 39.28 billion 
dollars.

Cooperation Center: "Plans for Applying Russian Science and 
Technology"] 
<H5>  [20 Apr 94 p 16] </H5>
  [Text] No small efforts are being made by ROK industry and 
research organizations to obtain and make use of superior 
Russian technology. Kim Tae-sun, director of the Moscow office 
of the Korea-Russia Science and Technology Cooperation 
Center---an annex of the Korea Institute of Science and 
Technology (KIST), sent articles on plans for applying the 
Russian science and technology he has seen and felt on the scene 
since May 1992. We present this in two installments. 
  One of the fields with the greatest prospects for 
cooperation 
with Russia is the software industry. Until now, Russia had no 
fixed laws on private property. With much investment made in 
facilities under these conditions, scientific and technological 
cooperation carries with it many risks of various kinds. One 
area which is important to us and which minimizes facility 
investment is the software industry. The shortage of computers 
is serious even in many of Russia's superior research 
organizations. Therefore, many research centers make use of PCs 
(personal computers), even if that is all they have, to conduct 
applied research. As a result, much software and many 
applications were developed using PCs. 
  Another field with prospects for cooperation, even though 
less know to us, is dedicated IC (integrated circuit) design and 
manufacturing technology. Unilaterally, Russian IC design and 
manufacturing technology does not appear to be that superior. 
Manufacturing technology in particular is lacking: it can be 
said to be considerably behind Japan and the U.S. in 
mass-production technology. Therefore, compared to present ROK 
memory-IC manufacturing technology, Russian technology can be 
said to be markedly backward. 
  Thinking about dedicated-IC design and manufacture, even in 
Russia's present situation, it is a suitable field for 
technological-cooperation with ROK industry. In Russia there are 
many organizations capable of designing and manufacturing 
dedicated IC. The productive capacity of most of these 
organizations, however, is considerably inferior. That is, 
although the semiconductor industry is not at a high level, it 
has many organizations capable of small-quantity-high-variety, 
dedicated-IC design and manufacturing. The present circumstances 
thus provide related ROK industries with conditions favorable 
for cooperation. 
  As a cooperative sector favorable for dedicated-IC design 
and 
manufacturing, it could provide good partners for many ROK 
enterprises handling the manufacture of electronics-related 
instruments. In particular, companies making products (for 
example, medical instruments, communications instruments, and 
measuring instruments) other than memory chips and similar 
mass-produced items could select Russian organizations as good 
partners for the dedicated-IC design and manufacture of 
electronic-circuit portions of related products. 
  Russia produces most of the medical instruments manufactured 
by advanced foreign nations. To put it another way, it can be 
said to possess technology capable of manufacturing all medical 
instruments. Even MRI equipment (nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectrometer) is being produced and distributed. Visiting many 
medical institutions in Russia, however, one can sense the 
inferior medical instruments, the deterioration and lack of 
facilities of most of them. This reality is the result of 
Russia's overall economic difficulties. 
  It is also a result of the funding shortages experienced by 
medical institutions because the medical system is in a 
transition period, moving from free medical treatment under 
socialism to medical treatment for which a fee is charged. 
Russia's medical-instruments industry is also linked with the 
program being conducted by the government of privatizing 
military industries. 
  It is a well-known fact that Russia's aviation- and 
space-related technology is advanced. It can be called world 
class in all areas, from the design of aircraft and spacecraft 
to the design and manufacture of mechanical and electronic spare 
parts and new materials technology. However, because 
aviation-and space-related industries are run by a policy of 
large-scale investment at the national level, cooperation in 
this field generally can be achieved by state support or large 
enterprises. However, there are also fields among related 
spare-parts industries in which cooperation can be achieved by 
small and medium-sized business. 
  Laser-related technology too is closely associated with 
Russia's advanced military industry. With the program of 
conversion to civilian industry, many laser-related technologies 
are being applied in laser-using industrial instruments, medical 
instruments, laboratory instruments, etc. A phenomenon common to 
all products made in Russia, technology for the production of 
fresh commercial products is lacking. Although products are made 
using superior technology, in various ways they can be said to 
be inferior compared to the products of advanced foreign 
nations. Therefore, if this is supplemented by ROK technology, 
it has the potential for commercial success on the world market. 
  Through cooperation with Russia, the 
communications-instruments and spare-parts sectors have 
potential for making inroads into the world market, and also for 
making products for sale in Russia. In May 1993, 26 prominent, 
communications-industry companies entered Russia in the form of 
a joint venture. Russia is producing TDX (time division 
exchanges) and other telephone-switching instruments, but its 
performance is very backward compared to our ROK technology. 
Therefore, cooperation is possible on the sale or on-site 
production of ROK products. In the case of cellular-phone, 
satellite-communications, and optical-communications technology, 
however, Russia is advanced, making possible varied cooperation 
in ROK mobile-communications-related industrial sectors. 
  Other technical fields with prospects for cooperation are 
the 
processing-related sectors using nonferrous metals such as 
aluminum, copper, zinc, and nickel, sectors dealing with the 
development and application of new materials, and the 
machine-instrument sector. More detailed, useful information on 
each sector can be obtained using the relevant reference 
libraries of the Korea-Russia Science and Technological 
Cooperation Center. 
<H5>  [21 Apr 94 p 16] </H5>
  [Text] During the last three years, there has been an 
exchange between many ROK institutions (research centers, 
business, universities, etc.) and Russian institutions. They 
have used various methods of contact and exchange for absorbing 
Russian technology and applying it to the development of 
commercial products. Although some businesses have gained a 
measure of success as a result, most obtained no great results, 
failing in many cases. 
  As a result of touring various Russian research institutions 
and business up to now, the author believes that it would be 
more useful for ROK small and medium-sized businesses to adopt 
Russian technology through a cooperative relationship. The 
reason for this is that, although Russia's technological level 
is high, it has insufficient linkage of this with 
mass-production technology, so small-quantity-high-variety 
production by small and medium-sized business would be 
profitable. 
  Characteristic of Russian technology is a lack of 
systematization of mass-production technology and concepts of 
production costs. Therefore, if Russian technology is to be 
introduced and applied from product design to production, there 
is a high probability of running up against various difficulties 
and of failure. Judging Russian technology based on finished 
product alone is not a complete method either. Of course, it is 
true that if a product's performance is superior, the technology 
which made that product is superior. However, there are many 
cases in which a products technological level is superior, even 
though its performance is not. In this case, there are many 
instances in which superior-performance products were simply not 
made, rather than being impossible to make due to the 
characteristics of Russian society and the Russian economy. 
  Technological cooperation with Russia must start with these 
particular circumstances in mind. Most Russian technology is not 
directly linked to production. It is technology with no concept 
of production-cost reduction. 
  To a certain degree, ROK businesses have their own design 
and 
production technology. However, rather than cooperating in all 
technology from design to production, ROK businesses should form 
cooperative relationships with Russia after clearly selecting 
technology we need for specific fields in which it is lacking. 
Cooperative relationships can take various forms: getting 
technical training by inviting superior engineers in relevant 
fields; purchasing desired technology; development based on 
joint research (paying Russian research institutions a research 
fee, commissioning technical development); and developing 
technology by setting up joint-venture research centers in 
Russia. 
  Inviting technicians could be an effective method, depending 
on the kind of technology we need. However, because there are 
limitations on the number of technicians who can be invited and 
on the length of their stay in Korea, this would not be 
efficient in many cases. 
  Up to now there has been much technological cooperation 
between many ROK and relevant Russian institutions in the form 
of joint research. 
  Given Russia's present situation, however, this is one of 
several considerably inefficient methods. 
  Joint-ventures, in the present circumstances, are considered 
to enable decreased investment risk while allowing ROK 
businesses to adopt Russian science and technology. Not costing 
that much and an achievement of the research and development 
functions urgently desired by ROK business, the establishment of 
joint-venture research centers can be said to be ideal. 
  In special Russian circumstances, the establishment of 
joint-venture research centers can be said to be very effective 
for the following reasons. 
  First, performing research and development through joint 
investment by both sides, it is possible to carry out all 
processes through product development together with Russian 
technicians. 
  Also, if a contract is concluded so that relevant Russian 
institutions provide public facilities and laboratory equipment, 
investment risk will be reduced by minimizing research center 
set-up costs. 
  Besides this, use can be made of an excellent research 
workforce for wages lower than those of researchers at ROK 
research centers. 
  This technological development through the establishment of 
joint-venture research centers in Russia is efficient from 
various viewpoints. However, ROK companies can be said to have a 
greater probability of succeeding in research and development if 
they take the following into consideration. 
  First of all, having, to a certain degree, its own domestic 
research workforce, ROK business must lead research operations 
on site in Russia and must be able to domestically absorb the 
technology developed. ROK business must be able to handle on its 
own the commercialization process resulting from the mass 
production of this technology. 
  Also, with the concept of carrying out research and 
development, it must begin a cooperative relationship by using 
approximately 10-20 percent of funding used in the domestic 
research centers of ROK companies for research centers in Russia. 
  However, for genuine success in scientific and technological 
cooperation, it must start in the concept of mutual ROK-Russian 
interests.

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- Locomotive engineers went 
on strike Thursday morning, paralyzing railroads across the 
country. 
  Reacting to a riot police raid on the engineers' sit-in 
protests earlier in the morning, Chonkihyop, a private 
"unregistered" union of locomotive engineers, declared a general 
strike immediately after the raid, four days earlier than 
originally scheduled. 
  During the raid, the police, mobilizing over 6,000 riot 
troopers, took away 613 engineers staging sit-in demonstrations 
at 14 sites in nine cities for later detention. 
  The strike reduced railroad transportation, both passengers 
and cargo, to 11.2 percent of the normal level, the Korean 
National Railroad said. On the Seoul-Pusan line, the usual 147 
train runs a day fell to only 28. 
  The police sought arrest warrants for seven leaders of 
Chonkihyop, including Vice Chairman Pak Sang-su. 
  The Seoul Subway Workers Union threatened to join locomotive 
engineers in the strike at 4:00 AM Friday if collective 
bargaining on Thursday fails, while Chonnodae (the National 
Council of Trade Union Representatives), another dissident 
unregistered labor organization, is moving toward striking along 
with Chonkihyop. 
  Transportation Minister O Myong, saying the police raid was 
unavoidable to prevent the threatened railroad and subway 
strikes next Monday, appealed to the striking engineers to 
return to their duties. 
  Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok called an 
emergency 
economic ministers' meeting to discuss handling the railroad 
strike and the imminent Seoul subway strike. 
  Economic losses from the railroad and subway strikes are 
estimated at 2,950 million won (some 3.6 million U.S. dollars) a 
day.

  [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul subway workers went 
on strike at 4:00 AM Friday, leaving hundreds of thousands of 
commuters stranded during the morning rush hour in the capital 
area. 
  The Seoul Subway Corp. set in motion an emergency subway 
operation plan, using 295 non-striking engineers to start train 
runs at much longer intervals at 5:30 AM, 30 minutes later than 
usual. 
  The workers, sticking to their demand for a 14.5-percent 
wage 
hike, turned down the corporation's offer of a 3-percent raise, 
an informal guideline set by the government to fight inflation. 
  Railroad engineers also went on strike Thursday, nearly 
paralyzing railway transportation across the country. 
  In a related development, subway workers in Pusan, the 
country's second largest city, shelved a plan to strike Friday 
morning in sympathy with their colleagues in Seoul.

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 24 June 
carry editorials, reports, and articles on nationwide strikes by 
locomotive engineers and subway workers. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
1,100-word editorial entitled "Should the Innocent Citizens 
Suffer Pains?" Noting that the railroad is the "main artery of 
the nation and the subway is the feet of the people," the 
editorial stresses that their operation should not be suspended 
under any pretext, and that the "serious traffic disorder" 
caused by recent strikes by railroad and subway workers is 
indeed unfortunate. 
  Pointing to the "deplorable position of the people who can 
do 
nothing except watch the strike," the editorial writes that "the 
one who suffers pains and damages for the strike is none other 
than the nation and the people," not railroad and subway 
authorities or their trade unions, asking if the leadership of 
the railroad engineers and subway workers unions has ever 
thought about the "catastrophic consequences" to be brought 
about by their strike. 
  The daily stresses that the locomotive engineers trade 
union's demand for improvement of working conditions and the 
subway workers union demand for a 15.4 percent wage increase 
does not justify such a drastic act which "restricts the 
national economy and binds the citizens' feet." The editorial 
points out that the railroad and subway are different from 
private enterprises, and moreover, railroad engineers are public 
service personnel, and the law prohibits their strike and 
"sabotage." The paper denounces their hasty strike as an act of 
driving the nation and the people into "a bog of confusion." 
The editorial emphasizes that the people do not think that "the 
demand of unionized subway workers is urgent nor has 
justification and that their strike cannot evade condemnation by 
the citizens as an act of betrayal." The paper writes that the 
railroad and subway are "possessions of the nation and the 
people," not of the government or the trade unions. The 
editorial concludes by stressing that "it is a most urgent task, 
which should be resolved before anything else, to normalize the 
operation of the railroad and subway." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
3,000-word editorial, under the headline, "Who Has Stopped the 
Train?--The Government's Hardline Measures Cause Catastrophe." 
  The editorial points out that the "serious traffic disorder" 
caused by the suspension of train and subway operation is "the 
result of the government's wholesale roundup of striking 
locomotive engineers" in a bid to prevent the strike of railroad 
and subway workers slated for 27 June, defining this step as 
"the worst choice" among measures for resolving the 
labor-management dispute. Thus, the editorial writes, the very 
"ringleader" who caused a catastrophe is none other than the 
government, and the government's step even violates the law, 
because the workers taken to the police did not refuse routine 
daily work nor did they disturb normal operations. Branding the 
government's arrest of the leaders of the workers in strike as 
an "excessive step," the editorial observes that the strike was 
prompted by "outdated labor management and the policy of 
unreasonable repression of wages" by the railroad authorities 
and that the workers' demand reflects the urgency in their 
working condition and everyday life. The paper then notes that 
the demands of workers in the past were "ignored and refused" by 
the authorities, who are the users of workers. 
  The editorial stresses that the government should have shown 
"a sincere attitude" to make its best efforts for a satisfactory 
solution of the dispute instead of shifting the responsibility 
to the workers. The paper then calls on the government to 
release all arrested workers and to provide the union leaders 
with the opportunity to participate in negotiations with the 
government for a solution to the dispute. While urging the 
workers' side to show a sincere attitude for a solution of the 
situation if the government puts forward concrete measures, the 
editorial calls on the press to make a fair and impartial 
report. The paper urges the people "not to condemn only the 
workers' side but patiently endure personal inconveniences and 
wait for the satisfactory settlement of the situation." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 30 a 1,000-word 
article by reporters Son Yong-kyu and Pak Chon-ho on citizen 
reaction to the railroad and subway workers strike: 
  Chang Chun-su (age 36, businessmen living in Puyong 
Apartment 
Complex in Pyongchon, Kyonggi Province): Trade union workers 
should not victimize the citizens' everyday life to accomplish 
their demands. The attempt of some workers to sacrifice all the 
people for the interest of some trade union workers should not 
be pardoned. 
  Yu Hui-su (40, business company employee): The attitude of 
the locomotive engineers trade union to accomplish their will by 
binding the citizens' feet is erroneous. The government is also 
responsible for failing to prevent the paralysis of the national 
economy. Both sides should show the will for a satisfactory 
solution to their dispute at an early date. 
  So Kyong-sok (member of the National Federation for Economic 
Justice): Drastic actions causing acute confrontation are 
always a problem. The illegal strike by railroad workers can 
hardly win the support of the people. A matured attitude for a 
solution through dialogue and negotiations is urged. 
  Kim Song-su (40, public service official): Both sides should 
show an attitude of making concessions. The government should 
also show a more sincere attitude for negotiation with workers. 
The citizens' unrest is increasing for the strike, in addition 
to the North Korean nuclear issue.

  [Text] The National Railroad Administration [NRA] decided 
to deprive locomotive engineers who belong to the National 
Council of Locomotive Engineers of their public service official 
status if they do not report to work by 1000 AM on 25 June, 
considering that they have no intention to work for the railroad 
any longer if they do not return to work by that time. 
  Some railroad workers left their work sites and as a result, 
railroad operations have been repeatedly crippled, thus causing 
confusion in society and to the national economy. In view of 
the fact that this has a serious impact on overall national 
affairs, the NRA issued "an emergency service directive" on the 
morning of 24 June, and made a decision for such deprivation. 
  The NRA has estimated that the number of workers who belong 
to the council and will not return to work by the deadline will 
reach approximately 400. 
  [The newspaper adds in another article, that the NRA reports 
trains are operating at 12 percent capacity as of the morning of 
24 June.]

  [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- The National Conference 
of Union Representatives (Chonnodae) threatened on Friday to 
enter general strikes at major industries across the country 
unless the government sets free arrested train operators and 
meets other union demands promptly. 
  In a press conference at the social service hall of Sungsil 
University, Chonnodae leaders said that if their demand goes 
unheeded, the unions of about 100 industries would go on general 
strikes beginning next Monday. 
  The strikes will begin at some 30 firms including Hyundai 
Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery 
Co. where unionists have already voted for strikes. 
  The Chonnodae leaders claimed that the use of police force 
against the striking train operators early Friday morning was 
"an express illegal action." 
  They then demanded the immediate resignation of Home 
Minister 
Choe Hyong-u, release of arrested train operators and 
recognition of Train Operators Union (Chonkihyop) as an official 
dialogue conduit. 
  The Train Operators Union (Chonkihyop), too, vowed on Friday 
to carry on their strike unless the police release all the 
persons arrested and apologize for use of police force against 
their striking unionists. 
  Choe Chi-hwan of the union told reporters at the Christian 
Hall at Yonji-tong that his union, however, asked the Korean 
National Council of Churches (KNCC) to mediate between them and 
the government based on their demands. 
  Meanwhile, the Seoul Subway Corp. reacted furiously against 
subway workers' strike on Friday, suing 41 unionists actively 
involved on charges of violating the law on labor disputes. 
  The Corp. also relieved 24 leading union officials of their 
duties. 
  Corp. President Han Chin-hi warned that striking workers 
should report to work by 11 A.M. Saturday or face disciplinary 
actions including dismissal.

  [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok on Friday said the government would make multi-pronged 
efforts to elevate workers' interests, but warned that it would 
not tolerate unlawful strikes under any circumstances. 
  In a statement issued on the railroad and subway workers' 
strikes, Yi said his government would not compromise with 
unlawfulness and sternly deal with the incident if only for the 
civilian-led government to fulfill its duty to promote 
democratization. 
  The statement was made soon after he presided over an 
emergency ministers meeting at the Sejong-ro government building. 
  The prime minister said in the statement that the railroad 
workers' strike was illegal since, he said, it was staged by 
those who are public officials in status and who, therefore, 
have no right to collective actions. 
  Saying that split and confrontation within the country serve 
no national interests, Yi said the government would sincerely 
try to improve working conditions if striking workers regain 
reason and return to normal work.

  [Text] Kwangju, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The South Cholla 
Province police here on Thursday afternoon ceased to ferret out 
the Namchongnyon students involved in the recent violence and 
withdrew riot police from numerous road check points in the 
outlying areas of Kwangju. 
  The police had been rounding up those students actively 
involved in the commandeering of a passenger train near here and 
subsequent violent clashes with police in Seoul over the weekend. 
  So far, 185 students were caught, of whom 38 were placed 
under arrest and 25 others booked without physical restraint. 
Nine were still being questioned and 113 were set free, a 
police source said. 
  The stoppage of the police action came hours after a group 
of 
civic leaders in Kwangju called at both the police and the 
Namchongnyon student organization. 
  Meeting with South Cholla Police Commissioner An Pyong-uk at 
his police office, the civic leaders asked him to refrain from 
using his police force excessively. 
  Also calling on Namchongnyon Chairman Yang Tong-hun at 
Choson 
University, they stressed that apart from the cause of the 
recent incident, it would be proper for his organization to 
admit to mistakes displayed in the course. 
  The nine met over breakfast Thursday morning and decided to 
mediate between the police and students. They included Profs. 
Myong No-kun and Yi Kwang-u of Chonnam University, Lawyer Yi 
Ki-hong and Catholic Father Cho Pius.

<F P=106> [Article by reporters Yi Chang-won, Kwon Kyong-on, and Pak </F>
Sun-uk: "National Federation of University Student Councils 
Plans To Send Delegation to Pyongyang"] 
  [Excerpts] Following the forcible stoppage of trains and 
radical demonstrations by the Federation of University Student 
Councils in Kwangju and South Cholla Province Area 
[Namchongnyon], the National Federation of University Student 
Councils [Hanchongnyon] is pushing ahead to send its delegation 
to Pyongyang. This is timed to coincide with discussion of 
holding a North-South summit and with the North Korean side's 
pushing for a "15 August pannational meeting" as part of its 
united front strategy. If Hanchongnyon sends a delegation to 
Pyongyang, it will cause considerable disturbances to 
North-South relations. 
  Hanchongnyon (chairman Kim Hyon-chun, president of General 
Student Association of Pusan University) on 22 June announced 
that "Hanchongnyon has been preparing to dispatch a delegation 
to North Korea for two months in compliance with the proposal of 
the joint secretariat in Berlin of the Pannational Alliance of 
Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification 
[Pomchonghangnyon]." Hanchongnyon also revealed that "since the 
atmosphere for a North-South summit has ripened recently, the 
decision to push for dispatching a delegation has been discussed 
cautiously." It was learned that Hanchongnyon has discussed 
in-depth the cancellation of sending its delegation to North 
Korea in consideration of the situation, which has changed 
significantly from last April, and criticism that its 
delegation's North Korean visit might possibly hinder the 
realization of a North-South summit. 
  Hanchongnyon revealed that in the event that it finally 
decides to send a delegation to the North, it will dispatch Choe 
Chang-nam (25, co-secretary of Pomchonghangnyon and a Seoul 
National University student temporarily out of school) to North 
Korea to call for the holding of a North-South summit at an 
early date through talks with President Kim Il-song. As agenda 
items for the summit, he will propose an early settlement of the 
nuclear problem, methods for national reunification, and 
formulation of a North-South commonwealth before the 
reunification. Hanchongnyon is also pushing ahead with talks 
between Kim Hyon-chun, Hanchongnyon's chairman sought by the 
police, and President Kim Yong-sam, in which Kim Hyong-chu will 
explain positions of Hanchongnyon to the president. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to material from the prosecutor's office, 
Pomchonghangnyon, where Choe Chang-nam is working as its 
co-secretary, has three headquarters, including the South side's 
headquarters, the North side's headquarters, and overseas 
headquarters. Each headquarters has a congress (composed of 200 
members); central committee (25 members), and joint secretariat 
(5 members). The secretariat of Pomchonghangnyon is made up of 
Pak Song-hui and Song Yong-song, the South side's delegates who 
visited North Korea in 1991; Choe Kyong-chol, the North side's 
delegate; and Cho Son-o and Hwang Yong-chi, delegates from 
overseas headquarters who are living in Japan. Realizing that 
the Pak Song-hui--Song Yong-song team is too weak, Hanchongnyon 
additionally dispatched Choe Chang-nam to the secretariat. 
  A relevant official from the prosecutor's office revealed 
that Pomchonghangnyon planned to hold a congress in Pyongyang 
from 27 to 29 May, timed with Hanchongnyon's inauguration 
ceremony, and to dispatch Choe Chang-nam to the North as the 
South side's delegate. However, in the wake of Hanchongnyon's 
inauguration ceremony, public law enforcement authorities 
blocked Hanchongnyon's contact with the North side through 
telephone and facsimile, and raised Hanchongnyon's nature as 
benefiting the enemy. As a result, there is an unfavorable 
attitude toward Hanchongnyon, and its congress has been 
postponed until 15 August. 
  Choe Chang-nam left for Berlin without informing his parents 
and friends and sent a letter to his parents in Kwangju on 4 
November 1993, writing that "he will grandly launch the work for 
national reunification," and informed them of his recent 
activities, writing that "he is attending an educational 
institute with Song Yong-sung to learn German." 
  Hearing about his son's visit to North Korea, Kim Si-u (58), 
Choe's mother, said absent-mindedly that "all this would not 
have happened if he did not go to the college. I hope he comes 
home safely without visiting the North."

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The government is holding 
consultations among relevant ministries to raise next year's pay 
for civil servants by 6 percent to 7 percent. 
  The Economic Planning Board [EPB] said Thursday that the 
government has already begun detailed calculations to hike 
public employees' salaries next year at a rate similar to this 
year's 6.2 percent. 
  In addition to the pay rise, the government is considering 
increasing the number of primary and secondary school teachers, 
judges and prosecutors slightly. It is also considering a 
differential payment of managerial job allowances, which are now 
uniformly paid to officials of grade four and above, so that 
those doing a good job would receive better treatment. 
  This year's salary for civil servants is 90 percent of that 
for state-run businesses and the government may push its 
employees' salaries up to 94 percent next year and 97 percent in 
1996. From 1997, pay for officials would be the same as that at 
state-run enterprises, according to an EPB official. 
  Meanwhile, the government will freeze the total number of 
employees next year under its principle of "small government," 
except that it will newly employ 2,000 more school teachers and 
50 additional judges and prosecutors.

  [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The government decided to 
lift all financial restrictions on the Hyundai Business Group 
Thursday, one day after President Kim Yong-sam's pronouncement 
that no businessmen should suffer from factors unrelated to the 
economy, according to government sources. 
  The government decided to allow Hyundai to issue Deposit 
Receipts (DR) abroad and to receive loans for the expansion of 
production facilities from the Korea Development Bank (KDB) as 
soon as possible, the sources said. 
  The government had already accepted applications Tuesday 
from 
three Hyundai subsidiaries -- Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai 
Housing and Industrial Development and Hyundai Elevator -- for 
registration on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. 
  Five Hyundai subsidiaries, including Hyundai Merchant 
Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development, that have already 
applied for OTC registration will be treated the same as other 
firms if they seek listing on the stock market, said the sources. 
  Hyundai will be allowed to float deposit receipts abroad 
during the fourth quarter because the Korea Securities Dealers' 
Association has already given the go-ahead to companies issuing 
DRs in the third quarter, they said. 
  Hyundai will also be entitled to receive KDB loans during 
the 
year because the KDB accepts loan applications at any time, they 
said. 
  President Kim had announced at a meeting of businessmen 
Wednesday that no business should be subjected to favors or 
disadvantages for political reasons, hinting at the lifting of 
all restrictions on Hyundai. 
  Hyundai has reportedly faced great difficulty in proceeding 
with various projects after the government imposed financial 
sanctions on the nation's largest business group in the 
aftermath of honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong's run for the 
presidency in the 1992 election.

  [Text] Burmese students at the Ban Maniloi centre in 
Ratchaburi face a possible ban from leaving the centre during 
the ASEAN ministerial meeting in Bangkok next month to prevent 
them from protesting the presence of members of Burma's ruling 
junta. 
  Representatives of Burma's State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC) have been invited to attend the opening and 
closing ceremonies plus a banquet held during the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations meeting. 
  The invitation has prompted international condemnation of 
Thailand's role as host country. 
  Deputy Permanent Secretary for the Interior Chaloem 
Phromloet 
said yesterday he trusted Ratchaburi Governor Kamlunthep 
Thewakun would know what steps to take to prevent possible 
problems caused by Burmese students from the centre joining the 
protest. 
  "He knows well how to deal with this type of incident since 
he was with the ministry's internal security section before 
becoming a provincial governor," said Mr Chaloem. 
  He said any protesters who try to disrupt the meeting would 
be dealt with sternly by police. 
  M.R. Kamlunthep said: "If I forbid the Burmese students from 
leaving Ban Maniloi, I will be accused of violating their human 
rights. Yet somehow I will have to come up with a solution." 
  He said he would hold talks with Mr Chaloem on the 
possibility of the Burmese students staging a protest. 
  "The students at the centre have lately had problems with 
villagers in the neighbourhood," he said referring to troubles 
in the last month. "Even if these students are refugees in our 
country, that cannot be used as an excuse not to abide by the 
law. 
  "Any person who violates the law in this country will have 
to 
face the legal consequences." 
  The Interior Ministry's Information and Foreign Affairs 
Division director, Praphakon Samiti, said any Ban Maniloi 
students joining a protest which disrupts the ASEAN meeting will 
be arrested and detained at a centre in Bang Khen. 
  They will lose their refugee status and will simply be 
regarded as illegal immigrants and dealt with as such by the 
police, he said. 
  "Present media reports indicate the students from the centre 
are not part of the group planning a protest," he said. 
  But Mr Praphakon said there were efforts by certain Burmese 
dissidents to encourage the students to join them in the protest. 
  "The students at the centre know they will go to jail and 
will not be allowed to return to Ban Maniloi if they join the 
protest." 
  He said he did not understand why anyone wanted to protest 
SLORC's presence at the meeting since their participation was 
only ceremonial.

  [Text] As reported earlier, American and Vietnamese experts 
Thursday began the 30th joint search for MIA's as diplomatic 
thaw between the two countries begins to triumph over postwar 
disputes. Here is our radio comment on this event: 
  The MIA Office in Hanoi said: A total of 102 U.S. experts 
will take part in the operation, which will run until 19 July, 
covering 27 northern, central, and southern provinces of 
Vietnam. One hundred Vietnamese will join the eight search 
teams, five of which will excavate U.S. Air Force crash sites, 
while the three others make interviews with the local population. 
  By its concrete deeds, Vietnam has always proved its 
goodwill 
in solving the MIA issue. It has many a time confirmed that the 
MIA issue is a pure humanitarian question. Vietnam has done and 
will do its best to cooperate with the U.S. in solving the MIA 
issue. It is suitable to Vietnam's humanitarian tradition. 
  In 1993, the two countries also gained encouraging results 
in 
solving this question. Vietnam has handed over to the U.S. side 
580 sets of remains of the American servicemen, and joint expert 
teams of both sides have conducted three searches in northern, 
central, and southern provinces of Vietnam. Colonel of the U.S. 
Marines Mr. (John Brennon), head of the MIA Office in Hanoi, 
said thanks to Vietnam's effective cooperation and support, they 
have achieved encouraging results in solving MIA issue. 
Especially in late 1993, for the first time, Vietnam and Laos 
cooperated with the U.S. to conduct searches in areas between 
Vietnam and Laos border. 
  Recent developments prove that the past has been closed and 
the relations between the two countries has been developing 
positively, creating favorable conditions for the solution of 
the MIA issue. Vietnam remains cooperative with the U.S. to 
effectively solve this issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Japan's ruling coalition 
parties resumed talks Friday with the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) in an attempt to woo the second largest opposition force 
back into the fold in the face of a no-confidence vote being 
sought by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  "Who is going to resign en masse? Nothing has been decided 
yet," Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Friday morning in 
response to reporters' questions about the SDP's demand for the 
voluntary dissolution of his cabinet. 
  Hata on Thursday indicated he is ready to resign with his 
ministers if it is necessary to bring the SDP back. The SDP 
left the coalition in April, giving rise to the nation's first 
minority government in four decades. 
  Earlier the same day, the main opposition LDP, ousted from 
power last August by a reformist coalition after 38 years of 
rule, submitted the no-confidence motion against the Hata 
government. 
  The SDP, which has the swinging vote, has said it may join 
in 
the motion if the realliance talks collapse. 
  The fresh round of talks between coalition partners, led by 
Hata's Shinseito, and the SDP was focused on plans to raise the 
3 percent consumption tax to cover income tax cuts, welfare 
funding and other key financial needs. 
  The SDP, which opposed the consumption tax when it was 
introduced in 1989, is demanding it be replaced with other forms 
of indirect taxation. 
  Hata met with SDP head Tomiichi Murayama for less than half 
an hour Thursday night in an unsuccessful attempt to tide over 
the political crisis, leaving the fate of the government to 
further talks between their top aides. 
  Whether the two leaders will have another meeting Friday 
"will depend on progress on various things," Hata said as he 
headed for the day's cabinet meeting. 
  Murayama told a meeting Friday morning of the party's 
central 
executive committee that he will seek to settle the stalemate 
within the day. 
  Referring to the no-confidence motion, Murayama said a 
plenary session of the House of Representatives, if convened, 
must give priority to a vote on the motion but that the steering 
committee's decision to call a full-house session depends on the 
day's developments on the political front. 
  In a related development, the SDP rejected the LDP's offer 
Thursday to hold coalition talks, saying the socialists are 
consulting the governing parties on their possible return to the 
coalition camp.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties will reject a demand by the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] that Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata immediately disband his cabinet to 
reconcile with the SDP, a former member of the ruling bloc, 
coalition sources said Friday [24 June]. 
  The sources said leaders of the coalition partners met and 
reached a consensus that there is no reason for the Hata cabinet 
to resign en masse. 
  At the meeting, the minority alliance decided on policy 
proposals for a new government to be proposed to other parties 
not including the SDP, they said. 
  During talks on Friday afternoon with the ruling coalition 
parties, the SDP once again called for the Hata cabinet's 
resignation, the sources said. The coalition parties said they 
will discuss the SDP request among themselves, they said. 
  The minority coalition and the SDP are meeting in an attempt 
to woo the second largest opposition force back into the fold in 
the face of a no-confidence vote being sought by the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Hata on Thursday hinted that he is ready to resign with his 
ministers if it is necessary to bring the SDP back into the 
fold. The SDP left the coalition in April, giving risevernment

<F P=106> [By reporter Choe Won-ki] </F>
  [Text] At the preliminary contact to be made at Panmunjom 
on 28 June, the government is going to propose that the summit 
talks be held "in Seoul on around 10 July," while putting forth 
agenda items on which both the South and North can easily reach 
an agreement. 
  According to government officials concerned, the government 
will propose to the North side that the summit talks be realized 
in Seoul on around 10 July. 
  This is based on the judgment that it is good for the 
South-North summit talks to be realized right before or after 8 
July--the date when the North-U.S. talks are expected to be 
held--because the two kinds of talks should go in tandem with 
each other. 
  The government is going to propose Seoul as the venue with 
the expectations that if President Kim Il-song has the 
opportunity to have the firsthand look at, and feel from, the 
South Korean society, the atmosphere for the summit talks will 
change. 
  Meanwhile, the government is planning to have all 
things--which the South and North can raise--included in the 
agenda items. At the same time, the government will give 
priority to those loose items on which the South and North can 
easily reach an agreement so that the atmosphere for the talks 
may not become rigid. 
  Saying this regarding the agenda for the summit talks, one 
government official concerned said that such items will be 
reflecting the spirit and substance of the South-North Basic 
Agreement. He said on 24 June: "The government needs a loose 
agenda even for a joint statement to be released by the South 
and North right after the summit talks. The agenda items for 
the summit talks can smoothly be simplified in the process of 
keynote speeches by the head delegates to the preliminary 
contacts and of follow-up negotiations." 
  In his keynote speech, Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister for 
national unification affairs, is going to clarify our position 
on the South-North joint declaration of denuclearization; the 
implementation of the South-North Basic Agreement; dispersed 
families; and economic cooperation between the South and North.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Absolute for Jakarta"] </F>
  [Text] The Indonesian authorities' ban on three magazines, 
and the demonstrations of support for the media this has 
brought, have presented the government with a tricky question: 
just what was the campaign of political openness signalled by 
President Suharto four years ago meant to achieve? Broadly 
speaking, it was to create the conditions for economic 
upliftment and the modernisation of society. Just last week, 
State Secretary Murdiono told a seminar that any political 
system had to be dynamic and open to change in accordance with 
new demands and conditions. "The global political trend demands 
greater political openness and greater respect for human 
rights," he had said. All that is worthwhile. For the country to 
advance, it takes more than opening up the economy to foreign 
participation. Domestic strengths need to be maximised. It can 
be no surprise then that a liberalisation of the spirit has 
brought with it an exuberance among activists that can come 
uncomfortably close to upsetting public order. Recent events 
have been revealing. If they spin out of control, the 
consequences can be dire as Indonesian society in urban centres 
remains a combustible mix of extreme wealth and unfulfilled 
wants. It lacks the buffer of a growing middle class found in 
Taiwan and South Korea when these countries began to ease off on 
societal restrictions less than a decade ago. If not managed 
properly, it could deal Indonesia's cause of openness a blow 
which would take years to repair. That equally would be harmful 
to an emancipating society. 
  The Medan labour riots over minimum pay were bad enough, but 
they began to take on a racial complexion with the discovery of 
anti-Chinese leaflets. Then came the Bapindo corruption case, 
which has dramatised for many Indonesians to hold the Chinese 
have on the economy and their friends in high places. Earlier, 
the virulence of student agitation over a state-sponsored 
lottery had warned the security agencies of the dangers of 
pent-up emotions being released suddenly. In a separate case, 
the sentencing of 21 students for defaming the president brought 
home to many the power of pressure groups. 
  These are internal dynamics. Recent remarks by two key 
generals leave one in doubt that the authorities are alive to 
the dangers. This is a comfort to Indonesia's neighbours who 
share its concern for internal stability to drive economic 
expansion. Gen. Feisal Tanjung, head of the armed forces, 
cautioned last month that political dialogue had to come with a 
sense of responsibility and consensus to "take into account our 
cultural condition". Brig-Gen Agum Gumelar, head of the Kopassus 
[Special Commando Force] force which aided the crushing of the 
communist forces after the abortive 1965 coup by the PKI, the 
Indonesian Communist Party, has warned of the communist revival. 
In today's context, that could be taken as a code for the 
radical groups -- student and labour activists, 
environmentalists and human rights advocates -- which some 
quarters see as troublesome. 
  Here, the hope must be that just as it is vital to secure 
public order, care must be taken that debate and legitimate 
expressions of grievance are not snuffed out. Such a development 
would ill-serve Indonesia. The difficulty, as is standard when 
discussing a polity as complex as Indonesia's, is in making the 
ground rules for participatory democracy as clear as can be. 
Complicating the equation is the internal dimension. Indonesia 
is the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, and it has hopes 
for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. 
In November, it will stage the second summit of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation members. Wanting to be a player on the 
world stage carries with it obligations, such as adherence to 
certain standards of behaviour, which may be at odds with what 
has been happening at home. But domestic stability is paramount 
-- this is an absolute to preserve conditions for uninterrupted 
growth in Southeast Asia.

  [Excerpt] Speaking to newsmen at Bina Graha [presidential 
office] in Jakarta today, Murdiono, minister/state secretary, 
said Indonesia feels that Japanese politics is mature enough 
that the change in its premiership will not affect the previous 
government's commitment. 
  Murdiono expressed shock upon hearing the news of Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to undertake the mass 
resignation of his cabinet. However, he said that what is 
important to Indonesia is to see that the new Japanese 
Government's national policies remain the same. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 24 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The Indonesian 
Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed deep regret over the plan 
of the Malaysian Non-governmental Organizations (NGO's) to 
conduct a forum on East Timor. 
  "The holding of such a forum will definitely damage the 
solidarity and good relations between Indonesia and Malaysia as 
both are members of the ASEAN," Foreign Ministry Information 
Director, Irawan Abidin, told ANTARA. 
  A transnational news agency said that the Malaysia Action 
Front, a group comprising 30 NGOs, is organizing an East Timor 
forum late Friday. 
  "A good number of people were invited to attend the two and 
a 
half hour forum. But it is different from the one held recently 
in Manila which was conducted on a large international scale," 
Syed Hussain Ali, who would be one of the speakers at the forum, 
quoted by AFP as saying. 
  Irawan Abidin said he is still waiting for a detailed report 
regarding such planned forum from the Indonesian Embassy in 
Kuala Lumpur. 
  "But, I believe that it is just a "disinformation campaign" 
from certain groups to test Indonesia's reaction," he said.

  [Text] Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid, Chief of ABRI's 
[Indonesian Armed Forces] Information Center, told newsmen in 
Jakarta today that ABRI shares the opinion of the Indonesian 
Foreign Department in regretting the plan by Malaysian 
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) to conduct a forum on 
East Timor. 
  He said that if the forum in Malaysia is allowed to proceed, 
the solidarity and good relations between Indonesia and Malaysia 
will be negatively affected. 
  The Indonesian Government hopes that the Malaysian 
Government 
will adopt the same attitude as that of the Philippine 
Government, whereby a planned forum on East Timor was canceled. 
  The ABRI Information Center chief feels that the forum to be 
held in Malaysia can tarnish the good reputation of the 
Indonesian Government, particularly the ABRI.

  [Text] President Suharto received Golkar party participants 
at a technical workshop sponsored by the Fisheries and 
Agriculture Department in Tapos, Bogor yesterday. He said 
Indonesia should work hard during the upcoming Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation, APEC, summit so Indonesia and the other 
developing nations will benefit from decisions reached by the 
developed nations at that summit. 
  He also stated that Indonesia will not make superfluous 
requests during the upcoming APEC summit because Indonesia and 
the other developing nations have never suffered any losses as a 
result of the decisions taken by the developed nations. 
President Suharto, however, cited an example where the recent 
decisions taken by the developed nations caused the appreciation 
of the Japanese yen. Indonesia did not benefit from that 
decision because it now has to eke out an additional U.S.$2 
billion for its loan repayments as a result of the yen 
appreciation. 
  The upcoming APEC summit, which is scheduled to be held in 
Bogor in the middle of November, is considered appropriate for 
Indonesia because it will involve developed industrial countries 
and their developing counterparts. 
  Speaking during a dialogue session with Golkar party 
participants to the workshop session, the head of state said 
that Golkar need not make any request for added funds for 
state-owned agencies. According to President Suharto, the party 
has sufficient funds in state-owned agencies, which range from 
one to 15 percent, meant for small-scale entrepreneurs.

  [Text] President Suharto says Indonesia must work hard 
during the upcoming APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] 
meeting to ensure that the future policies of developed nations 
will no longer harm the interests of Indonesia and other 
developing nations. The head of state said this when he 
received delegates attending a working technical meeting of the 
Department of Farming and Fishery of the Functional Group at the 
Tapos Ranch in Bogor today. He said the current policies of 
developed nations have often harmed the interests of Indonesia 
and other developing nations. For example, Japan continues to 
increase the value of its yen. President Suharto reiterated the 
paramount importance of the economic development of developing 
nations. Indonesia manages to achieve a seven-percent economic 
growth and keep inflation below 10 percent annually. Indonesia 
considers the APEC meeting, which will take place in Bogor in 
November, an appropriate forum because industrialized and 
developing nations will be represented there.

  [Excerpts] ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] officers will no 
longer have U.S.-oriented education, and they will have to study 
somewhere else. Where will they receive their training? 
"Australia," said one source at the ABRI headquarters. 
"Australia is not only closer, but it also offers more areas of 
studies," added the source. 
  The efforts to shift the officers' education to the 
continent 
of kangaroos are made in anticipation of the U.S. Congress' 
move. Last month, the U.S. Congress endorsed a clause in its 
Foreign Assistance bill stipulating that ABRI officers will not 
be allowed to attend U.S. military academies. This means that 
if the bill becomes law, ABRI officers will no longer be allowed 
to study in the country with the most powerful armed forces in 
the world. The ABRI has sent its officers to the United States 
since the 1950's. 
  The trouble started with the outbreak of the 12 November 
1991 
Dili incident. Following the incident, the U.S. Government 
decided to stop the International Military Education and 
Training [five preceding words in English] program for 
Indonesia. Before that, the U.S. Government spent 4.5 billion 
rupiah annually to pay the scholarships for ABRI officers 
studying there. [passage omitted] 
  Navy Commodore Yuswaji, chief of the Defense and Security 
Department's Public Relations and Foreign Relations Bureau, said 
that there are alternative countries to send ABRI officers for 
training. "If we cannot study in the United States, there are 
other countries like Australia and Britain," he said. 
  Is military training in the United States better? A 
high-ranking officer said military training in Australia is 
adequate because overseas training is basically aimed at 
widening one's horizon and doing comparative studies. "The pure 
military science taught in the United States is hard to be 
applied here because they use sophisticated military equipment," 
said the officer, who has studied in the United States several 
times.

  [Text] Jakarta 10 Jun -- Commenting on the additional 
World Bank loan of U.S. $101.5 million to Indonesia, Saleh 
Afiff, coordinating minister for economics, finance and 
supervision of national development, told newsmen that Indonesia 
still needs foreign aid to sustain its 6.2 percent economic 
growth. However, the government's total foreign debt of U.S. 
$93 billion has now reached a psychological level. In view of 
that, Indonesia has to manage its foreign loans carefully. 
  The World Bank loan will be used as an additional fund to 
upgrade 1,620 kilometers of road and maintain 6,000 kilometers 
of roads in 27 districts. 
  Mr Saleh admits that to date, Indonesia's foreign debt has 
almost reached a psychological level with the figure approaching 
U.S. $100 billion. "The people will be shocked to hear that our 
foreign debt has reached U.S. $100 billion. Likewise, if the 
inflation rate is above 10 percent, the people will be 
psychologically affected and will be worried", he said. 
  Even if it is so, the most important thing is to have the 
ability and willingness to repay the foreign debt. Indonesia is 
committed to debt repayment and will not ask for its 
installments to be rescheduled. 
  After signing an agreement for an agricultural loan with the 
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), Finance 
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said there is no need to make a fuss 
over the rise in foreign debt. This is because repayments are 
not only being made by the government. Projects that utilize 
the loans will also have to contribute to the repayments, which 
is being done in installments. He explained that foreign loans 
have been handed over to the government because the World Bank 
only gives loans to a single borrower. 
  Continuing, Afiff said that there are three types of loans 
being extended to the government. They are: soft loans payable 
under a long-term period under the coordination of the CGI 
[Consultative Group on Indonesia], export credit, and foreign 
commercial loans (PKLN). "What we require is the soft loans, 
considering that the conditions attached are not very strict," 
he added. 
  On the other hand, Indonesia has to be very careful about 
its 
foreign commercial loans, especially now that the total has 
reached 40 percent out of the U.S. $93 billion debt. "We have 
to act cautiously and not add to the huge amount of PKLN loans. 
However, we still need such loans to ease the government's 
burden of financing development projects," he said. 
  He said that the debt service ratio [three preceding words 
in 
English] (DSR) is the yardstick for measuring the safe limits of 
a nation's foreign debt. Currently, the state's DSR, including 
that of the private sector's has reached 30 percent. 
  Minister Afiff expressed the hope that the foreign 
commercial 
loans team will do a good job in preventing the private sector 
from using the government's name to take advantage of the 
foreign commercial loan facilities. 
  Responding to the World Bank's prediction that Indonesia's 
economic growth during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan 
[Repelita VI] will reach at least eight percent annually if 
bureaucratic constraints on the economy are limited, Afiff said 
that would be rather difficult. He said based on the present 
conditions, it would be hard to achieve such high economic 
growth. 
  "We will be satisfied if we achieve a 6.5 percent growth 
under the Repelita VI. This exceeds the 6.2 percent target," he 
said. 
  According to the coordinating minister, to achieve such high 
economic growth, there must be efficiency in both the 
bureaucracy as well as state-owned firms. As Indonesia's growth 
is fragile, the economic machinery will overheat if growth is 
rapid, he said. He added that the conditions that contribute to 
an overheated economy are the oversupply of money, an increase 
in the current account deficit, as well as other related factors. 
  He said the fragile economic growth is due to the decline in 
the export on non-oil and non-gas commodities, the fluctuation 
of oil prices, and also strong pressure from the foreign debt 
problem. "If the government can control the macroeconomy, rapid 
growth will not result in the overheating of the economy," he 
said.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, June 27 (AFP) -- Baton-wielding police 
and soldiers violently broke up a demonstration Monday involving 
some 300 demonstrators protesting the Indonesian Government's 
suspension of three popular weekly newspapers. 
  At least 10 people were arrested and at least several were 
injured and bleeding after being struck by security personnel in 
a main street here, witnesses said. 
  Police said there were only four arrests, however. 
  Hundreds of police in anti-riot gear and soldiers in combat 
fatigues and black T-shirts with "Operation Cleansing 1994" 
written on them descended on the demonstrators as they marched 
toward the Information Ministry. 
  Many of the marchers were seen being beaten and kicked. 
  The head of the Central Jakarta police station, 
Lieutenant-Colonel Dadang Garnida, said at the site of the 
protest that security personnel had no choice but to use "force" 
because the demonstrators ignored their demand to disperse. 
  The demonstrators -- students, human rights activists and 
journalists -- held similar protests in front of the information 
ministry on the three previous days after the government revoked 
the licences of three popular weekly newspapers last Tuesday. 
[passage omitted covered by previously filed items] 
  About two kilometres (a mile) away from the site of the 
demonstration, a group of 150 pro-government supporters 
favouring the ban on the weeklies gathered for about 45 minutes 
before dispersing peacefully, witnesses said. 
  At the same time, lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution of the Legal 
Aid Foundation, a human rights organisation, was supposed to 
lead representatives of three weeklies to new talks with 
Information Ministry officials. A first meeting, with 
Director-General Subrata, took place Thursday. 
  Nasution warned earlier that protests against the ban would 
spread across Indonesia unless it was lifted.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, June 27 (AFP) -- Baton-wielding police 
and soldiers violently broke up two demonstrations Monday 
against the government's suspension of three popular weekly 
newspapers, just ahead of Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating's arrival. 
  At least 23 people were arrested and at least several were 
injured and bleeding after being struck by security personnel, 
witnesses said. 
  Police said there were only four arrests, however, in what 
was the toughest crackdown on demonstrators here in a week 
marked by growing unrest in Indonesia over the press crackdown. 
  For the first time, banners carried by the protesters said 
Information Minister Harmoko should resign if the ban was not 
lifted. 
  Political sources here said the government was concerned 
that 
Keating might cause embarassment to Indonesia's leadership by 
raising the question of the press clampdown with President 
Suharto. [passage omitted] 
  The head of the Jakarta police, Major General Hindarto, said 
long-standing Indonesian law prohibited the gathering of more 
than five people under such circumstances. 
  A short time later, soldiers dispersed another group of 
about 
150 artists led by the well-known artist Rendra, who were 
protesting the ban on the weeklies in a park near the 
Information Ministry. 
  The security officials chased down the demonstrators and 
destroyed their banners less than one minute after ordering the 
crowd to disperse. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Press, Regulation, and Their Inclinations"] </F>
  [Text] Let us take the opportunity to touch on government 
regulation No. 20/1994 on Shareholdings in Foreign Investment 
Companies. Let us specifically examine several facts about the 
process of formulating a law on the national press and its 
existence in the country. 
  Recently, following his meeting with President Suharto, 
Information Minister Harmoko said that the issue of opening the 
media industry to foreign capital is in reference to Press Law 
No. 11/1966. In a working meeting with Parliamentary Commission 
II [Roman numeral two] on Wednesday, 8 June, Minister/State 
Secretary Murdiono reiterated that the new law on foreign 
investment is not meant to affect Press Law No. 11. 
  It is a fact that Press Law No. 11 1966 was issued much 
earlier than the Law on Foreign Investment No. 1/1967. Article 
13, Sub-Article (2) of the press law reiterates that capital for 
press companies should be fully state-owned. On the other hand, 
Article 6 of the Law on Foreign Investment opens the mass media 
sector to foreign investors on the condition that they do not 
become wholly- owned foreign enterprises. 
  The question that arises now is why did policymakers not 
fairly consider and look into details of the press law when they 
formulated the Law on Foreign Investment No. 1/1967? However, 
there are people who feel that there is no need to create a 
controversy over the law on foreign investment and the press law 
because the two laws regulate two different points. Law No. 
11/1966 deals with press regulation, while Law No. 1/1967 
regulates the mass media industry. It is common knowledge that 
the mass media cover much wider areas than the press. 
  The fact that the government is in the process of producing 
a 
draft bill on broadcasting lends support to the above statement. 
This means that the electronic media is regulated by an 
exclusive law and the print media is regulated by the press law. 
  When electronic media and print media are regulated by their 
respective laws, there is a tendency for journalists working for 
electronic media to be affiliated with journalists from the 
print media under the Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI). 
  We should take lessons from our past experience in 
connection 
with the issue of allowing foreign capital to enter the media 
industry. This is because in the 1960's, when the industry was 
widely opened to foreign capital, the foreign investors insisted 
on a revision of the Code of Laws on Trade pertaining to the 
right to votes for companies' shares. As we all know, Article 
54 of the Code of Laws on Limited Companies imposes a limit on 
the freedom of votes. Even if a person owns 100 percent of the 
shares in a company, his right to vote is limited to six shares 
only. 
  The foreign investors tried to make a breakthrough on this 
rule -- they wanted unlimited freedom of votes. The foreign 
investors' wish was achieved via Law No. 14/1971 that does not 
impose a limit on votes. In other words, the law fixes a 
one-share-one-vote system. With the issuance of Law No. 
14/1971, existing limited companies have the options either to 
observe the limited votes according to the Code of Laws on Trade 
or to opt for the one-share-one-vote system under Law No. 
14/1971. 
  The foreign investors have a strong influence and we are 
worried about the mass media industry opening up to them, even 
if they do not wholly-own the enterprises. If the foreign 
investors come from countries that adopt a liberal democracy, 
there is a strong possibility that they will want the media 
industry that they have invested in to adopt a liberal press. 
  As we all know, our national press does not adopt the 
antagonistic competition attitude the way a liberal press policy 
does. On the other hand, our national press adopts the 
symbolism of the mutually supportive and not the mutually 
terminative. In this connection, the openness implemented by 
some countries that adopt a liberal press is certainly not 
interpreted in the same manner by the Indonesian press. Our 
national press believes in expanding the positive interaction 
between the government and the people. 
  Based on this understanding, it has always been stressed 
that 
the atmosphere of openness that has been developed over the last 
several years should not be abused. Such abuse can be found in 
the form of trying to develop a style of news reporting that 
gives priority to freedom rather than responsibility. 
  One of the characteristics of a liberal press is to spread 
antagonism, which usually leads to conflicts and competition 
between one agency and another and sets one official against 
another. 
  Lately, several observers and some board members of the PWI 
have anticipated that there is a lack of understanding about the 
openness policy by some newspaper journalists. This can be seen 
from the way their news reports are written. Among other 
things, it has been stressed that the atmosphere of openness 
that has been developed should not be polluted by a reporting 
style that projects a negative thinking [preceding two words in 
English] and totally ignores the principles of positive thinking 
[preceding two words in English]. It is within this context that 
we would like to underline President Suharto's warning in 
Lampung on Thursday, 9 June that the mass media is facing 
competition. He said action should be taken against such a 
style of news reporting because it will become a threat to 
national stability and finally disrupt the development process 
if it is allowed to continue.

  [Text] Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the 
current fluctuation of major currencies should be temporary and 
that the situation would stabilize soon. In an interview with 
reporters at Government House this morning, the finance minister 
said the current appreciation of the baht is both good and bad 
for Thai exports. 
  [Begin recording] [Tharin] This is an ordinary realignment 
of international markets. The situation is being monitored by 
the Exchange Equalization Fund. There is a little fluctuation 
at foreign exchange markets, but we believe the situation would 
stabilize soon. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the stronger baht have an 
impact on our exports? 
  [Tharin] There is no big change at present. What has 
happened is an ordinary adjustment to global changes. 
  [Reporter] The dollar is said to have slipped very low, and 
there has been a call for the government not to peg the baht to 
the dollar. What is going to be done on this matter? 
  [Tharin] Our exchange system has the baht tied to a basket 
of currencies. Under this system, we tie the baht to foreign 
currencies and we use this as a medium of trade. This is the 
reason why the value of the baht has to be adjusted in 
accordance with realities. However, we rely heavily on 
U.S.dollars. Since the dollar has weakened slightly, the baht 
has become stronger compared to the dollar. But, compared to 
the yen and mark, the value of the baht has dropped slightly. 
Therefore, the current situation favors our exports to Japan 
and Europe. [End recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Take Care of Baht Value"] </F>
  [Text] As the whole world is mesmerized by the ongoing 
world soccer tournament, a monetary crisis has suddenly broken 
out. The world's major currency, the U.S. dollar, has plunged 
in value while Japanese yen has skyrocketted. On Wednesday, one 
dollar fetched only 99.85 yen, the lowest since the end of the 
World War II. The people in Japan and the United States are 
aghast. 
  This monetary incident is bad for both the United States and 
Japan. The U.S. Federal Reserve had to intervene in the New 
York financial market by buying more U.S. dollars to save the 
exchange rate from dropping. The Bank of Japan also made 
similar efforts. As for Japan, the stronger yen will obviously 
precipitate the problems because Japanese goods will be more 
expensive and will not be able to compete in any market. 
  The United Stated had to intervene in the financial market 
for fear of a further aggravation of its trade balance. Stock 
markets fell worldwide because it is anticipated that the United 
States will increase interest rates to prevent the further 
decline of the dollar and to arrest inflation. To a certain 
extent Thailand is also affected by a weaker dollar. One dollar 
which bought 25.16 baht is now only worth only 25.05 baht. On 
Wednesday, the Bank of Thailand had to work out certain measures 
to prevent the baht from appreciating. 
  Semifinished products and raw materials imported from Japan, 
Germany, and several other countries will become more expensive 
now. As a result of the new exchange rate, the price of Thai 
products will rise because we have to add in the risk-cost of 
the new rate. Although we use U.S. dollars as our medium of 
trade, we will have some difficulties in selling our products in 
foreign markets. 
  We appeal to the Bank of Thailand and the Thai Banking 
Association to urgently work out measures to prevent the baht 
from appreciating. We must not think that we can relax just 
because our baht is tied to a basket of currencies. The 
probability of the appreciation of the baht currency is always 
there despite its link with other currencies. 
  Several countries have now recognized our baht currency, 
while many people have called for the relaxation of restrictions 
on the release of baht loans in foreign countries. We must be 
extremely cautious and try to stabilize the value of our baht 
currency.

  [Text] An ASEAN meeting next month will discuss North 
Korea's refusal to let international inspectors into its nuclear 
plants, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said yesterday. 
  Speaking to reporters upon arriving at Don Muang Airport 
from 
a visit to South Korea, Chuan said leaders of the ASEAN 
(Association of Southeast Nations) countries will convene a 
meeting next month and will discuss the issue. 
  Chuan he said the tension would ease now that South and 
North 
Koreas had agreed in principle to conduct a meeting over the 
issue. 
  The United States has accused North Korea of using its 
nuclear programme to produce weapons, a charge Pyongyang has 
denied. 
  A growing international crisis over the nuclear programme 
eased after North Korea promised to halt the programme in return 
for a resumption of high-level talks with the United States. 
  On Friday, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said a 
meeting between President Clinton and North Korean leader Kim 
ll-song was possible if North Korea's behaviour merits it.

<F P=106> [Wina Chanrung and Marisa Chimprapha] </F>
  [Text] The National Security Council (NSC) has again warned 
Burmese students if they attempt to protest against Burma's 
participation in the Asean meeting next month they will face 
apprehension and tough legal action. 
  NSC deputy chief Khachatphai Burutphat said the government 
has allowed the Burmese students to stay here on the condition 
that they do not use Thailand as a base for staging political 
moves against the Burmese government. 
  "We will regard them as illegal immigrants and arrest them 
if 
they stage a protest against the presence of Burma at the Asean 
conference in July," he said. 
  Khachatphai was responding to a report that Burmese students 
living along the border and at Maniloi holding centre in 
Ratchaburi province planned to organize a rally in front of the 
Bangkok hotel where the Asean meeting takes place on July 23-28. 
  A high-ranking official in the Interior Ministry recently 
confirmed the ministry had been informed of the planned protest 
by Burmese at the holding centre who disagreed with the move. 
  The official, who asked not to be named, said Burmese along 
the border had telephoned their friends at Maniloi and urged 
them to join the rally. 
  "However there is a group of the students who disagree and 
they told the centre's chief about it," he said. The government 
opened the camp for the Burmese last year, but only about 200 of 
the 516 granted student-in-exile status have entered the camp. 
  The official said the ministry had information that some 
Burmese students planned to sneak from the camp to join the 
protest in Bangkok. Students living in the camp can take leave 
for a few days with consent of the camp head. 
  Rangoon's Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, will represent Burma 
at the meeting as guest of Thailand, the host country this year. 
The invitation has drawn strong criticism from several groups as 
Burma is still governed by the military. 
  The junta, officially the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, has detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi since 
1989 and refused to hand over administrative power to the 
political party which won the 1990 elections. 
  "Thailand has already been accused of supporting Burma's 
anti-government movement by allowing the Burmese students stay 
here. However, we will not stand by idly if they use the country 
as a base for launching political activities," said Khachatphai. 
  The Maniloi camp chief would be instructed to restrict 
movement out of the camp before and during the Asean conference. 
  Tight security would also be provided for the ministers 
attending the Asean forum, including the Burmese minister, he 
added. 
  Deputy Permanent Secretary to Interior Chaloem Phromloet has 
also warned the Burmese they would be arrested and their student 
status revoked if they joined the protest. 
  They would then be charged as illegal immigrants, 
interrogated and given the choice of being deported back to 
Burma or entering the Maniloi holding centre. 
  "I don't really understand why the Burmese students would 
stage a protest as the Burmese minister, as guest of the host, 
will not participate in the full meeting. He will only attend 
certain functions," said Chaloem.

  [Text] Special Branch Police have freed a Pakistani 
national, earlier suspected of involvement in a plot to harm the 
Nepalese crown prince. 
  Pakistani Embassy First Secretary Mushtaq Haider Rizvi said 
last night that Shakil Ahmad was freed without any charges 
lodged against him. 
  The man was handed over to the embassy on Friday by the 
Special Branch which said he was not involved in any plot and 
had done nothing wrong. 
  Mr Rizvi said Ammad was expected to fly home today. 
  Ahmad was apprehended at the Asian Institute of Technology 
[AIT] on Sunday evening after he and his friend, Mohammad Javed, 
tried to enter the campus. 
  Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop quoted Ahmad as telling 
investigators he wanted to enter the AIT to use its telephone to 
make overseas call. 
  Javed fled in a pickup truck after AIT security guards asked 
to see the pair's passport. 
  Khlong Luang Police, who apprehended Ahmad, immediately 
handed him to the Special Branch for questioning on suspicion 
that he and Javed might have been trying to harm Nepalese Crown 
Prince Dhirendra Bir Bikram Shah who was taking a short 
geography course at the institute at the time. 
  The Nepalese and Pakistani embassies have denied there was 
any plot by Ahmad to harm Crown Prince Shah, who is on an 
official visit to Thailand after completing his studies at AIT.

  [Text] With hostilities between the Cambodian government 
and Khmer Rouge guerrillas intensifying, Thailand is to open a 
border check-point to allow temporary refuge to affected 
Cambodians, according to a spokesman of the Burapha Force. 
  Col Prayun Thamwongsa said neither side was sincere in 
wanting to solve the conflict and the June 16 negotiations 
failed because of their hardline positions. 
  Battles between the two factions have become more intense 
since the talks broke down, according to Prayun. 
  The battles in Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey province, near 
the 
Thai-Cambodian border, saw some bombs falling on Thai soil in 
Tambon Khlong Luk, Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo Province. 
Residents of both Bantaey Meanchey and Sa Kaeo province have 
been seriously affected by the battles. 
  Recently, the Banteay Meanchey governor, the commissioner of 
the Burapha Force, and a senior Cambodian militarist had met to 
discuss the plight of border residents affected by the fighting. 
  They agreed to allow Cambodians to temporarily enter Thai 
soil at Tambon Khlong Luk from July 1, according to Prayun. 
  However, the re-opening of the Klong Luk check-point for 
Cambodians was changed to June 30 because the Sa Kaeo governor 
would not be available to attend the check-point reopening 
ceremony on July 1. 
  The re-opening ceremony will be held at the middle of the 
friendship bridge in Tambon Klong Luk. 
  Prayun said officials of the two countries also agreed that 
each party would control its men from committing any offence on 
the other country's soil. Any party violating the accord would 
have to pay compensation. 
  In the meantime, Col Woranan Namwong, a representative of 
the 
Suranari Force, warned Thai people along the Thai-Cambodian 
border not to cross into Cambodian territory as they could 
become casualties of the fighting.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry plans to lower the external 
debt service to eight percent of the annual government 
expenditure budget through a debt prepayment of US$210 million. 
  Last week, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen to less than 
100 yen to US$1, giving the ministry a good opportunity to 
prepay foreign debt. A source said at the end of this month, 
the ministry will make a prepayment on loans extended to 
national development projects many years ago. This payment 
amounts to US$210 million, which carries an interest rate of 
8.25 per cent. There are two portions: about US$100 million in 
Japanese currency, US$50 million in US dollars and the rest in 
other currencies. 
  The prepayment will spare Thailand from paying interest over 
the next 7-8 years. The ministry will use the fiscal reserve of 
about Bt[baht]200 million to make the prepayment. 
  The Finance Ministry has also sent a letter to the Asian 
Development Bank requesting permission to make a prepayment. 
Thailand currently owes ADB about US$200 million. 
  The source said that external debt service currently amounts 
to more than 8 percent of the national expenditure budget.

  [Text] Bangkok -- The Money Laundering Law Drafting 
Committee revealed the increase in money laundering through the 
stock market. Money launderers are reported to have purchased 
stocks to take over businesses. Such a practice is prevalent in 
foreign countries and is now spreading in the Thai stock market. 
Preventive measures are being worked out to authorize the 
information management committee to examine financial records of 
possible launderers and keep track of stock transactions. 
  Wiraphong Bunyophat, director of the Economic Crime 
Information Center and a member of the Money Laundering Law 
Drafting Committee, disclosed that a seminar on financial 
institutes' perception of money laundering law will be held at 
the Faculty of Law of Chulalongkon University on 29 June. 
  The seminar will hear views and comments on the legislation 
from various financial institutes such as the Securities 
Exchange of Thailand, Office of Securities Exchange Commission, 
commercial banks, and central bank. 
  At the initial stage, the money laundering law will focus 
only on the money earned from narcotic trafficking to ensure its 
quick passage. It will take time if the law will be designed to 
deal with incomes from other illicit activities. In most cases, 
money launderers will deposit their money in different banks 
under the names of different persons which makes it difficult 
for official examination. 
  The committee, therefore, proposed the change in the 
regulations governing opening of bank accounts so that 
depositors are required to show their citizen identification 
cards and evidence to prove that the money is theirs. 
Meanwhile, most commercial banks are very cooperative with 
authorities in checking deposit accounts. However, a specific 
law is needed to facilitate the operation. 
  It is rather difficult to launder dirty money through the 
national bank because the latter has an effective examination 
system. 
  The stock market is the second place after commercial banks 
for money laundering. More launderers are believed to turn to 
the stock market to launder their money. As more companies 
become public companies, money launderers can buy as much stock 
as they want. In some cases, they even take over businesses. 
  Wiraphong noted: "Such a practice is prevalent in foreign 
countries, where dirty money is used to buy public companies in 
the stock market. This is now taking place on the Thai stock 
market, so preventive measures must be worked out." 
  Commenting on the preventive measures, Wiraphong said that 
the procedure now being used by commercial banks might be 
applicable. For instance, stock buyers and sellers are required 
to open accounts, and the committee is authorized to check their 
financial status at various financial institutes. No one is 
allowed to open an account on behalf of others. 
  In this regard, Pricha Suwannathat is working on the clause 
on the prevention of money laundering through financial 
institutes. 
  So far, the money laundering through stock buying and 
selling 
is being widely practiced in the northern part of Thailand. 
Money earned from narcotics trafficking is used to buy stocks 
at trading floors in the northern provinces. There is no law 
permitting the authorities to examine the source of the money.

  [Text] The Journalists Association of Thailand last month 
organized a seminar entitled: "Thailand and a Money Laundering 
Law." Speaking at the seminar were Police General Chawalit 
Yotmani, secretary general of the Office of the Narcotics 
Control Board; Pricha Suwannathat, MP from Bangkok; Chatchai 
Sutthikrom, director of the Assets Examination Division of the 
Anticorruption Committee; and Dr. Bandit Nitthawon, deputy 
director of the Technical Department of the Bank of Thailand. 
  The seminar, designed to find legal measures to facilitate 
suppression of international narcotics trafficking syndicates, 
was motivated by the legal charge by the U.S. Government against 
Thanong Siriprichaphong, a former MP of the Chat Thai Party from 
Nakhon Phanom Province, for his alleged involvement in 
international drug trafficking. However, Thailand has no law or 
any evidence to prosecute the accused. 
  Without a law against money laundering, narcotics prevention 
and suppression works in Thailand are fruitless. Authorities 
are unable to trace sources of dirty money or money earned 
through illicit means. Dirty money, especially drug money, is 
purified and legalized after it has passed through the hands of 
financial institutions. Authorities can never confiscate it or 
take legal action against its owner. 
  Money laundering is defined as an act of purifying through 
financial institutions money that is earned from illegal 
activities. The money is used to invest in stock markets or 
other businesses to prove that it is legally earned. After the 
laundering process, authorities cannot confiscate it or use it 
as evidence against its owner. 
  An attempt was once made in Thailand to pass a money 
laundering law in accordance with the Vienna Convention. The 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board, Police Department, Office 
of the Juridical Council, Office of the Supreme Attorney 
General, international organizations, and the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency worked together to draft the legislation. 
However, the Bank of Thailand and several domestic financial 
institutions voiced their disagreement by saying that 
enforcement of an anti-money laundering law would constitute a 
violation of individual privacy and was against the secrecy law 
which prohibits commercial banks from releasing personal 
information about their clients. 
  But now the Bank of Thailand fully supports the passage of a 
money laundering law. Bandit Nitthawon, deputy director of the 
Technical Department, said that since Thailand is a financial 
hub, so it must adjust itself to meet world standards and 
enforce a money laundering prevention law. The law will also 
serve as a deterrence against all types of economic and 
political crimes and corruption. 
  An anti-money laundering law is, therefore, a measure to 
prosecute law violators. The law will enable authorities to 
trace the origins of dirty money and gather evidence to 
prosecute its owner. 
  Without a money laundering law, authorities will encounter 
enormous difficulties in filing criminal cases because they do 
not have evidence, nor can they use the illegally-earned money 
as evidence. 
  The anti-money laundering law to be promulgated by the 
government must cover money from not only drug trafficking, but 
also other unscrupulous activities such as stock manipulation, 
weapons and contraband trade, and corruption. 
  Moreover, financial institutions must be obliged by the law 
to keep authorities informed about accounts of their clients 
when amounts of money reach a fixed level. They are also 
required to keep records of the real and family names of 
depositors and notify agencies concerned about any suspicious 
transactions of money made by their clients so that authorities 
can take appropriate follow-up action. 
  Promulgation of an anti-money laundering law is certainly 
not 
detrimental to investment or the free monetary policy of the 
government. On the contrary, it will assist efforts to turn our 
country into the financial hub of the region. It is beneficial 
in the long run because it can be used as a tool to trace the 
origins of illegally-earned money. Therefore, the government 
must expedite passage of this law in order to suppress 
wrongdoers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thailand and Growth: Luck Will Run Out Soon"] </F>
  [Text] East Asian economic growth has attracted a great 
deal of interest recently. Two top researchers at the Thailand 
Development Research Institute (TDRI) have concluded that 
Thailand is on a muddled path towards economic prosperity. 
  "Unlike other newly-industrialized countries in Asia, where 
governments helped repair market failures, Thailand has relied 
on the market to overcome government failures. This formula 
will no longer suffice, given technological, environmental and 
human resource challenges at hand," concluded TDRI's Scott 
Christensen and Amma Sayamwala. 
  The state is indeed struggling to keep up with the demands 
of 
a rapidly changing economy. The problems are too well apparent 
as the two researchers noted: "Even though Thailand has enjoyed 
some success, it is not well prepared for the next stage of 
industrialization. Its investments in secondary education and 
its output of technicians and engineers fall seriously short of 
the country's needs. Moreover, the state is institutionally 
ill-equipped to assume the monitoring, enforcement, and social 
welfare functions for regulating an advanced industrial economy." 
  So what should we do? 
<H5>  State intervention? </H5>
  The two researchers stopped short of advocating increased 
state intervention in the economy but called for more effective 
government action in those sectoral policy areas where the 
private sector will increasingly rely upon the government to act. 
  These policy areas include education, worker training, 
public 
health social welfare, monitoring and enforcing environmental 
and safety regulations and supporting and perhaps coordinating 
scientific research. 
  All these, they argue, do not need more active state 
intervention but rather more vision to make intelligent 
decisions, acquire a better information base and initiate better 
coordination between the private and public sectors. 
  In a parallel tone, Dr Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam 
Commercial Bank and former top economist at the Bank of Thailand 
suggested that the government should make it a policy to create 
"national awareness" about technology upgrading, and build up 
skilled labour, in order for the country to compete more 
effectively in international markets. 
  The era of cheap labour is gone, Olan said. "National 
awareness should be made concrete... There may be tax incentives 
for the private sector to undertake manpower and on-the-job 
trainings," Olan said. 
  While consensus has emerged on the target areas, the speed 
to 
which the government is responding is slow and varies between 
ministries and agencies. Some are doing better than others but 
an overall policy strategy and direction is still lacking on the 
part of the government. 
  Also, profound economic changes are taking place within the 
Asean region where there is now a high standard of living and a 
rapid process of industrialization. However, uneven development 
between and within nations persists and presents numerous 
contradictory economic problems that ultimately explain the 
extent of labour migration that is occurring within the region. 
  Thailand is both an exporter and importer of labour, but yet 
migration push and pull forces have yet to be fully addressed by 
the government. As the world enters the 21st century, it is 
inevitable that international labour migration flows will 
intensify within Asean itself. 
<H5>  Brain-drain phenomenon </H5>
  While the government complains about the rapid brain-drain 
phenomenon in the country, especially among new engineering 
graduates, nothing is made to prevent them from leaving Thailand 
to take up lucrative offers from multi-national companies. 
  It is easy to urge Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to exert his 
leadership in order to create a more effective state. However, 
his performance in the past two years leaves much to be desired. 
Moreover he lacks a vision for Thailand in the 21st century 
unlike many of his counterparts in Asean. Perhaps, more 
pressure should be exerted on certain forward-looking ministers 
to take up this challenge. 
  Without doubt, Thailand must put its house in order first 
before it begins to pull its weight in the 21st century. If it 
fails to do so, sad to say within a few years it might not be 
able to keep pace with its vigorous neighbors.

<F P=106> ["Japan and S. Korean Authorities Must Not Interfere in </F>
Third- Round DPRK-U.S. Talks, DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman" 
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
today answered a question put by KCNA about the outcries of 
Japan and the South Korean authorities that the question of the 
"special inspection" of DPRK's military sites must be resolved 
at the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  He said: 
  As has been reported, the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks will 
be 
held in Geneva in the first week of July. 
  It is expected that the outstanding questions between the 
DPRK and the United States including the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula and the relations between the two countries 
will be solved in this round of talks in a package deal. 
  Japan and the South Korean authorities, however, are trying 
to force a "special inspection" on military sites of the DPRK, 
claiming that the "nuclear suspicion" against it must be 
clarified at the talks and it must "accept a full inspection." 
  A sinister aim is lurking behind this fuss impudently raised 
by Japan and the South Korean authorities that are not parties 
to the talks. 
  Japan and the South Korean authorities, that did not want a 
progress at the DPRK-USA talks and a fair solution to the 
"nuclear issue" from the beginning, are now hurriedly running 
about to put a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-USA talks, unable 
to conceal their perplexity and irritation, as it has become 
certain that the talks will be resumed. 
  Judging from this, it is clear that the ulterior intention 
of 
Japan and the South Korean authorities in trying to impose 
inspection of military sites on the DPRK under the pretext of 
its "nuclear suspicion" is to lay hurdles in the way of the 
hard-won third round of DPRK-USA talks and the settlement of the 
"nuclear issue" and find an excuse for promoting and justifying 
their own nuclear armament. 
  Japan and the South Korean authorities are alleging that the 
DPRK is keeping something in concealment. But we have no 
nuclear weapon and feel no need to manufacture them. 
  As for the "suspected nuclear program" of the DPRK over 
which 
some forces are making much ado, it is a problem that will 
naturally be resolved when DPRK-USA talks proceed successfully 
and confidence is built between the DPRK and the USA. 
  Therefore, there is no need for Japan and the South Korean 
authorities to trouble themselves about this. 
  If some forces, urged by a sinister intention, try to impose 
inspection of military sites, which means an infringement on the 
sovereignty of the DPRK, it will not be beneficial to them, 
either, and will produce grave consequences.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Provokers' Confession, Witnesses' </F>
Testimony"] 
  [Text] The date of 25 June 44 years ago was the date when 
the United States provoked a war of aggression in Korea. The 
fact that the United States planned, prepared for, and provoked 
a criminal war of aggression in Korea has been confessed by the 
provokers themselves. This is a historic fact to which 
witnesses and the world have testified. 
  First of all, the United States mapped out a detailed plan 
and made scrupulous preparations for the war of aggression in 
Korea. As far as the United States was concerned, its invasion 
of the northern half of the Republic was a central question in 
U.S. policy toward South Korea at that time. In this 
connection, the United States had made preparations for an armed 
invasion of the northern half of the Republic right since the 
end of World War II. 
  At that time, then U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Muccio 
stated definitely: A northward invasion is a central question 
in the U.S. policy toward South Korea. Therefore, this question 
should not be slighted. 
  Already in May 1950, the eve of the war provoked, (Jones), 
director of the South Korean Affairs Department of the former 
U.S. Agency for Economic Aid, said: They are armed with 
American-style weapons. One hundred-thousand-strong South 
Korean troops, who have been trained by U.S. Army officers under 
the supervision of a U.S. Armed Forces' mission in Seoul, have 
completed all of their preparations. They are ready to start a 
war at any time. 
  At that time, (Seybold), director of the (?Foreign Affairs 
Bureau) of the MacArthur Command, pointed out: As far as a 
conquest of North Korea is concerned, the battleships or 
aircraft in Japan will participate in battles on the side of 
South Korea. Therefore, there will be nothing to be worried 
about as far as the Navy and Air Force are concerned. 
  LIFE, a U.S. magazine, wrote: We have never seen an 
example--in which much preparations have been made--in any kind 
of war waged up until now, throughout the entire period of our 
history, other than when the Korean War started. 
  (CONBADIE) of France wrote in the 29 July, 1953 edition: 
Judging from all facts today, the United States had already made 
preparations for the Korean War right since the end of World War 
II. 
  An American publication entitled "Who Ignited the Korean 
War?" pointed out that such meticulous preparations had been 
completed in May 1950. 
  The warmongers, who had finished their preparations for the 
war, watched only for an opportunity to ignite a war. 
  On the foremost front along the 38th Parallel on 18 June, 
1950, Dulles, a former U.S. presidential special envoy who had 
sneaked into South Korea for a final check-up for preparations 
for a Korean war, mapped out a scenario--for the puppets--aimed 
at covering up their provocation of a war, saying: Along with 
counter-propaganda that North Korea invaded first, you should 
launch an attack on North Korea. If you hold out for two weeks, 
the United States will bring a charge that North Korea has 
invaded South Korea during that period so that the United 
Nations will have to mobilize ground, naval, and air forces in 
its name. We will see to it that everything goes on smoothly. 
  On 20 June two days later, he clamored: The purpose of my 
visit to South Korea as a special envoy of President Truman is 
to study the situation about the preparations for a war--which 
we have actively pushed for--and to present my opinion that you 
had better not hesitate in launching a northward invasion if 
there is nothing insufficient. In my opinion, everything has 
been prepared satisfactorily. As long as preparations have been 
made, the sooner, the better. 
  Dulles then gave an order that a northward invasion be 
launched on 25 June. 
  In June 1950, at that time, Robert, director of the U.S. 
military advisory group, spat out the inside truth by saying: 
Why did we choose the date of 25 June? Herein lies our 
prudent intention. June 25th is a Sunday. The United States, a 
Christian country, and South Korea regard Sunday as a Sabbath 
Day. No one will believe that we launched a war on a Sunday. 
In other words, this is aimed at making people believe that we 
have not ignited a war first. 
  It is a stereotyped trick of the United States to wickedly 
maneuver to shift its responsibility for a provocation onto 
another's shoulders. 
  In his book entitled "A Secret History of the Korean War," 
an 
American reporter exposed: The United States Government has 
already prepared a draft of a resolution to be used at the 
United Nations. Without undergoing (?negotiations) and 
investigation at the UN Security Council, it demanded that the 
United Nations brand North Korea an aggressor. 
  An American critic disclosed: The news about 25 June, 1950 
that North Korea attacked South Korea has been come out of the 
pockets of Syngman Rhee and MacArthur. 
  The true nature of the war provokers was made clear also in 
a 
report filed by the UN Commission on Korea to the UN Secretary 
General on 24 June, one day before the provocation of the war. 
  The report pointed out: Up to now, our commission has not 
received any information from any intelligence organization that 
the North Korean armed forces have an attempt for an aggression. 
On the contrary, the North Korean regime is now absorbed in 
implementing the two-year people's economy. 
  (Herringer), a former professor of the University of 
Pennsylvania, pointed out: The one that was dealt an unexpected 
blow was not the United States, but the communist camp. 
  An American scholar (Meier) exposed the truth by noting: The 
People's Army launched a counterattack after withdrawing two to 
three kilometers on all fronts of the 38th Parallel after having 
been dealt an unexpected attack from the South Korean Army. 
  Like this, the United States believed that its scenario for 
provoking the Korean War would remain a secret forever. But, it 
has been fully revealed to the world by Americans' own 
confessions, documents, and the world's media. 
  The truth about the U.S. imperialists' provocation of the 
Korean War can never be covered up.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Scores of warplanes of 
the U.S. Seventh Airforce and Marines staged a joint air war 
exercise against the DPRK in the skies above Taejon, Chonju and 
Kunsan, South Korea, on June 22, military sources said. 
  An overseas-based E-3 was involved in the exercise. 
  In the June 21-23 period scores of large transport planes 
airlifted large quantities of uptodate lethal weapons and 
military equipment to U.S. Airforce bases in South Korea from 
the U.S. mainland and Pacific bases. 
  This fully shows that although the U.S. imperialists pay lip 
service to peace and detente on the Korean peninsula, they have 
not given up the ambition for invading the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The American Friends 
Service Committee in a statement June 14 called for a peaceful 
solution to the Korean question. It said the U.S. authorities 
must give the top priority to the welfare and interests of the 
70 million Korean people with regard to the problem of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Urging the United States to declare no more that it regards 
military action as a policy option on the Korean peninsula, the 
statement said it must admit that dialogue and negotiation are 
the most reasonable and just means of ironing out its 
differences with the DPRK. 
  It said attention must be drawn to the danger of the nuclear 
weapons possessed by nuclear states including the United States 
and steps be taken for a total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
  All parties concerned must, above all, prevent the 
recurrence 
of the destructive war in Korea, it said. 
  It warned that international "sanctions" will only increase 
the tension. We consider a permanent solution to the question 
is dialogue, not the means of arms, it said.

<F P=106> ["War Clamour Against Dialogue"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Kim Chong-pil, chairman 
of the South Korean "Democratic Liberal Party", recently showed 
up at an army unit on the forefront along the Military 
Demarcation Line and blared that if a war broke out he "would 
fight on the front even as a private second class." And the 
words "preparedness" and "resolution" came from "a meeting of 
main commanders" of the puppet army. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as an 
agitation of war against dialogue. 
  The analyst says: 
  Now the fellow countrymen in the North and the South and the 
whole world are hailing the opening of the road of a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through 
dialogue. At this moment, Kim Chong-pil and other war-thirsty 
elements of South Korea drove to the forefront along the 
Military Demarcation Line and incited confrontation and war. 
This is an intolerable challenge to the entire compatriots and 
the world peaceloving people. 
  Kim Chong-pil is the man who bartered away the interests of 
the nation to the aggressors who had forced colonial slavery 
upon the Korean people by playing the leading role in the 
conclusion of the South Korea-Japan "agreement." 
  If the traitor Kim Chong-pil is a Korean, how could he sell 
off the interests of the nation to outside forces and can seek 
today a fratricidal war which would lead to national destruction. 
  Such bellicose elements as Kim Chong-pil must be removed, if 
the war danger is to be averted on the Korean peninsula and the 
reunification question be solved peacefully. 
  Should the South Korean war-likers persistently follow the 
road of war, creating new obstacles to the dialogue, they will 
only meet their destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- The National Council of 
Representatives of Trade Unions (Chonnodae) of South Korea 
called a press conference on June 24 as regards the authorities' 
suppression of the National Council of Locomotive Workers 
(Chongihyop) and made public a four-point demand including the 
resignation of the "home minister", withdrawal of the prior 
issue of a warrant for the arrest of the chairman of the Seoul 
subway workers union and resumption of sincere negotiation with 
Chongihyop, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  It declared that if its demand is not met, more than 30 
trade 
unions under Chonnodae including the Hyundai Heavy Industries 
would enter a general strike from June 27 and arouse other 
trade unions to it for a nationwide joint strike. 
  On the same day, some 500 students joined 1,800 unionists of 
the Seoul subway in their sit-down strike at Kyunghui University 
and over 200 locomotive engineers under Chongihyop staged an 
all-night sit-in struggle in demand of an open apology from the 
"government" for infiltrating government power into the 
Christian Hall in Seoul. 
  Meanwhile, the Pusan subway workers union entered a total 
strike at break of June 25 and as many as 360 academic and other 
public figures and workers in North Cholla Province published an

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The joint measure 
committee for the improvement of railway and subway working 
conditions held a rally of workers and citizens for denouncing 
the suppression of the National Council of Subway Workers Unions 
(Chonjihyop) in Seoul on June 25 with the attendance of more 
than 1,000 workers, dissident figures and students, according to 
a radio report from Seoul. 
  The participants in a resolution held that the invocation of 
"government" power by the authorities was a clear violation of 
the "actual law" and demanded six points including the 
resignation of the "home minister" who had illegally set police 
in-motion, the release of the detained workers, scrapping of the 
want list and the revision of the evil labour law. 
  A co-representative of the National Council of Trade Union 
Representatives (Chonnodae), Kwon Yong-kil, declared at the 
rally that in case the authorities failed to accept the demand 
of the workers, they would answer with an allout struggle 
including a solidarity strike on June 27. 
  After the rally, the participants took part in the function 
of "June 25 grand torch procession for national reconciliation 
and peace" sponsored by the preparatory committee for the 
formation of the South side headquarters of the National 
Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon), and 
marched to subway stations in the city and distributed copies of 
a literature to citizens. 
  In a separate action, the National Locomotive Council 
(Chongihyop) which entered the second day of a sit-in in Seoul 
held a press conference on June 24 and declared that the engine 
drivers affiliated with it would never go back to work, if their 
demand for the release of the detainees, apology for the 
invocation of "government" power and the withdrawal of police 
force was not met.

<F P=106> ["Japan Directly Involved in War of Aggression on Korea -- </F>
Memorandum of DPRK Institute for International Affairs" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Institute for 
International Affairs on June 23 published a memorandum opening 
to the world public concrete data proving that Japan 
participated in the June 25 1950-July 27 1953 war of aggression 
on Korea. The memorandum was released when the revived Japanese 
militarists have been creating a grave danger to peace and 
security not only on the Korean peninsula but also in the rest 
of Asia, not bothering to conceal their intention to commit 
another military aggression against the Korean people. The 
memorandum consists of four parts, "1. Japan prepared with the 
United States for a war of aggression on Korea", "2. Japan 
served U.S. Forces as a logistic base, supply base, repair base 
and attack base during the Korean war", "3. Japan was directly 
involved in the Korean war" and "4. Japan directly participated 
in the germ warfare, too". 
  According to the memorandum, 850 munitions factories had 
been 
returned to Japanese monopoly capitalists by the U.S. 
occupation forces in Japan by 1949, and 645 Japanese arms 
factories had resumed production toward the end of 1949. 
(Japanese book "Postwar History of Japan" Part I, 1970 edition, 
p. 60). 
  In 1949, the year before the outbreak of the war in Korea, 
Japanese arms factories supplied the South Korean puppet army 
with 40,000 rifles, more than 2,000 bazookas and 40,000 shells, 
a large number of 105 mm howitzers and 37 mm and 57 mm anti-tank 
guns, flame throwers, 60-80 mm mortar guns and 700,000 shells, 
mines and over 2,000 machine guns and submachine guns and 
upwards of 4,900 trucks. (Japanese book "Reunification of Korea 
and Human Rights", 1976 edition, p. 116). 
  The United States reorganized and rearmed the Japanese Army 
under the name of "police". In March 1948 the United States 
enforced a new police system in Japan and increased the police 
force to 125,000 men and armed them with weapons and equipment 
of U.S. Army's type. 
  In a letter to the then Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida July 
8, 1950, Macarthur, the then commander of the U.S. Forces in 
the Far East, instructed him to found a new "police reserve 
force" 75,000 strong and reinforce the existing military 
strength of the maritime safety agency by 8,000 men. 
Subsequently, the Japanese Government enacted Decree no. 260 
and organized the "police reserve force" with soldiers of the 
old Japanese Army. (Japanese book "History of Japan", Vol. 22, 
"Contemporary History 1," 1977 edition). 
  While the Korean war was raging, Japan was virtually a 
warring party which played the role of both a quite actual 
logistic base and munitions factories. (South Korean magazine 
"MAL", June, 1990). 
  The United States purchased various kinds of munitions it 
needed from Japan. The specially ordered munitions for the 
Korean war in the period from May to the end of 1950 amounted to 
about 300 million dollars. (Japanese book "Japanese Imperialism 
and Military Industry", 1979 edition, p. 80). 
  Napalm bombs called a devilish weapon in the Korean war was 
mass produced by the Nissan Motors, (?Shii) Iron, Toyo Heat 
Industries, Fuji Industries-Handa, Showa Motors and other 
Japanese companies, and this accounted for 90 percent of the 
special orders for the U.S. Airforce in the Far East. (Japanese 
book "Modern History of Korea", 1953 edition, p. 266). 
  In the period from May 1952 to June 1953 Japanese factories 
produced and supplied to the U.S. Forces about 2,000 artillery 
pieces of different calibres, 7,656 bazooka- type anti-tank 
guns, 400,000 rocket shells, 1,200,000 shells, 2,300,000 mines 
of various kinds and 2,200,000 handgrenades. (Japanese magazine 
"ECONOMIST", June, 1952). 
  Japan earned a colossal amount of money and laid a 
groundwork for "a high-rate economic growth" by producing and 
supplying weapons and military equipment specially ordered for 
the U.S. Forces in the Korean war. (South Korean magazine "MAL", 
June, 1990, p. 164). 
  But for the Korean war, there would have been no high- rate 
growth of Japan. (Japanese book "Basic Vision of the Korean 
Question", 1976 edition, p. 178). 
  The U.S. imperialists installed and used 612 military bases 
and setups in Japan during their war of aggression on Korea. 
  U.S. warplanes made 700 to 800 sorties daily, 900 to 1,000 
sorties at times, from their Airforce bases in different parts 
of Japan including Okinawa and Aomori for promiscuous 
scorched-earth operations. (Book of the former Soviet Union 
"Korea Revives", 1956 edition). 
  The main force of the U.S. First Marines Division got aboard 
ships at Nagoya, Japan, and the Seventh Infantry Division at 
Yokohama and the Seventh Fleet rounded off preparations at 
Sasebo for a landing operation in Inchon, Korea. (Japanese book 
"Korean War" Vol. 4, 1969 edition) 
  Most of the ground, Naval and Air Forces of the United 
States 
conducted operations with Japan as their bases. (Japanese book 
"Postwar History of Japan" 1941 edition, p. 65) 
  The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters expressed their 
will 
to participate in the Korean war before the war broke out. 
  Hirokawa of the Liberal Party, a friend of then Japanese 
Prime Minister Yoshida, in July 1949 called for participating 
in a possible war on the side of the United States, saying that 
the "duty of the Japanese is to join their efforts with the 
United States." (Book of the former Soviet Union "U.S. 
Imperialism in Japan," 1951 edition, p. 100) 
  A reporter of TELEPRESS said in February 1951 that the 
United 
States recruited 140,000 Japanese for a war against the Korean 
people. (Book of the former Soviet Union "U.S. Imperialism in 
Japan," 1951 edition, p. 49) 
  Japan disguised the Japanese unit as "unit of Japan- 
resident 
Korean volunteers" to conceal its investment in the Korean war. 
(Japanese book "History of Modern Korea" 1953 edition, p. 266) 
  In September 1950, 30,000 Japanese were attached to U.S. 
technical and transport units to participate in the landing 
operation in Inchon and 10,000-strong Japanese "police reserve 
force" took part in military actions on the side of the 
aggressor. (Book of the former Soviet Union "U.S. Imperialism 
in Japan," 1951 edition, p. 49) 
  Mine sweeping was mostly done by the Japanese Navy before 
the 
landing operations of the U.S. Forces, and Japanese ships were 
mobilized in the transport of U.S. war supplies. 
  According to data announced by the ships bureau of the 
Japanese Ministry of Fisheries on October 14, 1950, Japan 
mobilized 248 ships for the Korean war from July to October 
1950, transporting 995,800 tons of U.S. war supplies. 
  And Japan mobilized transport ships from November to 
December 
1950 to ensure the retreat of the Tenth Army Corps of the U.S. 
imperialist aggression forces which was hit hard in the northern 
half of Korea. (South Korean magazine "MAL" June 1990) 
  Japan served as the base of the germ warfare of the U.S. 
imperialists in Korea. 
  The U.S. medical institute in Omiya, Saitama Prefecture, had 
taken over the bacteriological institute of the Japanese Army. 
The U.S. Forces manufactured bacteriological weapons there 
through researches. 
  The U.S. imperialists mobilized germ experts of the old 
Japanese Army, war criminals, in a germ warfare in Korea. 
("Report of the International Academic Committee on the 
Investigation Into the Germ Warfare in Korea and China," 1952 
edition, pp. 12-13) 
  The U.S. imperialists had planned a germ warfare against the 
Korean people from the end of 1950 and conducted living body 
experiments on prisoners of war with germ weapons manufactured 
in Japan. 
  TASS from Prague and TELEPRESS from Rangoon December 12, 
1951, reported that a warship carrying Shiro Ishii, Tsujiro 
Koetsu, Masaji Kitano and other germ experts of Japan left for 
Korea to participate in a germ warfare. (South Korean magazine 
"MAL", June 1990) 
  The U.S. imperialists killed tens of thousands of innocent 
Koreans by spreading pest, cholera, smallpox, typhoid and other 
infectious diseases with germ weapons with the help of Japan 
during the Korean war. 
  They dropped large quantities of germ weapons on Sinchon 
county of Hwanghae Province, Munchon county of Kangwon Province, 
Pyongwon, Ongchon, Yongwon and Taedong counties of South Pyongan 
Province and other areas in the February- May period of 1952. 
  Thus, Japan inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and 
sufferings 
on the Korean people by participating in the war of aggression 
in Korea started by the U.S. Imperialists, in violation of 
international laws and its "peaceful" Constitution. 
  The Japanese militarists, far from drawing a lesson from the 
history, scheme to jump into flames, pining for the days of the 
Korean war of aggression when they "acquired a windfall, 
roasting chestnut in the flames." Those who are fond of fire are 
fated to die in fire. 
  If the Japanese reactionaries expect another "shower of 
gold" 
in a "second Korean war", it is a big mistake.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies have been 
held in different parts of Korea to denounce the Japanese 
reactionaries' suppression of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan. 
  Rallies took place in Kaesong adjacent to the Military 
Demarcation Line and Sariwon, the seat of North Hwanghae 
Province, on June 22 and 23. 
  The speakers at the rallies denounced the recent raid on the 
office of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by 
Japanese police and its search of 27 places including houses of 
Chongnyon officials on charges of "violation of the national 
land utilization law" as a brigandish fascist outrage and 
political suppression which was committed in broad daylight on 
no reasonable ground. 
  They strongly demanded the Japanese authorities ponder over 
the grave consequences that might arise from their anti-DPRK, 
anti-Chongnyon campaign, immediately stop such barbaric acts, 
sincerely apologize for all their crimes and punish the 
criminals. 
  They urged the Japanese authorities to ensure the Chongnyon 
officials and Koreans in Japan all legitimate rights and 
treatment as foreigners and fully guarantee their human rights 
according to the principles of international law and 
international usage.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
Union of Korean Teachers in Japan, the Central Educational 
Association of Koreans in Japan and the Society of Mothers for 
Defending Human Rights of Students of Korean Schools published a 
joint appeal on June 24 with regard to the continuous outrages 
against Korean students in Japan and sent it to the 
secretary-general of the United Nations, the UN Human Rights 
Committee, missions of all countries in the United Nations, 
non-governmental organizations of different countries, 
international organizations and governments and lawyers' 
organizations around the world. 
  The appeal said the cases of national persecution and human 
rights abuses against Korean students in Japan totalled more 
than 120 in the period from April to June 21 and there is no 
sign of an end to such incidents. 
  It noted that such incidents have occurred mainly because 
the 
Japanese Government and news media fostered distrust and 
antagonism against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
among the people and they are an immediate product of the 
consciousness of discrimination and senses of chauvinism against 
the Korean people with which the Japanese Government authorities 
intentionally imbued the Japanese people. 
  "We urgently call on your organization (government) that 
respects justice, democracy, humanitarianism and human rights to 
urge the Japanese Government authorities to stop national 
persecution and human rights abuses against Koreans in Japan and 
immediately take effective steps to prevent such incidents. [no

  [Text] A hearing on the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula was held at a meeting of the International Affairs 
Committee of the Russian State Duma on 20 June. Participating 
in the hearing were Vladimir Lukin, chairman of International 
Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma; deputies to the 
State Duma who are members of the committee; Mikhail Titarenko, 
director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East Institute; 
functionaries of relevant sectors; and functionaries of the 
publication and reporting sector. 
  Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, and functionaries 
of 
the embassy were invited to the meeting. 
  The DPRK ambassador spoke first at the hearing, which was 
headed by the chairman of the Russian State Duma International 
Affairs Committee. He said that reports in Russian publications 
on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula were mostly 
distorted and showed sympathy with the U.S. and other Western 
countries' reports. He explained the origin of the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula and our Republic's consistent position 
and efforts to resolve it. 
  Ambassador Son Song-pil answered questions by the State Duma 
deputies and those concerned in Korean affairs. Answering the 
question related to Russia's proposal for an international 
meeting on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, he said: 
We admitted that if the international meeting proposed by 
Russia is held on the principle of equality and impartiality, if 
the DPRK-U.S. talks broke down, it can be a way to resolve the 
nuclear issue peacefully, aadding that we would study it if a 
specific plan is put forward. However, we cannot approve of it 
if you urge us to hold an international meeting while sanctions 
are imposed on us. Dialogue and sanctions are incompatible. We 
will take appropriate countermeasures against sanctions 
according to their scale. Our position is to respond to 
dialogue with dialogue and to war with war.

  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song received a 
solidarity letter from Zhirinovsky, chairman of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party, supporting our people's cause for 
peace and peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula. 
  The letter is as follows: 
  Pyongyang. 
  To DPRK President Comrade Kim Il-song: 
  Dear Comrade Kim Il-song, on behalf of the great Russian 
people and the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, which was 
chosen by the Russian people to speak for their interest, I send 
you a solidarity letter. 
  The Russian people are facing the world imperialists' 
pressure, which is being inflicted upon the fraternal DPRK, with 
anger and indignation. We, who are Russians, regard that as a 
sovereign state, the DPRK has a complete right to conduct 
voluntary science and research work to safeguard its people's 
welfare and interest. 
  I attentively studied your country's history and know very 
well that just like Russia, Korea's patriotism was not to occupy 
another country's territory, but to safeguard even an inch of 
their land. Korea has never committed an aggressive war. The 
chuche idea is a manifestation of the traditional Korean-style 
patriotism. 
  Russians are well aware of the fact that the DPRK never 
threatened another country and does not threaten another 
country, but that as a sovereign state, it will not allow anyone 
to attempt to yield the DPRK for its interest. Also, we do not 
want other countries to force their intention on the DPRK. 
  History shows that when it came time for the DPRK to defeat 
outside aggression, the Russian people sincerely helped the 
DPRK. Currently, we are supporting your policy to peacefully 
resolve the country's division. I think that the 10-point 
program of great national unity for the fatherland's 
reunification, which you put forth, is the most magnificent, 
practical, and just road for the country's reunification. 
  In the name of the Russian people, I wish that the fraternal 
Korean people can establish a national, peaceful, nonaligned, 
and neutral reunified state in the form of a confederal system 
as soon as possible. 
  [Signed] Zhirinovskiy 
  [Dated] 21 June 1994, Moscow

<F P=106> ["Comrade Kim Chong-il is Beacon of Mankind and Symbol of </F>
Anti-Imperialist Struggle" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, June 21 (KCNA) -- A.A. Rapin, secretary of 
the Central Committee of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist 
Party, had an interview with the KCNA correspondent in Moscow on 
June 20 on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the start of 
work by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  A.A. Rapin stressed: 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great man of the world, is a symbol 
of all the people who are against the scheme to establish 
international order under the manipulation of the U.S. 
imperialists, a beacon of mankind and an emblem of the 
international anti-imperialist struggle. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's start of work at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea 30 years ago 
was a historical event of epochal significance in strengthening 
and development of the WPK and in the development of the Korean 
revolution. 
  The WPK has made a distinguished contribution to the 
development on the international communist movement. 
  A clear example is that the WPK proposed to adopt the 
"Pyongyang declaration" signed by more than 210 communist and 
workers' parties and revolutionary and progressive parties of 
the world. 
  The "Pyongyang declaration" is a banner of struggle and 
victory which gives hope to human beings and arouses them to a 
new struggle. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made a great 
contribution to the development of the international communist 
movement by publishing many famous works including "The 
historical lesson in building socialism and the general line of 
our party," "On the fundamentals of revolutionary party 
building" and "Abuses of socialism are intolerable." 
  His works solemnly declared that although socialism was 
frustrated in the Soviet Union and some other countries, it 
would not change the desire of the world people for their 
liberation. 
  Works of Comrade Kim Chong-il were a powerful ideological 
weapon which practically dealt a fatal blow at the bourgeois 
propaganda campaign of the world. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, marshal of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, is an outstanding military strategist and an 
ever-victorious, iron-willed brilliant commander. 
  It is not accidental that the DPRK is fully ready to make a 
decisive counter-attack on the imperialist adventurers under the 
outstanding guidance of Comrade Marshal Kim Chong-il, supreme 
commander of the Korean Peoples' Army, at the most difficult 
time when the U.S. imperialists are scheming to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK, a small country. 
  The imperialists dare not pounce upon the DPRK because of 
the 
iron will and unrivalled grit of Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  We will actively propagandize achievements of the DPRK, the 
wisdom of the guidance of the Korean leadership in particular.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Letters were sent from 
Mozambique and Malaysia to the director general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] over Japan's 
concealment of plutonium. 
  The Mozambican committee for friendship with the people of 
the DPRK in its letter said: "The IAEA is continuously making a 
fuss about the `nuclear issue' of Korea while keeping mum about 
Japan's concealment of plutonium. This is aimed at stifling 
socialist Korea at any cost." 
  "To destroy socialist Korea where the leader, the party and 
the masses are united in one mind is no more than a foolish 
dream," said the letter, urging the IAEA to make an issue of 
Japan's concealment of plutonium and probe its truth. 
  The Malaysian action front in its letter said the IAEA 
should 
strongly urge the U.N. Security Council to take sanctions 
against Japan which is continuously stockpiling plutonium in 
defiance of world opinion and concern.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song's famous work "Answers to questions raised 
by the general director of the Latin America News Agency `PRENSA 
LATINA'" was carried by the Nepalese paper HINDU DAINIK, the 
Hungarian paper SZABADSAG and the Colombian paper VOZ. 
  A seminar on the work was held in Karachi, Pakistan. 
  In his report, Abdul Rahim Baluch, political adviser to the 
prime minister of the Sind provincial government of Pakistan, 
said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused when 
the United States shipped nuclear weapons into South Korea. 
This is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the 
DPRK, he said. 
  The United States recently manipulated the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to adopt an unreasonable "resolution" 
against the DPRK, he noted, adding that pressure can never be a 
way of resolving the issue.

today observe the 20th anniversary of the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. 
  The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two

on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, says NODONG 
SINMUN in a by-lined article. 
  Noting that the building of a new society is now being 
stepped up at a new stage in Laos, the article says: 
  A vigorous drive to modernize the country by the end of 2000 
is now under way in Laos and its face is improving. 
  Laos is actively striving to achieve regional peace and 
stability. 
  The Korean people will as ever make active efforts to 
develop 
the friendly and cooperative relations with the Laotian people. 
  A signed article of MINJU CHOSON says the Korean people are 
rejoiced over the achievements made by the Laotian people in the 
building of a new society and wish them greater stride forward 
in their future work.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Slow progress in the 
"framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States will 
have little impact on the planned meeting of the two nations' 
leaders, a ranking official at Japan's trade ministry said 
Friday. 
  "It was agreed when we resumed the talks that no deadline 
should be set for the negotiations," said the International 
Trade and Industry Ministry official. 
  The two countries are at the negotiation table to establish 
a 
new "framework" for bilateral trade, with the priority on three 
areas -- automobile and auto parts, government procurement of 
telecommunications equipment and medical equipment, and 
insurance. 
  The talks, which started last summer, ran into a deadlock in 
February but resumed in May. 
  The MITI official said Sozaburo Okamatsu, trade vice 
minister 
for international affairs, will have talks with Jeffrey Garten, 
U.S. undersecretary of commerce, for a few days from next Monday. 
  They are expected to discuss whether the discussions will 
remain incomplete at the time of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting, 
the official said. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton are scheduled to hold talks in Naples prior to the July 
8-10 annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized 
nations. 
  Negotiators in the framework talks have reached partial 
agreement on the automotive area, such as on a proposal to set 
up a third-party organization to evaluate the effects of Japan's 
market-opening measures. 
  But the two sides are still far apart on the so-called 
"objective criteria" by which to gauge foreign access to the 
Japanese market. 
  The MITI official said neither side is striving for a 
"partial agreement" in order merely to show progress before the 
Japan-U.S. summit. 
  The official said the issue of government procurement, on 
which working-level talks are scheduled for next week, is 
supposedly the area in which negotiations are showing the most 
progress.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata given at a news </F>
conference at the prime minister's residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] I have decided to resign today. Due to regrettable 
circumstances, this cabinet had no choice but to set sail as a 
minority coalition government. Though situations at home and 
abroad have been turbulent, we have put our energy into 
political reform and cooperation, and have challenged important 
tasks head-on. It has been of short duration. But we have 
acted on the 1994 budget -- in a record short time -- with the 
cooperation of both ruling and opposition parties. We have made 
preparations for implementation of the political reform-related 
laws; and we have tackled with sincerity such difficult issues 
as deregulation, economic reform, Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, and suspected North Korean nuclear programs. 
  With a society of aged soon to arrive, we have to make 
difficult decisions, and we have made appeals to the public in 
this regard. We have frankly explained the need for drastic tax 
reform in view of growing education costs and other living costs 
for the average population. I am sure that government efforts 
in these areas have earned the people's support. 
  I would like to thank the people of the nation once again 
for 
the understanding and cooperation they have given. 
  We are now at the crucial point of time in dealing with 
various reform programs, such as the implementation of the 
political reform-related laws that can begin with the 
legislation of a bill for electoral district zoning. 
  To help the economy make a prompt and steady recovery, the 
1994 budget, which was recently passed, needs to be implemented 
without loss of time. That action, along with the unemployment 
question, is considered important even by other nations. 
  There are so many things going on at home and abroad. The 
Naples Summit is another important event. We have to see what 
the so- called Group of 7 industrialized nations and Russia will 
want to do at the summit. 
  When we think about these matters, I realize we must not let 
another political vacuum occur. We remember that there was a 
blank of 20 days after the Hosokawa Cabinet resigned. It is now 
time when the government must do all it can to tackle and take 
care of all those issues. As such, I feel it very regrettable 
that a no- confidence motion against the cabinet was introduced 
at such a time. 
  But we realize that the government is a minority government. 
With so many important issues to be tackled, we have come to see 
it is necessary to establish a new and stable government. That 
indeed is the most important task right now. 
  From this perspective and from the viewpoint of enabling the 
reform to go on, I have decided to resign as prime minister. I 
think I should follow a Diet decision. Dissolving the lower 
house could be an alternative. However, that alternative will 
result in a vacuum that will last more than a month. I believe 
that situation should be avoided under the given conditions. 
  There are so many things to be done at home and abroad. I 
strongly hope that a new government will be able to overcome all 
these difficulties, complete political reform efforts, and take 
constructive actions on other pending matters. 
  In living as a politician so far, I have been a man who has 
tried to solve problems, thinking I should sacrifice myself if 
necessary. The targets or programs I am after now may be 
numerous, but I feel I again contribute to Japan in this regard, 
by sacrificing myself here. That is how I have come to this 
decision. 
  I may be leaving the government. Mr. Shizuo Inaba, my mentor 
who so earnestly called for reform in this country, wrote me 
when I was named prime minister: Mind should be as firm as a 
rock. 
  It is with this resolve that I and my colleagues will try to 
answer the call for political and other reforms. We will do 
everything possible and give up everything to do so. 
  What I want to say in conclusion is that it is now time for 
us -- the existing group [kiseiso] of politicians -- to leave 
[the political scene]. If the present kind of condition 
continues in this nation, there is no doubt distrust in politics 
will only grow. We began our endeavors for the political reform 
to remove the people's distrust in politics, but to our regret, 
the people of this nation are further distancing themselves from 
politics. 
  We should stop all the political fights, and stop fighting 
for power. We must really think about the nation and the 
Japanese people, the given national situation, and other 
countries' expectations of Japan. We must think about these 
points and respond to the expectations. 
  I sincerely hope that all of you who will face the tasks 
will 
deal with and solve them from this perspective of what we should 
do about Japan and what Japan should do in this world. 
  Once again, I would like to thank all the people of the 
nation and all of you [reporters] for support and cooperation 
given to me in the past.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata with </F>
unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime minister's 
official residence in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Dean of the Press Corps] I would like ask you some 
questions. Mr. Prime Minister, if your cabinet resigns en 
masse, political parties will move toward nominating a candidate 
for prime minister. Do you intend to become prime minister 
again? In your opening statement, you referred to a new 
government framework and said you would aim for a new government 
formed by political parties sharing the same policies. Do you 
think the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] should return 
to the ruling coalition? 
  [Hata] Regarding your first question, I think the question 
of whether or not I seek the premiership again should be left to 
the Diet. I will follow the Diet's judgment. As far as I am 
concerned, I am at zero. A way can start from there. Hence, I 
am not thinking about it at all. As for the new government, I 
hope the SDPJ will break with its status as an opposition party. 
I also hope the SDPJ will become a responsible political party 
and play its part in Japan's politics. I have wanted this since 
the Hosokawa government's inauguration and the last generation 
election was held. During the two months of my cabinet, I 
strongly urged the SDPJ to return to the coalition government 
and share the responsibility of running it. As I have just 
stated, I will leave the question of whether or not I seek the 
premiership again to the Diet. I hope everyone will think 
seriously about their country's future. 
  [Dean of the Press Corps] In your opening statement, you 
referred to a political vacuum on the eve of summit talks with 
the United States and the summit [G-7 Naples summit]. If the 
prime minister is replaced, Japan will be unable to avoid 
stagnation in politics and national strength. Mr. Prime 
Minister, you once stated that you considered dissolving the 
House of Representatives so Japan could avoid such a situation. 
Mr. Prime Minister, if a general resignation by the cabinet 
creates such a situation, how will you take responsibility for 
it? 
  [Hata] Japan was forced to host the summit [G-7 Tokyo 
summit] 
last year while the House of Representatives remained dissolved 
following the Miyazawa cabinet's defeat in a no-confidence vote 
in the Diet. If the House of Representatives is dissolved, no 
one knows for sure how the political situation will develop. I 
do not believe the House of Representatives' dissolution is a 
responsible act, and therefore, have decided not to do so. I 
once thought doing so would change public opinion by causing it 
to seek confidence in my cabinet. But no one knows what would 
result in the House of Representatives's dissolution. I want to 
avoid that based on the thinking that would lead to a loss of 
trust in Japan. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, you held 
long talks with Mr. Ozawa [Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) 
secretary general], which began last night and lasted until this 
morning. Did you and Mr. Ozawa discuss the possibility of 
dissolving the House of Representatives? 
  [Hata] We did not discuss such a possibility. What I have 
always said is that Japan's politics must be reformed. The 
centerpiece for political reform is the reform of the current 
electoral system. I have also said the current electoral system 
must be reformed to build a new political system wherein real 
political debates are held. The House of Representatives should 
not be resolved to reform the current electoral system. Given 
the economic situation and a host of issues facing Japan, the 
House of Representatives' dissolution should be avoided. I have 
also said I would not renounce my power to dissolve the House of 
Representatives under any circumstances when my cabinet clashes 
with the Diet. 
  [Hata continues] After seriously considering the 
situation, I held consultations with representatives from each 
of the parties of the coalition -- rather than saying I talked 
with Mr. Ozawa alone. We discussed what we should do to create 
a stabilized government, but eventually, during the course of 
our discussions, I came to the conclusion that the House of 
Representative's dissolution should be avoided. Since the 
no-confidence motion had been submitted, I decided to sum up my 
conclusions. I wanted to avoid a political vacuum at any cost. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, in general, when 
a cabinet is dissolved, in view of regular constitutional 
government procedures, it is natural to hand over power to the 
largest opposition party. What do you think of this? 
  [Hata] If we give power to the LDP, that will mean another 
minority government. It will be similar to my cabinet, which 
has been criticized for being a minority government. 
Unfortunately, there is no party in the Diet that has a 
majority of seats. For this reason, I do not think power should 
be given to the first opposition party. Rather than giving 
power to the opposition, the issue should be left to the Diet's 
judgment so that the people will be able to see how politics 
work. As has been pointed out, since the people cannot see what 
is going on in Japan's politics or the obstacles facing it, the 
matter should be left to the Diet -- some say it is quite 
difficult to translate the word "yudaneru" [verb, leave or 
entrust] -- and follow the Diet's judgment. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The no-confidence motion has been 
submitted. What was the underlying reason for your cabinet's 
resignation, even before a vote on the no-confidence motion was 
taken? 
  [Hata] If we accept the vote on the no-confidence motion, we 
must have the power to reject the motion, or at least, to make 
efforts to reject it. However, since my cabinet is a minority 
government, it is very difficult to reject the motion with our 
current power. We can no longer spend the time needed for a 
vote. It will also take much time to create the next government. 
We should avoid spending such time. For this reason, I have 
decided to take action before a vote is taken. 
  [Dean of Press Corps] The last question please. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you stated it is 
time to put an end to political strife. There is no persuasive 
force in what you said because you yourself used to get involved 
in political strife when you were an LDP member. What is your 
opinion on this? 
  [Hata] I would like you to review my 25 year political 
career. I have always thought of nothing but the nation. During 
the so-called 40-day strife within the LDP, wherein such 
influential leaders as Eiichi Nishimura, Susumu Nikaido, Shin 
Kanemaru, and Noboru Takeshita, were involved, I refuted them, 
saying that what they were thinking was unclear to the people. 
I then personally told them that I would take new action. What 
happened at that time is widely known. Moreover, I have 
repeatedly said that it is necessary to take the initiative in 
managing the government. I am a man who has never acted to seek 
his own authority or higher gain. If you check the details of my 
political career over the past 20 years, you will understand 
what I have done. I am sorry I cannot explain these things now, 
but I do want you to review what I have done. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you said at a 
press conference yesterday that you leave the matter of 
negotiations between the ruling parties and the SDPJ. But now 
you have announced your cabinet's dissolution before letting us 
know what went on at the meeting between the ruling parties and 
the SDPJ. Can we take your announcement as a full acceptance of 
Mr. Murayama's call for a voluntary resignation? 
  [Hata] In a meeting with the SDPJ -- I do not remember 
clearly what time it was -- there were no big differences in 
policy matters. But on other issues, we failed to reach an 
agreement at the meeting -- I think it was around 0400 or 0500 
PM. Given the situation, the ruling coalition presented our 
policy accord proposal to each party. This time, however, each 
party still had doubts as to the direction the situation would 
go, even though the no-confidence motion had been submitted. 
Under such circumstances, it was impossible to bring 
negotiations with the SDPJ to a successful conclusion. 
Prolonging such a situation is not good for the people, and 
therefore, I chose to dissolve my cabinet en masse. I strongly 
hope the other parties will understand my true intentions. I 
have made a decision not to comply with somebody's intention but 
to avoid a political vacuum. Pursuing the SDPJ's cause of 
breakup from the coalition will eventually lead to a political 
vacuum. I came to the conclusion that the Diet's judgment 
should be followed, and I made the decision. It's time to end. 
Thank you very much.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Prime minister Tsutomu Hata 
announced Saturday [25 June] he will disband his two-month-old 
cabinet to break the current impasse in Japanese politics. 
  "I will resign with my cabinet en masse today," the prime 
minister told a hastily convened news conference at his official 
residence. 
  Hata, 58, said his decision to give up the premiership is 
based on his firm belief that a "political vacuum" should be 
avoided as Japan faces a host of domestic and international 
challenges. 
  The resignation of the Hata Cabinet was to be approved at an 
emergency cabinet meeting which got under way immediately 
following the announcement. 
  The decision to disband the two-month-old minority coalition 
government was taken just hours before the House of 
Representatives was to convene a plenary session to vote on a 
no-confidence motion submitted by the No. 1 opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will 
entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the 
Diet," Hata told the press conference. 
  "If the lower house is dissolved, there will arise a 
political vacuum and it becomes impossible to tide over the 
yen's appreciation and other problems," he said. "I want to 
avoid a political vacuum by every means." 
  The decision on resignation en bloc was made at a meeting of 
coalition leaders earlier in the day and it was agreed to allow 
the two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), both in the opposition camp, to form a new government, 
coalition sources said. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said the development was 
what his party has demanded, adding it will seek to forge a 
third coalition government. 
  Coalition and SDP leaders failed to bridge their policy gap 
in two days of on-and-off realliance talks. 
  The Hata government was formed in April after its 
predecessor, headed by Morihiro Hosokawa, collapsed in a dispute 
over the former prime minister's alleged shady financial 
dealings. 
  The SDP, partner in the Hosokawa coalition that ousted the 
LDP from power after 38 years of uninterrupted rule, left the 
ruling alliance after Hosokawa quit. 
  The no-confidence motion that was threatening to scuttle the 
Hata administration was widely expected to clear the 511-seat 
lower house with the backing of the LDP and the Japanese 
Communist Party, which jointly command a parliamentary strength 
of 221 votes, and some other parties.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
resigned on Saturday [25 June] together with his cabinet 
ministers in lieu of calling a snap general election and 
creating a political vacuum at a time when Japan faces a number 
of formidable challenges. 
  "I will resign with my cabinet en masse today," the premier 
said at a hurriedly convened news conference at his official 
residence. 
  "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will 
entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the 
Diet," Hata said. 
  The 58-year-old Hata said he decided to give up the 
premiership because he wished to avoid contesting a general poll 
for the House of Representatives and creating a political vacuum 
before this year's summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major 
industrialized nations. 
  "If the lower house is dissolved, there will arise a 
political vacuum and it becomes impossible to tide over the 
yen's appreciation and other problems," he said. "I want to 
avoid a political vacuum by every means." 
  Hata's two-month-old cabinet formally resigned en masse 
after 
the premier's announcement of his intention to step down, but 
Hata and his cabinet will stay on board until the Diet picks the 
next prime minister. 
  Hata reached the decision to disband the minority coalition 
government shortly before the lower house was to convene a 
plenary session to vote on a no-confidence motion filed by the 
primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The no-confidence motion was expected to clear the 
511-member 
lower chamber after negotiations failed between the ruling 
coalition and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a former 
coalition member, to form a new government. 
  The socialists, the largest contingent in the last Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government who walked out of the 
coalition in April, also had threatened to submit its own 
no-confidence motion. 
  Hata acknowledged he thought it difficult for his minority 
government to vote down the motion and opted to disband his 
cabinet before the motion was put to a floor vote. 
  During days of negotiations between the coalition and the 
SDP, the socialists sought as a prerequisite for their return to 
the ruling union the mass resignation of the Hata Cabinet on a 
voluntary basis. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said the development was 
what his party had demanded, adding it will seek to forge a 
third coalition government. 
  Hata expressed hope the SDP will develop into a new party 
that takes responsible action in Japanese politics, not as a 
mere opposition party. 
  Meanwhile, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori expressed hope 
his party will play a central role in a new government on the 
grounds that the LDP is the largest single party in the Diet. 
  "As long as Hata said he will leave the issue of forming a 
new administration to the will of the Diet, we have to govern as 
the No. 1 party," Mori told reporters. 
  The LDP lost power last summer for the first time in 38 
years 
after failing to secure a majority in the lower house in a 
general election. 
  Following Hata's resignation, the lower house decided to 
hold 
a plenary session at 1 p.m. Monday, where the next premier can 
be selected at the earliest. 
  The current 150-day ordinary session of the Diet is 
scheduled 
to end next Wednesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Saturday briefed South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on his resignation along with his cabinet ministers, a 
Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Hata, who announced the resignation of his entire cabinet 
Saturday morning, telephoned Kim and expressed his hope to visit 
South Korea and meet with Kim some day, the official said. 
  During the 15-minute conversation, the premier expressed 
confidence his departure would not hurt relations between Japan 
and South Korea, the official said. 
  Hata disbanded his two-month-old minority government to 
avoid 
certain defeat in a no-confidence vote, as well as a snap 
general election and political vacuum that would follow. 
  Kim, thanking Hata for his telephone call, was quoted as 
saying he is willing to meet with Hata any time to compare notes 
on a wide range of issues. 
  The South Korean president also reportedly voiced his desire 
to further strengthen bilateral ties with Japan. 
  To defuse the standoff over North Korea's alleged push for 
nuclear arms, Hata and Kim agreed on the need to realize a 
summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea and 
resume the third round of talks between North Korea and the 
United States on Pyongyang's nuclear program, the official said.

  [Text] Washington, June 25 KYODO -- The administration of 
President Bill Clinton expressed regret Saturday [25 June] over 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's announcement of 
resignation but said Washington will maintain a close working 
relationship with Tokyo. 
  "We regret the decision," White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee 
Myers said in a statement, referring to the disbandment of the 
two-month-old minority government earlier in the day. 
  "President Clinton and Prime Minister Hata enjoyed a good 
working relationship," Myers said. "The United States will 
continue to work closely with the government of Japan as only 
allies and friends can at a moment of political change." 
  Hata's Cabinet resigned en bloc to pave the way for a new 
coalition with majority support rather than calling a snap 
general election. 
  Hata will stay in office at the head of a caretaker 
administration until a new government is formed.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Saturday [25 June] the current tax reform policy will 
not change even with the resignation of the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Fujii told a press conference held immediately after the 
cabinet resigned that he expects the succeeding administration 
will continue to seek a higher consumption tax and lower income 
taxes, so as to prepare for the aging society. 
  He said he hoped the final draft on the issue will be 
compiled as soon as possible in line with earlier plans to 
create a final version by the end of June. 
  Hata gave up his two-month-old cabinet just hours before the 
House of Representatives was to convene to vote on a 
no-confidence motion against his administration. 
  Fujii acknowledged the political turmoil will not be good 
for 
the economy which is trying to crawl out of the recession. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told 
reporters that the tax issue is already the next 
administration's problem. 
  But Kumagai said the present administration is willing to 
wrap up the deregulation plan, which is expected to be unveiled 
next Tuesday in line with the March market-access program.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata 
expressed the hope Saturday [25 June] that the political vacuum 
following the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
Cabinet will not affect ongoing Japan-U.S. negotiations for a 
new framework for bilateral trade. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who came to power only two 
months ago, decided to resign with his cabinet en masse Saturday 
only a few hours before the House of Representatives was to vote 
on a no- confidence motion submitted by the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
  The minister of international trade and industry told 
reporters after the extraordinary cabinet meeting to decide on 
the resignation that a psychological impact on the Japan-U.S. 
trade talks is unavoidable. 
  He expressed hope that a new cabinet will be formed as soon 
as possible to tackle the issue, adding that a broad policy 
accord has already been reached and the basic approach toward 
the conclusion of the talks will not change. 
  He said a package of economic deregulation measures to be 
completed by the government toward the end of the month will be 
carried out as scheduled.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Japanese business leaders 
Saturday welcomed prime minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to 
disband his two-month-old cabinet en masse in an effort to avoid 
a political vacuum which would have occurred in the event of a 
general election. 
  "That was the best decision that Mr. Hata could make" just 
half an hour before the House of Representatives was to have 
voted on a no-confidence motion against his cabinet, said 
Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren). 
  Citing many difficult problems facing Japan ahead of the 
July 
8-10 summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in 
Naples, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) said, "The Diet should elect 
a new prime minister to carry forward upcoming political reform 
policies without taking any retracting steps." 
  "A general election would create a political vacuum for 
almost one month. That would be a worst scenario for Japan, 
which is only just beginning to see some signs of economic 
recovery," Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., said, 
expressing his relief. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chief of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, another influential business group, said, "A new 
government is required to make utmost efforts to salvage the 
ailing economy and promote administrative and tax reforms." 
  But Makoto Murata, head of the Japan Petrochemical Industry 
Association, voiced his perplexity over the ongoing political 
uncertainty, which he said would have adverse effects on 
currency and stock markets and on business activities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of </F>
Shinseito, Japan Renewal Party, by unidentified NHK reporter at 
the Shinseito headquarters in Tokyo -- live via satellite; from 
the "NHK News" program] 
  [Text] [NHK] What do you think of Prime Minister Hata's 
decision on the general resignation of his cabinet? 
  [Watanabe] I shed tears of regret. Mr. Hata has stressed the 
need to push for political reform. He has asserted that 
politicians must practice politics not for themselves, but for 
the people, and they must place importance on the people over 
themselves. This is a political belief that he has held for the 
25 years of his career as a politician. Given his political 
belief, it is natural for him to made that decision. 
  [NHK] I would like to ask you how the ruling coalition 
parties plan to form a new coalition government after the Hata 
cabinet resigns en masse. Will the ruling coalition parties 
resume talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] to discuss the SDPJ's return to the ruling 
coalition? 
  [Watanabe] The ruling coalition parties are continuing talks 
with the SDPJ. The SDPJ's biggest demand is that the Hata 
cabinet must resign en masse and then new political forces must 
be rallied to form a new coalition government. The SDPJ and the 
ruling coalition parties formed the Hosokawa government with the 
aim of preparing Japan for the 21st century. The SDPJ voted for 
Mr. Hata as prime minister in both houses of the Diet. The SDPJ 
did not join the Hata cabinet for ceretain reasons. I have 
confidence that the ruling coalition parties will continue talks 
with the SDPJ about how to form a new coalition government in 
order not to set Japan's politics back. 
  [NHK] How about the possibility of the ruling coalition 
parties forging a coalition with the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party? 
  [Watanabe] In the news conference that was held just a while 
ago, Prime Minister Hata stated: The industrial nations' summit 
draws nearer. Political parties should not think only of their 
interests and should place top priority on the people over 
themselves. I hope that the next government will be formed in 
tune with the will of the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- The primary strategist of 
the ruling coalition, Ichiro Ozawa, on Sunday [26 June] denied 
the possibility that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will return to 
power. 
  "A result that derails common sense is not to be expected," 
Ozawa told reporters. 
  Hata and his cabinet ministers resigned en masse Saturday 
prior to a possible defeat in a no-confidence vote against his 
cabinet tabled by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the 
largest opposition party. 
  Earlier Sunday, another key coalition figure Yuichi 
Ichikawa, 
secretary general of Komeito [Clean Government Party], also said 
"I don't think Mr. Hata will become prime minister again and he 
himself probably thinks similarly." 
  Ozawa said it would be natural to extend the term of the 
current 150-day regular Diet session, which closes on Wednesday, 
if the Diet fails to nominate a new prime minister. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], also urged the LDP and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the No. 2 opposition bloc, to offer their own vision of a 
new government to succeed Hata's minority coalition 
administration. 
  "Both the LDP and the SDP should put to the people their 
blueprints for establishing the next government because it is 
they who pressed the Hata cabinet to resign... We will wait for 
those blueprints," Ozawa said. 
  Ozawa said the resignation of Hata and his cabinet was not 
intended to meet the SDP's demand that the cabinet resign 
voluntarily as a prerequisite for its rejoining the coalition.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0109 GMT on 26 June, during its regular "Sunday 
Discussion" program carries a live interview with Kozo Watanabe, 
deputy secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] from 
the NHK studio in Tokyo. Watanabe is interviewed by Takashi 
Yamamoto, NHK commentator, and Naoki Tanaka, noted economic 
commentator. 
  Asked by Yamamoto to comment on Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's 
resignation, Watanabe says it was an inevitable choice by the 
minority government. He explains that at the moment, the 
coalition parties would rather take a wait-and-see attitude on 
how the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] will react, and would not actively seek to 
regain political power. 
  Answering Tanaka's question on what caused the failure of 
the 
Hata administration, while Watanabe admits that the issue of the 
"Kaishin" group was not handled properly, he emphasizes that the 
administration as a whole, and Hata personally, were not at 
fault, and even claims that the resignation itself "has not 
damaged Mr. Hata's reputation in any way." 
  However, when asked by Yamamoto if Shinseito is actually 
expecting Hata to be reelected as prime minister, Watanabe 
denies this, saying the sole reason behind the resignation was 
Hata's desire not to create a political vacuum when the Naples 
Summit is held in July, as in the case of the summit last year. 
He also stresses the importance of talking with the SDPJ at 
this point. 
  As to Shinseito's strategy in dealing with the present 
political situation, Watanabe refuses to go into detail, saying 
Shinseito will decide on this after looking at how the LDP and 
SDPJ react. He expresses a willingness to talk with all 
political parties, except the Japan Communist Party. He also 
denies reports that Shinseito actually wants to form an alliance 
with certain forces both in the LDP and SDPJ to effect a general 
reconfiguration of political forces immediately. However, he 
does not deny political realignment is a future goal if 
Shinseito and the other coalition parties become the opposition, 
and a general election is held. 
  Turning to the possibility of forming an alliance with 
rebellious LDP and SDPJ members to form a new majority 
government, Watanabe replies indirectly: "In politics, it is 
important for people who have similar political ideals and 
policy concepts to work together. I believe many SDPJ members 
seriously want to promote political reform and to create 
politics for a new era. There are also such people in the LDP. 
I think it is important to form a new political force for the 
next era with such people." 
  Asked by Tanaka if such an alliance is likely to materialize 
before the next prime minister is elected, Watanabe admits that 
the present situation is such that no one can tell what will 
happen next. However, he terms the present confusion as labor 
pains preceding the birth of new political norms. 
  The interview ends at 1020 GMT.

  [Text] In response to the Hata cabinet's resignation, the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is now holding an 
emergency executive meeting to discuss ways to form a new 
coalition government. The LDP forced the Hata cabinet to resign 
en masse by submitting a no-confidence motion to the Diet, 
claiming the Hata cabinet was a minority government that did not 
represent the people's will. The LDP is taking the Hata 
cabinet's resignation as a matter of course. Asserting that it 
would like to form a stable coalition government with other 
political parties, the LDP intends to discuss ways to form a new 
coalition government with the other parties. 
  Speaking with a group of reporters this morning, LDP 
Secretary General Mori said Prime Minister Hata had said he 
would leave the formation of the next government to the Diet, 
and being the largest party, the LDP will call on other parties 
to cooperate with it in doing so. 
  While some LDP members would like to create an alliance with 
the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in 
forming the next government, former Foreign Minister Watanabe is 
asserting the framework of the next government must be based on 
policies, indicating his caution about the LDP forging an 
alliance with the SDPJ. The LDP is expected to be divided over 
how to construct the next government's framework.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) proposed to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ 
-- of Japan] Saturday [25 June] its version of policy guidelines 
for a new government that would succeed the administration of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono and Ryutaro Hashimoto, chief of the 
party's Policy Research Council, met with SDP chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama and presented him with the policy draft that the LDP 
drew up in an attempt to forge a new coalition to replace the 
Hata cabinet which stepped down en mass Saturday morning, party 
sources said. 
  The LDP, which dominated Japan's politics for 38 years, 
became the primary opposition party last August after it failed 
to retain a majority in the Diet following the July elections of 
the powerful House of Representatives. 
  LDP officials said the LDP, still Japan's largest political 
party, also presented its policy draft to Hata's Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government Party] and 
other parties. 
  The SDP, which was a leading bloc in the administration of 
Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, abandoned the coalition 
in April to become the second-largest opposition party after a 
feud with its coalition partners over a new intraparliamentary 
group excluding the SDP. 
  The LDP's policy proposals are made up of seven points -- 
political reform, administrative reform, foreign affairs and 
national security, economic measures, social welfare, 
agriculture and education, the sources said. 
  The draft proposals spelled out that a new government will 
eradicate the exclusivity and selfishness in the decision-making 
process, the sources said. 
  Concerning North Korea's suspected nuclear program, the 
draft 
proposals said that Japan will make efforts to resolve the issue 
peacefully through cooperation with the United States, China, 
South Korea and Russia under the flag of the United Nations. 
  The policy proposals did not refer to "emergency 
legislation" 
to deal with crises, which has divided the political parties, 
but mildly said the government will take as many steps as it can 
to manage the country's security, they said. 
  The LDP has also pledged to take steps to ride out Japan's 
prolonged economic slump and help reduce Japan's huge current 
account surplus. 
  The ruling coalition parties, meanwhile, agreed Saturday 
that 
they will cease reconciliation talks with the SDP and see how 
the LDP, as the leading opposition party, will move to form a 
new government, coalition officials said.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2238 GMT on 25 June during its weekly "News 2001" 
program, carries a live 19-minute interview with Yoshiro Mori, 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general, by FNN 
announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Megumi Seki, political commentator 
Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki 
Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo. 
  When asked about the LDP's strategy for taking power and the 
possibility of the LDP allying with the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan (SDPJ), Mori says: "It is important for the LDP to 
hold talks with various parties from now on. Although the LDP 
does not intend to take an arrogant attitude, the fact is, that 
although the LDP did not win a majority, it did win a large 
number of votes in the (House of Representatives) election last 
year. In this sense, it is very important to establish an 
administration that reflects the people's will." Noting the LDP 
has been making efforts to reform itself and that the party is 
responsible for managing politics, Mori says: "We would like to 
hold talks with various parties to seek their understanding." 
He adds that the LDP may not start discussion with the 
coalition immediately because of a 25 June meeting, during which 
Komeito (Clean Government Party) Secretary General Ichikawa told 
him that the coalition wanted to cautiously watch the situation 
for the time being. 
  At 2242 GMT, Kuroiwa asks whether or not the LDP will put 
forward party president Yohei Kono as a candidate for the next 
prime minister. Mori replies: "As Mr. Kono is the LDP 
president, our party intends to field him in the premiership 
election. However, several cards will be revealed during talks 
(with other parties). Even if the LDP insists on the LDP card, 
others may not agree to it. In this case, it cannot be helped." 
The program then shows a brief recorded comment by LDP member 
Takeshi Noda, who stresses the need to establish an 
administration headed by LDP President Kono. Mori says the best 
thing for the LDP to do is to form an administration headed by 
the LDP, and adds it is also important for the party to 
participate in an administration. Asked about the possibility 
of forming an LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake (Harbinger) coalition and the 
possibility of Sakigake Representative Masayoshi Takemura 
running for prime minister, Mori says: "One option is that 
various parties will reach a consensus on a decision." 
Reviewing the past LDP structure, Mori says the LDP is now 
changing itself. 
  Asked whether the next administration will be a full-fledged 
one or an interim one for dealing with the current situation, 
Mori says: "We should not seek an interim administration." On 
the possibility of the lower house's dissolution and a general 
election, he says Mr. Hata's decision to resign (to avoid a 
lower house dissolution) was right because a political vacuum 
would affect the economy. He adds it is necessary to convene an 
extraordinary Diet session this fall to enact political 
reform-related bills, including the redistricting bill, to 
further promote political reform. 
  At 2249 GMT, Takao Iwami, a MAINICHI SHIMBUN special 
editorial adviser, phones in from a Shibuy hotel to give his 
view on the LDP stance, stating the LDP lacks a strong eagerness 
to take power. 
  At 2250 GMT, Kuroiwa points out the ambiguity of LDP 
policies 
toward taking power. Mori says: "I do not think there are 
large differences among various parties on policies, especially 
domestic affairs. It is important to leave room for discussions 
with other parties." Discussing the consumption tax hike, Mori 
says it is necessary to seek public understanding on the issue. 
But, he adds: "I think the consumption tax hike should be 
avoided at the present in view of the current economic 
situation." He says it is necessary to promote administrative 
reform by 2010, while working with our welfare policies. 
  The interview with Mori concludes at 2257 GMT.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0046 GMT on 26 June carries a 22-minute live 
interview with Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], during its regular "Sunday Discussion" program. 
The interview, conducted in the NHK Tokyo studio, is moderated 
by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and guest commentator Naoki 
Tanaka. 
  Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Kono: "As the 
largest opposition party, the LDP bears great responsibility for 
establishing a new administration. How do you intend to tackle 
this in concrete terms?" Kono replies: "We need to follow an 
orthodox procedure. I think one of the reasons for the current 
confusion in the political situation lies in the fact that 
proper the procedures of parliamentary democracy have not been 
taken in an orthodox manner. I mean, the regular procedures of 
constitutional government." Explaining the differences between 
the presidential system and the parliamentary system of 
government, Kono reiterates that it is important to follow 
orthodox procedures based on the parliamentary system of 
government and parliamentary democracy. Asked whether the 
largest opposition LDP intends to call for policy talks with the 
second largest opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan 
(SDPJ), Kono says: "I think the opposition parties are 
responsible for disentangling the political chaos." 
  Yamamoto then asks: "Do you mean the most desirable thing is 
to form an LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake (Harbinger) coalition?" 
  Kono replies: "Theoretically, yes." He then notes the need 
to reach an agreement on polices. 
  Guest commentator Tanaka next asks if Kono feels the 
responsibility for forming a new administration. Kono says: "I 
feel a very grave responsibility." Then Kono says the initial 
reason for the LDP submission of a no-confidence motion against 
the Hata cabinet was not because it was a minority 
administration. In citing the actual reasons, Kono asserts that 
the Hata administration had injured Japan's credit with foreign 
nations and the administration was taking a negative attitude 
toward economic pump-priming measures and political reform. 
Kono adds: "Now that we have brought down the administration, 
we -- not only the LDP but also the others who brought it down 
-- bear a great responsibility. Therefore, we intend to call for 
talks with various parties. Each coalition party that has lost 
power has their own opinion. For this reason, we intend to ask 
each party to talk with us. However, we have to think about 
which party has the most similar views to ours on the current 
politics. Policies are important, but, democracy is more 
important." 
  Noting LDP criticism of the so-called Ozawa-Ichikawa 
alliance 
(between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa), Yamamoto asks if the LDP 
intends to exclude Shinseito and Komeito from policy talks. 
Kono says the LDP has no intention of excluding them from the 
initial stage if they follow democracy. On policy differences 
between the LDP and the SDPJ, Kono says he has the impression 
that there are not many differences in policies between the LDP 
and the SDPJ. 
  When Tanaka points out different views within the LDP, Kono 
says: "As I was elected party president, I represent LDP views." 
Asked how he intends to consolidate party unity, Kono says the 
LDP members have become united over the year since he became 
party president. Asked about the so-called 
"conservative-conservative" coalition, Kono questions the term 
"conservative-conservative" coalition. 
  Tanaka reviews the LDP's past political management, and asks 
what Kono thinks about the leadership within the LDP. Kono 
says: "The LDP has been reformed smoothly. The party has 
drastically changed compared with last year." He adds: "The 
biggest change is that the there is no more faction-oriented 
management in the LDP." 
  Asked about Sakigake's idea of putting forward SDPJ Chairman 
Murayama as candidate for premiership, Kono says it is desirable 
to think about various options, and notes the need for a 
transparent procedure for deciding the candidate. Kono adds: 
"It took much time to establish the Hata administration after 
Mr. Hosokawa (resigned as prime minister). At present, this is 
by no means forgivable. We have only three days before the 
current Diet session ends. And, the summit meeting (in Naples) 
is near at hand. Although we can extend the Diet session, it is 
impossible to postpone the summit. I think we have to make a 
decision in a day or two." When Yamamoto asks whether Kono will 
be a candidate for prime minister if an LDP headed 
administration is formed, Kono says it is not time to jump to 
conclusions. Kono adds that it is very important to reach a 
policy agreement with other parties on such issues as tax reform 
and security. 
  Asked about the coalition's stance of watching developments 
in LDP-SDPJ talks, Kono says: "It is an orthodox attitude. If 
Mr. Hata's resignation was based on the belief that he could not 
survive a no-confidence motion, it will be impossible for Mr. 
Hata to be reelected prime minister again." 
  Yamamoto asks: "Do you mean Mr. Hata will not become prime 
minister again?" Kono asserts: "I think it is impossible." 
  The interview with Kono ends at 0108 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) and the second largest opposition Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- 
SDPJ] are going to hold a party head meeting Monday [27 June] 
morning following the resignation of the entire minority cabinet 
of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, party officials said. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
are scheduled to meet at 10 AM at the Diet building, the 
officials said. The LDP has proposed a summit meeting among 
leaders of the LDP, the SDP and the new party Sakigake on 
Sunday. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made the proposal at 
a meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo. 
  Mori told Kubo the LDP intends to settle the latest 
political 
chaos with the three parties. Mori added that a new prime 
minister should be chosen as soon as possible, the officials 
said. 
  Later in the day, the SDP decided to accept the LDP's 
proposal at a party leadership meeting, the officials said. But 
the New Party Sakigake has not immediately accepted the 
proposal. Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake, said 
in a meeting with Mori that Sakigake will watch consultations 
between the LDP and the SDP, they said. 
  The LDP earlier the same day decided to set a priority on 
consultations with the SDP and Sakigake toward setting up a new 
government at a party leadership meeting, the officials said. 
  LDP President Kono has showed the willingness for a tie-up 
between the LDP and the SDP together with Sakigake during a TV 
program on Sunday morning. 
  SDP Chairman Murayama said Sunday during a TV program that 
he 
will also consider a possible tie-up between the LDP and the 
SDP. However, SDP's Kubo told reporters after the meeting with 
Mori that the proposed summit meeting does not mean the start of 
consultations toward setting up a new government. Kubo also 
said the SDP is ready to propose a meeting with outgoing Prime 
Minister Hata representing the coalition. 
  Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Hata's 
Shinseito, appeared to reject consultations with the SDP over 
realliance for the time being. Ozawa urged the LDP and the SDP 
to offer their own vision of a new government to succeed Hata's 
minority coalition administration.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The heads of Japan's two 
biggest opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party 
of Japan -- SDPJ] met Monday morning to discuss the political 
impasse after the resignation of the cabinet of prime minister 
Tsutomu Hata, SDP party officials said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters after the 
43-minute meeting he and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed on an 
early settlement of the political chaos following the wholesale 
resignation of the minority cabinet. Prior to the start of the 
meeting, the SDP leadership meeting decided they will not 
discuss forming an alliance or a new government to replace the 
Hata cabinet, SDP officials said. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori also told reporters the 
two parties are not entering policy talks toward setting up a 
new government. The SDP is also seeking a meeting with Prime 
Minister Hata, the representative of the ruling coalition, the 
officials said. The LDP proposed the meeting with the SDP on 
Sunday. 
  SDP Chairman Murayama said Sunday during a television 
interview he would consider a tie-up with the LDP. However, SDP 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo appeared to favor returning to the 
ruling coalition, party sources said. 
  The SDP withdrew from former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's coalition cabinet in late April to protest the 
formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition partners 
that excluded the SDP. The move forced Hata to form the first 
minority government in nearly four decades.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Leaders of Japan's two main 
opposition parties on Monday [27 June] agreed on the need to 
form a new government by the end of Tuesday, but they failed to 
come up with a plan of action to achieve that end. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the biggest opposition 
group, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic 
Party of Japan -- SDPJ] agreed that the two parties bear great 
responsibility to get the current political turmoil under 
control, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news 
conference. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
"shared a view that a new prime minister should be elected 
before the end of June 28," said Kubo, the No. 2 man of the SDP. 
"But our stances to have the situation in hand are not 
necessarily the same," Kubo said, indicating there would be no 
immediate formation of a coalition government by the two parties. 
  With Japan facing serious issues at home and abroad, and the 
summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized 
economies approaching, it is crucial to pick a new premier and 
launch a new government as quickly as possible, Kono and 
Murayama agreed, according to Kubo. 
  The meeting of the leaders of the LDP and the SDP came two 
days after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his two-month-old 
minority government resigned. During the 40-minute meeting, 
Kono called on Murayama to consider the opening of new 
government negotiations with New Party Sakigake, in addition to 
negotiations with the LDP, Kubo said. The SDP and Sakigake, 
both former members of the ruling coalition, have already kicked 
off talks on a joint policy platform to be released soon. 
  Asked about the possibility of a new government being 
launched by Tuesday, Kubo replied, "I cannot tell." "In the 
case of a single-party government, you can tell the schedule. 
But as for a coalition government, you cannot start until it is 
known which parties will share the government," he said. 
  Kubo revealed that he has proposed via Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai holding a meeting between Hata and 
Murayama to explore the possibility of the SDP forming a new 
government with the current ruling coalition. The coalition 
must be weighing how to respond to the offer, he said. 
  Hata resigned with his minority government Saturday in the 
face of an LDP-proposed no-confidence motion and an SDP demand 
for the collective resignation of his cabinet as a prerequisite 
for the SDP's return to the ruling camp. The coalition insists 
it is the LDP and the SDP that should chart a course for the 
formation of a new government, not the coalition. 
  Although some LDP and SDP leaders have voiced readiness for 
a 
tie-up of the two parties to succeed the Hata government, 
resistance to such an alliance is strong within both parties as 
they have sharp differences on key policy issues. Notably, the 
SDP central executive committee has decided not to ally with the 
LDP. 
  Kubo, who favors the SDP rejoining the ruling coalition, 
asserted that the party should follow the committee decision as 
it examines ways to form a new government. "I have been told by 
party members to abide by the central executive committee 
decision and I myself have followed the decision sincerely," 
kubo said. "The decision must be observed by all means," he 
said. 
  The House of Representatives steering committee canceled a 
lower house plenary session scheduled for 1PM [0400 GMT] because 
the parliament was not prepared to pick a successor to Prime 
Minister Hata, committee sources said.

  Hata and his cabinet resigned Saturday prior to impending 
defeat in a no-confidence vote against his two-month old cabinet 
tabled by the LDP. 
  Hata is the sixth prime minister in Japan to have resigned 
in 
five years. 
  Kubo told reporters after the meeting with Mori that the 
country's two largest parties in parliament, the LDP and the 
SDP, will discuss how to break the current political deadlock. 
  The two parties however will not proceed to consultations on 
forming a new coalition government, Kubo said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [SDPJ -- of Japan] and New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] will 
weigh the possibility of issuing a joint appeal to form a new 
government, officials of the two parties said Monday [27 June]. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake Chief Masayoshi 
Takemura met in the Diet building for nearly an hour to discuss 
what course of action their parties should take in launching a 
new government to replace that of outgoing prime minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  The two men agreed their parties will consider the joint 
action, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Administration 
Committee, and Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda told a 
joint news conference. 
  Takemura told Murayama that his party will not participate 
in 
a new government if it is led by the new intraparliamentary 
group Kaishin and Soka Gakkai-backed Komeito [Clean Government 
Party]. 
  Kaishin's members include Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New 
Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  Earlier Monday, the SDP, the second largest opposition 
party, 
and Sakigake agreed in principle on a blueprint for a fresh 
administration that calls for among other things respect for the 
Constitution. 
  Nosaka said the SDP and Sakigake, both former members of 
the ruling coalition, should make further efforts to stabilize 
Japan's political situation, give a sense of security to the 
public and win the trust of other countries. 
  Sonoda told reporters that Takemura briefed Murayama on his 
party's position of recommending the SDP chief as top candidate 
for the premiership. Murayama, however, demurred, Sonoda said. 
  To form a "dovish" government, Nosaka said, the next prime 
minister should be served by people who are sincere, courageous 
and decisive. 
  The dovish nature of the government should be represented by 
Japan's international contributions in nonmilitary fields, 
Sonoda said. 
  Saying the SDP is awaiting Hata's reply to the SDP's call 
for 
a meeting between the premier and Murayama, Nosaka displayed his 
readiness to further urge Hata to meet the SDP boss and discuss 
the framework of the next administration. 
  Hata and his two-month-old cabinet resigned Saturday in the 
face of a no-confidence motion. 
  The socialists formed the largest contingent in the previous 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Takemura 
served as chief cabinet secretary. 
  Meanwhile, the democrats, a faction within the SDP, agreed 
Monday to oppose an intraparty move to create a coalition 
government with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the 
country's largest party now in opposition, faction officials 
said. 
  The democrats, a policy study group, which comprises 23 SDP 
legislators of the House of Representatives, also urged the SDP 
leadership to resume talks with Hata's coalition to form yet 
another coalition government, the officials said. 
  The decision was adopted at a plenary session of the 
democrats, they said. The democrats have long thrown their 
weight behind SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who is regarded 
as a chief proponent of an alliance with the coalition. 
  Following the announcement Saturday of the premier's 
intention to disband his entire cabinet, SDP ranks have been 
divided over the wisdom of proposals to seek an alliance with 
the LDP or return to the fold of the ruling coalition.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report: from "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Text] The opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] held an extraordinary meeting of the Central Executive 
Committee this morning to discuss how to deal with a 
no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet which has been 
submitted by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to 
the Diet. During the meeting, a group of legislators led by 
Chairman Murayama asserted that the SDPJ should submit its own 
no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet in line with a 
party decision that if the Hata cabinet refuses to resign en 
masse, the SDPJ will demand the dissolution of the House of 
Representatives and the holding of general elections, while a 
group of legislators led by Secretary General Kubo claimed that 
the SDPJ should vote against the no-confidence motion or abstain 
from the vote, noting the importance of the SDPJ maintaining its 
relationship with the coalition government. In this way, the two 
groups split over handling the coalition government and as a 
result, the SDPJ was unable to shape a consensus at the meeting. 
  SDPJ legislators held a meeting shortly after Prime Minister 
Hata announced that his cabinet would resign en masse. During 
the meeting, Secretary General Kubo said: As a result, the Hata 
cabinet will voluntarily resign en masse as the SDPJ has 
demanded. I intend to do my best to form a new coalition 
government. 
  His remarks indicate that the climate has now been created 
wherein the SDPJ can resume talks with the ruling coalition 
parties about the SDPJ's return to the coalition government. 
  Chairman Murayama, however, said: Each political party and 
each parliamentary group will make moves, and it is important 
for the SDPJ to adopt perfect policies. I will do everything I 
can to meet the party's expectations of me. In this way, 
Chairman Murayama did not refer to the SDPJ's return to the 
ruling coalition. 
  Democracy, the largest group in the SDPJ, has decided to 
urge

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0002 GMT on 26 June carries a live interview with 
Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ], in its regular "Sunday Discussion" program. The 
interview, conducted in the NHK Tokyo studio, is moderated by 
NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and guest commentator Naoki 
Tanaka. 
  Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Murayama: "In 
reference to the issue of forming a new government, it appears 
that the SDPJ holds a key to it. Which party do you intend to 
begin negotiations with -- the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or 
the ruling coalition parties?" 
  Murayama replies: "We have to recognize the past. We should 
return to the position we had at the time of forming the 
coalition in August last year. I think the correct order to 
proceed by is that all the people who participated at that time 
return to that position and restart from zero in discussing how 
the government should be formed." 
  "What you are saying is that you will begin with the ruling 
coalition parties, right?" Yamamoto asks. 
  Murayama replies, "Yes." 
  The moderator notes: "But the coalition parties are saying 
they want to watch the negotiations taking place between the LDP 
and the SDPJ. They say their negotiations with the SDPJ on 
policy adjustments have been terminated." 
  Murayama responds: "That may be what they are saying, but as 
far as we are concerned, we have to think about the past 
history, and about what the people of the nation expect us to do 
and what they want from us. We have to proceed with 
negotiations based on this thinking. I think the people of the 
nation still strongly expect us to end the LDP governance that 
continued for 38 years and to begin a new government. We need 
to respond to these expectations. When we recognize this, we 
come to realize we should form a coalition government once 
again." The SDPJ head adds, "But after all, negotiations need 
another party to talk to. If the negotiations do not go well, 
of course, then, it may be possible that we will think about 
what we should do next." 
  Yamamoto asserts that the coalition parties appear to have 
changed their position on the SDPJ as a possible coalition 
partner and asks for Murayama's comment. 
  Murayama replies: "It is only natural that we should think 
about the next course of action if the negotiations do not go 
well. Yesterday, Mr. Yohei Kono and Mr. Ryutaro Hashimoto [of 
the LDP] came to me and handed me a paper on the party's concept 
for forming a new government. I told them I would like to have 
time to study it. Since I have to think about the next course, 
I would like to keep the door open for talks with other parties." 
  Guest commentator Tanaka points out: "Watching the SDPJ over 
the past several days, I have noticed considerable differences 
of view within the SDPJ. For you, the most urgent issue right 
now is not to let the party break up." 
  Murayama says: "No, no. What is urgent for me is how we can 
respond to the people's expectations, by forming a new 
government." 
  The commentator then asks: "Specifically, there is said to 
be two groups in the party -- one that attaches importance to 
maintaining the coalition and the other group does not. This is 
one of the reasons for the chaotic political situation." 
  The SDPJ chairman responds: "This should not be viewed as 
the party being divided into two groups -- of one that attaches 
importance to the coalition and the other that does not. It 
should be taken as differences of view existing on conditions to 
rejoining the coalition." 
  Tanaka asks if Murayama thinks the next government will be a 
caretaker government that will serve until the next general 
election or a full-fledged government. 
  Murayama says: "It will depend on how the government will be 
composed, but it is possible that the government will be a 
temporary one that will serve until the next election." 
  Tanaka asks if Murayama thinks the LDP has changed its way 
of 
thinking. 
  Murayama says: "This question was once discussed within my 
party too. At that time, I said that the fact that Mr. Kono was 
elected its president shows the party recognized the party's 
mood, which is looking for change." Murayama adds: "There are 
people who are considered doves in the LDP. I think we can talk 
to or cooperate with them." 
  Tanaka asks Murayama if there is a possibility of the SDPJ 
cooperating with the LDP in forming a new government in case 
negotiations with the coalition parties fail. 
  Murayama says: "Umm, yes. The Diet session closes 29 June. 
If possible, we would like to name a prime minister and form a 
cabinet by then -- so that it will be able to get ready for the 
summit. We have a political task to form a new government. But 
if there is no way of doing that by 29 June, then we may have to 
extend the Diet session a little. That is what I think." 
  Yamamoto says some people in Sakigake [Harbinger] think they 
should push for Murayama as the next prime minister, and asks 
for Murayama's comment. 
  Murayama says: "This will be a coalition government. Its 
prime minister needs to be agreed on by the parties that 
participate in the coalition. Hence, I think we should not talk 
about who should be prime minister." He then says: "I do not 
think I am fit for that [position]. If my party is asked to 
form a cabinet, there are many people who are fit for that." 
  The interview with Murayama ends at 0025 GMT.
